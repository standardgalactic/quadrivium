About the authors
Laurie Mullins was formerly a principal lecturer at the University 
of Portsmouth Business School and led the Behavioural and Human 
Resource Management Group. Laurie has experience of business, local 
government, university administration and human resource manage-
ment, and for a number of years was an instructor in the Territorial 
Army. He has worked with the United Nations Association International 
Service (UNAIS), Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), ­professional and 
educational bodies including UNISON Education and as external exam-
iner for university courses and professional organisations. Laurie has 
undertaken an academic exchange at the University of Wisconsin, USA, a visiting fellowship at the Royal 
Melbourne Institute of Technology University, Australia and was a visiting lecturer in the Netherlands. 
He is also author of Essentials of Organisational Behaviour and co-author of Hospitality Management and 
Organisational Behaviour, both published by Pearson Education.
Gill Christy is a visiting lecturer in Organisational Behaviour/Human 
Resource Management (OB/HRM) at Portsmouth University. She read 
History at Cambridge, then trained and worked as a teacher before 
moving into a career in training and personnel management, achieving 
membership of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development 
in 1990. Gill spent five years at Southampton City Council before join-
ing Portsmouth Business School in 1992, where she became subject 
leader for the OB/HRM group and served a term as Head of the Human 
Resource and Marketing Management Department.
Peter Scott is a senior lecturer at the University of Portsmouth Business 
School, specialising in organisational behaviour and employee rela-
tions. He has previously taught at the University of Bath and Manchester 
Metropolitan University. Peter’s doctoral research was on craft skills and 
advanced manufacturing technology.

In an increasingly competitive environment, an understanding of the behaviour 
and actions of people at work is of particular importance. The activities of an 
organisation are directed towards the attainment of certain goals and also have 
social implications. Organisational behaviour is a wide and essentially multidisci-
plinary field of enquiry and should not be considered in a vacuum but related to 
the process of management and wider organisational context and environment. 
Broadening the scope of the subject matter beyond the concerns of tradi-
tional organisational behaviour texts is a distinctive feature of this book, 
which is especially suitable across a range of different but related modules, 
including single or double semester units.
The underlying theme of the book is the need for effective organisational perfor-
mance and development based on an understanding of the behaviour of people at 
work and the role of management as an integrating activity. The concepts and ideas 
presented provide a basis for contrasting perspectives on the structure, operation and 
management of organisations, and interactions among people who work in them.
Aims of this book
The aims of this book are to:
● relate the study of organisational behaviour with that of management;
● provide an integrated view embracing both theory and practice;
● point out applications of social science and cultural influences, and implications 
for management action;
● indicate ways in which organisational performance may be improved through 
better understanding of effective management of people;
● increase awareness of, and sensitivity to, personal skills and employability.
The comprehensive coverage and progressive presentation of contents will appeal to 
students at undergraduate level or on related professional courses, and to graduate 
and post-experience students who, through their course of study, wish to enhance 
their knowledge and understanding of the subject area. The book will hopefully also 
appeal to those aspiring to a managerial position.
Distinctive format
There is a logical flow to the sequencing of topic areas and each chapter of the 
book is self-contained, with appropriate cross-referencing to other chapters. 
This provides a flexible approach. Selection and ordering of chapters can be varied 
to suit the demands of particular courses of study or individual interests.
About this book

About this book
xviii
The book is written with a minimum of technical terminology and the format is 
clearly structured. Each chapter is supported with illustrations and practical exam-
ples and contains:
● a short introduction and learning outcomes;
● critical review and reflections throughout the text;
● a practical management and organisational behaviour in action case study;
● a pictorial concept map;
● a summary of ten key points to remember;
● review and discussion questions;
● an assignment;
● a personal skills and employability exercise;
● a case study;
● detailed notes and references.
For each part of the book there is also an academic viewpoint and integrative  
case study.
The eleventh edition
The book retains the same underlying aims and approach that have been a hallmark 
of its success. In response to clear user and reviewer feedback, there is a noticeable 
reduction in the size of this edition. Based on this feedback, certain subject areas 
have been integrated into other chapters to provide a more succinct format.
The book is structured in four parts with a total of sixteen chapters.
Following the revised structure, there is considerable reordering throughout. 
Attention has been focused on the overall plan of the book and sequence of contents 
between and within chapters. Strategy is now included in Chapter 14: ‘Strategy, corpo-
rate responsibility and ethics’. Certain chapters are renamed to reflect more accurately 
their contents. Each chapter has been reworded or substantially rewritten as neces-
sary. Words set in colour throughout the main text indicate inclusion in the Glossary.
Every effort has been made to balance a smaller text with the inclusion of new 
material and additional features without detracting from the continuing appeal of 
the book. These changes provide a new and fresh look while enhancing ease of 
readability, which is another key feature of the book. In addition:
● There are eleven revised or completely new management and organisational 
behaviour in action case studies, seven new concept maps and nine revised or 
completely new assignments.
● The section on personal skills and employability has been rewritten and expanded. 
There are five completely new end-of-chapter exercises. There is also a review of 
personal skills and employability at the end of the book.
● There are now an average of ten critical review and reflections throughout each 
chapter and a summary of ten key points to remember at the end of each chapter.
● All end-of-chapter case studies have been revised and updated where necessary. 
There are four completely new chapter case studies.

About this book
xix
● For each part of the book there is a completely new academic viewpoint.
● The end-of-part integrative case studies have been revised and updated as 
necessary and there is a completely new case study for Part 4.
Attention continues to be focused on design features and overall appear-
ance to provide a manageable and attractive text with enhanced clarity and 
user-friendliness.
Personal skills and employability
The Confederation for British Industry (CBI) points out that in an increasingly com-
petitive employment market, employers are looking beyond simple academic 
achievement when considering applicants for a job or internship.
Many now expect to see evidence of other skills and achievements that boost 
someone’s attractiveness as a potential employee. Businesses want graduates who 
not only add value but who have the skills to help transform their organization 
in the face of continuous and rapid economic and technological change. 
All graduates – whatever their degree disciple – need to be equipped with 
employability skills.1
The UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) aims to raise UK 
­prosperity and opportunity by improving employment and skills levels across the 
UK, benefitting individuals, employers, government and society. Recent years have 
seen attention given by the government and other employment and professional 
bodies to the importance of the supply and application of skills attainment for the 
prosperity of the UK economy. For example, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and 
Development (CIPD) points out that, for individuals, skills determine their employ-
ment and earning potential and, for the organisation, skills are vital to ­current and 
future demands.2
University education and employability
One of the recommendations in a report from the Chartered Management Institute 
(CMI) on the future of management and leadership is to ‘build employability 
into education’. The report outlines a series of practical proposals to help embed 
­practical management, enterprise and leadership experiences into the world of 
­education: ‘The standing of business studies courses should be reviewed to ensure 
they are relevant, attractive to young people and respected by employers and 
higher education.’3
UKCES reports that higher education is well placed to play its part in help-
ing to overcome the well-documented skills challenge: ‘Collaborations between 
­employers and universities have a significant role to play in providing the supply 
of highly skilled people to meet demand from businesses now and in the future.’4 
GOV.UK refers to the need for a better connection to bridge the gap between edu-
cation and work. Attention should be focused on ‘Real results, not exam results. 
Success should be measured by a wide set of outcomes, including jobs and progres-
sion, not just qualifications.’5
The Prince’s Trust also points out the human cost of skills shortages that could 
affect levels of productivity and morale among existing workforces.6

About this book
xx
People management and social skills
A survey report on tomorrow’s leaders suggests that managers recognise the 
­potential benefits of management qualifications that help improve young people’s 
practical skills. Managers were asked to select three factors with the biggest impact 
on their decision-making when recruiting young people. In two-thirds of cases 
managers highlight personal presentation, three out of five point to academic quali-
fications and half focus on an individual’s ambition: ‘This suggests that managers 
are often looking at characteristics that demonstrate an individual’s potential rather 
than fully fledged skills themselves.’7
Unlike technical or practical skills, social skills are more intangible. They are 
­difficult to get a firm hold of, or to define and measure clearly. Social skills are often 
associated as ‘soft skills’ and regarded as a natural part of human behaviour. As a 
result, a common concern with attention to the skills shortage is a lack of focus 
on people management, social skills and interpersonal behaviour. For example, an 
important aspect of working with other people and leadership skills is an awareness 
and acceptance of individual differences and diversity.
The skills imperative
The European Commission has drawn attention to ‘the skills imperative’ and points 
out the importance of a skills policy to raising productivity. For the first time, skills 
are part of the portfolio of a European Commissioner. The EU is promoting a ‘learn-
ings outcome’ approach focusing on what people actually know, understand and 
are able to do, no matter where and how they acquired their knowledge, skills and 
competencies. Focusing on what people can actually do breaks down the divide 
between the world of education and the world of work. In-demand skills include 
the ability to plan and manage projects in order to achieve objectives and transver-
sal skills such as language, problem-solving, communication, ability and willingness 
to keep learning, and the ability to work with others.8
Developing your employability skills
Increasingly, graduate recruiters are placing greater emphasis on key interpersonal 
and social skills, and attitudes. A first step in working harmoniously and effectively 
with other people is to know and understand yourself and the skill of self-manage-
ment. Reflecting honestly on your personal strengths and weaknesses should help 
develop your level of competence. You cannot even begin to think of managing 
other people until you can effectively manage yourself.
The continual development of employability skills as part of your university edu-
cation and lifelong learning is important for:
● progressing your personal confidence and self-awareness;
● developing harmonious interpersonal relationships with colleagues and external 
contacts;
● initial attractiveness for appointment with a potential employer;
● maintaining a competent level of work performance;
● enhancing work motivation and job satisfaction; and
● helping to safeguard your career progression.

About this book
xxi
Many employers have structured programmes for the continued development of 
their staff. Your longer-term employment prospects will be enhanced when you are 
able to demonstrate a genuine and enthusiastic commitment to your own personal 
development.
Study as an aid to practice
Study is an aid to practice. An underlying aim of this book is to provide an integrated 
view embracing both theory and practice. The ideas and concepts discussed pro-
vide you with opportunities to explore the underlying skills associated with man-
agement and organisational behaviour.
As you progress through your studies, reflect upon what you have read and about 
the importance of social skills, including:
● personal awareness and how you project yourself;
● openness to diversity, equality and inclusion;
● perceiving and understanding other people;
● written, verbal and non-verbal communications;
● social interactions with others and teamworking;
● persuasiveness and leadership;
● personal organisation and time management;
● coping with change;
● coaching and mentoring; and
● working in a multicultural society.
The critical review and reflection sections throughout each chapter are contro-
versial statements to help provoke and inspire personal reflection about areas you 
have just read. Draw upon the views of your colleagues to share experiences and 
test not only your assumptions and ideas, but also your skills of group interaction 
and influencing other people. References to the importance of skills throughout the 
text, together with the exhibits, case studies and assignments, should serve to stimu-
late your awareness of the importance of underlying personal and employability 
skills necessary for effective performance.
You are encouraged to complement your reading by drawing upon your own 
observations and practical experiences. This can, of course, be from your university. 
You may also have work experience, even part-time or casual employment, in other 
organisations to draw upon. In addition, you will have contact with a range of other 
organisations such as supermarkets, local pubs and shops, banks or building socie-
ties, fast food restaurants, service stations, doctors or a dentist surgery. An analytical 
approach to contemporary examples from your own observations should help fur-
ther your interest in the subject area.
Bear in mind that opportunities to develop personal skills are not always immediately 
apparent but embedded into your course of study. Adopt an inquisitive and enquiring 
mind. Search for both good and bad examples of organisational behaviour and people 
management, and the manner in which concepts and ideas presented in this book 
are applied in practice. Make a point of continually observing and thinking about the 
interpersonal and work-based skills exhibited. Use this awareness and knowledge to 
enhance development of your own employability skills and aid career progression.

Monitor and assess your development
It is recommended strongly that you maintain a portfolio of what you have learned 
in your personal development and the employability skills you have attained or 
enhanced during your course of study. This can provide a useful basis of discussion 
with a potential employer.
You may find it useful to assess progression of your personal skills and employ-
ability by reviewing your learning and development under the broad headings 
shown in the illustration.

Personal skills and employability exercises
Critical self-reflection is a positive activity that can challenge narrow preconceived 
thought processes, encourage creativity and provide a valuable personal learning 
and development experience.
At the end of each chapter there is a personal skills and employability exercise. 
This is designed to encourage you to think about further development of your social 
and work-based skills.
At the end of the book is a review of features within the text that relate to employ-
ability skills. You are encouraged to examine the extent to which you have enhanced 
your personal awareness and knowledge, and are better prepared to demonstrate 
your employability skills and aid your career progression.

Part 1
The organisational setting

 CHaPtEr 1 
 Understanding organisational behaviour 
 in an increasingly global and competitive business environment, 
particular attention must be given to organisational eff ectiveness. it 
is people who are the organisation. it is important to recognise the 
main infl uences on behaviour in work organisations, the eff ective 
management of the human resource and the nature of the people–
organisation relationship. 
 Learning outcomes 
 After completing this chapter you should have enhanced your ability to: 
 ●  explain the nature and main features of organisational behaviour; 
 ●  detail contrasting perspectives on orientations to work and the work ethic; 
 ●  evaluate the nature and importance of the psychological contract; 
 ●  explain the relevance of the Peter Principle and Parkinson’s law; 
 ●  outline the importance of management as an integrating activity; 
 ●  assess the impact of globalisation and the international context; 
 ●  debate the signifi cance of culture for organisational behaviour. 
Critical review and refl ection
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Although a commonly used term, organisational behaviour is a misnomer. rarely do all members act collectively in 
such a way as to represent the behaviour of the organisation as a whole. in practice, we are talking about the atti-
tudes and actions of individuals or small groups within the organisation. 
 What do YOU see as the signifi cance of this comment? What term would YOU suggest best explains the subject area 
of organisational behaviour?

Chapter 1  Understanding organisational behaviour
The significance of organisational behaviour
A major report from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) on the state of UK manage-
ment and leadership points out that the UK lags behind its competitors in terms of productiv-
ity and management practice and reminds us that: ‘At its heart, the art of management is the 
art of managing people.’
But, worryingly, this is where British managers fall down most. We need a change in attitude 
in the UK, whereby management is seen as a highly professional role where integrity is seen 
as a virtue, and where ethics are valued as highly as profitability.1
Increasing recognition is given to the demand not only for technical skills alone, but also for 
good people skills as a basis of organisational effectiveness. The importance of skills includ-
ing understanding human behaviour and interpersonal skills is a wide and frequent source of 
attention, including government agencies such as The UK Commission for Employment and 
Skills (UKCES), The Department of Business Innovation & Skills, and other bodies such as 
the Prince’s Trust, the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) and professional 
institutes. Against this backdrop the study of organisational behaviour can be seen of even 
greater significance.
Organisational Behaviour is one of the most complex and perhaps least understood academic 
elements of modern general management, but since it concerns the behaviour of people 
within organisations it is also one of the most central  .  .  .  its concern with individual 
and group patterns of behaviour makes it an essential element in dealing with the complex 
behavioural issues thrown up in the modern business world.2
Vecchio suggests three reasons for studying organisational behaviour:
● Important practical applications that follow from an understanding and knowledge of 
organisational behaviour and the ability to deal effectively with others in an organisational 
setting.
● Personal growth and the fulfilment gained from understanding our fellow humans. Under-
standing others may also lead to greater self-knowledge and self-insight.
● Increased knowledge about people in work settings, for example the identification of 
major dimensions of leadership leading to the design leadership training programmes in 
organisations.3
At its most basic level, organisational behaviour (OB) is concerned with the study of the 
behaviour of people within an organisational setting. It involves the understanding, prediction 
and control of human behaviour. Common definitions of organisational behaviour are gener-
ally along the lines of: the study and understanding of individual and group behaviour and 
patterns of structure in order to help improve organisational performance and effectiveness.
However much of a cliché, the inescapable fact is that people are the main resource of any 
organisation. Without its members, an organisation is nothing; an organisation is only as 
good as the people who work within it. In today’s increasingly dynamic, global and competi-
tive environment, understanding human behaviour at work and effective management of the 
people resource are even more important for organisational survival and success.
A managerial approach
There is a multiplicity of interrelated factors that influence the decisions and actions of 
people as members of a work organisation. The scope for the examination of organi-
sational behaviour is therefore very wide. It has always been a feature of this book to 
acknowledge that while the role, responsibilities and actions of management are, of 
course, subject to debate, what cannot be denied is the growing importance of effective 

part 1 The orgAnisATionAl seTTing

management, however it is perceived, to the successful performance of work organisa-
tions. Clearly, organisational behaviour does not encompass the whole of management. 
Equally clearly, however, there is a close relationship between organisational behaviour 
and management theory and practice. Some writers still appear critical of a managerial 
approach to organisational behaviour. What is also apparent, however, is that in recent 
years a number of books on organisational behaviour have paid increasing attention to 
aspects of management and managerial behaviour.  
 a multidisciplinary perspective 
 The bottom line is that sooner or later every organisation has to perform successfully if it is to 
survive. In order to study the behaviour of people at work it is necessary to understand inter-
relationships with other variables that together comprise the total organisation. Whatever the 
approach, the study of organisational behaviour cannot be undertaken entirely in terms of a 
single discipline. It is necessary to recognise the infl uences of a multidisciplinary, behavioural 
science perspective. 
 Although there are areas of overlap among the various social sciences and related disciplines 
such as economics and political science, the study of human behaviour can be viewed in terms 
of three main disciplines –  psychology,  sociology  and  anthropology.  All three disciplines have 
made an important contribution to the fi eld of organisational behaviour ( see  Figure  1.1 ).  
 A  psychological approach has its main emphasis on the individuals of which the organi-
sation is comprised. The main focus of attention is on the individual as a whole person, or 
what can be termed the ‘personality system’, including, for example, perception, attitudes 
and motives. Psychological aspects are important but by themselves provide too narrow an 
approach for the understanding of management and organisational behaviour. Our main con-
cern is not with the complex detail of individual diff erences and attributes per se, but with the 
behaviour and management of people within an organisational setting. 
 A  sociological approach has a broader emphasis on human behaviour in society. Sociologi-
cal aspects can be important. The main focus of attention is on the analysis of social struc-
tures and positions in those structures – for example, the relationship between the behaviour 
of leaders and followers. A number of sociology writers seem set on the purpose of criticising 
traditional views of organisation and management. Many of the criticisms and limitations 
to which such writers refer are justifi ed and help promote healthy academic debate. However, 
much of the argument tends to be presented in the abstract and is lacking in constructive ideas 
on how, in practical terms, action can be taken to improve organisational performance. 
 Anthropologists are more concerned with the science of humankind and the study of 
human behaviour as a whole. As far as organisational behaviour is concerned, the main focus 
of attention is on the cultural system, the beliefs, customs, ideas and values within a group or 
society, and the comparison of behaviour among diff erent cultures – for example, the impor-
tance to Muslim women of wearing trousers to work. People learn to depend on their cul-
ture to give them security and stability and they can suff er adverse reactions to unfamiliar 
environments. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 The best way to appreciate the nature and applied skills of organisational behaviour is when study of the subject area 
is related to an understanding of the importance of management to effective work organisations. 
 To what extent do YOU support this contention? Do YOU believe a managerial approach is an aid to YOUR future 
career ambitions?

Chapter 1  Understanding organisational behaviour
The contribution of relevant aspects of psychology, sociology and anthropology underpins 
the field of organisational behaviour. In terms of the applications of behavioural science to the 
management of people, we need also to consider the relevance and applications of philosophy, 
ethics and the law.
Interrelated influences on behaviour
This multidisciplinary perspective provides contrasting but related approaches to the under-
standing of human behaviour in organisations and presents a number of alternative path-
ways and levels of analysis. For our purposes, the study of organisational behaviour embraces 
broad parameters within which a number of interrelated dimensions can be identified – the 
individual, the group, the organisation and the environment – which collectively influence 
behaviour in work organisations.
The individual – organisations are made up of their individual members. The individual 
is a central feature of organisational behaviour, whether acting in isolation or as part of a 
group, in response to expectations of the organisation, or as a result of the influences of the 
external environment. Where the needs of the individual and the demands of the organisa-
tion are incompatible, this can result in frustration and conflict. It is the role of manage-
ment to integrate the individual and the organisation and to provide a working environment 
that permits the satisfaction of individual needs as well as the attainment of organisational 
goals.
The group – groups exist in all organisations and are essential to their working and 
­performance. The organisation comprises groups of people, and almost everyone in an organ-
isation will be a member of one or more groups. Informal groups arise from the social needs 
of people within the organisation. People in groups influence each other in many ways and 
groups may develop their own hierarchies and leaders. Group pressures can have a major influ-
ence over the behaviour and performance of individual members. An understanding of group 
structure and behaviour complements knowledge of individual behaviour and adds a further 
dimension to the study of organisational behaviour.
Figure 1.1  Organisational behaviour: a multidisciplinary approach

Part 1  The organisational setting
6
The organisation – individuals and groups interact within the structure of the formal 
organisation. Structure is created to establish relationships between individuals and groups, 
to provide order and systems and to direct the efforts of the organisation into goal-seeking 
activities. It is through the formal structure that people carry out their organisational activities 
to achieve aims and objectives. Behaviour is influenced by patterns of structure, technology, 
styles of leadership and systems of management through which organisational processes are 
planned, directed and monitored.
The environment – applications of organisational behaviour and the effective manage-
ment of people at work take place in the context of the wider environmental setting, including 
the changing patterns of organisations and work. The organisation functions as part of the 
broader external environment, which affects the organisation through, for example, interna-
tionalisation, technological and scientific development, economic activity, social and cultural 
influences, governmental actions, and corporate responsibility and ethical behaviour. The 
increasing rate of change in environmental factors has highlighted the need to study the total 
organisation and the processes by which the organisation attempts to adapt to the external 
demands placed upon it.
A framework of study
The use of separate topic areas is a recognised academic means of aiding study and expla-
nation of the subject. In practice, however, the activities of an organisation and the role of 
management cannot be isolated neatly into discrete categories. The majority of actions are 
likely to involve a number of simultaneous functions that relate to the total processes within 
an organisation. Consider, for example, a manager briefing departmental staff on a major 
unexpected, important and urgent task. Such a briefing is likely to include consideration of 
goals and objectives, organisation and role structures, management systems, known problem 
areas, forms of communications, delegation and empowerment, teamwork, leadership style, 
motivation and control systems. The behaviour of the staff will be influenced by a combina-
tion of individual, group, organisational and environmental factors.
Topics studied in organisational behaviour should not be regarded, therefore, as entirely 
free-standing. Any study inevitably covers several aspects and is used to a greater or lesser 
extent to confirm generalisations made about particular topic areas. Reference to the same 
studies to illustrate different aspects of management and organisational behaviour serves as 
useful revision and reinforcement and provides a more integrated approach to your study.
In order to study the behaviour of people at work it is necessary to understand interrela-
tionships with other variables that together comprise the total organisation. As has been said 
before, the bottom line is that sooner or later every organisation has to perform successfully 
if it is to survive. (Organisational performance and effectiveness are discussed in Chapter 16.)
The study of organisational behaviour embraces, therefore, an understanding of the inter-
actions among:
● the nature and purpose of the organisation, its aims and objectives;
● formal structure and role relationships;
● the tasks to be undertaken and technology employed;
● organisational processes and the execution of work;
● the human element, informal organisation and behaviour of people;
● the process of management as an integrating and co-ordinating activity;
● social responsibilities and business ethics;
● the external environment of which the organisation is part; and
● the need for organisation success and survival.
This provides us with a basic, but convenient, framework of study (see Figure 1.2).

Chapter 1  Understanding organisational behaviour
Relevance of theory
You should not be put off by the use of the word ‘theory’ in your studies. Most rational deci-
sions are based on some form of theory. Theory provides a sound basis for action and contains 
a message on how managers might behave. This will influence attitudes towards management 
practice and lead to changes in actual patterns of behaviour. It further provides a conceptual 
framework and gives a perspective for the practical study of the subject. Together they lead to 
a better understanding of factors influencing patterns of behaviour in work organisations and 
applications of the process of management.4 As McGregor expresses it:
Every managerial act rests on assumptions, generalizations, and hypotheses – that is to say, 
on theory. Our assumptions are frequently implicit, sometimes quite unconscious, often con-
flicting; nevertheless, they determine our predictions that if we do a, b will occur. Theory and 
practice are inseparable.5
Patching suggests that all managers who think about what they do are practical students of 
organisational theory:
Theory is not something unique to academics, but something we all work with in arriving 
at our attitudes, beliefs and decisions as managers. It seems obvious to most of us that 
some theories are better than others. Many managerial discussions which we undertake 
in meetings focus upon trying to agree upon which theory will be best for a particular 
decision.6

 Organisational metaphors 
 Organisations are complex social systems that can be defi ned and studied in a number of ways. 
A signifi cant approach to this broad perspective on the nature of organisations and organi-
sational behaviour is provided by  Morgan. Through the use of metaphors, Morgan identi-
fi es eight diff erent ways of viewing organisations – as machines, organisms, brains, cultures, 
political systems, psychic prisons, fl ux and transformation, and instruments of domination. 
According to Morgan, these contrasting metaphors aid the understanding of the complex 
nature of organisational life and the critical evaluation of organisational phenomena. 7 
 These contrasting metaphors off er an interesting perspective on how to view organisations. 
They provide a broader view of the dynamics of organisational behaviour and how to man-
age and design organisations. However, Morgan points out that these metaphors are not fi xed 
categories and are not mutually exclusive. An organisation can be a mix of each and pre-
dominantly a combination of two or three metaphors. Furthermore, these combinations may 
change over a period of time. 
 A number of writers use metaphors to help describe organisations. For example, in discuss-
ing the role and logic of viewing the organisation in terms of metaphors,  Drummond raises 
questions such as what an organisation is like and the power of metaphors in shaping our 
thinking, but also points out that all metaphors are partial and no metaphor can explain fully 
a particular phenomenon. 8 
 realities of organisational behaviour 
 However one looks at the nature or disciplines of organisational behaviour it is important to 
remember, as  Morgan points out, ‘the reality of organisational life usually comprises numer-
ous diff erent realities!’ 9 
 Hellriegel et al. suggest: 
 One way to recognise why people behave as they do at work is to view an organisation as an 
iceberg. What sinks ships isn’t always what sailors can see, but what they can’t see. 10 
 The overt, formal aspects focus only on the tip of the iceberg (organisation). It is just as impor-
tant to focus on what you can’t see – the covert, behavioural aspects ( see  Figure  1.3 ). 
 Egan refers to the importance of the shadow side of the organisation: that is, those things 
not found on organisation charts or in company manuals – the covert, and often undiscussed, 
activities of people, which aff ect both the productivity and quality of the working life of an 
organisation. 11 As  Howes points out, the fi ercest battles of the workplace may seem trivial 
yet they are nothing of the sort. Underlying and unresolved disputes can brew animosity and 
resentment, and halt production. 
 Forget disagreements over strategies or policy – many of the bitterest workplace battles are 
fought over the prosaic matters of air conditioning and in-oﬃ  ce music. 12 
 Watson reminds us that the biggest challenge we face when trying to analyse or to manage 
organisations is that they do not actually exist. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 The purpose of theory is often misunderstood. Theory helps in building a framework of study and generalised mod-
els applicable to a range of different organisations or situations. 
 What is YOUR view? How does a knowledge of underlying theory help YOUR study of management and organisa-
tional behaviour?

Chapter 1  Understanding organisational behaviour
The organisation in which you work or study is not something you can see, hear, touch, smell, kick, 
kiss or throw up in the air. And this is not just because you might be a relatively junior member 
of that organisation. The top managers of the organisation are no more capable than you are of 
relating to the organisation as if it existed in a straightforward way. This, in fact, is one of the most 
fascinating aspects of organisational and managerial work – and its essential ambiguity.13
Looking outside organisations
Wilson suggests that the meaning of the term ‘organisational behaviour’ is far from clear. 
She challenges what constitutes organisational behaviour and questions whether we should 
be interested only in behaviour that happens within organisations. There is a reciprocal rela-
tionship in what happens within and outside organisations. Wilson suggests that we also look 
outside of what are normally thought of as organisations and how we usually think of work. 
We can also gain insight into organisational life and behaviour by looking at what happens 
in rest and play, considering emotion and feeling, considering the context in which work is 
defined as men’s or women’s work and looking at less organised work – for example, work on 
the fiddle and the meaning of work for the unemployed.14 These suggestions arguably add an 
extra dimension to the meaning and understanding of organisational behaviour.
What is work?
In a classic 1932 essay ‘In Praise of Idleness’, Bertrand Russell puts forward an interesting view 
that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organised diminution of work.

Part 1  The organisational setting
10
First of all: what is work? Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near 
the earth’s surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The 
first kind is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid. The second kind 
is capable of indefinite extension: there are not only those who give orders, but those who 
give advice as to what orders should be given. Usually two opposite kinds of advice are given 
simultaneously by two organised bodies of men, this is called politics. The skill required for 
this kind of work is not knowledge of the subjects as to which advice is given, but knowledge 
of the art of persuasive speaking and writing, i.e. of advertising. Throughout Europe, though 
not in America, there is a third class of men, more respected than either of the classes of 
workers, there are men who, through ownership of land, are able to make others pay for the 
privilege of being allowed to exist and to work. These landowners are idle, and I might there-
fore be expected to praise them. Unfortunately their idleness is only rendered possible by the 
industry of others; indeed their desire for comfortable idleness is historically the source of the 
whole gospel of work. The last thing they have ever wished is that others should follow their 
example.15
Whatever your view of this essay, what is clear is how the nature of work itself has changed 
over the past eighty years. From work primarily as a wage and means of survival to the growth 
and power of trade unions, an emphasis on manufacturing and apprenticeship with repeti-
tive mundane work, few professionally qualified managers and the development of business 
schools, labour disputes, discord and mass industrial relations, broadening work horizons but 
times of uncertainty, rapid pace of change, working longer and harder, more flexible working, 
and the impact of information technology.16
Donkin, however, maintains that for most citizens everywhere work remains about earning 
a living and not much else.17 For most people today, work in one form or another is clearly a 
major part of their lives, and many people spend a large proportion of their time working.
Orientations to work and the work ethic
People differ in the manner and extent of their involvement with, and concern for, work. From 
information collected about the work situation, organisational participation and involvement 
with work colleagues, and life outside the organisation, Goldthorpe et al. identified three main 
types of orientation to work: instrumental, bureaucratic and solidaristic.18
● Individuals with an instrumental orientation define work not as a central life issue but in 
terms of a means to an end. There is a calculative or economic involvement with work and 
a clear distinction between work-related and non-work-related activities.
● Individuals with a bureaucratic orientation define work as a central life issue. There is a 
sense of obligation to the work of the organisation and a positive involvement in terms of a 
career structure. There is a close link between work-related and non-work-related activities.
● Individuals with a solidaristic orientation define the work situation in terms of group 
activities. There is an ego involvement with work groups rather than with the organisation 
itself. Work is more than just a means to an end. Non-work activities are linked to work 
relationships.
Opportunities and choices
According to Bunting, although some people in poorly paid jobs requiring long hours do not 
have other options, for the majority there is a degree of choice in how hard they work. People 
make their own choices. If they want to work hard, or if they wish to opt out and live the good 
life, it is up to them.19 As the number of baby-boomers (born between 1946 and 1963 and typi-
fied by a search for security) declines and the proportion of Generation Y (born between 1980 
and 1995 and typified by travel first, then a career) increases, this will have a further impact on 
the future world of work.20 (See also a fuller discussion in Chapter 3.)

Chapter 1 UndersTAnding orgAnisATionAl behAvioUr
 Some people may well have a set motivation to work, whatever the nature of the work envi-
ronment. However, diff erent work situations may also infl uence the individual’s orientation 
to work. For example, the lack of opportunities for teamwork and the satisfaction of social 
expectations may result in an instrumental orientation to work and a primary concern for 
economic interests such as pay and security. In other situations where there are greater oppor-
tunities to satisfy social needs, membership of work groups may be very important and indi-
viduals may have a more solidaristic orientation to work. This often appears to be the case, for 
example, with people working in the hospitality industry. 
 a sense of identity 
 Work can help fulfi l a number of purposes including providing the individual with a sense of 
identity. Many people see themselves primarily in terms of their career and what they do at 
work. It defi nes who they are.  Waller suggests that work inevitably plays a key role in shaping 
identity, and at least there you are challenging yourself, developing and learning. 
   In the knowledge economy, where responsibilities morph and working hours are fl exible, the 
boundaries between work and free time blur, and it’s hard for many of us to tell when we’re 
off -duty. It follows that if people are getting absorbed by their work-life, they expect their job 
to help them to discover and develop themselves. Identity can be linked to such basics as the 
satisfaction of a job well done – yet in a modern economy, work is rarely actually ‘fi nished’. 21 
 For some people who do not necessarily have any fi nancial motivation, work appears to provide 
a sense of purpose and a structure to their day. It is often even explained as ‘a reason to get up in 
the morning’.  
 Cultural infl uences 
 National culture is also a signifi cant infl uence on orientations to work. For example,  Reeves 
comments on the importance of conversation for eff ective organisational relationships but 
how this is resisted in the UK work culture. 
 The Protestant version of the work ethic prevails, implying heads-down work, focused agen-
das, punctuality, eﬃ  ciency. In French and Spanish oﬃ  ces, it takes the fi rst hour to kiss every-
one, the second to discuss local gossip and the third to pop out for a coff ee and croissant. In 
Britain, these activities would count as sexual harassment, time-wasting and absenteeism. 
Many fi rms have built cafés or break out areas and then discovered people are too scared to 
use them for fear of looking work-shy. 22 
 McCrum refers to a key division in the international world as that between those who live to 
work and those who work to live. 
   The American appetite for putting work fi rst, even to the extent of giving up weekends, will 
not be understood in much of mainland Europe or Latin America. Here, regular time off  is 
regarded as essential for family and friends and a go-getting ‘familiarisation weekend’ would 
be particularly unwelcome. In the East, of course, the Japanese take their work just as seri-
ously as the Americans. 23 (Work/life balance is discussed in  Chapter  3 .) 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 An individual’s orientation to work and underlying work ethic is the strongest influence on his or her motivation and 
organisational performance. The actions of management have only minimal effect. 
 To what extent do YOU agree with this contention and to what extent is it true for YOU? How would YOU explain 
YOUR own orientation to work and the work ethic?

Social exchange theory
An important feature that underlies the behaviour and interrelationships of people at work is that 
of social exchange theory. Rooted in cultural anthropology and economics, the central premise 
of social exchange theory is that a fundamental feature of human interaction is the exchange of 
social and material resources.24 Social behaviour is determined by an exchange process. When 
people enter into a relationship with some other person, there is the expectation of obtaining 
some kind of reward or benefit in exchange for giving something to the other person in return. 
Individuals will seek to achieve a positive balance for themselves by maximising the benefits and 
minimising the costs of such exchanges. Social exchanges are influenced by a complex web of 
power relationships and as a result are not always equal but have an uneven balance of outcomes.25
Exchanges are viewed in terms of a subjective cost–benefit analysis. Benefits and costs can 
be financial, material, time, social, status, emotional or opportunistic. In different relationships 
there will be different expectations of the content and balance of the exchange, for example 
between a senior manager and subordinate or between fellow team members. The level of sat-
isfaction from the exchange will depend not just upon the actual outcomes but on the individu-
al’s expectation of likely outcomes. The perceived outcomes of a present relationship may also 
be viewed in consideration of both past relationships and potential future relationships. The 
nature of social exchanges impacts upon many other subject areas including the psychologi-
cal contract, individual differences and diversity, communications, equity theory of motivation, 
group behaviour, leadership and management, control and power, and organisational culture.
The psychological contract
One significant aspect of organisational behaviour, which has its roots in social exchange the-
ory and the relationship between the individual and the process of management, is the concept 
of the psychological contract. This is not a written document or part of a formal agreement 
but implies a series of mutual expectations and satisfaction of needs arising from the people–
organisation relationship. The psychological contract covers a range of expectations of rights 
and privileges, duties and obligations that have an important influence on people’s behaviour. 
It is also an important factor in the socialisation of new members of staff to the organisation. 
Early experiences of the people–organisation relationship have a major effect on an individu-
al’s perception of the organisation as a place to work and the quality of management, and can 
have a major influence on job satisfaction, attitude and levels of performance.
The nature and extent of individuals’ expectations vary widely, as do the ability and will-
ingness of the organisation to meet them. It is difficult to list the range of implicit expectations 
that individuals have; these expectations also change over time. They are separate from any 
statutory requirements placed upon the organisation; they relate more to the idea of social 
responsibility of management (discussed in Chapter  14). The organisation will also have 
implicit expectations of its members. The organisational side of the psychological contract 
places emphasis on expectations, requirements and constraints that may differ from, and may 
conflict with, an individual’s expectations. Some possible examples of the individual’s and the 
organisation’s expectations are given in Figure 1.4.
Process of balancing
It is unlikely that all expectations of the individual or of the organisation will be met fully. 
There is a continual process of balancing, and explicit and implicit bargaining. The nature 
of these expectations is not defined formally, and although the individual member and the 
organisation may not be consciously aware of them, they still affect relationships between 
them and have an influence on behaviour. Stalker suggests that successful companies are those 
that have the ability to balance the unwritten needs of their employees with the needs of the 

13
Chapter 1  Understanding organisational behaviour
company. Such companies use a simple formula of Caring, Communicating, Listening, Know-
ing, Rewarding:
● Caring – demonstrating genuine concern for individuals working in the organisation.
● Communicating – really talking about what the company is hoping to achieve.
● Listening – hearing not only the words but also what lies behind the words.
● Knowing – the individuals who work for you, their families, personal wishes, desires and 
ambitions.
● Rewarding – money is not always necessary; a genuine thank-you or public recognition can 
raise morale.26
The changing nature of organisations and individuals at work has placed increasing pressures 
on the awareness and importance of new psychological contracts. Ghoshal et al. suggest the 
new management philosophy needs to be grounded in a very different moral contract with 
people. Rather than being seen as a corporate asset from which value can be appropriated, 
Figure 1.4  The psychological contract: possible examples of individual and organisational expectations

part 1 The orgAnisATionAl seTTing
14
people are seen as a responsibility and a resource to be added to. The new moral contract also 
demands much from employees, who need to abandon the stability of lifetime employment 
and embrace the concept of continuous learning and personal development. 27 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 differences in status and power mean that the psychological contract is always balanced in favour of the organisa-
tion. Managers will expect individuals to display loyalty and commitment, and put in extra hours, effort and perfor-
mance. individuals can only hope for some commensurate fair reward now or later. 
 To what extent do YOU agree with this contention? How far are the expectations YOU have of the psychological 
contract met by YOUR university or organisation? 
 the nature of human behaviour 
in organisations 
 It is convenient, here, to consider two sets of observations on the nature of organisational 
behaviour and what may actually happen, in practice, in organisations: the Peter Principle and 
Parkinson’s Law. Although presented in a satirical manner, these observations nevertheless 
make a serious and signifi cant point about the management and functioning of organisations 
and the actual nature and practice of organisational behaviour. 
 the Peter Principle 
 This is concerned with the study of occupational incompetence and the study of hierarchies. 
The analysis of hundreds of cases of occupational incompetence led to the formulation of the 
 Peter Principle, which is: 
 In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to their level of incompetence. 28 
 Employees competent in their position are promoted and competence in each new position 
qualifi es for promotion to the next highest position until a position of incompetence is reached. 
The principle is based on perceived incompetence at all levels of every hierarchy – political, 
legal, educational and industrial – and ways in which employees move upwards through a hier-
archy and what happens to them after promotion. 
 Among the many examples quoted by  Peter are those from the teaching occupation.  C, a 
competent student, teacher and head of department, is promoted to assistant principal and 
being intellectually competent is further promoted to principal.  C is now required to work 
directly with higher offi  cials. By working so hard at running the school, however,  C misses 
important meetings with superiors and has no energy to become involved with community 
organisations.  C thus becomes regarded as an incompetent principal. 
 Means of promotion 
 Peter suggests two main means by which a person can aff ect their promotion rate, ‘Pull’ and ‘Push’: 
 ●  Pull is an employee’s relationship – by blood, marriage or acquaintance – with a person 
above the employee in the hierarchy. 
 ●  Push is sometimes manifested by an abnormal interest in study, vocational training and 
self-improvement. 
 In small hierarchies, Push may have a marginal eff ect in accelerating promotion; in larger hier-
archies the eff ect is minimal. Pull is, therefore, likely to be more eff ective than Push. 
 Never stand when you can sit; never walk when you can ride; never Push when you can Pull. 29 

15
Chapter 1  Understanding organisational behaviour
Parkinson’s Law
A major feature of Parkinson’s Law is that of the ‘rising pyramid’ – that is, ‘work expands so 
as to fill the time available for its completion.’30 General recognition of this is illustrated in 
the proverb, ‘It is the busiest person who has time to spare.’ There is little, if any, relationship 
between the quantity of work to be done and the number of staff doing it. Underlying this 
general tendency are two almost axiomatic statements:
● An official wants to multiply subordinates, not rivals.
● Officials make work for each other.
Parkinson goes on to give the following example. If a civil servant, A, believes he is over-
worked, there are three possible remedies: (i) resignation; (ii) ask to halve the work by having it 
shared with a colleague, B; or (iii) seek the assistance of two subordinates, C and D. The first 
two options are unlikely. Resignation would involve loss of pension rights, while sharing work 
with a colleague on the same level would only bring in a rival for promotion. So A would pre-
fer the appointment of two junior members of staff, C and D. This would increase A’s status. 
There must be at least two subordinates, so that by dividing work between C and D, A will be 
the only person to understand the work of them both. Furthermore, each subordinate is kept 
in order by fear of the other’s promotion.
When, in turn, C complains of overwork, A, with the agreement of C, will advise the 
appointment of two assistants, E and F. However, as D’s position is much the same and, to 
avoid internal friction, two assistants, G and H, will also be recommended to help D. There 
are now seven people, A, C, D, E, F, G and H, doing what one person did before, and A’s pro-
motion is almost certain. With the seven people now employed, the second stage comes into 
operation. The seven people make so much work for each other that they are all fully occupied 
and A is actually working harder than ever.
Among other features of organisational practice that Parkinson discusses are: principles 
of personnel selection; the nature of committees; personality screen; high finance; the ‘Law 
of Triviality’, which means (in a committee) that the time spent on any agenda item will be in 
inverse proportion to the sum involved; the layout of the organisation’s administration block; 
and ‘injelitis’ – the disease of induced inferiority.
Relevance of observations
Despite the light vein of Parkinson’s writing, the relevance of his observations can be gauged 
from comments in the Introduction by HRH The Duke of Edinburgh.
The most important point about this book for serious students of management and admin-
istration is that it illustrates the gulf that exists between the rational/intellectual approach to 
human organisation and the frequent irrational facts of human nature . . . The law should 
be compulsory reading at all business schools and for all management consultants. Man-
agement structures solve nothing if they do not take the facts of human nature into proper 
consideration, and one of the most important facts is that no one really likes having to make 
decisions. Consequently structures may generate a lot of activity but little or no useful work.31
Positive organisational behaviour
A different approach to organisational behaviour is that of positive organisational behaviour 
(POB), which takes a functionalist or positivist approach. In recent years increasing attention 
has been given to positive psychology, which is defined broadly as ‘the scientific study of what 
makes life most worth living’. Although arguably originated by Maslow in his hierarchy of 
needs theory in 1954 (see Chapter 7), positive psychology is associated with the work of Martin 
Seligman in 1998.32 Rather than focus on finding out what was wrong with people – the ‘disease’ 
model – positive psychology complements traditional psychology by focusing on determining 

Part 1  The organisational setting
16
how things go right and how to enhance people’s satisfaction and well-being. According to 
Peterson, among the major concerns of positive psychology are:
positive experiences like happiness and engagement, positive traits like character strengths 
and talents, positive relationships like friendship and love, and the larger institutions like fam-
ily and school that enable these.
Peterson goes on to suggest that the topic of morale can also be placed under the positive psy-
chology umbrella. Morale is used as a cognitive, emotional and motivational stance towards 
the goals and tasks of a group. In the same way that life satisfaction is an indicator of indi-
vidual well-being, morale is an indicator of group well-being.33
Applications to the work situation
To what extent can positive psychology be applied to the work organisation? Wong and Davey 
maintain that each day, in every organisation, huge amounts of valuable resources are wasted 
because of human problems, wrong policies or poor training. The focus of leadership needs 
to be shifted from process and outcome to people and the development of social/emotional/
spiritual capital. However, although positive psychology can be introduced into the workplace, 
they question the ability of managers to apply this to employees in a meaningful way.34
Positive organisational behaviour is defined by Luthans as:
The study and application of positively oriented human resource strengths and psychologi-
cal capacities that can be measured, developed and effectively managed for performance 
improvement in today’s workplace.
This definition incorporates many existing concepts from the domains of attitudes, personal-
ity, motivation and leadership.35
Donaldson and Ko maintain that the primary emphasis of POB is in the workplace and the 
accomplishment of work-related outcomes and performance improvement. Studies of POB 
have been conducted at the micro- and meso-levels of analysis using survey research and tend 
to develop from individual to group to organisational levels of analysis. There appears to be 
potential to invigorate research and applications in the traditional fields of industrial psychol-
ogy and organisational behaviour.36
POB has been subject to much critique. According to Wright and Quick, for example, there 
still exists some measure of confusion regarding just what constitutes the realm of ‘positive’ 
behaviour, and what distinguishes the positive organisational agenda from organisational 
behaviour in general. However, despite the sceptics and critics, Wright and Quick believe that 
the role of positive organisational movement will continue to grow and prosper, and gain sig-
nificant attention in the applied sciences.37
The changing world of work organisations
Increasing business competitiveness, globalisation, shifting labour markets, rapid technologi-
cal progress, the move towards more customer-driven markets, a 24/7 society and demands 
of work/life balance have led to a period of constant change and the need for greater organi-
sational flexibility. The combination of these influences is transforming the way we live and 
work. And this clearly has significant implications for management and organisational behav-
iour. It is important to understand how organisations function and the pervasive influences 
that they exercise over the behaviour and actions of people.
The power and influence of private and public organisations, the rapid spread of new tech-
nology and the impact of various socio-economic and political factors have attracted increas-
ing attention to the concept of corporate responsibilities and business ethics (discussed in 
Chapter 14). Increasing attention is also being focused on the ethical behaviour that underlies 
the decisions and actions of people at work.
A summary of the changing context of work, including topics discussed in subsequent 
chapters, is set out in the concept map shown in Figure 1.5.

Management as an integrating activity
Whatever the individual’s orientations to work, or the nature of the work organisation or 
cultural influences, it is through the process of management that the efforts of members of 
the organisation are co-ordinated, directed and guided towards the achievement of its goals. 
Management is the cornerstone of organisational effectiveness (see Figure 1.6).
It is important always to remember that it is people who are being managed, and people 
should be considered in human terms. Unlike physical resources, the people resource is not 
owned by the organisation. People bring their own perceptions, feelings and attitudes towards 
the organisation, systems and styles of management, their duties and responsibilities, and the 
conditions under which they are working. Human behaviour is capricious and scientific meth-
ods or principles of behaviour cannot be applied with reliability. It is also widely observed that 
you cannot study the behaviour of people without changing it. At the heart of successful man-
agement is the problem of integrating the individual and the organisation, and this requires an 
understanding of both human personality and work organisations.38
Providing the right balance
People and organisations need each other. Management is an integral part of this relationship. 
It is essentially an integrating activity that permeates every facet of the organisation’s opera-
tions and should serve to reconcile the needs of people at work with the requirements of the 
organisation. Management should endeavour to create the right balance between the inter-
related elements that make up the total organisation and to weld these into coherent patterns 
Figure 1.6  Management as the cornerstone of organisational effectiveness

Chapter 1 UndersTAnding orgAnisATionAl behAvioUr
of activity best suited to the external environment in which the organisation is operating. 
Consideration must be given to developing an organisational climate in which people work 
willingly and eff ectively. 
 According to  Gratton, for example: 
   When people are engaged and committed they are more likely to behave in the interests of 
the company and they have less need to be controlled and measured. In essence, engaged 
people can be trusted to behave in the interests of the company, in part because they per-
ceived their interests to be the same as, or aligned with, the interests of the company. 39 
 The style of management adopted can be seen as a function of the manager’s attitudes towards 
people and assumptions about human nature and behaviour  (discussed in  Chapter  10 ). 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Performance of people at work is determined predominantly by the idiosyncratic behaviour of individuals and 
a complex combination of social factors and unofficial working methods. in reality, managers have only limited 
influence.

 Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines 
➔
 An increasingly signifi cant sector of the hospitality and leisure industry is that of cruise ships. The number of holi-
daymakers choosing a holiday at sea continues to rise, with a record 1.7 million UK holidaymakers taking an ocean 
cruise in 2014. 
 in an ever-growing and continually evolving cruise industry, the delivery of a memorable personal service expe-
rience is particularly signifi cant as an integral part of organisational eff ectiveness. goods and services alone are no 
longer enough and, in addition to providing a consistently high-quality product, cruise companies need to diff eren-
tiate themselves by an emotional engagement with customers and the highest levels of customer service. 40 
 Fred. olsen Cruise lines is one of the only family-run cruise lines in the world, with sailing experience going back 
over 160 years. Fred. olsen has stylish, contemporary ships built ‘on a human scale’, with capacities between 800 and 
1,350 guests, departing from ten regional UK ports. The ships are large enough to provide the facilities desired by guests, 
but small enough to enable a close exploration of a wide range of exciting destinations. emphasis is on a comfortable, 
friendly atmosphere, with a ‘country house hotel’ feel, delivered ‘with a smile’, by caring and attentive crew. guests are 
welcomed as individuals in a relaxed, familiar ambience. Among a number of recent accolades, Fred. olsen Cruise lines 
was awarded the prestigious  Which?  ‘recommended Provider’ status in the infl uential consumer body’s fi rst-ever cruise 
survey and the coveted ‘gold Trusted Merchant Accreditation’ by independent review site Feefo for 2014 and 2015. 
 successful cruise management is a combination of travel agency, hotel and leisure activities, on-board entertain-
ment and organised tours. it entails a complex and involved series of processes, both at sea and in diff erent ports 
of call, and is unlike that experienced in hardly any other business organisation. some particular factors to consider 
include, for example: 
 ●  continual heavy guest occupancy and usage, with rapid turnover, mass entry and exit; 
 ●  ‘people logistics’ – attending to the complex transportation needs of guests pre- and post-cruise, and logistics of 
a broad variety of shore excursions in diff erent locations; 
 ●  wide range of on-board activities and events throughout the day and evening; 
 ●  highest standards of safety and maintenance, logistics and tender operations; 
 ●  relationships with head offi  ce, technical department, port authorities, pilots, etc; 

part 1 The orgAnisATionAl seTTing
20
 ●  expectations of high-quality cuisine, design and mix of menus, special dietary requirements; 
 ●  crew from a diverse range of cultures and backgrounds, with long periods away from home and families; 
 ●  health and hygiene, with large numbers of guests and crew in continual close contact; 
 ●  crew resource deployment and rotation planning, with unavailability of additional agency or temporary staff , 
as with land-based organisations, and need for fl exible working practices in response to the demands of the 
business; 
 ●  accommodating annual leave requirements, fl ights for some members of the crew, and managing opportunities 
for time on shore; 
 ●  changeover of crew at the end of contracts – maintaining continuity within the business. 
 Cruising is associated with a high level of service delivery, and based on preconceived expectations passengers can be 
very demanding. Passenger satisfaction is dependent to a very large extent on day-to-day contact with – and care and 
attention from – members of the crew. Crew members work long hours, in often difficult and demanding conditions, 
and are away from their homes, and in many cases young families, for up to nine months. Management’s concern and 
support for the welfare of its crew are of prime importance. At the same time, the nature of cruising demands attention 
to a safe and secure environment, for both passengers and crew. This demands a management structure with clear 
lines of authority, directed leadership and good order. strong discipline must be maintained at all times. 
 Fred. olsen prides itself on providing exceptional service by anticipating, meeting and exceeding its guests’ 
expectations when they are on board its ships. despite the continually evolving and highly competitive nature of the 
industry, Fred. olsen attracts a high level of ‘repeat guests’ – that is, loyal customers who have cruised with the com-
pany at least once before. on a typical Fred. olsen cruise, more than half of the guests are repeat customers, which 
is one of the highest return rates of any major cruise line. A particularly noticeable feature of passenger feedback is 
the extremely favourable and complimentary comments regarding the level of attention from courteous and always

  Globalisation and the international context 
 One major challenge facing managers today arises from what many commentators have iden-
tifi ed as an increasingly international or  global business environment. In broad terms,  globali-
sation refers to organisations integrating, operating and competing in a worldwide economy. 
The organisations’ activities are more independent across the world, rather than confi ned 
nationally. The following factors are frequently cited as potential explanatory factors underly-
ing this trend: 
 ●  improvements in international information and communication facilities leading to an 
increased consciousness of diff erences in workplace attitudes and behaviour in other societies; 

21
Chapter 1  Understanding organisational behaviour
● international competitive pressure – for example, the emergence of newly industrialised 
and/or free-market nations including, for example, the Far East region and former commu-
nist bloc countries;
● increased mobility of labour;
● international business activity, for example: overseas franchising or licensing agreements; 
outsourcing of business units to other countries (call centres provide a topical example); 
direct foreign investment and the activities of multinational corporations that, by defini-
tion, operate outside national boundaries;
● greater cross-cultural awareness and acceptance of the advantages of diversity.
Globalisation will also impact on the nature of social responsibilities and business ethics. As 
organisations, and especially large business organisations, adopt a more global perspective 
this will have a significant effect on the broader context of management and organisational 
behaviour.
The future of globalisation
Globalisation has been subjected to much criticism, in part at least due to lack of clarity as to 
its exact meaning and to the confusion about organisations that are very large scale (such as 
Walmart in the USA) but have only a small proportion of their operations on a global basis. 
Globalisation has also become the subject of demonstrations and has been blamed for escalat-
ing inequalities in the developing world and endangering regional cultures. There appears to 
be a return to strong nationalistic tendencies in countries such as the USA and France.
Child points out that globalisation is a complex phenomenon and the term is used in so 
many different ways it is in danger of losing any useful purpose. Globalisation is a trend rather 
than a condition that necessarily already exists, it is not spreading evenly across the world and 
many unsubstantiated and sweeping claims have been made: ‘The trend towards globalisation 
is a strong one, but it remains to be seen how far and how fast it will spread. It has powerful 
opponents.’41
By contrast, McLean maintains that globalisation is here to stay – it will not go away and 
if anything will get worse: ‘We must face the realism that the world, and indeed organisations 
and the way they are managed, will never be the same. We must encompass these changes and 
harness the opportunities they present.’42
French, however, reminds us that social trends are, by their very nature, fluctuating. For 
example, it is quite possible that the trend for global flows of workers may decrease in impor-
tance or even be reversed in the future.43
Cultural environment
Whatever the extent of globalisation, there are clear implications for organisational behav-
iour in accommodating international dimensions of management and cultural differences. 
The importance of people in business understanding cultural differences is illustrated by IBM, 
which publishes for members of staff a comprehensive guide to the main dimensions of culture 
and business, and an introduction to concepts, tips, resources and tools for building cross-
cultural competencies across national, organisational, team and interpersonal barriers.
Another advantage of adopting a cross-cultural approach to the study of organisational 
behaviour, and to the management of people more generally, lies in the recognition of vari-
ations in workplace attitudes and behaviour between individuals and groups in different cul-
tural contexts.
As an example, in the USA there is a strong commitment to the organisation (the corpora-
tion) and work and career are taken very seriously (as the author has experienced for himself). 
Hard work is accepted as part of the American way of life and good timekeeping is important. 
It is a long-hours culture and generally there is little concern for the work/life balance. There 
is a strong emphasis on political correctness and little banter or humour at work (again as the 

part 1 The orgAnisATionAl seTTing
22
author found out to his cost), especially not in formal meetings. Americans do not like self-
deprecation and fi nd it strange that the British are prepared to laugh at themselves. 
 In China there is an enormous bureaucracy, and hierarchy is an important indication of 
authority. In the business world you may need to deal with several ascending levels of manage-
ment before reaching the senior manager. There can be an apparent lack of courtesy – and 
rather than being taken as given, respect and trust have to be earned. There is a strong supe-
rior–subordinate relationship, with staff  often undertaking menial tasks for their boss. 44 
 In Japan and Korea, where society tends to be male dominated, in the business world 
men are more likely to be taking the main role in setting agendas, communications and 
decision-making. 
 In examining the centrally important topic of motivation,  Francesco and Gold inform their 
readers: ‘Managers must develop organizational systems that are fl exible enough to take into 
account the meaning of work and the relative value of rewards within the range of cultures 
where they operate.’ 45 
 According to  Hare, we need to embrace the opportunities international management 
brings. All countries have their issues, but whatever the customs, diff erences and similarities, 
most cultures recognise the need to get something done. Successful international management 
boils down to fi ve simple principles: 
  1.  Listen well so you understand the rationale, motivations and outcomes desired by the other 
party. 
  2.  Take time to do your research and homework. 
  3.  Be courteous and polite, and mindful of local manners and customs. 
  4.  Develop good working relationships through trust and respect. 
  5.  Embrace the opportunities from international management. 46 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 national culture is not only an explanation of human beliefs, values, behaviours and actions, it is arguably the most 
significant feature underlying the study of management and organisational behaviour. 
 To what extent do YOU support this contention? What examples can YOU give in support of your view? What effect 
does national culture have in YOUR university or organisation? 
 Is organisational behaviour culture-bound? 
 While it can be valuable to apply organisational behaviour concepts to diverse cultural set-
tings, it should also be borne in mind that some  universal theories and models may, in reality, 
contain important culturally derived assumptions. When examining classical frameworks for 
understanding organisation structure  (discussed in  Chapter  2 ),  Schneider and Barsoux point 
out: ‘Theories about how best to organise – Max Weber’s (German) bureaucracy, Henri Fay-
ol’s (French) administrative model, and Frederick Taylor’s (American) scientifi c management – 
all refl ect societal concerns of the times as well as the cultural background of the individu-
als.’ 47 That writers on work organisations may themselves be infl uenced by their own cultural 
backgrounds when compiling their work is unsurprising: however, equally it should not be 
ignored. 
 More signifi cant still is the possibility that whole topics within organisational behaviour, 
per se, may be underpinned by a particular culturally derived frame of reference.  French exam-
ines the extent to which universally applicable pressures or logics eff ectively rule out signifi cant 
cultural variations in formal organisational arrangements, such as bureaucracy, as opposed to 
culture itself viewed as a variable within a range of factors infl uencing structure. 48

 Culture as understanding 
 For our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet, we all breathe the 
same air, we all cherish our children’s future, and we are all mortal. 
 John F. Kennedy, 10 June 1963 
 There are a number of very good reasons why we could usefully understand cultural diff er-
ence (and similarity) at work, based on new awareness contributing to our own eff ectiveness 
and moreover to the accomplishment of organisational goals. It could also be true to say that 
an appreciation of culture and its eff ects may be of intrinsic value. There could therefore be 
advantages to cross-cultural awareness, which include: 
 ●  increased self-awareness; 
 ●  sensitivity to diff erence and diversity; 
 ●  questioning our own assumptions and knowledge; 
 ●  lessening ignorance, prejudice and hatred. 
 However, it would be wrong to think that increased cross-cultural awareness or activity will 
automatically bring about any of these outcomes. 
 Brooks is one of several commentators who draw our attention to the interlinked nature 
of culture and commonly held values.  Figure  1.7 illustrates the interplay between relevant fac-
tors aff ecting any one national culture. 49 You may wish to consider how these factors have 
combined to shape your own ‘home’ culture and that of one other country with which you are 
familiar. 
 Above all, those aspects of organisational behaviour that focus on individual diff erences 
and diversity, groups and managing people are the most clearly aff ected by culture and it is 
essential to take a cross-cultural approach to the subject.  (Organisation culture is discussed in 
 Chapter  15 .)

 despite obvious advantages from an appreciation of culture differences and its effects, it is not easy for everyone to 
feel comfortable working in a multicultural environment.

Part 1  The organisational setting

Five dimensions of culture: the contribution 
of Hofstede
Geert Hofstede is one of the most significant contributors to the body of knowledge on cul-
ture and workplace difference. His work has largely resulted from a large-scale research pro-
gramme in the late 1960s and early 1970s involving employees from the IBM Corporation, 
initially in forty countries. In focusing on one organisation Hofstede felt that the results could 
be more clearly linked to national cultural difference. Arguing that culture is, in a memora-
ble phrase, collective programming or software of the mind, Hofstede initially identified four 
dimensions of culture: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism and masculinity.50
● Power distance relates to the social distance among people depending upon management 
style, hierarchical structure, willingness of subordinates to disagree with superiors, and the 
educational level and status accruing to particular roles.
● Uncertainty avoidance refers to the extent to which members of a society feel threatened by 
ambiguity or unusual situations or accepting of risks and uncertainty.
● Individualism describes the relatively individualistic or collectivist ethic evident in that par-
ticular society, for example the degree of respect for individual freedom or commitment to 
group membership.
● Masculinity refers to a continuum between ‘masculine’ characteristics, such as assertiveness 
and competitiveness, and ‘feminine’ traits, such as caring, a stress upon the quality of life 
and concern with the environment.
A fifth dimension of culture, long-term/short-term orientation, was originally labelled ‘Con-
fucian work dynamism’. This dimension developed from the work of Hofstede and Bond in 
an attempt to locate Chinese cultural values as they impacted on the workplace.51 Countries 
that scored highly on Confucian work dynamism or long-term orientation exhibited a strong 
concern with time along a continuum and were therefore both past and future oriented, with 
a preoccupation with tradition but also a concern with the effect of actions and policies on 
future generations.
Evaluation of Hofstede’s work
Extremely influential, the seminal work of Hofstede has been criticised from certain quarters, 
for example for its simplicity and limited practical application. In common with other writ-
ers in this area, there is a focus on the national rather than the regional level. The variations 
within certain countries, for example Spain, can be more or less significant. Again in common 
with other contributors, Hofstede’s classifications include medium categories that may be dif-
ficult to operationalise, accurate though they may be. Some may also find the ­masculinity/
femininity dimension unconvincing and itself stereotypical. Other writers have questioned 
whether Hofstede’s findings remain current. Holden summarises this view: ‘How many people 
have ever thought that many of Hofstede’s informants of three decades ago are now dead? Do 
their children and grandchildren really have the same values?’52 (See also discussion on Global 
Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) in Chapter 9.)
Cultural diversity: the contribution  
of Trompenaars
Another significant contributor to this area of study is Fons Trompenaars, whose later work is 
co-authored with Charles Hampden-Turner.53 Trompenaars’ original research spanned fifteen 
years, resulting in a database of 50,000 participants from fifty countries. It was supported by 
cases and anecdotes from 900 cross-cultural training programmes. A questionnaire method 
comprised a significant part of the study, which involved requiring participants to consider 

25
Chapter 1  Understanding organisational behaviour
their underlying norms, values and attitudes. The resultant framework identifies seven areas in 
which cultural differences may affect aspects of organisational behaviour:
● Relationships and rules. Here societies may be more or less universal, in which case there is 
relative rigidity in respect of rule-based behaviour, or particular, in which case the impor-
tance of relationships may lead to flexibility in the interpretation of situations.
● Societies may be more oriented to the individual or collective. The collective may take dif-
ferent forms: the corporation in Japan, the family in Italy or the Catholic Church in the 
Republic of Ireland. There may be implications here for such matters as individual respon-
sibility or payment systems.
● It may also be true that societies differ in the extent to which it is thought appropriate for 
members to show emotion in public. Neutral societies favour the ‘stiff upper lip’, while 
overt displays of feeling are more likely in emotional societies.
● In diffuse cultures, the whole person would be involved in a business relationship and it 
would take time to build such relationships. In a specific culture, such as the USA, the basic 
relationship would be limited to the contractual. This distinction clearly has implications 
for those seeking to develop new international links.
● Achievement-based societies value recent success or an overall record of accomplishment. 
In contrast, in societies relying more on ascription, status could be bestowed through such 
factors as age, gender or educational record.
● Trompenaars suggests that societies view time in different ways, which may in turn influ-
ence business activities. The American dream is the French nightmare. Americans generally 
start from zero and what matters is their present performance and their plan to ‘make it’ in 
the future. This is ‘nouveau riche’ for the French, who prefer the ancien pauvre; they have 
an enormous sense of the past.
● Finally it is suggested that there are differences with regard to attitudes to the environment. 
In Western societies, individuals are typically masters of their fate. In other parts of the 
world, however, the world is more powerful than individuals.
Trompenaars’ work is based on lengthy academic and field research. It is potentially useful 
in linking the dimensions of culture to aspects of organisational behaviour that are of direct 
relevance, particularly to people approaching a new culture for the first time.
High- and low-context cultures
A framework for understanding cultural difference has been formulated by Ed Hall; his work 
is in part co-authored with Mildred Reed Hall.54 Hall conceptualises culture as comprising a 
series of ‘languages’, in particular:
● language of time;
● language of space;
● language of things;
● language of friendships;
● language of agreements.
In this model of culture Hall suggests that these ‘languages’, which resemble shared attitudes 
to the issues in question, are communicated in very different ways according to whether a soci-
ety is classified as a ‘high’- or ‘low’-context culture.
The features of ‘high’-context societies, which incorporate Asian, African and Latin Amer-
ican countries, include the following:
● a high proportion of information is ‘uncoded’ and internalised by the individual;
● indirect communication styles – words are less important;
● shared group understandings;
● importance attached to the past and tradition;
● a ‘diffuse’ culture stressing the importance of trust and personal relationships in business.

part 1 The orgAnisATionAl seTTing
26
 ‘Low’-context societies, which include the USA, Australia, the UK and the Scandinavian coun-
tries, exhibit contrasting features including the following: 
 ●  a high proportion of communication is ‘coded’ and expressed; 
 ●  direct communication styles – words are paramount; 
 ●  past context is less important; 
 ●  a ‘specifi c’ culture stressing importance of rules and contracts. 
 Other countries, for example France, Spain, Greece and several Middle Eastern societies, are 
classifi ed as ‘medium’ context. 
 the importance of organisational behaviour 
 As part of the  Financial Times Mastering Management series,  Wood, in his discussion of the 
nature of organisational behaviour, suggests that in its concern for the way people behave in 
an organisational context, organisational behaviour can be regarded as the key to the whole 
area of management. 
 Is the study of behavior in organizations important? I think it is vital. What the social sciences, 
humanities and the arts are to university education, OB is to business school education. The 
more technical a manager’s training, the more important organizational behavior becomes. It 
is arguably the one area that can carry the burden of bringing the collective wisdom of human 
history into the decision-making calculus of developing managers. And this is no trivial task.  55 
 In the Foreword to Cloke and Goldsmith’s thought-provoking book  The End of Management, 
 Bennis claims that a distinct and dramatic change is taking place in the philosophy underlying 
organisational behaviour, calling forth a new concept of humanising organisations. 
 This new concept is based on an expanded knowledge of our complex and shifting needs, 
replacing an oversimplifi ed, innocent, push-button idea of humanity. This philosophical shift 
calls for a new concept of organizational values based on humanistic-democratic ideals, 
which replace the depersonalized, mechanistic value system of bureaucracy. With it comes a 
new concept of power, based on collaboration and reason, replacing a model based on coer-
cion and threat . . . The real push for these changes stems from the need not only to human-
ize organizations but to use them as crucibles for personal growth and self-realization. 56 
 Robbins and Judge remind us that there are few, if any, simple and universal principles that 
explain organisational behaviour, but that understanding organisational behaviour has never 
been more important for managers than it is today. 
 For instance, the typical employee in more developed countries is getting older; more and 
more women and people of color are in the workplace; corporate downsizing and the heavy 
use of temporary workers are severing the bonds of loyalty that historically tied many employ-
ees to their employers; and global competition is requiring employees to become more fl exible 
and to learn to cope with rapid change. The war on terror has brought to the forefront the 
challenges of working with and managing people during uncertain times. In short, there are 
a lot of challenges and opportunities today for managers to use OB concepts. 57 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 A noticeable feature of organisational behaviour is the invariable difficulty in identifying a single solution to a par-
ticular situation. The absence of one  right answer not only makes study of the subject complex and frustrating, but 
also brings into question the value of studying the subject at all. 
 What are YOUR views? Do YOU feel frustrated by the study of organisational behaviour? 

27
CHAPTER 1 UNDERSTANDING ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  At the heart of management is the art of managing people. Increasing attention is focused on 
good people skills as a basis of organisational eﬀ ectiveness. 
  2  Organisational behaviour (OB) is broadly concerned with the study of the behaviour of people 
within an organisational setting and is of even greater signiﬁ cance. 
  3  It is necessary to recognise a multidisciplinary approach. Organisational behaviour can be 
viewed in terms of interrelated aspects of the individual, the group, the organisation and the 
environment 
  4   People diﬀ er in the manner and extent of their involvement with, and concern for, work. Dif-
ferent situations inﬂ uence the individual’s orientation to work and the work ethic. 
  5  The psychological contract implies a series of informal mutual expectations and satisfaction of 
needs arising from the people–organisation relationship. 
  6   Two important observations on the nature of human behaviour and what may actually happen 
in organisations are the Peter Principle and Parkinson’s Law. 
  7   A major challenge facing managers today arises from an increasingly international or global 
business environment that also impacts on social responsibilities and ethics. 
  8   This highlights the need for a cross-cultural approach to the study of organisational behaviour 
and understanding the impact of national culture. 
  9  There are clear implications for organisational behaviour in accommodating dimensions of 
cultural diﬀ erences, and the study and understanding of workplace behaviour. 
  10  There are few absolute principles that explain organisational behaviour, but in its concern for 
the behaviour of people it has never been more important for managers. 
  1  Give your own explanation of the meaning, signiﬁ cance and scope of organisational behaviour. 
  2  Explain reasons for a multidisciplinary approach and suggest main headings under which factors inﬂ uencing 
behaviour in work organisations can best be identiﬁ ed. 
  3  To what extent do you believe people are identiﬁ ed and perceived according to the nature of the work they 
undertake? Where possible give actual examples in support of your answer. 
  4  Discuss with supporting examples the nature and signiﬁ cance of (i) social exchange theory  and (ii) the psycho-
logical contract. 
  5  Explain the extent to which you can identify with examples of organisational practices relating to (i) the Peter 
Principle  and (ii) Parkinson’s Law. 
  6  Discuss critically the role of management as an integrating activity. Give your views on the nature and impor-
tance of managerial work today. 
  7  Give your own views on the changing nature of the work organisation and speciﬁ c changes that you foresee in 
the next ten years. How do you feel about the possible changes?

 assignment 
 It is often said that people are every organisation’s most import asset. This is perfectly true but people are not 
like other assets. As well as being valuable in their own right – in terms of performance, skills and creativity – 
it is individual employees who bind every other aspect of working life together. 
 (‘The People Factor – engage your employees for business success’, ACAS, March 2014, p. 4) 
 Working in small groups, discuss critically: 
1  What this statement actually means to you and fellow members of your group. 
2  What exactly is meant by ‘individual employees binding every other aspect of working life together’? 
3  The extent to which members of staff  in your own university appear to be valued as an important asset. 
4  shared experiences within your group of any other work situations, with good and/or bad examples. 
5  Why is it that, although the importance of people as the most important asset is often preached by organisations, 
this rarely seems to be the reality.

organisational behaviour. Where possible, give your own examples. 
  10  discuss critically what you believe are the main factors to bear in mind with, and particular diffi  culties presented

 Objectives 
 Completing this exercise should help you to enhance the following skills: 
 ●  obtain a clearer picture of your own and other people’s attitudes to studying. 
 ●  explore the likely importance of work to you and your orientation to work. 
 ●  relate responses to your personal learning and development. 
 Exercise 
 Form into small groups, preferably including any colleagues whom you have not yet got to know very well and/or 
from a diff erent ethnicity. discuss openly and honestly how you each feel regarding your attitude, enthusiasm and 
motivation towards studying. For example: 
 1  What do you fi nd most satisfying about studying? 
  2  What do you fi nd least satisfying about studying? 
  3  how well are you able to concentrate on your studies? 
  4  To what extent do you enjoy studying for its own sake or only as a means to an end? 
  5  What do you fi nd most distracting or diffi  cult about your studies? 
  6  is it possible to learn how to improve the skill of studying? 
  7  What rewards most encourage you in your studying? 
  8  At what time of the day and for how long at a time do you usually study best?

 This case examines two organisations that have many 
similarities as well as a number of signiﬁ cant diﬀ erences. 
The essential technology and systems behind each 
organisation may be very similar, but the nature and 
style of management and its consequent impact on the 
way people working in these organisations think, feel 
and behave has created very diﬀ erent organisational 
cultures. So what are the similarities, and what are the 
diﬀ erences? 
 The most obvious similarity is that both Virgin Atlan-
tic and Ryanair operate in the UK passenger air transport 
industry. Virgin’s air transport business was founded by 
Richard Branson in 1984 58 and Michael O’Leary took over 
as chief executive at Ryanair, a small Irish airline, in 1985. 59 
Both started life in competition with major national ﬂ ag-
carrier airlines (British Airways and Aer Lingus respectively) 
and grew to be major challengers to these established 
companies. As they grew, their scale of operations brought 
them into competition with a much larger number and 
range of airlines operating from the UK: Branson’s Vir-
gin Atlantic competes with some major intercontinental 
companies such as American Airlines and Qantas; O’Leary 
competes with the likes of Flybe and EasyJet in the short-
haul market. Both Branson, who was born in 1950, and 
O’Leary, who is ten years younger, are individuals with 
strong and distinctive personalities, who have a relentless 
appetite for media presence and who make extensive use 
of themselves in their frequent marketing communica-
tions. They are readily engaged in advertising stunts, often 
appear on the news media in relation to stories about the 
industry, and their faces and personalities are powerfully 
associated with their companies.  
 Charting diﬀ erent courses 
 There are, however, some major diﬀ erences. Firstly, they 
diﬀ er in their choice of markets. Virgin’s air transport 
business originated in the long-haul, mainly transatlan-
tic market, which might be highly proﬁ table but is also 
extremely competitive. As the business grew, oﬀ shoots 
were founded as independent companies – for instance, 
Virgin Australia and the ambitious project for the 
world’s ﬁ rst spaceline, Virgin Galactic, 60 which remains 
live despite the loss of the ﬁ rst vehicle,  Enterprise,  in 
November 2014. Ryanair started as a short-haul carrier

and has remained so, focusing on European destinations 
from a small number of airports in the UK and Eire. Its 
competitive positioning is also very different. Ryanair is 
well known as ‘The Low Cost Airline’; the first thing that 
hits you in its publicity material is the price61 and this 
is very clearly the core of its business strategy. The ‘no 
frills’ approach means just that; even the in-flight food 
is limited to sandwiches and costs extra. Virgin, by con-
trast, attracts passengers by offering a superior experi-
ence and is firmly positioned at the quality end of the 
market. Publicity material emphasises style and comfort 
but with a touch of humour,62 and there is a range of 
in-flight extras which, even at the economy end of the 
price range, includes a full meal and drinks service and a 
range of entertainment including e-books.
As was noted, both men love publicity stunts and 
often use humour in their public communications. Bran-
son is usually smiling and in poses that indicate fun and 
a desire to show close links with his staff and popular-
ity with employees, customers and the public in general. 
O’Leary is much more likely to be acerbic, critical and 
uses what might euphemistically be called ‘colourful’ lan-
guage in his public statements. He seems to care little 
about public opinion of him as an individual, and has 
been in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authori-
ties in the UK and Eire on more than one occasion. The 
appointment of Kenny Jacobs to head the company’s 
first television advertising campaign in 2013, however, 
set Ryanair on a slightly different course. While still high-
lighting its low prices, the new (and cheaply shot) adver-
tising campaign heralded the introduction of allocated 
seating, an additional carry-on bag and a slicker booking 
website. These moves, along with the cancellation of its 
annual ‘girlie’ calendar, suggested the company was aim-
ing for a family market; and the continued rise in profits 
during 201463 showed that being ‘nice’ could indeed pay 
off.64
The brand values are also very different. Virgin, as a 
collection of businesses, does everything from running 
trains to selling wine via mobile phones and financial 
services. All these enterprises are linked by the single 
powerful central image of the founder and the charac-
teristic red livery. Ryanair does one thing and one thing 
only, but in doing so sets an almost buccaneering tone, 
readily taking on authorities such as the British Airports 
Authority over its charging practices (characteristically 
direct, O’Leary observed that ‘people have to pay £10 for 
the privilege of getting on and off this rain-sodden and 
weather-beaten island’)65 and European Union bureau-
crats, for instance in a spectacularly damning account 
of EU competition policy in a speech at the EU’s own 
Innovation Convention on 6 December 2011.66 Branson 
has certainly had his conflicts with British Airways, nota-
bly over the ‘dirty tricks’ affair of the early 1990s, but is 
not likely to challenge governments. Virgin tries hard to 
build customer loyalty and gain repeat business through 
brand-related service values; Ryanair’s repeat business 
(and for some customers the Ryanair experience is one 
that inspires the thought ‘never again’) is on price, not 
loyalty to the brand. These differences have a significant 
effect on the nature of employment relations and the 
psychological contract between the two companies and 
their employees.
Working for Richard and Michael
The brand image and the treatment of customers by 
each company have a bearing on the nature of organi-
sational relationship with staff, and vice versa. Aspects 
of organisational behaviour therefore show through in a 
variety of interconnected ways to create consistent and 
very different cultures.
At Virgin Atlantic, cabin crew are there to be help-
ful and welcoming; they are important projectors of 
the brand image and their job is partly to encourage 
the all-important customer loyalty that generates con-
tinuing profit. The importance of staff as carriers of 
company values is clearly reflected in the recruitment 
material and other statements about the nature of 
work at Virgin Atlantic.
Virgin Atlantic brings together all manner of people 
in all manner of roles, all playing a crucial role in 
the smooth running of a very complex operation. But 
whoever you are and wherever you join us, you’ll never 
stop thinking of our customers and what we can do for 
them. From frontline cabin crew to IT analysts, everyone 
here plays a role in delivering the Virgin brand. That 
means using initiative, taking responsibility for your 
actions and being ready to support those around you at 
all times. Similarly, you’ll play your part in maintaining 
the friendly, unconventional professionalism that 
makes Virgin Atlantic such a unique place of work.67
The recruitment process is lengthy and includes a group 
interview that acts as a filter for further tests before job 
offers are made. Training programmes for cabin crew 
and other staff are run from a dedicated training centre, 
and there is a wide range of benefits for full-time staff 
including seven free flights a year, private pensions and 
medical schemes and discounted goods and services 
across the Virgin group.
At Ryanair, the cabin crew start by working for a sup-
plier organisation called Crewlink. You can discover if 
you qualify to apply for a job by answering a series of ten 
online questions. Successful applicants for cabin crew 

31
Chapter 1  Understanding organisational behaviour
posts are trained at Crewlink’s Hahn centre in Germany, 
and are expected to pay an upfront charge of €2,349 for 
the six-week course; or it can be offset against the ini-
tial year’s salary at a total cost of €2,949. In either case, 
accommodation during the course is a further €700. 
Successful graduates get a three-year contract with 
Crewlink to work on Ryanair flights on a shift work basis 
and are not expected to have to make overnight stops 
at its destinations. Post-tax starting salary is said to be 
‘competitive’, with experienced supervisory staff able to 
earn up to €30,000 pa. Staff must be flexible in terms of 
their work location across the thirty plus European cen-
tres, and Crewlink does not guarantee work if individuals 
specify a preferred work location.68
By comparison with long haul, a short-haul operation 
involves very tight turnaround times and Ryanair aims 
for twenty minutes. New aircraft have been commis-
sioned with non-reclining seats that do not have maga-
zine pockets (the required passenger safety instructions 
are fixed to seat backs), facilitating cleaning and cutting 
time on the ground. This creates a very different pace 
and set of pressures on the workforce compared with 
those at Virgin, which is likely to have higher staffing 
levels and to give crew longer rest breaks in the destina-
tion locations between flights. The nature of customer 
relations, by contrast, might be more demanding at Vir-
gin than at Ryanair; staff and customers are together for 
longer and the brand image must be maintained.
Complaints and horror stories can be found about 
work at both organisations; however, Ryanair is sub-
ject to a more systematic and organised campaign of 
criticism for its employment practices by trade union 
organisations. In past years the International Transport 
Workers’ Federation ran a major campaign on its web-
site, the purpose of which was to pressurise the manage-
ment at Ryanair into accepting the role of trade unions 
in representing the workforce – to no avail.
Both organisations have been successful. Ryanair 
continues to turn in significant profits in a sector that 
is prone to disruption and is holding its own during 
recession.69 Virgin, unusually, suffered annual losses in 
2012 and 2013, partly because of increased fuel costs, 
but has embarked on a two-year recovery programme 
and seems on course to return to profitability in 2015.70 
But the cultures and values that get them off the ground 
could hardly be more different.
 Tasks
	 1	 Some writers, such as Morgan, use metaphors to help us understand the nature of organisational 
behaviour. Identify one of Morgan’s metaphors that you think might be applied appropriately to Virgin and 
one to Ryanair, and then develop two of your own, one for each organisation. How would you explain your 
choices?
	 2	 Critically evaluate both organisations in terms of either social exchange theory or the notion of the 
psychological contract given in the chapter.
	 3	 Identify the different demands that might be made of managers to achieve organisational effectiveness 
in each business (you could use Figure 1.6 as a framework). What are the implications for the role and 
development of managers in each case?
	 4	 Ryanair has recently considered entering the transatlantic market, and Virgin set up ‘Little Red’, which 
operates short-haul domestic flights in the UK. What might be the implication of these changes for the 
management of cabin staff in each company?

 organisational behaviour is a discursive subject and much has been 
written about it. the study of organisations, their structure and 
management has therefore to proceed on a broad front. the comparative 
analysis of diff erent approaches will yield benefi ts to the manager. 
identifi cation of major trends in management and organisational theory, 
and the work of leading writers, provide a perspective on concepts and 
ideas discussed in more detail in other chapters.

Chapter 2 ApproAches to orgAnisAtion And MAnAgeMent
 Developments in management 
and organisational behaviour 
 A central part of the study of organisational behaviour is the development of management 
thinking and what might be termed management theory.  (See also  Chapter  1 .) Managers read-
ing the work of leading writers on the subject might see in their thoughts, ideas and conclu-
sions a message about how they should behave. This will infl uence their attitudes towards 
management practice and bring about change in behaviour. 
 Writing on organisation and management, in some form or another, can be traced back 
thousands of years. 1 Also,  Shafritz makes an interesting observation about the contribution of 
William Shakespeare (1564–1616): 
 While William Shakespeare’s contribution to literature and the development of the English 
language have long been acknowledged and thoroughly documented, his contribution to 
the theory of management and administration have been all but ignored. This is a surprising 
oversight when you consider that many of his plays deal with issues of personnel manage-
ment and organizational behavior. 2 
 However, the systematic development of management thinking is viewed, generally, as dating 
from the end of the nineteenth century with the emergence of large industrial organisations 
and the ensuing problems associated with their structure and management. 3 
 Importance of management theory 
 The study of management theory is important for the following reasons: 
 ●  It helps to view the interrelationships between the development of theory, behaviour in 
organisations and management practice. 
 ●  An understanding of the development of management thinking helps in understanding 
principles underlying the actual process of management and reasons for the attention given 
to main topic areas. 
 ●  Management theories are interpretive and evolve in line with changes in the organisational 
environment. 
 ●  Many of the earlier ideas are of continuing importance to the manager and later ideas on 
management tend to incorporate earlier ideas and conclusions. 
 However, if action is to be eff ective, the theory must be adequate and appropriate to the task 
and to improved organisational performance. It must be a ‘good’ theory. To be of any help to 
the practising manager, theory has to be appropriate. For example,  Lee refers to: 
   the danger of adopting theories because they are teachable, rather than because they are 
eff ective . . . [however,] without appropriate theory, there would be very little communica-
tion of the insights of scientifi c theory to practising managers. 4 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 criticism of the study of theory or history of management is misjudged. More attention to the ideas of leading 
writers, and to evolutions in management and organisational behaviour, would help improve understanding and 
performance. 
 How would YOU attempt to defend this assertion to a group of sceptical managers? What benefi ts do YOU expect to 
gain from a study of management theory? 

Part 1  The organisational setting
36
Crainer points out that although management is active, not theoretical, it is nothing without 
ideas.
Nothing is so practical as a good theory. Ideas drive management as surely as the immediate 
problems which land on managers’ desks or which arrive via their e-mail. Decisions have to 
be based on ideas as well as instinct. Without ideas managers flit desperately from crisis to 
crisis. They cannot know where they are going, why they are doing something or what they 
will achieve, without the vital fuel of ideas.5
Framework of analysis
In order to help identify the main trends in the development of organisational behaviour 
and management theory, it is helpful to categorise the ideas and work of writers into various 
‘approaches’, based on their views of organisations, their structure and management.
Management theory is a complex area of study in which it is possible to identify a large 
number of writers and a wide range of comparative and/or conflicting points of view.
There are, therefore, many ways of categorising the various approaches. For example, Skip-
ton attempts a classification of eleven main schools of management theory.6 Whatever form of 
categorisation is adopted, it is possible to identify a number of other approaches, or at least 
sub-divisions of approaches, and cross-grouping among the various approaches. The choice 
of a particular categorisation is therefore largely at the discretion of the observer and the 
demands of the reader.
For convenience, the following analysis revolves around a framework based on four main 
approaches, shown in Figure 2.1. Although a simplistic process, it provides a useful frame-
work in which to direct study and focus attention on the progression of ideas concerned with 
improving organisational performance:
● classical – including scientific management and bureaucracy;
● human relations – including neo-human relations;
● systems;
● contingency.
Attention is also drawn to other ‘approaches’ or ideas, including technology, decision-mak-
ing, social action and postmodernism. See Figure 2.3 below.
Figure 2.1  Main approaches to organisation, structure and management

37
Chapter 2 ApproAches to orgAnisAtion And MAnAgeMent
 The classical approach 
 The  classical writers thought of the organisation in terms of its purpose and formal structure. 
Emphasis is on planning of work, technical requirements of the organisation, principles of 
management, and the assumption of rational and logical behaviour. The analysis of organisa-
tion in this manner is associated with work carried out initially in the early part of the last 
century, by such writers as Taylor, Fayol, Urwick and Brech. Such writers were laying the foun-
dation for a comprehensive theory of management. 
 A clear understanding of the purpose of an organisation is seen as essential to understand-
ing how the organisation works and how its methods of working can be improved. Identifi ca-
tion of general objectives would lead to the clarifi cation of purpose and responsibilities at all 
levels of the organisation and to the most eff ective structure. Attention is given to division of 
work, clear defi nition of duties and responsibilities, and maintaining specialisation and co- 
ordination. Emphasis is on a hierarchy of management and formal organisational relationships. 
 Sets of principles 
 The classical writers (also variously known as the formal or scientifi c management writers – 
although scientifi c management is really only a part of the  classical approach ) were concerned 
with improving the organisation structure as a means of increasing effi  ciency. They empha-
sised the importance of principles for the design of a logical structure of organisation. Their 
writings were in a normative style and they saw these principles as a set of ‘rules’ off ering gen-
eral solutions to common problems of organisation and management. Most classical writers 
had their own set of principles but among the most publicised are those of  Fayol and  Urwick. 
 Fayol identifi ed fi ve managerial activities: planning, organising, command, co-ordination 
and control, together with a set of principles of management. Fayol recognised that there was 
no limit to the principles of management but in his writing advocated fourteen 7  (as discussed 
in  Chapter  10 ). 
 Urwick originally specifi ed eight principles of the requirements of the formal organisation, 
but these were revised to ten in his later writing. 8 
 Brech attempts to provide a practical approach to organisation structure based on tried 
general principles as opposed to concentration on specifi c cases or complex generalisations 
of little value to the practising manager. He sets out the various functions in the organisation 
and the defi nition of formal organisational relationships. 9  Although clearly a strong supporter 
of the formal approach in some of his views such as, for example, on the principle of span of 
control, Brech is less defi nite than other classical writers and recognises a degree of fl exibility 
according to the particular situation. 
 Brech does place great emphasis, however, on the need for the written defi nition of respon-
sibilities and the value of job descriptions as an aid to eff ective organisation and delegation. 
This work builds on the ideas of earlier writers, such as Urwick, and therefore provides a com-
prehensive view of the classical approach to organisation and management. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 it is often claimed that what leading writers say is an important part of the study of management and organisational 
behaviour. others say these different ideas are too abstract, are little more than short-term fads and have little prac-
tical value. 
 What do YOU think? To what extent do YOU expect to learn about the realities of management and organisational 
behaviour from the work of leading writers? 

part 1 the orgAnisAtionAL setting
38
 Evaluation of the classical approach 
 The classical writers have been criticised generally for not taking suffi  cient account of social 
factors and for creating an organisation structure in which people can exercise only limited 
control over their work environment. The idea of sets of principles to guide managerial action 
has also been subject to much criticism. For example,  Simon writes: 
   Organisational design is not unlike architectural design. It involves creating large, complex 
systems having multiple goals. It is illusory to suppose that good designs can be created by 
using the so-called principles of classical organisation theory. 10 
 Research studies have also expressed doubt about the eff ectiveness of these principles when 
applied in practice. 11 
 However, the classical approach prompted the start of a more systematic view of manage-
ment and attempted to provide some common principles applicable to all organisations. These 
principles are still of relevance in that they off er a useful starting point in attempting to ana-
lyse the eff ectiveness of the design of organisation structure. However, the application of these 
principles must take full account of the particular situational variables of each individual 
organisation and the psychological and social factors relating to members of the organisation. 
 Major sub-groupings 
 Two major ‘sub-groupings’ of the classical approach are  scientifi c management and bureaucracy. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Whatever the nature of modern organisations, attention must still be given to essential principles of effective struc-
ture and management. Any criticism should be directed not at the need for such principles but at the manner in 
which they are implemented by managers. 
 What is YOUR view? How effectively are the principles of structure and management applied in YOUR university or 
organisation? 
 Scientifi c management 
 Many of the classical writers were concerned with the improvement of management as a 
means of increasing productivity. Emphasis was on the problem of obtaining increased pro-
ductivity from individual workers through the technical structuring of the work organisa-
tion and the provision of monetary incentives as the motivator for higher levels of output. 
A major contributor to this approach was  F. W. Taylor (1856–1917), the ‘father’ of scientifi c 
management. 12 Taylor believed that in the same way that there is a best machine for each job, 
so there is a best working method by which people should undertake their jobs. All work 
processes could be analysed into discrete tasks and that by scientifi c method it was possible to 
fi nd the ‘one best way’ to perform each task. Each job was broken down into component parts, 
each part timed and the parts rearranged into the most effi  cient method of working. 
 Principles to guide management 
 Taylor was concerned with fi nding more effi  cient methods and procedures for co-ordination 
and control of work, and a believer in the rational–economic needs concept of motivation. 
If management acted on his ideas, work would become more satisfying and profi table for 

39
Chapter 2  Approaches to organisation and management
all concerned. Workers would be motivated by obtaining the highest possible wages through 
working in the most efficient and productive way. He set out a number of principles to guide 
management. These principles are usually summarised as:
● the development of a true science for each person’s work;
● the scientific selection, training and development of workers;
● co-operation with workers to ensure work is carried out in the prescribed way;
● hierarchical structures of authority and close supervision;
● clear division of tasks and responsibility between management and workers.
In his famous studies at the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Taylor applied his ideas on scientific 
management to a group of seventy-five men loading pig iron. Taylor selected a Dutch labourer, 
Schmidt, whom he reported as a ‘high-priced’ man with a reputation for placing a high value 
on money, and of limited mental ability. By following detailed instructions on when to pick up 
the pig iron and walk, and when to sit and rest, and with no back talk, Schmidt increased his 
output from 12½ tons to 47½ tons per day. He maintained this level of output throughout the 
three years of the study. In return Schmidt received a 60 per cent increase in wages compared 
with what was paid to the other men. One by one other workers were selected and trained to 
handle pig iron at the rate of 47½ tons per day and in return they received 60 per cent more 
wages. Taylor drew attention to the need for the scientific selection of the workers. When the 
other labourers in the group were trained in the same method, only one in eight was physically 
capable of the effort of loading 47½ tons per day, although there was a noticeable increase in 
their level of output.
Reactions against scientific management
There were strong criticisms of, and reaction against, scientific management methods from the 
workers who found the work boring and requiring little skill. Despite these criticisms, Taylor 
attempted to expand the implementation of his ideas in the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. 
However, fears of mass redundancies persuaded the management to request Taylor to moder-
ate his activities. Yet Taylor’s belief in his methods was so strong that he would not accept 
management’s interference and eventually they dispensed with his services. Continued resent-
ment and hostility against scientific management led to an investigation of Taylor’s methods 
by a House of Representatives Committee, which reported in 1912. The conclusion of the 
committee was that scientific management did provide some useful techniques and offered 
valuable organisational suggestions, but gave production managers a dangerously high level 
of uncontrolled power.
Taylorism as management control
Taylor placed emphasis on the content of a ‘fair day’s work’ and optimising the level of work-
ers’ productivity. A major obstacle to this objective was ‘systematic soldiering’ and what 
Taylor saw as the deliberate attempt by workers to promote their best interests and to keep 
employers ignorant of how fast work, especially piece-rate work, could be carried out.
According to Braverman, scientific management starts from the capitalist point of view and 
method of production, and the adaptation of labour to the needs of capital. Taylor’s work was 
more concerned with the organisation of labour than with the development of technology. A 
distinctive feature of Taylor’s thought was the concept of management control.13 Braverman 
suggests Taylor’s conclusion was that workers should be controlled not only by the giving of 
orders and maintenance of discipline, but also by removing from them any decisions about the 
manner in which their work was to be carried out. By division of labour, and by dictating precise 
stages and methods for every aspect of work performance, management could gain control of 
the actual process of work. The rationalisation of production processes and division of labour 
tends to result in the de-skilling of work and this may be a main strategy of the employer.14

Cloke and Goldsmith also suggest that Taylor was the leading promoter of the idea that 
managers should design and control the work process scientifically in order to guarantee max-
imum efficiency. He believed in multiple layers of management to supervise the work process 
and in rigid, detailed control of the workforce.
Taylor’s theories justified managerial control over the production process and removed 
decision making from employees and from owners as well. The increasingly authoritative 
operational role of management diminished the direct involvement of owners in day-to-day 
decision making. Managers saw this as an opportunity to solidify their power and adopted 
Taylor’s ideas wholesale. In the process, they affirmed efficiency over collaboration, quantity 
over quality, and cost controls over customer service.15
Relevance of scientific management
Taylor’s work is often criticised today, but it should be remembered that he was writing at a 
time of industrial reorganisation and the emergence of large, complex organisations with new 
forms of technology. He believed his methods would lead to improved management–labour rela-
tions and contribute to improved industrial efficiency and prosperity. Workers were regarded as 
rational–economic, motivated directly by monetary incentives linked to the level of work output.
Among the criticisms are those by Rose. Taylor regarded workers from an engineering 
viewpoint and as machines, but the one best way of performing a task is not always the best 
method for every worker. The reduction of physical movement to find the one best way is not 
always beneficial and some ‘wasteful’ movements are essential to the overall rhythm of work. 
Rose also argues that the concept of a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work is not purely a techni-
cal matter. It is also a notion of social equity and not in keeping with a scientific approach.16
According to Drucker, however, the central theme of Taylor’s work was not inefficiency but 
the need to substitute industrial warfare with industrial harmony. Taylor sought to do this 
through:
● higher wages from increased output;
● the removal of physical strain from doing work the wrong way;
● development of the workers and the opportunity for them to undertake tasks they were 
capable of doing; and
● elimination of the ‘boss’ and the duty of management to help workers.
Frederick Winslow Taylor may prove a more useful prophet for our times than we yet rec-
ognize . . . Taylor’s greatest impact may still be ahead . . . the under-developed and 
developing countries are now reaching the stage where they need Taylor and ‘scientific man-
agement’ . . . But the need to study Taylor anew and apply him may be the greatest in the 
developed countries.17
Impetus to management thinking
Whatever the opinions on scientific management, Taylor and his disciples left to modern man-
agement the legacy of such practices as work study, organisation and methods, payment by 
results, management by exception and production control.
Taylor did give a major impetus to the development of management thinking and the 
later development of organisational behaviour. For example, Crainer and Dearlove suggest 
that although Taylor’s theories are now largely outdated, they still had a profound impact 
throughout the world and his mark can be seen on much of the subsequent management 
literature.18And Stern goes a stage further:
The ‘scientific management’ of Frederick Taylor . . . shaped the first coherent school of 
thought with application to the industrialised world. He was our first professional guru and 
Taylorism – with its twin goals of productivity and efficiency – still influences management 
thinking 100 years on.19

41
Chapter 2 ApproAches to orgAnisAtion And MAnAgeMent
 Principles of Taylor’s scientifi c approach to management appear still to have relevance today. 
We can see examples of Taylorism alive and well, and management practices based on the 
philosophy of his ideas. As an example, large hotel organisations often make use of standard 
recipes and standard performance manuals, and it is common for housekeeping staff  to have a 
prescribed layout for each room, with training based on detailed procedures and the one best 
way. Staff  may be expected to clean a given number of rooms per shift, with fi nancial incentives 
for additional rooms. 20 
 Modern customer call centres can also be seen to exhibit many features of Taylorism.  21 
The strict routine, uniformity, clearly specifi ed tasks, detailed checklists and close control in 
fast food restaurants such as McDonald’s also suggest close links with scientifi c management. 
 It is diffi  cult to argue against the general line of Taylor’s principles but they are subject to 
misuse. What is important is the context and manner in which such principles are put into 
eff ect. There is arguably one best way  technically to perform a job – for example, with fac-
tory assembly line production in particular. However, account needs to be taken of human 
behaviour. People tend to have their preferred way of working and the need for variety and 
more interesting or challenging tasks. Provided work is carried out safely and to a satisfac-
tory standard and completed on time, to what extent should management  insist on the ‘one 
best way’? 
 It seems that Taylor did not so much ignore (as is often suggested) but was more  unaware 
of the complexity of human behaviour in organisations and the importance of the individu-
al’s feelings and sentiments, group working, managerial behaviour and the work environment. 
However, we now have greater knowledge about social eff ects within the work organisation 
and about the value of money, incentives, motivation, and job satisfaction and performance. 
 Bureaucracy 
 A form of structure to be found in many large-scale organisations is  bureaucracy .  Weber, a 
German sociologist, showed particular concern for what he called ‘bureaucratic structures’, 
although his work in this area came almost as a side issue to his main study on power and 
authority. 22 He suggested that ‘the decisive reason for the advance of bureaucratic organization 
has always been its purely technical superiority over any other form of organization’. Weber 
pointed out that the defi nition of tasks and responsibilities within the structure of manage-
ment gave rise to a permanent administration and standardisation of work procedures, not-
withstanding changes in the actual holders of offi  ce. 
 The term ‘bureaucracy’ has common connotations with criticism of red tape and rigidity, 
though in the study of organisations and management it is important that the term is seen 
not necessarily in a depreciative sense but as applying to certain structural features of formal 
organisations. Weber analysed bureaucracies not empirically but as an ‘ideal type’ derived 
from the most characteristic bureaucratic features of all known organisations. He saw the 
development of bureaucracies as a means of introducing order and rationality into social life. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 despite strong criticisms of scientific management, in the right circumstances the underlying concepts still have 
relevance and much to offer work organisations today. it is just that many commentators appear reluctant to admit 
this openly. 
 What do YOU think? Where do YOU think scientific management could be applied to the best overall effect in YOUR 
university or organisation? 

Part 1  The organisational setting
42
Main characteristics of bureaucracies
Weber did not actually define bureaucracy but did attempt to identify the main characteristics 
of this type of organisation. He emphasised the importance of administration based on exper-
tise (rules of experts) and administration based on discipline (rules of officials).
● The tasks of the organisation are allocated as official duties among the various positions.
● There is an implied clear-cut division of labour and a high level of specialisation.
● A hierarchical authority applies to the organisation of offices and positions.
● Uniformity of decisions and actions is achieved through formally established systems of 
rules and regulations. Together with a structure of authority, this enables the co-ordination 
of various activities within the organisation.
● An impersonal orientation is expected from officials in their dealings with clients and other 
officials. This is designed to result in rational judgements by officials in the performance of 
their duties.
● Employment by the organisation is based on technical qualifications and constitutes a life-
long career for the officials.23
The four main features of bureaucracy are summarised by Stewart as specialisation, hierarchy 
of authority, system of rules and impersonality. Stewart sees the characteristic of impersonal-
ity as the feature of bureaucracy that most distinguishes it from other types of organisations. 
A bureaucracy should not only be impersonal but be seen to be impersonal.24
Robbins and Judge emphasise standardisation as the key concept that underlies all 
bureaucracies.
The bureaucracy is characterized by highly routine operating tasks achieved through spe-
cialization, very formalized rules and regulations, tasks that are grouped into functional 
departments, centralized authority, narrow spans of control, and decision making that fol-
lows the chain of command  .  .  .  However, it does have its advantages. The primary 
strength of the bureaucracy lies in its ability to perform standardized activities in a highly 
efficient manner.25
Criticisms of bureaucracy
Weber’s concept of bureaucracy has a number of disadvantages and has been subject to severe 
criticism:
● The over-emphasis on rules and procedures, record keeping and paperwork may become 
more important in its own right than as a means to an end.
● Officials may develop a dependence upon bureaucratic status, symbols and rules.
● Initiative may be stifled, and when a situation is not covered by a complete set of rules or 
procedures there may be a lack of flexibility or adaptation to changing circumstances.
● Position and responsibilities in the organisation can lead to officious bureaucratic behav-
iour. There may also be a tendency to conceal administrative procedures from outsiders.
● Impersonal relations can lead to stereotyped behaviour and a lack of responsiveness to indi-
vidual incidents or problems.
Restriction of psychological growth
One of the strongest critics of bureaucratic organisation, and the demands it makes on 
the worker, is Argyris.26 He claims that bureaucracies restrict the psychological growth of the 
individual and cause feelings of failure, frustration and conflict. Argyris suggests that the 
organisational environment should provide a significant degree of individual responsibility 
and self-control, commitment to the goals of the organisation, productiveness, and work and 
an opportunity for individuals to apply their full abilities.

43
Chapter 2 ApproAches to orgAnisAtion And MAnAgeMent
 A similar criticism is made by  Caulkin, who refers to the impersonal structure of bureau-
cracy as constructed round the post rather than the person and the ease with which it can be 
swung behind unsocial or even pathological ends. 
   The overemphasis on process rather than purpose, fragmented responsibilities and hierarchi-
cal control means that it’s all too easy for individuals to neglect the larger purposes to which 
their small eff ort is being put. 27 
 A number of writers refer to ‘adhocracy’ as the opposite of bureaucracy.  Adhocracy is a fl ex-
ible, loosely structured, adaptable, organic and informal form of organisation. According to 
 Morgan, adhocracy is an organic form of organisation, highly suited for the performance of 
complex and uncertain tasks. It is frequently used for research and development. 28  Waterman 
sees adhocracy as any form of organisation that cuts across normal bureaucratic lines to cap-
ture opportunities, solve problems and get results. 29  Mintzberg views adhocracy as the project 
organisations build around project teams of experts, with senior managers linking and deal-
ing to secure the projects. 30 
 Evaluation of bureaucracy 
 Growth of bureaucracy has come through the increasing size and complexity of organisa-
tions and associated demand for eff ective administration. Eff ective organisation is based on 
structure and delegation through diff erent layers of the hierarchy. The work of the classical 
writers has given emphasis to the careful design and planning of organisation structure and 
the defi nition of individual duties and responsibilities. Greater specialisation and the applica-
tion of expertise and technical knowledge have highlighted the need for laid-down procedures. 
 Bureaucracy is founded on a formal, clearly defi ned and hierarchical structure. However, 
with rapid changes in the external environment, de-layering of organisations, empowerment 
and greater attention to meeting the needs of customers, there is an increasing need to organ-
ise for fl exibility. For example, the crisis IBM experienced in the 1980s/1990s over the market 
for personal computers is explained at least in part by its top-heavy corporate structure, cum-
bersome organisation and dinosaur-like bureaucracy. 31 
 According to  Cloke and Goldsmith, management and bureaucracy can be thought of as 
fl ip sides of the same coin. The elements of bureaucracy generate organisational hierarchy and 
management, while managers generate a need for bureaucracy. 
   Bureaucracies provide a safe haven where managers can hide from responsibility and avoid 
being held accountable for errors of judgement or problems they created or failed to solve. 
In return, managers are able to use bureaucratic rules to stifl e self-management and compel 
employees to follow their direction . . . Yet bureaucratic systems can be broken down and 
transformed into human-scale interactions. We have seen countless managers recreate them-
selves as leaders and facilitators, employees reinvent themselves as responsible self-managing 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 it is difficult to envisage how large-scale organisations, especially within the public sector, could function effectively 
without exhibiting at least some of the features of a bureaucracy. demands for alternative forms of structure are 
unrealistic. 
 How would YOU attempt to justify the benefits of bureaucratic structures? To what extent would YOU be comfortable 
working in a bureaucratic organisation?

team members, and bureaucracies transform into responsive, human-scale organizations. 
Alternatives to organizational hierarchy are both practical and possible.32
By their very nature, bureaucracies have always tended to attract criticism. Much of this 
criticism is valid, but much also appears unfair. For example, according to Drucker:
Whenever a big organization gets into trouble – and especially if it has been successful for 
many years – people blame sluggishness, complacency, arrogance, mammoth bureaucracies. 
A plausible explanation? Yes. But rarely the relevant or correct one.33
Need for alternative structures
As organisations face increasing global competitiveness and complex demands of the informa-
tion and technological age, the need arises for alternative forms of corporate structure and 
systems. For example, there appears to be a particular dilemma for management in personal 
service industries. The underlying characteristics of bureaucracy would seem to restrict per-
sonal service delivery, which requires a flexible approach, responsiveness to individual require-
ments and the need for initiative and inventiveness.34
Ridderstråle points out that in the past century the hallmark of a large company was hier-
archy, which rests on principles at odds with the new strategic requirements. ‘Bureaucracies 
allowed people with knowledge to control ignorant workers. Now, new structures are needed 
as knowledge spreads.’ Ridderstråle suggests four specific ways in which high-performing 
organisations have responded to increasingly complex knowledge systems by developing 
organisational solutions that depart from the traditional bureaucratic model:
● more decentralised and flatter structures in order that quick decisions can be taken near to 
where the critical knowledge resides;
● the use of more than a single structure in order that knowledge may be assembled across the 
boundaries of a traditional organisation chart;
● converting companies into learning organisations and giving every employee the same level 
of familiarity with personnel and capabilities;
● broader sharing of expertise and knowledge, which may be located in the periphery where 
little formal authority resides.35
Stewart suggests that more organisations today contain mainly, or a considerable number 
of, professionals. Such organisations will still have bureaucratic features, but there is more 
reliance on professional discretion and self-regulation than on control through rules and 
regulations.36
Public-sector organisations
However, despite new forms of organisation that have emerged, many writers suggest that 
bureaucracy is still relevant today as a major form of organisation structure.37 In the case of 
public-sector organisations, in particular, there is a demand for uniformity of treatment, regu-
larity of procedures and public accountability for their operations. This leads to adherence to 
specified rules and procedures and to the keeping of detailed records. In their actual dealings 
with public-sector organisations, people often call for what amounts to increased bureaucracy, 
even though they may not use that term. The demands for equal treatment, for a standard set 
of regulations that applies to everyone and that decisions should not be left to the discretion of 
individual managers are, in effect, demands for bureaucracy.
Green argues that, although bureaucracies are becoming less and less the first-choice for-
mat for organisational shape, there is still a place for bureaucracy in parts of most organisa-
tions and especially public-sector organisations such as local authorities and universities. The 
use and implementation of tried and tested rules and procedures helps to ensure essential val-
ues and ethics, and that necessary functions are run on a consistent and fair basis.38 New forms 
of information technology, such as electronic transactions processed from home or public 

45
Chapter 2  Approaches to organisation and management
access terminals, are likely to change processes of government service delivery, administrative 
workloads and the nature of bureaucracy.39
Human relations approach
The main emphasis of the classical writers was on structure and the formal organisation, but 
during the 1920s greater attention began to be paid to the social factors at work and to the 
behaviour of employees within an organisation – that is, the human relations approach.
The Hawthorne studies
The turning point in the development of the human relations movement (‘behavioural’ and 
‘informal’ are alternative headings) came with the famous studies at the Hawthorne plant of 
the Western Electric Company near Chicago (1924–32) and the subsequent publication of 
the research findings.40 Among the people who wrote about the Hawthorne studies was Elton 
Mayo (1880–1949), who is often quoted as having been a leader of the researchers. However, 
there appears to be some doubt as to the extent of Mayo’s actual involvement.41
There were four main phases to the Hawthorne studies:
● the illumination experiments;
● the relay assembly test room;
● the interviewing programme;
● the bank wiring observation room.
Illumination experiments
The original investigation was conducted on the lines of the classical approach and was con-
cerned, in typical scientific management style, with the effects of the intensity of lighting 
upon the workers’ productivity. The workers were divided into two groups, an experimental 
group and a control group. The results of these tests were inconclusive as production in the 
experimental group varied with no apparent relationship to the level of lighting, but actually 
increased when conditions were made much worse. Production also increased in the control 
group although the lighting remained unchanged. The level of production was influenced, 
clearly, by factors other than changes in physical conditions of work. This prompted a series 
of other experiments investigating factors of worker productivity.
Relay assembly test room
In the relay assembly test room the work was boring and repetitive. It involved assembling tele-
phone relays by putting together a number of small parts. Six women workers were transferred 
from their normal departments to a separate area. Researchers selected two assemblers who 
were friends, then chose three other assemblers and a layout operator. The experiment was 
divided into thirteen periods during which the workers were subjected to a series of planned 
and controlled changes to their conditions of work, such as hours of work, rest pauses and 
provision of refreshments. The general environmental conditions of the test room were similar 
to those of the normal assembly line.
During the experiment the observer adopted a friendly manner, consulting the workers, 
listening to their complaints and keeping them informed. Following all but one of the changes 
(when operators complained that too many breaks made them lose their work rhythm) there 
was a continuous increase in the level of production. The researchers formed the conclusion 
that the extra attention given to the workers and the apparent interest in them shown by man-
agement were the main reasons for the higher productivity. This has become famous as the 
‘Hawthorne effect’.

Part 1  The organisational setting
46
Interviewing programme
Another significant phase of the experiments was the interviewing programme. The lighting 
experiment and the relay assembly test room drew attention to the form of supervision as a 
contributory factor to the workers’ level of production. In an attempt to find out more about 
the workers’ feelings towards their supervisors and their general conditions of work, a large 
interviewing programme was introduced. More than 20,000 interviews were conducted before 
the work was ended because of the Depression.
Initially, interviewers approached their task with a set of prepared questions, relating 
mainly to how the workers felt about their jobs. However, this produced only limited infor-
mation. As a result, the style of interviewing was changed to become more non-directive and 
open ended. There was no set list of questions and the workers were free to talk about any 
aspect of their work. The interviewers set out to be friendly and sympathetic. They adopted an 
impartial, non-judgemental approach and concentrated on listening.
Using this approach, interviewers found out far more about workers’ true feelings and atti-
tudes. They gained information not just about supervision and working conditions, but also 
about the company itself, management, work group relations and matters outside of work 
such as family life and views on society in general. Many workers appeared to welcome the 
opportunity to have someone to talk to about their feelings and problems and to be able to ‘let 
off steam’ in a friendly atmosphere. The interviewing programme was significant in giving an 
impetus to present-day human resource management and the use of counselling interviews, 
and highlighting the need for management to listen to workers’ feelings and problems. Being a 
good listener is arguably even more important for managers in today’s work organisations and 
it is a skill that needs to be encouraged and developed.42
Bank wiring observation room
Another experiment involved the observation of a group of fourteen men working in the 
bank wiring room. It was noted that the men formed their own informal organisation with 
sub-groups or cliques, and natural leaders emerging with the consent of the members. The 
group developed its own pattern of informal social relations and ‘norms’ of what constituted 
‘proper’ behaviour. Despite a financial incentive scheme where the workers could receive more 
money the more work produced, the group decided on a level of output well below the level 
they were capable of producing. Group pressures on individual workers were stronger than 
financial incentives offered by management. The workers believed that if they increased their 
output, management would raise the standard level of piece rates. The importance of group 
‘norms’ and informal social relations are discussed later (see Chapter 8).
Evaluation
The Hawthorne studies have received much criticism, for example on methodology and on 
failure of the investigators to take sufficient account of environmental factors – although 
much of this criticism is with the value of hindsight. The human relations writers have been 
criticised generally for the adoption of a management perspective, their ‘unitary frame of ref-
erence’ and their over-simplified theories.43 Other criticisms of the human relations approach 
are that it is insufficiently scientific and that it takes too narrow a view. It ignores the role of 
the organisation itself in how society operates.
Sex power differential
There are a number of interpretations of the results of the Hawthorne studies, includ-
ing the possible implications of the ‘sex power differential’ between the two groups. In 
the bank wiring room, where output was restricted, the group was all male. In the relay 

47
Chapter 2 ApproAches to orgAnisAtion And MAnAgeMent
assembly room, where output increased, all members were young unmarried women. All 
except one were living at home with traditional families of immigrant background. In 
the work environment of the factory, women had been subjected to frequent contact with 
male supervisors and therefore ‘the sex power hierarchies in the home and in the fac-
tory were congruent’. It is suggested, therefore, that it was only to be expected that the 
women agreed readily to participate with management in the relay assembly test room 
experiment. 44  
 Importance of the Hawthorne studies 
 Whatever the interpretation of the Hawthorne studies, they generated signifi cant new ideas 
concerning the importance of work groups and leadership, communications, output restric-
tions, motivation and job design. The studies undoubtedly marked a signifi cant step forward 
in providing further insight into human behaviour at work and the development of manage-
ment thinking. They are regarded as one of the most important of social science investigations 
and the foundation of the human relations approach to management and the development of 
organisational behaviour. 
 Supporters of the classical approach adopted a more managerial perspective and sought to 
increase production by rationalisation of the work organisation. By contrast, the human rela-
tions movement has led to ideas on increasing production by humanising the work organisa-
tion and strove for a greater understanding of people’s psychological and social needs at work 
as well as improving the process of management. 
 Recognition of the informal organisation 
 The human relations approach also recognised the importance of the informal organisa-
tion, which will always be present within the formal structure. This informal organisation 
will infl uence the motivation of employees who will view the organisation for which they 
work through the values and attitudes of their colleagues. Their view of the organisation 
determines their approach to work and the extent of their motivation to work well or 
otherwise. 
 In a review of humane approaches to management,  Crainer asserts: ‘The Hawthorne Stud-
ies were important because they showed that views of how managers behaved were a vital 
aspect of motivation and improved performance. Also, the research revealed the importance 
of informal work groups.’ 45 
 Human relations writers demonstrated that people go to work to satisfy a complexity of 
needs and not simply for monetary reward. These writers emphasised the importance of the 
wider social needs of individuals and gave recognition to the work organisation as a social 
organisation and the importance of the group, and group values and norms, in infl uencing 
individual behaviour at work. It has been commented that the classical school was concerned 
about ‘organisations without people’ and the human relations school about ‘people without 
organisations’. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 the human relations approach makes all the right noises, with an emphasis on humane behaviour, considerate man-
agement and recognition of the informal organisation. however, it is more about what people would like to believe 
and ignores the realities of the actual working environment. 
 What is YOUR opinion? To what extent have YOU experienced a genuine human relations approach in a work 
organisation? 

Part 1  The organisational setting
48
Neo-human relations
Certainly there were shortcomings in the human relations approach, and assumptions that 
evolved from studies such as the Hawthorne studies were not necessarily supported by empiri-
cal evidence. For example, the contention that a satisfied worker is a productive worker was 
not always found to be valid. However, the results of the studies and subsequent attention 
given to the social organisation and to theories of individual motivation gave rise to the work 
of those writers in the 1950s and 1960s who adopted a more psychological orientation. New 
ideas on management theory arose and a major focus of concern was the personal adjustment 
of the individual within the work organisation and the effects of group relationships and lead-
ership styles.
This group of writers is often (and more correctly) categorised separately under the head-
ing of neo-human relations. The works of these writers are examined later in more detail (in 
Chapter 7 and Chapter 10) but summarised briefly here.
Some leading contributors
A major impetus for the neo-human relations approach was the work of Maslow who, in 
1943, put forward a theoretical framework of individual personality development and motiva-
tion based on a hierarchy of five levels of human needs: physiological, safety, love, esteem and 
self-actualisation at the highest level.46 The work of Maslow provides a link with the earlier 
human relations approach.
Among the best-known contributors to the neo-human relations approach are Herzberg 
and McGregor. Herzberg isolated two different sets of factors affecting motivation and satis-
faction at work. One set of factors comprises those that, if absent, cause dissatisfaction, and 
concerned basically the job environment. However, to motivate workers to give of their best, 
proper attention must be given to a different set of factors, the ‘motivators’ or ‘growth’ fac-
tors concerned with job content.47 McGregor argued that the style of management adopted is 
a function of the manager’s attitudes towards human nature and behaviour at work. He put 
forward two suppositions called Theory X and Theory Y, which are based on popular assump-
tions about work and people.48
Other major contributors to the neo-human relations approach are Likert, whose work 
includes research into different systems of management;49 McClelland, with ideas on achieve-
ment motivation;50 and Argyris, who considered the effects of the formal organisation on the 
individual and psychological growth in the process of self-actualisation.51 Argyris’s major con-
tributions include his work on organisational learning and on effective leadership.52
The neo-human relations approach has generated a large amount of writing and research, 
not only from original proposers but also from others seeking to establish the validity of their 
ideas. This has led to continuing attention given to such matters as organisation structur-
ing, group dynamics, job satisfaction, communication and participation, leadership styles and 
motivation. It has also led to greater attention to the importance of interpersonal interactions, 
the causes of conflict and recognition of employee relations.
The systems approach
Criticisms of earlier approaches to organisation are based in part on the attempt to study the 
activities and problems of the organisation solely in terms of the internal environment. The 
classical approach emphasised the technical requirements of the organisation and its needs – 
‘organisations without people’; the human relations approach emphasised the psychological 
and social aspects, and the consideration of human needs – ‘people without organisations’. 
The systems approach attempts to reconcile these two earlier approaches and the work of the 
formal and informal writers.

49
Chapter 2  Approaches to organisation and management
Systems theory is not new and has been used in the natural and physical sciences for a num-
ber of years. One of the founders of this approach was the biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy, 
who used the term ‘systems theory’ in an article published in 1951 and who is generally cred-
ited with having developed the outline of General Systems Theory.53 The systems approach 
to organisation has arisen, at least in part, therefore, from the work of biologists, and Miller 
and Rice have likened the commercial and industrial organisation to the biological organism.54
From a business perspective, organisations are analysed as ‘systems’ with a number of inter-
related sub-systems. Attention is focused on the total work organisation and the interrelation-
ships of structure and behaviour, and the range of variables within the organisation. The idea 
is that any part of an organisation’s activities affects all other parts. The systems approach 
encourages managers to view the organisation both as a whole and as part of a larger environ-
ment. (The view of the organisation as an open system is discussed later in Chapter 3.)
Socio-technical system
The idea of socio-technical systems arose from the work of Trist and others, of the Tavistock 
Institute of Human Relations, in their study of the effects of changing technology in the coal-
mining industry in the 1940s.55 The traditional method of working was small, self-selecting 
groups of miners working together, as an independent team, on one part of the coal face – the 
‘single place’ or ‘shortwall’ method. The increasing use of mechanisation and the introduction 
of coal-cutters and mechanical conveyors enabled coal to be extracted on a ‘longwall’ method. 
Shift working was introduced, with each shift specialising in one stage of the operation – 
preparation, cutting or loading.
However, the new method meant a change in the previous system. Technological change 
had brought about changes in psychological and sociological properties of the old method of 
working. There was a lack of co-operation between different shifts and, within each shift, an 
increase in absenteeism, scapegoating and signs of greater social stress. The ‘longwall’ method 
was socially disruptive and did not prove as economically efficient as it could have been with 
the new technology.
The researchers saw the need for a socio-technical approach in which an appropriate social 
system could be developed in keeping with the new technical system. The result was the ‘com-
posite longwall’ method, with more responsibility to the team as a whole and shifts carrying 
out composite tasks, the reintroduction of multiskilled roles and a reduction in specialisation. 
The composite method was psychologically and socially more rewarding and economically 
more efficient than the ‘longwall’ method.
The socio-technical system is concerned with the interactions between the psychological 
and social factors and the needs and demands of the human part of the organisation, and its 
structural and technological requirements. The ‘socio-technical’ system directs attention to the 
transformation or conversion process itself, to the series of activities through which the organ-
isation attempts to achieve its objectives. Recognition of the socio-technical approach is of 
particular importance today. People must be considered as at least an equal priority along with 
investment in technology. For example, Lane et al. point out that major technological change 
has brought about dramatic changes in worker behaviour and requirements. It is people who 
unlock the benefits and opportunities of information and communications technology.56
Technological determinism
The socio-technical system provides a link between the systems approach and a sub-division, 
sometimes adopted – the technology approach. Writers under the technology heading attempt 
to restrict generalisations about organisations and management and emphasise the effects of 
varying technologies on organisation structure, work groups and individual performance and 
job satisfaction. This is in contrast with the socio-technical approach, which did not regard 
technology, per se, as a determinant of behaviour.

50
 Under the heading of the technology approach could be included the work of such writers 
as:  Walker and Guest (eff ects of the assembly line production method on employee behaviour);  57 
 Sayles (relationship between technology and the nature of work groups); 58  Blauner (problems 
of ‘alienation’ in relation to diff erent work technologies); 59 and  Turner and Lawrence (technol-
ogy and socio-culture) 60 .  (Technology and organisations is examined in  Chapter  12 .)  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 the underlying principles and ideas of the socio-technical systems and technological determinism approaches are of 
particular relevance and assistance to the practical manager. 
 To what extent do YOU agree with this assertion? As a manager, how would YOU envisage drawing upon YOUR 
understanding of these approaches? 
 
 Management and organisational behaviour in action case study 
 ‘Vanguard Method’ for systems thinking 
 A diff erent, more recent approach to thinking on management applied to service organisations is that of the ‘Van-
guard Method’, which is based on the pioneering work of, among others, W. edwards deming, chris Argyris and 
taiichi ohno. ohno, the father of the toyota production system, drew attention to managers’ lack of control on the 
shop fl oor and to the importance of continuous revisions, and his ideas gave rise to concepts such as total quality 
management and just-in-time. ohno viewed the work organisation as an integrated system, with the focus on fl ow 
throughout the system rather than on individual functions. As  Seddon notes: ‘in ohno’s philosophy each person’s 
work is connected to the needs of customers, as opposed to arbitrary and counterproductive measures of activity.’ 61 
 Vanguard helps organisations change from command and control thinking to a systems thinking on the design 
and management of work.

 emphasis is placed on the customer and measurement of success as opposed to targets of expected performance. 
the consequences are improved service to customers, at lower costs and improved morale. service is different to 
manufacturing. in simple terms, there is inherently greater variety in customer demand, hence the need to design 
to absorb that variety. Vanguard recommends that service organisations avoid the ‘tools’ developed for ‘lean manu-
facturing’ as they do not apply well in service organisations. 

51
Chapter 2 ApproAches to orgAnisAtion And MAnAgeMent
 intrinsic to the Vanguard Method is the transfer of expertise to people (managers and staff ) in the organisation. 
Vanguard uses ‘sensei’, people who are experts in both intervention theory (how you make a change) and systems 
theory (how to analyse and design work). Vanguard senseis are experts in the ‘what’ (how a systems design improves 
performance) and the ‘how’ (how to make this change). 
 Steps in the Vanguard Method 
 Understanding the distinctions – top management must understand what it means to change from command and 
control to systems thinking. 
 Scoping –  Assessing the scope for improvement; knowledge about customer demand, revenue and service fl ows, 
waste and the causes of waste; the potential scope and value of making this change in practical terms. 
 Check – people who do the work to be given technical support and check their understanding of the what and why 
of performance as a system. 
 Measures and method –  in parallel with ‘check’, managers work on the relationship between measures and method, 
understanding the need to change and use of measures for managing and improving performance. 
 prototyping – the ‘check’ team and managers work on measures and establish a prototype of the redesign. the 
purpose is to develop the redesign and determine anticipated economies. 
 Leader’s review – in order to make informed choices about benefi ts from adopting the new systems design and 
authorises preparation for implementation. 
 proof of concept – prototype is extended and developed to handle all customer demands; the consequential 
improvements are tracked with new (system) measures while management develop a new budgeting and manage-
ment information system. 
 Constancy of purpose – Leadership of the change with the top management team including, in particular, roles and 
measures. clarity about future state and means of implementation. 
 Implementation – here a choice can be made: establishing a working pilot (a complete redesign but limited in 
volume or scope); or making a complete change to the organisation. 
 Changes to policy and practice –  review matters of policy and practice. typically they will include budgeting, hr 
policy and practice, interpretation of regulations and it. 
 Finding out what matters to your customers –  having redesigned and improved your service, it is a natural exten-
sion to step over the boundary and learn about what matters to your customers. the work leads to new services, 
designed with customers.

 Tasks 
  1.  What is your view on a systems approach and the Vanguard Method? 
  2.  to what extent do you believe systems thinking can be applied eff ectively to production organisations? 
  3.  how do you think managers are likely to react to an ethos of learning through action on the system? What poten-
tial diffi  culties do you see? 
 The contingency approach 
 The classical approach suggested one best form of structure and placed emphasis on general 
sets of principles, while the human relations approach gave little attention at all to struc-
ture. In contrast, the  contingency approach shows renewed concern with the importance of 
structure as a signifi cant infl uence on organisational performance. The contingency approach, 
which can be seen as an extension of the systems approach, highlights possible means of dif-
ferentiating among alternative forms of organisation structures and systems of management. 
There is no one optimum state. For example, the structure of the organisation and its ‘success’ 
are dependent, that is contingent upon, the nature of tasks with which it is designed to deal 
and the nature of environmental infl uences. 

Part 1  The organisational setting
52
The most appropriate structure and system of management is therefore dependent upon 
the contingencies of the situation for each particular organisation. The contingency approach 
implies that organisational theory should not seek to suggest one best way to structure or man-
age organisations, but should provide insights into the situational and contextual ­factors that 
influence management decisions. Situational variables may be identified in a number of ways 
and include type of organisation and its purpose, culture, size, technology and environment. 
Contingency models of organisation and management are discussed later (see Chapter 11).
A summary of management theory and some links with other chapters are set out in the 
concept map in Figure 2.2.
Other approaches to the study  
of organisations
The fourfold framework of classical, human relations, systems and contingency approaches 
provides a helpful, although rather simplistic, categorisation. The study of organisations, their 
structure and management is a broad field of enquiry. Depending on the views and preferences 
of the writer, other possible main approaches include decision-making and social action.
Decision-making approach
The systems approach involves the isolation of those functions most directly concerned with 
the achievement of objectives and the identification of main decision areas or sub-systems. 
Viewing the organisation as a system emphasises the need for good information and chan-
nels of communication in order to assist effective decision-making in the organisation. Rec-
ognition of the need for decision-making and the attainment of goals draws attention to a 
sub-division of the systems approach, or a separate category – that of the decision-making 
(decision theory) approach. Here the focus of attention is on managerial decision-making and 
how organisations process and use information in making decisions.
Successful management lies in responding to internal and external change. This involves the 
clarification of objectives, the specification of problems and the search for and ­implementation 
of solutions. The organisation is seen as an information-processing network with numerous 
decision points. An understanding of how decisions are made helps in understanding behav-
iour in the organisation. Decision-making writers seek to explain the mechanisms by which 
conflict is resolved and choices are made.
Some leading writers
Leading writers on the decision-making approach include Barnard, Simon and Cyert and 
March. The scope of the decision-making approach, however, is wide and it is possible to iden-
tify contributions from engineers, mathematicians and operational research specialists in addi-
tion to the work of economists, psychologists and writers on management and organisation.
Barnard stressed the need for co-operative action in organisations. He believed that people’s 
ability to communicate, and their commitment and contribution to the achievement of a com-
mon purpose, were necessary for the existence of a co-operative system.62 These ideas were 
developed further by Simon. He sees management as meaning decision-making and his concern 
is with how decisions are made and how decision-making can be improved. Simon is critical 
of the implication of ‘man’ as completely rational and proposes a model of ‘administrative 
man’ who, unlike ‘economic man’, ‘satisfices’ rather than maximises. Administrative decision-
making is the achievement of satisfactory rather than optimal results in solving problems.63
Economic models of decision-making, based on the assumption of rational behaviour in 
choosing from known alternatives in order to maximise objectives, can be contrasted with

Part 1  The organisational setting
54
behavioural models based not so much on maximisation of objectives as on short-term expe-
diency, where a choice is made to avoid conflict and to stay within limiting constraints. Manag-
ers are more concerned with avoiding uncertainties than with the prediction of uncertainties.64 
(See also decision models of leadership in Chapter 9.)
Social action
Social action represents a contribution from sociologists to the study of organisations. Social-
action writers attempt to view the organisation from the standpoint of individual members 
(actors) who will each have their own goals and interpretation of their work situation in terms 
of the satisfaction sought and the meaning that work has for them. The goals of the indi-
vidual, and the means selected and actions taken to achieve these goals, are affected by the 
individual’s perception of the situation. Social action looks to the individual’s own definition 
of the situation as a basis for explaining behaviour. Conflict of interests is seen as normal 
behaviour and part of organisational life.
According to Silverman, ‘The action approach . . . does not, in itself, provide a theory of 
organisations. It is instead best understood as a method of analysing social relations within 
organisations.’65
Criticisms of earlier approaches
A main thrust of social action is criticism of earlier approaches to organisation and manage-
ment and of what is claimed to be their failure to provide a satisfactory basis for the expla-
nation or prediction of individual behaviour. The human relations approaches have been 
criticised because of their focus on generalised theories of good management, group psychol-
ogy and the suggestion of needs common to all individuals at work. The technology approach 
has been criticised for attributing feelings of alienation to the nature of technology and the 
status of work groups rather than an analysis that focused on concern for the individual’s 
expectations of, and reactions to, work. The systems approach has been criticised for failure to 
examine the orientation of individual members to the organisation, the different expectations 
people have of their work or ways in which the environment influences expectations of work.
Unitarist or pluralist perspectives
Important contributors to a social action approach include Goldthorpe et al. (industrial atti-
tudes and behaviour patterns of manual workers)66 and Fox. In a research paper written for 
the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers’ Associations (the Donovan Report), 
Fox suggests two major ways of perceiving an industrial organisation – a ‘unitarist’ approach 
and a ‘pluralist’ approach.67 In the search for effective employee relations and a common com-
mitment to the goals of the organisation, consideration should be given to both the unitarist 
and pluralist perspectives. While neither of the approaches can be seen as ‘right’ or ‘wrong’, 
these contrasting views will influence the nature of employment relations and the manage-
ment of human resources. (See the discussion in Chapter 3 on contrasting views of conflict.)
The unitarist perspective
With the unitarist perspective the organisation is viewed as an integrated and harmonious whole, 
with managers and other staff sharing common interests and objectives. There is an image of the 
organisation as a team with a common source of loyalty, one focus of effort and one accepted 
leader. Conflict is perceived as disruptive and unnatural and can be explained by, for example, 
poor communications, personality clashes or the work of agitators. Trade unions are seen as an 
unnecessary evil and restrictive practices as outmoded or caused by trouble-makers.
HR policies and managerial development can be seen as reflecting a unitary ideology. Horwitz 
suggests that the unitary perspective views company and trade union loyalty as mutually 

55
Chapter 2 ApproAches to orgAnisAtion And MAnAgeMent
exclusive. He raises the question of human resource management (HRM) as a reformation of 
a unitarist managerial ideology. Developments in HRM, in seeking to optimise co- operation 
and organisational loyalty, can be seen as imposing new forms of control. A managerial 
approach to facilitating organisational goals and the direct involvement of employees furthers 
a unitary perspective and can mask an underlying distaste for unionism. 68 
 The pluralist perspective 
 An alternative view suggested by  Fox is the  pluralist perspective , which views the organisation 
as made up of powerful and competing sub-groups with their own legitimate loyalties, objec-
tives and leaders. 69 These competing sub-groups are almost certain to come into confl ict. From 
the pluralist perspective, confl ict in organisations is seen as inevitable and induced, in part, 
by the very structure of the organisation. Confl ict is not necessarily a bad thing but can be an 
agent for evolution, and internal and external change. 
 Restrictive practices may be seen as a rational response from a group that regards itself 
as being threatened. The role of the manager would be less commanding and enforcing, and 
more persuading and co-ordinating. Fox suggests that the pluralist perspective is a more real-
istic frame of reference. He argues the importance of viewing work situations through the 
diff erent groups involved rather than attempting a wished-for unitarist approach. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 the study of social action may be popular with academics but too much attention is given to the easy option of 
criticising other approaches. social action theory offers little that is constructive or of positive value to the practical 
manager. 
 What is YOUR view? Can YOU present a counter argument? How much benefit do YOU derive from the study of 
social action? 
 Action theory 
 A theory of human behaviour from an ‘action approach’ is presented by  Bowey. 70 She suggests 
that action theory, systems theory and contingency theory are not necessarily incompatible 
approaches to the understanding of behaviour in organisations. It would be possible to take 
the best parts of the diff erent approaches and combine them into a theory that would model 
empirical behaviour and also facilitate the analysis of large numbers of people in organisations. 
 The three essential principles of action theory can be summarised as below: 
 ●  Sociology is concerned not just with behaviour but with ‘meaningful action’. 
 ●  Particular meanings persist through reaffi  rmation in actions. 
 ●  Actions can also lead to changes in meanings. 
 Bowey suggests these three principles apply mainly to explanations of individual, or small-
scale, behaviour. She gives four additional concepts, taken from systems theory, on which anal-
ysis of large-scale behaviour can be based. These concepts are redefi ned in accordance with an 
action approach. 
 ●  Role – this is needed for the analysis of behaviour in organisations. It explains the similar 
actions of diff erent people in similar situations within the organisation and the expecta-
tions held by other people. 
 ●  Relationships – this is needed to explain the patterns of interaction among people and the 
behaviours displayed towards one another. 

Part 1  The organisational setting
56
● Structure – the relationships among members of an organisation give rise to patterns 
of action that can be identified as a ‘transitory social structure’. The social factors, and 
non-social factors such as payment systems, methods of production and physical layout, 
together form the behavioural structure.
● Process – human behaviour can be analysed in terms of processes, defined as ‘continuous 
interdependent sequences of actions’. The concept of process is necessary to account for 
the manner in which organisations exhibit changes in structure.
The three principles of action theory, together with the four additional concepts from systems 
theory, provide an action approach to the analysis of behaviour in organisations. Bowey goes 
on to illustrate her theory with case studies of five different types of organisations, all in the 
restaurant industry.
Postmodernism
With the development of the information and technological age a more recent view of organi-
sations and management is the idea of postmodernism. Cooper and Burrell refer to the 
contrasting postmodern view of ‘organisation less the expression of planned thought and 
calculative action and a more defensive reaction to forces intrinsic to the social body which 
constantly threaten the stability of organised life’.71
In the 1990s, writers such as Clegg described the postmodern organisation in terms of the 
influence of technological determinism and structural flexibility, premised on niches, multi-
skilled jobs marked by a lack of demarcation, and more complex employment relationships 
including subcontracting and networking.72
Postmodernism rejects a rational systems approach to our understanding of organisations 
and management and to accepted explanations of society and behaviour. Postmodern organisa-
tions are perceived as highly flexible and responsive, with decentralised decision-­making, fluid, 
less hierarchical structures and with the ability to change quickly to meet present demands.
Generalised sociological concept
The idea of postmodernism is, however, not easy to explain fully in clear and simple terms. 
It is arguably more of a generalised sociological concept rather than a specific approach to 
organisation and management. There is even some discussion of two connotations, and theo-
ries or philosophies of the concept depending on whether the term is hyphenated or not.73 
Perhaps understandably, therefore, the concept of postmodernism appears to have little inter-
est or appeal to the practical manager. Indeed Watson, for example, questions the value of 
labelling more flexible forms of bureaucratic structure and culture as postmodern or post-
bureaucratic and differentiating these from the modernist bureaucratic organisation.
The labelling of more flexible forms of bureaucratic structure and culture as ‘postmodern’ or 
‘post-bureaucratic’ is unhelpful. It is unrealistic to suggest that there is something new occur-
ring to work organisations at the level of the basic organising principle. There is no postmodern 
or post-bureaucratic organisational form available to us that is essentially different from the 
modernist bureaucratic organisation. We are indeed seeing different mixes of direct and indirect 
management control attempts as the world changes. But the world was always changing. Prob-
ably from the very beginning of industrialisation there has been a mixing of direct and indirect 
controls with emphases in one direction and then the other being made at different times.74
Nevertheless, postmodernist organisation can arguably be seen as a healthy challenge to more 
traditional approaches. It puts forward alternative interpretations of rationality, credibility and 
ambiguity, and a thoughtful critical perspective on disorders in work organisations, and reminds 
us of the complexities in our understanding of management and organisational behaviour.
An outline of developments in management theory is set out in Figure 2.3.

 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 the idea of postmodernist organisation can be likened to the ‘emperor’s new clothes’. it is easy to champion the idea 
in the classroom but in reality it is too abstract and vague, and lacks any real adaptive value for the practical manager. 
 How would YOU attempt to challenge this assertion? 

Part 1  The organisational setting
58
Relevance to management  
and organisational behaviour
The different possible categorisations are not necessarily a bad thing; they illustrate the dis-
cursive and complex nature of the study and practice of management and organisational 
behaviour. Discussion on the various categorisations of approaches and the identification of 
individual writers within a particular approach can provide a useful insight into the subject.
Whatever form of categorisation is adopted, the division of writers on organisation and 
management into various approaches offers a number of positive advantages. It is helpful in 
the arrangement and study of material and provides a setting in which to view the field of 
management and organisational behaviour. As Miner points out:
Schools of management thought are very much a reality, and the management student who 
approaches the field without at least a minimal understanding of them does so at some risk.75
A review of the different approaches helps in organisational analysis and in the identification 
of problem areas. For example, is the problem one of structure, of human relations or of the 
socio-technical process? It enables the manager to take from the different approaches those 
ideas that best suit the particular requirements of the job. For example, in dealing with a prob-
lem of structure, the ideas of the classical writers or of contingency theory might be adopted. 
When there is a problem relating to HRM, ideas from the human relations movement might 
be of most value. If the problem is one of environmental influence, insights from the systems 
approach might prove most helpful.
Caveats to be noted
There are, however, a number of caveats to be noted.
The various approaches represent a progression of ideas, each building on from the other 
and adding to it. Together they provide a pattern of complementary studies into the develop-
ment of management thinking. The different approaches are not in competition with each 
other and no one approach should be viewed as replacing or superseding earlier contributions. 
Many ideas of earlier writers are still of relevance today and of continuing importance in 
modern management practice.
Any categorisation of individual writers into specific approaches is inevitably arbitrary and 
not all writers can be neatly arranged in this manner. This is only to be expected. Such writers 
are expounding their current thoughts and ideas in keeping with the continual development 
of management theory and changes in management practice. The comment made about some 
management writers that they are saying different things at different times might therefore be 
taken more as a compliment than as a criticism.
Importance of cultural contexts
A major criticism of the attempt to define generalised models of management theory is the 
assumption of national culture. Schneider and Barsoux draw attention to how the different 
theories on how to organise all reflect societal concerns of the times, as well as the cultural 
backgrounds of the individuals. Different approaches reflect different cultural assumptions 
regarding, for example, human nature and the importance of task and relationships.76
Cheng et al. also question the universality of theories of management and organisational 
behaviour on the grounds that they have not adequately addressed the factor of culture: ‘Tra-
ditionally, the greatest aspiration of researchers is to discover objective, universalistic principles 
of behaviour. The tacit assumption behind this is that these principles may be discovered with-
out reference to cultural contexts.’ Cheng et al. conclude that while there may be some univer-
sality to organisation structures, for example the need for some form of hierarchy whatever its 
shape may be, different national cultures frequently give those structures different meanings.77

59
Chapter 2  Approaches to organisation and management
Value of management theory
Whatever the value of management theory, clearly no single approach to organisation and 
management provides all the answers. It is the comparative study of different approaches 
that will yield benefits to the manager. A knowledge and understanding of management 
theory will help with an awareness and appreciation of the complexities of modern work 
organisations.
Reporting on a twelve-year study of the knowledge and use of management concepts in 
technical organisations, Flores and Utley suggest that a look back at the theories and prin-
ciples that have been taught in the past could give an indication of the success of any new 
approach and help prepare today’s and tomorrow’s managers for the future.78 And Stern has 
this to say:
Management thinkers still have a lot to tell us. You don’t have to believe everything they say, 
but they may at least offer stimulation; they might provoke senior managers into abandoning 
complacency and trying to see problems in a new light.79
There is undoubtedly much scepticism about, and criticism of, management gurus. For 
example, in a cynical and provocative feature in The Times, Billen suggests that the tide is 
turning against the gurus and their gobbledegook.
In the past two decades, management theory, once rejected in Britain by both management 
and unions, has been deliberately imposed on almost every aspect of commercial and public 
life . . . It would be a brave new world without such gobbledegook in it but – to use a man-
agement theorist’s phrase – an empowered one, too. Managers would be chosen not for their 
ability to bandy jargon with their superiors but for their empathy, pragmatism, experience 
and decisiveness with their staff.80
However, according to McLean:
Of course, management theories have often been the subject of discourse and criticism. Some 
critics see organisational philosophies as management fads that will be replaced by new 
ones as other theories are proposed. That may well be the case, but it is good for manage-
ment theories to evolve, because organisations change, the environment changes, and as a 
result, management practices and techniques change . . . Theories provide us with valuable 
insights into how we can be more understanding, influential and ultimately more successful 
in managing organisations and the turbulent dynamic environments in which they oper-
ate . . . you of course, may have a different view!81
There are no definitive or final solutions to the problems of organisations. The nature of work 
organisations and the environment in which they operate is becoming increasingly complex and 
subject to continual change. However, at least we do understand more about the dynamics of 
management and organisational behaviour as a basis for the analysis of human behaviour in 
organisations.82 Stern suggests that ‘Management is both science and art, and the trick of it lies 
in separating the good ideas from the bad, knowing when to be scientific and when to be artful.’83
Conceptual thinking and  
management theory
In an interesting discussion on learning classic management theories, Robinson and Francis-
Smythe draw attention to the importance of conceptual thinking for managers and how far 
knowledge of formal academic theory helps in the discharge of managerial responsibilities. 
The overwhelming majority of established senior managers will be hard-pressed to identify 
a single significant occasion of decision-making guided by direct reference to a particular 
management theory. Even if names of respected theorists can be recalled, managers will be 

part 1 the orgAnisAtionAL setting
60
hard-pressed to provide a succinct explanation of their theories. Robinson and Francis-Smythe 
question what happens to all the theory that managers are exposed to during their training 
and education. 
   When in the light of their recognition-based decision-making, managers are asked to explain 
the role that academic theory plays in their approach to managing, they will frequently assert 
that it ‘must’ exert a subtle, covert, subconscious, or even subliminal infl uence over them. 
Whilst it would be easy to dismiss this as ‘wishful thinking’, there is good evidence to suggest 
that these assertions may actually be true . . . The inability to ‘name’ either a theory or a 
theoretician should not be taken to imply a failure to understand the theory in a more gener-
alised, more abstract, more conceptual way. 
 Robinson and Francis-Smythe suggest that academic knowledge is not, per se, a key profes-
sional requirement or an important aspect of managerial competence. Rather it will serve 
to underpin the process of building a repertoire of concepts that will be held in long-term 
memories in the way most likely to facilitate subsequent retrieval, good managerial moves and 
solutions to managerial challenges. 84 
 There are, then, many aspects to management. There are no simple solutions, no one best 
way to manage. However, study of diff erent approaches to organisations, their structure and 
management is still important for the manager and remains an indispensable part of the job. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 the historical study of different approaches to organisations and the development of management theory have little 
practical relevance. it is no more than a luxury for students and the time could be spent better on the study of more 
important topic areas. 
 How would YOU present a counterargument? To what extent has YOUR study of management theory been of per-
sonal value to YOU as a potential manager? 
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  A central part of the study of organisational behaviour is the development of management 
thinking and what might be termed ‘management theory’ 
  2  the work of leading writers can be categorised into various ‘approaches’ based on their views 
of organisations, their structure and management. 
  3   the classical writers placed emphasis on purpose and structure, technical requirements of the 
organisation, and assumption of rational and logical behaviour. 
  4  the human relations writers emphasised the informal organisation, group relationships, and 
the psychological and social needs of people at work. 
  5  the systems approach focuses attention on the interactions between technical and social vari-
ables and infl uences of the external environment. 
  6   contingency theory highlights possible means of diff erentiating between alternative forms of 
structures and systems of management. 

61
CHAPTER 2 APPROACHES TO ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT
  7  It is possible to identify a number of other approaches or sub-divisions of approaches includ-
ing technology decision-making, social action and postmodernism. 
  8   Whatever form of categorisation is adopted, there are a number of positive advantages but 
also criticisms and caveats to be noted, including cultural contexts. 
  9  A knowledge and understanding of management theory will help with an awareness and 
appreciation of the complexities of modern work organisations. 
  10   Ideas and instinct are both important to managers. It is necessary to view interrelationships 
among the development of theory, behaviour in organisations and management practice. 
  1  Detail fully how you would attempt to identify and analyse developments in management and organisational 
behaviour. 
  2  Assess critically the relevance of scientiﬁ c management to present-day organisations. To what extent does your 
university exhibit features of scientiﬁ c management? 
  3  Argue a positive case for bureaucratic structures. Select a large-scale organisation of your choice and suggest 
ways in which it displays characteristics of a bureaucracy. 
  4  What are the main conclusions that can be drawn from the Hawthorne studies? Discuss critically the relevance 
of these studies for management and organisational behaviour today. 
  5  Evaluate the application of the systems approach to the analysis of work organisations. Suggest an example of a 
work situation in which the systems approach might be appropriate. 
  6  Contrast approaches to improving organisational performance based on attention to technical and structural 
requirements with those based on concern for psychological and social factors. 
  7  Explain what is meant by a social action approach. Assess critically the practical relevance of ‘action theory’. 
  8  Discuss critically the practical value and relevance of the postmodernist view of organisations. 
  9  Present a detailed argument for the potential beneﬁ ts to managers from a study of management theory. 
  10  Outline brieﬂ y what you believe are the major trends in organisation and management since the beginning of 
this century. Which  one writer do you most associate with, and why?

 For many people, California-based Google is the most 
prominent example of a twenty-ﬁ rst-century com-
pany. Founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergei Brin, 
it grew very rapidly to become the world’s best-known 
search engine, accompanied by a proliferation of other 
ventures. The company’s name has achieved the rare 
distinction of becoming a verb in its own right – these 
days, we google, rather than search (and probably more 
often than we hoover). The company’s 2014 revenue 
was $66 billion 85 and, in 2015, the two founders were 
listed by  Fortune magazine as nineteenth and  twentieth 
in its list of the world’s billionaires. 86 This spectacular 
growth has been achieved by a company whose infor-
mal motto is ‘Don’t Be Evil’. How do the two ideas – 
commercial success and avoiding evil – work together 
in practice, and how well will the company be able to 
respond to the challenges that lie ahead in this turbu-
lent market? 
 Case study 
 Not being evil: Google 
➔

Part 1  The organisational setting
64
In commercial terms, the predominant contribu-
tor has been advertising revenues derived from the 
Google Internet search operation, which is based upon 
the highly successful PageRank technology developed 
by the founders. In common with all of the competi-
tive search engines, the Google Internet search service 
looks free to users, to the extent that this added value is 
probably now taken for granted by most. But Google’s 
success in its core business has been accompanied by a 
steady flow of new and intriguing ideas. For example, it 
is now completely routine to be able to search images 
as well as text, to call up detailed maps of anywhere on 
the planet, to switch to a satellite view or increasingly to 
photographic images at street level. The YouTube facility, 
acquired by Google in 2006, allows free access to a vast 
database of video clips uploaded by organisations and 
individuals. Google’s email service has grown rapidly 
and its Google+ service is aimed at the social networking 
market. In what used to be the separate mobile phone 
market, Google’s Android system, as well as Google’s 
range of phones and tablets, are engaged in a fierce 
battle with Apple’s iPhone and iPad.
Google’s rapid diversification looks like the very 
opposite of the ‘stick to the knitting’ recommendation 
in a best-selling strategy book twenty-five years earlier.87 
In diversifying, any company is choosing to serve new 
types of customers in unfamiliar markets and with the 
opposition of new incumbent competitors, all of which 
tends to increase the total risk for the company, as well as 
placing its core resources under strain. However, Google 
claims in its philosophy statement that this diversity 
stems from the application of its one core competence: 
search.88 From the outset, Google has actively sought 
out new opportunities and has deliberately fostered a 
culture to preserve and encourage this restlessness. As 
Tim Harford observes, Google fully expects most of its 
new ideas to fail, but its future lies with the ideas that 
do not fail.89 In a 2014 interview,90 Google’s two found-
ers commented that a key role of the company was to 
integrate diversity, in order that the services have a rec-
ognisable Google ‘feel’.
Growing pains?
How, then, can these cultural values be preserved as a 
company grows and changes? From its beginnings in 
a garage, Google had grown by the end of 2014 into a 
global corporation employing more than 53,000 world-
wide and operating out of seventy offices in forty coun-
tries around the world.91,92 It has, however, managed to 
retain its reputation for an informal and quirky style: for 
example, the company famously encourages its employ-
ees to spend 20 per cent of each working week working 
on projects that interest them, rather than their main 
responsibilities. The many accounts of life in its Google-
plex headquarters describe the mixture of working hard 
and playing hard – video games, pool tables, pianos and 
other leisure facilities are provided and commitment 
levels are expected to be very high. As can be seen from 
the examples of Google recruitment questions that can 
be found in Internet posts, the company is looking for 
very bright recruits who can think quickly, imaginatively 
and unconventionally.
In the tough competitive environments in which 
Google operates, it is hardly surprising that some have 
questioned how well its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ motto is holding 
up. Google attracted fierce criticism for its decision to 
comply with the Internet censorship laws in the People’s 
Republic of China for the search services it provides 
in that country. As can be seen from the company’s 
transparency statement, the censorship question is a 
continuing issue for Google (and other similar compa-
nies) in many parts of the world.93 There have also been 
concerns about privacy and data security, and Google 
was one of a number of multinational companies criti-
cised for tax avoidance in the UK, a claim it rejects 
emphatically.94
How does Google’s strength and culture equip it 
to deal with the market challenges it now faces? The 
first part of the answer is to re-examine the assump-
tions behind the story so far. As Kahneman points out 
in his book Thinking Fast and Slow,95 we should beware 
of seeing the story of Google’s development as some-
thing from which reliable, more general lessons can be 
learned. Making reference to Nassim Taleb’s concept of

narrative fallacy,96 he warns against underestimating the 
role of luck (i.e. alongside hard work, inspiration and 
talent) in the way it turned out – we should take care 
to notice the things that did not happen, as well as the 
well-documented events that make up the story. Above 
all, we should be cautious about any notion of using our 
‘understanding’ of the story so far to predict the future. 
This must be doubly so when the future in question is 
that of the global information industry.
Gentle giant or robber baron?
Google’s success has been based upon its mastery of 
Internet search, which has established it as a powerful 
global player, both while the Internet was growing around 
the world and in the later phases of user-generated con-
tent and the growth of social networking. But the next 
challenge is posed by the growing preference of users 
to access the Internet and its services via mobile smart-
phones, a change of format that threatens the standard 
models of revenue generation for a number of players, 
including Google. The effect of this is that those who want 
to remain major players have to build up their mobile 
capabilities.97 For some years, the smartphone sector has 
been a fierce (and often litigious) battle between Apple’s 
iPhone and devices based on Google’s Android operating 
system. As the New York Times put it in 2012:98
Last year, for the first time, spending by Apple and 
Google on patent lawsuits and unusually big-dollar 
patent purchases exceeded spending on research and 
development of new products, according to public filings.
As commentator Bryan Appleyard observes, Android is 
open – given away free to phone manufacturers – while 
Apple’s is not.99 Some see this same open/closed con-
trast in the corporate cultures of the two giants.100
From one point of view, consumers around the world 
have done very well from this competitive melee, with 
a succession of amazing devices at affordable prices. On 
the other hand, some (for example The Economist),101 
are more critical of the contemporary IT giants, drawing 
parallels between their plans and the late-career behav-
iours of the early 20th century US industrialists (Carne-
gie, Rockefeller, Harriman etc) known as ‘robber barons.’
’We’re charmed by their corporate mantras – for 
example “Don’t be evil” (Google) or “Move fast and 
break things” (Facebook). In their black turtlenecks 
and faded jeans they don’t seem to have anything in 
common with Rupert Murdoch or the grim-faced, silk-
hatted capitalist bosses of old. . . 
What gets lost in the reality distortion field that 
surrounds these technology moguls is that, in the end, 
they are fanatically ambitious, competitive capitalists. 
They may look cool and have soothing bedside manners, 
but in the end these guys are in business not just to make 
money, but to establish sprawling, quasi-monopolistic 
commercial empires. And they will do whatever it takes 
to achieve those ambitions’.102
It is perhaps futile to speculate about how this complex 
market will look in just a few years. In the twentieth 
century, much competition took place between well-
established large players (say, Ford and General Motors) 
in market domains characterised by stability and pre-
dictability. Twenty-first-century competition is different 
– technologies and market definitions are endlessly shift-
ing and changing, bringing new players into contention 
with each other and raising the stakes for all concerned. 
Google’s spectacular success in its relatively short exist-
ence so far has given it commercial strength and its cul-
ture has given it the flexibility to deal with rapid change.
 Tasks
	 1	 Examine the organisational development of Google using two of the four main analytical models in 
­Figure 2.1. Which do you think offers the best explanation of the company’s development, and why?
	 2	 What are the main challenges that Google faced in attempting not to ‘be evil’ as it expanded into new and 
unfamiliar territories and markets? How might local managers throughout the world create a corporate 
culture based on this motto?
	 3	 Is Google a ‘postmodern’ organisation or, in essence, no more than a globalised bureaucracy? Present the 
arguments on each side of the case.
	 4	 If you were to research the degree to which growth and change has affected the organisational behaviour 
of Google employees, which theoretical approach would you choose as the basis for your enquiry? Explain 
and justify your choice.

 recognition of the importance of the organisational environment and underlying realities of the work situation is an 
essential part of the study of management and organisational behaviour. 
 To what extent do YOU agree with this statement? Think critically about the environment of YOUR own university 
and the realities of student life. 
  CHAPTER 3 
 The organisational environment 
 applications of organisational behaviour and management take place 
not in a vacuum but within the context of a particular organisational 
setting and environment. The organisation is a complex social 
system and the sum of many interrelated variables. it is important to 
understand the main features that aff ect the structure, management and 
functioning of the work organisation, and which infl uence the lives of its 
members.

Perspectives of the organisation
Organisations in one form or another have always been an integral feature of human 
­civilisation. Although the origins of modern organisations can be traced back thousands of 
years, organisations evolve continually and those of today are clearly very different. The begin-
ning of the twentieth century, with the emergence of large corporate entities, and the work of 
writers such as Frederick Taylor on scientific management and Max Weber on bureaucracy, 
drew attention to the importance of the work organisation.1
Organisations are an integral part of society, involving both public and private sectors and 
including the voluntary and communities sector. All organisations have some function to per-
form. Through collaborative action, members of an organisation can achieve a synergistic 
effect and enable objectives to be achieved that could not be attained by the efforts of indi-
viduals on their own. There are many different types of organisations that come in all forms, 
shapes and sizes, and set up to serve a number of purposes and to meet a variety of needs. Not 
only are there many different types of organisations, but cultural differences in countries can 
reflect different conceptions of what actually is an organisation.2
Classification of organisations
In order to relate the study of management and organisational behaviour to one particular type 
of organisation as distinct from another, it is helpful to group similar types of organisations 
together. This enables generalisations to be made on the basis of certain characteristic fea-
tures of organisations within a particular grouping. Organisations can be distinguished by, for 
example, their nature and type, goods or services provided, size, aims and objectives, and the 
people who are employed by or who work in them. Organisations can, therefore, be classified 
in a number of ways and different writers have emphasised particular features of organisations.
A common classification of organisations is by major purpose. This leads to a distinction 
between, for example:
● economic – such as business firms;
● mutual – employee-owned, such as co-operatives or building societies;
● public service – such as government departments, local authorities and hospitals;
● social enterprise – social or environmental concerns such as fair trading;
● protective – such as the military, trade unions and police forces;
● social or associative – such as clubs and societies;
● religious – such as churches, monasteries and mosques;
● political – such as political parties, pressure groups;
● educational – such as universities, colleges and training centres; and
● voluntary and community – such as Citizens Advice Bureaux, RNLI or hospital radio. 
These organisations along with those not-for-profit are also called the third sector.
Such distinction, however, tends to lack refinement, and not all organisations fit simply into 
one classification. Social-enterprise organisations have both social and financial objectives. 
Many universities combine business consultancy with teaching. Some hospitals are concerned 
as much with training and/or research as with treatment of patients. One could debate the 
main purpose of a prison: is it, for example, corrective, protective, penal or educational? The 
main purpose of a trade union is seen, presumably, as protection of the interests of its mem-
bers through their wages and working conditions, but many trade unions also have strong 
social, educational and political interests. Many organisations serve more than one goal, but 
although they are multi-purpose organisations it is usually possible to identify one predomi-
nant goal (or purpose) by which the organisation can be classified, however crude this clas-
sification may be.

71
Chapter 3  The organisational environment
Private- and public-sector organisations
Organisations can, traditionally, be distinguished in terms of two generic groups: private-
enterprise organisations and public-sector organisations. The distinction can be made broadly 
on the basis of ownership and finance, and the profit motive. Private-enterprise organisations 
are owned and financed by individuals, partners or shareholders in a joint-stock company, and 
are accountable to their owners or members. They vary widely in nature and size, and in the 
type and scope of goods and services provided. The main aim is of a commercial nature, such 
as profit, return on capital employed, market standing or sales level.
Public-sector organisations are created by government and include, for example, municipal 
undertakings and central government departments, which do not have profit as their goal. 
Municipal undertakings such as local authorities are ‘owned’ by the council-tax payers and 
business ratepayers and financed by council taxes, business rates, government grants, loans 
and charges for certain services. Central government departments are ‘state owned’ and 
financed by funds granted by Parliament. Public-sector organisations have political purposes 
and do not distribute profits. Any surplus of revenue over expenditure may be reallocated 
through improved services or reduced charges. The main aim is a service to, and the well-being 
of, the community.
Smart and Inazawa suggest that although the size, scope and structure of the public sector 
differ extensively between different countries, there are seven common features that define the 
public sector in terms of seven main aspects of activity3 (see Figure 3.1).

 The private–public interface 
 The extent of the state ownership of public-sector operations, or of their  privatisation , and 
the balance between commercial and social interests are determined by the government of 
the day. Exposure to competition and demands for economical and high-quality services have 
prompted local authorities to place greater emphasis on practices of business management. 
 In spite of the fashion for applying private-sector techniques in government,  Saunders ques-
tions whether business and government are really comparable and whether business methods 
can win similar positive results for the public services. There are huge diff erences between 
business and government, and they have diff erent objectives. When it comes to notoriously 
complex and multidimensional challenges such as providing healthcare and education, just 
how far will the commercial metaphor stretch? Although some skills are transferable, strategi-
cally, the operations of state and commerce remain poles apart. 4 
 As an adviser to both the Labour Party and the Coalition,  Morrell suggests that while the 
public sector cannot be run like a business, it could be a lot more businesslike. 5 (Management 
in private-enterprise and public-sector organisations is discussed in  Chapter  10 .) 
 Not-for-profi t organisations 
 The increasing scale of privatisation and the blurring of commercial interests and social inter-
ests have led to an alternative classifi cation of organisations: those run for  proﬁ t; and those 
clearly  not for proﬁ t. Not-for-profi t organisations include on the one hand charities, private 
societies and most religious organisations, and on the other hand National Health Service 
(NHS) hospitals, universities, prisons, and most government and local authority departments. 
However, even in not-for-profi t public-sector organisations there has been increased govern-
ment pressure to ensure cost-eff ectiveness, investment by private-sector involvement, and effi  -
ciency and economy in their operations. 
 The same blurring of distinctions can also be seen in the case of charities. For example, 
 Arnott  points out that there is very little about twenty-fi rst-century charities that is straight-
forward and they exist in a highly complex context. 
   The old distinctions between private, public and not-for-profi t sectors have been blurred as 
charities have taken on an ever-increasing role in the delivery of public services. Tough com-
petition for funds and growing public scrutiny have led many charities to adopt practices 
once more commonly associated with the commercial sector. 6  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 generalised models of organisation serve no useful purpose. all organisations have their unique culture and working 
environment and no two organisations are the same. The skill of the manager is to understand clearly what takes 
place in their own organisation. 
 How would YOU attempt to defend this assertion? How would YOU explain YOUR own university or organisation? 
 Social-enterprise organisations 
 In recent years increasing attention has been given to a particular form of organisation that 
brings together aspects of both the private and public sectors – the  Social-enterprise organi-
sation . Although such organisations function as companies, their main concern is with the 
community in general rather than with shareholder value or specifi c public interest. Social-
enterprise organisations promote the well-being of society but are not charities, and they sug-
gest elements of both capitalism and socialism. 

73
Chapter 3  The organisational environment
Unlike not-for-profit organisations, social-enterprise organisations have a triple bottom line, 
trading in goods and/or services with social, environmental and financial objectives. However, as 
the name suggests, they have a primary concern with a social purpose and the creation of social 
value. Social enterprises are very diverse and may take a number of different forms including 
community enterprises, farmers’ markets, leisure trusts, recycling, transport and energy, provi-
sion of local services, and job creation and training. In the public sector there are many exam-
ples of social enterprises in primary and community health, care and welfare services.7
A particular example of a social-enterprise organisation is Grameen Bank, which provides 
microcredit loans without collateral to rural villages in Bangladesh (see the case study at the end 
of this chapter). Another example is Jamie Oliver’s project ‘Fifteen’, which offered disadvantaged 
young people opportunities for a career in the restaurant industry.
Other well-known examples include the Eden Project, The Big Issue, Café Direct and Divine 
Chocolate. Social-enterprise organisations are also developing internationally. A common theme 
is empowering people and harnessing their skills and abilities. In Singapore there is a non-profit 
‘Social Innovation Park’ that acts as a form of incubator for start-up social enterprises, including a 
dance centre that channels profits to bursaries for low-income students, cooking and deportment 
lessons for plus-sized people, and opportunities for individuals with untapped talents to showcase 
their original creations or to perform a dance or song. An example of social enterprise in the Ara-
bian Gulf is Sidab women in Oman who have mastered the formation of their own small business 
to market their sewing and photography, Omani home cooking and henna applications.
According to Lucas, there is an unprecedented level of interest in social enterprise as an 
alternative, more sustainable future business model. With increasing pressure on public-sector 
spending, the demand for social-enterprise services is increasing. However, two important 
issues that could hold back social enterprises are access to funding and the need for leadership 
and management skills to build business capacity.8 The European Commission also recognises 
the increasing potential of social enterprises as pioneers in developing new markets and creat-
ing sustainable jobs. However, entrepreneurs may lack business skills and there is a lack of 
measurement of the social value generated.9
Common features of organisations
Whatever their classification, all organisations have their own individual character, culture 
and sense of identity, and differ in their attributes, processes and methods of working. How-
ever, despite the differences, it must be remembered that all organisations are structures of 
people. Through collaborative action members can achieve a synergistic effect. They exist in 
order to achieve objectives and to provide satisfaction for their members. There are at least 
three common features of any organisation: people, objectives and structure.
It is the interaction of people in order to achieve objectives that forms the basis of an 
organisation. Some form of structure is needed by which people’s interactions and efforts are 
channelled and co-ordinated. We can add to these a fourth factor: management.
Some process of management is required by which the activities of the organisation, and 
the efforts of its members, are directed and controlled towards the pursuit of objectives.
Effectiveness of the organisation will be dependent upon the quality of its people, its objectives 
and structure, and the resources available to it. The interrelationship of people, objectives and 
structure, together with the efficient use of available non-human and human resources, will deter-
mine the success or failure of the organisation and the extent of its effectiveness (see Figure 3.2).
Differences in applications
Despite these common features, the structure, management and functioning of individual 
organisations will vary because of differences in their nature and type, respective goals and 
objectives, and the behaviour of the people who work in them.

Part 1  The organisational setting
74
Consider just two types of organisations towards the opposite ends of a possible 
­continuum – say, a maximum security prison and a university largely concerned with aca-
demic research – as a framework on which to focus attention. We can appreciate readily that 
although both types of organisation will be concerned with the basic activities of organisation 
and management, their goals and objectives, actual procedures and methods of operation, 
structure, systems and style of management, and orientation and behaviour of members will 
differ considerably (see Figure 3.3).
The organisation as an open system
Organisations differ in many important respects but they also share common features, and 
can be viewed as open systems that take inputs from the environment (outputs from other sys-
tems) and through a series of activities transform or convert these inputs into outputs (inputs 
to other systems) to achieve some objective (see Figure 3.4). By adopting the systems view of 
organisations, we can identify principles and prescriptions of organisation and management 
that apply to business organisations in general. Differences in the application and operation of 
these principles and prescriptions between one organisation and another are largely a matter 
only of degree and emphasis.
In terms of the open-systems model, the business organisation, for example, takes in 
resources such as people, finance, raw materials and information from its environment, trans-
forms or converts these and returns them to the environment in various forms of outputs such

Figure 3.4  The open-systems model of organisations
as goods produced, services provided, completed processes or procedures in order to achieve 
certain goals such as profit, market standing, level of sales or consumer satisfaction.
Applying the systems model, the same form of analysis can be applied to all types of organi-
sations. This provides a common point of reference and enables us to take a general approach to 
the study of organisations, to analyse them and to derive general principles and prescriptions.
An example of the open-systems model applied to the environment-systems division of a 
major heating and ventilation company is given in Figure 3.5.
Interactions with the environment
The structure, management and functioning of an organisation are determined not only 
by internal considerations and choices, but also influenced strongly by a range of volatile 
­external environmental factors. In order to be effective and maintain survival and growth, the 

Part 1  The organisational setting
76
organisation must respond to the opportunities and challenges, and the risks and limitations, 
presented by the external environment of which it is part.
The increasing rate of change in major environmental factors (technical, economic, social 
and governmental) has highlighted the need to study the total organisation and to adopt a 
systems approach. In addition to these major environmental factors, there is a multiplicity of 
constantly changing environmental influences that affect the operation of an organisation (see 
Figure 3.6). In order to understand the operations of organisations, and to improve organisa-
tional performance, it is necessary to consider how they achieve an internal and external bal-
ance and how they are able to adapt to changes in their environment and the demands placed 
upon them.10
Figure 3.5  An example of the open-systems model

77
Chapter 3 The organisaTional environmenT
 Consider, for example, how the management and operation of a large comprehensive 
school might be aff ected by such external infl uences as government proposals for reform of 
education, changing demographic trends, the general economic climate, advances in informa-
tion technology, changing views of the role of education in society, greater diversity of people 
in the catchment area, reports from Her Majesty’s Inspectors, increased health and safety 
concerns, social networking, representations from employers’ associations and trade unions, 
parent groups and equality campaigners. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 The ability to respond effectively to external environmental factors is clearly the single most important managerial 
skill influencing the successful performance and long-term survival of any organisation. 
 To what extent do YOU agree with this statement? Relate this claim to YOUR own university and/or organisation. 
 Figure 3.6  environmental infl uences on the organisation 
 PESTEL analysis 
 Organisational performance and eff ectiveness will be dependent upon the successful manage-
ment of the opportunities, challenges and risks presented by changes in the external environ-
ment. One popular technique for analysing the general environment is a  PESTEL analysis  – that 
is, Political, Economic, Socio-cultural, Technological, Environmental and Legal infl uences. As 
an example,  Lynch presents the main issues that might be considered when undertaking a 
PESTEL analysis ( see  Figure  3.7 ). 11 
 Worthington and Britton refer to the complexity of the external environment. 
 External infl uences are almost infi nite in number and variety and no study could hope to con-
sider them all. For students of business and for managers alike, the requirement is to recognise 
the complexity of the external environment and to pay greater attention to those infl uences 
which appear the most pertinent and pressing for the organisation in question, rather than to 
attempt to consider all possible contingencies. 12 

Part 1  The organisational setting
78
Analysis of work organisations
All organisations need clear aims and objectives that will determine the nature of inputs, the 
series of activities to achieve outputs and the realisation of organisational goals. Feedback 
about the performance of the system, and the effects of its operation on the environment, is 
measured in terms of achieving aims and objectives.
Basic principles of organisation and management apply in any series of activities in any 
organisation. For example:
● attention must be given to the design of a suitable structure;
● common elements of management – clarification of objectives, planning, organising, 
directing and control – apply to a greater or lesser extent in all cases;
● execution of essential financial, legal, human resources and administrative functions.

79
Chapter 3 The organisaTional environmenT
 These common features make possible the application of general principles of management 
and organisational behaviour (including, for example, in both a prison and a university) and 
the meaningful study of organisational theory. While general principles and prescriptions 
apply to all organisations, diff erences in their aims and objectives, organisational goals and 
environmental infl uences highlight alternative forms of structure, management, methods of 
operation and behaviour of people employed by or working in diff erent types of organisations. 
 Organisational sub-systems 
 Within the organisation (system) as a whole, each of the diff erent transformation or conver-
sion activities may themselves be viewed as separate  organisational sub-systems . A framework 
of fi ve main interrelated sub-systems as a basis for the analysis of work organisations can be 
identifi ed as: 
 ●  Task – the goals and objectives of the organisation: the nature of inputs and outputs, and 
the work activities to be carried out in the transformation or conversion process. 
 ●  Technology – the manner in which the tasks of the organisation are carried out and the 
nature of work performance: the materials, systems and procedures, and equipment used in 
the transformation or conversion process. 
 ●  Structure – patterns of organisation, lines of authority, formal relationships and channels 
of communication among members: the division of work and co-ordination of tasks by 
which the series of activities is carried out. 
 ●  People – the nature of the members undertaking the series of activities: for example, their 
attitudes, skills and attributes; needs and expectations; interpersonal relations and patterns of 
behaviour; group functioning and behaviour; informal organisation and styles of leadership.  
 ●  Management – co-ordination of task, technology, structure and people, and policies and 
procedures for the execution of work: corporate strategy, direction of the activities of the 
organisation as a whole and its interactions with the external environment. ( See  Figure  3.8 .) 
 The framework of fi ve main interrelated sub-systems – task, technology, structure, people 
and management – provides a useful basis for the analysis of organisational performance and 
eff ectiveness. Attention should be focused on the total work organisation and on the interrela-
tionships between the range of variables that aff ect organisational performance. 
 Contingency models of organisation 
 Irrespective of the identifi cation of sub-systems, the nature and scale of the series of activities 
involved in converting inputs to outputs will diff er from one organisation to another in terms 
of the interrelationships between technology, structure, methods of operation and the nature 
of environmental infl uences. ‘Contingency’ models of organisation highlight these interrela-
tionships and provide a further possible means of diff erentiation between alternative forms 
of organisation and management. The contingency approach takes the view that there is no 
one best, universal form of organisation. There are a large number of variables, or situational 
factors, that infl uence organisational performance.  (Contingency models are examined in 
 Chapter  11 .) 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 The traditional analysis of an organisation is usually based upon the structure and efficiency of individual depart-
ments. however, this leads to blinkered sectional interests rather than to the interrelationships and co-ordination of 
sub-systems of the organisation as an integrated whole. 
 What do YOU see as the relevance of the traditional form of analysis? 

Part 1  The organisational setting
80
Formal and informal organisations
So far we have been looking at the nature of formal organisations – that is, organisations 
deliberately planned and structured to meet stated objectives.
A formal organisation has been defined by Schein as:
the planned co-ordination of the activities of a number of people for the achievement of 
some common, explicit purpose or goal, through division of labour and function, and through 
a hierarchy of authority and responsibility.13
An organisation is a pattern of roles and a blueprint for their co-ordination. The object of 
­co-ordination is activities, not people.
The formal organisation is:
● deliberately planned and created;
● concerned with the co-ordination of activities;
Figure 3.8  Organisational sub-systems
   

81
Chapter 3  The organisational environment
● hierarchically structured with stated objectives; and
● based on certain principles such as the specification of tasks and defined relationships of 
authority and responsibility.
An organisation chart may give a representation of the formal structure. Other examples of 
the formal organisation are rules and regulations, policy manuals, standing orders and job 
descriptions. The formal organisation can exist independently of the membership of particu-
lar individuals.
The informal organisation
The formal organisation can be distinguished from the informal organisation – the difference 
between them is a feature of the degree to which they are structured. A major feature of organ-
isational life is that whatever the type or nature of an organisation or its formal structure, an 
informal organisation will always be present (see Figure 3.9). The informal organisation arises 
from the interaction of people working in the organisation, their psychological and social 
needs, and the development of groups with their own relationships and norms of behaviour, 
irrespective of those defined within the formal structure.
● The informal organisation is flexible and loosely structured.
● Relationships may be left undefined.
● Membership is spontaneous with varying degrees of involvement.

Part 1  The organisational setting
82
Group relationships and norms of behaviour exist outside the official structure, and the infor-
mal organisation may, therefore, be in conflict with the aims of the formal organisation. A 
summary of differences between the formal and the informal organisation is given in Table 3.1.
Functions of the informal organisation
The informal organisation can serve a number of important functions. It provides for:
● satisfaction of members’ social needs and a sense of personal identity and belonging;
● additional channels of communication – for example, through the ‘grapevine’, where infor-
mation of importance to particular members is communicated quickly;
● means of motivation – for example, through status, social interaction, peer rating, variety 
in routine or tedious jobs, and informal methods of work.

form of control over members; 
 ●  means of highlighting deﬁ ciencies or weaknesses in the formal organisation – for example, 
areas of duties or responsibilities not covered in job descriptions, or outdated systems and

 The informal organisation may also be used when formal methods would take too long, or not 
be appropriate, to deal with an unusual or unforeseen situation.

often gets done, as part of a casual chat or chance meeting. 14 
 The informal organisation, therefore, has an important infl uence on the morale, motivation, 
job satisfaction and performance of staff . It can provide members with greater opportunity 
to use their initiative and creativity in both personal and organisational development. Covert 
and informal activities may also have economic consequences for the organisation in terms of 
added values and/or costs that escape ordinary accounting procedures. 15 (The importance and 
nature of groups, and reasons why people form into groups, both formal and informal, are 
discussed in  Chapter  8 .) 
 Friendships and relationships at work 
 One particular aspect of the informal organisation that has received increasing attention is 
the possible eff ects of personal friendships and relationships at work, and potential confl ict 
between the informal and formal organisation. For example, according to  Vernon, while work 
is one of the best sources of friends as well as the most desirable place to have them, the 
trouble is that friendships at work are full of ambiguities. For friendships, the trouble with 
work is that you are there to be useful: to do something for a client, team or boss. Professional 
friendships will always be infl uenced and possibly determined by the utility factor. 16 Potential 
confl ict between personal freedom and team performance is discussed later  (see  Chapter  8 ). 
 The Code of Conduct for the Royal Bank of Scotland includes the following: 
 While the Group entirely respects the right of every one of us to form friendships and personal 
relationships at work, there will be occasions when it will be appropriate to tell your manager 
about a relationship that may impact on your work by creating a confl ict of interest. 17 
 Underlying realities of work organisations 
 Confl ict and stress are two underlying realities of work organisations that have a signifi cant 
infl uence on management and organisational behaviour. The two forces of confl ict and stress 
are often interrelated. Confl ict in many of its forms can have a contributory infl uence on 
stress, and people under stress may be more inclined to experience situations of confl ict. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 study of the planning and structure of the formal organisation is largely a waste of time. in reality it is the nature 
and working of the informal organisation that ultimately determines the operation and effectiveness of any work 
organisation. 
 Based on YOUR own experience, to what extent do YOU agree with this assertion? What practical examples can YOU 
give? 

Part 1  The organisational setting
84
Organisational conflict
Most of us will understand what is commonly meant by organisational conflict and be aware 
of its existence and effects. Conflict can be related to power and politics, or managerial style 
and leadership. But conflict can also arise from many different situations or actions and is a 
term that can be defined and interpreted in a number of ways. For our purpose we can see con-
flict as behaviour intended to obstruct the achievement of some other person’s goals. Conflict 
is based on the incompatibility of goals and arises from opposing behaviours. It can be viewed 
at the individual, group or organisation level. Ackroyd and Thompson use the term ‘organi-
zational misbehaviour’ to refer to ‘anything you do at work which you are not supposed to’. 
Management establish boundaries that distinguish acceptable and non-acceptable behaviour 
from employees. The actions of employees are then judged as falling one side or the other of 
these boundaries.18
Common definitions of conflict tend to be associated with negative features and situa-
tions that give rise to inefficiency, ineffectiveness or dysfunctional consequences. The tradi-
tional view of conflict is that it is bad for organisations. Conflict is perceived as disruptive and 
unnatural and represents a form of deviant behaviour that should be controlled and changed. 
Clearly, extreme cases of conflict in organisations can have very upsetting, or even tragic, con-
sequences for some people and have adverse effects on organisational performance. Conflict 
situations can give rise to excessive emotional or physical stress.
According to ACAS, conflict in the workplace can be divided into three categories: organ-
ised conflict, which manifests itself as strike action or action short of strike, wildcat strikes, 
occupations etc.; overt individual conflict, such as formal grievances raised over working 
conditions; and latent conflict, where the signs of unrest, discontent and disengagement are 
expressed through increased absence levels and higher turnover of personnel, a drop in per-
formance and more fractious interpersonal relationships between managers and the managed, 
which can lead to an increase in bullying and harassment.19
Contrasting perspectives of conflict
It might be expected that a healthy organisational climate would be reflected by complete har-
mony in working relationships, loyalty and common commitment to the goals and objectives 
of the organisation. This view of work organisations as ‘happy families’ is perhaps a worth-
while and creditable ideal and as such appears to be implied by a number of management writ-
ers. (See also the discussion in Chapter 10.)
Drucker, for example, makes the following point:
Any business enterprise must build a true team and weld individual efforts into a common 
effort. Each member of the enterprise contributes something different, but they must all con-
tribute towards a common goal. Their efforts must all pull in the same direction, and their 
contributions must fit together to produce a whole – without gaps, without friction, without 
unnecessary duplication of effort . . . The manager must know and understand what the 
business goals demand of him in terms of performance, and his superior must know what 
contribution to demand and expect of him – and must judge him accordingly. If these require-
ments are not met, managers are misdirected. Their efforts are wasted. Instead of teamwork, 
there is friction, frustration and conflict.20
Unitarist and pluralist perspectives
Such traditional views appear to imply a unitarist perspective of the organisation (discussed 
in Chapter 2). The natural state of the organisation is viewed as an integrated, co-operative 
and harmonious whole. There is an image of the organisation as a team with a common 

85
Chapter 3  The organisational environment
source of loyalty and one focus of effort. But if one accepts the idea of a pluralist per-
spective to work organisations, conflict is not necessarily a bad thing but can be an agent 
for evolution and internal and external change. The pluralist manager is more likely to 
accept that conflict in organisations requires careful handling and attempt to reconcile rival 
interests.
The radical perspective
The radical perspective is associated with the ideas of writers such as Karl Marx and the 
structuralist approach to organisations and management.21 It challenges the traditional 
view of conflict in society and sees organisations in terms of disparity in power and control 
between owners and workers. Conflict is an inherent feature of the unequal nature of organi-
sational life and a means of bringing about change.22 Collective bargaining is not seen as 
particularly helpful in a system stacked against the workers. Conflict is a natural part of the 
class struggle.
According to the radical approach, the design of organisation structure, management sys-
tems and the choice and use of technology all form part of the struggle for power and control 
within the work organisation. Greater attention should be given to relationships between the 
formal and informal aspects of the organisation and the study of conflict between the needs of 
the individual and those of the organisation, and between workers and management.
Broader interpretation of conflict
A more recent view of conflict is the interactionist perspective, which believes that conflict is a 
positive force and necessary for effective performance. This approach encourages a minimum 
level of conflict within the group in order to encourage self-criticism, change and innovation, 
and to help prevent apathy or too great a tolerance for harmony and the status quo.23
Conflict per se is not necessarily good or bad but an inevitable feature of organisational life 
and should be judged in terms of its effects on performance. Even if organisations have taken 
great care to try to avoid conflict, it will still occur. Conflict will continue to emerge despite 
management attempts to suppress it.
The current view appears to recognise that conflict can be interpreted more broadly than 
in the traditional view. Townsend sees conflict as a sign of a healthy organisation – up to 
a point.
A good manager doesn’t try to eliminate conflict; he tries to keep it from wasting the energies 
of his people . . . If you’re the boss and your people fight you openly when they think you’re 
wrong – that’s healthy. If your people fight each other openly in your presence for what they 
believe in – that’s healthy. But keep all the conflict eyeball to eyeball.24
Constructive conflict
Conflict, then, is not necessarily a bad thing. It can be seen as a ‘constructive’ force, and in 
certain circumstances it can be welcomed or even encouraged. Healthy conflict can help gener-
ate innovation and be seen as an aid to incremental improvement in organisation design and 
functioning, and to the decision-making process. Conflict can be an agent for evolution, and 
for internal and external change. Properly identified and handled, it can help to minimise the 
destructive influences of the win–lose situation.
In a discussion of conflict at board level, Dunne refers to the destructive force of failure to 
manage conflict. However, if the board focuses on a combination of the right strategy, right 
resources and right governance, and executives on strategic options, delivering the business 
plan and operational and financial integrity, then there is a much better chance of achieving a 
healthy degree of constructive conflict and sustained high performance.25

part 1 The organisaTional seTTing
86
 Confl ict and ‘diﬃ  cult people’ 
 The idea of confl ict as inevitable is discussed by  Irvine, who suggests that if you ask a group 
of managers about the nature and level of confl ict they experience, the majority will tell you 
honestly that, apart from the odd minor tiff , there is not much confl ict about. There are, how-
ever, ‘diffi  cult people’. 
 Perhaps our reluctance to identify, and then directly address, confl ict within organisations is 
based upon the widely held belief that confl ict is inevitable, negative and unmanageable. 
There is a tendency to see confl ict as a result of one person’s personality. Confl ict may be 
inevitable, but how dramatically situations could be changed if we could also view it as posi-
tive and manageable! What if we think of these situations as raising  questions of diﬀ erence? 
What if we were to make a shift away from blaming individuals and their personalities, 
recognizing instead that it is through normal human interaction that outward expressions of 
diff erence are produced? 26 
 According to  Mannering, confl icts, misunderstandings and personality clashes are usually at 
the root of the problem when employees become unhappy at work. There is an erosion of our 
social framework, and the work environment has become more competitive with pressure to 
have the best jobs and gadgets. People are placed into teams with people they would possibly 
never choose to associate with. Mannering suggests that people can be ‘diffi  cult’ for a number 
of reasons, but it is important not to concentrate on the negative points. Negativity is the most 
diffi  cult behaviour to overcome or change as it constantly undermines what the team is trying 
to achieve. 
 In order to help defuse confl ict, it is important to draw a fi ne line between fi rm management 
and aggressive behaviour. Humour may help defuse a situation but it is more important to stay 
calm and professional. Improved communications and relationships may help but if someone 
is determined not to co-operate, then there will be confl ict. Mannering makes the point that 
although you cannot please everyone all the time, avoidance is not an option for dealing with 
diffi  cult people. Managers must develop solid coping mechanisms and do their best in the 
particular situation. 27 
 Sources of confl ict 
 There are many potential sources of organisational confl ict, including those summarised as 
follows: 
 ●  Diﬀ erences in perception – We all see things in diff erent ways and have our own set of val-
ues, beliefs and opinions. Diff erences in perception result in individuals attaching diff erent 
meanings to the same stimuli. As perceptions become a person’s reality, value judgements 
can be a potential major source of confl ict.  (The importance of perception is discussed in 
 Chapter  6 .) 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 There are many positive outcomes from conflict that demonstrate commitment and enthusiasm about work activi-
ties. Properly managed, conflict can be an energising and vitalising force within groups and the organisation. manag-
ers should therefore be encouraged to invoke constructive conflict. 
 To what extent do YOU think potential benefits of constructive conflict are outweighed by negative aspects? How 
would YOU attempt to manage conflict? 

87
Chapter 3  The organisational environment
● Limited resources – Most organisational resources are limited, and individuals and groups 
have to fight for their share – for example, at the time of the allocation of the next year’s 
budget or when cutbacks have to be made. The greater the limitation of resources, then 
usually the greater the potential for conflict. In an organisation with reducing profits or 
revenues, the potential for conflict is likely to be intensified.
● Departmentalisation and specialisation – Most work organisations are divided into depart-
ments with specialised functions. Because of familiarity with the manner in which they 
undertake their activities, managers tend to turn inwards and to concentrate on the achieve-
ment of their own particular goals. When departments need to co-operate, this is a fre-
quent source of conflict. Differing goals and internal environments of departments are also 
a potential source of conflict, for example between task and element function (discussed in 
Chapter 11). In her study of management organisation of firms in this country, Woodward 
comments on the bad relationships between accountants and other managers. One reason 
for this hostility was the bringing together of two quite separate financial functions. People 
concerned with works accounting tended to assume responsibility for end results that were 
not properly theirs; they saw their role as a controlling and sanctioning one rather than 
as a servicing and supportive one. Line managers resented this attitude and retaliated by 
becoming aggressive and obstructive.28
● Nature of work activities – Where the activities of one person are dependent upon the 
work of others there is potential for conflict. For example, a worker is expected to complete 
the assembly of a given number of components each day but must rely on another worker 
forwarding the part-assembled components in good time. If reward and punishment sys-
tems are perceived to be based on performance levels, then the potential for conflict is even 
greater. If the work of a department is dependent upon the output of another department, 
a similar situation could arise, especially if this situation is coupled with limited resources.
● Role conflict – A role is the expected pattern of behaviours associated with members occu-
pying a particular position within the structure of the organisation. In practice, the man-
ner in which people actually behave may not be consistent with their expected pattern of 
behaviour. Problems of role incompatibility and role ambiguity arise from inadequate or 
inappropriate role definition and can be a significant source of conflict. (Role conflict is 
discussed in Chapter 8.)
● Inequitable treatment – A person’s feeling of unjust treatment, for example in the opera-
tion of HR policies and practices or in reward and punishment systems, can lead to tension 
and conflict. For example, according to the equity theory of motivation (discussed in Chap-
ter 7), the perception of inequity will motivate a person to take action to restore equity, 
including changes to inputs or outputs, or through acting on others.
● Violation of territory – People tend to become attached to their own ‘territory’ – for exam-
ple, to their own area of work, clients to be dealt with, or to their own room, chair or park-
ing space. Jealousy may arise over other people’s territory, such as size of room, company 
car, allocation of an assistant or other perks or through access to information or through 
membership of groups.29 Ownership of territory may be conferred formally, for example 
by organisation charts, job descriptions or management decisions; it may be established 
through procedures, such as circulation lists or membership of committees; or it may arise 
informally, for example through group norms, tradition or perceived status symbols. The 
place where people choose to meet can have a significant symbolic value. For example, if a 
subordinate is summoned to a meeting in a manager’s office this might be taken to mean 
that the manager is signalling higher status. If the manager chooses to meet at the subordi-
nate’s place of work, or on neutral territory, this may be a signal that the manager wishes 
to meet the subordinate as an equal. If a person’s territory is violated this can lead to the 
possibility of retaliation and conflict.
● Environmental change – Changes in an organisation’s external environment, such as eco-
nomic depression, increased competition, government intervention, new technology or 
changing social values, can cause major areas of conflict. For example, a fall in demand 
for, or government financial restrictions on, enrolments for a certain discipline in higher 

part 1 The organisaTional seTTing
88
education can result in confl ict over the allocation of resources. If the department con-
cerned is a large and important one and led by a powerful head, there could be even greater 
potential for confl ict. 
 Other potential sources of confl ict 
 There are many other potential sources of organisational confl ict, including: 
 ●  individual – such as attitudes, personality characteristics or particular personal needs, ill-
ness or stress; 
 ●  personal friendships, relationships and romance in the workplace – and potential confl ict 
between the informal and formal organisation, discussed above; 
 ●  group – such as group skills, team roles, patterns of interaction and group norms; 
 ●  organisation – such as communications, authority structure, leadership style, managerial 
behaviour; and 
 ●  the age gap –  Hart discusses how relationships between older employees and younger man-
agers, where experience is on one side and power on the other, can lead to confl ict. 
 The problem for the inexperienced manager in confl ict with an older employee is that it is 
all too easy to label someone ‘diffi  cult’ rather than intelligently trying to explore the reasons 
behind their behaviour. If steps are not taken to improve the relationship both manager and 
employee can end up feeling threatened and undermined. 30 
 
 Management and organisational behaviour in action case study 
 Based on real events 
 The production manager (Jack), quality control manager (Josh) and planning manager (Jill) work for a company pro-
ducing PvC raw materials for customers making a variety of PvC products, such as clothing, tarpaulins, seat covers, 
plastic containers, etc. here is a conversation on the shop fl oor between them concerning a customer complaint 
about the PvC raw materials. 
 Josh:  i wish your department would give more attention to quality, Jack. We can only do a 10% check on qual-
ity from our random sampling. now we have this complaint from a customer about quality on a batch we 
produced last week. and the boss is real mad . . . was real mad when i told him. 
 Jack:  Why the heck didn’t you come to me fi rst? . . . This puts me in a bad light before i have a chance to inves-
tigate and do something. You have assumed that the factory is to blame. . .  it could have been . . .  
 Josh:  You always have some excuse and start blaming others . . . like blaming me for poor quality-control 
checks. You’ve even put pressure on our department to be retrained, or even fi red, for poor quality-control, 
when you know we are under pressure with increased sales. have you forgotten . . . ? 
 Jack:  [interrupts] Why don’t you let me fi nish my sentence before you cut in and attack me? 
 Josh:  Well you’re always fi nding fault with me. so now you know what it’s like. anyway, what did you want to say? 
 Jack:  i wanted to suggest that our complicated delivery schedule can cause confusion. 
 Josh:  it’s you chaps that make it complicated. i’ve already checked with Jill on planning and also checked des-
patch. There was nothing wrong with the order. This is clearly a production mess up . . .  
 Jack:  Well i’m going to check with Jill’s schedule anyway to make sure we have got the right production 
schedule . . .  
 Josh:  go ahead . . . perhaps you will be able to blame Jill. 
 Jack:  What the hell are you talking about? . . . Who said anything about blame? i’m just trying to get to the facts 
before taking the rap for something we didn’t do. 
 Josh:  Well i don’t know about that Jack. as i walk through the plant, i’m not convinced that some of your supervi-
sors and operators really pay enough attention to quality and the correct operating procedures.

Chapter 3 The organisaTional environmenT
 The management of confl ict 
 Much has been written about the implications of confl ict as a social process. While recognis-
ing the importance of this debate, it is not the intention here to enter into a detailed discussion 
of the ideologies of confl ict. The important point is not so much the extent to which it is pos-
sible to create a totally harmonious working environment, or whether competing sub-groups 
and confl ict are seen as inevitable consequences of organisation structure, but how confl ict, 
when found to exist, is handled and managed. 
 Although a certain amount of organisational confl ict may be seen as inevitable, there are a 
number of ways in which management can attempt to avoid harmful eff ects of confl ict. Many 
of these ideas will be discussed in later chapters. The strategies adopted will vary according 
to the nature and sources of confl ict outlined above. Bear in mind that managing confl ict 
takes time and eff ort, but attempting to establish a climate of mutual trust, consideration and 
respect is worthwhile. 
 ●  Clariﬁ cation of goals and objectives – Continual refi nement and communication of goals 
and objectives, role defi nitions and performance standards will help to avoid misunder-
standings and confl ict. Focusing attention on superordinate goals that are shared by the 
parties in confl ict may help to defuse hostility and lead to more co-operative behaviour. 
 ●  Resource distribution – Although it may not always be possible for managers to increase 
their allocated share of resources, they may be able to use imagination and initiative to help 
overcome confl ict situations: making a special case to higher management; greater fl exibil-
ity to transfer funds between budget headings; or delaying staff  appointments in one area to 
provide more money for another area. 
 ●  HR policies and procedures – Careful and detailed attention to just and equitable HR poli-
cies and procedures may help reduce areas of confl ict. Examples are: job analysis; systems 
of reward and punishment; appeals, grievance and disciplinary procedures; arbitration and 
mediation; recognition of trade unions and their offi  cials; and training managers in coach-
ing and negotiation skills. 
 ●  Non-monetary rewards – Where fi nancial resources are limited, it may be possible to pay 
greater attention to non-monetary rewards, such as: job design; more interesting, challeng-
ing or responsible work; increased delegation or empowerment; improved equipment; fl ex-
ible working hours; attendance at courses or conferences; unoffi  cial perks; or more relaxed 
working conditions. 
 Jack:  You’re a real pain in the arse Josh! [shouting] 
 Josh:  so are you . . . [shouting] 
 Jill walks in and notices the tension. 
 Jill: 
 What’s the problem chaps? 
 Jack:  Josh is blaming production for a quality problem from a customer complaint and. . .  
 Josh:  not blaming, simply stating a fact that. . .  
 Josh:  That’s absolute bull! 
 Jill: 
 it seems that you chaps have two problems. a problem with the job – the complaint – and a problem with 
your confl ict. i can’t see you solving the complaint until you manage your confl ict better.

 Tasks 
  1.  What do you see as the underlying cause of the confl ict between Jack and Josh? 
  2.  if you were Jill, how would you encourage Jack and Josh to investigate the complaint? 
  3.  how would you attempt to avoid further confl ict? 

part 1 The organisaTional seTTing
90
 ●  Development of interpersonal/group process skills – This may help engender a better 
understanding of one’s own behaviour, the other person’s point of view, communication 
processes and problem-solving. Attention to body language may also assist people to work 
through confl ict situations in a constructive manner. Where possible, encourage addressing 
disputes early on a one-to-one basis. 
 ●  Group activities – Attention to the composition of groups and to factors that aff ect group 
cohesiveness may reduce dysfunctional confl ict. Overlapping group membership with a 
‘linking-pin’ process, and the careful selection of project teams or task forces for problems 
aff ecting more than one group, may also be benefi cial. 
 ●  Leadership and management – A more participative and supportive style of leadership and 
managerial behaviour is likely to assist in confl ict management: showing an attitude of 
respect and trust; encouraging personal self-development; and creating a work environ-
ment in which staff  can work co-operatively. An open-door policy and identifying potential 
causes of disputes may help avoid confl ict. 
 ●  Organisational processes – Confl ict situations may be reduced by attention to such features 
as: the nature of the authority structure; work organisation; patterns of communication 
and sharing of information; democratic functioning of the organisation; and unnecessary 
adherence to bureaucratic procedures and offi  cial rules and regulations. 
 ●  Socio-technical approach – Viewing the organisation as a socio-technical system, in which 
psychological and social factors are developed in keeping with structural and technical 
requirements, will help in reducing dysfunctional confl ict. 
 Confl ict resolution 
 An ACAS policy paper on managing confl ict and individual employment disputes concludes 
that: 
 While the scale and direction of individual workplace confl ict is both contested and diffi  cult 
to measure, there has been less disagreement as to the potentially damaging eff ects for both 
the individuals and organisations involved. Furthermore, there has been a degree of consen-
sus that changes in the structures of workplace representation and the changing balance 
between the responsibilities of HR and line management have a signifi cant impact on the 
capacity of organisations to resolve diffi  cult issues in the workplace. 31 
 From an analysis of fi ve case studies, ACAS found that in larger organisations eff ective confl ict 
management revolves around informal social processes, underpinned by high-trust relation-
ships between key organisational stakeholders. However, these relationships are threatened by 
more centralised models of HR, and the lack of confi dence and capability of line managers 
to deal with diffi  cult issues. Evidence suggests confl ict management was seen as a lower-order 
skill and the support of senior managers was crucial. There is need for developing structures 
of employee representation and increased investment in developing the skills and confi dence 
of line managers. The analysis highlights the importance of communications between manag-
ers and staff  and the positive role of performance management systems and employee engage-
ment in confl ict situations. 32 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Potential for interpersonal conflict should be accepted as a reality of organisational behaviour. hr has limited influ-
ence. The only effective way to mitigate adverse effects of conflict is through recruiting members of staff with the 
inherent skills and ability to manage people and social interactions at work. 
 Do YOU agree? If asked at interview, how would YOU attempt to demonstrate YOUR skill at managing people?

Chapter 3  The organisational environment
Organisational stress
In addition to organisational conflict, a major and related influence on the work/life balance 
(discussed later in this chapter) is the extent to which employees suffer from organisational 
stress. Stress is a complex and dynamic concept. It is a possible source of tension and frustra-
tion, and can arise through a number of interrelated influences on behaviour, including indi-
vidual, group, organisational and environmental factors (discussed in Chapter 1).
York contends that, despite all the business-speak, people get seriously vague when it comes 
to definitions, and raises the question: what is stress? Is it a new name for an old-fashioned 
condition such as unhappiness or overwork, or is it peculiar to our uniquely pressured times? 
York suggests there is something in the idea that stress is not just about hard work or unhappi-
ness, but about conflict, confusion and frustration. It is about the anxiety generated by multi-
tasking and balancing priorities, meeting contradictory demands, about knowing where to 
start and papering over the cracks when you want to do too much.33
Scepticism
Understandably perhaps, there is a level of scepticism about the amount of attention given to 
stress, and a number of press and other articles feature the ‘myth’ of work stress. For exam-
ple, an interesting report from the Institute for Social and Economic Research suggests that 
claims of workplace pressure may be misplaced. Levels of job satisfaction and mental distress 
vary systematically according to the day of the week on which respondents are interviewed. 
Stress appears to disappear on Friday and Saturday. When genuine dissatisfaction was found, 
it tended to be because employees were working too few or too many hours. However, the 
main cause of stress was money difficulties, caused by unemployment or debt. The research 
casts a question mark over the generous compensation regularly handed out by the courts to 
employees claiming they suffer from stress.34
Randall comments that ‘Whichever lawyer first hit on the idea of promoting stress as either 
a reason for not going to work or a way to make others cough up could hardly have done 
more damage to Britain’s work ethic than if he or she had arranged a quintupling of dole 
payments.’35
Despite the scepticism, however, an increasing number of surveys report perceived or actual 
increases in levels of stress and contend that stress at work is one of the biggest problems in 
European companies and one of the major adverse influences on the quality of working life 
and work performance. There have also been a number of highly publicised reports of suc-
cessful legal claims based on the effects of stress.
A CBI survey on absence and workplace health reported that, although non-work-related 
anxiety/stress/depression was then a major cause of long-term illness absence, 29 per cent of 
absences were attributed to work-related stress and it is on the increase.36
Causes of stress
Whatever the effects, it is generally acknowledged that stress is potentially part of everyday 
working life. It occurs for a variety of reasons, including individual differences and types of 
personality, occupation and actual stressful nature of the job (whether working in the private 
or public sector) and organisational conflict (discussed earlier in this chapter). External eco-
nomic pressures, such as a result of recession, also account for an increase in stress.
Other sources of stress at work include the following:
● Restructuring of organisations and reductions in staffing levels resulting from demands for 
improved business competitiveness and lower operating costs have placed greater pressures 
on remaining staff.

Part 1  The organisational setting
92
● The long-hours culture, increased workloads and work intensification, together with unrea-
sonable deadlines.
● Excessive rules and regulations and greater bureaucratic burdens, especially among profes-
sional groups.
● Developments in information and communications technology (ICT) that mean staff are 
far more constantly and easily contactable and expected to deliver everything faster. This 
can lead to greater pressure on individuals, a reluctance to switch off and a blurring between 
work and home life.
● Organisational changes such as redundancies and the loss of key members of staff that 
place extra demands on managers.
● Authoritarian styles of leadership and management. For example, as Cooper points out: 
‘one of the key factors which contribute to employees being stressed at work and suffering 
from ill health is their line manager’.37
● Interpersonal relationships at work, especially with team colleagues; poor communica-
tions; office politics.
● Lack of empowerment and autonomy over control of work. Stress is often caused by the 
hierarchical structure of the organisation or lack of delegation and empowerment.
● Organisation structure and role relationships. Lack of clarity about expected patterns of 
behaviour, or role conflict, is a potential source of stress (discussed in Chapter 8).
Cultural differences
To what extent do causes of stress vary according to different cultures? There is some evidence 
to suggest that the incidence of stress does not vary noticeably among different cultures. For 
example, Type A personalities (discussed in Chapter 4) exhibit similar levels of stress across 
the UK, Hungary, Italy, Israel and the USA.38 From a study of European Canadians, East Asian 
Canadians and Japanese exchange students, Tweed et al. identified variations between culture 
and ways of coping with stressful events.39 Another study of a diverse set of countries across 
the Anglo world, China and Latin America suggests that stress caused by long work hours can 
be mitigated by a strong social support network, such as families or friends.40
Stress or pressure: is stress necessarily  
to be avoided?
According to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), people get confused about the differ-
ence between pressure and stress: ‘We all experience pressure regularly – it can motivate us to 
perform at our best. It is when we experience too much pressure and feel unable to cope that 
stress can result.’41 HSE defines work stress as: ‘The adverse reaction people have to excessive 
pressures or other types of demand placed on them at work.’ Stress is not an illness – it is a 
state. However, if stress becomes too excessive and prolonged, mental and physical illness 
may develop. Stress can hit anyone at any level of the business and recent research shows that 
work-related stress is widespread and is not confined to particular sectors, jobs or industries.42
A certain amount of stress may not necessarily be seen as a bad thing and may perhaps even 
help promote a higher level of intensity and motivation to get work done. It is arguable that 
stress is a normal motivating factor and, in moderation and in short spells, stress may be good 
for you. It is important to bear in mind, however, that stress is potentially very harmful. But 
what is the distinction between pressure and stress? ‘Pressure’ can be seen as a positive factor 
that may be harnessed to help people respond to a challenge and function more effectively. 
‘Stress’ may be regarded as a continuous negative response arising from extreme pressure or 
other demands and the individual’s inability to cope.

Chapter 3 The organisaTional environmenT
 According to  Cobb, the issue of pressure is a complex one, though some small changes can 
make all the diff erence in assisting you. Cobb refers to two separate aspects of stress: 
 ●  pressure that comes from outside, for example working to imposed deadlines when you 
have many other tasks to perform as well, which places emphasis on your planning skills; 
 ●  pressure from within and self-imposed, for example if you are a perfectionist and every-
thing has to be just so in your work, which suggests you should look at why you have devel-
oped this attitude and learn to be a little easier on yourself. 43 
 Stress is a very personal experience, as is the response of each individual to it and their beliefs 
about how best to cope with the causes and eff ects.  Gwyther points out that although stress 
appears to have become public health enemy number one and is viewed as the culprit of myr-
iad complaints, the term is bandied about far too readily and there is a need to stand back and 
attempt to get things into some sort of perspective. A measure of stress is natural. A degree of 
stress at work is no unhealthy thing and without it nothing would ever get done. 44 
 However, it is important to bear in mind that although management may believe that a 
moderate level of stress can be a spur to increased work performance, employees are unlikely 
to perceive this in the same way and will dispute what is regarded as an acceptable level of 
stress or excessive pressure. As ACAS points out, while some amount of stress can be useful 
as a spur to motivation it is important to avoid the adverse reaction. This can include physical 
symptoms such as headaches, stomach problems and muscle tension, and mental symptoms 
such as anxiety and depression. These reactions can be extremely debilitating and result in 
reduced productivity, absenteeism and poor morale in the workplace. 45 
 A summary of the nature and causes of stress is given in the concept map in  Figure  3.10 . 
 Coping with stress 
 There are a number of measures by which individuals and organisations can attempt to reduce 
the causes and harmful eff ects of stress. There are also many suggested techniques to help 
individuals bring stress under control – for example, changing one’s viewpoint, identifying 
causes of distress, eff ective time management  (discussed in  Chapter   16 ), expanding one’s 
social network, laughing and telling jokes, relaxation training, working on stress reduction 
and appreciating that some stress can be useful. However, there are not always easy remedies 
for stress and much depends upon the personality of the individual. 
 Techniques such as relaxation therapy may help some people, although not others, but still 
tend to address the symptoms rather than the cause. Organisations also need to give greater 
attention to training, support and counselling and to the work organisation and job design. 
However,  Briner suggests that talking therapies certainly can be useful in some circumstances, 
but if problems of high-level stress-related issues are caused by a poor working environment 
or poor management, then counselling is unlikely to help or, if it does, the eff ects are likely to 
be only short-lived. 46  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 People may be busy and under pressure, but stress is far too much an overused word. stress has become something 
of a fashion and many people appear to compete for who is most stressed. The biggest danger is that the more peo-
ple talk about stress, the more likely they will really become stressed. 
 What are YOUR honest views? Do YOU feel the need to talk about stress?

Chapter 3  The organisational environment
Effective communications and conversation
Effective two-way communications at all levels of the organisation are clearly important in 
helping to reduce or overcome the level of stress. Staff should feel able to express their true 
feelings openly and know they will be listened to. However, in addition to good communi-
cations, Reeves refers to the importance of conversation for maintaining relationships and 
suggests a case for a conversation culture. The ability to hold good-quality conversations is 
becoming a core organisational and individual skill. Unlike communication, conversations 
are intrinsically creative and roam freely across personal issues, corporate gossip and work 
projects: ‘Conversations are a defence against stress and other mental health problems. People 
with good social relationships at work are much less likely to be stressed or anxious.’47
A growing number of organisations are introducing an email-free day to encourage staff to 
use the telephone or walk across the corridor to talk more with one another.
Informing members of staff in the first place about what is happening, especially at times of 
major change, involving them proactively in the change process and allowing people to feel in 
control and exercise their own discretion reduce uncertainty and can help minimise the potential 
for stress. Managers can do much to create a psychologically supportive and healthy work envi-
ronment. Treating people with consideration, respect and trust, giving full recognition and credit, 
getting to know members of staff as individuals and placing emphasis on end results can all help 
to reduce stress. Managers should attempt to be role models, and through their language and 
body language indicate to others that they are dealing effectively with their own work pressures.
EU framework agreement
The European Commission states that work-related stress is one of the biggest health and 
safety factors that we face in Europe today. Work-related stress can be approached on differ-
ent levels – individual worker, work organisation, national and EU level. Aside from the legal 
obligations, stress is a problem for the individuals, their work organisation and society, and 
work-related stress problems are increasing.
At European Union level, social partners have negotiated agreement on work-related stress to 
identify and prevent or manage problems. The agreement identifies a number of anti-stress 
measures, dealing primarily with management and communication such as clarifying com-
pany objectives and the role of individual workers; ensuring adequate management support 
for individuals and teams; matching responsibility and control over work; improving work 
organisation and processes, working conditions and environment.48
According to the Commission, the most common causes of work-related stress are: job reor-
ganisation or job insecurity (72 per cent), hours worked or workload (66 per cent), unaccepta-
ble behaviour such as bullying or harassment (59 per cent), lack of support to fulfil one’s role 
(57 per cent), lack of clarity on roles or responsibilities (52 per cent) and limited possibilities 
to manage one’s own work patterns (46 per cent).
Moreover, employees affected by stress are not in a position to deploy full potential and 
contribute as much as they could to the development of the company for which they work – 
not to mention the human costs and lifelong repercussions of psychosocial diseases for the 
employees concerned and their families.
The Commission also draws attention to the gap between the legal obligations of EU 
employers to manage stress and psychosocial risk at the workplace and practices actually 
observed. Numerous examples confirm work-related stress can be approached in the same 
manner as other health and safety issues.49
HSE Management Standards
According to HSE, ‘Well-designed, organised and managed work is good for us but when 
insufficient attention to job design, work organisation and management has taken place, it 
can result in work related stress.’ HSE has developed the Management Standards approach 

Part 1  The organisational setting
96
to tackling work-related stress; these standards represent a set of conditions that, if present, 
reflect a high level of health, well-being and organisational performance. They are based on 
the familiar ‘Five steps to risk assessment’ model, requiring management and staff to work 
together.50 See Figure 3.11.
Use of kaizen principles
Another interesting approach to reducing stress is through the use of the Japanese kaizen 
principles (see also Chapter  16). According to Scotchmer, applying the kaizen 5S method 
(translated into English as Sort, Straighten, Shine, Standardise and Sustain) can help increase 
efficiency and productivity, raise morale and lower an individual’s stress levels: ‘The busier you 
are the tidier your desk should be; that is if you wish to get ahead and deliver more with less 
stress.’51
Individual needs and expectations
Rigby points out that stress at work is getting worse, and the problem for those who would 
seek an easier life is that big-money jobs generally come with a big chunk of hassle attached. 
People suffering from high stress at work should try switching to a job more in tune with their

individual needs and expectations. Rigby suggests fi ve prescriptions for those seeking a lower-
stress job and a healthier, more satisfying work/life balance. 
 ●  Stability and security – Consider professional jobs, those requiring specialised technical 
knowledge or jobs in obscure sectors such as industry and food technology. 
 ●  Personal contact – Forging strong relationships with customers and colleagues can be great 
for stress relief, but avoid front-line contact with overbearing customer-care departments or 
call centres. 
 ●  Right kind of boss – Unless you have a good boss, look for a job that gets you out on your 
own a lot or allows fl exible working, or become self-employed. 
 ●  Change, pressure and perception – Look for fi rms changing fast because they are leading 
the way, but avoid working for a fi rm where change is imposed because it is trying to catch 
up. Consider also the public perception of how far the job is important or socially useful. 
 ●  Potential for fulﬁ lment – Even if the work is hard and long, look for jobs that are creative 
or engaging or provide a sense of worth or satisfaction. 52 
 Work/life balance 
 We have looked at the importance, nature and some main features of work organisations as 
an integral feature of human civilisation. But what role do, or should, organisations play in 
the lives of their staff  or with broader concerns for the work/life balance? What are the ethi-
cal considerations and how much also depends upon the individual’s orientations to work? 
 (Discussed in  Chapter  1 .) 
 It is not easy to determine the extent to which attention to the quality of working life and 
the work/life balance is based on the exercise of a genuine social responsibility and a moral or 
ethical motivation  (discussed in  Chapter  14 ) or based primarily on the pursuit of economic 
effi  ciency and motivated through good business practice and enlightened self-interest. But to 
what extent should the work/life balance form part of the ethical concern or underlying values 
of an organisation? Opinions appear to be divided. For example,  Sternberg, while recognis-
ing the importance of treating employees ethically, does not support the belief that a business 
should be run for the benefi t of its employees or should, by action or by omission, encourage 
employees to have inappropriate expectations of the business. 
   Despite widespread notions to the contrary, it is not the role of business to give meaning to 
the lives of its employees or to provide social welfare or full employment; business is not a 
substitute for family or community, the church or the state. 53 
 The European Commission, however, still stresses the importance of helping people to 
improve their work/life balance, and continues to unveil a series of packages to update existing 
EU legislation. The Commission also draws attention to the interactions between work/life 
balance and public policy. 
  While the choices that people make when combining the professional, private and family 
aspects of their lives are primarily personal, the way in which they balance these competing

tion therapy, may be well intended but are difficult to implement and have little adaptive value. stress is predomi-
nately a feature of a person’s personality and must be accepted as such.

demands has direct consequences for public policy. It influences, for example, the number 
of children people choose to have, or if they decide to work or not. At the same time, public 
policy itself influences these choices: the existence of public provision of care for children and 
other dependents, for instance, or legal rights to family related leave.54
Meaning in people’s lives
Popular press articles often suggest that work is still a large component of what gives meaning 
to people’s lives and give examples of big lottery or pools winners staying in work and often in 
their same, even apparently routine, jobs. Other surveys and reports continue to suggest that 
the workplace is no longer a central feature of social activity. For a majority of people the main 
reason for work remains the need for money to fulfil the necessities of life. However, much still 
appears to depend on the extent of an individual’s social contacts and activities outside of the 
work situation.
A European Industrial Relations Review points out that work/life balance is an issue of 
growing concern within the UK:
The declining influence of trade unions in regulating the employment relationship, job inse-
curity, the extension of operating and opening hours, and the impact of new forms of infor-
mation and communications technology on work are just some of the factors that have made 
it increasingly difficult for workers to balance their work and their personal lives.55
Is work/life balance still important?
Many staff still have specific places of work and agreed times in which to undertake their 
duties. However, technology and the Internet allow for greater flexibility in work schedules. 
So-called knowledge workers, who work from home on computers, with greater control over 
their roles and work times, arguably have improved motivation and productivity. But, in a 
thought-provoking article, Reeves questions the extent to which progress has been made in 
establishing a healthy equilibrium between our working day and personal time and if work/life 
balance is still an issue or already past its sell-by date. The phrase has been contested for the 
presumption that life is better than work and that the two are separable in a clear-cut way that 
allows a calculation of ‘balance’ between them.
Continuing concern with the issue cannot be explained simply with reference to working 
hours. Work/life balance is moving towards a concern with flexibility and parenting. It taps 
into a desire for greater autonomy at work, a shift in gender roles within the family, the pos-
sibilities of technology and an intensification of working life. The conclusion from Reeves is:
It would be a shame if work/life balance faded away into the dustbin of business jargon. 
Underneath its banal-sounding aspirations are some deep-seated, radical challenges to 
organisations and to individuals. If work/life balance means anything of value at all, it is a 
clarion call for a better quality of life, for better parenting and, above all, for greater personal 
autonomy. It seems to me that work/life balance is either a crusade for human freedom or it 
is nothing.56
ACAS points out that the pace of change is now more rapid than ever, and with organisations 
under constant pressure to match the requirements of customer and business there is a need 
for work/life balance and flexible working.57 (Flexible patterns of working are discussed in 
Chapter 11.)
The Department for Business Innovation & Skills (BIS) draws attention to the continuing 
importance of family structure and work satisfaction.
The issue of how to promote the balance of work and family responsibilities is a major policy 
concern and has deserved increasing scholarly activity attention in recent years. As this report 
has shown the relationship between the labour market and the household is an important 

99
Chapter 3  The organisational environment
determinant in understanding people’s living conditions in current society. Particularly, this is 
the case for women who traditionally have assumed most of the duties in the rearing of chil-
dren while in the last few decades have increasingly been incorporated in the labour market 
to pursue a professional career.
BIS points out that work/life balance policies play an important role in worker satisfaction 
and this effect seem to be gender neutral. Male workers in ‘family-friendly’ environments also 
experience higher levels of job satisfaction and involvement.58
Business Link also emphasises the business benefits of improved work/life balance. It can 
enable employees to feel more in control of their working life and lead to increased productiv-
ity, lower absenteeism and a happier, less stressed workforce.
Introducing employment practices that encourage a healthier work/life balance for your 
employees can bring real benefits to your business. Flexible working and work/life balance 
policies will also foster a more positive perception of you as an employer. This can lead to 
better relations with your employees and greater staff loyalty, commitment and motivation, 
reducing staff turnover and recruitment costs.59
A family-friendly model
According to Black, employers that promote a healthy work/life balance maximise productiv-
ity and optimise their corporate performance. In order to attract the best staff there is a rise in 
the family-friendly employer offering best packages to staff including flexible working condi-
tions and characteristics to promote a happy and healthy work/life balance. Black suggests 
five, not mutally exclusive, reasons: the commercial reality of flexible working; the contribu-
tion of female leadership; advantages of diversity; an aid to recruitment; and demographic 
changes. Black also suggests three parts to a family-friendly model:
● Culture – the first and most important aspect and this comes from managers; you need 
someone very senior and on message.
● Emotional and developmental – helping parents to get clarity on choices they make, includ-
ing one-to-one coaching programmes, mentoring schemes and online maternity coaching 
packages.
● Practical – practical solutions to support the right culture and clarity on priorities, for exam-
ple parents’ network, provisions for childcare and elderly care support. A downside to more 
flexible working patterns is old networks of friends and families do not work as they used to.60
The workplace of the future
The evolving nature of work organisations and the social context has led to a climate of con-
stant change and the need for greater organisational flexibility. Managers need to be aware of 
new psychological contracts and to adopt alternative styles of management. Cloke and Gold-
smith refer to the rise of organisational democracy. There is a demand for alternative organi-
sational practices, and a far-reaching transformation has already begun, based on the idea that 
management as a system fails to open the heart or free the spirit. The age of management is 
coming to an end and the real push for the future is for more authentic human relationships 
and the humanisation of organisations as crucibles for personal growth and development.61
Generation X and Generation Y
Management Today commissioned a survey from FreshMinds looking at the future world of 
work and the contrasting attitudes and perspectives of three different generations and age groups:
● the confident, footloose, wire-free Generation Y (born between 1980 and 1995 and typified 
by travel first, then a career);

part 1 The organisaTional seTTing
100
 ●  the mellow  baby-boomers (born between 1946 and 1963 and typifi ed by a search for secu-
rity); and 
 ●  the pig-in-the-middle  Generation X (born between 1964 and 1980 and typifi ed by after the 
slog, the rewards). 
 From the online survey of 1,000 people, supplemented by three extensive focus-group sessions, 
emerges ‘a complex picture of a workforce in a state of fl ux, struggling to come to terms with 
the changed realities of today’. This new world of work is termed ‘Work 2.0’. As the num-
ber of baby-boomers declines and the proportion of Generation Y increases this will have an 
impact on the work environment. 
 Generation X have another three decades at work, but this is a diff erent world of work from 
the one they entered fi fteen or so years ago and there is less confi dence and few guarantees 
about their fi nancial future. 
 By contrast,  Generation Y will have fewer problems in adapting to the changed realities of 
the twenty-fi rst century. For example, they are likely to be more technologically sophisticated. 
 Encouraging the three diff erent age groups to work happily as a team will require imagi-
nation on all sides and competent management. For example, the infl uence of the Second 
World War on the baby-boomers and the search for security is not something understood 
readily by Generations X or Y. The message from Alistair Leathwood, Managing Director 
of FreshMinds Talent, is that the rules of engagement at work have changed: ‘Work 2.0 
signals a new social contract between employers and employees – one premised upon short-
term commitment, fl exibility and, most importantly, one where the employee’s loyalty to 
their employer is not expected to be any greater than what little the employer provides to 
its staff .’ 62  
 Although these generational characteristics are broad stereotypes and diff erences will 
clearly exist between individuals, they may help provide an understanding of contrasting work 
orientations and attitudes, job security and work/life balance; and with implications for social 
interactions, motivation, and styles of leadership and management. 63 
 Aside from Generations X and Y and the baby-boomers, as people live and work longer 
there will be a wider spread of age groups in the workforce. 
 The future of the workplace 
 As part of a round-table debate hosted by the Royal College of Art,  Gwyther comments on the 
future of the workplace. 
 The idea of the workplace is in a state of fl ux, which is down to a variety of factors: cost, car-
bon, technology, sustainability and culture. People still accept that it’s very important for an 
organisation to have a clear defi nition of what it is and how to go effi  ciently about achieving 
its aims, but how does the working environment play its part? The workplace is becoming 
more fragmented – people aren’t working together under the same roof as they were 20 years 
ago. What eff ect will that have on the culture of an organisation? Is it a weakness that people 
aren’t communicating face to face on a regular basis? 64 
 Topics in subsequent chapters will discuss further the changing nature and structure of work 
organisations, employment and social interactions. 65 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 The rapidly changing nature of employment demands new ways of looking at the world of work organisations. 
Traditional management models are completely outdated and should no longer form part of classroom discussion. 
 What do YOU think? How would YOU present a convincing counterargument?

CHAPTER 3 THE ORGANISATIONAL ENVIRONMENT
 Ten key points to remember 
  1   Applications of organisational behaviour and process of management take place not in a vac-
uum but within the context of an organisational setting. 
  2  Organisations are set up to serve a variety of purposes and needs. Common features in any 
organisation are people, objectives, structure and management. 
  3   Organisations can be viewed as open systems with sub-systems of task, technology, structure, 
people and management in interaction with the external environment. 
  4  Whatever the nature of the formal structure, an informal organisation will always be present 
and arises from the interactions of people, their psychological and social needs. 
  5  The informal organisation serves a number of important functions and has a signiﬁ cant inﬂ u-
ence on the morale, motivation, job satisfaction and performance of staﬀ . 
  6   Conﬂ ict is a reality of management and organisational behaviour. There are contrasting per-
spectives of conﬂ ict and it can be seen to have both positive and negative outcomes. 
  7  Stress at work is a potential source of mental and physical ill-health. However, a certain amount 
of pressure may arguably help promote a higher level of performance. 
  8  The eﬀ ective management of both conﬂ ict and stress demands a supportive work environ-
ment, skilled managers and a climate of mutual trust, respect and consideration. 
  9  Increasing attention is focused on the role organisations play in the lives of staﬀ  and with 
broader concerns for the work/life balance and for meaning in people’s lives. 
  10   It is important to be aware of the changing nature of the workforce of the future, including the 
signiﬁ cance of generation and age gaps.  
  1  How would you deﬁ ne an organisation and why do work organisations exist? 
  2  Discuss critically the extent to which diﬀ erences among various organisations limit the value of the study of 
management and organisational behaviour.

 The issue of Third World poverty is one that is rarely 
far from Western headlines, sometimes as the result 
of a particular humanitarian crisis or natural disaster, 
but often in association with debates about the eﬀ ects 
of globalisation, and in particular the impact of global 
business activities on individuals and communities in 
poor countries. It is an issue that inspires heated argu-
ment, as well as demands for money, or action, or both. 
Discussion of the trading position of Third World coun-
tries in a global context often tends to focus on the 
behaviour of speciﬁ c business organisations and the 
‘ethical’ status of their activities in poorer parts of the 
world. The high-street fashion chains are frequently in 
the ﬁ ring line about subcontracting their manufacturing 
operations to exploitative or irresponsible local employ-
ers, and the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory near 
Dhaka, Bangladesh, in April 2013, which left over 1,000 
of its workers dead and another 2,500 injured, propelled 
this issue into the headlines. 66 Some participants in the 
debate question whether business can ever truly be 
‘ethical’ because its very existence depends upon acts of 
exploitation. So can business ever really help improve 
the condition of poor people in developing countries? 
 When considering such issues, it is important to 
remember that poverty is not the same thing as help-
lessness. The development of the Grameen Bank, a 
 Bangladeshi banking business, illustrates one way in 
which ingenuity coupled with enterprise can present an 
alternative to charity and government aid as a route out 
of poverty. 
 Why banks are important to the poor 
 The development of any successful enterprise relies not 
only on the ingenuity, creativity and hard work of the 
individual entrepreneur, but also on a number of social 
and economic preconditions, including such things as 
property rights and the ability to amass or borrow capital 
for investment in equipment and materials.  67 Borrow-
ing power among the poor is very limited, as they are 
unlikely to be able to provide adequate security for loans 
from a commercial lending institution such as a bank. 
Without the ability to purchase the tools of their trade or 
raw materials, many individual workers remain depend-
ent upon friends, family, moneylenders or employers to 
loan them what they need, often at extortionate rates 
and at the risk of physical violence if repayments are 
not made on time. Poor workers are therefore generally 
unable to amass suﬃ  cient funds to become independent 
economic operators. This situation of dependency upon 
an employer or other intermediary for both paid work 
and the means to do the work is often described as ‘debt 
bondage’ or ‘debt peonage’. The eﬀ ect of such structures 
is often to ensure that the poorest in society remain 
unable, by their own eﬀ orts, to break free from a form 
of servitude that stiﬂ es more general economic growth.  
 Mohammed Yunus and the Grameen Bank 
 Traditional banks developed from places where rich 
people were able to deposit their money safely, into 
commercial institutions where customers’ money is used 
to make loans to other customers. In the earlier stages 
of their development they competed for the business of 
large customers such as companies and wealthy individ-
uals, since these were low-risk borrowers and provided 
high-growth prospects. Until the standardisation and 
automation of many banking operations, most working-
class people in developed economies did not have ready 
access to banking services. For poor people in develop-
ing countries, access to commercial banking services, 
including loans, remains a remote prospect indeed.

 Grameen Bank: a business that really helps the poor

Part 1  The organisational setting
104
Mohammed Yunus is a Bangladeshi economist who, 
after studying and working in the USA, returned home 
to become an economics professor at the University 
of Chittagong. He became familiar with the problems 
of poor local people, mainly women, in his lunchtime 
strolls around the city of Dhaka, and realised that many 
of the people he met would be greatly helped by the 
injections of very small amounts of capital, as little 
as $US1–2. He developed the idea of a specific type 
of what is usually termed ‘microcredit’, and in 1976, 
using $26 of his own money, began to make very small 
loans to poor local women so that they could invest 
in animals or materials that would enable them to 
make money. Such tiny loans were out of the question 
for standard commercial banks because of the high 
administrative costs relative to the investment, the lack 
of loan security and impossibility of proper credit ref-
erencing. Thus he invented a new type of organisation: 
a low-cost, local operation that runs from the homes 
and community centres of the village (grameen liter-
ally means ‘village’). The loans are unsecured so rely on 
local knowledge and trust, and need to be very pre-
cisely targeted. Both the investors and the creditors of 
Grameen Bank know each other, and members meet 
regularly to monitor the progress of business, includ-
ing loan repayments. Social capital is the mainstay of 
the banks, and borrowers are highly involved in loan 
decisions and the general operation of the banks. This 
social nexus leads to a very unusual feature of the 
banks, which is their policy of making loans only to the 
very poor, and, in the vast majority of cases, to women, 
who are generally more trustworthy in their handling 
of money than men. Yunus believes that this type of 
credit can lead to significant change in the status of 
poor individuals, and can help provide a route out of 
extreme poverty without reliance on external sources 
of money.
The first and foremost task of development is to turn 
on the engine of creativity . . . This is why Grameen 
Bank offers the poor not handouts or grants but 
credit – loans they must repay, with interest, through 
their own productive work. This dynamic makes 
Grameen Bank sustainable. Loan repayments supply 
funds for future loans, to the same individuals or to 
new bank members, in an ever-expanding cycle of 
economic growth. It also helps the poor demonstrate 
to themselves that they can change their world for the 
better – and it gives them the tools to do just that, for 
themselves . . . To me, the essence of development 
is changing the quality of life of the bottom half of 
the population. And that . . . must also include the 
enabling environment that lets individuals explore 
their own creative potential.68
The system proved highly successful; the 2012 annual 
report recorded 2,567 branches throughout Bangla-
desh, with over 8.3 million members; the overwhelming 
majority (96 per cent) of the borrowers were women.69 
Yunus himself was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his 
anti-poverty work in 2006.
Growth and change
The Grameen business model, small-scale, local and 
trust-based with a focus on helping the poorest mem-
bers of a community, has inspired many other micro-
credit organisations worldwide – for example, FINCA 
(the Foundation for International Community Assis-
tance), which took root in Latin America during the 
1980s.70 However, the schemes are not beyond criticism, 
and some commentators see the structure as a form of 
social control. A political row between the Bangladeshi 
prime minister and Yunus about the governance of the 
bank led to a legal challenge to his continuation as man-
aging director (a court found that he had exceeded the 
official retirement age) and he resigned from the bank 
in May 2011.
Despite this, Yunus remains actively involved with 
many offshoot organisations that are linked to the 
­Grameen philosophy, but independent of the bank itself. 
One such is Grameenphone, which initially enabled 
local women to set themselves up as ‘village phone 
ladies’ by purchasing a mobile phone with a Grameen 
Bank loan, and then renting it out for local use. From 
its inception in 1997, this initiative has brought com-
munication ­technology to rural areas that are otherwise 
largely isolated; villagers can make contact with friends

Chapter 3  The organisational environment
and relatives, but also with hospitals and other services. 
It has also improved the market position of Grameen-
phone customers who are engaged in other sorts of 
work. An example is described by Roland Buerk, in a 
BBC report on one of the Grameen ‘telephone ladies’, 
Roshinara Begum, in the Bangladeshi village of Kalima-
jani. One of her customers is local fish farmer, Moham-
med Abul Hashem, who uses the phone service to order 
food and supplies from the capital. He is quoted as 
explaining that:
If the phone wasn’t here then I’d have to travel to 
Dhaka. It’s a very long and unpleasant journey. Now 
I can use the phone I am saving time and it makes my 
business more competitive.71
Grameenphone entered into a profitable partner-
ship with the Norwegian telecoms company Telenor, 
which provides both the technical knowledge and the 
equipment to run the network successfully. It is now 
the largest mobile phone network in Bangladesh, with 
over 50 million subscribers and a network that reaches 
99 per cent of the population. It remains committed 
to supporting economic development in the area by 
increasing access to the Internet and other services:
Grameenphone also invests in various corporate social 
responsibility activities such as remote medical services 
and an innovative Internet school program that brings 
education to rural villages that were previously without 
access to teachers. Our commitment to empower and 
build societies is unwavering. We will continue to 
work to enhance the lives of our 50 million customers 
in Bangladesh and 160 million customers in Asia by 
focusing on our Internet for All mission and delivering 
tailored solutions that meet the needs of our users.72
Yunus believes that the financial crisis of 2007–8 has 
created a worldwide appetite for change and a grow-
ing interest in the notion of ‘social enterprise’. His skill 
and reputation are drawing global companies such as 
Danone, Adidas and BASF into joint ventures that com-
bine business with a social purpose, such as producing 
nutrient-rich yoghurt, affordable footwear and mos-
quito nets to combat malaria.73 His local initiative may, 
in the long run, have global consequences.
 Tasks
	 1	 Two of the significant features of the Grameen Bank are its focus on helping individuals to achieve 
independence and its strong preference for loans to women. What problems might this cause, and what 
risks does it take, in the communities and societies (mainly Islamic) where it operates?
	 2	 Read the section in the chapter about the idea of the ‘social enterprise’ and research some examples. 
Contrast this system of work organisation with that of a more traditional commercial business using the 
open-systems model of a business organisation (Figure 3.4), explaining how the difference might affect 
each aspect of the model.
	 3	 In 2006 the French dairy company Danone set up Grameen Danone Foods, a social business enterprise, 
which was a ‘unique initiative to bring daily healthy nutrition to low-income, nutritionally deprived 
populations in Bangladesh’74 by building factories in Bangladesh to manufacture the product. Carry out a 
PESTEL analysis for this initiative. Would you have made the same decision?
	 4	 How far do the concepts of the ‘formal’ and the ‘informal’ organisation (as illustrated in Figure 3.9 and 
Table 3.1) apply to this case?

Academic viewpoint
Below you will find the title and abstract of a recent article in an academic journal that explores a topic relevant to 
the chapters in Part 1.
Koles, B. and Nagy, P. ‘Virtual worlds as digital workplaces: Conceptualizing the affordances of virtual worlds 
to expand the social and professional spheres in organizations’, Organizational Psychology Review, vol. 4. no. 2, 
2014, pp. 175–95. doi: 10.1177/2041386613507074
Abstract
The primary aim of the current paper is to explore ways in which organizations can benefit from virtual environ-
ments to expand their social and professional spheres. Applying the theory of third places to virtual worlds, our 
conceptual model incorporates practical organizational affordances within three composite dimensions. First, we 
propose that through their unique, supportive and neutral environments, virtual worlds may reduce the prevalence 
of social hierarchies, via decreasing the emphasis on predetermined ranks, stereotypes, and cultural or geographic 
variation. Second, we posit that via encouraging open communication within the form of synchronous and real-time 
interactions, virtual worlds enable efficient teamwork and collaborative learning. Finally, we emphasize that these 
friendly, secure, and supportive environments may contribute to the reduction of certain work-related stressors, and 
in turn promote professional development activities. We conclude by discussing practical implications and future 
research directions.

Part 1  The organisational setting

Commentary
The authors start by noting that rapid technological 
advancements and their widespread adoption means 
that today’s work organisations are increasingly com-
plex, fragmented and decentralised. This poses major 
challenges for management. They also note that while 
organisations have often started to use social networks 
(Facebook, Twitter, etc.) as tools for communication 
and management, they have generally been slow to 
create full-scale virtual worlds or ‘third spaces’ – neu-
tral areas remote from both work and home that are 
readily accessible, allow social exchange between highly 
diverse individuals and that are characterised by fun and 
playfulness. Their study seeks to apply the main princi-
ples of virtual worlds to work organisations. They con-
clude that the levelling, ‘safe’ and relatively stress-free 
environment of virtual worlds could be highly beneficial 
to the management of today’s organisation, particularly 
where people work across a variety of cultures, social 
groups and time zones.
The article might prompt you to consider 
some of the following questions.
● The authors suggest that virtual worlds can break 
down many of the barriers of social difference. To 
what extent do you agree? What new social divisions 
might use of a virtual world create, and how?
● The psychological effects of participation in virtual 
worlds are viewed by the authors as stress reducing 
and positive. Do you think this is always the case? 
What problems might result from being connected

Part 1 Case study
Indian Railways: lifeline to the nation
On 16 April 1853, and to the reverberations of a 21-gun 
salute, a 14-carriage railway train steamed out of Bori 
Bunder station in Bombay (Mumbai) to carry its 400 
passengers the 21 miles (34 km) to nearby Thane. This 
was the inaugural journey on a railway system that, over 
the last 160 years, has grown into an operation that 
transports almost 23 million passengers around India – 
every day. This astonishing number of journeys is made 
possible by a network connecting over 7,000 stations 
by 64,600 km of track, served by over 9,500 locomo-
tive engines and approximately 2.4 million wagons. The 
system also carries over 1,000 million tonnes of freight 
around the country annually. No wonder Indian Rail-
ways is known as the ‘lifeline to the nation’.1
Hooking up the lifeline
As in England, where the railway system had its ori-
gins, railways in India were initially built rapidly but 
piecemeal by private companies. Yet their potential to 
transform and unify this diverse country of (now) well 
over 1,200 million people in 29 states with 15 official  
languages (excluding English)2 was realised by Madhav 
Rao, an Indian Chief Minister of State, towards the end 
of the nineteenth century:
What a glorious change the Railway has made in 
long and neglected India! . . . Populations which had 
been isolated for unmeasured ages, now easily mingle 
in civilised confusion. In my various long journeys it has 
repeatedly struck me that if India is to become a homo-
geneous nation, and is ever to achieve solidarity, it must 
be by means of the Railways as a means of transport, 
and by means of the English language as a medium of 
communication.3
In 1924 the entire network, including its construc-
tion, operation and financing, was brought under the 
control of the British Indian government, paving the 
way for its nationalisation in 1951 just four years after 
Indian independence. It remains a state-run public util-
ity monopoly, but one of such significance that it has its 
own government ministry (run by a government minis-
ter and two ministers of state) and a Railway Board; and 
it has its own annual budget, which is presented to the 
Indian Parliament independently of the main national 
government budget.
Indian Railways’ structure can be described as 
rational and hierarchical (see the figure). The main 
operation of running the seventeen geographic zones 

109
Chapter 3  The organisational environment
(their track, locomotives, stations, signalling, passenger 
and freight services, as well as the stations’ finances and 
personnel) falls to zone general managers who report to 
the Railway Board; and the zones are further split into 
seventy-one divisions, each headed by a divisional rail-
way manager who reports to the relevant zone’s general 
manager. Further down the hierarchy, each station is in 
the care of a station manager. In addition to the zone 
general managers, there are general managers in charge 
of the main production units (PUs), which include such 
things as locomotive construction workshops, coach 
and wheel factories, and rolling stock modernisation 
works. More general managers are responsible for 
the electrification project and new line construction. 
A further key section, headed by a director-general, is 
the Railway Staff College. Finally, there is a collection 
of fifteen or more public sector undertakings (PSUs) – 
semi-autonomous operations which, while still under 
the control of the Ministry and Board, focus on certain 
ancillary commercial activities such as catering and 
tourism, engineering consultancy, information systems 
and software design, and freight logistics. In many cases 
the PSUs operate with private investment in the form 
of private  – public partnerships, and sell their exper-
tise commercially to other businesses – for instance, the 
leasing and export of locomotives to railway systems 
worldwide. The apparent simplicity and rationality of 
the structure therefore conceals a plethora of differing 
activities, skills and operating conditions, not to men-
tion geographic, linguistic and cultural ones.
A country within a country
As we have already seen, the whole organisation is char-
acterised by a collection of mind-boggling statistics, 
and when it comes to the staff aspects they are no less 
impressive. Indian Railways has around 1.3 million regu-
lar employees, together with 300,000 or so casual work-
ers. The management of the human side of the business 
is therefore quite a challenge, and one that rests on the 
shoulders of the relatively small Indian Railways Person-
nel Service (IRPS), which comprises 320 or so profes-
sionals. They are organised to support the numerous 
zones, divisions and production units of Indian Railways’ 
structure, and are responsible for a number of key activ-
ities, namely:
● Establishment and personnel management
● Industrial relations
● Administration of labour laws
● Administration of welfare schemes
● Legal matters pertaining to staff and personnel
● Human resource development
● Pension affairs of more than a million retired railway 
personnel
An idea of the scale of the task can be gleaned from the 
experience of one IRPS officer who commented that, 
early in her career, she attended a training course along 
with professionals from other organisations, both public 
and private sector:
we were asked to introduce ourselves, our position and 
the number of staff we were responsible for. I was one 
of the last few and when I heard the positions and the 
number of staff my fellow HR professionals in both the 
sectors were responsible for, I was surprised. And when 
I said I was merely a junior personnel officer for the 
Indian railways responsible for a small division com-
prising 60,000 staff, everyone else was stunned and 
asked if this was really true.4
Regular staff are organised into four major groupings in 
descending order of seniority: A, B, C and D. Groups A 
and B are the managerial staff, and account for 1.3 per 
India’s lifeline to the nation

Chapter 3  The organisational environment
cent of the total employed. The IRPS forms part of this 
layer. Group C staff are by far the largest cohort, and 
account for around 81 per cent of regular employees, 
with group D containing the remainder. In groups C and 
D, two-thirds are employed in the operational side of 
the organisation and one-third are artisans and work-
shop employees. One particular group within the organ-
isation is the security-cum-police force, the Railway 
Protection Special Force, which has its own uniform and 
quasi-legal powers. They are charged with maintaining 
law and order on trains and railway premises, as well 
as the overall security of the assets and the staff. This is 
not the only way in which Indian Railways differs from 
other employers. The organisation owns and maintains 
schools for the children of railway employees. It runs its 
own hospitals, banks, co-operative ­societies, clubs and 
housing – all available to Indian Railways  workers 
and their families. It runs holiday homes, sports clubs 
and handicraft centres (where railway workers’ families 
can learn crafts and earn additional income). Indian Rail-
ways prides itself on its support for competitive sports at 
national and international level – Assistant Commercial 
Manager Sushil Kumar was a wrestling silver medallist 
and national flag bearer at the 2012 London Olympic 
Games. Together with significant job security and rela-
tively generous pension arrangements, these features 
make a job with Indian Railways among the most sought 
after in the country. Once in, an employee has access to 
such a wide range of benefits that the 1.3 million and 
their families are often said to be living in a ‘country 
within a country’.
Getting on board
Recruitment into such desirable employment is, as 
might be expected of a governmental organisation, 
a highly formalised process. For group D person-
nel, recruitment is through national Railway Selection 
Boards, which co-operate with local employment 
exchanges to find and select suitable candidates. Group 
C staff are recruited through one of nineteen Railway 
Recruitment Boards, which come under the control 
of an overarching Railway Recruitment Control Board 
that monitors standards and identifies staffing and skill 
requirements at national level. This process involves 
passing formal examinations, and in 2010–11 almost 
6,000 candidates were selected by these boards for 
deployment into relevant posts.
At the higher levels, group A and B staff are also 
selected through competitive examination, but, as the 
Railway is a government agency, this process is run by 
the national Union Public Service Commission, which 
recruits all Indian civil servants. Group A and B staff are 
termed ‘gazetted’, meaning that notice of their selection 
has appeared in the nationally published list (or gazette) 
of public servants. Recruitment to the PSUs is often by 
secondment of staff from existing zones and divisions, 
and on a fixed-term basis.
At whatever level, the process additionally includes a 
full medical examination by doctors of the Indian Rail-
ways Hospitals service before staff can be appointed; 
information is also sought about the background and 
character of potential appointees. In the vast majority of 
cases there is a probationary period of one year before 
appointments are confirmed. Induction and initial 
training is compulsory, and there is a strong emphasis 
on service and acceptance of the hierarchy and gen-
eral regulations governing Indian Railways employee 
behaviour. For example, railway personnel are expected 
to be flexible in the sense of being prepared to spend 
time away from home and family; dutiful in the sense of 
having regard always for the safety and security of the 
railway, fellow staff and passengers; and have an ‘inner 
discipline’ to enable them to serve the needs of a differ-
ing people in a range of circumstances, but always in a 
responsible manner.
In return, as has been noted, both the employment 
security and benefits are generous – free rail passes and 
concessionary fares for family members being seen 
as highly attractive features of the package – although 
salaries and wages are usually lower than their private-
sector equivalents.
The terms, conditions and pay structures that apply 
to Indian Railways staff are many and complex. Hours 
of work are codified in an annex to an Act of Parlia-
ment as the ‘Railway Servants (Hours of Employment) 
Rules 1961’ and classify types of work according to a set 
of parameters as ‘continuous’, ‘essentially intermittent’ 
(when an employee may be on duty but not actively 
working the whole time) or ‘intensive (involving strenu-
ous physical activity or periods of high mental concen-
tration), and prescribes the weekly maximum hours 
accordingly. Managers and certain others are ‘excluded’ 
from these maxima, as are the Railway Special Protec-
tion Force. A government Pay Commission sets and, 
periodically, reviews the pay structure and levels, and all 
employees are placed on a pay scale, receiving annual 
increments until they reach the upper limit of their 
scale. There are additional allowances payable (e.g. for 
night duty, and working in inhospitable or expensive 
locations), annual leave entitlements are specified, as 
are retirement and pension conditions and insurance 
and death-in-service benefits. The ‘Establishment Rules’

also extend to matters of conduct and discipline, and so 
many aspects of management are governed by railway 
law. Staff are paid monthly, and gazetted staff via bank 
transfer, although others can choose to be paid in cash. 
As can be imagined, running a payroll for 1.3 million 
people with the variety of terms and allowances in force 
is an enormous challenge, and one that the Ministry of 
Railways is currently proposing to outsource to a private 
contractor. Unsurprisingly, there seems to be limited 
enthusiasm among railway staff for the idea of outsourc-
ing in this way.5
In a democracy such as India, the freedom of work-
ers to organise themselves to represent their interests 
to management is an important one. Indian Railways 
recognises two main trade unions at national level – the 
National Federation of Indian Railwaymen and the All 
India Railway Federation. Contact between manage-
ment and organised labour is channelled through a twin 
system: the Permanent Negotiating Machinery (PNM) 
and the Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM). These oper-
ate at divisional and board level, but a governmentally 
appointed tribunal will hear cases that cannot be resolved 
by the machinery. These institutions consult and bargain 
over matters relating to pay and allowances, hours of 
work, leave entitlements and the classification of grades 
of workers, but are restricted to considering general prin-
ciples and do not handle individual cases or grievances. 
Collective grievances (disputes), however, are part of their 
remit, and can be highly contentious. In 1960 there was 
a strike over pay; in 1968 another over the operation of 
the JCM; and in 1974 a strike of railwaymen contributed 
to a landslide electoral defeat for the governing Congress 
Party. However, disputes in 1978 and 1997 that threat-
ened to result in strikes were resolved by the negotiating 
mechanisms, signalling a more co-operative period in 
the organisation’s history that has since endured. It was, 
perhaps, the outcome of a sea-change in economic and 
political life that challenged the very basis of Indian Rail-
ways’ existence in the last decades of the twentieth cen-
tury – the move towards global economic liberalisation.
Back on the rails
Indian Railways has not always been a profitable opera-
tion. In 2001 the government was considering privati-
sation as a drastic remedy to a period of sustained and 
significant losses by the organisation, very much in 
tune with the economic liberalism sweeping the globe 
in the wake of the Regan and Thatcher governments 
in the West. The espousal of free-market, neo-liberal 
economic policies in the UK and elsewhere resulted in 
the privatisation of many state-owned organisations 
such as telecommunications, energy suppliers and, to 
a limited extent, transportation. If it were to survive as 
a state-run enterprise, Indian Railways had to change, 
and so a strategy of modernisation, in terms of manage-
ment style and culture as well as the physical asset, was 
needed to bring the organisation into the twenty-first 
century and ensure its long-term viability.
The business needed to become more customer orien-
tated, to increase its revenue from both freight and passen-
ger services, and to reduce its liabilities, of which the salary 
bill formed a large part. It therefore embarked on projects 
to upgrade the system – track electrification, computeri-
sation of ticketing, mechanisation of track maintenance – 
and at the same time implement a planned reduction in 
staff numbers. In 2000–1 Indian Railways had almost 1.55 
million regular staff on the payroll, a figure that has been 
reduced by around 16 per cent over a twelve-year period.6 
Average pay, however, has increased, and the use of pro-
ductivity-linked bonuses is part of a strategy to improve 
efficiency within the service. A system of full-blown per-
formance-related pay (PRP) is significantly different from 
the established scales and grades approach so familiar in 
public-sector organisations, and as yet moves to introduce 
PRP are in their early stages.
All of this change relied heavily on the co-operation 
of staff, both collectively in terms of positive trade union 
relations and individually in terms of their willingness 
and capacity to upgrade their skills. This could only be 
achieved through training and development.
Training and development for railway staff is exten-
sive. In addition to the compulsory induction pro-
gramme already mentioned, there is a wide variety of 
types of training available at all levels. For the managers 
and officers (the gazetted staff), seven Centralised Train-
ing Institutes cover specialisms such as engineering of 
all types (civil, mechanical, electrical), signalling and tel-
ecommunications, transport management and, at a spe-
cific centre, training for the Railway Protection Force. The 
spectacularly beautiful Railway Staff College at Vadodara 
in Gujarat7 specialises in both general and strategic 
management, sometimes in collaboration with interna-
tionally reputed business and management providers 
from outside India. A further seven centralised and 300 
regional training centres exist to provide routine basic 
and refresher training, with a strong emphasis on safety 
to technical non-gazetted staff such as drivers, guards 
and motormen. Once again, the size of the operation is 
impressive: 3.4 million non-gazetted and 8,400 gazet-
ted staff benefited from Indian Railways training during 
2012–13.8 Training needs, beyond the routine, are identi-
fied during annual appraisals, and railway workers appear 

113
Chapter 3  The organisational environment
to recognise that the number of training programmes 
has increased in recent years.9 Efforts are made to test 
the effectiveness of training programmes by examination 
(both written and practical) or simulations. There are also 
moves to encourage local, continuous training within the 
zones by equipping qualified and experienced staff with 
training skills via a ‘train the trainer’ initiative.
Clearly, then, training and development is crucial to 
achieving the turnaround necessary to keep Indian Rail-
ways on track in the twenty-first century:
Human resource development strategies on IR have 
been re-oriented towards enhancing the competitive-
ness of the Railways organisations in the context of 
internal and external changes in the environment. In 
addition to in-house training, railwaymen are being 
provided specialized training in other institutions in 
India and abroad. Railway employees are also encour-
aged to enhance their knowledge and skills by acquir-
ing higher educational qualifications in the specified 
areas relevant to their work by granting incentives 
to them. Efforts are being made to improve the basic 
infrastructure for training to provide structured train-
ing programme in improved learning environment. 
Manpower planning system has been redesigned to 
regulate manpower intake with reference to emerging 
business needs and financial viability of the system.10
In the last years of the previous millennium, Indian Rail-
ways was a loss-making giant. Today, and for the last 
ten years, it has been a profitable and internationally 
renowned engine of national economic growth – and 
one of the largest commercially operating employers in 
the world.
Tasks
1.	 How would you go about researching the organisational behaviour aspects of Indian Railways? Base your 
answer around the concept of organisational behaviour as a multidisciplinary approach (see Figure 1.1) 
and explain how you would gather information for each aspect of this approach.
2.	 How and how far do you think Indian Railways has been affected by the changing nature of work and work 
organisation since the year 2000? What are the implications for managers, and how should these implica-
tions be integrated into managerial training?
3.	 What does the case of Indian Railways reveal about Indian national culture? Use the Hofstede framework 
to develop your analysis.
4.	 Chapter 3 suggests that organisations can be classified according to major purpose. Can Indian Railways 
be classified in this way? Explain your answer with reference to all ten types of organisational purpose out-
lined. Which do you think is the best fit for Indian Railways, and why?
5.	 Using the PESTEL framework (see Figure  3.7), identify significant contextual issues for Indian Railways 
under each heading. How might the organisation plan to address these issues? To what extent does the 
framework help to provide an integrated plan?

 the individual 

 the organisation is a collection of individuals with their own 
perceptions, feelings and attitudes. our unique diff erent characteristics 
and attributes shape our values and what we give and expect to receive 
from working. people are not homogeneous, and individual diff erences 
are the basis of diversity. eff ective managers need to match the needs 
and expectations of the individual with the requirements of the 
organisation. 
 Learning outcomes 
 After completing this chapter you should have enhanced your ability to: 
 ●  assess the application of personality studies to the work organisation; 
 ●  explain the nature of ability and emotional intelligence; 
 ●  detail the nature and signifi cance of attitudes to the workplace; 
 ●  assess the value of psychometric tests and assessments; 
 ●  explore the nature and importance of diversity management; 
 ●  evaluate the business case for diversity and the management of diversity; 
 ●  focus on valuing individual diff erences and factors aff ecting organisational 
performance. 
 CHAPTER 4 
 Individual diff erences and diversity 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 you cannot expect to work well with other people unless you are fully aware of your own individual differences and 
characteristic features. successful understanding and management of interpersonal relationships can only start with 
an honest individual self-analysis. 
 To what extent do YOU agree with this contention? How well do YOU know YOURSELF – both the ‘good’ and the ‘bad’? 

Chapter 4  Individual differences and diversity
117
Recognition of individuality
The individual is a central feature of organisational behaviour. Organisations are made up 
of their individual members, whether acting in isolation or as part of a group, in response to 
expectations of the organisation, or as a result of the influences of the external environment.
Individual differences can foster creativity, enjoyment and satisfaction at work but can also 
be the potential for conflict and frustration. Managers are required to be competent at selecting 
and developing individuals who will be valuable to the organisation. They need to be observant 
about the individuals who are capable of effective performance, have the potential for devel-
opment and work well with other people within the context of the organisation as a whole. 
Effective management of people requires not only an understanding of individual employees, 
but also recognition of the culture of the organisation. What is expected and accepted in one 
work situation may not be the same in another. For instance, creativity and individuality may 
be encouraged in one organisation but undermined by bureaucracy in another. Managers also 
need to be able to recognise, respect and value individual difference and be sensitive to contrast-
ing needs. Finally, managers need to know themselves and understand their uniqueness and the 
impact of their own personality on others.
Managing relationships at work has always been a key skill, but the speed of change in 
organisations and the external environment places increasing pressure on individuals at work. 
Sensitivity to individual needs and differences, especially in terms of their resilience, becomes 
particularly significant when organisations embark on change initiatives. When change 
appears to be externally imposed, the management of people takes on a different dimension 
in terms of the sensitivity required. Such changes may lead to new mindsets, attitudes and 
perceptions that enable people to cope with and adjust to the different world. Managers will 
be expected to understand the strains employees feel during times of change, but at the same 
time deal with their own levels of stress.
How do individuals differ?
Our sense of self is shaped by inherited characteristics and by influences in our social environ-
ment. The impact of early family life and the country in which we live have a significant part 
to play in our identity. Most social scientists would agree that both inherited and environmen-
tal factors are important in our development, and the way these factors interact is the key to 
our adult personality. However, scientists differ with regard to the weight they place on these 
factors – some believing that our personality is heavily influenced by our inherited character-
istics and will never change, others believing the reverse.
But first, what are the differences among individuals? These include:
● ethnic origin
● physique
● gender
● early family experiences
● social and cultural factors
● national culture
● motivation
● attitudes
● personality traits and types
● intelligence and abilities
● perception.
Developmental influences such as ageing and health may also arguably affect personality 
characteristics.

118
part 2 the IndIvIdual
 Some of these characteristics are shared with others – for example, individuals who are 
from the same ethnic group or who have the same ability levels or who share similar physi-
cal attributes such as short-sightedness. But our uniqueness stems from the dynamic ways in 
which these inherited and environmental factors combine and interact. Central to the way in 
which it is possible to diff erentiate between individuals, including their behaviour, actions and 
performance at work, is an understanding of personality: the heart of individual diff erences. 
 The functions of attitudes are discussed later in this chapter. An understanding of the way 
people learn is fundamental to an appreciation of individual diff erences and is considered in 
 Chapter  5 . The process of perception and communications is examined in  Chapter  6 . All con-
tribute to a greater understanding of self and others. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Individual differences and behaviour are riddled with complexity and contradictions. frustrations and conflicts are 
inevitable. Managers should just accept the reality of the situation and concentrate on the work that needs to be 
done. 
 As a manager what would be YOUR reaction to this contention? 
 Personality 
 Personality may be viewed as consisting of stable characteristics that explain why a person 
behaves in a particular way. So, for instance, independence, conscientiousness, agreeableness 
and self-control are examples of personality characteristics. However, it is only when we see/
hear/observe a person that we can gain an understanding of their personality. For example, a 
person who is independent may show that characteristic by displaying a strong sense of self-
suffi  ciency. We would expect the person to take the initiative and not depend on other people. 
Furthermore, if the characteristic is ‘stable’ we can rely on this being a consistent part of the 
person’s behaviour. We would be surprised if the person one day demonstrated autonomy and 
initiative and the next withdrew and delayed any decisions. 
 There are times when we might be surprised by somebody’s behaviour and feel they are 
‘acting out of character’. Of course this would be known only if we had an understanding 
of their ‘typical behaviour’ in the fi rst place. Individuals may exaggerate or suppress certain 
personality traits if, for example, they are under stress or infl uenced by drink/drugs. Managers 
need to learn the art of ‘reading’ and understanding people’s behaviour in order to manage 
relationships eff ectively. 
 Nomothetic and idiographic approaches 
 Broadly speaking, personality studies can be divided into two main approaches, labelled 
nomothetic and idiographic. 
 The  nomothetic approach is a measurable and specifi c perspective that looks at the iden-
tifi cation of traits and personality as a collection of characteristics. These characteristics are 
ones that can be described, identifi ed and measured, and therefore can be subjected to obser-
vation and tests. This perspective is especially helpful for managers when they are involved in 
the selection, training and development of individuals. Nomothetic approaches tend to view 
environmental and social infl uences as minimal and view personality as consistent, largely 
inherited and resistant to change. Although they would not diminish the diffi  culties that meas-
uring personality brings, nomothetic approaches would claim that it is possible to measure 
and predict the ways in which personality types would behave, given certain circumstances. 

Chapter 4  Individual differences and diversity
119
Nomothetic researchers closely align themselves to studies that are ‘scientific’ in a positiv-
istic sense. (The term ‘positivism’ refers to the branch of science that is exclusively based on 
the objective collection of observable data – data that are beyond question.) Such an approach 
transfers methods used in natural sciences to the social world. Some psychologists are inter-
ested in describing and measuring characteristics and comparing individuals’ scores. Does this 
person exhibit more or less than ‘average’ of this particular trait? Being able to predict behav-
iour is a major aim and outcome of this approach.
The idiographic approach is a holistic and dynamic perspective that insists that managers 
take into account a ‘whole’ understanding of the individual at work. This may also require 
going beyond the study of pure psychology to an understanding of the societal context in 
which the person lives. These are called idiographic approaches and are particularly pertinent 
in understanding motivation, career development and team relationships.
Idiographic approaches are concerned with understanding the uniqueness of individuals 
and the development of the self-concept. They regard personality development as a process 
that is open to change. They regard individuals as responding to the environment and people 
around them and see the dynamics of the interactions as playing a critical part in shaping 
personality. The measurement of traits is seen as largely inappropriate, in that one person’s 
responses may not be comparable with another’s. They suggest that personality assessment 
is not a valid method of understanding the unique ways in which a person understands and 
responds to the world. The depth and richness of a person’s personality cannot be revealed in 
superficial paper-and-pencil questionnaires. Furthermore, the categories defined by psycholo-
gists are too narrow in scope and depth.
Theory and the world of work
The application of theory to the world of work is not always easy and some find the process 
confusing when theory does not match with their experiences. Psychological investigations 
emphasise the complexity and variety of individual behaviour, and insist that simple answers 
and explanations are generally inadequate. The study of personality provides an excellent 
example of some of the complexities involved in applying psychological theory in practice.
Consider two individuals who share similar characteristics. They are both 24 years old 
and have lived in the same area; both have a first-class honours degree in pharmacy and they 
have identical personality assessment profiles. However, we would still predict individual dif-
ferences with regard to, for example, their attitude and performance in the workplace. The 
complexities of the process pose a number of questions that interest psychologists and evoke 
different responses.

Part 2  The individual
Uniqueness and similarities
Tables 4.1 and 4.2 focus on two major issues of prime importance in the study of personality. 
Firstly, is personality a constant throughout our lifetime, which remains resistant to change 
and circumstances? Secondly, to what extent can we measure and compare individuals on the 
basis of their personality? This second question assumes that it is possible to distinguish per-
sonality characteristics in the first place. Trying to make sense of the nature of personality 
has resulted in a prolific number of theories, with some psychologists focusing solely on the 
unique make-up of individuals, others drawing comparisons between individuals or looking 
for broad similarities in aspirations and goals.
In a work context we tend to be more interested in understanding ‘what’ an individual’s per-
sonality is rather than ‘why’ it is as it is. Furthermore, it is important to understand how various 
personality characteristics relate to performance at work. The idiographic approach enriches 
our understanding of ‘why’ and the nomothetic approach explores the ‘what’ of personality.
Environment is significant
Inherited characteristics are significant
Approach taken by idiographic theorists
Approach taken by nomothetic theorists
The personalities of the two pharmacists described above 
are the culmination of experiences. their personalities 
have been shaped by the people around them from their 
very earliest years. early family life – the relationship 
between family members, the size of the family, the 
rewards and punishments exercised by parents – would 
have had an influence on the type of person each is 
now. in other words, the environment and early learning 
experiences have significantly contributed to their 
personality development.
The pharmacists inherited a genetic make-up that 
would remain core and would be resistant to change. 
early experiences, while they may shape the person to 
a certain extent, do not alter the inherited make-up. 
intelligence, physical appearances and physiological 
reactions are ‘wired in’ from birth – the ‘core’ of the 
individual is a ‘given’.
Table 4.1  The role of early experiences – what is their impact?
No, personality is unique
Yes, there are identifiable traits
Approach taken by idiographic theorists
Approach taken by nomothetic theorists
Idiographic approaches do not believe it is possible to put 
personal characteristics to the test. our very uniqueness 
makes comparisons difficult, if not impossible. is it 
appropriate to consider the ‘strength’ of a trait? Our 
pharmacists may not always reveal their true ‘self’ – at 
times circumstances may force them to ‘mask’ their 
preferred ways of behaving. our pharmacists may not 
reliably report on their own behaviour or there may be 
a real difference between what they say and what others 
see. critics of questionnaires believe answering ‘set’ 
questions is ‘forcing’ responses to questions that may not 
be relevant. instead, it may be more appropriate to use 
open-ended techniques. this ensures that individuals 
use their own definitions and allows for greater 
understanding about their motivations and causes of 
behaviour.
Identifying an individual’s personality typically refers 
to distinguishing traits or types. personality traits are 
usually identified by what people do and the behaviour 
they exhibit, e.g. sociability. psychologists have designed 
questionnaires asking people to report on the way they 
feel or behave. they claim that this is a legitimate way of 
assessing personality. these self-reporting questionnaires 
would then be subject to quantitative methods. it is 
therefore possible to quantify the strength of a person’s 
trait and to enable comparisons to be made with others. 
such information then becomes a basis for prediction. 
for example, if a person has a high score on extroversion, 
it would be possible to predict the way in which the 
individual might behave in a given situation.

 The big fi ve personality factors 
 Identifi cation of personality traits has been a dominant subject of research in the UK and 
the USA. There is now a broad body of evidence that suggests that fi ve dimensions provide a 
common basis by which to capture distinct diff erences between people. These clusters of traits 
(not personality types) are known as the ‘big fi ve’ 1 and sometimes expressed in the acronym 
OCEAN (or sometimes CANEO): 
 O penness/closed-mindedness 
 C onscientiousness/heedlessness 
 E xtroversion/introversion 
 A greeableness/hostility 
 N euroticism/stability 
 The big fi ve and work performance 
 The big fi ve form the basis of standard personality questionnaires that determine positive or 
negative scores for each dimension. Results from a wide number of studies have shown that 
these factors can be identifi ed as being signifi cant in measuring the variation between people. 2 
Of these, conscientiousness has the highest positive link with high levels of job knowledge 
and performance across a range of occupations. 3 However, some researchers are critical of the 
descriptors used. 4 
 Bentall suggests they are ‘tainted by the investigators’ values’ and continues: ‘I suspect that 
most people will have a pretty clear idea of where they would like to fi nd themselves on the 
dimensions of neuroticism, extroversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness.’ He 
questions the ethical and political nature of the scales. 5 The relationship between personality 
and work performance is also questioned by  Robertson , who suggests that the only two of the 
fi ve dimensions that linked consistently with high levels of performance are conscientiousness 
and emotional stability. 6 
 Despite these reservations, the strength and value of the big fi ve model has been extolled in 
a review by  Lord and Rust, who conclude: 
   Indeed, the fi ve factor model has become the linchpin that holds personality assessment 
together, at least within the work context. Without it, how would we generalize with confi -
dence from the validity of one work-based instrument to that of another? Furthermore, the 
model links the study of assessment instruments within the HR fi eld to research in personality 
and related areas carried out within clinical and mainstream psychology fi elds in which the 
Big Five have also become dominant. 7 
 Support for the big fi ve is also provided by  Luthans and Youssef , who report that the personal-
ity traits have been found to be related strongly to performance and also to: 
 ●  individual-level outcomes such as happiness and physical and psychological health, spiritu-
ality and identity;  
 ●  interpersonal-level outcomes such as quality of relationships with peers, family and roman-
tic others; and 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 We know that every person is an individual in their own right, but many theories and models of organisational 
behaviour still appear to apply to people in general. rather than looking at similarities among people, we should be 
more concerned with the study of differences among individuals. 
 What are YOUR views? What do YOU believe is the value of theories or models of organisational behaviour? 

122
Part 2  The individual
● organisational or social-level outcomes such as occupational choice, satisfaction, perfor-
mance, community involvement, criminal activity and political ideology.8
Moutafi et al. undertook a study of 900 UK managers across ten organisations. Participants 
completed two personality tests (Revised NEO Personality Inventory and Myers–Briggs Type 
Indicator (MBTI)) and reported their managerial level in their organisation. Results showed 
that conscientiousness, extroversion and MBTI intuition were positively correlated with 
managerial level, and neuroticism, MBTI introversion and sensing were negatively correlated 
with managerial level. These findings attest to the utility of personality tests used within the 
occupational community, for selection and assessment of suitability for promotion to senior 
managerial roles.9
Hans Eysenck
Hans Eysenck believed that personality was largely inherited and that we are born with differ-
ing physiological tendencies. He identified two major individual differences – see Figure 4.2. 
Eysenck’s approach was influenced by the positivistic tradition, with his findings grounded in 
robust research. His aim was to produce objective evidence of personality differences using 
large samples of the population.10 The two dimensions define four distinct personality types:
● stable extroverts (sanguine), with traits such as being talkative, responsive, easygoing, lively, 
carefree;
● unstable extroverts (choleric), with traits such as being impulsive, changeable, excitable, 
restless;
● stable introverts (phlegmatic), with traits such as being calm, even-tempered, peaceful, 
thoughtful;
● unstable introverts (melancholic), with traits such as being anxious, moody, reserved, 
pessimistic.
Individuals in Eysenck’s theory could, therefore, be one of four main personality types. The 
type would lead to a predisposition of traits that would, itself, lead to the likelihood of certain 
behaviours. For instance, a person typed as an extrovert would predictably talk over things 
with someone to help them think it through, while an introvert would prefer to mull it over 
before talking about the issue. Eysenck developed an instrument to measure personality type 
called EPQ (Eysenck’s Personality Questionnaire).
Although Eysenck’s theory appears simplistic, it has an impressive amount of supporting 
research evidence. His approach has immediate appeal to managers in organisations who are 
concerned with predicting the future behaviour of their employees, either for selection or pro-
motion. Given the evidence that personality is a useful predictor of behaviour, it is not surpris-
ing that the use of psychometric tests has grown substantially over the past decade and that 
the majority of large companies use occupational tests.11 (Further information about testing is 
given later in this chapter.)

123
Raymond Cattell
Cattell’s work resembles Eysenck’s in the methods used to study personality. He used quantita-
tive, objective techniques in order to analyse his data and followed traditional scientific pro-
cedures in order to understand the basic dimensions of personality.12 He identified two main 
types of personality traits:
● surface traits that seem to cluster together consistently and are observable in behaviour, 
such as assertiveness;
● source traits, such as self-discipline, that can only be inferred and seem to underlie and 
determine the traits that are likely to ‘surface’ into behaviour.
Unlike Eysenck, Cattell did not ‘type’ individuals but used ‘traits’ as his main personality 
descriptor. They also differed with regard to the determinants of personality: Eysenck viewed 
the inherited physiological basis as the main determinant, whereas Cattell was more interested 
in taking social factors into account when understanding an individual’s personality. The orig-
inal work identified twelve source traits, or primary factors, but was revised to sixteen, which 
form the basis of the Cattell Sixteen Personality Factor (16PF) Questionnaire. Both theorists 
have contributed to a lively debate about personality structure and its measurement, and in 
doing so have advanced the selection techniques available to managers.13
Idiographic theoretical approaches
Idiographic approaches emphasise the development of the individual and of individuals’ views 
of themselves – their self-concept. Supporters of idiographic approaches are critical of the nomo-
thetic approach that attempts to categorise individuals on the basis of group data. They argue 
that the techniques used to collate the group data are questionable and the outcome inappropri-
ate to an understanding of personality. For the idiographic researchers, personality is expressed 
through the experiences and development of the individual. It cannot be understood outside a 
social context and has to be studied in the light of individuals’ own perceptions of their world.
Idiographic researchers would always take into account the social circumstances of the 
person, and in particular the relationships with others, family life and social conditions. In 
early childhood strong personal relationships and unconditional love are essential for later 
fulfilment and psychological growth. Carl Rogers’ theory claims that personality is embed-
ded within personal relationships. The process of becoming an adult requires the ability to 
give and receive unconditional regard – the warmth and respect for the person, who they are, 
regardless of how they behave.14 The phrase ‘the looking-glass self’ was first discussed in 1902 
by Cooley – by this he meant that we come to know ourselves through our relationship with 
others and their reactions to us. Our self-concept is shaped by how others respond to us.15
Erik Erikson
Erik Erikson’s theory is a good example of the idiographic approach. He viewed personality 
development as continuing throughout life, and was interested in the effect of experiences on the 
development of the self-concept and how different individuals resolved personal conflicts.16 Erikson 
recognised the importance of early childhood in establishing certain basic concepts of trust, auton-
omy and initiative, but also claimed that all stages of life produce different tensions and conflicts.
For Erikson, there are eight distinct stages of life, each of which produces different tensions 
and conflicts that have to be resolved (see Table 4.3). Successful resolution of these conflicts 
produces a healthy personality, whereas difficulties in earlier stages may produce problems

later on. Erikson’s theory not only makes considerable sense in terms of face validity (i.e. the 
‘it feels right’ factor), but also links with other research indicating that managers’ motivations 
and goals change with age (see also  Hunt, who identifi ed nine diff erent career/life stages). 17

 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 the academic study of personality, the idea of nomothetic and idiographic approaches and the work of well-known 
writers may be of interest in the classroom, but have limited meaning or value to the practical manager. 
 What is YOUR view? How would YOU attempt to justify the application of theory to the world of work? 
 Complementary approaches 
 Some researchers do not fi t easily into either of the two broad approaches of nomothetic or 
idiographic and have their own theories and models of personality development – for  example, 
the work of Carl Jung or the cognitive approach of George Kelly. 
 Carl Jung 
 Carl Jung’s theory is of particular signifi cance in that it bridges the psychoanalytic approach 
(of writers such as Sigmund Freud) with modern approaches of personality test design. His 
theory identifi es life energy as concerned with hopes and goals of the future and not just of the 
past. Jung describes three levels of personality: 
 ●  a conscious level (daily reality); 
 ●  an unconscious level (contains our unique complexes); 
 ●  a collective unconscious level (store of universal and evolutionary experiences). 
 According to Jung, people have a psychological preference for extroversion or introversion. 
This basic dichotomy is expanded into four additional factors, namely thinking, sensing, feel-
ing and intuition, which provide a matrix of four personality types: 
 Sensation-Thinking (ST) Sensation-Feeling (SF) 
 Intuition-Thinking (NT) Intuition-Feeling (NF) 18 

Chapter 4  Individual differences and diversity
125
The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator
Jung is probably best known for his constructs that form the foundation for the MBTI person-
ality indicator. The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)® assessment tool was designed by Isa-
bel Briggs Myers and Katherine Briggs, who applied the rigours of systematic testing to Jung’s 
personality functions and attitudes.19 Jung identified differences between individuals in terms 
of their libidinal energy that could flow outwards to the external world (extrovert) or inwards 
to their inner world (introvert). Personality differences would also be manifest through differ-
ing cognitive functions of thinking, feeling, sensation and intuition. The Myers–Briggs assess-
ment added a further dimension of style of living. The MBTI tool has promoted considerable 
research interest, particularly with regard to the correlation between personality type, occupa-
tions and management style (see Figure 4.3).
The MBTI assessment tool has been in and out of fashion over the years and there is con-
stant debate about its continuing relevance or usefulness. For example, Vernon maintains that 
Jung’s ideas have become an integral part of business and that many do not even realise they 
were his in the first place. Advocates of Jung’s analytical psychology believe his legacy is still 
underexploited and, despite its risks, MBTI is still the most popular non-clinical measure of 
personality type.20
Kelly’s personal construct theory
Kelly’s theory of personal constructs does not just consider personality development; it con-
siders the whole person in terms of their perceptions, attitudes and goals. Personality is the 
individual’s way of construing and experimenting with their world, and Kelly was critical of 
separating the study of personality from the ‘whole’ person.
The underlying theme of personal construct theory is that people organise their experiences 
with the world into conceptual classifications called constructs. Observation of the behaviour 
of other people leads to our hypotheses – personal constructs – about the social world. Based 
on perceptions of, and personal experiences with, their environment, each individual shapes 
their own unique set of constructs that are important to them. Kelly maintains that these con-
structs manifest themselves as polar opposites. We develop a wide range of constructs that we 
can challenge and change over time. How a person organises and prioritises their constructs 
influences their judgements, actions and decisions
Inherent differences in people’s personal constructs can lead to bias in research. Kelly devel-
oped the Repertory Grid in order to measure an individual’s construct of the world. Kelly was 
thus able to employ a clear and valid measure within an idiographic approach and the reper-
tory technique has become increasingly important as a research tool. It enables the person 
to use their own constructions of the world but in such a way that they are comparable and 
measurable.21

Part 2  The individual
Emotions at work
Traditionally, workplaces were seen as rational, logical places where emotions were excluded 
or seen in a negative light. Hochschild’s research describes the way in which some jobs require 
a display of certain emotions – especially those in the service industries, where customer care 
is inextricably linked with making people feel good. Such work has been labelled as emotional 
labour and distinguishes between surface acting (displaying emotion without experiencing it) 
and deep acting (involving thinking and visualising to induce the emotion in the situation).22
Briner challenges psychologists to broaden research to throw light on the complexities 
of emotions in the workplace. He notes that organisations specify the emotions they would 
like their employees to feel in the mission statements, and in more subtle ways in terms of 
the rewards and career enhancements people receive when they display appropriate emotions. 
However, he suggests that little is known about the incidence of emotion at work and the part it 
plays in work behaviours.23 The illustration shown in Table 4.4, although simplistic, plots a pos-
sible sequence of events and the effects of power of rewards and on psychological well-being.
Note also the discussion on emotional intelligence later in this chapter.
Stress at work
The significance of stress at work is discussed in Chapter 3. Personality is a contributing fac-
tor in the understanding of stress. Stress is a complex topic: it is individually defined and 
is intrinsically tied into an individual’s perceptual system. Everyone has a range of comfort 
within which they can feel steady and safe. Stress occurs when each individual feels that they 
are working outside of that comfort zone. Individuals will differ when they feel discomfort. 
The effects of stress will differ too; for some, the incidence of stress may energise and activate 
but for others it may immobilise.
Type A and Type B personalities
Two polar sets of behaviour that link with personality and health have been identified by 
medical students Friedman and Rosenman, who identified recurring patterns of personality 
in patients suffering from premature heart disease.23 Individuals with a Type A personality are 
●   Jane is asked to carry out a difficult project, usually given only to more experienced 
colleagues; she feels valued, flattered and trusted – also a little worried
●   While working hard on the project her emotions range from excitement and elation to fear 
and frustration
●   She completes the task well and feels proud and relieved
●   Jane tells her boss and shows her completed work
●   Boss gives no thanks or praise and picks out a trivial error
●   Jane then feels resentful and angry and thinks that she will never again ‘put herself out’ for 
her boss; also feels exploited
●   Thinks about looking for another job
●   Doesn’t volunteer to do additional tasks any more
●   Starts to feel sad and disappointed
●   Updates her CV and regularly starts looking at job advertisements

excessively competitive and thrive on hard work and long hours. They work under moderate 
to high levels of stress and exhibit characteristics such as: 
 ●  a high need for achievement; 
 ●  extreme competitiveness; 
 ●  impatience with obstacles to the completion of tasks; 
 ●  aggressiveness; 
 ●  a tendency to move and speak rapidly; 
 ●  an aversion to idleness; 
 ●  restlessness and urgency about time. 
 Individuals with a  Type B personality are considered to exhibit the opposite characteristics 
from Type A. They are not preoccupied with achievement, are easygoing, rarely impatient, not 
easily frustrated, enjoy leisure time, and move and speak slowly. Type B personalities may still 
have high levels of drive and ambition but are more relaxed, work at a steady pace and do not 
exhibit a sense of time urgency. 
 According to Friedman and Rosenman, Type A personalities are far more vulnerable to 
heart attacks than Type B personalities. Individuals who have a personality classifi ed as 
Type A are more likely to suff er from heart disease under severe stress than individuals with 
a Type B personality. With training, Type A personalities can change to a Type B, provided 
they are suffi  ciently aware and fi nd time to implement change strategies. 24 Research also sup-
ports the link between stress and Type A personality. 25  
 Type A people and team performance 
 Gratton  reports on what happens when Type A people, for whom time urgency is crucial, 
get to work together with less time-urgent people. Type A people are likely to pay a great 
deal of attention to the passage of time, constantly check the time remaining and see time as 
their enemy. Typically they will be very effi  cient in their use of time, and will use deadlines to 
prioritise tasks and increase their work pace. Type A people have the potential to keep things 
moving and active but can have a detrimental impact. 26 A study by  Waller et al. found that 
where teams were responsible for completing creative tasks, Type A time-urgent people tended 
to impose strict, linear schedules on members and this reduced the innovative performance of 
the team. 27 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Most type a people are content with their personality characteristics. they welcome a demanding, competitive and 
challenging work environment, and the link with stress-related illness is exaggerated. 
 To what extent would YOU dispute this contention? Are YOU a Type A or Type B personality? 
 Ability and intelligence 
 Individuals vary with regard to their mental abilities and the extent to which they apply 
them at work, and diff erent occupations require diff erent skills, competencies and abilities. 
The ‘happy’ scenario is one where a match occurs between each individual’s abilities and 
their occupation, but reality suggests that this is not always the case. The extremes include 
employees, bored rigid with a simple task, who become careless and make a succession of 
mistakes, and the employees who have been promoted beyond their capability. The result 

128
Part 2  The individual
could be stress either for the individuals unable to cope or for their colleagues picking up the 
debris left behind.
Terminology varies, but ability is defined generally as a stable characteristic of a person’s 
capacity for physical or mental performance. Intelligence is the ability to undertake construc-
tive thinking, adaption, reasoning and problem-solving.
In a similar vein to the studies of personality, different schools of thought have emerged 
with regard to the study of abilities. Similar debates to the ones that surround the study of 
personality have also swirled around the research on intelligence. Is intelligence inherited? Is it 
constant throughout life? Is it dependent upon our life’s experiences, our culture, our educa-
tion, etc.? What is the nature of intelligence? Can it be measured, and how?
The nature of intelligence
Arguments have raged within psychologists’ circles as to the nature of intelligence. Is it depend-
ent on a general overall factor that will have an overarching effect on specific activities? Or are 
specific activities independent of each other? Spearman proposed a two-factor theory of intel-
ligence and suggested that every intellectual task involves a level of mental agility – a general 
factor (g**) – plus specific abilities (s).28 This idea, developed by Vernon, resulted in a model 
that placed abilities in a hierarchy (see Figure 4.4). Abilities at the lower end of the hierarchy 
are more likely to correlate, hence if a child has a good vocabulary, the child is more likely to 
have abilities in reading and also comprehension.29
Thurstone claimed seven primary mental abilities that can be separately measured resulting 
in a profile of scores:
● spatial ability
● perceptual speed
● numerical reasoning
● verbal reasoning
● memory
● verbal fluency
● inductive reasoning.30

Chapter 4  Individual differences and diversity
129
Intelligence – one or many?
Guilford criticised theories that aimed to simplify intelligence into a small number of factors. 
He devised a model that identified 120 different abilities and suggested that intellectual ability 
requires individuals to think in one of three dimensions:
● Content – What must the individual think about (e.g. meaning of words or numbers)?
● Operation – What kind of thinking is the individual required to do (e.g. recognising items, 
solving a problem, evaluating an outcome)?
● Product – What kind of outcome or answer is required (e.g. classifying or reordering items)?31
Guilford also expressed concern about the convergent nature of tests that required a single 
solution or answer. He suggested that tests should also be looking at an individual’s ability to 
produce divergent answers.
Emotional intelligence (EI)
Developed originally by Salovey and Mayer,32 EI (or EQ, for Emotional Quotient) is generally 
attributed to Goleman who, in 1955, published his ground-breaking work. Goleman agreed 
that the classical view of intelligence was too narrow. He felt that the emotional qualities of 
individuals should be considered. These, he felt, played a vital role in the application of intel-
ligence in everyday life. He identified the key characteristics as:
abilities such as being able to motivate oneself and persist in the face of frustrations; to con-
trol impulse and delay gratification; to regulate one’s moods and keep distress from swamp-
ing the ability to think; to empathise and to hope.33
Emotional intelligence is the sum of a range of interpersonal skills that form the public persona, 
including the emotional qualities of individuals. Goleman's model outlines five main EI constructs:
● Self-awareness
● Self-regulation
● Social skill
● Empathy
● Motivation. 
Emotional competencies are not innate talents, but rather learned capabilities that must be 
worked on and can be developed to achieve outstanding performance.
EI has received considerable attention as a key aspect of managing people effectively. Gole-
man argues for a more empathetic style of management and suggests that EI predicts top 
performance and accounts for more than 85 per cent of outstanding performance in top lead-
ers.34 The Hay Group, working with Goleman, has identified eighteen specific competencies 
that make up the four components of EI and has produced an inventory designed to measure 
emotional competence (see Figure 4.5). The Emotional Competence Inventory defines EI as 
‘The capacity for recognising our own feelings and those of others, for motivating ourselves 
and for managing emotions within ourselves and with others.’35
Significance of emotional intelligence
Research from the Chartered Management Institute identifies EI as one of the key skills man-
agers and leaders will need in the coming decade.36 According to Landale, it should really be 
no surprise to find EQ so much in demand.
After all, we work in structures which are much flatter than ever. We have to be much faster 
on our feet with both colleagues and clients and, whatever the team structure, there is 
increasing proximity for us to build the relationships we need – fast. In this context EQ is the 
glue that holds people and teams together.37

130
Part 2  The individual
Venus makes the point that success in the boardroom is not just down to sound business sense 
and technical competence; interpersonal relationships also play a key role. The set of compe-
tencies known as EI are often overlooked in terms of professional success.38
Developing EI
Landale refers to the importance of empathy in EI, which involves how a person self-manages 
and addresses how to engage with the emotions of others, and suggests a six-step process for 
developing EI:
	1.	 Know what you feel.
	2.	 Know why you feel it.
	3.	 Acknowledge the emotion and know how to manage it.
	4.	 Know how to motivate yourself and make yourself feel better.
	5.	 Recognise the emotions of other people and develop empathy.
	6.	 Express your feelings appropriately and manage relationships.
There seems little doubt that managers and leaders who have trained up in EQ have far 
more initiative in dealing with organizational life than those who don’t. Stress will always 
exist at work, but EQ gives people the tools and ways of thinking to manage it to their 
advantage.39
According to Dann, becoming highly self-aware allows an individual to recognise inner and 
outer conflict and develop more proactive self-management. Developing greater social aware-
ness allows the fostering of productive relations and a greater degree of engagement between 
employees and management. A manager with a high EQ benefits both the organisation and 
the individual.40
However, Alexander reports on research concerning the negative uses and dark side of EI, 
and questions what happens when people start using it to manipulate others in order to fur-
ther their own careers. Those on the dark side of EI will scrutinise the emotions of others but 
are adept at controlling their own emotional displays. For example, bosses with negative EI 
in mind may focus on employees’ emotions for cynical purposes. Employees looking to profit 
by dark EI may constantly scrutinise a superior’s emotions for ways to enhance how they are 
estimated by attuning to the superior’s state of mind.41

 Attitudes 
 Another factor that infl uences and distinguishes individual behaviour is a person’s attitudes. 
So what are  attitudes and how can they be distinguished from beliefs and values? Attitudes 
can be defi ned as providing a state of ‘readiness’ or tendency to respond in a particular way. 42 
 Beliefs are concerned with what is known about the world; they centre on what ‘is’, on reality 
as it is understood.  Values are concerned with what ‘should’ be and what is desirable. 
 There are no limits to the attitudes people hold. Attitudes are learned throughout life and 
are embodied within our socialisation process. Some attitudes (such as religious beliefs) may be 
central to us – a core construct – and may be highly resistant to any change, whereas other, more 
peripheral attitudes may change with new information or personal experiences. Specifi c events, 
particularly traumatic ones such as redundancy, may have a dramatic eff ect on our attitudes. 
 Gross suggests that ‘to convert a belief into an attitude, a “value” ingredient is needed 
which, by defi nition, is to do with an individual’s sense of what is desirable, good, valua-
ble, worthwhile and so on’. Gross has suggested that whereas ‘adults may have thousands of 
beliefs, they may have only hundreds of attitudes and a few dozen values’. 43  Hofstede defi nes 
values as a ‘broad tendency to prefer certain states of aff airs over others’. 44 
 The functions of attitudes 
 Katz has suggested that attitudes and motives are interlinked and, depending on an individu-
al’s motives, attitudes can serve four main functions: 
 ●  Knowledge – One of the major functions is to provide a basis for the interpretation and 
classifi cation of new information. Attitudes provide a knowledge base and a framework 
within which new information can be placed. 
 ●  Expressive – Attitudes become a means of expression. They enable individuals to indicate 
to others the values that they hold and thus to express their self-concept and adopt or inter-
nalise the values of a group. 
 ●  Instrumental – Held attitudes maximise rewards and minimise sanctions. Hence, attitudes 
towards other people (or objects) might be held because of past positive (or negative) expe-
riences. Behaviour or knowledge that has resulted in the satisfaction of needs is thus more 
likely to result in a favourable attitude. 
 ●  Ego-defensive – Attitudes may be held in order to protect the ego from an undesirable truth 
or reality. 45 
 Employee attitude surveys 
 Attitude surveys or questionnaires are used by many organisations as a way of attempting to 
gauge the climate of the organisation and monitor views of members of staff . The Chartered 
Management Institute defi nes an employee attitude survey as: 
   A planned procedure which enables managers to explore employees’ opinions both on par-
ticular issues, and on the organisation itself, so as to be able to take account of them in the 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 It is evident that emotional intelligence (eI) is the single most important predictor of the capacity for effective work 
performance and professional success. organisations should concentrate their efforts on identifying and developing 
eI for all managers.

planning process, or make changes that will be beneficial to both the organisation and indi-
viduals who work within it.
Surveys can be used to monitor employees’ views or gauge effects of a new policy, and provide 
effective communications or a sounding board. It is crucial that people understand reasons 
for the survey, the benefits it may have and are assured there are no ‘hidden agendas’. Surveys 
require significant time and resources to administer and evaluate. The frequency should be no 
more than every eighteen months, and it is important to communicate results of the survey 
and plans of action to both senior managers and all employees.46 The usual method of meas-
urement is by adopting a five-point ‘Likert scale’ that reflects the comparative strength of the 
attitude.47 See the example in Table 4.5.
Theories on attitude change stress the importance of balance and consistency in our psy-
che. Heider, for example, suggests that not only would we find it uncomfortable to hold two 
conflicting attitudes, but to do so would motivate us to change one of the attitudes in order to 
reach a balanced state.48

 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 changing the behaviour of people is comparatively easy but changes to underlying personality or attitudes are far 
more difficult. a change in behaviour does not necessarily mean a change in a person’s personality or attitudes. 
 Do YOU believe we should simply concentrate on how to change behaviour and ignore the study of personality and 
attitudes? 
 Cognitive dissonance is the term given by  Festinger to the discomfort felt when we act in a 
way that is inconsistent with our true beliefs. When there is inconsistency between our behav-
iour and a consciously held attitude, we experience a feeling of dissonance and we are moti-
vated to reduce its impact. 49 
 Testing and assessment 
 Much has been written about the value of selection tests and questionnaires and how they 
are subject to constant debate with regard to the validity of these measures – that is, do they 
actually measure what they claim to measure? It should be noted that the word ‘test’ is often 
taken to refer to measures of intelligence, achievement and developed abilities, and aptitude 
for particular tasks. Measures of interests, social attitudes, emotional stability or traits of per-
sonality are usually referred to as questionnaires or profi les, or similar. Answers are regarded 
as common or uncommon, typical or untypical, rather than right or wrong, good or bad. 
 The word ‘test’ is therefore usually avoided in such measures, as, for example, the Cat-
tell 16PF Questionnaire. Also, the terms ‘personality tests’ and ‘psychometric tests’ are often 
used interchangeably. Strictly, however, personality tests measure only enduring characteristics 
of an individual, whereas a psychometric test measures a broader range of all psychological 
characteristics. Most people will have taken a  psychometric test  of one kind or another by the 
time they are an adult in employment. Tests may be administered at school or college, or as 
part of the selection assessment process at work. The use of tests is widespread and growing. 
They are perceived to be useful as an objective discriminating tool, but they are not without 
controversies and sensitivities. 
 For a test to be considered as a psychological instrument it must be  objective, standardised, 
reliable, valid and  discriminating (but not discriminatory). The selection and choice of the test 
should be based on a number of other key features such as its acceptability, practicality, time, 
costs, and perceived and actual added value. 
 Use and limitations of tests 
 All tests have limitations. Tests can sample behaviour only at one particular moment in time. 
The information they provide is dependent upon good testing practice and will only add evi-
dence to the decision-making process. Tests will not provide the answer. Some individuals are 
very nervous and may not perform at their best, and indeed some may feel indignant that they 
are obliged to take a test at all. Great skill is required, therefore, in the administering of tests 
or questionnaires and in the interpretation of results. A suitable physical environment is also 
important. The possible reaction of candidates must be considered. Some might fi nd any form 
of ‘test’ something of an ordeal or regard it as an unpleasantness. A major concern with the 
majority of tests is the doubts about validity and lack of statistically proven reliability. 
 Goss suggests that the use of personality assessments not only is an infringement of the indi-
vidual’s privacy, but also leads to unfortunate organisational consequences, with ‘cloning’ as 
an outcome. Such techniques can be perceived as a form of social engineering and an insidious 

134
part 2 the IndIvIdual
form of organisational control. 50 Aware of these problems, the British Psychological Society has 
produced guidelines and codes of practice for users of psychometric tests. Furthermore, evi-
dence is emerging to show that where personality questionnaires have been specifi cally designed 
and related to work characteristics, prediction and validity scores are much higher. 51  
 Reasons for using psychological tests may be summarised as follows. Tests should be seen as 
an additional source of information only, but administered properly they can: 
 ●  make more systematic and precise decisions about people; 
 ●  predict future performance and reduce uncertainty; 
 ●  provide more accurate descriptions of people and their behaviour. 
 However, it must be remembered that: 
 ●  tests may be expensive and time consuming; 
 ●  without proper professional practice, they can be misused and results abused; 
 ●  they may be seen as an intrusion; 
 ●  they may be regarded as inappropriate; 
 ●  practice may have an eff ect on test results. 
 A major consideration in the controversy about the use of psychometric tests is how to avoid 
any cultural bias. There are still widespread doubts and criticisms about the use and value of 
personality tests, and continuing debate about their value in predicting performance at work. 
Even when psychometric tests  are used, they should not be used in isolation but applied in 
appropriate circumstances as part of a comprehensive selection process or assessment centre. 
It is also important to ensure adequate feedback to candidates in the process. 
 As  Yeung  points out, although there are good personality tests available, personality testing is 
a completely unregulated market that does not require a licence or any qualifi cations. There is no 
legislation to protect people from unscrupulous untrained consultants selling in-house personal-
ity tests. The best tests indicate results at one point in time that are found to predict performance 
at a later date. Without predictive validity, a personality test is essentially worthless. 52  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 despite continuing popularity, so-called personality tests have limited value in predicting suitability for a job or likely 
work performance. not only are they a waste of time, but too often tests are used to avoid personal responsibility for 
judgements and decision-making. 
 What is YOUR considered opinion? What is YOUR own experience of taking a personality test? 
 Diversity in the workplace 
 An integral and essential feature of individual diff erences is diversity. We have seen from the 
discussion above that people are not homogeneous.  Diversity focuses on the multiplicity of 
diff erences among people – on the variety of people as heterogeneous groupings. Individual 
diff erences are the basis of diversity. 
 Individual diff erences and diversity have long been recognised as important for eff ective 
team performance, but in recent years greater attention has been given to the management of 
diversity. Reasons for this include: 
 ●  changing social attitudes; 
 ●  more global environment and increasing internationalisation; 
 ●  infl uence of the European Commission; 

Chapter 4  Individual differences and diversity
135
● Equality Act 2010 and equal employment opportunities legislation;
● government action to increase female representation at senior levels;
● demographic changes in the workforce;
● wider customer base;
● shortage of higher-level skills;
● programmes of affirmative action, inclusion and positive discrimination;
● increasing number of women, older and part-time workers in the workforce.
However, valuing differences is easier said than done. It means relating and working with peo-
ple who hold different perspectives and views, bringing different qualities to the workplace, 
having different aspirations and different customs and traditions. Differences are challenging; 
they question people’s views, perceptions and attitudes, and require individuals to see things 
from a different frame of reference.
Diversity is relevant to anything that may affect workplace relationships and achievements. 
The Chartered Management Institute provides the following description of diversity:
The concept of diversity encompasses any sort of difference between individuals. These could 
be differences in ethnic origin, age, disability, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, fam-
ily status, religion, education, social class, and even personality or attitudes. The management 
of diversity involves developing and implementing inclusive strategies through which a net-
work of varied individuals are integrated into a dynamic workforce.53
From equal opportunities to managing diversity
Equal opportunities relates to legislation intended to outlaw discrimination. The government 
is committed to protect individuals at work against discrimination. Encouraging a diverse 
workforce is high on the government’s agenda and the reluctant employer is having its hand 
forced by statutory obligations. Although diversity in the workplace relates to treating every-
one equally, it complements and further develops initiatives on equal opportunities. Future 
demographic patterns present new challenges for managers.
Diversity management goes beyond what is required by legislation designed to promote 
equal opportunities and prevent discrimination. It comprises an approach which recognises 
and values differences and aims to make positive use of the unique talents and perspectives 
within the workforce. The focus is on individuals rather than minority groups.54
Employers Network for Equality and Inclusion
Employers Network for Equality and Inclusion (enei) is the UK’s leading employer network, 
covering all aspects of equality and inclusion in the workplace. Enei works with business 
members and their leaders, covering all aspects of equality and inclusion in the workplace in 
order to make change happen. Strategic themes are pan-diversity and include:
● unconscious bias – its impact on attitudes, behaviours and decision-making;
● inclusive leadership – creating inclusive cultures through behaviour change;
● agile working – changing the way people work and improve organisational effectiveness;
● workforce representation – driving competitive advantage by attracting and retaining 
diverse talent;
● access to opportunities – promoting social mobility and opening up work opportunities;
● managing diversity and inclusion in a global marketplace – maximising business perfor-
mance through the development of talented people working across cultural and geographi-
cal boundaries.
Enei recognises that equality and inclusion issues often cut across the ‘protected characteris-
tics’ defined under the Equality Act 2010 and help employers think about equality and inclu-
sion in a broader sense.55

 Business case for diversity 
 As businesses become increasingly global it is even more important for managers to have a 
sound understanding of diverse countries and workforces. According to ACAS, the business 
case for diversity – that a more diverse employee base will attract a more diverse customer base 
and increase sales, improve performance, etc. – is a well-argued one. 56 
 A joint report from the CBI and TUC, supported by the Equality and Human Rights Com-
mission, suggests that promoting diversity in the workplace and employing people solely on 
the basis of their ability can bring many real business benefi ts. These include: 
 ●  increasing employee satisfaction, which helps attract new staff  and retain those already 
there, reduces recruitment costs and can increase productivity; 
 ●  understanding better how the company’s diverse customers think and what drives their 
spending habits, or how companies access markets they have not previously been able to tap 
into so eff ectively; 
 ●  fi nding enough workers to fi ll skills gaps in areas with tight labour markets, where there are 
not enough ‘obvious candidates’ for the vacancies companies have. 
 The report also makes clear that diversity can be improved through positive action – such as encour-
aging applications from types of people who have not in the past applied for jobs, additional train-
ing, providing support networks or adapting work practices – but not positive discrimination. 57  
 Diversity and management recruitment 
 The Institute for Employment Studies, in conjunction with the Chartered Management Insti-
tute, emphasises the importance of diversity as a strategic priority for retaining and developing 
key people in an organisation. They draw attention to the diff erent career ambitions of manag-
ers from under-represented groups and state that, if organisations want management talent at 
the top, recruitment approaches must recognise that managers from diff erent ethnic groups are 
attracted by diff erent benefi ts. For example, compared with other ethnic groups, black manag-
ers were more likely to cite good progression opportunities; Asian managers more likely to cite 
working for a good employer; managers from mixed backgrounds to cite challenging work; 
white managers and black managers more likely to mention better work/life balance. 58  
 Diversity and social class 
 Although many fi rms pat themselves on the back for their diversity policies,  Reeves suggests 
that, in fact, social mobility in the UK is in steady decline and class inequality is not dead. If 
businesses continue to run a ‘people like us’ strategy when it comes to talent, they risk blunt-
ing their own competitive edge. 
 To be blunt: it is perfectly possible to look ‘diverse’ by hiring and promoting, in suﬃ  cient num-
bers, posh women, posh ethnic minorities and posh gay men and lesbians. All of which is bet-
ter, for sure, than a monopoly of posh straight white men. But the standard diversity agenda 
misses the more subtle inequalities of class. 59  
 A summary of equality at work is set out in the concept map in  Figure  4.6 . 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 despite all the rhetoric and claimed advantages of diversity, it is still more about the benefits to business rather than 
moral or social concerns. In reality, it is little more than another form of political correctness and viewed with scepti-
cism by many members of the workforce. 
 How would YOU respond to such a claim? What is YOUR experience?

 Diversity management and training 
 More than ever, eff ective organisational performance demands an understanding of, and 
response to, diversity. This necessitates a work climate that respects individual diff erences and 
treats all members of staff  with dignity and mutual respect. Diversity training will not be eff ec-
tive unless there is active support from the top and it is recognised as a company-wide initia-
tive and part of the core value of the organisation. 
 Organisations need to manage diversity in a manner that benefi ts the well-being of all 
members of staff . Training should involve: 
 ●  increasing the awareness and value of diversity; 
 ●  education in understanding the culture and values of members of a diverse workforce; 
 ●  the ability to communicate eff ectively with all members of staff  – and also customers and 
suppliers; 
 ●  developing the skills of eff ective diversity management; 
 ●  addressing biases, prejudices and stereotypes. 
 Business in the Community (BITC) is one of the agencies that help businesses to embrace a 
culture of inclusiveness by promoting equality of opportunity for all staff , irrespective of gen-
der, race, age, disability, sexual orientation and faith. 
 We know that creating diverse and inclusive workplaces is a business imperative, not a nice 
thing to do. Organisations benefi t when they create workplaces which tap into a diverse 
range of skills and talents . . . We also campaign on the issues which will make the most 
benefi cial diff erence to individuals, society and our economy. 60 
 
 Management and organisational behaviour in action case study 
 Lloyds Banking Group Diversity Programme 
 at lloyds Banking Group, diversity and inclusion is central to our business success. our 25 million customers are 
very diverse and if we are to be successful, we need to ensure that we understand and can meet their diverse needs. 
refl ecting the diversity of the uK population in our own workforce helps us to achieve that goal. We are therefore 
creating an environment where everyone can provide excellent service to our customers and develop their indi-
vidual careers, whatever their background. our commitment starts at the top of the organisation, with our Group 
executive sponsoring our diversity programme by taking the lead on initiatives that improve both the quality of our 
customer service and the working environment for our colleagues. through a range of initiatives and strategies, we 
work hard to ensure lloyds Banking Group is inclusive for everyone. 
 We participate in benchmarking exercises run by national campaigns covering the main diversity strands. these 
benchmarks independently assess performance, track progress over time and compare performance against other 
organisations. this kind of external evaluation is extremely important to us and helps lloyds Banking Group to main-
tain momentum and continue to strive to retain its leading edge status. 
 our policies, programmes and practices are recognised as amongst the best, and the strategy is underpinned by 
focus on these key actions: 
 1.   Diversity metrics –  all aspects of the workforce are monitored, analysed and reported on by diversity demo-
graphic. progress is measured half yearly and the diversity interventions in place are measured for eff ectiveness 
using key performance indicators. 
 2.  Colleague research –  extensive quantitative and qualitative research is carried out with colleagues to ensure 
that strategies in place address their specifi c needs. In addition, ongoing consultation with employees provides 
feedback on how well the strategy is working. 
 3.  training and development –  our focus is on developing talent and ensuring that all colleagues can progress 
their careers regardless of gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or age. personal 

CHAPTER 4 INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND DIVERSITY
139
development workshops for speciﬁ c groups are also available, which inspire and motivate attendees to take con-
trol of their personal and career aspirations/development. 
 4.  Top level commitment –  as well as agreeing and committing to the delivery of the diversity programme, our 
Group Executive Committee and Board monitor progress. In addition, our Group Executives act as sponsors for 
the organisation’s disability, ethnicity, gender, agility and sexual orientation programmes. The power of such top 
level commitment and the success that can be seen from it is evidenced by us recently receiving the highest score 
ever awarded to an organisation by the Business Disability Forum. A major contribution to such an accolade is 
the success of our Workplace Adjustment Programme. This leading edge initiative includes: 
 ●   End-to-end case management with external suppliers who are experts in this ﬁ eld. 
 ●   30 day Service Level Agreement from initiation of request to completion of adjustments. 
 ●   Central funding of all physical adjustments (IT equipment, software, furniture). 
 ●   Speciﬁ c guidance on non-physical adjustments (e.g. changes to working patterns, targets, rest breaks). 
 ●   Training and coaching for both colleagues and their line managers around any assistive technology with which 
they have been provided. 
 In addition, Lloyds Banking Group deliver personal and career development programmes for staff with impairments 
or long-term health conditions. These programmes have been specifically tailored to meet the needs of those who 
live and work with a disability or impairment. Through detailed research, we found that standard training methods 
on assertiveness, influencing skills, personal empowerment and career development weren’t as effective for col-
leagues with impairments. In addition, our research with disabled staff demonstrated that having access to positive 
action training had a huge impact on their engagement within the organisation.

 Tasks 
  1.  Discuss how you believe reﬂ ecting on workforce diversity can help an organisation achieve its business success. 
  2.  Give your views on the four key actions that underpin Lloyds Banking Group’s diversity programme strategy. 
  3.  To what extent do you think there is a high top level of commitment to the disability programme in your  university 
or organisation? 
 The eﬀ ective management of diversity will also entail a review of organisational processes 
and the execution of work. For example, not everyone: 
 ●  shares the same work ethic or seeks the same goals and objectives; 
 ●  responds in the same way to working in a bureaucratic structure; 
 ●  works better in a self-managed group or with a more participative style of management; 
 ●  will ﬁ t the same psychometric proﬁ le; 
 ●  is motivated in the same way; or 
 ●  reacts the same way to diﬀ erent forms of control. 
 Diversity management requires time and eﬀ ort and may well have a high ﬁ nancial cost. There 
is a general feeling that badly managed initiatives do more harm than good. Managing diver-
sity requires a company-wide philosophy and commitment, a change to organisational culture 
and supportive systems of management and training. 
 The Oﬃ  ce for National Statistics (ONS) is committed to being an equal opportunities employer and to achieving 
equality of opportunity for all employees. ONS values and welcomes diversity and all employees are entitled to work 
in an environment free from discrimination and harassment. 
 ONS – equality and diversity policy 
➔

140
Part 2  The individual
Our equality and diversity policy aims to ensure that existing employees and applicants for jobs are treated fairly 
and within the law. No ONS employees or applicants for jobs in ONS should receive less favourable treatment on 
unjustifiable grounds because of their: sex, marital or civil partnership status, age, race, disability, responsibility for 
dependants, religion or belief (actual or perceived), sexual orientation (actual or perceived), transgender status, preg-
nancy, political beliefs, trade union activities, working patterns or contract status.
ONS supports a range of flexible working patterns to enable employees to balance home and work responsibili-
ties and treats people fairly, irrespective of their working arrangements.
Key points of Equality and Diversity work at ONS:
● The Director General of ONS chairs the Equality and Diversity Steering Groups, which set the strategic direction 
for all equality work, scrutinising, monitoring and staff survey data;
● ONS has diversity champions to cover each of its sites, alongside a senior sponsor for each of its 15 diversity net-
work groups;
● ONS exceeds its statutory equality duties as a public authority and is committed to achieving best practice in 
promoting equality and eliminating discrimination and harassment. To aid this, ONS participated in a number of 
equality benchmarking exercises and recently became the first organisation to receive the ‘Gold Standard’ in the 
Business Disability Forum’s Disability Standard.
Promoting equality is core to the expectations ONS staff should have of ONS as an employer, and in the expectations 
ONS has of its workforce; all staff are required to have an objective that covers equality and diversity, which forms 
part of the annual performance review.
ONS has a detailed Equality and Diversity Strategy (2012–2016) and four detailed action plans for 2014–2015, 
which cover:
● Representation of women at senior levels
● Disability Action Plan
● Part-time working Action Plan
● Ethnicity Action Plan.

Diversity and stereotyping
Diversity also challenges many traditional stereotypes (discussed in Chapter 6). Stereotyping 
infers that people within a particular perceived category are assumed to share the same traits 
or characteristics. Stereotypes are a means of making simplified judgements of other people 
instead of coping with a range of individual stimuli. Stereotyping attributes to all individu-
als the characteristics or tendencies of the categorisation as a whole. An important feature 
of managing diversity is an awareness of, and training in, overcoming inaccurate stereotyped 
perceptions and attributions. A greater understanding of cultural differences in non-verbal 
communications and body language will help improve interpersonal relationships.
There have been instances in my life, both at home and at work, when people have felt I’m a lit-
tle crazy because I am pushy, outspoken, energetic, competitive, enthusiastic, driven and strong. 
Crazy, because that’s not what’s expected of an Asian woman. Crazy, because it’s not what the 
majority of people are like. And crazy, because they think they know me better than I know myself.

Gender diversity
One of the most significant and important aspects of managing diversity is that of gender 
equality, and the participation of men and women in the workforce.63 One of our initial per-
ceptions and classifications of another individual is usually the identification of their gender. 
How does this perception affect our behaviour?

Chapter 4  Individual differences and diversity
141
● What difference does it make if our work group is predominantly male or female?
● Do women and men have different experiences at work?
● If organisations are rational and neutral institutions – why should gender make a difference?
● Does it matter that many classic theories have been based on research carried out on men, 
by male researchers?
● What has been the influence of diversity policies on work behaviour and on the position of 
women in organisations?
Since 2011, when Lord Davies set a target of achieving 25 per cent women directors for FTSE 
companies, to now, in 2015, there have been continual media reports on the number of women 
in senior positions in business. However, as Bernadette Barber, for example, points out: ‘we have 
come a long way in the past hundred years but achieving true diversity at all levels of working life is 
not an easy nut to crack’.64 However, Laura Spira and Helen Pitcher maintain that it is unfortunate 
that diversity has become synonymous with gender in media discussions. They raise the debat-
able issue of voluntary or mandatory quotas. Material diversity in the boardroom is not always 
synonymous with a well-performing board. Although there is some argument to correlate gender 
diversity with effective performance, this should not ignore other bases for argument.65
Managing an ageing workforce
The focus on diversity has drawn attention to managing the generation gap and the increas-
ing numbers of older people in the workforce. The EU refers to the ageing population, to the 
future shrinking of the working-age population and to the whole world ageing fast. Working 
longer is not enough. We need to empower older people to participate and contribute to their 
communities so that they can remain autonomous as long as possible. This requires a more 
age-friendly and inclusive society.66
Now that the UK default retirement age of 65 has been removed there will be an increasing 
challenge to manage an intergenerational workforce. Barnes suggests that, at worst, young 
workers can see their older colleagues as dinosaurs, set in their ways and blocking creativity, 
as well as their own path to promotion. Older workers, too, can feel threatened by the energy 
and technological ease of their younger colleagues or impatient with their brashness and lack 
of experience. Managers need to recognise and harness differences in skills, motivations and 
work routines to deliver high-quality output and mutual learning.67
According to a report by the CMI and CIPD, there is plenty of encouraging news about 
managers’ attitudes to the ageing workforce and older workers are seen as valuable employees 
who bring vital skills, knowledge and experience to their jobs. However, organisations still 
need to work hard with their policies of recruitment, retention and development to prepare for 
the impact of demographic change.68
Earlier (see Chapter 3), attention was drawn to three different generations and age groups 
in the workplace. As people live and work longer there will be a wider spread of age groups in 
the workforce. Wilton, for example, suggests a fourth generation, that of ‘Homelanders’ born 
after 9/11 changed the world.
That the late Boomers and early Gen X aren’t going to be quick to jack it in and buy a boat 
has key implications for retirement, pensions and health policies. And maybe that’s no bad 
thing. Sometimes amid more high-profile efforts to increase gender and racial diversity in the 
workplaces, older groups are forgotten.69
Criticisms and limitations
Despite potential benefits from diversity, there are a number of criticisms and perceived limi-
tations. While acknowledging that the positive management of diversity aims to promote 
an inclusive culture in which individuals are valued and respected, the CMI points out that 

142
part 2 the IndIvIdual
diversity management should not be mistaken for equal opportunities or be merely a question 
of legal compliance. Managers should avoid handling diversity issues insensitively, invading 
employees’ privacy, failing to consult and gain commitment throughout the organisation or 
falling into an ‘us’ and ‘them’ mentality. 70 
 Individuality and groups 
 Social interaction is a natural feature of human behaviour, and group working is a major 
feature of organisational life. Strong and cohesive groups can have benefi cial eff ects for the 
organisation but there are potential disadvantages. There is arguably a potential confl ict with 
workforce diversity because of the need to consider staff  both as individuals and as members of 
a group. The greater the compatibility of its members and the more homogeneous the group, 
the greater the danger of the group developing its own sub-culture. Members may display a 
critical attitude towards people outside the group or members of other groups. Encouraging 
individuality and at the same time expecting group co-operation and teamwork are potential 
triggers for tension.  Group cohesiveness is discussed in  Chapter  8  . 
 Diversity can also be threatened by power relationships. The concept of social exchange 
theory ( discussed in  Chapter  1 ) suggests that social exchanges are infl uenced by a complex 
web of power relationships and, as a result, are not always equal but have an uneven balance 
of outcomes. Those individuals at the lower end of power relationships, perhaps for example 
part-time or casual workers or ethnic minorities, may arguably be disadvantaged. 
 Concern for moral and social issues 
 A major concern with the increasing attention to diversity is that too much attention is given 
to the advantages for business rather than to broader moral or social issues and the ethical 
arguments for equality of treatment. 
 In arguing the case for combining heterogeneity and homogeneity,  Nordström and Ridder-
stråle suggest that although quite often people talk favourably about diversity since it suppos-
edly promotes a better atmosphere and equality, the typical manager is persuaded to change 
the mix of people at the company for economic reasons: ‘The competitive reality is that organ-
isations that are bogged down in issues of race, gender, age, sexual preferences, look and so 
on, will slip deeper down in the mire.’ 71  Kirton and Greene believe that the ‘business case’ 
should be broadened to include wider issues of social justice and social responsibility. 72 
 According to  Lucas, one of the key messages the experts want to get across is that paying 
attention to diversity is not just a moral obligation, it is a business imperative.  
 Workers in organisations where diversity is valued generally feel more engaged with their 
employer and are more likely to stay on board. The organisation will build a reputation as an 
‘enlightened’ employer, and will be able to attract the best people at a time when talent is at 
a premium. The business can also draw on the expertise of its diverse workforce to create new 
and improved products and services which will help them get ahead in competitive, global 
markets. 73 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Whatever the skills, experience or qualifications of an individual, personality is arguably the most important cri-
terion for employability, subsequent relationships with other people at work, personal development and career 
progression.

at work? 

CHAPTER 4 INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND DIVERSITY
143
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  The individual is a central feature of organisational behaviour. Managers need to be competent 
at selecting and developing individuals of value to the organisation. 
  2   Individual diﬀ erences can be the potential source of problems and conﬂ ict, and managing 
interpersonal relationships is riddled with complexity and contradictions. 
  3  A signiﬁ cant diﬀ erence among individuals is in terms of their personality – those stable charac-
teristics that explain why a person behaves in a particular way. 
  4  Discussion of personality concerns uniqueness and similarities. Studies on personality can be 
divided into two main approaches, nomothetic and idiographic. 
  5   People vary in their abilities and intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EI) focuses on the range 
of the individual’s interpersonal skills and emotional qualities. 
  6  Attitudes provide a state of readiness or tendency to respond in a particular way. Assessment of 
attitudes is vital in selecting potential employees and managers. 
  7  Psychometric tests and personality questionnaires may help to identify individual characteris-
tics but are subject to doubts and criticisms about their predictive value. 
  8  Diversity focuses on the multiplicity of individual diﬀ erences among people. Valuing diﬀ er-
ences is not easy and demands the eﬀ ective management of diversity. 
  9   An increasing number of organisations appear to recognise the business case for diversity but 
there are potential criticisms, including concern for moral and social issues. 
  10  Eﬀ ective organisational performance demands an understanding of, and a response to, a work 
climate that respects and values individual diﬀ erences and diversity. 
  1  Explain fully what you see as the main issues and diﬃ  culties relating to the eﬀ ective management of individuals 
at work. 
  2  How would you explain the big ﬁ ve model of personality traits? What value for the practical manager do you 
place on this model? 
  3  To what extent do you believe you can relate an individual’s personality type to career choice and successful 
work performance? 
  4  Explain your understanding of emotional intelligence and discuss critically its signiﬁ cance and applications for 
work organisations. 
  5  Why are attitudes diﬃ  cult to measure and change? Explain your understanding of cognitive dissonance. 
  6  Relating to your own experience where possible, discuss critically both the potential beneﬁ ts and limitations of 
psychometric testing. 
  7  What questions would you ask to provide an assessment of the individual characteristics of one person from 
your work or study group? How accurate do you feel your assessment is likely to be?

 Personal skills and employability exercise 
 B&Q is the largest chain of DIY (do-it-yourself) stores 
in the UK, selling materials and equipment for the 
home improvement and domestic gardening market. 
The founders, Richard Block and David Quayle, opened 
their ﬁ rst store in Southampton in 1969, and after nearly 
twenty years of growth the company was acquired by 
FW Woolworth and is presently part of the Kingﬁ sher 
Group. Kingﬁ sher also owns the Brico Depot, Screwﬁ x 
and Castorama DIY stores and has a 50 per cent stake in 
the Koçtaş Group in Turkey, giving it a major presence in 
Europe and Asia. The majority of B&Q stores are in the UK 
and Ireland and the headquarters remain in Hampshire. 
 The business has always sourced some of its prod-
ucts  from Chinese manufacturers and so had strong 
links in the Far East from the outset. These links helped 
the company to expand its sales business into the Far 
East and, in 1996, it opened a store in Taiwan. In 1999 
it moved into mainland China and is now well estab-
lished in the Chinese market with thirty-nine stores, 
including the world’s largest, B&Q Beijing, which also 
sells furniture and furnishing materials. The nature of 
the Chinese property market has also made it viable for 
the company to oﬀ er a ﬁ tting and decorating service for 
customers moving into newly built apartments (called

‘Do-it-for-Me’), thereby expanding its business opportu-
nities through a strategy of vertical integration.
In 2014 it operated 360 stores across the UK and 
Ireland, although that was set to reduce to 300 during 
2015–16 as part of Kingfisher’s plan to rationalise its 
overall business structure.74 Despite being significantly 
affected by the drop in the housing market during 2007–
9, B&Q continued to perform strongly, and in Decem-
ber 2014 its ‘Sharesave’ employee ownership scheme 
announced £3.3 million growth, giving employee inves-
tors an average dividend of £1573.75
B&Q and the ‘demographic time bomb’
As is noted towards the end of this chapter, the UK 
population is ageing, and the impact of this so-called 
‘demographic time bomb’ began to generate particular 
concerns during the late 1980s. Some businesses, like 
B&Q, took a critical look at their current employment 
practices as a result of predicted shortages in certain 
parts of the labour market, and the consequent fear of 
intensified competition between employers for younger 
workers. This was particularly important for a growing 
company like B&Q, which might find its expansion plans 
would be seriously harmed by labour shortages. In 
1989, therefore, B&Q management reviewed the work-
force, and noted that not only did it have a predomi-
nantly young age profile (the majority of staff were aged 
16–26), but also staff turnover costs were particularly 
high in the 18–20-year-old category. They also noted 
positive customer feedback about their older staff, who 
appeared to deliver better customer service, partly 
because of their own knowledge of DIY.
The company management decided to tackle the 
problem by challenging widely held views about the dis-
advantages and problems of employing older workers. 
Initially, the B&Q board expressed some concerns about 
the proposal to target older people in the labour mar-
ket and was naturally cautious about unproven claims of 
their effectiveness.
In 1990 it seemed to make good common sense to 
employ older people but a number of stereotypes and 
issues were raised. Answers were needed to explode 
these myths.76
The concerns and myths about older workers reflected 
findings in other studies on the subject, such as that 
reported in 1993 to the Institute of Personnel Manage-
ment (now the CIPD).77 These included both positive and 
negative features; for instance, older workers were seen 
as more reliable, loyal, conscientious and hard working 
than younger ones; at the same time they were viewed 
as less adaptable, especially to new technology, as well as 
being less able and less motivated to learn or be trained. 
Other studies have shown that stereotypical views about 
older workers tend to cluster under general headings of 
poor performance (including those related to assump-
tions about age-related physical impairment), absentee-
ism and turnover.78 There were also concerns about the 
relationship between younger and older workers, and 
particularly those between young managers and older 
staff members.
B&Q managers decided that it would be important 
to collect some hard evidence if they were to gain the 
backing of the business owners. In 1990 B&Q opened 
a new store in Macclesfield, staffed wholly by workers 
over 50. The experiment was monitored by a research 
team from Warwick University, who carried out a 
study to benchmark the Macclesfield store’s perfor-
mance against a selection of four similar stores during 
its first year of operation. The results were significant: 
the Warwick team reported that the Macclesfield store 
had higher profits, substantially reduced staff turnover, 
over a third less absenteeism and almost two-thirds 
less ‘shrinkage’ (loss to stock as the result of damage or 
pilfering by staff and customers).79 Many of the board’s 
concerns had clearly been put to rest; the business case 
for diversifying the workforce had been supported by 
the evidence. B&Q therefore began to adopt a positive 
approach towards the recruitment and employment 
of an age-diverse workforce. This was more than ten 
years before age discrimination legislation came into

operation in the UK, and fifteen years before the scrap-
ping of the mandatory retirement age. Further research 
in 1995 confirmed the initial results, leading the com-
pany to reaffirm its initial commitment to increasing the 
age diversity of its workforce. There were clear indica-
tions that the policy is about good business in all senses 
of the words. In 2000 the company became one of the 
founding members of the Employers Forum on Age 
(EFA),80 an independent group of over 200 UK employ-
ers that sets out to campaign for and support the cause 
of employing an age-diverse workforce, and now part 
of the Employers Network for Equality and Inclusion.81
Diversity at B&Q: the growing agenda
Having been successful with its approach to employing 
the over 50s (25 per cent of its workforce is now over 50), 
B&Q also recognises the value of a broader approach 
to diversity. The company website includes statements 
about its current approach to ethics and respect for the 
diversity of people.
The commitment of the Group's employees is vital 
to ensure that high standards of customer care and 
service are maintained throughout the business. The 
Group is fully committed to treating its employees and 
customers with dignity and respect, and to valuing 
diversity. It is Group policy to:
● ensure there is no discrimination in employment on 
the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, marital 
status, sexual orientation or religious belief;
● implement measures in stores to ensure a level of 
customer service for disabled people equivalent to 
that offered to non-disabled people; and
● maintain a mechanism which customers and 
employees can use to give feedback on the Group's 
performance and ensure that all customer comments 
are analysed, responded to and acted upon.82
B&Q’s diversity manager reports directly to the company 
chief executive, and the Kingfisher board now takes an 
active interest in the diversity strategy, which extends 
to a commitment to increase the proportion of women 
at senior manager and board level. It also includes a 
strong commitment to cultural diversity, and to people 
with disabilities as both customers and employees. The 
company reflects all this in its advertising and publicity 
material as well as its personnel and management poli-
cies, thus making diversity an important part of the busi-
ness’s brand values and public image.
The disability policy was formulated in 1998 and, like 
the age policy, it links the importance of understanding 
and integrating disability issues into the business strat-
egy. The twin goals are to remove barriers that make 
working and shopping at B&Q difficult for disabled peo-
ple. Similarly, the cultural diversity strategy at B&Q goes 
beyond simple compliance measures to ensure that the 
company does not breach the law. In 2001 the company 
discovered that over 1,000 of its staff were bilingual, 
and that between them they spoke over sixty languages 
other than English, including British Sign Language. Staff 
are actively encouraged to use languages other than 
English where this can help to understand and respond 
to customer needs, and many wear language badges to 
indicate this. The company produces a cultural diversity 
information pack for use in stores, together with a cal-
endar of religious and cultural festivals, which not only 
helps staff to understand customers, but assists manag-
ers with work scheduling.
What next for B&Q?
The economic downturn and the particular problems in 
the UK housing market during 2007–9 have clearly had a 
major impact on the home improvement sector gener-
ally. However, B&Q managed to retain its market share 
and generate a healthy operating profit despite this dif-
ficult trading environment. The key to B&Q’s strategy 
is its people; real staff feature heavily in its advertising 
campaigns and the company is investing in training with 
in-house versions of City and Guilds retail management 
qualifications and apprenticeships. This helps ensure all 
staff have both knowledge and confidence about all key 
areas of business, from practical DIY skills to understand-
ing finance, and underpins a key corporate objective of:
Creating employment and a brighter future for our 
people, the environment and wider communities.83

 Learning and personal development is an implicit feature of 
management and organisational behaviour. It is important to 
understand how people learn and develop their knowledge and skills 
in order to cope eﬀ ectively with the complex and changing demands of 
the workplace. Attention must be given to the management of learning 
within organisations. Managers also need to develop their personal 
development aspirations with the goals of the organisation. 
 Learning outcomes 
 After completing this chapter you should have enhanced your ability to: 
 ●  explain the importance of learning and development in organisational 
behaviour; 
 ●  debate the value of diﬀ erent theories and studies about learning; 
 ●  assess the nature and importance of learning styles; 
 ●  review the importance of knowledge management and its impact on learning; 
 ●  explain the nature and importance of creativity in organisations; 
 ●  evaluate the importance of mentoring and coaching for learning and 
development; 
 ●  review the eﬀ ective management of the learning process. 
  CHAPTER 5 
 Learning and development 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Without learning, individuals will not be able to develop or cope with change and organisations will not survive. 
Whatever the required knowledge or skills of an individual, the motivation and ability to learn is arguably of greatest 
importance. 
 What do YOU think? What does learning mean to YOU and how do YOU learn best?

Part 2  The individual
The importance and significance of learning
Globalisation and technological advances have heightened the pace of change, including the 
relative importance of different occupations and skills, and transformed the way we live and 
work. Learning inevitably involves an examination of how change takes place. An understand-
ing of the ways in which people learn and develop is a fundamental feature of organisational 
behaviour and management. Learning is generally defined in terms of the acquisition of 
knowledge that leads to a relatively permanent change in behaviour, which results from experi-
ence. Individuals may experience a temporary change in behaviour because of, for example, 
maturation or ageing, or short-term factors such as tiredness or alcohol. These temporary 
changes are of a different nature to those associated with the process of learning, which results 
in knowledge or a relatively permanent change in behaviour. Learning can be a deliberate and 
formal process or an unintentional outcome of nature, activity or progression.
An understanding of how people learn is a highly significant area of study and has been of 
continual interest in the development of psychology as a science. Learning is a function of the 
inner workings of our mind and has created a number of methodological difficulties. Individu-
als differ in their learning capabilities, their style and their creative responses.
Imagine, for example, these scenarios:
● a student attending an action learning set;
● a person undertaking a fork-lift truck driving lesson;
● a trainee observing a manager deal with an irate customer;
● a nurse measuring blood pressure for the first time;
● a manager completing a learning portfolio;
● an older employee introduced to a new financial computer system.
These scenarios all share the common feature that learning has taken or is about to take 
place. They demonstrate that a discussion of learning involves not only knowledge and skills, 
but also attitudes and social behaviour. Learning implies a different internal state, which may 
result in new behaviours and actions (e.g. a new skill such as taking blood pressure) or new 
understanding and knowledge (e.g. a new subject area such as finance). Sometimes behaviour 
and knowledge coincide (e.g. learning a language, becoming IT literate); at other times people 
will learn to act in certain ways without an underlying understanding of the reasons why 
(e.g. operating machinery without an understanding of its mechanical features).
Individual learning is a lifelong process that is essential if people are to be able to cope 
with the changing nature of work organisations. Payne and Whittaker, for example, stress the 
importance of skills for the future and lifelong learning.
Lifelong learning will be the only way to keep abreast of the pace of change in a technolog-
ical age, requiring flexible labour markets that operate in an increasingly global economy. 
Lifetime careers will become a rarity in the future, and the way that people are able to deal 
with this is by reskilling through lifelong learning. Business can only be competitive with 
a highly skilled, highly educated workforce. Lifelong learning and self-development will 
increase an individual’s employment prospects and provide business with the skills it needs.1
Learning and the social world
Much of what we learn takes place without any necessary deliberations or assessments. 
Learning can be seen to be a continuous and automatic process, often taking place in a social 
context. The spontaneous nature of learning can be observed in young children’s play as they 
imitate and model their behaviour and attitudes on the people around them. Learning has an 
active and dynamic nature. As active participants, we engage and relate to the people around 
us. Our ability to learn will be affected by both our innate potential and our social experiences.
Learning, therefore, links the individual to the social world and is both a personal and 
a social experience. Often, learning is an event that is shared with others. The process may 

Chapter 5  Learning and development
153
be a deliberate sharing of information or guiding behaviour – as, for example, in the par-
ent–child relationship when parents are attempting to socialise the child into acceptable 
ways of behaving, or in organisations where new members are taught opening phrases 
when answering the telephone. At other times it is the actual sharing of the learning expe-
rience – going through the same learning process – that makes the process challenging 
and valuable. It is through the support of others that individuals can find both strength 
and rewards.
Learning occurs in many ways; information or skills may be imparted quite explicitly and 
at the same time the implicit values and attitudes of the trainer will also be communicated. 
Learning is a rich experience. At times we may be learning ‘incidentally’ as we acquire, process 
and remember information automatically. (See also the ­discussion on mentoring as part of the 
learning process, later in this chapter.)
When learning is work it is ineffective – look at all the executives ‘forced’ to go on training 
courses. The learning that sticks has a joy of discovery, playfulness. Many executives have 
been to brainstorming seminars where an atmosphere of deliberate playfulness often stimu-
lates high levels of executive learning for an hour or so. Corporations of the future are going 
to need to find ways to extend that hour to cover the entire working day.2
Learning and emotions
Learning implies that an individual has experienced ‘something’, has stored that experience 
and is able to refer to and/or use it at a later time. Learning and memory are inextricably 
linked. There are many factors that influence both the rate and enjoyment of learning (see 
Figure 5.1). The rewards and punishments levelled at us in the past will affect our motivation 
and attitudes towards learning in the present and the future. Expectations of others and the 
climate that surrounds us will determine our readiness to learn.
Figure 5.1  Factors influencing the learning process

154
part 2 tHe individUaL
 Feelings generated by the process of learning are very powerful and often tend to be pleasur-
able. A sense of achievement that often accompanies the completion of a learning process can 
lead to an enhancement of an individual’s self-worth and esteem. However, learning can also 
be an uncomfortable experience; it can ‘shake an individual’s comfort zones’; it can  provide 
new and alarming perceptions and can be disruptive and anxiety-provoking. An illustration of 
this has been noted by trainers in diversity, who need to challenge individuals’ attitudes and 
perceptions when there is evidence of prejudice: 
 Learning to learn about diversity can be, and may even have to be, a painful process. It is 
not a comfortable experience to learn that we have prejudices we need to deal with. It is not 
comfortable to fi nd that our own view of the world is just one of many and those other views 
are equally valid. 3 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 testing  what has been learned is ingrained in our society and accounts largely for the ways in which individuals are 
compared and judged. this is too short-sighted. Far more attention should be given to  why or  how a person has 
learned. 
 What is YOUR critical assessment of this contention? How would YOU attempt to monitor the why and how 
of learning? 
 A declaration on learning 
 Eight distinguished scholars on learning in organisations launched a declaration summarising 
their collective thoughts on the nature of learning, its benefi ts and what should be done about 
learning. They singled out learning as a key process for individuals, organisations and for soci-
ety as a whole for the twenty-fi rst century. They believe that it is too easy to take learning for 
granted and treat it as an automatic part of the human condition. They claim that individuals 
frequently do not organise or plan their learning and they leave the evaluation of learning to 
chance. Typically, individuals fail to check what exactly they can do better or diff erently as a 
result of the learning experience. 4 Two parts of the declaration are shown in  Table  5.1 . 
 Organisations and the management of learning 
 If learning can result in the benefi ts outlined by  Burgoyne et al. in  Table  5.1 , it is clearly in the 
organisation’s best interest to ensure it utilises the knowledge and skills of all its employees. 
But how do organisations achieve these outcomes? It is surprising to observe that in some 
organisations learning is still left to chance. The individual employee is expected to ‘pick 
up’ behaviour, attitudes and skills. Much learning appears to come about as a natural con-
sequence of the demands of the job, overcoming problems and interactions with colleagues. 
That is, learning achieved through experience. 
 It becomes diffi  cult, therefore, to separate how learning occurs without taking some 
account of the relationship between employee and manager and the general climate of the 
organisation  (discussed in  Chapter  15 ). In the past, organisations may have relied largely on 
the stability of the organisation structure for knowledge transmission. Managers would tend 
to know who to go to for advice and would seek out the older and experienced employees who 
held the ‘know-how’. This knowledge and wisdom, accumulated over years of work, was a 
precious store of information. However, such a store was rarely formalised or articulated and 
would be communicated only on an informal basis. Communication to the next generation 
of employees was an important part of the organisation’s culture and socialisation process. 

Chapter 5  Learning and development
155
Older employees were useful as a source of knowledge and guidance for younger ones. Many 
held the role of an informal mentor and were much appreciated by their younger subordinates. 
(Mentoring and coaching are discussed later in this chapter.)
Practices such as downsizing and outsourcing have had a major effect on this layer of expe-
rienced employees. Not only are relationships disrupted by the restructuring of the business, 
but also there is the potential for the complete loss of this powerful and important reservoir of 
knowledge and understanding.
Learning: the central issue for the twenty-first century
The benefits
Learning is the most powerful, engaging, rewarding 
and enjoyable aspect of our personal and collective 
experience. The ability to learn about learning and 
become masters of the learning process is the critical 
issue for the next century
The following benefits assume that the learning in 
question has both morally acceptable intent and 
outcome:
Our understanding of learning has generally been 
restricted to formal teaching and training. It is often 
seen as unrelated to daily life and work. Systems of 
accreditation are sometimes used as a way of unfairly 
discriminating between individuals and are often 
felt to be irrelevant to real needs. The biggest missed 
opportunity for policy-makers and leaders is the failure to 
capitalise on the collective learning ability of people
For individuals
● 	 Learning is the key to developing a person’s potential
● 	 Learning to learn is the key to effective learning
● 	 Learning enables the individual to meet the demands 
of change
● 	 The capacity to learn is an asset that never becomes 
obsolete
● 	 Embracing learning helps the individual to 
acknowledge that learning is more than formal 
education and training
Organisational leaders need to harness relevant 
knowledge and experience so that the organisation as a 
whole and the people who comprise it can learn more 
effectively. The same principle applies at community, 
national and international levels. Every person, team and 
organisation both survives and progresses through the 
ability to internalise and act upon this fundamental truth
For organisations
● 	 Learning increases everyone’s capacity to contribute to 
the success of organisations
● 	 Learning enables the organisation to be more effective 
in meeting its goals
● 	 Learning emancipates the organisation through 
clarification of purpose, vision, values and behaviour
● 	 A focus on learning, planned and unplanned, formal 
and informal, produces a wider range of solutions to 
organisational issues
● 	 Learning helps to achieve a better balance between 
long-term organisational effectiveness and short-term 
organisational efficiency
This declaration does not contain all there is to say on the 
subject of learning. It does, however, reflect the thinking 
of the eight signatories. The declaration is designed to 
stimulate and encourage dialogue
For society
● 	 Society survives and thrives through learning
● 	 A focus on capturing and sharing learning contributes 
to a more cohesive society
● 	 Individual and collective learning reinforces the 
informed, conscious and discriminating choices that 
underpin democracy
● 	 Learning helps to enhance the capacity of individuals 
to create a more fulfilled society

 How do people learn? 
 Early classic studies of learning off er explanations for simple learning situations. The prin-
ciples arising from these laboratory experiments remain applicable to an understanding of 
organisational behaviour. The eff ects of rewards and punishment (the ways in which behav-
iour can be shaped and modifi ed) have considerable relevance in understanding the motivation 
of individuals and the culture of organisations.  These are called behaviourist theories. 
 Dissatisfaction with the earliest theories led researchers to consider more complex learn-
ing situations.  Cognitive theories of learning have particular application to an understanding 
of individual diff erences in learning situations. They off er models that explain the process of 
learning and take into account diff erent preferences and styles. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 the world of computer games is now advancing fast in the new digital culture. they help stimulate literacy, improve 
problem-solving and develop hand-to-eye co-ordination. individuals can connect across different continents and in 
different time zones. 
 Do YOU agree that the future of learning is clearly playful? To what extent would YOU encourage the use of  computer 
games for students? 
 Behaviourist approach to learning 
 Theories of learning have their roots in the history of psychology, and some of the earli-
est experimental psychologists focused their attention on animal learning and were keen to 
develop laws of learning. They were interested only in behaviour that could be objectively 
measured and they designed experiments that maximised key scientifi c conditions:  control, 
reliability and  validity. A school of psychology called  behaviourism developed out of these 
early research studies. As the name suggests, researchers were interested in the study of behav-
iour and those actions that could be observed, measured and controlled. Ideas and thoughts 
in people’s minds were considered inaccessible to objective, scientifi c measurement and were 
therefore excluded from study. 
 Exercise and association 
 Watson developed the  Law of Exercise and Association. This refers to the process that occurs 
when two responses are connected and repeatedly exercised. Watson was particularly inter-
ested in the study of fi xed habits and routines. 5 In organisational life we can see evidence of 
this in the habits and routines at work. These behaviours can become ‘locked in’, believed to 
be ‘the only way’ of completing certain tasks – a part of cultural life; it is as if they are fi xed 
into beds of concrete. Speech is a further illustration of our routine habits. The predictability 
of a greeting provides acknowledgement of our existence – when people say ‘How are you?’ 
they do not expect to be given a rundown of your medical history. The rhetorical question is 
really saying, ‘Hello – I see, acknowledge and recognise you.’ 
 Classical conditioning 
 Pavlov, 6 working in Russia, developed a theory called  classical conditioning . His laboratory 
experiments demonstrated how instinctive refl exes, such as salivation, could be ‘conditioned’ 
to respond to a new situation and a new stimulus ( see  Figure  5.2 ). Pavlov, through his repeated 

Chapter 5  Learning and development
157
experimental studies, showed the power and strength of association. How can we relate these 
experiments on dogs to behaviour at work? There are times when our body responds more 
quickly than our mind. We may have an initial panic reaction to a situation without necessar-
ily realising why. Physiological reactions may be appropriate in times of stressful situations – 
our body may be in a state of readiness to run (fight or flight reaction).
At other times our reactions may be ‘conditioned’ because of previous associations of pain, 
guilt or fear. Smells and sounds are particularly evocative and may release physiological reac-
tions akin to the Pavlovian experiments. Thus, sitting in a waiting room at the dentist’s and 
hearing the sound of the drill may invoke an increase in our blood pressure or heart rate – 
nothing to do with any actual pain we may be experiencing. Returning to school for a parents’ 
evening may invoke feelings of ‘dread’ or ‘pleasure’ depending on our own childhood experi-
ences of school and its associations. Training for some occupations may depend upon learned 
associations and automatic reactions, an example being initial military training. If fire drills 
are to be successful, immediate reaction to the bell or siren is essential.
Law of Effect
Thorndike’s work drew attention to the outcomes of learning – the Law of Effect. All learning 
is a process of stimulus–response (S–R). The strength of the S–R link is dependent upon the 
extent to which the experience is pleasurable. Behaviour that results in a favourable outcome is 
more likely to be repeated. Thorndike watched animals in new situations and noted how they 
learned to adapt successfully to the environment. He noted that in his experiments there were 
Figure 5.2  Classical conditioning

158
Part 2  The individual
no flashes of insight shown but learning would occur by trial and error. Over time these cor-
rect responses were ‘stamped in’. If an action was successful and led to a reward, the behaviour 
was more likely to be repeated.7
Operant conditioning
Skinner advanced the ideas of Thorndike and produced a thesis of operant conditioning. 
­Skinner’s experiments on animals showed the effects of reward and punishment on animal 
learning. Unlike classical conditioning, learning was rewarded after the response had occurred. 
He proved that a response would be learned when the animal associated the behavioural 
response with a reward (or reinforcement) and could be broken with punishment. Partial rein-
forcement strengthened the S–R bond and the behaviour was more resistant to extinction. The 
reward seemed to hold even greater importance when it was given intermittently.8
Negative reinforcement was also shown to be powerful. These experiments demonstrated 
the importance of the S–R bond, but the reward was the prevention of something painful or 
nasty occurring. Not being shocked is the reward in such experiments. Negative reinforcement 
is not punishment. Punishment is trying to break the stimulus–reward bond.
Skinner and his researchers applied operant conditioning theory to many experimental sit-
uations. They demonstrated the power and control of simple learning principles: the identifi-
cation of a stimulus and a reward following a successful response. Skinner and colleagues were 
able to train animals to perform complex acts by a process known as ‘shaping’. Behaviour is 
shaped through a series of small but successive steps, with rewards given for those responses 
that approximate the desired end result.
Operant conditioning in work situations
The technique of shaping (modifying and controlling behaviour) and the identification of the 
S–R bond can be applied to work situations. Illustrations of the power of rewards can be seen 
in almost any work organisation – for example, bonuses, commission, prizes for reaching sales 
targets and ‘employee of the month’ awards.
Intermittent reinforcement is another useful outcome of Skinner’s research. If an employee 
always receives a reward, does its value diminish? Skinner’s research would say ‘yes’. There is 
an interesting parallel with this concept in transactional analysis, whereby too many positive 
verbal comments (called strokes) are described as ‘marshmallow throwing’.9 (Transactional 
analysis is discussed in Chapter 6.)
A difficult problem with the application of operant conditioning is that Skinner was deal-
ing with ‘hungry’ animals; they had a clear drive to eat and therefore a plate of food was, no 
doubt, a reward. It is far more complex when we consider rewards for people. We may all 
have our own definitions of a ‘reward’. Although money might be a suitable reward for some 
employees, others may prefer to have ‘time out’ or a symbolic gesture of the work they have 
achieved. So having a photograph on public display may be a proud and rewarding moment 
for some but other employees may be acutely embarrassed. How organisations reward their 
employees makes a statement about what they value. How different pay practices affect organ-
isational and individual performance is a critical aspect of reward management.
The same principle applies to people’s perception of punishment. Inappropriate behaviour 
at work can be punished directly by, for example, withholding rewards or by initiating the 
company’s disciplinary procedure. Some managerial actions may be perceived as punishment, 
for example being sent on a training course or not being sent on an international assignment. 
Whether the punishment is real or perceived, it is likely to cause feelings of resentment in 
the mind of the employee. Hence, punishment results in negative psychological outcomes. 
Although the employee may comply with requirements, it is likely that resentment will lead to 
anger and/or apathy and psychological revenge.
Some organisations endeavour to exercise tight control over their employees’ language 
and behaviour. Training new employees is a form of ‘shaping’ behaviour in line with written 

Chapter 5 Learning and deveLopment
159
training objectives. As employees demonstrate their responses, they may be rewarded with a 
tick in the training box or a ‘badge’ that they wear on their clothing. Learning occurs incre-
mentally, with the task divided into sub-goals, each with its own reward. Sometimes shaping 
can occur in training centres where peer assessment can add further power to the modifi cation 
process.  See also the discussion on organisational behaviour modiﬁ cation in  Chapter  7 . 
 Social learning 
 Supporters of the behavioural school appear to have neglected the infl uence of broader social 
interactions. Developing the work of Skinner,  Bandura drew attention to the importance 
of environmental infl uences on observable behaviour.  Social learning theory is based on the 
premise that people learn by observing and interacting with others and through imitation. 
Even aggressive behaviour can arguably be learned by imitation. The concept of  self-eﬃ  cacy 
refers to a person’s perception of themselves and a belief in their ability to act in a particular 
way and successfully achieve a task. 10  People with a high level of self-effi  cacy tend to exhibit 
high work performance without becoming stressed. 
 People learn by watching others. The term ‘modelling’ was coined by  Miller and Dollard to 
explain learning by imitating others and ‘role models’ as a label for those individuals who are 
held up as examples of good practice. 11 So, the trainees observing how to prepare a souﬄ  é will 
imitate the actions of their role model. Interpersonal skills can also be learned by observation, 
and new recruits, by watching others, will ‘pick up’ the habits and techniques of those around 
them. Miller and Dollard’s research brought attention to cognitive functions of thinking, per-
ception, attention and memory in addition to behavioural responses. So, for instance, a trainee 
watching a supervisor deal with a customer complaint would need to attend to the customer’s 
emotions, note the reaction of the supervisor and learn how the ‘lessons’ of this interaction 
could be applied to another situation. 
 Social learning also relates to standards of behaviour and action expected from members 
of the organisation by observing and imitating, for example working within the hierarchical 
structure, how to address other members of staff , physical appearanceor or acceptance of the 
 psychological contract. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Social learning theory is a simplification. not all learning is a direct result of imitating others. indeed, the concept of 
self-efficacy suggests that people with a strong belief in their own ability will discover and learn much for themselves. 
 What is YOUR view of the validity of social learning theory? Do YOU have a high level of self-efficacy? 
  Cognitive theories of learning 
 Focusing only on behaviour is useful but limited and cannot explain all forms of learning. The 
understanding and application of basic factual knowledge can arguably be learned through 
operant conditioning, for example computer-based training for call-centre staff . However, 
more advanced levels of learning require more active brain processes. The inner mind has par-
ticular relevance to understanding how, what and why people learn. Personality, perceptions, 
motivations and attitudes will all play their part in helping or hindering the learning process. 
 Behaviourism cannot easily explain the natural curiosity that humans have, the great desire 
to learn, to make sense of their environment and to feel competent in activities. Neither can it 
explain the extent of incidental learning that takes place. Observing changes in behaviour is 

160
Part 2  The individual
only part of the learning process. To understand how and why people learn, attention must be 
given to myriad individual factors including plans, ambitions and goals.
Research conducted in the last century highlighted the fact that the process of learning 
was more complex than simple S–R associations. Tolman showed that rats allowed to wander 
freely through a maze to find food were capable of learning an image (a cognitive map) of the 
maze that they would use at a later time if their initial route was blocked.12
Learning styles
Learning styles indicate various approaches to, or methods of, learning and the ways in which 
people learn. This approach recognises that individuals have their own learning style and 
strategy. This influences how people prefer to learn. Some cognitive theorists have emphasised 
the cyclical nature of learning and its active nature. Davis13 claims that ‘experiential learning is 
an integration and alteration of thinking and doing’. Although there are a number of models 
of learning style, two of the best known and useful are that of David Kolb and that of Honey 
and Mumford.
The Kolb learning cycle
Kolb’s learning cycle (see Figure 5.3) is typical of this approach and is one used frequently in 
the management literature.14 It provides useful insights into the nature of learning:
● It demonstrates that there is no end to learning but only another turn of the cycle.
● Learners are not passive recipients but need actively to explore and test the environment.
● It identifies the importance of reflection and internalisation.
● It is a useful way of identifying problems in the learning process.
The approach emphasises the importance of the synthesis between individuals’ behaviour 
and the evaluation of their actions. Reflection on what has been learned in order to experiment 
with new situations and to become aware of new possibilities is a vital part of the learning 
process. This is the very essence of action learning: going through the cycle that learners are 
exposed to, applying, reflecting and testing out their learning. This encourages in individuals

Chapter 5  Learning and development
161
habits compatible with the notion of lifelong learning. It is therefore no surprise that Kolb 
addresses his ideas to managers and suggests that experiential learning will enable managers 
to cope with change and complexity.
Kolb and his colleagues suggest that partnerships between education and industry should 
create feedback loops that enable interactions between ideas and action – certainly ideas 
that fit well into a learning organisation framework and into the concept of knowledge 
­management, considered below.
Action learning
Learning includes social learning and also has a reflective element as members are asked to 
reflect on their experience and learning. Typically, action learning involves a small group of 
learners (action learning set) meeting regularly to undertake a practical, organisational-based 
project. It is based on real work issues and designed to help develop both the manager and 
the organisation. Action learning involves participants working together to find solutions to 
actual problems and reflecting on their experiences.
According to the CIPD, action learning can enhance the way people learn. Group mem-
bers may increase their capacity to respond to new situations. By drawing on real work prac-
tices and working together, the set can encourage group members to apply new ideas to their 
role and help make changes to their current or future roles, or tackle joint projects.15 Action 
­learning can therefore be seen as relevant to group development and performance.
The emphasis is on learning and self-evaluation by doing, with advice and support from 
tutors and other course members. It is therefore essentially a learner-driven process. Action 
learning can be contentious compared with traditional programmed knowledge of develop-
ment. There may be no formal structure and the process demands flexibility, with attention 
focused on questioning and challenging. The process can be daunting for some people and a 
supportive atmosphere is essential. However, Gitsham maintains that experiential learning is 
one of the most effective ways to build leadership skills: ‘Action learning and learning through 
projects where you are in the real world engaging with people is very valuable.’16
Yukl refers to action learning as an approach often used for combining formal training with 
learning from experience. An alternative approach is to link projects to a process of mutual coach-
ing and mentoring. Project participants identify their own learning objects and the group meets 
periodically to devise solutions to problems, evaluate progress and discuss what was learned.17
Honey and Mumford styles of learning
When applying the learning cycle to the study of individual differences, Kolb demonstrated 
that individuals may have a preference for one of the key stages, and therein lies their learn-
ing style. His work, developed by Honey and Mumford, has been applied to managerial 
­behaviour.18 Kolb identified four different styles of learning:
● accommodative – strong preference for concrete experiences and active experimentation 
(hands-on);
● divergent – preference for concrete experiences, but to reflect on these from different perspectives;
● assimilative – prefers to swing between reflection and conceptualisation and will use 
­inductive reasoning to develop new theory;
● convergent – prefers to apply ideas, will take an idea and test it out in practice.
Honey and Mumford simplified Kolb’s learning cycle and refined his learning-style question-
naire. They also identify four learning styles and associated patterns of behaviour:19
● Activists – What’s new? I’m game for anything. Activists are enthusiastic, flexible and open-
minded. They like the challenge of new experiences, but can become bored with long-term 
routine procedures. Activists enjoy the here and now. They tend to think first and consider 
consequences later.

162
Part 2  The individual
● Reflectors – I’d like time to think about this. Reflectors are cautious and slow to reach 
conclusions. They stand back and observe and like to think things through carefully. By col-
lection and analysis they maintain a big-picture perspective. At discussions and meetings, 
reflectors prefer to adopt a low profile and take a back seat.
● Theorists – How does this relate to that? Theorists are logical and disciplined, and value 
rationality and objectivity. They assimilate disparate facts in order to understand coher-
ent theories. Theorists tend to be perfectionists and reject subjectivity, lateral thinking or 
flippancy.
● Pragmatists – How can I apply this in practice? Pragmatists like to experiment and seek and 
try new ideas or theories. They enjoy challenges and problem-solving. Pragmatists are prac-
tical, down to earth, quick to make decisions and quickly bored with long-term discussions.
The researchers claim that an understanding of one’s learning style will enhance learning 
effectiveness, whether as a trainee or as a tutor. Although all styles are necessary, individu-
als tend to be more comfortable with and focus on one particular style. An integrated and 
­effective learner will be equipped to manage all four styles, even though the learner may have a 
preference for one. Knowing your learning style may help avoid repeated mistakes by attempt-
ing activities to enhance alternative styles. For example, if you tend to ‘jump in at the deep 
end’, consider spending time reflecting on experiences before taking action.
Other studies
Other studies have also shown links between personality and learning and have found, for 
example, that introverts and extroverts differ with respect to punishment and reward. Whereas 
introverts are more likely to be affected by punishment, extroverts’ performance is enhanced 
by reward.20 They also differ with respect to their retention of short- and long-term material; 
extroverts tend to have a better performance at short-term intervals whereas the reverse is true 
for introverts.
Studies using the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (discussed in Chapter 4) also reveal differ-
ences in learning preferences for the sixteen personality types. Such differences indicate that 
introverts work best if they can think before participating or ask questions before completing 
tasks or exercises, whereas extroverts work best if they can interact in a small group and/
or talk the lesson over with other individuals. However, some of the interesting research has 
been completed on the interaction between trainer and trainee. Thus, an extroverted trainer 
who is also high on ‘sensing’ may positively evaluate students who are active, energetic and 
practical, but may overlook the thoughtful, introspective and conceptual students.21 Such stud-
ies highlight the necessity for trainers not only to be sensitive to the personality needs of the 
group of trainees, but also to be aware of the impact their own personality has on the learning 
experience.
Mayo and Lank suggest that organisations need to recognise the simple fact that different 
people learn in different ways and should take the following actions:
● give people the opportunity to discover their most natural learning style;
● offer learning opportunities that suit people with different learning styles;
● recognise the need to complete the full learning cycle;
● help people to translate the learning cycle into an upwards continuous spiral of learning.22
Complex models of learning
Given the complexity of learning, how can managers make the best sense of the theories, 
concepts and frameworks? Models of learning such as that shown in Figure 5.4 are inevitably 
complex. However, the model might stimulate questions and could help in the preparation 
and design of learning programmes. For example, has sufficient consideration been given to 
the abilities of employees, learning styles and the best methods to be used?

 E-learning 
 Learning via technology –  e-learning – is now a global phenomenon and is central to many 
organisations. It is not diffi  cult to see why online learning is growing in popularity. It off ers 
the opportunity to provide a standard message to a large number of widely geographically 
dispersed people with the minimum disruption to their working and private lives. And, where 
large numbers of learners are involved, learning materials delivered online can bring the cost 
per learner to negligible proportions. Thus, learning becomes more accessible than ever before. 
There is an increasing use of technology as a means of enhancing the learning situation. 
 The Chartered Management Institute provides the following explanation of e-learning: 
   The facilitation of learning through the Internet, or an intranet. E-learning, short for 
 electronic learning, is a development from computer-based training, and comprises self-
contained learning materials, and resources, that can be used at the pace, and convenience, 
of the learner. An e-learning package normally incorporates some form of test which can 
demonstrate how much an e-learner has assimilated from a course, as well as some form 
of monitoring to enable managers to check the usage of the system e-learning. Successful

 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Learning is an instinctive process and people will only learn if they want to. psychological studies of how people 
learn and learning styles have limited relevance in the classroom and even less practical application to the work 
situation. 
 How would YOU present a counterargument? How well do YOU learn? 

164
Part 2  The individual
e-learning depends largely on self-motivation of individuals to study effectively. Since it is 
Internet-based, it has the potential to respond to a company’s rapidly changing needs, and 
offer new learning opportunities relevant to a company’s new position very quickly.23
E-learning can be used in a variety of contexts with varying amounts of personal interac-
tion. For example, with some university courses the majority of study is undertaken online 
with minimal attendance at campus or face-to-face tuition. However, in business organisations, 
technological and culture barriers appear to hinder the widespread uptake of online learning.
For many students, there are a number of potential benefits associated with e-learning includ-
ing: open access to education and flexibility in location and timing; quicker delivery of training; 
individuals can proceed at their own pace; acquiring computer skills; and monitoring and feed-
back on activities. Potential disadvantages include: concerns over quality of content; maintain-
ing motivation and danger of procrastination; and lack of teamworking and social interaction.
The challenge involved in e-learning is not simply teaching in a different way. Rather, it 
means rethinking the whole nature of the teaching/learning process. It is clear that e-learning 
is more appropriate for the acquisition of knowledge and there are doubts about its applica-
tion to training in social skills. Despite all of these reservations, as communications technol-
ogy develops and as people want to learn exactly what they need to know, with the minimum 
disruption to their lives, e-learning will become an increasingly significant part of training, 
either pre-course preparation or post-course evaluation and refreshment of knowledge.
Knowledge management
As mentioned previously, it is clearly in the best interests of the organisation to develop the 
knowledge and skills of its employees. Learning at the individual or group level impacts on 
the learning, development and performance of the organisation as a whole, and the process of 
learning is influenced by the general climate of the organisation. An increasingly important 
aspect of organisational performance is the idea of knowledge management. This is usu-
ally defined in terms of a range of practices or processes to identify, create, distribute and 
share knowledge throughout the organisation.24 Growth will continue as more collaborative 
IT applications become available. Knowledge management is related to business strategy, IT, 
human resource management and people management, and can therefore be linked to organi-
sational learning (discussed in Chapter 16).
Explicit and tacit knowledge
Nonaka argues that competitive advantage is founded in the ability of companies to create 
new forms of knowledge and translate this knowledge into innovative action. He says that ‘the 
one sure source of lasting competitive advantage is knowledge’, and describes the different 
kinds of knowledge that exist in organisations and the ways in which knowledge can be trans-
lated into action.25 Nonaka distinguishes explicit and tacit knowledge.
● Explict knowledge is that held consciously in mental focus by an individual. It is easily 
communicated, quantified and available to others in various forms such as language, math-
ematical expression or printed matter.
● Tacit knowledge, however, is internalised and an individual may not be consciously aware 
of it. It is personal and specific to the individual and more akin to wisdom that is inarticu-
late, understood but rarely described. Although more problematic, because it is not so eas-
ily disseminated, tacit knowledge is arguably as important as explicit knowledge.
According to Nonaka, those companies able to use both kinds of knowledge will make the 
creative breakthroughs. He suggests that the knowledge-creating companies systematically 
ensure that the tacit and explicit feed into each other in a spiral of knowledge. Tacit knowledge 

Chapter 5  Learning and development
165
is converted into explicit knowledge by articulation and that explicit knowledge is used within 
an individual’s cognitive understanding by a process of internalisation. It perhaps is no sur-
prise that ‘knowledge management’ has been the subject of hype in the management literature 
and has been extolled as the route to the holy grail of competitive advantage.
The importance of knowledge management
Tan argues that managing knowledge is now the issue for business in the twenty-first century. 
He suggests that:
A successful company is a knowledge-creating company: that is one which is able consist-
ently to produce new knowledge, to disseminate it throughout the company and to embody 
it into new products or services quickly.26
Santosus and Surmacz suggest that a ‘creative approach to knowledge management (KM) 
can result in improved efficiency, higher productivity and increased revenues in practically any 
business function’.27
A substantial number of benefits have been identified by researchers of KM that no doubt have 
contributed to the surge of interest. Kerr identifies seven reasons why KM is an important area:
● business pressure on innovation;
● inter-organisational enterprises (e.g. mergers, takeovers, etc.);
● networked organisations and the need to co-ordinate geographically dispersed groups;
● increasingly complex products and services with a significant knowledge component;
● hyper-competitive marketplace (decreasing life cycles and time to market);
● digitisation of business environments and IT revolution;
● concerns about the loss of knowledge due to increasing staff mobility, staff attrition and 
retirements.28
The Chartered Management Institute points out that knowledge has become a key strate-
gic asset in a knowledge-based economy, and every organisation that values knowledge must 
invest in developing the best strategy for identifying and applying the knowledge assets it 
needs to succeed.
Managing knowledge systematically and professionally can bring many benefits to an 
organisation. These include the ability to learn from past failures and avoid repeating them or 
reinventing solutions which have previously proved to be inadequate. KM can also be a driver 
of new ideas leading to the creation of new products, services and solutions.29
McLean suggests that although many early management techniques have been relegated to 
the vaults of history, KM shows no sign of disappearing from boardroom discussion. KM has 
become a major driver of organisational change and wealth creation.
Knowledge management aims to empower individuals and organisations to deal with real-
life problems and issues which they face on a day-to-day basis. It also challenges them to 
identify ways in which they can ‘know what they know’ and use that conscious knowledge to 
assist their organisations to be a competitive force against rivals.30
Embedded within the business
From an examination of the changing shape of knowledge-sharing practices in organisations, 
Burton refers to an argument about whether (KM) is dead or that it is a ‘live’ discipline that 
has adapted and evolved. Pure KM focuses on unlocking the knowledge in people’s heads for 
the greater corporate good, or simply getting those people working and talking together, often 
cross-functionally, for the greater corporate good.
Criticisms of KM include that it can morph into a version of content management; it rap-
idly becomes a specialist discipline with practitioners talking in abstract terms; and many 

166
part 2 tHe individUaL
of its supporters have become over-theoretical and insuffi  ciently focused on tangible busi-
ness benefi t. Principles of KM need to be built into a company’s overall business strategy and 
require the buy-in of senior management. 
 Most companies now realise that knowledge management is something that has to be 
embedded within the business. It is not something where you can bring in a specialist team 
and they will manage all your knowledge for you. 31 
 The success of KM would depend on the culture of the organisation and its priority in sharing 
learning and knowledge, and has roots in the learning organisation  (discussed in  Chapter  16 ). 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Knowledge management (Km) appears to be widely accepted as an important feature of improved organisational 
performance. However, in reality it is a very nebulous concept. Km means different things to different people and it 
is difficult to implement in a meaningful and rewarding way. 
 What is YOUR opinion of the practical value of KM? How effective is KM in your own university or organisation? 
 Talent management 
 Recent years have seen the emergence of the concept of  talent management as a strategic 
approach to gaining competitive advantage. The Chartered Management Institute defi nes tal-
ent management in its broadest terms as ‘the selection, development, engagement and reten-
tion of individuals, who are seen to be of particular value to an organisation’: 
 The development of talented employees can be one of the most profi table investments an 
organization makes. As long-term organizational performance is achieved primarily through 
a focus on people, it is fundamental that talented personnel are identifi ed, nurtured and, 
most importantly, retained within an organization. Investment in ‘human capital’ develops 
the skills, knowledge and vision needed to take an organization forward and can help to meet 
strategic objectives, maintain competitive advantage within the marketplace and ensure the 
long-term success and viability of the organisation. 32 
 Talent management is inextricably linked with the human capital management approach, 
with these particularly valuable individuals being seen as assets who should be invested into 
via development, appropriate planned deployment and engagement and retention initiatives. 
The competitive advantage secured is normally measured through indicators such as improved 
retention and succession planning of high performers, an increased reputation as an employer 
of choice, making the organisation more attractive to work in for external talent, and other fac-
tors such as increased diversity of the workforce and ultimately the success of the organisation. 
 Talent management needs to be aligned to the direction of the organisation and it needs 
senior management endorsement if it is to succeed. Line managers need to understand the 
concept and be encouraged to view talent in their own teams as a corporate resource rather 
than be concerned about their local deployment and workload issues. 
 Blass refers to the diffi  culty in fi nding a clear defi nition of talent management. The process may 
diff er between organisations and the same activity can result in diff erent actions and/or outcomes. 
However, Blass refers to the importance of a clear strategic perspective that shapes the way an 
organisation takes to talent management and how it is viewed, implemented and operationalised. 33 
 Managing future talent 
 A report from the CIPD, in conjunction with the TUC and ACAS, draws attention to the 
development and support of young talent in the world of work. It is crucial that when a young 
person fi rst enters the workplace, the experience sets them up for a long and successful career. 

CHAPTER 5 LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT
167
For a young person, the experience of entering the workplace, adjusting to working life, and 
learning and performing new tasks can be a daunting prospect. It is important that line man-
agers responsible for young talent provide the right support and structure, and maintain good 
communications. 34

 EY provides global services in four main areas: assurance, tax, transactions and advisory. It helps clients retain the 
conﬁ dence of investors, manage their risk, strengthen their controls and achieve potential. EY is a global partnership 
employing 175,000, including 8,500 across the UK and Republic of Ireland. Research shows that if EY attracts and 
retains the best talent and develops people, it will be able to oﬀ er more innovative client solutions, thus winning in 
the market and building its brand and reputation, while also helping to attract even more talent.

manager by the end of the two years. Objectives for Career Watch are to: 
 ●  retain diverse talent into leadership; 
 ●  remove and/or avoid roadblocks in people’s career journeys; 
 ●  develop both the watchee and watcher;  
 ●  provoke organisational learning and change.

 Creativity 
 With a continuing complex, turbulent and uncertain environment, a creative organisational 
culture is essential in order to maintain competitive advantage. For organisations to be innova-
tive, creative solutions are required. Organisations need to recruit employees with the poten-
tial for both development and creativity. There are numerous defi nitions of  creativity but it is 
defi ned generally, for example by  Goodman , in terms such as ‘the process of generating new 
ideas or concepts’ or more specifi cally such as ‘the application of imaginative thought which 
results in innovative solutions to many problems’. 
 Goodman suggests that:  ‘ Actively creative people have a talent for getting to the heart of 
a problem. They are not confused by detail and by the need to invoke standard approaches.’ 
There tends to be consensus in the literature that suggests such individuals have a desire for 
originality, non-conformity and the opportunity to experiment and express new ideas. A dif-
ference can also be drawn between those people who are productive in terms of the number of 
ideas they can create and those individuals who have entrepreneurial capabilities and are able 
to bring the ideas to the marketplace. 35 
 Creativity is often linked with innovation but this term is generally associated with the 
development of new products or services. For example,  Gurteen views creativity as essentially 
about generating ideas while innovation is about implementing these ideas and turning them 
into reality. 36

The importance of managing creativity is emphasised by, for example, the Chartered Man-
agement Institute:
An organisation’s ability to innovate by developing and utilising people’s creativity and gen-
erating new ideas is considered a key to competitive advantage, particularly in the context of 
rapid change in business and society. It is vital for organisations to foster and manage creativ-
ity and innovation on an ongoing basis to help them achieve and sustain success.37
Promoting a culture of creativity
The importance of creativity as a management skill has received increasing attention in recent 
years, lending a so-called soft edge of organisational behaviour to the business literature. Stra-
tegic management writers suggest that managers will be required to go beyond rational/logical 
thinking and use their senses of feeling, creativity and intuition to create businesses for the 
future. The Creative Model of management is:
built on the philosophical assumption that the real world which surrounds the organisation is a 
dynamic construct enacted by the members of the organisation over time . . . they will require 
a diverse group of senior managers able to perceive the world differently, yet able to participate 
in a process that transcends these different views to enact a complex organisational reality.38
Such a view suggests that personality, sensitivity, creativity and communication skills are going 
to be the requirements of managers in the future. It also requires managers to be proactive in 
their search for root causes to problems and be imaginative in solving them.
In order to promote creativity employees must feel motivated and there must be a supporting 
environmental climate and organisation structures. Managers and supervisors need to adopt a 
style of behaviour and leadership based on openness, respect and trust that ­encourages the genera-
tion and implementation of new ideas. See transformational or creative leadership in Chapter 9.
Imaginative thought may lead to new ways of seeing things that may be novel for the person 
or completely novel in time. According to Burton, ‘creativity is often viewed as a talent which 
resides only in a few and many managers will not see it necessarily as part of their role. In the 
21st Century workplace, as well as building on existing knowledge, we need to develop new 
cultures which focus on developing creativity in everyone.’ Burton refers to two parts of our 
imagination: synthetic imagination, which enables us to analyse previous and imagined sce-
narios based on that experience and knowledge; and creative imagination, which enables us to 
develop completely new and different ideas and concepts to solve problems and achieve goals.
Traditional management culture often trusts what comes from the synthetic imagination 
above the creative imagination, as these ideas have evidence and experience to back them 
up. Organisations moving from good to great, however are learning to trust ideas from the 
creative imagination as well.39
Lucas comments that:
Organisations are toying with improvisation to help managers work together better in teams, 
release creativity and improve their presentation skills. However the key to gaining accept-
ance is getting past people’s scepticism about its value in the workplace. Rigid structures are 
all very well but they can and do inhibit free thinking, which is vital for creativity, improving 
business performance and engaging with your audience.40
Blocks to creativity
Managers often lack confidence in their ability to be creative and organisations may set up a 
number of blocks. It is therefore understandable that creativity is suppressed and devalued.
Goodman suggests six common blocks to personal creativity:
● Perceptual – habitual responses, stereotyping and reliance on past instructions and experiences.
● Emotional – fear, anxiety about looking foolish in front of others or making errors.

170
part 2 tHe individUaL
 ●  Process – lack of technique or skills in process; a quick grasp at a solution. 
 ●  Communication – style, method or skills unsuitable for dealing with problems. 
 ●  Environmental – facilities, stress factors, mindsets of others that inhibit responses. 
 ●  Cultural – culture and attitudes not facilitative; too risky and open-ended. 41 
 A distinction can be made in Goodman’s list between the fi rst four features, which are aspects 
of the individual’s psyche and repertoire of skills, and the last two, which are functions of the 
culture of the organisation. Unless there is a culture of creativity and interest in reconstruc-
tion, it is more likely that individuals will use their creativity and resourcefulness outside the 
organisation or against the organisation rather than for the organisation. 
 Despite the doubts and blocks, learning to be creative is encouraged by many writers 
through exercises and activities to stretch and develop imagination in wild and novel ways – 
often referred to as ‘thinking outside the box’.  These include procedures such as lateral think-
ing and brainstorming, discussed in  Chapter  8 . 
 Creativity and context 
 Rickards et al.  see creativity as a complex and compelling area of study that is as diffi  cult to 
defi ne as it is to achieve. In a thought-provoking series of contemporary articles, they explore 
how creativity can be better understood and used in a range of contexts, including innovation 
and entrepreneurship, environmental infl uences, knowledge management, personal creativity 
and structured interventions. Rickards  et al. refer to creativity occurring within particular con-
texts, two of the most important being cultural and organisational. These do not act merely as 
infl uences and determinants, however, but instead are also infl uenced by creativity: ‘It is simplis-
tic to think that contexts are always the infl uence and creative thinking the result. Instead, inter-
play implies that environments act on and are infl uenced by creative people and their eff orts.’ 42  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 traditional methods of student assessment are too rigid and restrictive in responses expected from students. the 
underlying search for standard answers effectively stifles or even penalises originality and creativity. 
 What are YOUR views? To what extent do you believe YOUR creativity is stifled? 
 Mentoring and coaching 
 Organisations need to off er learning and development opportunities that simultaneously 
challenge and support, together with eff ective procedures that enable people to harness their 
potential. This requires creativity to engage and motivate people emotionally to operate at 
their limits. So, how are employees to learn and acquire the skills that are necessary to further 
their career progression and/or to be eff ective managers? An integral part of this process is the 
role of mentoring and coaching. 
 Both mentoring and coaching are concerned with helping individuals to take responsibility 
for their learning and development. Although there is confusion about the two terms, which 
are often used interchangeably, practitioners usually perceive a clear diff erence. 
 Mentoring  aims to facilitate each individual’s capability and potential, to enhance their 
performance and to achieve their ambitions and career progression. Mentors are there to off er 
advice, guidance, support and feedback. Mentoring tends to focus on long-term development 
and the mentor is typically not the line manager but an expert in an area or a leader within 
the organisation. Rapport and confi dentiality are essential for either relationship to work

effectively. Mentoring can also serve as a means of socialisation and encouraging a sense of 
membership.
Coaching is a supportive relationship aimed at developing the individual’s self-awareness. 
Coaching is usually a line-management function with focus on knowledge and skills relating 
to specific tasks or activities that can be monitored and measured. There is an emphasis on 
performance. However, a coach does not ‘fix’ someone or solve their problems or assume an 
‘expert’s’ position; rather they try to draw out the wisdom from within.
Managers have always been informal mentors and coaches – some relishing this role with 
the required portfolio of skills, some being more hesitant and others having a negative influ-
ence and acting as a ‘block’ rather than a steer to their subordinates. One of the joys of man-
aging others is to know that you have helped others develop and grow. Mentoring is widely 
regarded today as a two-way process with benefit to both parties. Mentors often comment on 
the pleasure of being in touch with other people, what they themselves have learned and the 
opportunity to reflect on their own abilities and leadership style. (Management development 
is discussed in Chapter 16.)
Benefits of mentoring and coaching
The potential benefits of an organisation developing a mentoring and coaching culture seem 
to be well recognised.
According to Whitaker, mentoring is becoming increasingly popular as a powerful personal 
development and empowerment tool and as an effective way of helping people to progress in 
their careers. Mentoring traditionally described a relationship in which a more experienced 
work colleague used greater knowledge and understanding to support the development of a 
more junior or inexperienced member of staff.
Nowadays, however, a mentor is more than that. A mentor can help the mentee find the 
right direction and develop solutions to career issues. Mentors will usually rely on having 
had similar experiences to gain an empathy with the mentee and an understanding of their 
issues . . . Mentoring is to support and encourage people to manage their own learning in 
order that they may maximise their potential, develop their skills, improve their performance 
and become the person they want to be.43
Garrett suggests that mentoring is evolving from a casual arrangement to a vital tool for creat-
ing the next generation of leaders.
Mentoring has become so well established that it is virtually a way of life within many busi-
nesses, one of the key ways in which the baton is passed from one generation to the next. And its 
potency is acknowledged in the increasing use of mentoring to promote diversity within organi-
sations; it can help to furnish a route map to the top that might not previously have existed.44
ACAS refers to the success of coaching, shadowing and mentoring systems in developing con-
flict management capacity among line and operational managers.45
Coaching is used to help a person move forward. It is about change and focuses on results. 
It is therefore no surprise that many organisations are turning to coaching.
Despite some criticisms about the unethical process, the potential benefits of an organisa-
tion developing a coaching culture seem to be well recognised. According to Hodgson, for 
example:
One of the unique benefits that coaching offers is a ‘safe place’ where individuals can openly 
discuss the challenges they face and put in place a firm development plan to help them over-
come any obstacles. This can help them accelerate their own personal performance as well 
as that of their business.46
See the use of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) as part of coaching in Chapter 6.
A summary of formal mentoring is set out in the concept map of Figure 5.5.

Unilever’s global mentoring programme started in 2009 to fulfil the specific business objective of accelerating more 
women into senior leadership positions. ‘Before, mentoring was quite informal,’ says global talent manager Katherine 
Ray. ‘This was designed to speed up the transition between certain high-level roles.’
Patricia Corsi, Unilever’s brand development director for laundry products in Europe, joined the programme two 
years ago, and when her first mentor left the company she was paired with Pier Luigi Sigismondi, Unilever’s chief 
supply chain officer and a member of the worldwide executive board.
Corsi, who came to the UK from Brazil four years ago, says: ‘I wanted to have an opportunity to learn from a much 
more experienced professional and to get a different point of view on my career next steps.’ She was also eager to 
learn from someone who had made a similar geographic move – Sigismondi is originally from Italy and has worked 
in Venezuela – and had some specific management issues to discuss. She explains: ‘Sometimes you have a situation 
where you have to influence stakeholders. I wanted to find out how to convey one message, how do I make this 
message really strong and convincing?’
Sigismondi says the first meeting was not about formal objectives, however, but about getting to know each other. 
‘It’s important that you treat your mentee as a person, not as an employee,’ he says. ‘So we started talking about our-
selves, and this was the biggest surprise for her, because she was never expecting me to be myself and to actually tell 
her about what my challenges are where I sit,’
The pair have met every couple of months during the year for two hours at a time, and Corsi makes a point of 
preparing carefully for each meeting. She says: It’s important he feels I am committed to this programme and I really 
value his time, which I know is precious.’
For his part, Sigismondi says it is essential in any mentoring relationship to have ‘rules of engagement’: there 
must be a mutual interest, a clear commitment to invest the time, and respect. But he also believes that to be most 
effective, mentoring crosses the boundary of the merely professional, and explores deeper personal questions. ‘That 
unleashes many of the self-confidence issues that you need to face in order to grow professionally.’
His approach, he says, is to come to each meeting with a fresh perspective that Corsi will not have considered: ‘It keeps 
her thinking after the meeting on how to improve, how to see things differently and how to grow as a person.’ And Corsi 
says: ‘The value is immense, not just because he’s on the Unilever board, but because Pier Luigi is a very inspiring person.’
She concludes: ‘Knowing people believe in you drives you to do more and better. I’m very reassured about my 
role in Unilever, how the company sees me, and I have clarity on where I’m going. I really, really treasure this relation-
ship with my mentor.’

Applications of learning theory  
to organisations
Some of the major areas where it is possible to apply theories of learning include the following:
Self-development
● Learning what to ‘do’ (e.g. skills and knowledge).
● Learning how to ‘be’ (role behaviour).
● Learning the ropes (socialisation process and culture) and the social rules (norms and attitudes).
Development of others
● Personal development – training others and developing their potential (including skills of 
mentoring and coaching).
● Development of planned learning events.
Development of learning culture
● Policy development – developing policies for ‘learning organisations’; coping with changes 
and development; enabling ‘loose’, creative and lateral thinking.

  1  explain fully what you understand by the nature and signifi cance of learning and personal development. 
  2  explain fully the extent to which you can identify with the individual benefi ts of learning set out in a ‘declaration 
of learning’ in  table  5.1 . 
  3  give your own detailed interpretation of the learning process, including how  you best learn. 
  4  evaluate critically the relevance today of the behaviourist theories of learning. 
 Review and discussion questions 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 despite claims about benefits to the individual from coaching, in reality too much attention is given to improving 
organisational performance. there should be a stronger focus on personal development, learning life skills and the 
ability to adapt to change. 
 To what extent can YOU argue against this assertion? What is YOUR experience of coaching or what would YOU 
expect to gain from coaching? 
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  an understanding of ways in which people learn and develop is a dynamic concept and 
 fundamental feature of organisational behaviour and management. 
  2   Learning takes place in a variety of ways and a range of situations. Lifelong learning is essential 
to cope with the changing nature of work organisations. 
  3  the behaviourist approach to learning was interested only in the study of behaviour and those 
actions that could be observed, measured and controlled. 
  4   major studies include classical conditioning, the Law of eff ect and operant conditioning. Social 
learning theory draws attention to the infl uence of social interactions and imitation. 
  5   the cognitive approach gives attention to ways in which people learn. two major models 
include the Kolb learning cycle and the Honey and mumford styles of learning. 
  6   it is diffi  cult to separate how learning occurs without taking account of the employee and 
manager relationship and the general organisational climate. 
  7   Learning via technology (e-learning) is central to many organisations. it arises in a number of 
forms and can be used in a variety of diff erent contexts. 
  8  an increasingly important aspect of eff ective organisational performance is the idea of 
 knowledge management, which is linked to organisational learning. 
  9  in order to maintain competitive advantage the importance of a creative organisational culture 
has received increasing attention in recent years. 
  10  mentoring and coaching may contribute to an organisational climate in which individuals take 
responsibility for their own learning and development.

  8  To what extent could you argue that, despite apparent popularity, the lack of direct face-to-face interaction 
severely limits the value of e-learning? 
  9  Discuss the contention that most university courses expect standard responses from students with insuﬃ  cient 
allowance for originality or creative thinking. 
  10  Why is mentoring and coaching becoming a more common form of learning and development in organisa-
tions? Discuss critically the likely implications. 
 Assignment 
 A study by US psychologists suggested that you remember and recall more from writing notes by longhand 
rather than into a laptop or tablet computer. 
 Arrange for members of your seminar group to watch a video recording of a lecture they have not seen 
previously. 
 Ensure half the group have only pen and paper and half a laptop or tablet to make notes during the recording 
or immediately after. 
 Thirty minutes later, chair a meeting with the group where you ask a series of recall and comprehension ques-
tions based on the recording. 
 ● 
 What conclusions do you draw and to what extent do they support the original study? 
 ● 
 What, if any, are the implications for the process of learning and development? 
 ● 
 Be prepared to report back in plenary session. 
 Objectives 
 Completing this exercise should enable you to enhance the following skills: 
 ●  Participate meaningfully in a role play activity. 
 ●  Demonstrate the skills required in coaching and mentoring. 
 ●  Show sensitivity in your personal relationships with other people. 
 Exercise 
 Role play: manager/supervisor 
 You are a manager in the accounts department. Graeme, one of your most energetic people, has asked for some of 
your time and is coming to see you in a couple of minutes. You are not sure what it is about but you would like to 
take the opportunity to talk to him about the amount of work he takes on. He takes on anything that needs doing 
and is always the ﬁ rst to volunteer for new projects. This has been particularly so over the past few months and you 
are beginning to be concerned about his health. He looks pretty drained at the moment.

 Role play: employee/Graeme 
 You have been in the accounts department for six years now and really love your job. in fact, since you and your 
long-term partner split up a few months ago you have really thrown yourself into your work. it is nothing for you 
to work late into the evening and quite often at weekends. there are so many exciting things to get involved with 
that there is not enough time to do as much as you would like. Besides, your social life is not exactly buzzing at the 
moment and you have never got hooked into any particular hobbies or pastimes. Your manager has always been full 
of praise for your performance, consistently giving you a high rating on your objectives. You have also made rapid 
progress during your time in the department. 
 You have felt a bit drained recently and fi nd it hard to switch off . You have asked to see your manager about an 
exciting new piece of work you have heard about. You would really like to get involved in it. You do not want to give 
up your other stuff , though. 
 Discussion 
 ●  What do you believe is the best training method for developing coaching and mentoring skills? 
 ●  How would you attempt to ensure the transparency necessary for good coaching while maintaining confi dential-
ity about personal circumstances? 
 ●  debate critically what you have learned from undertaking this activity. 
 in 2008 the charity voluntary Service overseas (vSo) 
celebrated its fi ftieth birthday with an event in the royal 
Festival Hall involving some of the 30,000 vSo volun-
teers past and present. Unlike charities that work by 
sending money abroad to support projects or provide 
direct fi nancial aid, vSo sends people, their energy and 
their expertise to partner organisations in the develop-
ing world. it is a signifi cant aspect of the UK’s work for 
overseas development, and in 2013–14 the UK govern-
ment provided almost £50 million (approximately 75 
per cent) of vSo’s income. 47 vSo has come a long way 
since the fi rst dozen young people took ‘a year between’ 
school and university during 1958–9 to head for nige-
ria, ghana and Sarawak with the aim of off ering: 
   service that would not only make a positive contribution 
to those countries but would constitute an experience 
of inestimable benefit to many of our young people. 48 
 not only has it grown (by 2014 it had placed over 40,000 
volunteers in developing countries around the world) 49 
but its structure and emphasis have changed in line with 
globalisation, economic development and new chal-
lenges. one thing that has not changed, however, is the 
importance of and value placed on learning and knowl-
edge sharing, which is at the centre of vSo’s mission.

 The gap year 
 the phrase ‘year between’ was coined by a sub-editor 
of the  Sunday Times on 23 march 1958. it was used in 
the headline given to a letter from the Bishop of ports-
mouth that had been written in collaboration with alec and 
moira dickson, the three founders of what became vSo.

 VSO 

Chapter 5  Learning and development

In it they suggested that some of the school leavers 
who found themselves having to wait before university 
places became available (the ending of national service 
had created a bottleneck) could both offer something 
and benefit from a spell collaborating in projects for 
education, youth work and community development in 
poorer areas of the world. Dickson had worked in Nige-
ria and Iraq for the government and for UNESCO, and 
he and his wife had also spent time in Sarawak, so he 
understood the opportunities first hand. What inspired 
him was the idea that young people without specialist 
training, expertise or technical skills could offer help 
on a more equal footing than in the usual types of aid 
project, which Western experts managed and ran. The 
idea took root; just over a dozen 18–19 year olds signed 
up to the adventure, and the idea of the ‘gap year’ had 
been born.
Yesterday, today, tomorrow
VSO today is different in many respects from its 1958 
self. In its foundation year the average age of the UK-
recruited volunteers was 18; they expected to be placed 
for a year and were mainly involved in teaching (usually 
English) and healthcare. This remained broadly charac-
teristic of the volunteer group for the first ten years of 
operation, but by 2008 things had changed. The 1,500 
plus active volunteers had an average age of 41; they 
were recruited in Asia and Africa as well as in the UK and 
the average stay was two years.
In the early years of the new millennium, VSO 
revised its strategy and approach to reflect the changing 
needs of the developing world. Many developing coun-
tries now have their own source of school leavers and 
graduates so the focus is now on sharing skills for future 
professionals rather than providing immediate, direct 
services. In 2006 it announced that it would be attempt-
ing to recruit experienced head teachers and education 
managers rather than newly qualified teachers in order 
to focus on helping governments and training colleges 
to improve schools in developing countries; a number 
have since travelled to Rwanda, Namibia and Ghana to 
do just this.50 At the same time it launched an appeal 
to recruit senior-level managers who could work with 
government departments and private businesses, even 
if only for a short period of a few weeks, to help with 
such things as developing IT, tourism, financial and HR 
management systems.51 However, it has not abandoned 
its traditional base, and is working with the government 
and other volunteering organisations to support an ini-
tiative that provides opportunities for 18–25 year olds 
with limited expertise – the International Citizen Ser-
vice (ICS).52
While education workers still comprise the largest 
professional group among VSO volunteers, there is a 
growing emphasis on activities to ensure a secure and 
sustainable livelihood for poor people, focusing on agri-
culture, food and natural resource management. One of 
the next most important areas of activity for the charity 
is HIV and AIDS-related work, with volunteers training 
23,800 local health, HIV and AIDS practitioners in Africa, 
Asia and Mongolia during 2013–14.53
Learning from experience
From the outset, VSO saw that learning had to be recipro-
cal between volunteers and host organisations. The his-
tory of the movement offers a wealth of anecdotes and 
stories which suggest that the learning is very much a 
two-way process.54 While volunteers can be, and are, pre-
pared for many aspects of their experience through brief-
ings and training activities prior to leaving the UK, some 
things just have to be learned the hard way. Culture shock 
was recognised as a major risk from the outset – especially 
since VSO has always maintained that a volunteer goes:
not as a crusader, still less as a social revolutionary, 
and least of all as a representative or advocate of some 
British or Western ‘way of life’, but as an assistant, 
to work within an established framework and for 
objectives already formulated by the local authority 
which the volunteer undertakes to serve.55
Learning to fit in, therefore, is crucial, and misunder-
standings or ignorance about significant cultural norms 
can create unforeseen risks.56 Later there are ‘re-entry’ 
problems; many volunteer diaries tell of reluctance to 
leave their host communities and the anticipated diffi-
culty of fitting back into a more structured life at home 
with far less autonomy and responsibility than they 
experienced during their placement.
In the early years, culture shock was often exac-
erbated by isolation, since most placements were in 
remote and inaccessible areas where communication 
was difficult and infrequent. While satellite technology 
may have helped resolve some of these difficulties, the 
lack of reliable infrastructure (electricity in particular) 
still means that volunteers can feel very ‘alone’. How-
ever, communication is at the heart of learning, which 
remains the core of VSO’s mission.
Writing in 2004, two information and learning pro-
fessionals with VSO described the importance of a 
professional approach to learning and knowledge trans-
fer.57 They outline the creation of a ‘knowledge map’ of 
the organisation’s often fragmented and locally stored 
expertise which can be the basis of a catalogue for vol-
unteers to search as and when they need it. The concept

has been integrated into the training and support sys-
tem for volunteers via the VSO ‘Learning Hub’, a web-
based intranet resource which contains information, 
briefing materials and language training, and which 
connects both current and past volunteers through 
online discussion forums. Volunteers have password-
protected access to the site, which is introduced during 
the six-stage induction and initial training programme.58 
The Learning Hub additionally contains a dedicated sec-
tion for returners, enabling volunteers to prepare for the 
transition when coming home, but also capturing their 
knowledge and experience for future volunteers.
Sharing skills, changing lives
Of course, the volunteers themselves should learn as 
much as their hosts, and return to the UK with new-
found or honed skills. As Mark Goldring, former VSO 
Chief Executive, remarked in a press interview:
Returned volunteers are better at improvisation and 
problem solving. They have better interpersonal, cross-
cultural and management skills.59
The recession too had an impact on VSO, with the 
organisation experiencing double the usual number 
of enquiries in the last three months of 2008.60 Clearly 
there is value in being able to add a spell of voluntary 
work to a CV in a tough jobs market, and we should 
remember that poorer countries have suffered from 
the recession too, perhaps more acutely than wealth-
ier ones, so volunteers still have much to offer. A final 
thought about the role of volunteering in the modern 
world comes from a piece by an Australian volunteer 
turned development academic.
At its worst, international volunteering can be 
imperialist, paternalistic charity, volunteer tourism or a 
self-serving quest for career and personal development 
on the part of well-off Westerners . . . At its best, I 
argue, international volunteering brings benefits (and 
costs) to individual volunteers and the organisation 
with which they work, at the same time as providing 
the space for an exchange of technical skills, 
knowledge and cross-cultural experience in developing 
communities.61
 Tasks
	 1	 Research VSO’s six-stage pre-placement briefing programme for new volunteers available on the VSO 
website http://www.vso.org.uk/volunteer/supporting-you/training-and-orientation. What types of 
learning do you think are involved? Who do you think should be involved in its delivery, and why?
	 2	 How could an understanding of learning styles improve the effectiveness of the volunteer training 
programme? Explain the practical implications this would have for the way the programme is run.
	 3	 How effective do you think a knowledge management system like the VSO Learning Hub can be in 
capturing and transferring both explicit and tacit types of knowledge? Is it more suited to one than the 
other?
	 4	 What employability skills do you think might be developed in young people who have limited work 
experience by the International Citizen Service scheme? How can VSO and other organisations ensure 
these skills are transferred back to the volunteers’ home environments afterwards?

  CHAPTER 6 
 Perception and communication 
 The process of perception is at the root of our understanding, behaviour 
and actions. Knowledge and awareness of the perceptual process can 
help develop insights about ourselves and interactions with others. 
The words we use and speak, the way we look and the body language 
we display communicate our view of the world. Managers need to 
understand the importance of perception and communications in 
guiding behaviour and for eff ective personal and work relationships with 
others. 
 Learning outcomes 
 After completing this chapter you should have enhanced your ability to: 
 ●  explain the nature and importance of the perceptual process; 
 ●  detail internal and external factors that provide meaning to the individual; 
 ●  explain the importance of perceptual illusions, and impression management; 
 ●  identify diffi  culties in perceiving other people, including non-verbal 
communications; 
 ●  explain the importance of language and communications in perception; 
 ●  evaluate the relevance of neuro-linguistic programming and transactional analysis; 
 ●  assess the nature and signifi cance of perceptual distortions and errors. 
 People differ as individuals. Even confronted with exactly the same situation this will give rise to a variety of responses, 
behaviours and actions. There is no way managers can cope with such a range of individual perspectives so the study 
of perception is largely a waste of time. 
 What are YOUR views? What do YOU expect to gain from a study of perception?

Part 2  The individual	
The importance of understanding perception
The significance of individual differences is particularly apparent when focusing on the pro-
cess of perception. Although general theories of perception were first proposed during the 
last century, the importance of understanding the perceptual process is arguably even more 
significant today. We all have our own, unique picture or image of how we see the ‘reality’ of 
the world around us, and our own way of looking at and understanding our environment and 
the people within it. This is a complex and dynamic process.
We do not passively receive information, we analyse and judge it, and place significance on 
certain information and disregard other information as worthless. We may also be influenced 
by our expectations so that we perceive what we expect to ‘see’ or ‘hear’. A situation may be 
the same, but the interpretation of that situation by two individuals may be vastly different. 
Perception is at the root of organisational behaviour; any situation can be analysed in terms of 
its perceptual connotations. Consider, for instance, the following situation.
A member of senior management has sent an email to departmental managers asking them to provide statistics of 
overtime worked within their section during the past six months and projections for the next six months. Mixed reac-
tions could result:
● One manager may see it as a reasonable and welcome request to provide information in the hopeful expectation 
that this will help lead to improved staffing levels.
● Another manager may be extremely upset and suspect the information will be used by senior management to 
order cutbacks in future overtime in order to reduce staffing costs.
● A third manager may see it as an unreasonable demand, intended only to enable management to exercise closer 
supervision and control over the activities of the section.
● A fourth manager may have no objection to providing the information but be suspicious that it may lead to pos-
sible intrusion into the running of the section.
● Yet another manager may see it as a positive action by management to investigate ways of improving efficiency 
throughout the organisation.
Each of the departmental managers has their own different perception of the email, which could be influenced, for 
example, by their working relationship with senior management or previous experiences. Their perceived reality and 
understanding of the situation provokes individual reactions. In addition, there are likely to be mixed reactions to the 
use of email as the means of communication in this instance.
The perceptual process
It is not possible to have an understanding of perception without taking into account its sen-
sory basis. We are not able to attend to everything in our environment; our sensory systems 
have limits. The physical limits therefore insist that we are selective in our attention and per-
ception. Early pioneer work by psychologists has resulted in an understanding of universal 
laws that underlie the perceptual process. It seems that we cannot help but search for meaning 
and understanding in our environment. The way in which we categorise and organise this sen-
sory information is based on a range of factors including the present situation, our emotional 
state and any experiences of the same or a similar event.
Selectivity in attention and perception
Some information may be considered highly important to us and may result in immediate 
response. In other instances, the information may be simply ‘parked’ or assimilated in other 
ideas and thoughts. Some of our ‘parked’ material may be forgotten or, indeed, changed and 
reconstructed over time.1 We should be aware of the assumptions that are made throughout 

Chapter 6  Perception and communication
183
the perceptual process, below our conscious threshold. We have learned to take for granted 
certain constants in our environment. We assume that features of our world will stay the same 
and thus we do not need to spend our time and energy seeing things afresh and anew. We make 
a number of inferences throughout the entire perceptual process. Although these inferences 
may save time and speed up the process, they may also lead to distortions and inaccuracies.
Perception as information processing
It is common to see the stages of perception described as an information-processing system (see 
Figure 6.1): (top-down) information (stimuli) (Box A) is selected at one end of the process (Box 
B), then interpreted (Box C) and translated (Box D), resulting in action or thought patterns 
(Box E). However, it is important to note that such a model simplifies the process and although 
it makes it easy to understand, it does not do justice to the complexity and dynamics of the 
process. In certain circumstances, we may select information out of the environment because 
of the way we categorise the world. The dashed line illustrates this ‘bottom-up’ process.
For instance, if a manager has been advised by colleagues that a particular trainee has 
managerial potential, the manager may be specifically looking for confirmation that those 
views are correct. This process has been known as ‘top-down’ because the cognitive processes 
are influencing the perceptual readiness of the individual to select certain information. This 
emphasises the active nature of the perceptual process. We do not passively digest the informa-
tion from our senses, but actively attend to and indeed, at times, seek out certain information. 
(See also the discussion on self-fulfilling prophecy below.)
Meaning to the individual
The process of perception explains the manner in which information (stimuli) from the envi-
ronment around us is selected and organised to provide meaning for the individual. Perception 
is the mental function of giving significance to stimuli such as shapes, colours, movement, 
taste, sounds, touch, smells, pain, pressures and feelings. Perception gives rise to individual 
behavioural responses to particular situations.
Despite the fact that a group of people may ‘physically see’ the same thing, they each have 
their own version of what is seen – their perceived view of reality. Consider, for example, 
the image (published by W. E. Hill in Puck, 6 November 1915) shown in Figure 6.2. What do 
Figure 6.1  Perceptions as information processing

184
part 2 THE IndIVIduAL 
you see? Do you see a young, attractive, well-dressed woman? Or do you see an older, poor 
woman? Or can you now see both?  And who can say with certainty that there is just the one, 
‘correct’ answer? 
 Why do we attend to certain stimuli and not to others? There are two important factors 
to consider in this discussion. The process of perceptual selection is based both on internal 
characteristics relating to the state of the individual and on the environment and infl uences 
external to the individual.  
 Figure 6.2  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 In order to develop our perceptual abilities the first step is recognition and understanding of the process that we 
determine of our selection and attention of the stimuli around us. 
 To what extent do YOU identify with this statement? What stimulus factors most catch YOUR attention and 
selection? 
 Internal factors 
 Our sensory systems have limits. For instance, our eyes receive and convert light waves into 
electrical signals that are transmitted to the visual cortex of the brain and translated into 
meaning. Our sensory system is geared to respond to changes in the environment. This has 
particular implications for the way in which we perceive the world and it explains why we 

Chapter 6  Perception and communication
185
are able to ignore the humming of the central heating system but notice instantly a telephone 
ringing. The term used to describe the way in which we disregard the familiar is ‘habituation’.
Sensory limits or thresholds
As individuals we may differ in terms of our sensory limits or thresholds. People differ not 
only in their absolute thresholds, but also in their ability to discriminate between stimuli. For 
instance, it may not be possible for the untrained to distinguish between different types of wine 
but this would be an everyday event for the trained sommelier. We are able to learn to discrimi-
nate and are able to train our senses to recognise small differences between stimuli. It is also 
possible for us to adapt to unnatural environments and learn to cope.2 We may also differ in 
terms of the amount of sensory information we need to reach our own comfortable equilib-
rium. Some individuals would find loud music at a party or gig uncomfortable and unpleasant, 
whereas for others the intensity of the music is part of the total enjoyment. Likewise, if we are 
deprived of sensory information for too long this can lead to feelings of discomfort and fatigue.
Psychological factors
Psychological factors will also affect what is perceived. These internal factors, such as person-
ality, learning and motives, will give rise to an inclination to perceive certain stimuli with a 
readiness to respond in certain ways. This has been called an individual’s perceptual set (see 
Figure 6.3).
Differences in the ways individuals acquire information have been used as one of four scales 
in the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (discussed in Chapter 4). They distinguish individuals 
who ‘tend to accept and work with what is given in the here-and-now, and thus become realis-
tic and practical’ (sensing types), from others who go beyond the information from the senses 
and look at the possible patterns, meanings and relationships. These ‘intuitive types’ ‘grow 
expert at seeing new possibilities and new ways of doing things’. Myers and Briggs stress the 
value of both types and emphasise the importance of complementary skills and variety in any 
successful enterprise or relationship.3
Needs of the individual
The needs of each individual will affect their perceptions. For example, a manager deeply 
engrossed in preparing an urgent report may screen out ringing telephones, the sound of com-
puters, people talking and furniture being moved in the next office, but will respond readily to 
the smell of coffee brewing. The most desirable and urgent needs will almost certainly affect 
Figure 6.3  Factors affecting an individual’s perceptual set

186
Part 2  The individual	
an individual’s perceptual process. Members of a church choir might well form a perception of 
the minister quite different from that of a parishioner seeking comfort after the recent death 
of a close relative.
The ‘Pollyanna Principle’ claims that pleasant stimuli will be processed more quickly and 
remembered more precisely than unpleasant stimuli. However, it must be noted that intense 
internal drives may lead to perceptual distortions of situations (or people) and unwillingness to 
absorb certain painful information. (Perceptual distortions are considered later in the chapter.)
Learning from experiences has a critical effect throughout all stages of the perceptual pro-
cess. It will affect the stimuli perceived in the first instance, and then the ways in which those 
stimuli are understood and processed, and finally the response that is given. For example, it is 
likely that a maintenance engineer visiting a school for the first time will notice different things 
about it than will a teacher attending an interview or a child arriving on the first day. The 
learning gained from experiences colours what is seen and processed.
Cultural differences
The ways in which people interact are also subject to cultural differences and such differences 
may be misconstrued. There are many ways of describing culture, but the following definition 
from Schein helps relate culture to diversity and perception.
A pattern of basic assumptions – invented, discovered or developed by a given group as it 
learns to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration – that has 
worked well enough to be considered valuable and therefore to be taught to new members as 
the correct way to perceive, think and feel in relation to these problems.4
Embarrassment and discomfort can occur when emotional lines are broken. This was demon-
strated in an American study that researched the experience of Japanese students visiting the 
USA for the first time. The researchers felt that the Japanese students faced considerable chal-
lenges in adapting to the new culture. Some of the surprises that the students reported related 
to social interaction:
Casual visits and frequent phone calls at midnight to the host room-mate were a new expe-
rience to them. The sight of opposite-sex partners holding hands or kissing in public places 
also surprised them . . . That males do cooking and shopping in the household or by them-
selves, that fathers would play with children, and that there was frequent intimacy displayed 
between couples were all never-heard-of in their own experiences at home.5
In certain cultures, such as the USA, it is ‘normal’ to explain all details clearly, explicitly and 
directly. In other cultures the ‘spelling out’ of all the details is unnecessary and embarrassing.
McCrum refers to a joke circulated on the Web by disaffected UN staff. A worldwide survey 
was conducted by the UN. The only question asked was: ‘Would you please give your honest 
opinion about solutions to the food shortage in the rest of the world?’ The survey was a failure. 
In Africa they didn’t know what ‘food’ meant; in India they didn’t know what ‘honest’ meant; 
in Europe they didn’t know what ‘shortage’ meant; in China they didn’t know what ‘opinion’ 
meant; in the Middle East they didn’t know what ‘solution’ meant; in South America they didn’t 
know what ‘please’ meant; and in the USA they didn’t know what ‘the rest of the world’ meant.6
Ways in which words are used and the assumptions made about shared understanding are 
dependent upon an individual’s culture and upbringing. Cultural differences often lead to ste-
reotypical views. For example, Stewart-Allen discusses a common mindset about Americans:
American business people seem to suffer from a long-standing image problem abroad. The 
stereotypical view is that they are loud and impatient with a ‘bigger is better’ attitude; they 
lecture others about how to do business the American way and are insular in outlook.
However, a more accurate assumption is that Americans lack international exposure.7 (Stereo-
typing is discussed below.)

 Diversity Resource Handbook 
 Portsmouth Hospitals nHS Trust has produced a comprehensive ‘diversity resource Handbook’ intended to provide 
members of staff  with practical advice and guidelines on delivering a sensitive service to the diverse community it 
serves. Good communication is fundamental to providing a good quality service. If the correct meaning is not con-
veyed via eff ective communication, we risk inducing feelings of confusion, frustration, isolation and perhaps anger. It 
is important not only to be aware of the appropriate naming systems, but to use them eff ectively. 
 using the right terminology is extremely important, particularly when referring to disability, because the words 
you use refl ect your attitudes and beliefs. The key towards working towards acceptable language is fi rstly to see the 
person and not their disability, or background, and choose language that aims to include and value people with a 
disability. The booklet sets out advice and guidelines on age, disability, race, religious and cultural issues, major world 
religions, interpreting and translating, sexual orientation and gender, and aids to communication. 
 The booklet draws attention to the importance and realities of perceptual awareness, including: 
 Awareness in a multicultural society – some guidelines 
 Be aware that in some communities it may not be the custom to shake hands, especially amongst women. 
 Be sensitive to the diffi  culties that may be caused for ethnic minorities by using jargon and slang. 
 Be sensitive to using colloquialisms or terms of endearment that may cause off ence, e.g. love, dear or darling. 
 Be aware that in some communities a woman may feel uncomfortable or may not wish to be in a room with a 
man who is not a relative. 
 Be aware that an act of comfort, such as putting an arm around a person, may cause embarrassment or off ence. 
 Appreciate cultural diff erences in body language – for example, looking away instead of maintaining eye contact 
is not necessarily a sign of dishonesty or disrespect, in some communities it may be the opposite. 
 Ask for the individual’s personal and family name. don’t ask someone what his or her christian name or sur-
name is.  
 Just because someone responds to questions in English they may not fully understand what is being said. 
 don’t underestimate the infl uence of your own cultural background on your unconscious perceptions and 
behaviours.

 Tasks 
  1.  What do you think of the idea of an nHS diversity resource Handbook? Would you recommend a similar hand-
book for your own university or organisation? 
  2.  Give your own examples of the importance and realities of perceptual awareness. 
  3.  discuss how you would attempt to improve awareness of perception and communication in a multicultural 
society. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 The overriding obstacles to effective perception and communication are lack of understanding cultural differences 
and inappropriate use of language. 
 From YOUR own experience to what extent do YOU agree with this contention? How much are YOU aware of cul-
tural differences and YOUR own use of language? 

188
Part 2  The individual	
External factors
Knowledge, familiarity or expectations about a given situation or previous experiences will 
influence perception. External factors refer to the nature and characteristics of the stimuli. 
There is usually a tendency to give more attention to stimuli that are, for example:
● bright
● novel
● repeated
● in strong contrast to their background.
Any number of these factors may be present at a given time or in a given situation. The use of 
these stimuli is a key feature in the design of advertising. (Think of your own examples.) It is 
the total pattern of the stimuli together with the context in which they occur that influence 
perception. For example, it is usually a novel or unfamiliar stimulus that is more noticeable, 
but a person is more likely to perceive the familiar face of a friend among a group of people all 
dressed in the same-style uniform (see Figure 6.4).8
We are all familiar with the expression ‘what on earth is that doing here?’. The sight of a 
fork-lift truck on the factory floor in a manufacturing organisation is likely to be perceived 
quite differently from one in the corridor of a university. Consider another example: the sight 
of a jet ski (left temporarily by a neighbour moving house) in the garage of a person known

189
to be scared of water is likely to elicit such a remark. Yet the sight of numerous jet skis on the 
beach is likely to pass without comment. The word ‘terminal’ is likely to be perceived differ-
ently in the context of: (i) a hospital, (ii) an airport, or (iii) a computer firm. Consumer psy-
chologists and marketing experts apply these perceptual principles with extraordinary success 
for some of their products.
Organisation and arrangement of stimuli
The Gestalt School of Psychology led by Max Wertheimer claimed that the process of 
perception is innately organised and patterned. It described the process as one that has 
built-in field effects. In other words, the brain can act like a dynamic, physical field in which 
interaction among elements is an intrinsic part. The Gestalt School produced a series of 
principles, which are still readily applicable today. Some of the most significant include the 
following:
● figure and ground
● grouping
● closure.
Figure and ground
The figure and ground principle states that figures are seen against a background. The figure 
does not have to be an object; it could be merely a geometrical pattern. Figure and ground 
relationships are often reversible, as in the popular example shown in Figure 6.5. What do you 
see first? Do you see a white chalice (or small stand shape) in the centre of the frame? Or do 
you see the dark profiles of twins facing each other on the edge of the frame? Now look again. 
Can you see the other shape?
The figure and ground principle has applications in occupational situations. It is important 
that employees know and are able to attend to the significant aspects (the figure) and treat 
other elements of the job as context (background). Early training sessions aim to identify 
and focus on the significant aspects of a task. Managerial effectiveness can also be judged in 
terms of chosen priorities (the figure). Stress could certainly occur for those employees who 
are uncertain about their priorities and are unable to distinguish between the significant and 
less significant tasks. They feel overwhelmed by the ‘whole’ picture.
Figure 6.5

Part 2  The individual	
Grouping
The grouping principle refers to the tendency to organise shapes and patterns instantly into 
meaningful groupings or patterns on the basis of their proximity or similarity. Parts that are 
close in time or space tend to be perceived together. For example, in Figure 6.6a, the workers 
are more likely to be perceived as nine independent people, but in Figure 6.6b, because of the 
proximity principle, the workers may be perceived as three distinct groups of people. Consider 
the importance of the layout of the room and tables for a large wedding reception and the 
perception of people in terms of both the table where they are sat and with whom they are 
grouped!
Taxi firms often use the idea of grouping to display their telephone number. In the exam-
ple below, which of the following numbers – (a), (b) or (c) – is most likely to be remembered 
easily?
(a)  347 474    (b)  347474    (c)  34 74 74
Similar parts tend to be seen together as forming a familiar group.
In the following example there is a tendency to see alternate lines of characters – crosses 
and noughts (or circles). This is because the horizontal similarity is usually greater than the 
vertical similarity. However, if the page is turned sideways the figure may be perceived as alter-
nate noughts and crosses in each line.
×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×
○    ○    ○    ○    ○    ○    ○    ○
×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×
○    ○    ○    ○    ○    ○    ○    ○
It is also interesting to note that, when asked to describe this pattern, many people refer to 
alternate lines of noughts and crosses – rather than crosses and noughts.
There is also an example here of the impact of cultural differences, mentioned earlier. The 
author undertook a teaching exchange in the USA and gave this exercise to a class of Ameri-
can students. Almost without exception the students described the horizontal pattern cor-
rectly as alternate rows of crosses and noughts (or zeros). The explanation appears to be that 
Americans do not know the game as ‘noughts and crosses’ but refer to it as ‘tic-tac-toe’.
Closure
There is also a tendency to complete an incomplete figure – to fill in the gaps (mentally) and to 
perceive the figure as a whole. This creates an overall and meaningful image for the individual 
rather than an unconnected series of lines or blobs.
In the example in Figure 6.79 most people are likely to see the blobs as either the letter B or 
the number 13, possibly depending on whether at the time they had been more concerned with 
written material or dealing in numbers. However, for some people the figure may be described 
in terms of just a series of eleven discrete blobs, or perceived as some other (to them) meaning-
ful pattern/object. According to Gestalt theory, perceptual organisation is instant and spon-
taneous. We cannot stop ourselves making meaningful assumptions about our environment. 
Figure 6.6 

Chapter 6  Perception and communication
191
The Gestaltists emphasised the ways in which the elements interact and claimed that the new 
pattern or structure perceived had a character of its own, hence the famous phrase ‘the whole 
is more than the sum of its parts’.
Perceptual illusions
Here are some examples to help you judge your perceptive skills. In Figure 6.8 try reading aloud 
the four words. It is possible that you find yourself ‘caught’ in a perceptual set that means that 
you tend to pronounce ‘machinery’ as ‘MacHinery’, as if it too were a Scottish surname.
In Figure 6.9, which of the centre blue circles is the larger – A or B?

Although you may have guessed that the two centre circles are in fact the same size, the 
circle on the right (B) may well appear larger because it is framed by smaller circles. The centre 
circle on the left (A) may well appear smaller because it is framed by larger circles.
In Figure 6.10 try saying the colour of the word, not the word itself.
The physiological nature of perception has already been discussed briefly, but it is of rel-
evance here in the discussion of illusions. Why does the circle on the right in Figure 6.9 look 
bigger? Why is it difficult to say the colour, not the word? These examples demonstrate the 
way our brain can be fooled. Indeed, we make assumptions about our world that go beyond 
the pure sensations our brain receives.
Beyond reality
Perception goes beyond the sensory information and converts patterns to a three-dimensional 
reality that we understand. This conversion process, as we can see, is easily tricked. We may 
not be aware of the inferences we are making as they are part of our conditioning and learn-
ing. The Stroop experiment shown in Figure 6.10 illustrates this perfectly.10
An illustration of the way in which we react automatically to stimuli is the illusion of the 
impossible triangle (see Figure 6.11).
Even when we know the triangle is impossible we still cannot stop ourselves from complet-
ing the triangle and attempting to make it meaningful. We thus go beyond what is given and 
make assumptions about the world, which in certain instances are wildly incorrect. Psycholo-
gists and designers may make positive use of these assumptions to project positive images of a 
product or the environment. For instance: colours may be used to induce certain atmospheres 
in buildings; designs of wallpaper or texture of curtains may be used to create feelings of spa-
ciousness or cosiness; and packaging of products may tempt us to see something as bigger or 
perhaps more precious.

Impression management
In some situations we all attempt to project our attitudes, personality and competence by paying 
particular attention to our appearance and the impact this may have on others. This has been 
labelled ‘impression management’.11 The selection interview is an obvious illustration. Some infor-
mation is given more weight than other information when an impression is formed. It would seem 
that there are central traits that are more important than others in determining our perceptions.
What information do we select and why? The social situation consists of both verbal and 
non-verbal signals. Non-verbal signals include:
● bodily contact
● proximity
● orientation
● head movements
● facial expressions
● gestures
● posture
● direction of gaze
● dress and appearance
● non-verbal aspects of speech.
Verbal and non-verbal signals are co-ordinated into regular sequences, often without the 
awareness of the parties. The mirroring of actions has been researched and is called ‘postural 
echoing’.12 There is considerable evidence to indicate that each person is constantly influenc-
ing the other and being influenced.13
Lucas refers to the importance of the ‘personal brand’ that we all have.
You may not be aware of it and you probably haven’t consciously developed it, but it’s what 
drives how you are perceived at work and how successful you are in your daily dealings with col-
leagues and clients. Your personal brand is about the way you come across to others. It’s about 
the messages you send with the way you dress, the tone of your voice and your body language.14
Rigby points out that although it would be good to think all managers view staff as equal and 
judged only on results, there are still plenty of ways in which people discriminate. Eleven fac-
tors that can hold back your career are:
● dress sense
● appearance
● body modification
● accent
● education
● parentage
● height
● hair
● weight
● politics
● religion.15
Despite becoming somewhat clichéd, Everett reminds us of the truth of the expression that 
‘you never get a second chance to make a first impression’. It takes five to seven seconds to 
make a first impression.
To begin with, the person we are meeting will take in our non-verbal impact, beginning with 
our body language and then our dress and appearance. That will be followed by the quality or 
clarity of our voice, and thirdly what we say. This does not mean that image is more important 
than content – far from it, we need real substance too . . . Making a positive first impression 
sounds like common sense, but it is not common practice. Bring it into your conscious thoughts 
every day and manage that instant portrayal of your person brand more effectively.16

194
part 2 THE IndIVIduAL 
 Research by  Willis and Todorov  demonstrated that an exposure time of no more than a tenth of a 
second is suffi  cient to form an impression of a stranger from their facial appearance. Longer expo-
sure time increases confi dence in judgements but does not alter signifi cantly the fi rst impression. 17 
 Dress code and culture 
 The meanings we ascribe to these non-verbal signals are rooted in our culture and early sociali-
sation. Thus it is no surprise that there are signifi cant diff erences in the way we perceive such 
signals. For instance, dress codes diff er in degrees of formality.  Schneider and Barsoux sum-
marise some interesting cultural diff erences: 
 Northern European managers tend to dress more informally than their Latin counterparts. At 
conferences, it is not unlikely for the Scandinavian managers to be wearing casual clothing, while 
their French counterparts are reluctant to remove their ties and jackets. For the Latin managers, 
personal style is important, while Anglo and Asian managers do not want to stand out or attract 
attention in their dress. French women managers are more likely to be dressed in ways that Anglo 
women managers might think inappropriate for the offi  ce. The French, in turn, think it strange 
that American businesswomen dress in ‘man-like’ business suits (sometimes with running shoes). 18 
 Ziolo discusses how the collective set of each generation diff ers due to diff erent life experiences, 
work ethic and culture. Even if we have to make large generalisations, an understanding of sarto-
rial trends of each generation can lead to a better understanding of the culture that guides them. 
 Even if you are not a dedicated follower of fashion what you wear is defi ned not just by your 
individual tastes but also by the societal and cultural experiences of your era. With most senior 
managers and executives hailing from the old school, clothing is not an expression of self, but 
a business uniform identifying the divide between the professional self and the self at leisure – 
therefore, a suit is the norm. Younger employees are less likely to make this distinction, seeing 
work much more part of what defi nes them, where expression of personality matters. 19   
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Popular sports, film or television celebrities often appear to have a far greater impact on perception, communica-
tions and behaviour of people at work than any textbook, manager or training course. 
 Why do YOU think this is the case and is it necessarily a bad thing? To what extent does this apply to YOU? 
 Organisation and judgement 
 The way in which we organise and make judgements about what we have perceived is, to a large 
extent, based on experiences and learning. It is important to be aware of the inferences and assump-
tions we make that go beyond the information given. We may not always be aware of our pre-set 
assumptions but they will guide the way in which we interpret the behaviour of others. In the same 
way that we make assumptions, about the world of objects and go beyond the information provided, 
we also make critical inferences about people’s characteristics and possible likely behaviours. 
 A manager might well know more about person A, a member of staff  who has become or was 
already a good friend, who is seen in a variety of social situations and with whom there is a close 
relationship, than about person B, another member of staff  in the same section as A and under-
taking similar duties, but with whom there is only a formal work relationship and a limited social 
acquaintance. These diff erences in relationship, information and interaction might well infl uence 
the manager’s perception if asked, for example, to evaluate the work performance of A and B. 
 Judgement of other people can also be infl uenced by perceptions of such stimuli as: 
 ●  role or status 
 ●  occupation 

Chapter 6 PErcEPTIOn And cOMMunIcATIOn
195
 ●  ethnicity, gender and age 
 ●  physical factors and appearance 
 ●  non-verbal communication and body language  (discussed below). 
 Physical characteristics and appearance 
 There are frequent popular surveys and articles that refer to the suggestion that tall people, 
both men and women, are more likely to be successful both socially and professionally. For 
example,  Cohen  comments that taller people who look down on shorter colleagues are per-
ceived to have confi dence and respect. In an interesting account celebrating the lives of tall 
people, Cohen maintains that height is a pivotal piece of identity and the most defi ning force 
in our lives. Height determined her choice of sports (swimming), boyfriends (tall), social circle 
(tall), my college (tall), and my personality (big enough to fi ll the tall). 20 
 An example is the appointment (June 2009) of the Speaker of the House of Commons, 
John Bercow, who is 5 ft 6 in tall (1.68 m). This appointment prompted newspaper articles 
about ‘heightism’ and perceptions about the ‘shorter man’. 21 
 In the work situation there are similar comments that taller people have better promotion 
prospects and earn higher salaries than short people. (We leave you to make your own judge-
ment about this claim!) 
 In a discussion of physical attributes and good leadership,  Dib suggests that ‘we seem to asso-
ciate the eff ectiveness of leaders with certain personality traits, which are in turn assumed as a 
consequence of their looks’. Examples are gender, hair colour, face, height, ethnicity and weight. 
 Of course there is no scientifi c evidence of correlation between height and intelligence, or 
height and the ability to lead people. Yet tall people are massively overrepresented in leader-
ship roles. Similarly, other illogical preferences on hair colour, weight and facial features have 
nestled into our subconscious through societal, cultural and historical channels, and continue 
to aff ect the decisions we make and the leaders we turn to. 
 Dib reports that there are convincing arguments for why we need to confront and overhaul 
ingrained preconceptions and stereotypes. 22  (Stereotyping is discussed below.) 
 Note also that  Mintzberg includes ‘tall’ in a composite list of basic managerial qualities.  23 
 (See  Figure  16.3 in  Chapter  16 .) 
 Framing 
 The term ‘framing’ is used to explain how we interpret particular circumstances. Rather like a 
picture frame, we place into the frame our particular perspective, focus and colour on things. So 
if we are feeling happy our experience is being ‘framed’ in a positive way. What is in the ‘frame’ 
will depend on what is fi ltered in or out. Whether we look at a diffi  cult situation as a ‘problem’ or 
as an opportunity, or whether we see a mistake as a terrible failure or as a learning moment, will 
depend on how we have ‘framed’ the experience. If we are in a good mood we may only fi lter in 
messages from our environment that confi rm our happy state; we may create an inner dialogue in 
which our inner voice is reaffi  rming why we are feeling so content. We may also be visualising a 
situation in which we are successful and these thoughts are establishing neural pathways. Helping 
people to reframe situations can be part of the mentoring and coaching process  (see  Chapter  5 ). 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 We often mask what we really feel, act in ways that cover our true emotions and speak words that we do not really 
mean. In our dealings with other people we need to look beyond what is seen and heard and delve beneath the surface. 
 To what extent do YOU mask YOUR feelings and emotions? How do YOU think we can best judge the true beliefs and 
intentions of other people? 

196
Part 2  The individual	
Perceiving other people
There are a number of well-documented difficulties that arise when perceiving other people. 
Many of these problems occur because of our limitations in selecting and attending informa-
tion. This selectivity may occur because:
● we already know what we are looking for and are therefore ‘set’ to receive only the informa-
tion that confirms our initial thoughts;
● previous training and experience have led us to shortcut and see only a certain range of 
behaviours;
● we may group features together and make assumptions about their similarities.
The Gestalt principles apply equally well to the perception of people as to the perception 
of objects. Thus we can see, for example, that if people live in the same geographical area, 
assumptions may be made about not only their wealth and type of accommodation, but also 
their attitudes, their political views and even their type of personality.
To interact effectively (present ourselves and communicate appropriately, influence others, 
work with them in relationships and groups or lead them) we must have a grasp of what oth-
ers are thinking and feeling, including their motives, beliefs, attitudes and intentions. In social 
perception, accuracy and differentiation are essential but difficult. Achieving them may be 
linked to the complexity of a person’s system of cognitive constructs.24
The way we see others, the habits we have formed, the associations we have made and the 
assumptions we make lead us to make errors and distortions when perceiving others. The focus 
of the following section is to examine the perception of people and to consider the impact 
this has on the management and development of people at work. The principles of perceptual 
differences explained earlier apply to the way we perceive others. Some examples might be as 
follows:
● Grouping – The way in which a manager may think of a number of staff, for example either 
working in close proximity, or with some common feature such as all IT staff, all graduate 
trainees or all older workers; as a homogeneous group rather than a collection of individu-
als, each with their own separate identity and characteristics.
● Figure and ground – A manager may notice a new recruit and set the recruit apart from the 
group because of particular characteristics such as age, appearance or physical features.
● Closure – The degree to which unanimity is perceived and decisions made or action taken 
in the belief that there is full agreement with staff when, in fact, a number of staff may be 
opposed to the decision or action.
A manager’s perception of the workforce will influence attitudes in dealing with people and 
the style of managerial behaviour adopted. The way in which managers approach the perfor-
mance of their jobs and the behaviour they display towards subordinate staff are likely to be 
conditioned by predispositions about people, human nature and work. An example of this is 
the style of management adopted on the basis of McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y sup-
positions (discussed in Chapter 10). In making judgements about other people it is important 
to try to perceive their underlying intent and motivation, not just the resultant behaviour or 
actions.
The perception of people’s performance can be affected by the organisation of stimuli. In 
employment interviews, for example, interviewers are susceptible to contrast effects and the 
perception of a candidate may be influenced by the rating given to immediately preceding can-
didates. Average candidates may be rated highly if they follow people with low qualifications, 
but rated lower when following people with higher qualifications.25
Recognising assumptions held and testing these out requires a heightened level of critical 
reflection. Many leadership and management development courses start with a ‘self-awareness 
and diagnostic’ module intended to help participants understand and recognise their style and 

Chapter 6  Perception and communication
197
preferences and the impact on others. Courses that take a more challenging stance will encour-
age managers to question their existing frames of mind and challenge them constantly to re-
evaluate their purpose, strategies and action.
Dynamics of interpersonal perception
Unlike the perception of an object that just exists, when you perceive another individual they 
will react to you and be affected by your behaviour – the dynamics are all-important. This 
interaction is illustrated in the following quotation:
You are a pain in the neck and to stop you giving me a pain in the neck I protect my neck by 
tightening my neck muscles, which gives me the pain in the neck you are.26
The interaction of individuals thus provides an additional layer of interpretation and com-
plexity. The cue that we may attend to, the expectation we may have, the assumptions we may 
make, the response pattern that occurs, leave more scope for errors and distortions. We are 
not only perceiving the stimulus (i.e. the other person), but also processing their reactions to 
us at the same time that they are processing our reactions to them. Thus interpersonal percep-
tion differs from the perception of objects because it is a continually dynamic and changing 
process, and the perceiver is a part of this process who will influence and be influenced by the 
other people in the situation (see Figure 6.12).27

part 2 THE IndIVIduAL 
 Setting and environment 
 Interpersonal perception will also be aff ected by the setting, and the environment may play a 
critical part in establishing rapport. For example, next time you are involved in a formal meet-
ing such as attending an in-house development centre, consider the following factors that will 
all infl uence the perceptual process: 
 Why? 
 Purpose of and motives for 
meeting 
 Likely to be an important event for the par-
ticipant, may be a catalyst for promotion 
and may signal new and relevant develop-
ment opportunities. Chance to be visible and 
demonstrate skills and abilities. Opportunity 
to network with other managers. Thus high 
emotional cost to participant 
 Who? 
 Status/role/age/gender/ethnic 
group/appearance/personality/
interests/attitudes 
 How participant prepares for the event will 
be infl uenced by factors listed opposite 
and previous history and encounters of all 
parties  
 When? 
 Time, date of meeting 
 The timing of the event might be particularly 
aff ected by events outside of the workplace. 
So if the participant has dependants or 
responsibilities, the timing of this event may 
become signifi cant. If the participant is asked 
to attend in the middle of a religious festival, 
then again the relevance of time is critical 
 Where? 
 Environment/culture 
 Organisations will often stage development 
events away from the ‘normal’ workplace 
in an attempt to bring about objectivity 
and neutrality. How the event is staged, the 
amount of structure and formality, how feed-
back is given, the demonstration of power 
and control will be evidence of the culture of 
the organisation 
 How? 
 Past experience/rapport 
 The experience of the development event will 
in part be infl uenced by the expectations of 
the participant. If this is the second develop-
ment centre, then experiences of the fi rst will 
colour the perceptions; if this is the fi rst cen-
tre, then the participant may be infl uenced 
by previous experiences of similar events 
(selection event) or by stories from previous 
attendees 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Most people do not consciously think about the person with whom they are interacting. They translate their view of 
the world around them from their own perceptions and assume that others are working from the same view. 
 To what extent are YOU able to challenge this assertion? How well do you think YOU relate to, and interact with, 
other people? 

Chapter 6  Perception and communication
199
The importance of language and 
communication
Our language plays an important role in the way we perceive and communicate with the 
world. Language not only labels and distinguishes the environment for us, but also structures 
and guides our thinking patterns.
Marrs points out that every profession has its own language. For example, accountants and 
marketing executives are experts at bamboozlement and mysterious acronyms but perhaps the 
IT profession has the worst reputation.
Managers need to get straight answers from their IT professionals at several key points in the 
business cycle . . . If the IT department can’t communicate without using jargon or acro-
nyms . . . then you have got a solution looking for a problem rather than the other way 
round . . . Senior managers have to pick the people to run their IT departments. They need 
those who have technical skills – but who are also able to communicate IT considerations 
simply to the rest of the business.28
Language as part of culture
Our language is part of the culture we experience and learn to take for granted. Culture differ-
ences are relevant because they emphasise the impact of social learning on the perception of peo-
ple and their surroundings. Language not only reflects our experiences, but also shapes whether 
and what we experience. It influences our relationships with others and with the environment.
Consider a situation where a student is using a library in a UK university for the first time. 
The student is from South Asia, where the word ‘please’ is incorporated in the verb and in 
intonation; a separate word is not used. When the student requests help, the assistant may 
consider the student rude because they did not use the word ‘please’. By causing offence the 
student has quite innocently affected the library assistant’s perceptions.
Much is also communicated in how words are said and in the silences between words. In the 
UK, speech is suggestive and idiomatic speech is common: ‘Make no bones about it’ (means 
get straight to the point), ‘Sent to Coventry’ (means to be socially isolated). And action is 
implied rather than always stated: ‘I hope you won’t mind if I’ (means ‘I am going to’), ‘I’m 
afraid I really can’t see my way to . . . ’ (means ‘no’).
Conversational pitfalls
A well-known quotation, attributed to George Bernard Shaw, is:
England and America are two countries divided by a common language.
From frequent visits to America, the author can give numerous personal testimonies to this, 
including these actual words: ‘I am just going to the trunk (boot of the car) to get my purse 
(handbag), fanny bag (bum bag) and money wallet (purse).’
McCrum gives some examples of conversational pitfalls29(many of which the present 
author can attest to from personal experience).

Non-verbal communication  
and body language
We have referred previously to the significance of non-verbal communication and body lan-
guage. This includes inferences drawn from posture, gestures, touch, the use of personal space 
(proxemics), extent of eye contact, tone of voice or facial expressions. People are the only 
animals that speak, laugh and weep. Actions are more cogent than speech and humans rely 
heavily on body language to convey their true feelings and meanings.30
As ‘Pease and Pease’ point out:
All things are not what they seem. The ability to work out what is really happening with a 
person is simple – not easy, but simple. It’s about matching what you see and hear to the 
environment in which it all happens and drawing possible conclusions. Most people, however, 
only see the things they think they are seeing.31
According to Mehrabian, in our face-to-face communication with other people as much as 
93 per cent of the messages about our feelings and attitudes come from non-verbal channels:
7 per cent from the words we use;
38 per cent from our voice; and
55 per cent from body language, including facial expressions.
Significantly, when body language such as gestures and tone of voice conflicts with the words, 
greater emphasis is likely to be placed on the non-verbal message.32
Although actual percentages may vary, there appears to be general support for this con-
tention. According to Pivcevic, ‘It is commonly agreed that 80 per cent of communication is 
non-verbal; it is carried in your posture and gestures, and in the tone, pace and energy behind 
what you say.’33
McGuire suggests that when verbal and non-verbal messages are in conflict, ‘Accepted wis-
dom from the experts is that the non-verbal signals should be the ones to rely on, and that 
what is not said is frequently louder than what is said, revealing attitudes and feelings in a way 
words can’t express.’34
According to James, in a sense we are all experts on body language already and this is part 
of the survival instinct:
Even in a ‘safe’ environment like an office or meeting room you will feel a pull on your gaze 
each time someone new enters the room. And whether you want to or not, you will start to 
form opinions about a person in as little as three seconds. You can try to be fair and objec-
tive in your evaluation, but you will have little choice. This is an area where the subconscious 

Chapter 6 PErcEPTIOn And cOMMunIcATIOn
201
mind bullies the conscious into submission. Like, dislike, trust, love or lust can all be promoted 
in as long as it takes to clear your throat. In fact most of these responses will be based on your 
perception of how the person looks. 35 
 In our perceptions and judgement of others it is important therefore to observe and take 
careful note of their non-verbal communication. Managers should also be aware of the sub-
conscious message that their own body language conveys to members of staff . For example, 
 Kennett  points out that we take signals from our leaders, and if managers are exhibiting signs 
of anxiety their body language and critical talk will amplify employees’ susceptibility to 
stress. 36   However, although body language may be a guide to personality, errors can easily arise 
if too much is inferred from a single message rather than a related cluster of actions. 
 Consider the simple action of a handshake and the extent to which this can provide a mean-
ingful insight into personality. Does a fi rm handshake by itself necessarily indicate friendship 
and confi dence? And is a limp handshake a sign of shyness or lack of engagement with the 
other person? The reality is that body language is not a precise science. One gesture can be 
interpreted in several ways. It may give a possible indication of a particular meaning but by 
itself cannot be interpreted with any certainty. Crossing the arms is often taken as a sign of 
defensiveness but could equally mean that the person is feeling cold or fi nds this a comfortable 
position. 37 Despite these limitations, it is essential that managers have an understanding of 
non-verbal communication and body language and are fully cognisant of the possible mes-
sages they are giving out. 
 Cultural diff erences 
 There are many cultural variations in non-verbal communications, the extent of physical con-
tact and diff erences in the way body language is perceived and interpreted. Italians and South 
Americans tend to show their feelings through intense body language, while the Japanese 
tend to hide their feelings and have largely eliminated overt body language from interpersonal 
communication. When talking to another person, the British tend to look away spasmodi-
cally, but Norwegians typically look people steadily in the eye without altering their gaze. In 
South Korea, women refrain from shaking hands. The Japanese often have a weak handshake, 
whereas in the UK a fi rm handshake is encouraged. When the Dutch point a forefi nger at their 
temples this is likely to be a sign of congratulations for a good idea, but with other cultures 
the gesture has a less complimentary implication. In many European countries it is customary 
to greet people with three or four kisses on the cheek and pulling the head away may be taken 
as a sign of impoliteness. 
 All cultures have specifi c values related to proxemics, that is the use of personal space and 
‘comfort zone’. Arabs tend to stand very close when speaking to another person, but most 
Americans when introduced to a new person will, after shaking hands, move backwards a 
couple of steps to place a comfortable space between themselves and the person they have just 
met. One reason why Americans tend to speak loudly is that their sense of personal space is 
twice that of the British. 38 (See also discussion on violation of territory in  Chapter  3 .) A con-
cept map of interacting and networking with other people is set out in  Figure  6.13 . 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 There are so many forms of non-verbal communication cues, either intentional or unintentional, that can be 
interpreted in different ways. There are also wide cultural variations in the context and essential meaning of 
the cues. Attempting to make valid inferences from body language is of little real value and its use should be 
discouraged. 
 How would YOU argue against this assertion? How well can YOU read body language and non-verbal communication?

Interpersonal communications
It is difficult to consider the process of interpersonal perception without commenting on how 
people communicate. Communication and perception are inextricably bound. How we com-
municate to our colleagues, boss, subordinates, friends and partners will depend on our per-
ception of them, on our ‘history’ with them, on their emotional state.
Fitzherbert draws an interesting comparison between magic, perception and communication.
Magicians are acutely aware that the moment people see, hear, feel, taste or smell anything 
it automatically triggers a range of expectations and perceptions in their minds. In effect, it 
opens up a ‘file’ in their brain that tells them what they already know about the subject and 
rejects anything that doesn’t fit. Magicians build their communication and effects around the 
expectations and perceptions they trigger.
Clarity and impact aside, communication will be effective only if you can convince the audi-
ence about what you are telling them or showing them. Fitzherbert sets out twenty rules of 
perception and communication, shown in Figure 6.14.39

Getting your message across
Baguley points out that workplace communication can have a variety of aims and objectives, 
and if it is going to be successful there must be a two-way process. Channels of communica-
tion are proliferating but many people still struggle to get their message across effectively. It 
is important to use the right medium for your message: ‘I’m appalled by incidents like, for 
example, sacking employees by text message’. To be a good communicator, Baguley suggests 
you need the following skills and understanding:
● Listen actively, rather than passively.
● ‘Wear the other person’s shoes’ and understand the why and how of where that other per-
son is coming from.
● Empathise with what is being said and felt by the other person.
● Be aware of and carefully observe body language.
● Plan your communication to take into account your objectives, the needs and abilities of 
the other person, the social and physical environment of the communication and the nature 
of the message.40
Importance of feedback
Feedback is a vital ingredient of the communication process. We may misjudge the receiver 
and regard our communication as unsuccessful, but unless we have some feedback from the 
other party we may never know whether what we have said or done was received in the way 
it was intended. The feedback may reaffirm our perceptions of the person or it may force 
us to review our perceptions. In our dealings with more senior staff the process of com-
munication can be of special significance, including non-verbal communication, posture 
and tone.41
Two major approaches to, and ways of explaining, interpersonal communications are 
neuro-linguistic programming and transactional analysis.
Neuro-linguistic programming
Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) emerged in the early 1970s as an offshoot of psychother-
apy, psychology and hypnotherapy. It represents a collection of ideas and appears to offer lots 
of different things to different people. A popular definition of NLP is in terms of a model of 
interpersonal communication concerned with the relationship between successful patterns of 
behaviour and subjective experiences that underlie them. John Grinder and Richard Bandler, 
the co-founders of NLP, saw it as a means of helping to provide people with better, fuller and 
richer lives.42 It is an approach that aims to enhance the effectiveness of interpersonal com-
munications and facilitate learning and personal development. The name originates from the 
three disciplines that all have a part to play when people are communicating with others: neu-
rology, linguistics and programming.
● Neurology – the nervous system, and processes linking body and mind.
● Linguistics – the study of words and how these are understood and communicated.
● Programming – refers to behaviours and strategies used by individuals.
The application of NLP shifted from therapy situations to work organisations, with clear 
messages for communicating and managing others. NLP emphasises the significance of the 
perceptual process and the way in which information is subjectively filtered and interpreted. 

Chapter 6  Perception and communication
205
These interpretations are influenced by others and the world in which we live. Gradually, 
individuals learn to respond and their reactions and strategies become programmed, locked 
in, automatic.
Awareness and change
At its heart, NLP concerns awareness and change. Initially knowing and monitoring one’s 
own behaviour and being able consciously to choose different reactions are fundamental to 
the process. Selecting from a range of verbal and non-verbal behaviours ensures control hap-
pens and changes ‘automatic’ reactions into consciously chosen programmes. Many different 
approaches and techniques are incorporated into NLP. Some concern mirroring and matching 
the micro-skills of communication in terms of body movements, breathing patterns or voice 
tempo. Others concern the positive thinking required in goal-setting ‘outcome thinking’ and 
the personal resources required in its achievement.
Another feature of NLP is ‘anchors’ that we all have. Anchors are ‘triggers’ that help keep 
habits in place and put us in a certain state of mind.43
Anchors can be visual, like people, clothes and cars. They can be auditory, like a particular 
piece of music, an advertising jingle or the voice of a dear friend. They can be kinaesthetic, 
like the feel of your favourite clothes, sitting in your armchair or the warmth of a hot bath. 
They can be olfactory or gustatory, like the smell of a hospital (why do they all smell the 
same?) or the taste of coffee or chocolate (Lindt!). Words can be anchors because they evoke 
ideas; your name is a powerful anchor for your identity. Anchors evoke emotional states and 
most of the time we do not notice the anchors, only the states. Some anchors are neutral. 
Some put us into good states. Others put us into bad states.44
Agness suggests that in a tough market NLP can be applied to the main challenges faced by 
today’s leaders, and identifies three main skills of NLP that help to get on customers’ wavelength:
● Sensory acuity – developing an acute sense of awareness of what is going on around you 
moment to moment, and changes in your customer’s physiology.
● Rapport building – developing fast a strong connection with your customers.
● Improving sensory awareness – intuitively picking up non-verbal signals in others. Increas-
ing sensory acuity will improve communication with others.45
NLP and coaching
NLP has attracted considerable interest in recent years and there are a number of passionate 
devotees. There are numerous courses and seminars intended to demonstrate to participants 
how they can learn the skills to change themselves for improved personal or professional effec-
tiveness and a greater enjoyment from life. It is also a popular approach to coaching (discussed 
in Chapter 5). Paul McKenna, the well-known television hypnotist, is a registered NLP practi-
tioner and makes use of NLP principles in his courses on life training, including for example 
helping people to lose weight.
Paxton-Doggett reports on the use of NLP as part of executive coaching in business to aid 
freer and more open thinking in employees, and to achieve better results professionally and 
personally.
Underlying much modern coaching practice is ‘Neuro-linguistic programming’ or NLP. 
Rather than simply moving a person towards new goals, NLP works on a more fundamental 
level by exploring the interaction of thoughts (Neuro), verbal and non-verbal communication 
(Linguistic) and patterns of behaviour and emotional responses (Programming). By using the 
methodology and techniques of NLP in coaching, thinking and behaviour are changed and 
different results produced.46

part 2 THE IndIVIduAL 
 Transactional analysis 
 Transactional analysis (TA) is one of the most popular ways of explaining the dynamics of 
interpersonal communication. Originally developed by  Eric Berne, it is a model of people and 
relationships that encompasses personality, perception and communication. 47 Although Berne 
used it initially as a method of psychotherapy, it has been convincingly used by organisations 
as a training and development programme. 
 TA has two basic underlying assumptions: 
 ●  All the events and feelings that we have ever experienced are stored within us and can be 
replayed, so we can re-experience the events and the feelings of all our past years. 
 ●  Personality is made up of three ego states that are revealed in distinct ways of behaving. The 
ego states manifest themselves in gesture, tone of voice and action, almost as if they are dif-
ferent people within us, and they converse with each other in ‘transactions’, either overtly 
or covertly. 
 Berne identifi ed and labelled the ego states as follows, each with their own system of commu-
nication and language: 
 ●  Adult ego state – behaviour that concerns our thought processes and the processing of facts 
and information. In this state we may be objective, rational, reasonable – seeking informa-
tion and receiving facts. 
 ●  Parent ego state – behaviour that concerns the attitudes, feelings and behaviour incorpo-
rated from external sources, primarily our parents. This state refers to feelings about right 
and wrong and how to care for other people. 
 ●  Child ego state – behaviour that demonstrates the feelings we remember as a child. This 
state may be associated with having fun, playing, impulsiveness, rebelliousness, spontane-
ous behaviour and emotional responses. 
 Berne believed that these transactions, which take place in face-to-face exchanges and verbal 
communication, form the core of human relationships. He claimed that the three ego states 
exist simultaneously within each individual, although at any particular time any one state 
may dominate the other two. All people are said to behave in each of these states at diff erent 
times. We may be unaware which ego state we are operating in and may shift from one to 
another. 
 Preferred ego state 
 We all have a preferred ego state which we may revert to: some individuals may continually 
advise and criticise others (the constant Parents); some may analyse, live only with facts and 
distrust feelings (the constant Adult); some operate with strong feelings all the time, consumed 
with anger or constantly clowning (the constant Child). Berne emphasised that the states 
should not be judged as superior or inferior but as diff erent. Analysis of ego states may reveal 
why communication breaks down or why individuals may feel manipulated or used. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Although much is written about the value of neuro-linguistic programming (nLP) it is really no more than an assem-
bly of different ideas. It is a difficult concept to grasp and too abstract and theoretic to have meaningful applications 
for the practical manager. 
 What do YOU think? If YOU were a manager how might YOU apply NLP in a meaningful manner? 

Chapter 6  Perception and communication
207
Berne insists that it is possible to identify the ego state from the words, voice, gestures and 
attitude of the person communicating. For example, it would be possible to discern the ego 
state of a manager if they said the following:
‘Pass me the file on the latest sales figures.’
‘How do you think we could improve our safety record?’
(Adult ego state)
‘Let me help you with that – I can see you are struggling.’
‘Look, this is the way it should be done; how many more times do I have to tell you?’
(Parent ego state)
‘Great, it’s Friday. Who’s coming to the pub for a quick half?’
‘That’s a terrific idea – let’s go for it!’
(Child ego state)
Understanding human behaviour
Knowledge of TA can be of benefit to employees who are dealing with potentially difficult 
situations. In the majority of work situations the Adult–Adult transactions are likely to be the 
norm. Where work colleagues perceive and respond by adopting the Adult ego state, such a 
transaction is more likely to encourage a rational, problem-solving approach and reduce the 
possibility of emotional conflict.
Given the incidence of stress in the workplace, analysis of communication may be one way 
of understanding such conflict. By focusing on the interactions occurring within the work-
place, TA can aid the understanding of human behaviour. It can help to improve communica-
tion skills by assisting in interpreting a person’s ego state and which form of state is likely to 
produce the most appropriate response. This should lead to an improvement in both customer 
relations and management–subordinate relations. Therefore TA can be seen as a valuable tool 
to aid our understanding of social situations and the games that people play, both in and out-
side work organisations.48
Attribution theory
Part of the process of perceiving other people is to attribute characteristics to them. We judge 
their behaviour and intentions on past knowledge and in comparison with other people we 
know. It is our way of making sense of their behaviour. This is known as attribution theory. 
Attribution is the process by which people interpret the perceived causes of behaviour. The 
initiator of attribution theory is generally recognised as Heider, who suggests that behaviour 
is determined by a combination of perceived internal forces and external forces.49 Internal 
forces relate to personal attributes such as ability, skill, amount of effort or fatigue. External 
forces relate to environmental factors such as organisational rules and policies, the manner of 
superiors, or the weather. Behaviour at work may be explained by the locus of control, that is 
whether each individual perceives outcomes as controlled by themselves or by external factors. 
Judgements made about other people will also be influenced strongly by whether the cause is 
seen as internal or external.
Basic criteria in making attributions
In making attributions and determining whether an internal or external attribution is chosen, 
Kelley suggests three basic criteria: distinctiveness, consensus and consistency.
● Distinctiveness – How distinctive or different was the behaviour or action in this particular 
task or situation compared with behaviour or action in other tasks or situations?
● Consensus – Is the behaviour or action different from, or in keeping with, that displayed by 
most other people in the same situation?

208
Part 2  The individual	
● Consistency – Is the behaviour or action associated with an enduring personality or moti-
vational characteristic over time, or an unusual one-off situation caused by external factors?
Kelley hypothesised that people attribute behaviour to internal forces or personal factors when 
they perceive low distinctiveness, low consensus and high consistency. Behaviour is attributed 
to external forces or environmental factors when people perceive high distinctiveness, high 
consensus and low consistency.50
Implications of attribution theory
Employees with an internal control orientation are more likely to believe that they can influ-
ence their level of performance through their own abilities, skills or efforts. Employees with 
an external control orientation are more likely to believe that their level of performance is 
determined by external factors beyond their influence.
People with a high-achievement motivation may perceive that successful performance is 
caused by their own internal forces and their ability and effort rather than by the nature of the 
task or by luck. If members of staff fail to perform well on their tasks they may believe that 
external factors are the cause and as a result may reduce the level of future effort. However, if 
staff perform well but the manager perceives this as due to an easy task or to luck, the appro-
priate recognition and reward may not be given. If staff perceive that good performance was 
due to ability and/or effort, the lack of recognition and reward may well have a demotivating 
effect. (Achievement motivation is discussed in Chapter 7.)
Perceptual distortions and errors
We have seen that our perception results in different people seeing different things and attach-
ing different meanings to the same stimuli. Every person sees things in their own way and as 
perceptions become a person’s reality this can lead to misunderstandings. The accuracy of 
interpersonal perception and the judgements made about other people are influenced by:
● the nature of the relationship between the perceiver and the other person;
● the amount of information available to the perceiver and the order in which information is 
received;
● the nature and extent of interaction between the two people.
There are five main features that can create particular difficulties and give rise to perceptual 
problems, bias or distortions in our dealings with other people. These are:
● stereotyping
● the halo effect
● perceptual defence
● projection
● self-fulfilling prophecy.
To which could be added a sixth:
● unconscious bias.
See Figure 6.15.
These difficulties with people perception arise because of selectivity that exists in the percep-
tual process. We do not enjoy living in a world where uncertainty abounds and our perceptual 
system works to minimise energy consumption. We do not have to start every day afresh – we 
have our store of memories and experiences to guide us. The paradox is that this process is also 
our downfall.

 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Bias and prejudice are inherent features of interpersonal perception and communication. Although exhortations 
can be made for us to become more aware of our own biases and to take more time in making judgements, we are 
working against our normal quick-fire perceptual system. 
 Do YOU believe this is fair comment? To what extent are YOU aware of YOUR own bias and prejudice? 
 Stereotyping 
 This is the tendency to ascribe positive or negative characteristics to a person on the basis 
of a general categorisation and perceived similarities. The perception of that person may 
be based more on certain expected characteristics than on the recognition of that person 
as an individual. It is a form of typecasting.  Stereotyping is a means of simplifying the 
process of perception, making sense of the world and making judgements of other people 
instead of dealing with a range of complex and alternative stimuli. When a person is judged 
on the basis of the group to which it is perceived that the person belongs and as having 
the same characteristics, we are stereotyping. Pre-judgements are therefore made about an 
individual without ever really knowing whether such judgements are accurate; they may be 
wildly wrong. 

210
Part 2  The individual	
Common stereotyping may be based on, for example:
● Nationality – Germans are orderly and industrious; Australians like cricket.
● Occupation – accountants are boring; librarians are serious and undemonstrative.
● Age – young people are unreliable; old people do not want to learn new ideas.
● Physical – people with red hair have a fiery temperament; people with visible tattoos are 
exhibitionists.
● Education – graduates are intelligent; graduates from Oxford or Cambridge are especially 
bright.
● Social – unemployed people are lazy; immigrants do not want to learn English.
● Politics – Labour voters favour strong trade unions; Conservative voters support private 
enterprise.
(See also the discussion of social identity theory in Chapter 8.)
Social implications
Stereotyping infers that all people within a particular perceived category are assumed to share 
the same traits or characteristics. A significant social implication of stereotyping is therefore 
the perception held about particular groups of people based on, for example, ethnicity, gender, 
disability, appearance, sexual orientation, age or religious belief. Stereotyping condenses the 
amount of information that we need to know and thus enables us to cope with a vast infor-
mation flow. However, the consequences of attributing incorrect characteristics are extremely 
negative. Stereotyping can lead to misinterpretation, bias and a failure to try and really under-
stand other people.51
A major danger of stereotyping is that it can block out accurate perception of the indi-
vidual or individual situation. Stereotyping may lead to potential situations of prejudice or 
discrimination. An example might be the perception of people with HIV or AIDS.52 Stereotyp-
ing may work either negatively or favourably for a particular group of people. For example, 
a sizeable number of employers still appear to maintain negative and inaccurate stereotypes 
about the capabilities and training of older workers. However, some firms, such as B&Q, the 
home improvement chain, have a policy of staffing certain stores with people over 50 years of 
age. (See the case study at the end of Chapter 4.)
The halo effect
The halo effect is the process by which the perception of a person is formulated on the basis 
of a single (or single series of) favourable or unfavourable trait or impression. The halo effect 
tends to shut out other relevant characteristics of that person. Some examples might be as 
follows:
● A candidate for employment who arrives punctually, is smart in appearance and friendly 
may well influence the perception of the selectors, who then place less emphasis on the 
candidate’s technical ability, qualifications or experience for the job.
● A new member of staff who performs well in a first major assignment may be perceived as a 
likely person for promotion, even though that assignment is not typical of the usual duties 
the member of staff is expected to undertake.
● A single trait, such as good attendance and timekeeping, may become the main emphasis 
for judgement of overall competence and performance rather than other considerations 
such as the quantity, quality and accuracy of work.
A particular danger with the halo effect is that where quick judgements are made on the basis 
of readily available stimuli, the perceiver may become ‘perceptually blind’ to subsequent stim-
uli at variance with the original perception and (often subconsciously) notice only those char-
acteristics that support the original judgement. (See also the self-fulfilling prophecy, discussed 
below.)

Chapter 6  Perception and communication
211
The rusty halo effect
The process may also work in reverse: the rusty halo effect. This is where general judgements 
about a person are formulated from the perception of a negative characteristic. For example, 
a candidate is seen arriving late for an interview. There may be a very good reason for this and 
it may be completely out of character. But on the basis of that one particular event the person 
may be perceived as a poor timekeeper and unreliable. Another example may be a new mem-
ber of staff who performs poorly in a first major assignment. This may have been due to an 
unusual set of circumstances and not typical behaviour, but the person may still be perceived 
as a bad appointment.
Perceptual defence
Perceptual defence is the tendency to avoid or screen out certain stimuli that conflict with 
strongly held values and are perceptually disturbing or threatening. People may tend to select 
information that is supportive of their point of view and choose not to acknowledge contrary 
information. For example, a manager who has refused steadfastly to support promotion for 
a member of staff against the advice of other colleagues may select only unfavourable infor-
mation which supports that decision and ignore favourable information which questions that 
decision.
Projection
Attributing, or projecting, one’s own feelings, motives or characteristics to other people is a 
further distortion that can occur in the perception of other people. Judgements of other peo-
ple may be more favourable when they have characteristics largely in common with, and eas-
ily recognised by, the perceiver. Projection may also result in people exaggerating undesirable 
traits in others that they fail to recognise in themselves.
Perception is distorted by feelings and emotions. Projection may be used as a means of 
attempting to externalise difficult or uncomfortable feelings. For example, a manager who 
is concerned about possible redundancy may perceive other managers to be even more con-
cerned. People have a tendency to perceive others less favourably by projecting certain of their 
own feelings or characteristics onto them. As another example, supervisors may complain that 
their manager did not work hard enough to secure additional resources for the department 
when in fact the supervisors failed to provide the manager with all the relevant information 
and statistics. However, projection may also be used to externalise positive feelings onto other 
members of staff by attempting to create an overstated and unrealistic level of expectations 
and performance. (Perception of ‘self’ and how people see and think of themselves, and evalu-
ate themselves, are discussed in Chapter 8.)
Self-fulfilling prophecy
A common feature of social interaction is the concept of the self-fulfilling prophecy (some-
times known as the Pygmalion effect), a term that is usually attributed to Merton.53The essence 
of the prophecy is that simply because it has been made, this will cause it to happen. People 
strive to validate their perceptions irrespective of the actual reality. People’s beliefs or expecta-
tions influence their actions and behaviour in such a way as to make the beliefs or expectations 
more likely to come true. If staff believe a rumour (prophecy) that there will be no promotions 
or bonuses for the foreseeable future, they are likely to behave in such a way that their perfor-
mance would not justify promotion or bonuses (even if the rumour was not true).
The expectation of managers has a powerful influence on the behaviour and performance 
of staff.  (See McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y assumptions in Chapter 10.)  If a manager 
expects only minimal performance from staff, they are not likely to perform to the best of their 
abilities. Therefore, managers need to establish an organisational framework and supportive 

212
part 2 THE IndIVIduAL 
culture that reinforces positive performance expectations at all levels of the organisation. Staff  
should also be encouraged to have high self-expectations of performance through working 
towards common goals. 
 Unconscious bias 
 Dan Robertson, Diversity and Inclusion Director of Employers Network for Equality and 
Inclusion, in conversation with  Davies, draws attention to our ‘preferred people preferences’ 
that aff ect our unconscious social preferences. This type of  unconscious bias may be demon-
strated in ‘micro-behaviours’. 
 For example, we may exhibit an affi  nity bias, where we respond positively to people who are 
similar to us or with whom we have something in common. We might give that person more 
airtime in a meeting, or agree more often with what they say. In contrast, we might cut short 
those with whom we do not have an affi  nity or disregard their viewpoints. 
 These are subtle, unconscious behaviours and diff erent from overt and discriminatory behav-
iour. Robertson maintains that such unconscious biases are hard-wired into us. We cannot 
eliminate them altogether so it is important to be aware of them and to change the way we 
work. 54 
  Understanding the organisational process 
 The process of perception has been outlined as selective and subjective: we perceive the world 
in our own terms and expect the world to ‘fi t’ into our constructs. Throughout our develop-
ment we learn to distinguish what is important and signifi cant (fi gure) from information that 
is additional and contextual (ground). This process is repeated when we join new organisa-
tions or take a new job within the same organisation. Fitting into the organisation involves 
selecting information that is necessary from that which is less signifi cant. At times, the process 
can be distorted and we can also be ‘tricked’ into seeing the world in particular ways. 
 Although some organisations may discriminate, stereotyped perceptions are not always cal-
culated: they are often made automatically and without conscious thought – in much the same 
way as we may be tricked by visual illusions. In fact, perceptual illusions are a very appropriate 
way of understanding the organisational setting. 
 For any organisation to be eff ective it is imperative that the staff  are competent to undertake 
their work and satisfy the ‘psychological contract’  (discussed in  Chapter  1 ). Part of the role of 
managers is to select and train individuals whom they predict will perform successfully on the 
job, and then to monitor and assess their competence for promotion. Accordingly, it is clearly 
important for managers to be aware of their own prejudices and assumptions. By opening 
channels and encouraging and developing all staff , trust might be fed back into the system 
from which equality and inclusion could fl ourish. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 It is not unreasonable to argue that there is no such thing as reality – only the individual’s perception or interpreta-
tion of reality. Yet, managers require an understanding of perception in order to help interpret the behaviour and 
intentions of other people. 
 How can this conundrum be overcome? If YOU were a manager how would YOU hope to avoid organisational prob-
lems that result from perceptual differences? 

CHAPTER 6 PERCEPTION AND COMMUNICATION
213
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  Perception is the root of all management and organisational behaviour and any situation can 
be analysed in terms of its perceptual connotations. 
  2  We all have our unique image of how we interpret the ‘reality’ of the world around us. A situa-
tion may be the same but individual interpretations may diﬀ er vastly. 
  3  The process of perception is based on both internal factors related to the individual’s sensory 
limits or thresholds and external factors related to the nature and characteristics of the stimuli.  
  4  Perception gives rise to individual behavioural responses in given situations. It is important to 
be aware of potential perceptual illusions and impression management. 
  5   Managers must take care with how they organise and make judgements about their percep-
tions of other people, including both positive and negative messages. 
  6  There are many potential diﬃ  culties when perceiving other people. The manager’s perception 
will inﬂ uence the style of behaviour and relationship with other staﬀ . 
  7   It is important to recognise the importance of the use of language and communication includ-
ing cultural diﬀ erences, and non-verbal communication and body language. 
  8  Perception and interpersonal communication are inextricably bound. Two major approaches 
to interpersonal communications are neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) and transactional 
analysis (TA). 
  9  Part of the process of perception is to attribute characteristics to other people. Attribution is 
the process by which people interpret the perceived causes of behaviour. 
  10  Perception results in diﬀ erent people attaching diﬀ erent meanings to the same stimulus. This 
gives rise to a number of potential perceptual distortions and errors. 
  1  Explain fully why an understanding of perception is important in the study of management and organisational 
behaviour. 
  2  Discuss, with your own examples, both internal and external factors that aﬀ ect selection and attention in the 
process of perception. 
  3  Debate the signiﬁ cance of impression management, including your own views on the importance of dress codes. 
  4  Identify clearly the most signiﬁ cant factors that you believe inﬂ uence the judgement of other people. Provide 
your own example of each of these factors. 
  5  Discuss fully the importance of language and communication in the process of perception. Give your own 
examples of conversational pitfalls. 
  6  Discuss critically the amount of attention that you believe should be given to non-verbal communications and 
body language.

to go. But ﬁ rst you need some more coﬀ ee – and, drat! 
The milk has run out so a quick trip to the corner store. 
And perhaps you can just have a quick glance at Face-
book. And then you can get on with it. Honestly. 
 If you are ‘human’, the chances are you may recog-
nise at least part of this scenario. The good news is that 
almost everybody else does. The less good news is that 
you will probably do it again. It is painful, it is frustrat-
ing, but it is true. Luckily, a few recent and highly read-
able studies by behavioural economists can give you an 
insight into why, and how it can be avoided. 
 Reason and irrationality 
 The basis for these ideas is the link between perception, 
thought and behaviour, and particularly our behaviour 
in terms of the economic decisions and choices peo-
ple make in their everyday life. Many of these choices 
are personal: how much to pay for a coﬀ ee at Waterloo 
train station, where to rent or buy a house, how much 
to put into a pension plan or why you should be the 
ﬁ rst to order your food when you go out to dinner with 
a group of friends. 55 However, the principles shed light 
on the perception – thought – behaviour process, which 
is equally important in organisational contexts. Some 
choices and decisions are speciﬁ cally related to man-
agement and organisational behaviour: matters of pay, 
reward, performance, honesty and discrimination. In 
the cases discussed, the decisions people make appear 
to be both irrational and entirely understandable. This 
was the starting point for Dan Ariely, who explains that 
behavioural economics is a relatively new ﬁ eld that links 
economics and psychology; it focuses on judgement 
and decision-making and seeks to identify the causes of 
‘irrational’ behaviour. Moreover, he considers that: 
  we are not only irrational, but  predictably irrational – 
that our irrationality happens in the same way, again 
and again. Whether we are acting as consumers, 
businesspeople or policy makers . . . Moreover, these 
irrational behaviors of ours are neither random nor

senseless. They are systematic, and since we repeat 
them again and again, predictable.56
Social and market norms
Much of Ariely’s research has been experimental, and 
one set of experiments offers an insight into the nature 
of the effort–reward bargain. Do we work harder when 
we are paid? Not necessarily. The experiment that 
revealed this involved three groups of participants who 
were asked to carry out a simple repetitive task of click-
ing and dragging circles across a computer screen using 
a mouse. The system counted how many circles were 
moved in the five minutes given for the task. Some 
groups were paid well for participating, others paid 
less well and yet others asked to take part as a favour. 
As anticipated, the well-paid worked harder than the 
poorly paid (by about 50 per cent), but the unpaid out-
performed both. Why? Ariely’s conclusion was that dif-
ferent norms had been applied – social ones rather than 
market ones – and that in many circumstances social 
norms are more effective motivators.
Does this mean organisations can use social norms 
as well as market norms to encourage effort? A group 
of lawyers was shown to be content to offer free legal 
advice to needy retired clients, but not at all likely to 
offer the same service for a reduced fee. Here social 
norms were powerful whereas market norms actually 
had a deterrent effect. Indeed, further experiments 
showed that even the mention of money could drive out 
social norms and change behaviour. The psychological 
technique of ‘priming’ (the creation of a certain set of 
expectations, indirectly, prior to some kind of activity) 
was used to introduce the idea of market norms to some 
people but not others, although nobody was actually 
going to be paid for taking part this time. Some partici-
pants were primed to think about money via a sentence 
unscrambling task before attempting a difficult visual 
puzzle (the sentences they were given used words like 
salary), and others were given neutral sentences. The 
behaviour of the primed participants during the puzzle 
element was notably different:
They were more selfish and self-reliant; they wanted 
to spend more time alone; they were more likely to 
select tasks that required individual input rather than 
teamwork; . . . Indeed, just thinking about money 
makes us behave as most economists believe we 
behave – and less like the social animals we are in our 
daily lives.57
Moreover, it seems that once we have switched over 
from social to market norms in our thinking, it is very 
difficult for us to switch back. The social relationship 
may have been irretrievably ruined.58
Obviously, the vast majority of work organisations 
rely on market norms to a significant extent, and rarely 
more so than when people are paid for performance. 
The link between pay and performance seems logical, 
and much managerial work involves performance mea-
surement and judgement with the aim of improving 
performance. For instance, when salaries were replaced 
by piecework in a car windscreen repair business 
(workers were paid per windscreen refit, and required 
to correct any mistakes they made without extra pay), 
productivity improved and errors were reduced.59 How-
ever, the problem for advocates of this type of incentive 
scheme is that performance in most jobs is not as easily 
measured as it is in the windscreen repair business, and 
workers will generally adjust their behaviour to achieve 
the measured targets, regardless of the overall result.
It’s simply too difficult for managers to work out the 
details of what should be done, and to judge whether 
what should be done is being done. The frustrations of 
working life are a direct result of that struggle.60
All you need is nudge
An example of the application of behavioural econom-
ics shows how people can be encouraged, rather than 
forced, to behave in ways that are seen to be beneficial 
(to themselves, to their communities, the environment, 
etc.) and deals with the age-old problem of why we can-
not seem to do things that we know are good for us or 
‘right’. We lack self-control, especially when costs are felt 
immediately but the pay-off does not arrive for some 
time. This is why dieting is hard but chatting on Face-
book is easy. We tend to defer changes to our behaviour 
and are over-optimistic about our future behaviour; our 
diets always start tomorrow and will be spectacularly 
effective. But it seems that we can be ‘nudged’ to change 
our future behaviour in a way that makes it stick. For 
instance, Thaler and Sunstein report on the success of the 
‘Save More Tomorrow’ plan as a means of encouraging 
people to contribute more sensibly to pension schemes. 
Instead of requiring people to contribute more of their 
pay today, they were asked to commit to increasing their 
savings in the future. The savings plan deducted the 
money from their salaries, and the increased deductions 
were timed to coincide with pay raises.
By synchronising pay raises and savings increases, 
participants never see their take-home amounts go 
down, and they don’t view their increased retirement 
contributions as losses.61

Chapter 6  Perception and communication
217
The scheme enlisted the power of four key behavioural 
responses to perceived factors. The ‘painful’ part was 
deferred; there was never a perception of ‘loss’, in this 
case of spending power; the system was easy and the 
default contributions were the increasing ones; and the 
power of inertia meant that opting out of the increases 
was more effort than staying in. The combined effects 
meant that the ‘nudge’ was effective, even though there 
was no obligation to continue with the increases.
Now, about that essay
A further practical example of this is the website cre-
ated by Yale Economics Professor Dean Karlan called 
‘StickK.com’ which is described as a ‘commitment store’, 
and which is based on two key principles of behavioural 
economics:
1.	 People do not always do what they claim they want 
to do.
2.	 Incentives get people to do things.
The process is described by Thaler and Sunstein:
An individual puts up money and agrees to accomplish 
a goal by a certain date. He also specifies how to 
verify that he has met his goal. For example he might 
agree to a weigh-in at a doctor’s office . . . (if the 
goal is to lose weight). If the person reaches his goal, 
he gets his money back. If he fails, the money goes to 
charity.62
A review in 2014 suggests that the most effective ‘stick-
Kers’ are those who publish their goals via the site to a 
group of friends, family or colleagues who can moni-
tor their progress and cheer them on – effectively using 
social norms to reinforce behaviour.63
So, back to that essay. Only twenty hours to go and 
still only 426 words. If only you had written 250 words a 
day for the last ten days, you would be polishing off the 
references and making it look nice by now! So, next time 
you get an assignment, how about you and your mates

 Tasks
	 1	 Discuss and plan an experiment like the ‘circle dragging’ one carried out by Ariely, which you could use to 
see if you find the same differences in motivation resulting from the use of ‘social’ and ‘market’ norms.
	 2	 To what extent should managers appeal to ‘social’ norms when planning the work of their staff? What are 
the benefits and what are the dangers?
	 3	 Consider the idea of ‘priming’. Explain how this might fit into the cycle of perception and behaviour 
illustrated in Figure 6.12. How might a manager, either consciously or unconsciously, ‘prime’ others to 
receive their communications in different ways?
	 4	 What can we learn from the ideas behind the ‘Save More Tomorrow’ scheme or ‘StickK.com’ about how to 
help people to change both their perceptions and behaviour at work in such a way as to improve personal 
effectiveness?

 Some writers argue that people do not lack inherent motivation, only the right triggers to evoke their efforts. Some claim 
that motivation can only come from within and attempts from other people to motivate you have little lasting influence. 
 What are YOUR views? In YOUR own words, what motivates YOU most and to what extent are YOU inﬂ uenced by 
other people? 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Eﬀ ective organisational performance is dependent upon human 
activity and the eﬀ orts of members of staﬀ . The structure of the work 
organisation, styles of leadership and the design and content of jobs can 
have a signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect on the attitude, motivation and satisfaction of 
staﬀ . The manager needs to know how best to elicit the co-operation 
and motivation of staﬀ , and direct their eﬀ orts to achieving the goals and 
objectives of the organisation.

 ●  explain the signiﬁ cance and underlying concept of motivation; 
 ●  detail the various needs and expectations of people at work; 
 ●  examine content theories of motivations and the work of leading writers; 
 ●  review process theories of motivation and relevance to particular work 
situations;

performance. 
 CHAPTER 7 
 Work motivation and job satisfaction 

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
221
The significance of motivation
The relationship between the organisation and its members is influenced by what motivates 
them to work and the rewards and fulfilment they derive from it. The more highly engaged and 
motivated the workforce, the more likely the success of the organisation in achieving its goals 
and objectives. Motivation is at the basis of all organisational activity.
The study of motivation is concerned, basically, with why people behave in a certain way. 
The basic underlying question is ‘Why do people do what they do?’ In general terms, motiva-
tion can be described as the direction and persistence of action. It is concerned with why peo-
ple choose a particular course of action in preference to others, and why they continue with a 
chosen action, often over a long period and in the face of difficulties and problems.1
From a review of motivation theory, Mitchell identifies four common characteristics that 
underlie the definition of motivation:
● Motivation is typified as an individual phenomenon. Every person is unique, and major 
theories of motivation allow for this uniqueness to be demonstrated in one way or another.
● Motivation is described, usually, as intentional. Motivation is assumed to be under the 
worker’s control, and behaviours that are influenced by motivation, such as effort expended, 
are seen as choices of action.
● Motivation is multifaceted. The two factors of greatest importance are: (i) what gets people 
activated (arousal); and (ii) the force of an individual to engage in desired behaviour (direc-
tion or choice of behaviour).
● The purpose of motivational theories is to predict behaviour. Motivation is not the behav-
iour itself and it is not performance. Motivation concerns action and the internal and exter-
nal forces that influence a person’s choice of action.
On the basis of these characteristics, Mitchell defines motivation as ‘the degree to which an 
individual wants and chooses to engage in certain specified behaviours’.2
A fuller definition from the Chartered Management Institute is:
Motivation is the creation of incentives and working environments that enable people to per-
form to the best of their ability. The aim of motivation is to engage people with the work they 
are doing in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for individuals and the organisation 
as a whole.3
Underlying concept of motivation
The underlying concept of motivation is some driving force within individuals by which they 
attempt to achieve some goal in order to fulfil some need or expectation. This concept gives 
rise to the basic motivational model, illustrated in Figure 7.1.
People’s behaviour is determined by what motivates them. Their performance is a product 
of both ability level and motivation:
Performance = function (ability : motivation)
Kreitner et al. suggest that although motivation is a necessary contributor for job perfor-
mance, it is not the only one. Along with ability, motivation is also a combination of level of 
skill, knowledge about how to complete the task, feelings and emotions, and facilitating and 
inhibiting conditions not under the individual’s control.4 However, what is clearly evident is 
that if the manager is to improve the work of the organisation, attention must be given to 
the level of motivation of its members. The manager must also encourage staff to direct their 
efforts (their driving force) towards the successful attainment of the goals and objectives of the 
organisation.

222
Part 2  The individual	
Needs and expectations at work
But what is this driving force and what do people really want from work? What are people’s 
needs and expectations and how do they influence behaviour and performance at work? Moti-
vation is a complex subject, it is a very personal thing and it is influenced by many variables. 
For example, Farren reminds us of the twelve human needs that have been around since the 
beginning of recorded history: family, health and well-being, work/career, economic, learning, 
home/shelter, social relationships, spirituality, community, leisure, mobility and environment/
safety: ‘Work and private life in the new millennium will continue to revolve around the 12 
human needs.’5
Early writers, such as F. W. Taylor, believed in economic needs motivation. Workers would 
be motivated by obtaining the highest possible wages through working in the most efficient 
and productive way. Performance was limited by physiological fatigue. For Taylor, motivation 
was a comparatively simple issue – what the workers wanted from their employers more than 
anything else was high wages. The ideas of F. W. Taylor and his rational–economic concept of 
motivation (discussed in Chapter 3) and subsequent approaches to motivation at work have 
fuelled the continuing debate about financial rewards as a motivator and their influence on 
productivity.
Money as a motivator
Where there is little pleasure in the work itself or the job offers little opportunity for career 
advancement, personal challenge or growth, many people may appear to be motivated primar-
ily, if not exclusively, by money. Weaver suggests that for many hourly workers in the hospital-
ity industry, such as dishwashing, waiting or housekeeping staff, the work does not change 
much among different companies and there is little attachment to a particular company. For 
such staff, Weaver proposes a ‘Theory M’ programme of motivation based on direct cash 
rewards for above-average performance. A percentage base is calculated from the average per-
formance of workers on the staff.6
Different generations in the workforce (discussed in Chapter 3) are also likely to have con-
trasting sets of motivations. For example, baby-boomers may well be concerned primarily 
about security, paying their large mortgages or funding their retirement. Generation X may 
be concerned about the changing nature of the work organisation, their financial future and 
Figure 7.1  A simplified illustration of the basic motivational model

Chapter 7 Work motivation and job satisfaction
223
continuing job security for the rest of their working life. On the other hand, Generation Y may 
be more footloose, have less interest in or doubts about aff ording to buy their own home and 
be less concerned about security or a long-term career. 
 For the vast majority of people, money is clearly important and a motivator at work  but 
to what extent and  how important depends upon personal circumstances and other satis-
factions they derive from work. Although pay may still make people tick, there are now a 
number of other important infl uences on motivation. For many people, the feeling of being 
recognised and valued appears more important than money in motivating them to stay in 
a particular job. Note also that money may seem important as symbolising successful task 
performance and goal achievement.  (See achievement motivation below; see also the ultima-
tum game below.)  
 As  Chamorro-Premuzic and Fagan point out, few management topics have attracted as 
much discussion as the relationship between money and motivation. It seems that money is 
not a great motivator at work, and under certain circumstances may even demotivate. Extrin-
sic incentives such as fi nancial rewards may extinguish or crowd out intrinsic rewards such as 
engagement and job satisfaction. This fi nding has important implications for managers. 
 It suggests that before incentivising their employees with external rewards – money, pro-
motions or titles – they must fi rst work out to what degree the job or task is meaningful or 
interesting for employees. And just as money can compensate for drearier jobs, it may also 
dilute employees’ passion and joy in doing something that they love – like the artist whom is 
off ended by questions about the price of his work. 
 The authors also report on evidence that suggests that people are far more sensitive to the loss 
of money than the gaining of money. A pay rise may not necessarily make people happy, but a 
pay cut will be sure to make them miserable. 7 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 it is all very well talking about a contented workforce, praise and recognition, but at times of recession, rapid change 
or uncertainty, a secure job and high income are the true motivators. in the real world, money is the most potent 
need and strongest motivator. 
 Can YOU argue convincingly against this contention? To what extent are YOU motivated by money? 
 Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation 
 The various needs and expectations at work can be categorised in a number of ways – for 
example, the simple divisions into physiological and social motives or into extrinsic and 
intrinsic motivation. 
 ●  Extrinsic motivation is related to ‘tangible’ rewards such as salary and fringe benefi ts, secu-
rity, promotion, contract of service, the work environment and conditions of work. Such 
tangible rewards are often determined at the organisation level and may be largely outside 
the control of individual managers. 
 ●  Intrinsic motivation  is related to ‘psychological’ rewards such as the opportunity to use 
one’s ability, a sense of challenge and achievement, receiving appreciation, positive recog-
nition and being treated in a caring and considerate manner. The psychological rewards 
are those that can usually be determined by the actions and behaviour of individual 
managers. 8  

224
Part 2  The individual	
According to Sauermann and Cohen, overall intrinsic motives, particularly the desire for 
intellectual challenge, appear to benefit innovation more than extrinsic motives such as pay: 
‘However, management also need to recognise that appealing to individuals’ motives can occa-
sionally detract from organizational goals. For example, there are cases where individuals pur-
sued research projects out of their own interest, against explicit policies of management.’9
Broader intrinsic motivation
Popular press reports appear to indicate that many people are increasingly motivated by 
broader concerns such as their work/life balance (discussed in Chapter 3), opportunities for 
flexible working, career advancement and personal development and growth and a feeling of 
identification with the values of the organisation. The motivation to work is also influenced by 
the changing nature of the work environment and the concept of the ‘psychological contract’ 
(discussed in Chapter 1).
However, according to Gratton, finding intrinsically motivating tasks is not easy.
Finding tasks and experiences that are intrinsically motivating sounds relatively straight 
­forward but in fact it requires a heightened awareness of who we are. Without this emotional 
self-awareness we have no capacity to judge whether the tasks available to us could be intrin-
sically motivating . . . Finding intrinsically motivating tasks also requires the companies of 
which we are members to communicate the tasks available and to encourage volunteering.10
Waller refers to the importance today of identity, and that work inevitably plays a key role 
in shaping identity. Waller questions how much of ourselves we put into our job. He points 
out that, not long ago, a job was something you did to put bread on the table, but nowadays 
(global financial situation apart) people in a cushy job with a decent salary, paid holiday, pen-
sion, healthcare and a well-stocked sandwich trolley will jack it all in, saying ‘It’s not really 
me.’ If people are getting absorbed by their work-life, they expect their job to help them to 
discover and develop themselves.11
According to Kets de Vries, the best-performing companies possess a set of values that cre-
ates the right conditions for high performance. In addition to the motivational needs system 
for physiological needs, sensual and enjoyment needs and the need to respond to threatening 
situations, companies that get the best out of their people are characterised by a system based 
on a higher set of motivational needs:
● attachment/affiliation – concerning the need for engagement and sharing, a feeling of 
community and a sense of belonging to the company; and
● exploration/assertion – concerning the ability to play and work, a sense of fun and enjoy-
ment, the need for self-assertion and the ability to choose.12
Developing a passion for work
Blanchard has identified eight critical employee needs that should be in place if organisations 
are to develop a passion for work and get the best out of their people and have them thrive:
● Meaningful work – People need to know that their work is worthwhile at both the indi-
vidual and organisation levels and this is arguably the most important need.
● Collaboration – Working in a culture and environment that is encouraging, collaborative 
and co-operative.
● Fairness – People expect to be treated with respect, ethically, fairly and justly.
● Autonomy – To have influence and input over how tasks are performed, and freedom to 
make personal decisions about their work.
● Recognition – The feeling they are making a positive contribution through praise and 
appreciation or other recognition for their achievements.
● Growth – The opportunities to learn, grow and develop skills that lead to advancement in 
a chosen career.

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
225
● Connectedness with leaders – People need leaders they can trust and who share information 
and build rapport with them.
● Connectedness with colleagues – Solid relationships with colleagues and co-workers in 
order to provide willingness to apply discretionary effort.13
Threefold classification
Given the complex and variable nature of needs and expectations, the following is a simplistic 
but useful, broad, threefold classification as a starting point for reviewing the motivation to 
work (see Figure 7.2):
● Economic rewards – such as pay, fringe benefits, pension rights, material goods and secu-
rity. This is an instrumental orientation to work and concerned with ‘other things’.
● Intrinsic satisfaction – derived from the nature of the work itself, interest in the job and 
personal growth and development. This is a personal orientation to work and concerned 
with ‘oneself’.
● Social relationships – such as friendships, group working and the desire for affiliation, status 
and dependency. This is a relational orientation to work and concerned with ‘other people’.
A person’s motivation, job satisfaction and work performance will be determined by the com-
parative strength of these sets of needs and expectations and the extent to which they are 
fulfilled. For example, some people may make a deliberate choice to forgo intrinsic satisfaction 
and social relationships in return for high economic rewards and/or job security. For other peo-
ple, psychological well-being or social relationships would appear to be an important feature. 
For people working in caring organisations or the hospitality industry, where pay is often not 
very high, the interactions with other people and importance of supportive working relation-
ships and good teamwork can be strong motivators at work.14
However the needs and expectations at work are categorised, a central motivational issue 
is the underlying importance for management to foster a genuine sense of engagement so 
that employees have a feeling of connection with the organisation and their jobs. (Employee 
engagement is discussed in Chapter 16.)

 Management and organisational behaviour in action case study 
 Happy and productive workplace 
 Henry stewart of the training company Happy draws attention to the positive correlation between staff  engagement 
and profi tability. Employee contentment is an underlying key to maximising growth and performance. key factors to 
a happy workplace include a no-blame culture, a good work/life balance, transparency and a genuine commitment 
to the wider community. applying the ten guiding principles of the Happy manifesto across many organisations has 
created happier and more productive workplaces. 15 
 Ten steps to a happy workplace 
 1.  trust your team. step out of approval. instead, pre-approve and focus on supporting your people. 
 2.  make your people feel good. make this the focus of management. 
 3.  Give freedom within clear guidelines. People want to know what is expected of them. but they want freedom 
to fi nd the best way to achieve their goals. 
 4.  be open and transparent. more information means more people can take responsibility. 
 5.  recruit for attitude, train for skill. instead of qualifi cations and experience, recruit on attitude and potential 
ability. 
 6.  celebrate mistakes. create a truly no-blame culture. 
 7.  community: create mutual benefi t. Have a positive impact on the world and build your organisation too. 
 8.  Love work, get a life. the world, and your job, needs you well rested, well nourished and well supported. 
 9.  select managers who are good at managing. make sure your people are supported by somebody who is good 
at doing that, and fi nd other routes for those whose strengths lie elsewhere. Even better, allow people to choose 
their own managers. 
 10.  Play to your strengths – make sure your people spend most of their time doing what they are best at.

 Tasks 
  1.  to what extent do you accept the contention that employee commitment is an underlying key to maximising 
growth and performance? 
  2.  discuss how you view the relationship between a genuine commitment to the wider community and a happy 
workplace. 
  3.  Explain how  you would place in order of importance the ten steps to a happy workplace. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Given the large number of identified critical employee needs and expectations at work, the threefold classification of 
economic rewards, intrinsic satisfaction and social relationships is far too simplistic as a meaningful focus of analysis. 
 What is YOUR view? What manageable and useful framework of analysis would YOU propose? 
 Theories of motivation 
 There are many competing theories that attempt to explain the nature of motivation. These 
theories may all be at least partially true and help to explain the behaviour of certain peo-
ple at certain times. The complexity of motivation and the lack of a ready-made solution or 
single answer for motivating people at work is what makes the diff erent theories important 
to the manager. They show there are many motives that infl uence people’s behaviour and

performance. Collectively, the different theories provide a framework within which to direct 
attention to the problem of how best to motivate staff to work willingly and effectively.
The usual approach to the study of motivation is through an understanding of internal cog-
nitive processes – that is, what people feel and how they think. This understanding should help 
the manager to predict likely behaviour of staff in given situations. These different cognitive 
theories of motivation are usually divided into two contrasting approaches: content theories 
and process theories.
It is important to emphasise, however, that these various theories are not conclusive. They 
all have their critics (this is particularly true of the content theories of motivation) or have 
been subject to alternative findings. Many of these theories were not intended initially to have 
the significance that some writers have subsequently placed upon them. It is always easy to 
quote an example that appears to contradict any generalised observation on what motivates 
people to work. Despite these reservations, the different theories provide a basis for study and 
discussion, and for review of the most effective motivational style (see Figure 7.3). The man-
ager must judge the relevance of these different theories, how best to draw upon them and how 
they might effectively be applied in particular work situations.
Content theories of motivation
Content theories of motivation attempt to explain those specific things that actually motivate 
the individual at work. These theories are concerned with identifying people’s needs and their 
relative strengths, and the goals they pursue in order to satisfy these needs. Content theories

place emphasis on the nature of needs and what motivates. Major content theories of motiva-
tion include:
● Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory;
● Alderfer’s modified need hierarchy model;
● Nohria’s four-drives model of motivation;
● Herzberg’s two-factor theory;
● McClelland’s achievement motivation theory.
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory
A useful starting point is the work of Maslow and his theory of individual development and 
motivation, published originally in 1943.16 Maslow’s basic proposition is that human needs 
are arranged in a series of levels, a hierarchy of importance. People are wanting beings, they 
always want more, and what they want depends on what they already have.
Huczynski and Buchanan refer to the nine innate needs, including drives and goals, identi-
fied by Maslow (see Figure 7.4). However, the hierarchy is usually shown as ranging through five 
main levels from, at the lowest level, physiological needs, through safety needs, love needs and 
esteem needs, to the need for self-actualisation at the highest level. The ­hierarchy of needs may 
be shown as a series of steps but is usually displayed in the form of a pyramid (see Figure 7.5). 
1 self-actualisation
need to develop our full potential
2 freedom of inquiry and
   expression
need that is a prerequisite for the satisfaction of other needs
3 transcendence
a spiritual need, ‘to be at one with the universe’
4 aesthetics
need for order and beauty
5 to know and to
   understand
need to gain to systematise knowledge, the need for
curiosity, learning, philosophising, experimenting and
exploring
6 esteem
need for strength, confidence, achievement, self-esteem,
independence, reputation, prestige, recognition, attention and
appreciation, and the respect of others
7 affiliation
need for attachment, belongingness, affection, love,
relationships
8 safety
need for security, comfort, tranquillity, freedom from fear and
threat from the environment, shelter, order, predictability and
an organised world
9 biological
need for sunlight, sexual expression, food, water, rest and
oxygen – needs basic to our survival

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
229
This is an appropriate form of illustration as it implies a thinning out of needs as people pro-
gress up the hierarchy:
● Physiological needs – include homeostasis (the body’s automatic efforts to retain normal 
functioning), such as satisfaction of hunger and thirst, the need for oxygen and to maintain 
temperature regulation, and also sleep, sensory pleasures, activity, maternal behaviour and, 
arguably, sexual desire.
● Safety needs – include safety and security, freedom from pain or threat of physical attack, 
protection from danger or deprivation, and the need for predictability and orderliness.
● Love needs (often referred to as social needs) – include affection, sense of belonging, social 
activities, friendships and both the giving and receiving of love.
● Esteem needs (sometimes referred to as ego needs) – include both self-respect and the 
esteem of others. Self-respect involves the desire for confidence, strength, independence and 
freedom, and achievement. Esteem of others involves reputation or prestige, status, recog-
nition, attention and appreciation.
● Self-actualisation needs – once a lower need has been satisfied, it no longer acts as a strong 
motivator. The needs of the next higher level in the hierarchy demand satisfaction and 
become the motivating influence. Only unsatisfied needs motivate a person. Thus Maslow 
asserts that ‘a satisfied need is no longer a motivator’. Maslow claims the hierarchy is rela-
tively universal among different cultures, but recognises there are differences in an indi-
vidual’s motivational content in a particular culture.
Not necessarily a fixed order
Although Maslow suggests that most people have these basic needs in about the order indi-
cated, he makes clear that the hierarchy is not necessarily a fixed order. For some people there 
will be a reversal of the hierarchy, for example:
● Self-esteem may seem to be more important than love to some people. This is the most 
common reversal of the hierarchy. People who seek love may try to put on a show of aggres-
sive, confident behaviour. They are not really seeking self-esteem as an end in itself but for 
the sake of love needs.
● For some innately creative people the drive for creativity and self-actualisation may arise 
despite lack of satisfaction of more basic needs.
● Higher-level needs may be lost in some people who will continue to be satisfied at lower 
levels only, for example a person who has experienced chronic unemployment.
● Some people who have been deprived of love in early childhood may experience the perma-
nent loss of love needs.
Figure 7.5  Maslow’s hierarchy of needs model

230
Part 2  The individual	
● A need satisfied over a long period of time may be undervalued. For example, people who have 
never suffered from chronic hunger may tend to underestimate its effects, and regard food as 
rather unimportant. A higher-level need may assume greater importance than more basic needs.
● People with high ideals or values may become martyrs and give up everything else for the 
sake of their beliefs.
Degrees of satisfaction
Maslow points out that a false impression may be given that a need must be satisfied fully before a 
subsequent need arises. He suggests that a more realistic description is in terms of decreasing per-
centages of satisfaction along levels of the hierarchy. The relative importance of these needs changes 
during the psychological development of the individual. Maslow subsequently modified his views 
by noting that satisfaction of self-actualisation needs by growth-motivated individuals can actually 
enhance these needs rather than reduce them. Furthermore, he accepted that some higher-level needs 
may still emerge after long deprivation of lower-level needs, rather than only after their satisfaction.
Applications to the work situation
Based on Maslow’s theory, once lower-level needs have been satisfied, giving more of the same 
does not provide motivation. Individuals advance up the hierarchy as each lower-level need 
becomes satisfied. Therefore, to provide motivation for a change in behaviour, the manager must 
direct attention to the next higher level of needs that seek satisfaction. However, there are a num-
ber of difficulties in relating Maslow’s theory to the work situation. These include the following:
● People do not necessarily satisfy their needs, especially higher-level needs, just through the 
work situation but through other areas of their life as well. The manager would need a com-
plete understanding of people’s private and social lives, not just their behaviour at work.
● Individual differences mean that people place different values on the same need. For exam-
ple, some people prefer what they see as the comparative safety of working in a bureaucratic 
organisation to a more highly paid and higher-status position, but with less job security, in 
a different organisation.
● Some rewards or outcomes at work satisfy more than one need. Higher salary or promo-
tion, for example, can be applied to all levels of the hierarchy. Even for people within the 
same level of the hierarchy, the motivating factors will not be the same. There are many 
different ways in which people may seek satisfaction of, for example, their esteem needs.
● Maslow viewed satisfaction as the main motivational outcome of behaviour. But job satis-
faction does not necessarily lead to improved work performance.
Useful basis for evaluation
Although Maslow did not originally intend that the need hierarchy should be applied to the work 
situation, it remains popular as a theory of motivation. Despite criticisms and doubts about its 
limitations, the theory has had a significant impact on management approaches to motivation 
and the design of organisations to meet individual needs. It is a convenient framework for view-
ing the different needs and expectations that people have, where they are in the hierarchy and the 
different motivators that might be applied to people at different levels. The need hierarchy model 
provides a useful base for the evaluation of motivation at work. For example, Steers and Porter 
suggest a list of general rewards and organisational factors used to satisfy different needs.17
Saunders contends that, despite the time that has elapsed, Maslow’s theory remains watertight.
When prehistoric man first took shelter in a cave and lit a fire, he was satisfying his lowest – 
physiological and safety – needs. When a Buddhist achieves a state of nirvana, she is satisfying 
the fifth and highest – self-actualisation . . . The cave these days might be a three-bedroom 
semi with garden and off-street parking, but the fact remains that once we’ve got enough to 
feed, clothe and house our families money is a low-level motivator for most people. The dash 
for cash is soon replaced by the desire for recognition, status and ultimately (although Maslow 
reckoned that a lot of us never get this far) the need to express yourself through your work.18

Chapter 7 Work motivation and job satisfaction
231
 Alderfer’s modifi ed need hierarchy model 
 A modifi ed need hierarchy model has been presented by  Alderfer. 20  This model condenses 
Maslow’s fi ve levels of need into only three levels, based on the core needs of existence, relat-
edness and growth (ERG theory): 
 ●  Existence needs are concerned with sustaining human existence and survival and cover 
physiological and safety needs of a material nature. 
 ●  Relatedness needs  are concerned with relationships to the social environment and cover love or 
belonging, affi  liation and meaningful interpersonal relationships of a safety or esteem nature.  
 ●  Growth needs  are concerned with the development of potential and cover self-esteem and 
self-actualisation. 
 A continuum of needs 
 Alderfer suggests that individuals progress through existence needs to relatedness needs to 
growth needs as the lower-level needs become satisfi ed. However, these needs are more a con-
tinuum than hierarchical levels. More than one need may be activated at the same time. Indi-
viduals may also progress down the hierarchy. There is a frustration–regression process. For 
example, if an individual is continually frustrated in attempting to satisfy growth needs, relat-
edness needs may reassume most importance. The lower-level needs become the main focus of 
the individual’s eff orts. 
 Unlike Maslow’s theory, the results of Alderfer’s work suggest that lower-level needs do not 
have to be satisfi ed before a higher-level need emerges as a motivating infl uence. The results, 
however, do support the idea that lower-level needs decrease in strength as they become satis-
fi ed. ERG theory states that an individual is motivated to satisfy one or more basic sets of 
needs. Therefore, if a person’s needs at a particular level are blocked, attention should be 
focused on the satisfaction of needs at the other levels. For example, if a subordinate’s growth 
needs are blocked because the job does not allow suffi  cient opportunity for personal develop-
ment, the manager should attempt to provide greater opportunities for the subordinate to 
satisfy existence and relatedness needs. 
 Nohria’s four-drives model of motivation 
 Another theory similar to Maslow’s is that by  Nohria et al. Based on a survey of a wide range 
of Fortune 500 and other companies, they formulated a model to increase work motivation 
based on four basic innate drives: 
 ●  The drive to  acquire – scarce goods and intangibles such as social status. 
 ●  The drive to  bond – connections with individuals and groups. 
 ●  The drive to  comprehend – satisfy curiosity and master the world around us. 
 ●  The drive to  defend – against external threats and to promote justice. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Adair points out that presenting maslow’s hierarchy as a pyramid model gives the impression that the greatest needs 
are in the lower levels. adair suggests that the pyramid should be inverted as physiological needs, for example, are 
limited but there are fewer limitations the further up you go. 19 
 How would YOU best explain and present Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs? 

232
Part 2  The individual	
For each of these drives there is a primary organisational lever that front-line managers can 
use in order to best meet these deep needs and drives. Reward systems that value good perfor-
mance fulfil the drive to acquire. A collaborative and open culture fulfils the drive to bond. 
Meaningful and challenging jobs fulfil the need to comprehend. Transparent performance 
management systems fulfil the drive to defend. All four levers are important, and failure to 
fulfil any one drive adequately will impact on the satisfaction of other drives. However, using 
all four levers simultaneously can lead to a noticeable increase in motivation.21
Herzberg’s two-factor theory
The link between motivation, job design and satisfaction was established by Herzberg et al., 
who used a critical incident method in interviews with 203 accountants and engineers from 
different industries in the Pittsburgh area of the USA. Subjects were asked to describe times 
when they felt exceptionally good or exceptionally bad about their present job or any previous 
job. Responses to the interviews were generally consistent and revealed that there were two 
different sets of factors affecting motivation and work. This led to the two-factor theory of 
motivation and job satisfaction.22
Hygiene and motivating factors
One set of factors is those that, if absent, cause dissatisfaction. These factors are related 
to job context; they are concerned with job environment and are extrinsic to the job itself. 
They are the hygiene or maintenance factors (‘hygiene’ being used as analogous to the medi-
cal term meaning preventive and environmental). The other set of factors is those that serve 
to motivate the individual to superior effort and performance. These factors are related 
to job content of the work itself. They are the motivators or growth factors. The strength 
of these factors will affect feelings of satisfaction or no satisfaction, but not dissatisfac-
tion. The opposite of dissatisfaction is not satisfaction but, simply, no dissatisfaction (see 
Figure 7.6).
Herzberg emphasises that hygiene factors are not a ‘second-class citizen system’. They are 
as important as the motivators, but for different reasons. Hygiene factors are necessary to 
avoid unpleasantness at work and to deny unfair treatment: ‘Management should never deny 
people proper treatment at work.’ To motivate workers to give of their best, the manager must 
give proper attention to the motivators or growth factors. The motivators relate to what peo-
ple are allowed to do and the quality of human experience at work. They are the variables that 
actually motivate people.
Evaluation of Herzberg’s work
Herzberg’s theory is a source of frequent debate. There are two common general criti-
cisms of his theory. One is that the theory has only limited application to people in largely 
unskilled jobs or whose work is uninteresting, repetitive and monotonous, and limited in 
scope. Yet these are the people who often present management with the biggest problem of 
motivation. Some workers do not seem greatly interested in the job content of their work or 
with the motivators or growth factors. A second, general criticism concerns the critical inci-
dent methodology. People are more likely to attribute satisfying incidents at work, that is, the 
motivators, as a favourable reflection on their own performance. The dissatisfying incidents, 
the hygiene factors, are more likely to be attributed to external influences and the efforts of 
other people.

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
233
Despite such criticisms, there is still evidence of support for the continuing relevance of the 
theory. For example, according to Crainer and Dearlove:
Herzberg’s work has had a considerable effect on the rewards and remuneration packages offered 
by corporations. Increasingly, there is a trend towards ‘cafeteria’ benefits in which people can 
choose from a range of options. In effect, they can select the elements they recognise as providing 
their own motivation to work. Similarly, the current emphasis on self-development, career man-
agement and self-managed learning can be seen as having evolved from Herzberg’s insights.23
Whatever the validity of the two-factor theory, much of the criticism is with the benefit of 
hindsight, and Herzberg did at least attempt an empirical approach to the study of motivation 
at work and job satisfaction. Furthermore, his work has drawn attention to the importance of 
job design in the ‘quality of work-life’. The work of Herzberg indicates it is more likely that 
good performance leads to job satisfaction rather than the reverse.

Part 2  The individual	
McClelland’s achievement motivation theory
McClelland’s work originated from investigations into the relationship between hunger needs 
and the extent to which imagery of food dominated thought processes. From subsequent 
research McClelland identified four main arousal-based, and socially developed, motives:
● the achievement motive;
● the power motive;
● the affiliative motive;
● the avoidance motive.24
The relative intensity of these motives varies between individuals. It also tends to vary between 
different occupations. Managers appear to be higher in achievement motivation than in affili-
ation motivation. McClelland saw the achievement need (n-Ach) as the most critical for the 
country’s economic growth and success. The need to achieve is linked to entrepreneurial spirit 
and the development of available resources.
Research studies by McClelland use a series of projective ‘tests’ – Thematic Apperception 
Tests (TATs) – to gauge an individual’s motivation. Individuals are shown a number of pic-
tures in which some activity is depicted. They are asked to look briefly (10–15 seconds) at the 
pictures and then describe what they think is happening, what people in the picture are think-
ing and what events have led to the situation depicted.25 The descriptions are used as a basis 
for analysing the strength of the individual’s motives.
Characteristics of achievement motivation
Some individuals rate very highly in achievement motivation. They are challenged by opportu-
nities and work hard to achieve a goal. Money is not an incentive but may serve as a means of 
giving feedback on performance. High achievers seem unlikely to remain long with an organi-
sation that does not pay them well for good performance. Money may seem to be important 
to high achievers, but they value it more as symbolising successful task performance and goal 
achievement.
From empirical research McClelland identified four characteristics of people with a strong 
achievement need (n-Ach):
● Moderate task difficulty and goals as an achievement incentive. If the task is too difficult 
or too risky, it would reduce chances of success and gaining need satisfaction. If the course 
of action is too easy or too safe, there is little challenge in accomplishing the task and little 
satisfaction from success.
● Personal responsibility for performance. They like to attain success through the focus of 
their own abilities and efforts rather than by teamwork or chance factors outside their con-
trol. Personal satisfaction is derived from the accomplishment of the task and recognition 
need not come from other people.
● Need for clear and unambiguous feedback on how well they are performing. A knowledge 
of results within a reasonable time is necessary for self-evaluation. Feedback enables them 
to determine success or failure in the accomplishment of their goals and to derive satisfac-
tion from their activities.
● More innovative. As they always seek moderately challenging tasks, they tend always to be 
moving on to something a little more challenging. In seeking shortcuts they are more likely 
to cheat. There is a constant search for variety and for information to find new ways of 
doing things. They are more restless, avoid routine and also tend to travel more.
McClelland and Burnham have also suggested that as effective managers need to be suc-
cessful leaders and to influence other people, they should possess a high need for power.26 

Chapter 7 Work motivation and job satisfaction
235
 Process theories of motivation 
 Process theories of motivation, or extrinsic theories, attempt to identify the relationships 
among the dynamic variables that make up motivation and the actions required to infl uence 
behaviour and actions. These theories are concerned more with the actual process of moti-
vation and how behaviour is initiated, directed and sustained. Many of the theories cannot 
be linked to a single writer, but major approaches and leading writers under this heading 
include: 
 ●  expectancy-based models – Vroom, and Porter and Lawler; 
 ●  equity theory – Adams; 
 ●  goal theory – Locke; 
 ●  attribution theory – Heider and Kelley  (discussed in  Chapter  6 ). 
 Expectancy theories of motivation 
 The underlying basis of  expectancy theory is that people are infl uenced by the expected results 
of their actions. Motivation is a function of the relationship between: 
  1.  eff ort expended and perceived level of performance; and 
  2.  the expectation that rewards (desired outcomes) will be related to performance. 
 There must also be: 
  3.  the expectation that rewards (desired outcomes) are available. 
 These relationships determine the strength of the ‘motivational link’ ( see  Figure  7.7 ). Perfor-
mance depends upon the perceived expectation regarding eff ort expended and achieving the 
desired outcome. For example, the desire for promotion will result in high performance only 
if the person believes there is a strong possibility this will lead to promotion. If, however, the 
person believes promotion to be based solely on age and length of service, there is no motiva-
tion to achieve high performance. A person’s behaviour refl ects a conscious choice between 
the comparative evaluation of alternative behaviours.  The choice of behaviour is based on the 
expectancy of the most favourable consequences. 
 More recent approaches to expectancy theory have been associated with the work of Vroom 
and of Porter and Lawler. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 the difficulty with the theory of achievement motivation is that far too few organisations provide the culture or 
opportunities for individuals to satisfy the characteristics of high achievement needs. 
 To what extent do YOU believe this is fair comment? How would YOU describe the extent of YOUR own need for 
achievement? 
However, the eff ective manager also scores high on inhibition. Power is directed more towards 
the organisation and concern for group goals and is exercised on behalf of other people. This 
is ‘socialised’ power. It is distinguished from ‘personalised’ power, which is characterised by 
satisfaction from exercising dominance over other people, and personal aggrandisement. 

236
Part 2  The individual	
Vroom’s expectancy theory
Vroom was the first person to propose an expectancy theory aimed specifically at work moti-
vation.27 His model is based on three key variables: valence, instrumentality and expectancy 
(VIE theory or expectancy/valence theory). The theory is founded on the idea that people pre-
fer certain outcomes from their behaviour over others. They anticipate feelings of satisfaction 
should the preferred outcome be achieved.
● Valence – the term used for the feeling about specific outcomes. This is the attractiveness of, 
or preference for, a particular outcome to the individual. It is the anticipated satisfaction 
from an outcome. The valences of certain outcomes may be derived in their own right, but 
more usually are derived from other outcomes to which they are expected to lead. An obvi-
ous example is money. Some people may see money as having an intrinsic worth and derive 
satisfaction from the actual accumulation of wealth. Most people, however, see money in 
terms of the many satisfying outcomes to which it can lead.
● Instrumentality – from which the valences of outcomes are derived. This leads to a distinc-
tion between first-level outcomes and second-level outcomes. The first-level outcomes are 
performance related. Some people may seek to perform well as part of their work ethic and 
without thinking about the expected consequences of their actions. Usually, however, per-
formance outcomes acquire valence because of the expectation that they will lead to other 
outcomes as an anticipated source of satisfaction – second-level outcomes. The second-
level outcomes are need related. Many need-related outcomes are dependent upon actual 
performance rather than effort expended. People generally receive rewards for what they 
have achieved rather than for effort alone or through trying hard. On the basis of Vroom’s 
expectancy theory it is possible to depict a general model of behaviour (see Figure 7.8).
● Expectancy – when a person chooses between alternative behaviours that have uncertain 
outcomes, the choice is affected not only by the preference for a particular outcome but also 
by the probability that the outcome will be achieved. This is expectancy. People develop a 
perception of the degree of probability that the choice of a particular action will actually 
lead to the desired outcome. Expectancy relates effort expended to the achievement of first-
level outcomes. Its value ranges between 0, indicating zero probability, and 1, indicating 
certainty that an action will result in the outcome.
Motivational force
The combination of valence and expectancy determines the person’s motivation for a given 
form of behaviour. This is the motivational force. Expressed as an equation, motivation (M) is 
the sum of the products of the valences of all outcomes (V) times the strength of expectancies 
Figure 7.7  Expectancy theory: the motivational link
 

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
237
that action will result in achieving these outcomes (E). Therefore, if either, or both, valence 
or expectancy is zero, then motivation is zero. The choice between alternative behaviours is 
indicated by the highest attractiveness score.
M = a
n
E # V
There are likely to be a number of outcomes expected for a given action. Therefore, the meas-
ure of E•V is summed across the total number of possible outcomes to arrive at a single figure 
indicating the attractiveness for the contemplated choice of behaviour.
The Porter and Lawler expectancy model
Vroom’s expectancy/valence theory has been developed and expanded by Porter and Lawler.28 
Their model goes beyond motivational force and considers performance as a whole. They 
point out that effort expended (motivational force) does not lead directly to performance. It 
is mediated by individual abilities and traits, and by the person’s role perceptions. Porter and 
Lawler also introduce both intrinsic rewards and extrinsic rewards as intervening influences 
with feedback to perceived effort–reward probability. Perceived equitable rewards is also an 
influence on the level of satisfaction.
Explanation of relationships
Porter and Lawler see motivation, satisfaction and performance as separate variables and 
attempt to explain the complex relationships among them. In contrast to the human relations 
approach, which tended to assume that job satisfaction leads to improved performance, Porter 
and Lawler suggest that satisfaction is an effect rather than a cause of performance. It is per-
formance that leads to job satisfaction.
● Value of reward is similar to valence in Vroom’s model. People desire various outcomes 
(rewards), which they hope to achieve from work. The value placed on a reward depends on 
the strength of its desirability.
Figure 7.8  Basic model of expectancy theory

Part 2  The individual	
● Perceived effort–reward probability is similar to expectancy. It refers to a person’s expecta-
tion that certain outcomes (rewards) are dependent upon a given amount of effort.
● Effort is the amount of energy exerted on a given activity. This is dependent upon the 
interaction of the input variables of value of reward and perception of the effort–reward 
relationship.
● Abilities and traits suggests that effort does not lead directly to performance but is influ-
enced by individual characteristics such as intelligence, skills, knowledge, training and 
personality.
● Role perceptions refers to the way individuals view their work and the role they should 
adopt. Role perceptions will influence the direction and level of action believed to be neces-
sary for effective performance.
● Performance depends not only on the amount of effort exerted, but also on the intervening 
influences of the person’s abilities and traits, and their role perceptions. Lack of the right 
ability or an inaccurate role perception of what is required may result in a low level of per-
formance or task accomplishment, despite exertion of a large amount of energy.
● Rewards are desirable outcomes. Intrinsic rewards derive from the individuals themselves 
and include a sense of achievement, a feeling of responsibility and recognition (e.g. Herz-
berg’s motivators). Extrinsic rewards derive from the organisation and the actions of others 
and include salary, working conditions and supervision (e.g. Herzberg’s hygiene factors). 
The extent of the relationship depends upon the nature of the job and the extent to which 
it permits variety and challenge, so that people feel able to reward themselves for good 
performance. 
● Perceived equitable rewards – most people have an implicit perception about the level of 
rewards they should receive commensurate with the requirements and demands of the job. 
Self-rating of performance links directly with the perceived equitable reward variable.
● Satisfaction is not the same as motivation. It is an attitude, an individual’s internal state. Sat-
isfaction is determined by both actual rewards received and perceived level of rewards from 
the organisation for a given standard of performance. The experience of satisfaction derives 
from actual rewards that meet or exceed the perceived equitable rewards.
Lawler’s revised expectancy model
Following the original Porter and Lawler model, further work was undertaken by Lawler (see 
Figure 7.9).29 He suggests that in deciding the attractiveness of alternative behaviours, there 
are two types of expectancies to be considered: effort–performance expectancies (E S P) and 
performance–outcome expectancies (P S O).
The first expectancy (E S P) is the person’s perception of the probability that a given 
amount of effort will result in achieving an intended level of performance. It is measured on a 
scale between 0 and 1. The closer the perceived relationship between effort and performance, 
the higher the E S P expectancy score.
The second expectancy (P S O) is the person’s perception of the probability that a given 
level of performance will actually lead to particular need-related outcomes. This is measured 
also on a scale between 0 and 1. The closer the perceived relationship between performance 
and outcome, the higher the P S O expectancy score.
Motivational force to perform
The multiplicative combination of the two types of expectancies, E S P and the sum of the 
products P S O, determines expectancy. The motivational force to perform (effort expended) 
is determined by multiplying E S P and P S O by the strength of outcome valence (V):
E1Effort2 = 1E S P2 * a 31P S O2V4

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
239
The distinction between the two types of expectancies arises because they are determined by 
different conditions. E S P expectancy is determined in part by the person’s ability and self-
confidence, past experience and the difficulty of the task. P S O expectancy is determined by 
the attractiveness of the outcomes and the belief about who controls the outcomes – the actual 
person or other people.
Implications of expectancy theories
There are a number of versions of expectancy theory. The main elements tend to be very 
similar, however, and this suggests the development of a generally accepted approach. 
Expectancy models are not always easy to understand, or to apply. There are many vari-
ables that affect behaviour at work. A problem can arise in attempting to include a large 
number of variables or in identifying those variables that are most appropriate in particu-
lar situations.
Expectancy theory does, however, draw attention to the complexities of work motiva-
tion. It provides further information in helping to explain the nature of behaviour and moti-
vation in the work situation, and helps to identify problems in performance. Expectancy 
theory indicates that managers should give attention to a number of factors, including the 
following:
● Use rewards appropriate in terms of individual performance. Outcomes with high valence 
should be used as an incentive for improved performance.
● Attempt to establish clear relationships between effort–performance and rewards, as per-
ceived by the individual.
● Establish clear procedures for the evaluation of individual levels of performance.
Figure 7.9  An illustration of the Lawler expectancy model

240
part 2 tHE individUaL 
 ●  Pay attention to intervening variables such as abilities and traits, role perceptions, organi-
sational procedures and support facilities, which, although not necessarily direct motiva-
tional factors, may still aff ect performance. 
 ●  Minimise undesirable outcomes that may be perceived to result from a high level of per-
formance, such as industrial accidents or sanctions from co-workers, or to result despite a 
high level of performance, such as short-time working or layoff s. 
 Porter and Lawler also emphasise that the expectancy model is just a model and that expec-
tancy theory applies only to behaviours that are under the voluntary control of the individual. 
The two general types of choices over which individuals have voluntary control of work per-
formance in organisations are the amount of eff ort and energy expended, and the manner in 
which they go about performing their work. 
  There is always a choice about the way you do your work, even if there is not a choice about 
the work itself. You always have a choice about the attitude you bring to the job.

 Strategic and total rewards 
 The value of rewards is an important aspect of expectancy theories of motivation. The CIPD 
distinguishes between  strategic rewards and  total rewards. 
 Strategic reward is based on the design and implementation of long-term policies and 
practices to closely support and advance business or organisational objectives as well as 
employee aspirations. The concept of  total reward encompasses all aspects of work that 
are valued by employees, including elements such as learning and development opportuni-
ties and/or an attractive working environment, in addition to the wider pay and benefi ts 
package. 31  
 The need to maintain the motivation, development and performance of employees has resulted 
in many organisations giving greater attention to a more comprehensive approach of total 
rewards, including attention to both extrinsic and intrinsic rewards  (discussed above). 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Expectancy theories of motivation may make for interesting discussion in the classroom but are unlikely to have 
much appeal to the practical manager in modern work organisations. 
 What do YOU think? How would YOU justify the potential benefits of expectancy theory to a sceptical manager? 
  Equity theory of motivation 
 One of the major variables of satisfaction in the Porter and Lawler expectancy model is per-
ceived equitable rewards. This leads to consideration of another process theory of motivation – 
 equity theory. Applied to the work situation, equity theory is usually associated with the work 
of  Adams. 32  
 Equity theory focuses on people’s feelings of how fairly they have been treated in com-
parison with the treatment received by others. It is based on social exchange theory  (discussed 
in  Chapter  1 ). Social relationships involve an exchange process. For example, a person may 

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
241
expect promotion as an outcome of a high level of contribution (input) in helping to achieve 
an important organisational objective. People also compare their own position with that of 
others. They determine the perceived equity of their own position. Most exchanges involve a 
number of inputs and outcomes. According to equity theory, people place a weighting on these 
various inputs and outcomes according to how they perceive their importance. When there is 
an unequal comparison of ratios the person experiences a sense of inequity.
Behaviour as a consequence of inequity
A feeling of inequity causes tension, which is an unpleasant experience. The presence of ineq-
uity therefore motivates the person to remove or to reduce the level of tension and the perceived 
inequity. The magnitude of perceived inequity determines the level of tension and strength of 
motivation. Adams identifies six broad types of possible behaviour as consequences of ineq-
uity (see Figure 7.10):
● Changes to inputs – Increasing or decreasing level of inputs, for example through the 
amount or quality of work, absenteeism, or working additional hours without pay.
● Changes to outcomes – Attempting to change outcomes such as pay, working conditions, 
status and recognition, without changes to inputs.
● Cognitive distortion – Distorting, cognitively, inputs or outcomes to achieve the same 
results. Attempting to distort the utility of facts, for example the belief about how hard 
they are really working, the relevance of a particular qualification, or what they can or can-
not obtain with a given level of pay.
● Leaving the field – Trying to find a new situation with a more favourable balance, for exam-
ple by absenteeism, request for a transfer, resigning from a job or from the organisation 
altogether.
Figure 7.10  An illustration of Adams’ equity theory of motivation

242
Part 2  The individual	
● Acting on others – Attempting to bring about changes in others, for example to lower their 
inputs or accept greater outcomes. The person may cognitively distort the inputs and out-
comes of others, or alternatively try to force others to leave the field.
● Changing the object of comparison – Changing the reference group with whom comparison 
is made. For example, where another person with a previously similar ratio of outcomes–
inputs receives greater outcomes without any apparent increase in contribution, that other 
person may be perceived as now belonging to a different level in the organisation structure.
Under the control of the manager
The manager may seek to remove or reduce tension and perceived inequity among staff 
by influencing these types of behaviour – for example, by attempting to change a person’s 
inputs or encouraging a different object of comparison. People measure and compare their 
total inputs and outcomes, so, for example, a working parent may prefer greater flexibility in 
working hours in return for lower monetary rewards. However, there are likely to be only two 
courses of action under the direct control of the manager. Outcomes can be changed by, for 
example, increased pay, additional perks or improved working conditions; or by instigating a 
person leaving the field through transfer, resignation or, as an extreme measure, dismissal. It is 
important to remember that equity theory is about the perceived ratio of inputs to outcomes 
and these perceptions may not reflect the reality of the situation.
The ultimatum game
The ultimatum game is an economic behavioural game that can arguably be related to the con-
cept of equity theory.33 Two participants, A and B, are given the opportunity to split a given sum 
of money between them. The game is played anonymously and once only. One person (A) has to 
decide to make a one-time, take-it-or-leave-it offer (ultimatum) to the other person (B). If person 
B agrees to the division, both A and B keep their share of the money. However, if the offer is 
rejected then neither person receives anything. Experiments indicate that if A offers around 50 per 
cent of the money then B will accept the offer. But if A offers a noticeably lesser amount than 50 
per cent, B will typically refuse the offer in which case neither participant receives anything. One 
might expect B to accept because even a lesser amount, whatever the offer, is better than nothing.
The conclusion appears to be that people do not like to be taken advantage of, and in cer-
tain circumstances at work, fairness in treatment is more important than money. Can you see 
how this might be related to perceptions of equity theory?
Viewers of the ITV1 television quiz programme Divided, in which contestants have to agree 
how to divide a cash prize, may see a similarity with the ultimatum game.
Goal theory
Another theory usually considered under the heading of motivation to work is goal theory, 
or the theory of goal-setting (see Figure 7.11). This theory is based mainly on the work of 
Locke.34 The basic premise is that people’s goals or intentions play an important part in deter-
mining behaviour. Locke accepts the importance of perceived value, as indicated in expectancy 
theories of motivation, and suggests that these values give rise to the experience of emotions 
and desires. Goals direct work behaviour and performance and lead to certain consequences 
or feedback. People strive to achieve goals in order to satisfy their emotions and desires. Locke 
subsequently pointed out that ‘goal-setting is more appropriately viewed as a motivational 
technique rather than as a formal theory of motivation’.35
Goal-setting and performance
The combination of goal difficulty – the extent to which it is challenging and demanding – 
and the extent of the person’s commitment regulates the level of effort expended. People 
with specific quantitative goals, such as a defined level of performance or a given deadline for 

Chapter 7 Work motivation and job satisfaction
243
completion of a task, will perform better than people with no set goal or only a vague goal 
such as ‘do the best you can’. People who have diffi  cult goals will perform better than people 
with easier goals. 
 Gratton  refers to ‘stretch goals’, which are ambitious, highly targeted opportunities for 
breakthrough improvements in performance. These goals should stem from critical success 
indicators and come from deep discussions within the company, and from collaboration 
within and across task forces, and lead to the development of activities and tactics to achieve 
the goals. 36 People lacking positive motivation at work may also help gain improved results and 
a better sense of achievement by setting themselves specifi c goals and identifying tasks directly 
related to their work and measurable targets of time and performance. 
 Practical implications for the manager 
 Goal theory has a number of practical implications for the manager: 
 ●  Individuals lacking in motivation often do not have clear goals. Specifi c performance 
goals should systematically be identifi ed and set in order to direct behaviour and maintain 
motivation. 
 ●  Goals should be set at a challenging but realistic level. Diffi  cult goals lead to higher perfor-
mance. However, if goals are set at too high a level or are regarded as impossible to achieve, 
this can lead to stress and performance will suff er, especially over a longer period. 
 ●  Complete, accurate and timely feedback and knowledge of results is usually associated 
with high performance. Feedback provides a means of checking progress on goal attain-
ment and forms the basis for any revision of goals. 
 ●  Goals can be determined either by a superior or by individuals themselves. Goals set by 
other people are more likely to be accepted when there is participation. Employee partici-
pation in the setting of goals may lead to higher performance. 
 However it is viewed, the theory of goal-setting provides a useful approach to work motivation 
and performance. And  Hannagan goes so far as to suggest: ‘At present goal-setting is one of 
the most infl uential theories of work motivation applicable to all cultures.’ 37

 the underlying essence of motivating employees to improved performance is easy. an emphasis on clear, stretching 
but attainable targets; constructive feedback; and an equitable system of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. 
 What is YOUR critical view of this assertion? How would YOU explain the underlying essence of work motivation?

245
Attribution theory
A more recent approach to the study of motivation is attribution theory. Attribution is the 
process by which people interpret the perceived causes of behaviour. Attribution theory was 
discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
Relevance today
Given that most major theories of motivation date back many years, it is inevitable that ques-
tions are raised about their relevance today. The Chartered Management Institute suggests that 
looking at both theories and real-life examples of motivation should stimulate your thoughts, 
and give you some ‘starter’ ideas on how to motivate your own people.38
Whatever the relevance of the different theories of motivation, to what extent do individu-
als have control over their own level of motivation or how much is dependent upon the lead-
ership they encounter? Adair reassesses the theories of Maslow and Herzberg in terms of 
action-centred leadership (discussed in Chapter 9). Adair also argues that the extent to which 
you can motivate anyone else is limited and refers to the fifty–fifty rule of motivation, that is:
Fifty percent of motivation comes from within a person and 50% from his or her environment, 
especially from the leadership encountered there. The fifty-fifty rule in motivation does not 
claim to identify the different proportions in the equation exactly. It is more like a rough and 
ready rule of thumb. In effect it says no more than a substantial part of motivation lies with a 
person while a substantial part lies, so to speak, outside and beyond control.39
Cross-cultural dimensions of motivation
Whatever the popularity of different theories of motivation, doubts are raised about their 
universality on the ground that they have not adequately addressed the factor of culture.40 Are 
theories of motivation universally applicable or are there meaningful differences in motivation 
at work, or in life more generally, in different societies? A number of writers have questioned 
whether motivational theories and models originating in one culture are amenable to transfer-
ence to other parts of the world. For example, Francesco and Gold devote a substantial pro-
portion of a discussion of motivation to examining the extent to which American motivation 
theories are applicable outside the USA.41
One criticism of content theories of motivation centres on its relative applicability in differ-
ent circumstances, and the suggestion that there may be variations across cultures falls within 
this line of reasoning. However, perhaps less obviously, process theories of motivation have 
also been criticised for being culture-bound. As they focus on process rather than content, 
such theories may appear to be more applicable in diverse cultural contexts. Nonetheless it has 
been suggested that process theories of motivation contain certain inbuilt assumptions that 
are themselves culturally derived.
Adler reminds us that expectancy models of motivation assume that individuals believe that 
they can, to some extent, control their environment and influence their fate. If, as in the cases 
of more fatalistic cultures such as China, people do not have the same sense of internal attribu-
tion, the expectancy model may have less force and therefore less applicability. When Adams’ 
equity theory is applied across the world, differences in interpretation have been recorded.42
Organisational behaviour modification
Another possible approach to motivation is that of organisational behaviour modification 
(OBMod). This is the application of learning principles to influence organisational behaviour. 
In particular it can be seen as a form of Skinner’s operant conditioning, or reinforcement 

246
Part 2  The individual	
theory (discussed in Chapter 5). Reinforcement is a feature of the behaviourism approach and 
is shaped by environmental influences. The reward for a particular form of behaviour is likely 
to result in the reinforcement of that behaviour. A negative outcome or lack of acknowledge-
ment for the behaviour is likely to mean that the behaviour will stop. Luthans and Kreitner 
suggest that OBMod ‘represents a merging of behavioral learning theory on the one hand and 
organizational behavior theory on the other’.43
According to Luthans and Kreitner, a major premise of OBMod is that positive conse-
quence management is much more effective than negative consequence management. Organi-
sations that encourage the members to learn and undertake desired behaviours and not to 
undertake undesired behaviours follow five main steps:
	1.	 Identify the observable, objective and measurable behaviours relevant to the desired organ-
isational performance.
	2.	 Measure the frequency with which those behaviours actually occur under normal condi-
tions. Provide baseline performance data as a point of reference to compare with changes 
in step 5.
	3.	 Determine the antecedents of the behaviours, the reinforcements to encourage patterns of 
behaviour and the consequences that follow from those behaviours.
	4.	 Develop an intervention strategy for change in order to strengthen desirable behaviours 
and weaken undesirable behaviours, through the use of operant conditioning and rein-
forcement theory including punishment if necessary.
	5.	 Measure and evaluate systematically (using the same measure as in step 2) the extent to 
which the frequencies of desired behaviours and undesired behaviours have changed, and 
improvements in organisational performance.
Applications of OBMod
To what extent can OBMod be applied effectively to improve motivation and performance in 
work organisations? OBMod works best for behaviours that are specific, objective and count-
able. There have been a number of studies in the USA that indicate positive results in behav-
iours that improved performance in reducing errors, attendance and punctuality, health and 
safety and customer service.44
In a study of a Russian textile factory, following the OBMod approach, workers were 
subjected to two forms of intervention – extrinsic rewards and social rewards. The extrinsic 
rewards provided valued American products, such as clothing, music tapes and hard-to-get 
foods, for improved performance. Social rewards such as attention, recognition and praise 
from supervisors were for performing specified actions such as checking looms, undertaking 
repairs and helping others.
Both the extrinsic and social interventions led to highly significant increases in perfor-
mance. This contrasted with a previous participative job design approach that involved asking 
workers for ideas for improving performance and enriching their jobs that did not work. The 
researchers suggest cultural issues and the workers’ past experiences may explain the failure of 
the participative intervention strategy, and that the OBMod approach has wider application.45
Although there appear to be a number of supporters in the USA, in the UK it is a controver-
sial concept. Critics claim that OBMod is not an accepted theory of motivation and that there 
are too many individual differences for people to be treated as subjects of operant condition-
ing. OBMod is concerned only with shaping. There is the added criticism of a ‘Big Brother’ 
approach with excessive management manipulation and control over employees, more in line 
with scientific management (recall the discussion in Chapter 2). This in turn could also have 
the added disadvantage of discouraging individual initiative and adaptability to change cir-
cumstances. Workers subject to OBMod programmes may tend to ignore those aspects of 
voluntary behaviours, such as social support or assistance to colleagues, that are not subject to 
direct reward and reinforcement.

Motivation of knowledge workers
Recent advantages in telecommunications and in scientific and technological knowledge have 
led to greater emphasis on the knowledge and expertise of staff and the importance of creativ-
ity. Tampoe suggests that at the core of the new industrial trend are the ‘knowledge workers’ – 
those employees who apply their theoretical and practical understanding of a specific area of 
knowledge to produce outcomes of a commercial, social or personal value. The performance 
of knowledge workers should be judged on both the cleverness of ideas and the utility and 
commercial value of their applied knowledge. Creativity is necessary and needs to be encour-
aged, but should be bounded by commercial realism. This presents management with a new 
challenge of how to motivate the knowledge workers.46
Tampoe suggests that the personal motivation of knowledge workers is based on the value 
they place on the rewards they expect to earn at work. In addition to the individual’s own 
motivation, the performance of knowledge workers is dependent upon four key characteristics 
(see Figure 7.13):
● task competence;
● peer and management support;
● task and role clarity; and
● corporate awareness.
The challenge to management is to ensure the effectiveness of the four key variables and to rec-
ognise the need for staff to supervise and manage themselves and the wider rewards expected 
by knowledge workers.
Climate of creativity
Whitmore suggests that in order to create a climate for creativity among employees, recogni-
tion must be given to the importance of two human needs that rise above all others and exist 
independent of race, creed and culture: the need for self-belief and the development of emo-
tional intelligence; and the ever-present need that every human being has for a sense of mean-
ing and purpose in their lives.

 Self-belief and meaningful work are the fundamental bedrocks that underlie business 
performance. Of course, pay and conditions are important too, but we know that. It is 
these two others that are barely recognised . . . but business leaders ignore them at 
their peril. 47  
 Matson and Prusak of management consultants McKinsey & Company report that despite 
the high stakes in knowledge workers, there is a lack of understanding of what it takes to 
bolster their productivity. This lack of clarity is partly because knowledge work involves more 
diverse and amorphous tasks than do production or clerical positions, and partly because per-
formance metrics are hard to come by in knowledge work. Knowledge workers spend half their 
time on interactions and, in order to improve their productivity, companies should explore the 
barriers that impede these interactions: 
 ●  Physical and technical – including geographical distance, diff erent time zones or lack of 
eff ective tools. 
 ●  Social or cultural – including rigid hierarchies or ineff ective incentives. 
 ●  Contextual – the sharing of and translating knowledge from colleagues in diff erent fi elds. 
 ●  Time – or rather the perceived lack of time. 48 
 Goﬀ ee and Jones suggest that future prosperity rests with organisations that make their living 
from the knowledge they themselves are able to develop. Clever people are highly talented indi-
viduals with the potential to create disproportionate amounts of value from the resources that 
the organisation makes available to them. Keeping and leading the clever people who inhabit 
these organisations becomes a critical challenge. 
 Exceptionally sharp and creative executives often come with characteristics that make them 
hard to handle. They can be egotistical, disdainful of hierarchies and prone to asking awk-
ward questions . . . Yet research has repeatedly demonstrated that creativity and innovation 
are inextricably linked to energy, edge and fun, which organisational attrition is in danger of 
crushing. 
 Clever people do not like to be led or told what to do and are at their most productive when 
faced with really hard questions. Tell them something is not possible and they will be highly 
motivated to prove you wrong. They must be given enough space to try out new things and 
given recognition for their work. Goff ee and Jones suggest that clever people can be diffi  cult to 
lead and have developed new rules to help guide their leaders. 49  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 the motivation of so-called knowledge workers is no different from motivating any other worker – that is, recogni-
tion of their individual value to achieving the objectives of the organisation. 
 What do YOU think? How far do YOU agree with the characteristics of clever people? Do you see YOURSELF as a 
potential knowledge worker? 
 Frustration-induced behaviour 
 What happens if a person’s motivational driving force is blocked and they are unable to satisfy 
their needs and expectations, and what is the likely eff ect on their work performance? There 
are two possible sets of outcomes: constructive behaviour or frustration ( see  Figure  7.14 ). 
  Constructive behaviour  is a positive reaction to the blockage of a desired goal and can take 
two main forms: problem-solving or restructuring. 

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
249
● Problem-solving is the removal of the barrier – for example, finding an alternative means of 
undertaking a task, repairing a damaged machine or bypassing a non co-operative superior.
● Restructuring, or compromise, is the substitution of an alternative goal, although such a 
goal may be of a lower or different order – for example, taking an additional part-time job 
because of failure to be promoted to a higher grade, or reassessing the work/life balance.
Frustration (negative responses)
Frustration is a negative response to the blockage of a desired goal and results in a defen-
sive form of behaviour. There are many possible reactions to frustration caused by the failure 
to achieve a desired goal. These can be summarised under four broad headings: aggression, 
regression, fixation and withdrawal.50 However, these categories are not mutually exclusive. 
Most forms of frustration-induced behaviour at work are a combination of aggression, regres-
sion and fixation.
Aggression is a physical or verbal attack on some person or object, for example striking a 
supervisor, rage or abusive language, destruction of equipment or documents, or malicious 
gossip about a superior. Where a direct attack cannot be made against the actual barrier or 
blocking agent, because for example the source of frustration is not clear or specific, or where 
the source is feared, as with a powerful superior, aggression may be displaced towards some 
other person or object. With displaced aggression the person may find a scapegoat for the out-
let of frustration – for example, picking arguments or being short-tempered with colleagues or 
slamming the filing cabinet. A more constructive form of displaced aggression is working off 
frustrated feelings through demanding physical work or sport, or perhaps by shouting/cursing 
when alone or in the company of an understanding colleague.
Regression is reverting to a childish or more primitive form of behaviour – for example, 
sulking, crying, tantrums or kicking a broken machine or piece of equipment.
Fixation is persisting in a form of behaviour that has no adaptive value and continuing to 
repeat actions that have no positive results – for example, the inability to accept change or new 
ideas, repeatedly trying a door that is clearly locked or a machine that clearly will not work, or 
insisting on applying for promotion even though not qualified for the job.
Withdrawal is apathy, giving up or resignation – for example, arriving at work late and leav-
ing early, sickness and absenteeism, refusal to accept responsibility, avoiding decision-making, 
passing work over to colleagues or leaving the job altogether.

 Factors inﬂ uencing frustration 
 Among the factors that determine an individual’s reaction to frustration are the: 
 ●  strength of motivation;  
 ●  level and potency of need (see, for example, Maslow’s theory of motivation); 
 ●  degree of attachment to the desired goal; 
 ●  perceived nature of the barrier or blocking agent; and 
 ●  personality characteristics of the individual. 
 It is important that managers attempt to reduce potential frustration-induced behaviour 
through, for example:  
 ●  eff ective recruitment, selection and socialisation; 
 ●  training and development; 
 ●  job design and work organisation; 
 ●  equitable HRM policies; 
 ●  recognition and rewards; 
 ●  eff ective communications; 
 ●  participative styles of management; and 
 ●  attempting to understand the individual’s perception of the situation. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 motivation at work is very subjective and affected by many variables including personality, cultural influences, 
unknown circumstances and relationships outside of work. Generalised theories cannot meet all individual circum-
stances and are therefore a complete waste of your study time. 
 To what extent do YOU agree? What practical value do YOU place on the various theories of motivation? 
 Job satisfaction 
 Attempting to understand the nature of job satisfaction, its relationship with motivation and 
its eff ects on work performance is not easy. Job satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted 
concept, which can mean diff erent things to diff erent people. Although the level of job satis-
faction may well aff ect strength of work motivation, this is not always the case. Satisfaction 
is not the same as motivation.  Job satisfaction is more of an attitude, an internal state. It 
could, for example, be associated with a personal feeling of achievement, either quantitative 
or qualitative. 
 The relationship between job satisfaction and work performance is an issue of continuing 
debate and controversy. One view, associated with the early human relations approach, is that 
satisfaction leads to performance. An alternative view is that performance leads to satisfac-
tion. Recall, for example, the Porter and Lawler expectancy model  (discussed above). 
 Reeves draws attention to the relationship between accomplishment at work and the need 
to ‘work harder’: 
 All this busy-ness and stress is creating more heat than light. It is a sign not of work being too 
hard but too shallow. Human nature is driven by a desire to accomplish things, and so the 
fewer opportunities for accomplishment a job contains, the more likely we are to fi ll the void 
by tearing around in a frenzy in an eff ort to persuade ourselves and others that our work has 
a purpose, that it is important. 51 

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
251
Dimensions of job satisfaction
There is doubt whether job satisfaction consists of a single dimension or a number of separate 
dimensions. Some workers may be satisfied with certain aspects of their work and dissatisfied 
with other aspects. The level of job satisfaction is affected by a wide range of variables relating 
to individual, social, cultural, organisational and environmental factors:
● Individual factors include personality, education and qualifications, intelligence and abili-
ties, age, marital status, orientation to work.
● Social factors include relationships with co-workers, group working and norms, opportuni-
ties for interaction, informal organisation.
● Cultural factors include ethnicity, underlying attitudes, beliefs and values.
● Organisational factors include nature and size, formal structure, HR policies and proce-
dures, nature of the work, technology and work organisation, styles of leadership, manage-
ment systems, working conditions.
● Environmental factors include economic, social, technical and governmental influences.
These different factors all affect the job satisfaction of certain individuals in a given set 
of circumstances but not necessarily in others. For example, in times of economic depres-
sion and fears of high unemployment, job security is likely to be a prominent concern. A 
survey by the Chartered Management Institute found that organisational culture and val-
ues emerged as very strong motivational drivers, and managers’ relationship with their line 
manager had a powerful impact on job satisfaction and related measures.52 The FreshMinds 
survey (discussed in Chapter 3), suggests that when it comes to job satisfaction it pays to 
be older. Apparently 100 per cent of older baby-boomers (born between 1946 and 1963) are 
satisfied with their job, but only 66 per cent of Generation Y (typified by travel first, then a 
career) feel the same way. And Generation Y want more at work, such as gym membership 
and sabbaticals.53
According to De Vita, well-being at work pays because employees who are happy and 
healthy take fewer days off sick, are more productive and more likely to stay with their organi-
sation. The starting point to supporting and promoting well-being in the workplace has to be 
good people management and effective work organisation. Good line management is the most 
important of the characteristics of a high-quality workplace that has high levels of commit-
ment and low absence rates.54
An increasingly important issue affecting job satisfaction and efficiency is the nature of the 
work environment and workplace facilities (discussed in Chapter 11).
Over the years, a number of different surveys suggest good interpersonal relationships with 
colleagues is more important to enjoying your work than a high salary. In 2014, a Cabinet 
Office survey of life satisfaction of 274 different occupations found members of the clergy, 
farmers, fitness instructors, school secretaries, dental nurses and farm workers among those 
with modest salaries but high personal job satisfaction.55
Alienation at work
One main approach to job satisfaction is in terms of frustration and alienation at work. 
Job satisfaction can be seen as the obverse of frustration at work (discussed above). Aliena-
tion refers to the detachment of the person from their work role. The concept of alienation 
at work is associated originally with the views of Marx.56 He saw the division of labour in 
pursuit of profit, and exploitation by employers, as a denial of the workers’ need for self-
expression. Workers become estranged from the product of their work. Work no longer 
provides a satisfying experience in itself, but represents a means of satisfying other external 
demands.

252
Part 2  The individual	
The concept of alienation has been extended by Blauner.57 He describes alienation in terms 
of four dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, isolation and self-estrangement.
● Powerlessness denotes the workers’ lack of control over management policy, immediate 
work processes, or conditions of employment.
● Meaninglessness stems from standardisation and division of labour. It denotes the inability 
to see the purpose of work done or to identify with the total production process or finished 
product.
● Isolation is not belonging to an integrated work group or to the social work organisation 
and not being guided by group norms of behaviour.
● Self-estrangement is the failure to see work as an end in itself or as a central life issue. Workers 
experience a depersonalised detachment and work is seen solely as a means to an end.
In recent years attention to job satisfaction has also become more closely associated with 
broader approaches to improved job design and work organisation (discussed in Chapter 11), 
and the quality of working life movement, and with stress and the work/life balance (discussed 
in Chapter 3).
Comprehensive model of job enrichment
Attempts to improve intrinsic motivation must not only include considerations of job char-
acteristics, but also take account of individual differences and attributes, and people’s orien-
tation to work. A popular and comprehensive model of job enrichment has been developed 
by Hackman and Oldham (see Figure 7.15).58 The model views job enrichment in terms of 
increasing five core job dimensions: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and 
feedback from the job.

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
253
Five core dimensions
The five core job dimensions can be summarised as follows:
● skill variety – the extent to which a job entails different activities and involves a range of 
skills and talents;
● task identity – the extent to which a job involves completion of a whole piece of work with 
a visible outcome;
● task significance – the extent to which a job has a meaningful impact on other people, 
either inside or outside the organisation;
● autonomy – the extent to which a job provides freedom, independence and discretion in 
planning the work and determining how to undertake it;
● feedback – the extent to which work activities result in direct and clear information on the 
effectiveness of job performance.
The extent of these core job dimensions create three critical psychological states based on the 
individual’s perception of:
● experienced value and meaningfulness of the work;
● experienced personal responsibility for the outcomes of the work; and
● clear knowledge of actual results of work activities and level of performance.
An example of a job with little enrichment could be that of a production assembly line worker 
or a kitchen porter, where all five core characteristics are likely to score low. An example of an 
enriched job could be that of a parish priest who draws upon a wide range of social skills and 
talents, who can usually identify with the whole task and whose job has clear and important 
meaning and significance. There is a very high level of autonomy and likely to be direct and 
clear feedback.
Motivating potential score
From these five core job dimensions, Hackman and Oldham have developed an equation that 
gives a single index of a person’s job profile. By answering a questionnaire – the Job Diagnostic 
Survey (JDS) – and by giving a score (between 1 and 7) to each job dimension, the person can 
calculate an overall measure of job enrichment, called the motivating potential score (MPS).
Examples of questions from the JDS are:
● How much variety is there in your job?
● To what extent does your job involve doing a whole and identifiable piece of work?
● In general, how significant or important is your job?
● How much autonomy is there in your job?
● To what extent does doing the job itself provide you with information about your work 
performance?
MPS =
5Skill variety + Task identity + Task significance6
3
* Autonomy * Feedback
The first three job dimensions of skill variety, task identity and task significance are aver-
aged, since it is the combination of these dimensions that contributes to experienced meaning-
fulness of work. The remaining two job dimensions, autonomy and feedback, stand on their 
own. Since scores for skill variety, task identity and task significance are additive, this means 
that the absence of one dimension can be partially offset by the presence of the other dimen-
sions. However, if either autonomy or feedback is absent then, because of the multiplicative 
relationship, the MPS would be zero. The job would offer no potential to motivate the person.
From their studies, Hackman and Oldham claim that people with enriched jobs and high 
score levels on the JDS experienced more satisfaction and internal motivation. The core job 
dimensions of skill variety, task identity and task significance combined to predict the level of 

254
part 2 tHE individUaL 
experienced meaningfulness of the work. The core dimensions of autonomy and feedback did 
not relate so clearly to experienced responsibility and knowledge of results 
 Based on integrating Hackman and Oldham’s job characteristics model with Maslow’s 
hierarchy of needs,  Roe et al. propose a general model of work motivation, tested with Bulgar-
ian, Hungarian and Dutch workers. The model indicates that situational characteristics lead 
to critical psychological factors, inducing two main motivational factors – job involvement 
and organisational commitment – which in turn lead to two proximal outcomes of work moti-
vation – eff ort and job satisfaction – which aff ect performance, stress and tendency to leave the 
organisation. Although there were some diff erences that draw attention to cultural variables, 
there was also a large degree of similarity in results across the three countries. 59 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 individuals have a variety of changing, and often conflicting, needs and expectations, which they attempt to satisfy 
in a number of ways at different times. 
 What are the most powerful influences on YOUR own potential work motivation and job satisfaction? How do YOU 
think these are likely to change in five years’ time? 
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  the relationship between the organisation and its members is infl uenced by what motivates 
them to work, and the rewards and fulfi lment derived from it. 
  2  individuals have a variety of changing, and often competing, needs and expectations at work, 
which they attempt to satisfy in a number of ways. 
  3  a person’s work motivation, satisfaction and performance are determined by the comparative 
strength of economic rewards, intrinsic satisfaction and social relationships. 
  4  there are many competing theories that attempt to explain motivation at work. they show 
there are many motives that infl uence people’s behaviour and performance. 
  5  content theories place emphasis on what actually motivates the individual at work. main the-
ories include those of maslow, alderfer, nohria, Herzberg and mcclelland. 
  6  Process theories are concerned with the dynamic variables that make up motivation. major 
approaches include expectancy-based models, equity theory, goal theory and attribution 
theory. 
  7   another possible approach to motivation is organisational behaviour modifi cation and the 
application of learning principles to behaviour at work. 
  8   Understanding the nature of job satisfaction and links with work performance is not easy. job 
satisfaction may aff ect motivation but this is not always the case. 
  9   satisfaction is an internal state associated with a feeling of personal achievement. one 
approach is in terms of frustration and alienation at work. 
  10   attention has also been given to a comprehensive model of job enrichment based on skill 
variety, task identity, task signifi cance, autonomy and feedback.

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
257
Most people who work in an organisational setting find 
that, apart from their immediate colleagues, their line 
manager is perhaps the most significant influence on 
their life at work. Relationships with the immediate boss 
can affect individuals’ performance, motivation and 
engagement with organisational aims and objectives, 
and because these managers usually work in close prox-
imity with their staff, their strengths and limitations are 
often very visible. Almost everyone will have an opin-
ion about their boss, who is likely to be somewhere in 
the middle between the team with its day-to-day tasks 
and those senior managers who make the big, strategic 
decisions. What exactly does it feel like to be a middle 
manager, and what are the challenges and rewards for 
those who put themselves in the managerial front line?
Middle managers: telling it like it is
In 2006 Management Today published the results of a 
survey into the experiences of middle managers.60 Part of 
its purpose was to match a similar survey of top business 
leaders, which had taken place six months earlier, and to 
discover more about the role and nature of mid-ranking 
managers, many of whom might not have the ambi-
tion to become chief executives or captains of indus-
try, but upon whom most organisations depend for the 
regular delivery of core activities. Over 1,000 ­managers 
took part in the survey, representing both public- and 
private-­sector organisations, and a good 40 per cent of 
respondents were women. Some of the headline figures 
demonstrated a strong sense of job satisfaction, and in 
answer to a question about whether, if they had their 
time again, they would choose to become a manager, 
92 per cent of respondents answered that they had not 
regretted their choice. A small majority, 54 per cent, were 
not actively seeking promotion and a significant majority, 
almost 69 per cent, did not want to step into their own 
boss’s job. Clearly the picture here was one of broad sat-
isfaction with the work and the nature of their managerial 
role. However, 43 per cent felt that they were not valued.
The survey seemed to highlight a number of com-
mon reasons why managers enjoyed their work. Chief 
among these were the following:
●
●
Influence and achievement – the ability to see them-
selves making positive contributions to the organisa-
tion and the way it worked. A significant 88 per cent 
of those surveyed said that this was one of the stron-
gest motivating factors for them.
●
●
Autonomy – 79 per cent considered that a relative 
degree of autonomy was also a source of satisfaction. 
The managers who were happiest in their work were 
those whose own bosses were able to allow them a 
relatively free rein.
●
●
Developing people – again, almost 80 per cent of the 
managers considered that their role in developing 
others, helping people to achieve better levels of per-
formance and encouraging newer or younger work-
ers to be a major source of work-related pleasure.
Things that managers reported as being de-motivat-
ing and that frustrated them in their jobs were the 
following:
●
●
Bureaucracy – 48 per cent cited excessive and 
bureaucratic systems as being what they disliked 
most about their work.
●
●
Pressure to do more with less – this was often what 
stressed managers most. As customers and clients

become more demanding, the lack of resources, 
coupled with increasing spans of control, were clearly 
putting managers under significant strain.
●
●
Politics – 45 per cent of the survey respondents 
believed that office politics was damaging to their 
organisations.
There were some marked differences of opinion about 
how the question of organisational politics should be 
approached; one manager who was interviewed in 
detail for the Management Today report considered it 
was something that had to be understood and handled, 
but others were very critical of the sort of behaviour 
that caused different units or departments of (mostly 
larger) organisations to become close-knit and focused 
on protecting their own interests, often at the expense 
of overall organisational success. This problem surfaced 
again in 2007 when another CMI survey reported that 
44 per cent of senior managers felt they were diverted 
from work by internal politics.61
Leading isn’t easy
Becoming a manager means, for many, a significant 
change in role and perspective, and the transition 
causes a number of common problems for those who 
find themselves in ‘the middle’. One aspect of their man-
agerial work that many reported as problematic was 
the need to learn effective delegation, and to become a 
leader rather than a ‘doer’. One respondent from Hewl-
ett Packard illustrated this point:
When I first became a manager, I tried to do everything 
myself, my old job plus my new responsibilities, but I 
soon realised this was a mistake.
She also noted that being judged on the success of her 
team, rather than on her individual performance, was dif-
ficult to get used to. This related to another problem – the 
difficulty of identifying and dealing with underperform-
ing staff. While workers might believe their colleagues 
to be lazy, they also clearly felt that managers were not 
doing enough to tackle matters of poor performance.62
As Ruth Spellman, Chief Executive of IIP, observed in 
her commentary on the findings:
It is clear from the findings that UK managers are 
aware that dead wood is a problem that can damage 
their organisation – but are failing to do anything 
about it. However, left unchecked . . . [it] . . . can 
breed resentment amongst colleagues and cripple an 
organisation’s productivity.63
On the other hand, if this is set against the complaints 
of micro-management that many employees voiced, 
it becomes clear that the delicate balance between 
effective monitoring and interference is a difficult one 
to achieve.
Another common theme running through the 
Management Today and the CMI surveys was that of 
middle-­manager stress. This arises partly from the causes 
highlighted above, but also from the ambiguity that often 
surrounds the role. Middle managers might be pivotal 
to the actual running of the day-to-day activities of the 
organisation, but while they are accountable to senior 
people who are often the strategic decision-makers, they 
are also embroiled in the minutiae of daily work. This 
results in two very different sets of demands from two 
different directions. A 2010 study by the mental health 
charity Mind found that the level of stress-related absence 
among middle managers was reportedly double that of 
company directors, with 29 per cent of those surveyed 
saying that they had lost their temper with colleagues, and 
25 per cent reporting that they had cried at work. A con-
tributory factor was certainly the amount of unpaid over-
time, which seems to be the lot of the middle manager, 
and issues of work/life balance are problematic for them:64
middle managers are least satisfied with their work–
life balance, most likely to say they are under excessive 
pressure every day, and also most likely to be looking 
for a new job. They also have least job security, with 
nearly one in three thinking it likely they could lose 
their job as a result of the economic downturn.65
In some cases, managers felt not only that the additional 
stresses of taking on a managerial workload removed 
them from the work they enjoyed as specialists, but also 
that the additional pay was scarcely adequate to compen-
sate for the added pressure. One respondent noted that:
There’s only £2k difference in a managerial role pay and 
an analyst below, but the workload increases by 45%.66
Similarly, while middle managers are the key play-
ers in organisational change and development, they 
report that they often find themselves driving through 
initiatives that have been developed and determined by 
those above them in the organisation, who are some-
times those who lack recent knowledge of the realities 
of life on the front line.
But what does the team think?
Finally, what do staff think about their managers? In 
its winter 2014–15 ‘Employee Outlook’ survey, which 
focused on managers,67 the Chartered Institute of Per-
sonnel and Development (CIPD) noted that, on the 
whole, employees are quite positive about their immedi-
ate managers, with 67 per cent of respondents report-
ing satisfactory relationships with their line manager. In 

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
259
particular, employees were happy that they were treated 
fairly (69 per cent), received support when they had 
problems (65 per cent), that their suggestions were lis-
tened to (64 per cent) and were clear about what was 
expected of them (61 per cent). They were less content 
with discussion of training and development (only 36 per 
cent of respondents reported that line managers talked 
with them about training needs) and even fewer (30 per 
cent) reported that they received coaching on the job.
The quality of the relationship with line managers 
can also be seen to underpin levels of employee com-
mitment and engagement.
Both positive line manager behaviours and satisfaction 
with the relationship with the supervisor are positively 
associated with employees being motivated by their 
organisation’s core purpose.68
This echoes findings by Purcell and others, who dis-
covered that the line manager’s ability to consult staff, 
then communicate and explain decisions in a way 
that treats them respectfully, is an important factor in 
creating the sense of fairness that, in turn, supported 
engagement.69
So, however managers are feeling about their own 
work, one thing is clear: they continue to have a major 
influence on the way in which employees think about 
their jobs and the motivation and commitment they 
show towards the organisation where they work. And 
perhaps that is the most important finding of all.
 Tasks
	 1	 Using either the achievement motivation theory of McClelland or Porter and Lawler’s expectancy model as 
the basis for your analysis, explain what might motivate someone to take on a line manager or supervisory 
role in an organisation for which they have worked for some time as a team member.
	 2	 What are the main elements of job satisfaction that managers appear to experience? Which are most 
important, and why? What are the major frustrations, and how do you think a manager should deal with them?
	 3	 To what extent do the results of the CIPD employee survey of winter 2014–15 indicate the motivational 
effect of job enrichment?
	 4	 What lessons could managers take from the Hackman and Oldham model (Figure 7.15) of job enrichment, 
and how could a line manager use these ideas to improve employee commitment and engagement at work?

Academic viewpoint
Below you will find the title and abstract of a recent article in an academic journal that explores a topic relevant to 
the chapters in Part 2.
Timming, A. R. ‘Visible tattoos in the service sector: A new challenge to recruitment and selection’, Work, 
Employment and Society, vol. 29, no. 1, 2015, pp. 60–78. doi: 10.1177/0950017014528402
Abstract
Drawing on 25 in-depth interviews with hiring managers and visibly tattooed respondents, this article explores the 
nature of prejudice surrounding body art in the service sector. It focuses on the impact of visible tattoos on employ-
ment chances. The study reveals a predominantly negative effect on selection, but the extent of employer prejudice 
is mitigated by: where the tattoo is located on the body; the organization or industry type; proximity of the role to 
customers; and the genre of the tattoo. Employer prejudice against tattoos is also driven largely by hiring managers’ 
perceptions of consumer expectations regarding body art in the workplace.
Commentary
Andrew Timming notes that body art such as tattoos 
and piercings are becoming an increasingly popu-
lar and therefore common means of self-adornment 
among young people in Western societies. In particu-
lar he is concerned to investigate the degree to which 
visible tattoos – those on the face, arms or hands, for 
instance – have an impact on the way in which work-
ers in the service sector are viewed by colleagues, 
managers and customers. This in turn is likely to affect 
their job prospects and relationships in the workplace. 
He explains that while anthropological studies of tat-
toos and body art are common, it is rare as a subject 
of employment-related research, and that attitudes 
to body art in the workplace, especially when they 
are hostile, could be examined as a form of prejudice 
and discrimination. The stigma arises from the per-
ceived relationship between tattooing and anti-social 
behaviour. The study is based on a small number of 
case histories and examines managerial attitudes to

Part 2 Case study
Philanthropy: the resurgence of personal social responsibility?
Something rather spectacular happened on 26 June 
2006: Warren Buffett, then the world’s second wealthiest 
man, announced that he intended to give 85 per cent 
of his fortune to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
There, it will join the billions that Bill Gates, the world’s 
wealthiest man, has already pledged, to make an enor-
mous sum of money to support good works around the 
world. A few months earlier, Anita Roddick, who founded 
and built up Body Shop International, had announced 
her intention to give away half of her fortune. Philan-
thropy has long been a noble and admirable part of the 
capitalist tradition and seemed to be back in the news.
Why is this sort of philanthropy of interest to stu-
dents of organisational behaviour? Several reasons can 
be suggested:
● Firstly, of course, the wealth that is given away is 
often the result of setting up and running an organi-
sation that successfully fulfils its purpose over a long 
period: the profits that flow to the owner result from 
customers choosing and paying for its output.
● Also, the generosity of wealthy individuals makes an 
interesting contrast with the more familiar concept 
of ‘corporate social responsibility’, which sometimes 
involves donations of company, rather than personal, 
money.
● The charitable foundations, together with their exter-
nal relationships, are of interest in their own right
The word ‘philanthropy’ is derived from the Greek and 
is defined as ‘love of humankind; the disposition or 
effort to promote the happiness of and well-being of 
one’s fellow-people’.1 The practice of philanthropy was 
well established before that of capitalism of course, 
but the early stages of the growth of the US economy 
saw a significant surge in the social custom of philan-
thropy. Although it may have been no part of their aim, 
the names of some of the USA’s most significant philan-
thropists are as well known for their giving as for the 
business careers that made the money. Two celebrated 
examples from the same era provide a view of the way a 
philanthropic life can be lived.
From Carnegie and Rockefeller to Bill  
and Melinda Gates
Andrew Carnegie (1835–1919) was born in Dunfermline, 
Scotland. He was the son of a weaver and the family emi-
grated to the USA in 1848. Like many at that time, Carn-
egie started work at the age of 13 doing a number of jobs 
until 1865, when he started his own business. This was to 
become the foundation of the steel industry in Pittsburgh 
and the origin of Carnegie’s fortune. At the turn of the 
new century, Carnegie sold the business for $480 million 
and spent the rest of his life devoted to his philanthropic 
interests. These were diverse, but centred around the 
theme of the provision of public libraries and education.2 
Over his life, Carnegie gave away more than $350 million 
(multiply by about twenty for today’s values). Some of the 
quotes attributed to him3 show the combination of hard-
nosed business acumen and the strong sense of social 
duty that characterises this type of philanthropist:
And while the law of competition may be sometimes 
hard for the individual, it is best for the race, because it 
ensures the survival of the fittest in every department.
the tattooed subjects. It analyses the attitudes of hir-
ing managers in relation to their personal views, their 
views about the expectation of customers and the way 
that these two might act together to disadvantage the 
prospects of a visibly tattooed job applicant.
The article might prompt you to consider some 
of the following questions
● Should recruiting managers take into account visible 
tattoos and other forms of body art when hiring peo-
ple for customer-facing jobs?
● Is such body art likely to be more acceptable in cer-
tain industries and organisations than others, and 
does the nature of the tattoo itself make a difference? 
The article contrasts attitudes towards images of 
butterflies or flowers and those of politically loaded 
symbols such as swastikas.
● Should those with visible tattoos be included as a 
legally protected category with regard to workplace 
discrimination?
● Are you likely to be more favourably disposed to 
someone with a tattoo if you have one yourself?

Chapter 7  Work motivation and job satisfaction
263
Surplus wealth is a sacred trust which its possessor is 
bound to administer in his lifetime for the good of the 
community.
I would as soon leave my son a curse as the almighty 
dollar.
As will be seen, similar sentiments and values con-
tinue to motivate today’s philanthropists.
John D. Rockefeller (1839–1937) was born in the USA 
to a farming family. In his business career, he founded 
and developed the Standard Oil Company, which 
became the leading force in the fast-growing oil indus-
try. At the age of 57, Rockefeller decided that he should 
step aside from the day-to-day leadership of Standard 
Oil and devote himself to philanthropy. This had been 
important to him from his early life, but also because 
of his religious convictions and his approach to finance:
I believe it is every man’s religious duty to get all he can 
honestly and to give all he can.
Like Carnegie, his philanthropic interests centred 
on education, with substantial donations to found and 
develop universities and research institutes, as well 
as the establishment of trusts and foundations for the 
improvement of education at all levels. Over his life, 
he gave away some $550 million.4 Again, some of the 
quotes attributed to the man5 show a mixture of hard-
headedness and generosity that is far from sentimental:
Charity is injurious unless it helps the recipient to 
become independent of it.
I believe that every right implies a responsibility; 
every opportunity, an obligation; every possession, a 
duty.
Both Carnegie and Rockefeller were members of the 
group of very powerful US business giants in the late 
1800s known by some as ‘robber barons’. John Kamp-
fner’s 2014 book6 about the super-rich through history 
finds familiar themes in their behaviour, including their 
notable involvement in philanthropy later in their lives. 
For him, the educational foundations, art galleries and 
concert galleries are as much about ‘reputation launder-
ing’ as philanthropy, something that has characterised 
the behaviour of the super-rich over the ages. In his 
view:
Wealth rarely buys peace of mind. The super-rich are 
consumed by what happens next. They fear for their 
legacies and for their children. Will the money they 
have made be safe in their hands? Will the standing 
they have acquired in society be frittered away? Will 
statues be cast in their image?
They want to be remembered for more than making 
a fortune. What matters to them most is reputation.
(Kampfner 2014, Prologue)
Not everyone would share this level of cynicism 
about the motives of the givers, of course, but there is 
often a tension between the means through which for-
tunes are amassed and the great works that are funded 
by the philanthropy.
The emerging philanthropists of the twenty-first cen-
tury have often made their money through businesses 
that were not even heard of in the lifetimes of Carnegie 
and Rockefeller. Bill Gates, for example, is one of the 
founders of the enormously successful Microsoft Cor-
poration, whose information products are about as far 
from steel and oil as can be imagined. This case is mainly 
concerned with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation 
(BMGF), which was established in 1997 with an initial 
gift from the two founders.7 It grew rapidly from 1999: 
in a list published in 20148 it was by a significant mar-
gin the largest foundation in the USA, in terms of both 
value of assets (about $37 billion at the end of 2012) 
and total giving (about $3 billion in year ending 2012). 
By 2014, total grants from the BMGF since its inception 
had grown to almost $33 billion and the organisation 
employed more than 1,200 people in eight locations

(Seattle, Washington DC, Delhi, Beijing and London, 
together with three offices in Africa: Addis Ababa, Abuja 
and Johannesburg).9
The organisation is organised around its four main 
priorities, which are: global development; global health; 
global policy and advocacy; and US programmes. In 
a letter published on the BMGF website,10 Bill and 
Melinda Gates explain their aims in respect of global 
health, pointing out that health is fundamental to eco-
nomic development:
Our friend and co-trustee Warren Buffett once gave 
us some great advice about philanthropy: ‘Don’t just 
go for safe projects,’ he said. ‘Take on the really tough 
problems.’
We couldn’t agree more. Our foundation is team-
ing up with partners around the world to take on some 
tough problems: extreme poverty and poor health in 
developing countries, the failures of America’s educa-
tion system. We focus on only a few issues because we 
think that’s the best way to have great impact, and we 
focus on these issues in particular because we think 
they are the biggest barriers that prevent people from 
making the most of their lives.
For each issue we work on, we fund innovative ideas 
that could help remove these barriers: new techniques 
to help farmers in developing countries grow more 
food and earn more money; new tools to prevent and 
treat deadly diseases; new methods to help students 
and teachers in the classroom. Some of the projects we 
fund will fail. We not only accept that, we expect it – 
because we think an essential role of philanthropy is 
to make bets on promising solutions that governments 
and businesses can’t afford to make. As we learn which 
bets pay off, we have to adjust our strategies and share 
the results so everyone can benefit.
We’re both optimists. We believe by doing these 
things – focusing on a few big goals and working with 
our partners on innovative solutions – we can help 
every person get the chance to live a healthy, produc-
tive life.
In the world of business, as opposed to philanthropic 
foundations, there has been growing interest in recent 
years in the subject of corporate governance: what the 
business is aiming to do and how it can be sure that 
its actions are consistent with those aims. It has been 
common for wealthy individuals to adopt a corporate 
format in making good works happen, often by setting 
up and then directing a dedicated foundation to look 
after both the strategic and operational aspects of the 
task. This seems to acknowledge the benefits of the cor-
porate approach in terms of efficiency and the ability 
to recruit and apply specialist skills, while still retaining 
control by the founder or the founding family. It is also 
easy to appreciate how focused and effective such an 
organisation can be in pursuing the goals of the founder, 
and to acknowledge the possibility that an effective 
philanthropic foundation may be at least as effective as, 
say, a government or international agency.
As will already be clear, some of the world’s philan-
thropic foundations have multinational corporation-
sized (even government-sized) budgets, meaning that 
the issue of governance is rightly of some concern to 
the society within which these organisations operate. 
One does not need to be a fan of James Bond movies to 
appreciate that very rich individuals using their wealth 
to pursue their private aims is not in itself guaranteed to 
be in the general interest.
In fact, foundations often go to some lengths to 
communicate their values and aims publicly. For exam-
ple, the BMGF website sets out some key principles in 
the section ‘Who We Are’, whose subheadings are as 
follows:11
● We seek to unlock the possibility inside every individual.
● We are focused on the areas of greatest need, on the 
ways in which we can do the most good.
● We are focused on results. Those that can be meas-
ured. And those measured in ways beyond numbers.
● We seek to drive change on a global scale.
● We are impatient optimists.
Warren Buffett and Anita Roddick
Warren Buffett’s fortune was made through the Berk-
shire Hathaway organisation, which for many years has 
been very successful in providing investment manage-
ment services for its clients. Buffett himself is famously 
moderate in his lifestyle, with a liking for a diet of burgers 
and Cherry Coke. His extraordinary wealth was recently 
augmented by his firm decision not to get involved in 
the late 1990s dotcom boom and subsequent bust: his 
policy has always been to concentrate on business fun-
damentals and to invest for the long term. He also has 
a long-standing reputation for pithy quotes and one 
attributed remark seemed to sum up the chaos caused 
by the collapse of rapid stock market growth and the 
series of corporate scandals that followed:
It’s only when the tide goes out that you can see who’s 
been swimming without their trunks on.
From remarks made by Buffett since the announce-
ment of his association with the BMGF,12 it seems clear 
that he had been thinking about an involvement in 
philanthropy for some time. Some of his motivation is

bound up with the American tradition of philanthropy 
by wealthy individuals, including the notion that there 
is something problematic about the idea that huge 
wealth should result from accidents of birth. As he has 
suggested, children should be left wealthy enough to 
do anything, but not enough to do nothing. He had 
also become very impressed by the approach taken 
by the BMGF and by Bill and Melinda themselves; the 
announcement coincided with that of the succession 
plans for Gates’s leadership of Microsoft, which allowed 
Gates to devote more time to the BMGF. Buffett has 
become a trustee of the BMGF and jokingly promised at 
the launch not to assess Gates’s efforts more than once 
a day. At the same meeting, both men acknowledged 
the inspirational value that the news of the donation 
could have: one questioner suggested that the suc-
cess of organisations like the BMGF could do much to 
improve public confidence in charitable donation in 
general and perhaps increase the willingness of a far 
wider spectrum of people to give. Since 2010, Gates 
and Buffett have also turned their attention to persuad-
ing other very rich people to give their wealth away 
through their Giving Pledge campaign.13 One nota-
ble feature of the annual Forbes Magazine list of the 
world’s dollar billionaires14 has been the arrival of more 
and more very wealthy people from the fast-emerging 
BRIC economies (e.g. the 2014 list showed three Brazil-
ians in the top 100, along with six Russians, five Indians 
and nine from China/Hong Kong). It will be interesting 
to see how the practice of philanthropy develops in 
these and other emerging economies, where cultural 
traditions may differ from the West and where the local 
needs are often urgent.
The decision by the late UK entrepreneur Anita Rod-
dick to join the ranks of business-based philanthropists 
adds some interesting features to the discussion. Rod-
dick was something of a business celebrity for much of 
her career, having founded and built up the very success-
ful Body Shop International, a business whose market 
appeal was always strongly centred on the values of its 
founder. Its campaigns against animal testing of cosmet-
ics and in favour of fair trade, for example, became prom-
inent during the 1990s. Explaining that she did not want 
to die rich, Roddick announced at the end of 200515 that 
she intended to give away half her £100 million fortune, 
much of which resulted from the sale of her business to 
L’Oreal. Sadly, she died suddenly aged just 64 in Septem-
ber 2007, but the Roddick Foundation survives her.16
In her lifetime, Anita Roddick was often sharply 
critical of some aspects of business life in the UK, espe-
cially where attitudes seemed to her to be selfish and 
short-termist. But, in her view, the rich had to look after 
the poor, and:
I don’t think in our society we have any understanding 
of that.
A BBC article17 commented at the time that personal 
philanthropy was less prominent in the UK than in the 
USA, possibly because people in the UK regard it as a 
government responsibility to look after the poor, with 
projects financed from general taxation and with addi-
tional contributions from companies under the heading 
of ‘corporate social responsibility’. This is not to suggest 
that government programmes and corporate donations 
are by any means unimportant in the USA, but rather to 
emphasise how unusual personal philanthropy has been 
in the UK. However, one recent initiative in the UK made 
its appeal to people on ordinary incomes, rather than 
the world’s billionaires. The organisation Giving What We 
Can18 seeks pledgers to donate 10 per cent of personal 
incomes and offers guidance on the most cost-effective 
charities. As it points out, significant impacts can be 
made by donations at this level over the long term.
Corporate versus personal philanthropy
Many large businesses in the UK have made significant 
donations to charity from corporate funds, which may 
be partly motivated by a desire for approval from some 
stakeholder groups. As such, corporate philanthropy – and 
corporate social responsibility in general – has come 
in for criticism from some quarters, on the basis that 
it amounts to acts of generosity using other people’s 
money (specifically, that of the shareholders, who own

fet, the world’s second wealthiest man, promised to

Part 2  The individual	
the company). The economist Milton Friedman force-
fully suggested for some decades that business should 
get on with the business of business: making money for 
its owners through successfully marketing products and 
services within the law. From this point of view, dona-
tions to charity by individuals making choices about their 
own funds are more desirable than acts of corporate 
generosity using other people’s funds. In reality, public 
opinion seems to be sympathetic towards the idea of 
corporate donations to charity, whatever scepticism may 
sometimes be expressed about motives. However, from 
any reasonable point of view, there remains an impor-
tant difference between giving personally and approving 
corporate gifts: the difference perhaps, between signing 
your own, rather than a company, cheque.
At the BMGF conference mentioned above, Bill Gates 
alluded to the celebrated work of Adam Smith, the Scot-
tish economist who first explained the general benefits 
of free markets in identifying and providing for needs 
effectively and efficiently. From these ideas have come 
the modern economies that provided the context in 
which organisations such as Microsoft, Berkshire Hath-
away and Body Shop International can generate large 
amounts of wealth, mainly through providing products 
and services that are attractive enough to cause people 
to choose to spend their own money on them. In short, 
this is the main reason why recent generations have in 
most cases been richer than their predecessors. The tra-
dition of philanthropy on the part of wealthy individuals 
is by no means contrary to the desirability of free and 
fierce competition; rather, wealth generation and phi-
lanthropy can only go hand in hand.
What is generally less well known about Adam Smith 
is his significant contribution to moral philosophy. Per-
haps the way to bring this discussion to a close is with 
a quote from the beginning of Adam Smith’s Theory of 
Moral Sentiments, which was highlighted by Bill Gates in 
explaining the basic importance of philanthropy.
How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are 
evidently some principles in his nature which interest 
him in the fortune of others and render their happi-
ness necessary to him though he derives nothing from 
it except the pleasure of seeing it.
Philanthropic foundations are organisations that are 
interesting in their own right, in respect of the origin 
of their funds, in their interaction with other types of 
organisation and, of course, in the effects they have on 
the societies within which they operate.

business based on caring values, gave half of her wealth

Tasks
1	 Not all successful business leaders become renowned philanthropists like Gates, Roddick and others. Using 
concepts from Chapter 4 as the basis for your analysis, suggest which aspects of individual personality 
might explain why some do and others do not.
2	 Philanthropic foundations have often been created to transfer knowledge and skills from their countries of 
origin to people living in parts of the developing world. What challenges might those who work for such 
organisations face in achieving this task, and how could theories of learning help them?
3	 To some extent, philanthropic foundations are engaged in the same types of social projects as government 
agencies. How might approaches to employee motivation differ between the two types of organisation? 
What could either type of organisation usefully learn from the other?

 PART 3 
 groups, leadership and management 

 self-interest and opportunism are natural features of human behaviour and will always take preference over the 
demands and best interests of the group or teamwork. 
 To what extent can YOU present a counter point of view? How far are YOU prepared to put the interests of a work 
group or team before YOUR own interests? 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Work is a group-based activity and if the organisation is to function 
eff ectively it requires collaboration and co-operation among its 
members. most activities of the organisation require at least some 
degree of co-ordination through groups and teamwork. understanding 
the nature, operation and impact of groups and teams is vital if the 
manager is to infl uence the behaviour and performance of people in the 
work situation. 
 Learning outcomes 
 After completing this chapter you should have enhanced your ability to: 
 ●  explain the nature and signifi cance of work groups and teams; 
 ●  relate the nature of informal groups and importance of group values and norms; 
 ●  examine factors that infl uence group cohesiveness and performance; 
 ●  identify characteristics of an eff ective work group and virtual teams; 
 ●  explain role structure of the organisation and individual role relationships; 
 ●  evaluate individual compared with group or team performance; 
 ●  review the importance and characteristics of successful groups or teams.

 Working in groups and teams 

Chapter 8  Working in groups and teams
271
The importance and significance of groups
Groups are a characteristic of all social situations. Individuals seldom work in isolation from 
others. The work organisation and its sub-units are made up of groups of people. Groups are 
an essential feature of any organisation and almost every member of staff will belong to one or 
more groups. Although there is no single accepted definition, most people will readily under-
stand what constitutes a group. The essential feature is that its members regard themselves as 
belonging to the group. A popular definition defines the group in psychological terms as:
any number of people who (1) interact with one another; (2) are psychologically aware of 
one another; and (3) perceive themselves to be a group.1
Another useful way of defining a work group is a collection of people who share most, if not 
all, of the following characteristics:
● a definable membership;
● group consciousness;
● a sense of shared purpose;
● interdependence;
● interaction;
● ability to act in a unitary manner.2
Members of a group must co-operate in order for work to be carried out, and managers them-
selves will work within these groups. The working of groups and the influence they exert over 
their membership is an essential feature of management and organisational behaviour. People 
in groups influence each other in many ways and groups develop their own hierarchies and 
leaders. Group pressures can have a major influence over the behaviour of individual members 
and their work performance.
Peterson and colleagues discuss the importance of morale as an indicator of group well-
being. The attention of positive psychology to promote good life (discussed in Chapter 1) 
should include not only individuals but also groups within which individuals live, work, love 
and play. Groups should be a primary focus of research into health and well-being.3
Groups and teams
The use of the word ‘teams’ has become increasingly fashionable in recent years. In common 
usage and literature, including in this book, there is a tendency for the terms ‘groups’ and 
‘teams’ to be used interchangeably and based on personal preference. It is not easy to distin-
guish clearly between a group and a team. According to ACAS:
Teams have been around for as long as anyone can remember and there can be few organi-
sations that have not used the term in one sense or another. It is common to hear of man-
agement teams, production teams, service teams or even whole organisations referred to as 
teams . . . The term ‘team’ is used loosely to describe many different groupings and a variety 
of labels are given to the types of teams . . . It is doubtful whether any definition of types of 
teams would be universally acceptable.4
Holpp poses the question ‘Why do you want teams?’ While many people are still pay-
ing homage to teams, teamwork, empowerment and self-management, others have become 
disillusioned.
If teams are just a convenient way to group under one manager a lot of people who used to 
work for several downsized supervisors, don’t bother. But if teams can truly take ownership 
of work areas and provide the kind of up-close knowledge that’s unavailable elsewhere, then 
full speed ahead.5

272
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
Cane suggests that organisations are sometimes unsure whether they have teams or simply 
groups of people working together.
It is certainly true to say that any group of people who do not know they are a team cannot 
be one. To become a team, a group of individuals needs to have a strong common purpose 
and to work towards that purpose rather than individually. They need also to believe that 
they will achieve more by co-operation than working individually.6
Teamwork as a fashionable term
Belbin points out that to the extent that teamwork was becoming a fashionable term, it began 
to replace the more usual reference to groups and every activity was now being described as 
‘teamwork’. He questions whether it matters whether one is talking about groups or teams 
and maintains that the confusion in vocabulary should be addressed if the principles of good 
teamwork are to be retained. Belbin suggests there are several factors that characterise the dif-
ference between groups and teams (see Figure 8.1). The best differentiator is size: groups can 
comprise any number of people but teams are smaller with a membership between (ideally) 
four and six. The quintessential feature of a small, well-balanced team is that leadership is 
shared or rotates, whereas large groups typically throw up solo leaders.7
While acknowledging the work of Belbin, it appears that the term ‘group’ is often used in 
a more general sense and ‘team’ in a more specific context. We continue to refer to ‘group’ 
or ‘team’ according to the particular focus of attention and the vocabulary of the quoted 
authors. Whereas all teams are, by definition, groups, it does not necessarily follow that all 
groups are teams. The Chartered Management Institute maintains that a team is more than 
just a group of people who happen to work together.
It is a group of people working towards common goals and objectives and sharing responsi-
bility for the outcomes. Team building is the process of selecting and grouping team members 
effectively and developing good working relationships and practices enabling the team to 
steer and develop the work and reach their goals. Increasingly, a team may be composed of 
people drawn from different functions, departments and disciplines whom have been brought 
together for a specific project.8

Chapter 8 Working in groups and teams
273
 Whatever the debate on ‘groups’ or ‘teams’, what is clear is the increasing popularity of 
teamworking and the importance to organisations of eff ective group working or teamworking. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 it is almost impossible to distinguish clearly or in any meaningful way between work groups and teams. attempting 
to do so is a vain, and pointless, quest. it is a waste of study time. 
 What is YOUR reaction to this assertion? How do YOU distinguish between a work group and team? 
  Formal and informal groups 
 Groups are formed as a consequence of the pattern of organisation structure and arrange-
ments for the division of work, for example the grouping together of common activities into 
divisions or sections.  Formal groups are created to achieve specifi c organisational objectives 
and are concerned with the  co-ordination of work activities. People are brought together on 
the basis of defi ned roles within the structure of the organisation. The nature of the tasks to 
be undertaken is a predominant feature of the formal group. Goals are identifi ed by manage-
ment, and certain rules, relationships and norms of behaviour established. 
 Groups may result from the nature of technology employed and the way in which work 
is carried out, for example bringing together a number of people to carry out a sequence of 
operations on an assembly line. Groups may also develop when a number of people of the 
same level or status within the organisation see themselves as a group, for example depart-
mental heads of an industrial organisation or chief offi  cers of a local authority. Formal 
groups tend to be relatively permanent, although there may be changes in actual member-
ship. However, temporary formal groups may also be created by management, as with, for 
example, the use of project teams in a matrix organisation.  (See also matrix organisation 
in  Chapter  11 .)  
 Informal groups 
 The formal structure of the organisation, and system of role relationships, rules and proce-
dures, will be augmented by interpretation and development at the informal level. Groups will 
also arise from social processes and the informal organisation  (discussed in  Chapter  3 ). 
 Informal groups are based more on personal relationships and agreement of group mem-
bers than on defi ned role relationships. They serve to satisfy psychological and social needs 
not related necessarily to the tasks to be undertaken. Informal groups may devise ways of 
attempting to satisfy members’ affi  liation and other social motivations lacking in the work 
situation. Membership can cut across the formal structure. These groups may comprise indi-
viduals from diff erent parts of the organisation and/or from diff erent levels of the organisa-
tion, both vertically and diagonally, as well as from the same horizontal level. An informal 
group could also be the same as the formal group, or it might comprise a part only of the 
formal group ( see  Figure  8.2 ). 
 Members of an informal group may appoint their own leader who exercises authority by 
consent of the members themselves. The informal leader may be chosen as the person who 
refl ects the attitudes and values of the members, helps to resolve confl ict, leads the group 
in satisfying its goals, or liaises with management or other people outside the group. The 
informal leader may change according to the particular situation facing the group. Although 
not usually the case, it is possible for the informal leader to be the same person as the formal 
leader appointed offi  cially by management. 

274
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
Major functions of informal groups
Lysons suggests four main reasons for informal groups:
● Perpetuation of the informal group ‘culture’. Culture in this context means a set of values, 
norms and beliefs that form a guide to group acceptance and group behaviour. Unless you 
broadly subscribe to the group culture, you will not belong and will be an ‘outsider’ or 
‘isolate’.
● Maintenance of a communication system. Groups want all the information that affects 
their welfare, either negatively or positively. If groups are not apprised of policies and 
motives behind actions, they will seek to tap into formal communication channels and 
spread information among group members.
● Implementation of social control. Conformity to group culture is enforced by such tech-
niques as ridicule, ostracism and violence. This is illustrated, for example, by the enforce-
ment of group norms in the bank wiring room discussed in the next section.
● Provision of interest and fun in work-life. Many jobs are monotonous and fail to hold 
workers’ attention. Work may also offer few prospects. Workers may try to compensate by 
interpersonal relations provided by the group and in such activities as time wasting by talk-
ing, gambling, practical joking and drinking.9
As Law reminds us:
We humans are a gregarious lot. We like to gather together and establish our own social 
networks, which are often the real key to creativity and innovation in organisations . . . But 
many managers are unaware that seemingly pointless social networking does in fact play a 
crucial part in the way people interact with each other and get work done.10
Group values and norms
The classical approach to organisation and management tended to ignore the importance of 
groups and the social factors at work. The human relations approach, however (discussed 
in Chapter 2), gave recognition to the work organisation as a social organisation and to the 
importance of the group, and group values and norms, in influencing behaviour at work.
Figure 8.2  Examples of informal groups within the formal structure of an organisation

Chapter 8  Working in groups and teams
275
In the Hawthorne studies, one experiment involved the observation of a group of fourteen 
men working in the bank wiring room who formed their own sub-groups or cliques, with nat-
ural leaders emerging with the consent of the members. Despite a financial incentive scheme 
for the more work they did, the group decided on a level of output well below what they 
were capable of achieving. Group pressures on individual workers were stronger than financial 
incentives offered by management.
Informal social relations
The group developed its own pattern of informal social relations and codes and practices 
(‘norms’) of what constituted proper group behaviour.
● Not to be a ‘rate buster’ – Not to produce at too high a rate of output compared with other 
members or to exceed the production restriction of the group.
● Not to be a ‘chiseller’ – Not to shirk production or to produce at too low a rate of output 
compared with other members of the group.
● Not to be a ‘squealer’ – Not to say anything to the supervisor or management that might be 
harmful to other members of the group.
● Not to be ‘officious’ – People with authority over members of the group, for example 
inspectors, should not take advantage of their seniority or maintain a social distance from 
the group.
The group had its own system of sanctions including sarcasm, damaging completed work, 
hiding tools, playing tricks on the inspectors and ostracising those members who did not con-
form to the group norms. Threats of physical violence were also made and the group devel-
oped a system of punishing offenders by ‘binging’, which involved striking someone a fairly 
hard blow on the upper part of the arm. This process of binging also became a recognised 
method of controlling conflict within the group.
Importance of social norms
According to Riches, one way to improve team performance is to establish agreed norms or 
rules for how the team is to operate and rigorously stick to them. Norms could address the 
obligations of individual members to the team, how it will assess its performance, how it will 
work together, what motivation systems will be used, how it will relate to customers, and the 
mechanisms to facilitate an honest exchange about the team norms and behaviour.11
A study by the Economic & Social Research Council draws attention to the importance 
of social norms among employees and questions whether employees are guided not only by 
monetary incentives, but also by peer pressure towards social efficiency for the workers as 
a group: ‘Intuitively, social norms among workers must be important if they work in teams 
where bonuses are dependent on group rather than individual effort.’12 (You may see some 
similarity here with the bank wiring room experiment, discussed above.)
A concept map of group norms is set out in Figure 8.3.
Reasons for formation of groups or teams
Individuals have varying expectations of the benefits from group membership, both formal 
and informal, relating to both work performance and social processes.
● Certain tasks can be performed only through the combined efforts of a number of indi-
viduals working together. The variety of experience, knowledge and expertise among mem-
bers provides a synergetic effect that can be applied to the increasingly complex problems 
of modern organisations.
● Collusion between members in order to modify formal working arrangements more to 
their liking – for example, by sharing or rotating unpopular tasks. Membership therefore 
provides the individual with opportunities for initiative and creativity.

277
 ●  Companionship and a source of mutual understanding and support from colleagues. This 
can help in solving work problems and also to militate against stressful or demanding 
working conditions. 
 ●  Membership provides the individual with a sense of belonging.  It provides a feeling of iden-
tity and the chance to acquire role recognition and status within the group or team.  (See the 
discussion on social identity theory below.) 
 ●  Guidelines on generally acceptable behaviour. These help to clarify ambiguous situations, 
such as the extent to which offi  cial rules and regulations are expected to be adhered to in 
practice, the rules of the game and what is seen as the correct actual behaviour. Allegiance 
to the group or team can serve as a means of control over individual behaviour and indi-
viduals who contravene the norms may be disciplined. 
 ●  Protection for its membership. Group or team members collaborate to protect their inter-
ests from outside pressures or threats. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 given the importance of social interactions and interpersonal relationships for morale, job satisfaction and work per-
formance, the main focus of your studies should be on the operations and management of the informal organisation. 
 Can YOU present a counterargument to this contention? How much have YOU learned about the importance and 
influence of the informal organisation? 
  Group cohesiveness and performance 
 Social interaction is a natural feature of human behaviour and work organisation but ensuring 
harmonious working relationships and eff ective teamwork is not an easy task. Co-operation is 
likely to be greater in a united, cohesive group. Membership can be a rewarding experience for 
the individual, contribute to the promotion of morale and aid release of creativity and energy. 
Members of a high-morale group are more likely to think of themselves as a group and work 
together eff ectively. Strong and cohesive work groups can, therefore, have benefi cial eff ects for 
the organisation. There are many factors that aff ect group cohesiveness and performance, 
which can be summarised under four broad headings, as shown in  Figure  8.4 . 
 Membership 
 Size of the group 
 As a group increases in size, problems arise with communications and co-ordination. Large 
groups are more diffi  cult to handle and require a higher level of supervision. Absenteeism also 
tends to be higher. When a group becomes too large it may split into smaller units and friction 
may develop between the sub-groups. It is diffi  cult to put a precise fi gure on the ideal size of a 
work group. Much will depend upon other variables, but it seems to be generally accepted that 
cohesiveness becomes more diffi  cult to achieve when a group exceeds ten to twelve members.  13 
Beyond this size the group tends to split into sub-groups. A fi gure of between fi ve and seven is 
often quoted as an apparent optimum size for full participation within the group. 
 Cane asks the question: ‘How many people should be in a team?’ 
 The answers from diff erent organisations as to what is the perfect number vary from between 
four and fi fteen depending on a whole range of variables. Fifteen is about the maximum 

278
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
number of people anyone can communicate with without having to raise their voice signifi-
cantly and any less than four has a restriction in the amount of creativity and variety that 
can be produced. It is interesting to note that these figures range between the maximum and 
minimum numbers of sports teams – perhaps less of a coincidence than it seems.14
Compatibility of members
The more homogeneous the group in terms of such features as shared backgrounds, interests, 
attitudes and values of its members, the easier it is usually to promote cohesiveness. Variations 
in other individual differences, such as personality or skills of members, may serve to comple-
ment each other and help make for a cohesive group. However, such differences may be the 
cause of disruption and conflict. Conflict can also arise in a homogeneous group where mem-
bers are in competition with each other. Individual incentive payment schemes, for example, 
may be a source of conflict.
Permanence of group members
Group spirit and relationships take time to develop. Cohesiveness is more likely when mem-
bers of a group are together for a reasonable length of time and changes occur only slowly. A 
frequent turnover of members is likely to have an adverse effect on morale and on the cohesive-
ness of the group.
Figure 8.4  Factors contributing to group cohesiveness and performance

Chapter 8  Working in groups and teams
279
Work environment
Nature of the task
Where workers are involved in similar work, share a common task or face the same problems, 
this may assist cohesiveness. The nature of the task may serve to bring people together when 
it is necessary to communicate and interact regularly – for example, members of a research 
and development team. Even if members of a group normally work at different locations they 
may still experience a feeling of cohesiveness if the nature of the task requires frequent com-
munication and interaction – for example, security guards patrolling separate areas who need 
to check with each other on a regular basis.
Physical setting
Where members of a group work in the same location or in close physical proximity to each 
other this may generally help cohesiveness. However, this is not always the case. For example, 
in large open-plan offices staff often tend to segregate themselves from colleagues and cre-
ate barriers through the strategic siting of such items as filing cabinets, bookcases or indoor 
plants. The size of the office and the number of staff in it are, of course, important considera-
tions in this case. Isolation from other groups of workers will also tend to build cohesiveness. 
This often applies to a smaller number of workers on a night shift.
Communications
The more easily members can communicate freely with each other, the greater the likelihood 
of group cohesiveness. Communications are affected by the work environment, by nature of 
the task and technology. For example, difficulties in communication can arise with production 
systems where workers are stationed continuously at a particular point with limited freedom 
of movement. Even when opportunities exist for interaction with colleagues, physical condi-
tions may limit effective communication. For example, the technological layout and high level 
of noise with some assembly line work can limit contact between workers. Changes in the 
nature of work, including increasing demand for flexible working arrangements, may restrict 
opportunities for social interaction and hamper internal group unity.15
Technology
Technology is clearly a major influence on patterns of group operation and behaviour. ACAS 
draws attention to technological advances and how new technology enables production to be 
tailored quickly to customer requirements, often on an individual basis.
Mass production techniques, where jobs are broken down into simple tasks, are not suitable 
for the new customer focused manufacturing nor the expectations of an educated workforce. 
Organisations need workers to be more flexible, to co-operate with other workers, supervisors 
and managers throughout the organisation, to operate sophisticated technology and to be 
more adaptable. In addition, the sheer complexity of operations in industry, commerce and 
the services places them beyond the expertise and control of any one individual. In these cir-
cumstances some form of teamwork becomes not just desirable but essential.16
The impact of IT demands new patterns of work organisation and affects the formation 
and structure of groups. Improvements in telecommunications mean that support staff need 
no longer be located within the main production unit. Individuals may work more on their 
own, from their homes, shared offices or hotels, or work more with machines than with other 
people.

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
Organisational
Management and leadership
Teams tend to be a mirror image of their leaders. The form of management and style of lead-
ership adopted are major determinants of group cohesiveness. In general terms, cohesiveness 
will be affected by such things as the manner in which the manager gives support, guidance 
and encouragement to the group, provides opportunities for participation, attempts to resolve 
conflicts and gives attention to both employee relations and task problems.
McKenna and Maister draw attention to the importance of the group leader establishing 
a level of trust among the group by helping its members understand the behaviours that build 
trust: ‘The job of the group leader is to encourage people to earn the trust of others in their 
group and then show them how it can translate into greater commitment, greater creativity, 
greater professional satisfaction, and better performance.’17 Farrell makes the point that man-
agers are ultimately responsible for creating a balance in the workplace and should take the 
lead in setting standards of behaviour in teams.18
HR policies and procedures
Harmony and cohesiveness within the group are more likely to be achieved if HR policies and 
procedures are well developed and perceived to be equitable, with fair treatment for all mem-
bers. Attention should be given to the effects that appraisal systems, discipline, promotion and 
rewards and opportunities for personal development have on members of the group.
Success
Success is usually a strong motivational influence on cohesiveness and level of work perfor-
mance. Success or reward as a positive motivator can be perceived by group members in a 
number of ways – for example, the satisfactory completion of a task through co-operative 
action, praise from management, a feeling of high status, achievement in competition with 
other groups or benefits gained, such as high wage payments from a group bonus incentive 
scheme.
External threat
Cohesiveness may be enhanced by members co-operating with one another when faced with 
a common external threat, such as changes in their method of work or the appointment of 
a new manager. Even if the threat is subsequently removed, the group may continue to have 
a greater degree of cohesiveness than before the threat arose. Conflict between groups will 
also tend to increase the cohesiveness of each group and the boundaries of the group become 
drawn more clearly.
Group development and maturity
The degree of cohesiveness is affected also by the manner in which groups progress through 
the various stages of development and maturity before getting down to the real tasks in hand. 
This process can take time and is often traumatic for the members. A popular model by Tuck-
man identifies five main successive stages of group development and relationships: forming, 
storming, norming, performing and adjourning.19
● Stage 1 – forming. This concerns initial formation of the group and bringing together 
individuals who identify, tentatively, the purpose of the group, its composition and terms 
of reference. Consideration is given to the hierarchical structure of the group, pattern of 

Chapter 8 Working in groups and teams
281
leadership, individual roles and responsibilities and codes of conduct. There is likely to 
be considerable anxiety as members attempt to create an impression, test each other and 
establish their personal identity within the group. 
 ●  Stage 2 –  storming. As members of the group get to know each other better they will put 
forward their views more openly and forcefully. Disagreements will be expressed and chal-
lenges off ered on the nature of the task and arrangements made in the earlier stage of devel-
opment. This may lead to confl ict and hostility. The storming stage is important because, if 
successful, there will be discussions on reforming arrangements for the working and opera-
tion of the group, and agreement on more meaningful structures and procedures. 
 ●  Stage 3 –  norming. As confl ict and hostility start to be controlled, members of the group 
will establish guidelines and standards and develop their own norms of acceptable behav-
iour. The norming stage is important in establishing the need for members to co-operate in 
order to plan, agree standards of performance and fulfi l the purpose of the group. 
 ●  Stage 4 –  performing. When the group has progressed successfully through the three earlier 
stages of development it will have created structure and cohesiveness to work eff ectively as 
a team. At this stage the group can concentrate on the attainment of its purpose and per-
formance of the common task is likely to be at its most eff ective. 
 ●  Stage 5 –  adjourning. This refers to the adjourning or disbanding of the group because 
of, for example, completion of the task, members leaving the organisation or moving on 
to other tasks. Some members may feel a compelling sense of loss at the end of a major 
or lengthy group project and their return to independence is characterised by sadness and 
anxiety. Managers may need to prepare for future group tasks and engendering team eff ort.   
 Another writer suggests that new groups go through the following fi ve stages: 
 ●  the polite stage; 
 ●  the why are we here, what are we doing stage; 
 ●  the power stage, which dominant person will emerge; 
 ●  the constructive stage when sharing begins; and 
 ●  the unity stage – this often takes weeks, eating together, talking together. 20 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 modern systems of communication, such as email and the increasing use of social media, restrict personal interac-
tion and have only a negative effect on group development, cohesiveness and performance. 
 To what extent do YOU believe this fair comment? How has email or social media affected YOUR experience of group 
membership? 
 Creative leadership and group development 
 In an examination of creative leadership and team eff ectiveness,  Rickards and Moger propose 
a modifi cation to the Tuckman model and suggest a two-barrier model of group development. 
From their empirical studies of small groups and project teams, Rickards and Moger put for-
ward two challenges to the prevailing model of team development: 
  1.  Weak teams posed the question ‘What is happening if a team fails to develop beyond the 
storm stage?’. 
  2.   The exceptional teams posed the question ‘What happens if a team breaks out of the per-
formance norms developed?’. 
 The suggestion is that teams are diff erentiated by two barriers to performance. The weak 
barrier is behavioural and defeated a minority of teams; the strong barrier was a block to 

282
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
creativity or innovation, and defeated the majority of those teams who passed through the 
weak barrier. The two-barrier model provides a starting point for exploring the impact and 
influence of a team leader on the performance of teams. Rickards and Moger identified seven 
factors through which a leader might influence effective team development:
● building a platform of understanding;
● creating a shared vision;
● providing a creative climate;
● showing a commitment to idea ownership;
● resilience to setbacks;
● developing networking skills;
● learning from experience.21
Social identity theory
Within work organisations there will be a number of different but overlapping groups repre-
senting a variety of functions, departments, occupations, technologies, project teams, loca-
tions or hierarchical levels. Organisational effectiveness will be dependent upon the extent to 
which these groups co-operate, but often the different groupings are part of a network of com-
plex relationships resulting in competitiveness and conflict. A feature of the importance and 
significance of group membership is the concept of social identity theory. Tajfel and Turner 
originally developed the idea of social identity theory as a means of understanding the psycho-
logical basis of inter-group discrimination.22 Individuals are perceived as having not just one 
‘personal self’ but a number of ‘selves’ derived from different social contexts and membership 
of groups.
Because of the need for a clear sense of personal identity, the groups or social categories 
with which we associate are an integral part of our self-concept (social identity). A natural 
process of human interaction is social categorisation, by which we classify both ourselves 
and other people through reference to our own social identity. For example, membership of 
high-status groups can increase a person’s perceived self-esteem. According to Guirdham, 
‘self-categorisation is the process that transforms a number of individuals into a group’.23 See 
Figure 8.5.
Haslam refers to the relationship between individuals and groups in an understanding of 
organisational behaviour, and argues that:
in order to understand perception and interaction in organizational contexts we must do 
more than just study the psychology of individuals as individuals. Instead, we need to under-
stand how social interaction is bound up with individuals’ social identities – their definition of 
themselves in terms of group memberships.24
Identification with social groupings
We identify ourselves in terms of membership of certain social groupings and differentiate 
ourselves from other social groupings. This leads to minimising differences between mem-
bers of our own groupings (in-groups) and maximising differences from other groupings (out-
groups). Over time the sense of shared identity with the in-group increases a feeling of what 
is right and proper and highlights differences from the out-groups.25 As a result, this reinforces 
both social identity with our own category and the projection of negative perceptions and 
stereotypes towards out-groups.
Stereotyping can lead to shared attitudes to out-groups and to increased conflict among 
work groups. The examples of group stereotyping (discussed in Chapter 6) are associated with 
social identity theory. Tajfel and Turner suggest that the mere act of individuals categorising 
themselves as group members leads them to exhibit in-group favouritism. Hewstone et al. 

Chapter 8  Working in groups and teams
283
suggest that, even without realising it, we tend usually to favour the groupings we belong to 
more than denigrate out-groups. Successful inter-group bias enhances self-esteem.26 (See also 
the discussion on social exchange theory in Chapter 1 and possible effects on group member-
ship, norms and control.)
Characteristics of an effective work group
The characteristics of an effective work group are not always easy to isolate clearly. The under-
lying feature is a spirit of co-operation in which members work well together as a united team 
and with harmonious and supportive relationships. This may be evidenced when members of 
a group exhibit:
● belief in shared aims and objectives;
● sense of commitment to the group;
● acceptance of group values and norms;
● feeling of mutual trust and dependency;
● full participation by all members and decision-making by consensus;
● free flow of information and communications;
● open expression of feelings and disagreements;
● resolution of conflict by the members themselves;
● lower level of staff turnover, absenteeism, accidents, errors and complaints.

part 3 groups, LeadersHip and management
 However, as  Brooks points out, as teams operate at the higher order of group dynamics this 
list is arguably more refl ective of ‘eff ective  work teams rather than work groups and this is how 
it should be – these are teams not groups’. 27 
 Musical ensembles make for an interesting study. Individual members may be brilliant 
soloists and often noted for their temperament, but their performance is as much about the 
total blend and working noticeably well together as about musical ability. By comparison, it is 
noticeable how managers of sporting teams often deliberately introduce new players, even to 
a successful team, in order to further increase competition or rivalry for places, with the hope 
of achieving even greater success for the team as a whole. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 to gain a greater appreciation of effective teamwork, attention should be given in the classroom to the management 
and functioning of successful musical ensembles and successful sports teams. 
 To what extent do YOU believe an understanding of musical ensembles or sports teams relates in a meaningful way 
to the work organisation? 
 Potential disadvantages of strong, 
cohesive groups 
 If the manager is to develop eff ective work groups, attention should be given to those factors 
that infl uence the creation of group identity and cohesiveness. This may result in greater inter-
action between members, mutual help and social satisfaction, lower turnover and absenteeism, 
and often higher production.  28   However, strong and cohesive groups also present potential 
disadvantages for management. Working in groups may result in members spending too much 
time talking among themselves. Cohesive groups do not necessarily produce a higher level of 
output. It may be remembered that in the bank wiring room experiment of the Hawthorne 
studies the level of output was restricted to a standard acceptable as a norm by the group. 
 Once a group has become fully developed, created cohesiveness and established its own cul-
ture, it is more diffi  cult for the manager successfully to change attitudes and behaviour of the 
group. It is important that the manager attempts to infl uence the group during the norming 
stage, when members are establishing their own guidelines and standards and their own norms 
of acceptable behaviour. 
 Inter-group confl ict 
 Strong, cohesive groups may develop a critical or even hostile attitude towards people outside 
the group or members of other groups. Groups may also compete against each other in a 
non-productive manner. This can be the case, for example, when group cohesiveness is based 
on common status, qualifi cations, technical expertise or professional standing. As a result, 
resentment and inter-group confl ict may arise to the detriment of the organisation as a whole. 
 (Recall the discussion on social identity theory, above.) In order to help prevent, or overcome, 
unconstructive inter-group confl ict, the manager should attempt to stimulate a high level of 
communication and interaction between groups. 
 Yet, inter-group rivalry may be deliberately encouraged as a means of building stronger 
within-group cohesiveness. The idea is that a competitive element may help to promote unity 
within a group. However, inter-group rivalry and competition need to be handled carefully 

Chapter 8  Working in groups and teams
285
to avoid development of ‘win–lose’ situations. Emphasis should be placed on overall objec-
tives of the organisation and superordinate goals. These are goals over and above the issues 
at conflict and which, if they are to be achieved, require the co-operation of the competing 
groups.
Virtual teams
The combination of increasing globalisation, competition and widespread developments in 
ICT has given greater emphasis to the opportunities for, and need of, virtual teams. Instead 
of involving face-to-face proximity, virtual teams are a collection of people who are geo-
graphically separated but still need to work together closely. The primary interaction among 
members is by some electronic information and communication process. This enables organ-
isations to function away from traditional working hours and the physical availability of 
staff. Computer-based information systems and increased wireless connectivity further the 
opportunities for virtual working. By their very nature, virtual teams are likely to be largely 
self-managed.
According to Hall, the virtual team is a potential future compromise between fully fledged 
teams and well-managed groups.
I am watching the rise of this idea with interest but am sceptical that it will actually create a 
‘third way’. Real teams can only be forged in the crucible of personal interaction: videocon-
ferences and Net communications are still poor substitutes for this. Of course, once a team 
has formed it can use these media, as members will know each other well, but that’s not the 
important bit. It’s the forming, norming and storming that make a team.29
Virtual teams may lead to an increase in productivity through a reduction in commute time 
and greater personal flexibility. Organisations are able to establish a greater worldwide pres-
ence. Virtual teams can comprise people with different types of knowledge, help to reduce 
discrimination and provide wider employment opportunities. A potential difficulty is main-
taining effective communications, bearing in mind the lack of body language and non-verbal 
communication (discussed in Chapter 6). Virtual teams demand good leadership and manage-
ment, including competence in ICT. Virtual working is not always to the initial liking of all 
people and it is important to have a remote working strategy.
Some people seem clearly to welcome virtual working with its feeling of autonomy, free-
dom from distractions and interruptions and less time and stress on commuting. However, 
despite the increase in remote working, it does not appeal to everyone. Not everyone enjoys 
working on their own and they miss group membership, social structure, contact and interac-
tion. They may feel ignored by the organisation and experience an increasing feeling of isola-
tion. For some people, trust is difficult when they cannot see the other person. Without direct 
personal interaction some people find it difficult to motivate themselves. A sense of discipline 
and self-motivation is important for effective remote working.
Leadership and motivation
Symons considers that one advantage of virtual teamworking is the clarity and richness of 
contributions when respondents are removed from the urgency of immediate interaction, and 
that this can be particularly relevant in cross-cultural groups. However, as the leader can-
not influence by physical presence, and as hierarchies fade online, managing dispersed teams 
requires a range of subtly different leadership skills. It is important to develop mutual trust 
and a democratic approach of shared control and decision-making, and adopt the role and 
style of a coach: ‘The leader has to establish and maintain “credit” with the group, as “posi-
tion power” has little or no currency in virtual working.’30

286
part 3 groups, LeadersHip and management
 Garrett  maintains that collaborating with other people in diff erent cities or countries is not 
always a successful arrangement and lists the following suggestions for helping to organise the 
virtual team: 
 ●  Say hello – The most successful teams spend time during their formation period face to 
face, getting to know each other. 
 ●  Build trust – This holds the team together so that you can depend on other team members 
and feel comfortable opening up to them. 
 ●  Recruit with care – People who can communicate in the right way at the right time are more 
likely to be successful in virtual teams. 
 ●  Do not rely on email  – The written word is easily misunderstood so supplement its use with 
other forms of communication. 
 ●  Encourage dissent – Without face-to-face meetings people become reluctant to speak out, 
but a healthy organisation needs people to speak out and challenge leaders and each other. 
 ●  Use technology thoughtfully – Used badly, sophisticated tools can be a disaster, and people 
need to be trained to use the technology, not simply have it imposed on them. 
 ●  Measure outcomes – Focus on the outcomes rather than time management, fi nd a personal 
way to appraise performance, rather than email, and hold regular chats with members. 
 ●  Do say – ‘By proactively creating virtual teams we can go where talent is, extend our reach 
and work more effi  ciently.’ 
 ●  Do not say – ‘We call them a virtual team because they’re not quite the real thing.’ 31 
 Cultural diversity 
 One reason for the growth in virtual teams is increasing globalisation and team members 
working and living in diff erent countries. This gives rise to potential diffi  culties of cultural 
diversity. As  Francesco and Gold point out: 
 The more culturally diverse the members, the more diﬃ  cult it is to manage a virtual team. 
Cultural diversity, which will be increasingly common, adds to the complexity of managing 
virtual teams because diff erent values, customs, and traditions require more leadership under 
conditions that reduce the ability to use direct leadership. 32 
 And, according to  Murray, although virtual working presents some unexpected benefi ts, if 
managing diversity in the workplace is a tough task for business leaders, the challenges of 
keeping executives from diff erent backgrounds working together in various parts of the world 
is even more diffi  cult. Virtual working does not eradicate the sort of cultural misunderstand-
ings that can arise in a face-to-face situation. 
  Cultural or behavioural diff erences that can manifest themselves in face-to-face working sit-
uations can be exacerbated in virtual team working, particularly when the group has mem-
bers from diff erent backgrounds. 33 
 Hazlehurst points out that the rise of the virtual organisation is not a universal development. 
 In emerging economies, the oﬃ  ce is still a novelty and young people are clamouring to work in 
them. It may seem hard to understand to westerners with generations of travel-weary commuters 
in their family tree, but if you are the fi rst person in your family to move from a village to a city, an 
oﬃ  ce job is alive with exciting possibilities, as well as being a potent symbol of personal success. 34 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 With continuing globalisation and advances in iCt, the days of people spending most of their time working together 
in physical contact with colleagues are gone. global virtual teams are the way forward. 
 How far do YOU agree? What difficulties and problems do YOU foresee? Are YOU concerned about the prospect of 
virtual teamworking?

287
 Role structure of the organisation 
 In order for the organisation to achieve its goals and objectives, the work of individual mem-
bers must be linked into coherent patterns of activities and relationships. This is achieved 
through the ‘role structure’ of the organisation. 
 A  role is the expected pattern of behaviours associated with members occupying a particu-
lar position within the structure of the organisation. It also describes how a person perceives 
their own situation. The concept of role diff erentiation helps to clarify structure and defi ne the 
pattern of complex relationships within the group. 
 The role, or roles, that the individual plays within the group is infl uenced by a combination of: 
 ●  situational factors such as the requirements of the task, nature of technology employed, 
time scales, style of leadership, position in the communication network; and 
 ●  personal factors such as values, culture, attitudes, motivation, ability and personality. 
 
 Management and organisational behaviour in action case study 
 Remote teamworking 
 Joanne Mooney, Customer Journey and online experience manager, British gas, based in stockport, 
and her boss,  Lucy Shadholt,  Head of Channel development for British gas new energy, based in 
staines 
 in the two years she’s been working remotely for British gas, Joanne mooney has enjoyed the fl exibility and 
greater access to her young family, and feels she mostly gets the balance right. 
 You have to know when to switch off . At home, defi ne your space, defi ne your roles in the house, be disciplined in 
your working day, when it starts and stops. It’s not always fair to the family – they know mummy’s working, so they 
have to talk in hushed tones and that seems restrictive to them in their own home. 
 she had managed a call centre of 150 people and sometimes misses the banter: ‘When i started, i was 100% 
working from home. i prefer the mix of the new role, where i’m getting out and meeting people. it’s easier to build 
the relationship over the phone if you’ve met the person.’ 
 Lucy shadbolt is mooney’s boss. since taking on the role in october she has built a team of ten, all of whom work 
at least part of the time remotely, including herself. ‘it suits me; i get so much more done. the whole team love it,’ she 
says. shadbolt runs weekly meetings from the staines offi  ce and is in regular contact with each team member. ‘some 
things are not suitable for conference calls. if i have to have a diffi  cult conversation it needs to be face to face.’ she’s 
confi dent she’s getting good performance from each of them: 
 You have to trust them. I make it clear with new team members that working from home is a privilege. If you give 
clear objectives it’s easy to monitor output. People don’t work 9 to 5, they work longer. It’s not unusual to send an 
email at 10 pm. Work is where your laptop is. 
 shadbolt acknowledges some aspects of her own career development are more difficult to achieve at arm’s length – 
such as getting the ear of the boss. ‘When i go into the office, where we hot-desk, i have to make an effort to position 
myself near my boss. You need to consciously build relationships when you don’t have those water-cooler moments 
naturally occurring.’

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
However, everyone within a group is expected to behave in a particular manner and to fulfil 
certain role expectations. The formal organisational relationships (line, functional, staff or 
lateral) – discussed in Chapter 11 – can be seen as forms of role relationships that determine 
the pattern of interaction with other roles.
A person’s role set
In addition to the role relationships with members of their own group – peers, superiors, 
subordinates – the individual will have a number of role-related relationships with outsiders, 
for example members of other work groups, trade union officials, suppliers, consumers. This 
is a person’s role set. The role set comprises the range of associations or contacts with whom 
the individual has meaningful interactions in connection with the performance of the role (see 
Figure 8.6).
Role incongruence
An important feature of role relationship is the concept of role incongruence. This arises 
when a member of staff is perceived as having a high and responsible position in one respect 
but a low standing in another respect. Difficulties with role incongruence can arise from the 
nature of groupings and formal relationships within the structure of the organisation. There 
are a number of work-related relationships, such as doctor and nurse, chef and waiter, senior 
manager and personal assistant, which can give rise to a potential imbalance of authority and 
responsibility.
Difficulties with role incongruence can also arise in line-staff relationships: for instance, 
a relatively junior member of the HR department informing a senior departmental manager 
that a certain proposed action is contrary to the policies of the organisation. Another example 
with staff relationships is where a person establishes themselves in the role of ‘gatekeeper’ to 
the boss35 – for instance, where a comparatively junior personal assistant passes on the man-
ager’s instructions to one of the manager’s more senior subordinates.
Figure 8.6  Representation of a possible role set in the work situation

Chapter 8 Working in groups and teams
289
 Role expectations 
 Many  role expectations are prescribed formally and indicate what the person is expected to 
do, their duties and obligations, and provide guidelines for expected behaviours. Examples are 
written contracts of employment, rules and regulations, standing orders, policy decisions, job 
descriptions, or directives from superiors. Formal role expectations may also be derived clearly 
from the nature of the task. They may, in part at least, be defi ned legally: for example, under 
Health and Safety at Work legislation; obligations of a company secretary under the Compa-
nies Acts; or responsibilities of a district auditor under the Local Government Acts. 
 Not all role expectations are prescribed formally, however. There will be certain patterns 
of behaviour which, although not specifi ed formally, will nonetheless be expected of mem-
bers. These informal role expectations may be imposed by the group itself, or at least com-
municated to a person by other members of the group. Examples include general conduct, 
mutual support to co-members, attitudes towards superiors, means of communicating, dress 
and appearance. Members may not always be consciously aware of these informal expecta-
tions, yet they still serve as important determinants of behaviour. Under this heading could be 
included the concept of a psychological contract  (discussed in  Chapter  1 ). 
 Self-established roles 
 Some members may have the opportunity to determine largely their own role expectations, 
where, for example, formal expectations are specifi ed loosely or only in very general terms. 
Opportunities for  self-established roles are more likely in senior positions, but also occur 
within certain professional, technical or scientifi c groups, for example senior research staff , or 
where there is a demand for creativity or artistic fl air, for example head chefs. Such opportuni-
ties may be greater within an ‘organic’ organisation and will also be infl uenced by the style of 
leadership adopted – for example, where a laissez-faire approach is adopted. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 despite apparent advantages of group working, the reality is that most people prefer the freedom of working on 
their own. individuals have varying and often conflicting expectations of the benefits from group membership and 
this distracts from effective work performance. 
 To what extent do YOU feel this is a valid contention? Would YOU really prefer working on your own? 
 Role confl ict 
 Patterns of behaviour result from both the person’s role and personality. The concept of role 
focuses attention on aspects of behaviour existing independently of an individual’s personal-
ity.  Role confl ict arises from inadequate or inappropriate role defi nition and needs to be dis-
tinguished from personality clashes. These arise from incompatibility between two or more 
people as individuals, even though their roles may be defi ned clearly and understood fully. 
In practice, the manner in which a person actually behaves may not be consistent with their 
expected pattern of behaviours. This inconsistency may be a result of role confl ict. Role con-
fl ict as a generic term can include: 
 ●  role incompatibility 
 ●  role ambiguity 
 ●  role overload 
 ●  role underload. 

290
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
These are all problem areas associated with the creation of role expectations (see Figure 8.7).
● Role incompatibility arises when a person faces a situation in which simultaneous different 
or contradictory expectations create conflict or inconsistency. Compliance with one set of 
expectations makes it difficult or impossible to comply with other expectations. A typical 
example concerns the person ‘in the middle’, such as the supervisor or section head, who 
faces opposing expectations from workers and from management. Another example might 
be the situation of a manager who believes in a relaxed, participative style of behaviour but 
whose superior expects a more formal and directive style of behaviour.
● Role ambiguity occurs when there is lack of insufficient information or clarity as to the pre-
cise requirements of the role and the person is unsure what to do. The person’s perception 
of their role may differ from the expectations of others. It is likely to arise in large, diverse 
groups or at times of constant change. Uncertainty often relates to such matters as method 
of performing tasks, extent of the person’s authority and responsibility, standards of work, 
time for completion, and evaluation and appraisal of performance.
● Role overload is when a person faces too many separate roles or too great a variety of expecta-
tions. The person is unable to meet satisfactorily all expectations and some must be neglected 
in order to satisfy others. This leads to a conflict of priority and potential stress. Some writers 
distinguish between role overload and work overload. Role overload is seen in terms of the total

Role underload

Chapter 8  Working in groups and teams
291
role set and implies that the person has too many separate roles to handle. Where there are too 
many expectations of a single role – that is, a problem of quantity – this is work overload.
● Role underload can arise when the prescribed role expectations fall short of the person’s 
perception of their role. The person may feel their role is not demanding enough and that 
they have the capacity to undertake a larger or more varied role, or an increased number of 
roles. Role underload may arise, for example, when a new member of staff is first appointed 
or from the initial effects of empowerment.
Role conflict and matrix organisation
Problems of role conflict can often arise from the matrix form of organisation (discussed in 
Chapter 11) and, for example, from the use of flexible project teams. Where staff are assigned 
temporarily, and perhaps on a part-time basis, from other groups this creates a two-way flow 
of authority and responsibility.
Unless role differentiations are defined clearly, this can result in conflicting expectations 
from the manager of the person’s own functional grouping and from the manager of the pro-
ject team (role incompatibility). It can also lead to uncertainty about the exact requirements 
of the part the person is expected to play as a member of the project team (role ambiguity). 
The combinations of expectations from both managers may also result in role overload.
Other influences on behaviour
Even if there is an absence of role conflict and role stress, a person’s actual behaviour may still 
be inconsistent with their expected pattern of behaviours. Miner gives three reasons that may 
account for this disparity:
● The person does not perceive their job in the way the role prescriptions specify. This is a 
form of role ambiguity but may arise not because the role prescriptions themselves are 
unclear, but because the person misunderstands or distorts them.
● Motivation is lacking and the person does not want to behave in the way prescribed.
● The person does not have the capabilities – knowledge, mental ability or physical skills – 
required to behave in the way the role prescriptions specify.36
Application of sanctions
Organisations apply a number of both positive and negative sanctions as inducements for 
members to contribute and behave in accordance with their prescribed roles. Typical examples 
are: an increase in salary or wages; promotion; upgrading to the latest equipment or technol-
ogy; a sideways or downwards move in the organisation structure; and the threat of dismissal. 
There are also a number of less direct sanctions that may be adopted. These include the size 
of office or work area, the allocation of unpopular tasks, giving opportunities for paid over-
time work, priority for holiday rotas, level of supervision or empowerment, the amount of 
information given or the extent of consultation and granting or withholding privileges. Role 
sanctions may also be applied through the operation of the informal organisation. Members 
of the group may impose their own sanctions and discipline individuals who contravene the 
norms of the group or expected standards of behaviour.
Interactions among members
Whatever an individual’s role within the structure of an organisation, if groups are to be suc-
cessful and perform effectively, there must be a spirit of unity and co-operation. As Crainer 
reminds us, in most teams people will contribute individual skills, many of which will be dif-
ferent. However, referring to the work of Obeng,37 Crainer points out that it is not enough to 
have a rag-bag collection of individual skills.

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
The various behaviours of the team members must mesh together in order to achieve objec-
tives. For people to work successfully in teams, you need people to behave in certain ways. 
You need some people to concentrate on the task at hand (doers). You need some people to 
provide specialist knowledge (knowers) and some to solve problems as they arise (solvers). You 
need some people to make sure that it is going as well as it can and that the whole team is 
contributing fully (checkers). And you need some people to make sure that the team is operat-
ing as a cohesive social unit (carers).38
Individual team roles
One of the most popular analyses of individual roles within a work group or team is 
that developed by Belbin, who concludes that groups composed entirely of clever people, 
or of people with similar personalities, display a number of negative results and lack 
creativity. The most consistently successful groups comprise a range of roles undertaken 
by various members. The constitution of the group itself is an important variable in its 
success.39
A team role is a pattern of behaviour, characteristic of the way in which one team mem-
ber interacts with another whose performance serves to facilitate the progress of the team as 
a whole.40 Strength of contribution in any one role is commonly associated with particular 
weaknesses. These are called allowable weaknesses. Members are seldom strong in all nine 
team roles. A description of the evolved nine team roles is given in Table 8.1.

Table 8.1  Belbin’s evolved nine team roles

Chapter 8 Working in groups and teams
293
 An extensive study by  Aritzeta et al. points to a number of critical assessments of Belbin’s 
work, such as: 
 ●  concerns about the theoretical basis of the inventory; 
 ●  questions concerning the relationship between the role of personality and team roles; 
 ●  lack of clear diff erentiation among the nine team roles; 
 ●  insuffi  cient account of the type of task undertaken by the group; 
 ●  infl uence of organisational factors such as strategy, resources, structure, leadership and 
management style; 
 ●  a dominant psychological approach to understanding teamwork that needs to be comple-
mented by socio-technical considerations 
 However, despite negative criticisms the authors do not think it justifi able to suggest the team-
role theory is fl awed. While evidence is mixed they conclude, on balance, that the model and 
accompanying inventory have adequate convergent validity. 41 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the study of evolved team roles has little practical value. Behaviour does not fit into neat categories and most people 
do not acknowledge allowable weaknesses. the two most important roles for effective teamwork are a competent, 
decisive and fair leader, and a humourist to make people laugh and reduce tension. 
 What is YOUR honest opinion of this contention? How would YOU explain your role as a team member? 
 Analysis of individual behaviour 
 In order to understand and to infl uence the functioning and operation of a group or team, 
it is necessary to study patterns of interaction and the parts played by individual members. 
Not all skilled and capable individuals are necessarily good team players and, for example, it 
may sometimes be an advantage to have someone with a more sceptical attitude and open to 
change. The basic assumption behind the analysis of individual behaviour in groups is from 
the viewpoint of its function. 
 A popular classifi cation of member roles in the study of group behaviour is that devised 
originally by  Benne and Sheats. 42 The description of member roles performed in well-func-
tioning groups is classifi ed into three broad headings: group task roles, group building and 
maintenance roles, and individual roles. 
 ●  Group task roles –  These assume that the task of the group is to select, defi ne and solve 
common problems. For example, initiator–contributor, opinion seeker, co-ordinator, evalu-
ator, recorder. 
 ●  Group building and maintenance roles  – The analysis of member functions is orientated 
towards activities that build group-centred attitudes or maintain group-centred behaviour. 
For example, encourager, gatekeeper, standard setter, group commentator. 
 ●  Individual roles – These are directed towards the satisfaction of personal needs. Their pur-
pose is not related either to group task or to the group functioning. For example, aggressor, 
blocker, dominator, help-seeker. 
 Sociometry 
 Originally developed by  Moreno in 1953,  sociometry is a method of indicating the feelings 
of acceptance or rejection among members of a group. 43 The basis of sociometry is usually 
‘buddy rating’ or ‘peer rating’. Each member is asked to nominate or to rate, privately, other 

294
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
members in terms of some given context or characteristic – for example, with whom they com-
municate, or how influential or how likeable they are. Questions may relate to either work or 
social activities. For example:
● Who would you most prefer or least prefer to work with closely?
● Who would make a good leader?
● With whom would you choose and not choose to have a drink in the pub or to go on 
holiday?
Positive and negative choices may be recorded for each person, although sometimes positive 
choices only are required. Sometimes individuals may be asked to rank their choices.
A sociogram is a diagrammatical illustration of the pattern of interpersonal relationships 
derived from sociometry and depicts choices, preferences, likes or dislikes and interactions 
between individual members. An advantage of a diagrammatical illustration is that it can also 
display a visual description of the structure of the group. It can indicate cliques and sub-
groups, compatibility, and members who are popular, isolated or who act as links. Figure 8.8 
gives a simple illustration of an actual sociogram for a group of fifteen members with single, 
positive choices only.
	1.	 G and M are popular (the stars) and most often chosen by members.
	2.	 M is the link between two overlapping cliques, KML and MNO.
	3.	 H and P are unpopular (isolated) and chosen least by members.
	4.	 JKMO is a chain.
	5.	 ABCD is a sub-group and separated from the rest of the members.
There are several methods of compiling and drawing sociograms, and a number of poten-
tial criticisms and limitations. Problems also arise over how to draw the sociogram and how 
to interpret the roles of individual members. However, if handled sensitively it can serve to 
encourage meaningful discussions on patterns of social interactions, group behaviour and the 
perceptions of individual members towards each other. This can serve as a useful basis for the 
development of both employability and wider social skills.
Self-insight and the Johari window
A simple framework for looking at self-insight is the Johari window44 (see Figure 8.9). This 
classifies behaviour in matrix form between what is known–unknown to self and what is 
known–unknown to others in order to encourage a reduction of the individual’s ‘hidden’ 
behaviour through self-disclosure and of the ‘blind’ behaviour through feedback from others.
● Hidden behaviour is that which the individual wishes to conceal from, or not to communi-
cate to, other group members. It is part of the private self. An important role of the group is 
to establish whether members conceal too much, or too little, about themselves from other 
members.
Figure 8.8  A simple illustration of a sociogram

Chapter 8  Working in groups and teams
295
● The blind area (i.e. behaviour known to others but unknown to self) includes mannerisms, 
gestures and tone of voice, and represents behaviour of the impact on others of which the 
individual is unaware. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘bad breath’ area.
Members must establish an atmosphere of openness and trust in order that hidden and blind 
behaviours are reduced and the public behaviour enhanced. (Recall also the comment in 
­Chapter 4 on making public people’s private attitudes.)
Balance between team and individual
Group performance and the satisfaction derived by individuals are influenced by the interac-
tions among members of the group. Individuals in groups interact extensively with each other 
and with other groups in the organisation. Although everyone operates fundamentally as a 
loner at work, James draws attention to the need in most jobs for teamworking.
Effective teams need equilibrium, no matter how uneasy. The perfect team will have 
balance, with each member aware of their role and happy to add that value to the task. 
The natural leaders for any given job will be in charge and their leadership will be cher-
ished by mutual consent. Being a perfect team member means commitment to the task 
and overrides personal ambition and glory. Unfortunately this is rarely achieved in the 
workplace.45
Working in a group is likely to be both a psychologically rewarding and a potentially 
demanding experience for the individual. As an example of this, Figure 8.10 gives an unso-
licited commentary from five final-year business studies degree students after completing a 
group-based assignment.
Friendships and relationships at work
Increasing attention has been given to the possible effects of friendships and relationships at 
work, and potential conflict between personal freedom and team performance. While work 
may be one of the best sources of friends as well as the most desirable place to have them, the 
trouble is that friendships at work are full of ambiguities. For friendships, the trouble with 
work is that you are there to be useful: to do something for a client, team or boss. ­Professional 
friendships will always be influenced and possibly determined by the utility factor.46 Romance 
in the workplace presents managers with an interesting problem: ‘On the one hand, you 
seek to shape a team with close bonds; a degree of flirtation may well accompany, even pro-
mote this. On the other; an ill-starred liaison that jeopardises harmony and risks litigation is 
emphatically to be avoided’.47

 Individual compared with group or 
team performance 
 Despite apparent advantages of group working, it is diffi  cult to draw any fi rm conclusions from 
a comparison between individual and group or team performance. Group decision-making 
can be frustrating and stressful as well as costly and time consuming. According to  Hall, there 
is a danger of elevating teams into a ‘silver bullet’ – a magic solution to all business problems. 
  It is not that I don’t think teams work. They clearly do and it would be diﬃ  cult to run an 
organisation of any size if you couldn’t create and manage a team . . . The truth is that 
teams are not always the right answer to a problem. Often a well-briefed and well-managed 
group of individuals will do a task fi ne . . . A further point is that some very skilled individu-
als are not good team players. 48 
 However, the general feeling appears to be that the collective power of a group outshines indi-
vidual performance. 49 ‘Even though individuals working on their own are capable of phenomenal

ingenuity, working together as a team can produce astounding results and a better decision.’50 
Guirdham believes that: ‘Compared with individuals, groups can make objectively better deci-
sions to which people feel more commitment, while teams can perform functions and carry out 
projects better and more efficiently. This can only happen, however, if the people have the special 
skills and abilities needed.’51
One might expect, therefore, a higher standard of decision-making to result from group 
discussion. There are, however, particular features of individual versus team performance, 
including:
● social loafing
● risky-shift phenomenon
● groupthink
● brainstorming.
Social loafing
The concept of social loafing (or the Ringelmann effect) is the tendency for individual mem-
bers of a group to expend less effort than if they were working on their own. A German psy-
chologist, Maximilien Ringelmann, compared results of individual and group performance on 
a rope-pulling task. Workers were asked to pull as hard as they could on a rope, performing 
the task first individually and then with others in groups of varying size. A meter measured 
the strength of each pull. Although the total amount of force did increase with the size of the 
work group, the effort expended by each individual member decreased with the result that the 
total group effort was less than the expected sum of the individual contributions.52 Replications 
of the Ringelmann effect have generally been supportive of the original findings.53
The risky-shift phenomenon
This suggests that instead of the group taking fewer risks and making safer or more conserva-
tive decisions, the reverse is often the case. Pressures for conformity mean there is a tendency 
for groups to make more risky decisions than would individual members of the group on their 
own. People are arguably less averse to risk when there is an emotional bond with others in the 
group. Studies suggest that people working in groups generally advocate more risky alterna-
tives than if they were making an individual decision on the same problem.54 Presumably, this 
is because members do not feel the same sense of responsibility for group decisions or their 
outcomes: ‘A decision which is everyone’s is the responsibility of no one.’
Other explanations offered for the risky-shift phenomenon include the following:
● People inclined to take risks are more influential in group discussions than more conserva-
tive people.
● Risk-taking is regarded as a desirable cultural characteristic that is more likely to be 
expressed in a social situation such as group working.55
However, groups do appear to work well in the evaluation of ideas and to be more effec-
tive than individuals for problem-solving tasks requiring a range of knowledge and expertise. 
From a review of the research, Shaw suggests that evidence supports the view that groups 
produce more solutions and better solutions to problems than do individuals.56
‘Groupthink’
The effectiveness of group behaviour and performance can be adversely affected by the idea 
of groupthink. From an examination of some well-known government policy-making groups, 
Janis concluded that decisions can be characterised by groupthink, which he defines as ‘a 

298
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment that results from in-
group pressures’.57 Groupthink results in the propensity for the group just to drift along. It 
is a generalised feature and can be apparent in any organisational situation where groups are 
relied upon to make important decisions.
Janis identifies a number of specific symptoms of groupthink, including: an illusion of 
invulnerability; discrediting of negative feedback that contradicts group consensus; an unques-
tioned belief in the inherent morality of the group; negative stereotyping of opponents or peo-
ple outside the group, or to the acceptance of change; and pressure on individual members to 
conform and reach consensus so that minority or unpopular ideas may be suppressed.
Brainstorming
A brainstorming approach (sometimes referred to as thought showers or ‘cloud bursting’ in 
order not to offend people with conditions such as epilepsy) involves a group of between six 
and ten members adopting a ‘freewheeling’ attitude and generating as many ideas as possible, 
the more wild or apparently far-fetched, the better.58As an illustrative exercise a group may be 
asked to generate as many and varied possible uses as they can for, for example, a man or wom-
an’s leather belt. Brainstorming is based on encouraging members to suspend judgement, the 
assumption that creative thinking is achieved best by encouraging the natural inclinations of 
group members, and free association of ideas. The quantity of ideas will lead to quality of ideas.
There are a number of basic procedures for brainstorming:
● Maximum freedom of expression with a totally relaxed and informal approach. Members 
are encouraged to elaborate or build on ideas expressed by others and to bounce sugges-
tions off one another.
● Initial emphasis is on the quantity of ideas generated, not the quality of ideas. No individ-
ual ideas are criticised or rejected at this stage, however wild or fanciful they may appear.
● Need for good reporting of all the ideas either in writing and/or by tape or video recording.
An interesting and popular exercise to help illustrate the suspension of initial perceived barri-
ers and the encouragement of creative thinking is given in Figure 8.11. This exercise may also 
be used to compare individual and group/team-based performance. Your tutor will provide an 
answer. There may be others that the author is unaware of!
One might reasonably expect that members of a brainstorming group would produce more 
creative problem-solving ideas than if the same members worked alone as individuals. Avail-
ability of time is an important factor. Over a longer period of time the group may produce 
more ideas through brainstorming than individuals could. Perhaps surprisingly, there appears 
to be doubt about the effectiveness of brainstorming groups over an individual working under 
the same conditions. However, any procedure that aids the process of creativity (discussed in 
Chapter 5) should be welcomed, and there are a number of potential positive achievements in 
terms of related structural techniques for stimulating innovation.

Building effective teams
Whatever the debate about individual and group or team performance, effective teamworking 
is of increasing importance in modern organisations. The Chartered Management Institute 
points out that teams can play a key role in organisational success, but the development of 
good working relationships is vital to team performance.
A team is more than just a group of people who happen to work together. It is a group of 
people working towards common goals and objectives and sharing responsibility for the out-
comes. Team building is the process of selecting and grouping team members effectively and 
developing good working relationships and practices enabling the team to steer and develop 
the work and reach their goals. Increasingly, a team may be composed of people drawn from 
different functions, departments and disciplines who have been brought together for a spe-
cific project.59
Yukl refers to the purpose of team building as being to increase cohesiveness, mutual co-operation, 
and identification with the group. Based on research, theory and practice, Yukl identifies eight 
team-building procedures:
● Emphasise common interests and values – collective identification is stronger when mem-
bers agree about objectives, values, priorities, strategies and the need for co-operation.
● Use ceremonies and rituals – to increase identification with the group and make member-
ship appear special. The use of rituals for initiation and retirement, and ceremonies for 
special occasions or events.
● Use symbols to develop identification with the group – such as team name, logo, insignia, 
emblem or particular colour to help create a special identity for the team.
● Encourage and facilitate social interaction – development of a cohesive group is more likely 
when members get to know each other on a personal basis and find social interactions 
satisfying.
● Tell people about group activities and achievements – keeping members informed about 
the plans, activities and achievements and how their work contributes to the success of the 
mission.
● Conduct process analysis sessions – frank and open discussions of interpersonal relation-
ships and group processes, including suggestions on how to improve effectiveness.
● Conduct alignment sessions – to increase mutual understanding among team members and 
to overcome negative stereotypes and attributions.
● Increase incentives for mutual co-operation – incentives based not individually but on group 
performance to encourage co-operation, such as bonus based on team performance.60
‘Away days’
Another approach to team building is the use of activity-based exercises undertaken as 
part of corporate bonding, usually referred to as away days. The main objective is often 
the building of team spirit and working relationships involving formal team dynamics and 
assessment, although this may also be linked with a social purpose, for example to develop 
interactions with colleagues, improve motivation or to thank and reward staff. The idea of 
away days is subject to frequent criticism and even ridicule. Individuals may feel pressurised 
into participating for fear of not appearing to support management initiative or their group 
colleagues.
Baroness Kingsmill suggests that of course there is a case to be made for getting away 
from day-to-day routines and pressures and spending time with colleagues: ‘Fostering rela-
tionships, encouraging creativity and innovative thinking and promoting better communi-
cation are all desirable goals. It is just that it is usually done so badly and is often a waste 
of time and resource. Companies spend millions on away-days every year but rarely do 

300

they make much diff erence to the way the business is run.’ A successful away day should be 
small, with perhaps no more than twenty participants, provide an opportunity for wide-
ranging and out-of-the-box thinking and conversation, be accompanied by some social 
activity to foster relationships and, if it involves sleeping away from home, have comfort-
able surroundings. 61  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the nature of the hierarchical structure and inevitable role conflicts, power struggles, politics and personality clashes 
mean that individuals working on their own will usually complete a task more quickly and effectively than a group 
or team. 
 To what extent do YOU think this is fair comment? What has been YOUR own experience? Do YOU prefer to work on 
YOUR own or as a member of a group/team? 
 Skills of successful teamwork 
 How people behave and perform as members of a group is as important as their behaviour 
or performance as individuals. Harmonious working relationships and good teamwork help 
make for a high level of staff  morale and work performance. Teamwork is important in any 
organisation but may be especially signifi cant in emergency and caring industries or ser-
vice industries such as hospitality organisations, where there is a direct eff ect on customer 
satisfaction. 62 
 According to  Guirdham, the growth of teamwork has led to the increased interest in inter-
face skills at work. 
 More and more tasks of contemporary organisations, particularly those in high technology 
and service businesses, require teamwork. Taskforces, project teams and committees are key 
elements in the modern workplace. Teamwork depends not just on technical competence of 
the individuals composing the team, but on their ability to ‘gel’. To work well together, the 
team members must have more than just team spirit. They also need collaborative skills – 
they must be able to support one another and to handle confl ict in such a way that it becomes 
constructive rather than destructive. 63 
 Peeling maintains that to build good teams you need a wide pool of staff  with diff erent 
talents to draw upon. 
 Good managers should delight in the diversity and excellence of their staff  and know that 
one of their main jobs is to manage the problems that come with any diverse group of 
talented people. In any group of talented people you will naturally get interpersonal ten-
sions. It is important that you show you respect all the diff erent skills and personalities in 
your team. 64  
 Autonomous working groups 
 An important development in work redesign and job enrichment is a form of work organisa-
tion based on autonomous work groups (or self-managed work groups) who are encouraged 
to manage their own work and working practices. The group operates without direct supervi-
sion and decides for itself how work should be distributed and carried out. Members of the 
group assume greater autonomy and responsibility for the eff ective performance of the work. 

Chapter 8  Working in groups and teams
301
With greater empowerment the belief is that members will feel more committed to the objec-
tives and operations of the group.
Key features of the self-managed work group include the following:
● Specific goals are set for the group but members decide the best means by which these goals 
are to be achieved and have greater freedom and wider discretion over the planning, execu-
tion and control of their work.
● Collectively members of the group have the necessary variety of expertise and skills to 
undertake the tasks of the group successfully.
● The level of external supervision is reduced and the role of supervisor becomes more one of 
giving advice and support to the group. Feedback and evaluation are related to the perfor-
mance of the group as a whole.
ACAS strongly supports autonomous work groups for both increased competitiveness and for 
the quality of working life.
The concept of autonomous teams may be misleading as teams will always be answerable 
to management and rely on the provision of resources and other support. Nevertheless, 
one of the best ways to ensure that teams continue to develop is to move towards self-
regulation – an important way of monitoring the progress of teams is to assess the level 
of dependence on management. It is for management to encourage progress by helping 
the teams develop greater independence. Reorganising the workforce into teams is not 
easy but when successfully developed, team working has been shown to be a way of 
improving competitiveness and at the same time enhancing the quality of working life for 
employees.65
Autonomous working groups are not free of potential difficulties. With greater independ-
ence there may be a resistance to change and the acceptance of new ideas or responsibilities. 
With less management control internal battles over authority may develop within the group. 
A self-managed group is more likely to establish its own values and norms, including the pace 
of work, that may be at variance with those of the organisation. Developments in ICT and 
the growth of remote teamworking enable individuals to work collaboratively despite physical 
distance.
Skills to build self-managed teams
Cloke and Goldsmith refer to the special skills required for successful teamwork and list ten 
skills team members can develop in order to build innovative self-managing teams. All of these 
skills are interrelated, mutually reinforcing and dependent upon each of the others.66
● Skill of self-management – Overcoming obstacles together, and building a sense of owner-
ship, responsibility, commitment and efficiency within each team member.
● Skill of communication – Collaboratively developing skills in becoming better listeners, 
communicating honestly about things that really matter.
● Skill of leadership – Creating opportunities for each member to be skilled in order to serve 
as leader.
● Skill of responsibility – Personal responsibility not only for their own work but for the 
work of every other member of the team in order to become self-managing.
● Skill of supportive diversity – Allowing team members to overcome prejudices and biases 
and not create winners and losers, reject outsiders or mistrust people who are different.
● Skills of feedback and evaluation – Essential to improving learning, team communication 
and the quality of products, processes and relationships.
● Skill of strategic planning – Identifying challenges and opportunities collaboratively. Think 
long term, be proactive and focus on solutions rather than problems.
● Skill of shaping successful meetings – Team meetings can be streamlined and made shorter, 
more satisfying and more productive, and result in expanded consensus.

302
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
● Skill of resolving conflicts – Encouraging members to improve skills in problem-solving, 
collaborative negotiation, responding to difficult behaviour and conflict resolution.
● Skill of enjoyment – Most team members enjoy working together to accomplish difficult 
tasks, meeting high-performance challenges and producing results that benefit themselves 
and their teams, organisations and communities.
The Margerison ‘Team Wheel’
From work with teams in major oil companies, Charles Margerison concluded that they lacked 
a common teamwork language to deal with team issues or for learning and development. After 
further work with Dick McCann in a range of other organisations, Margerison identified nine 
major skills necessary in every business and team that can improve work contribution. The key 
to the system is the ‘Team Wheel’ (see Figure 8.12).
The nine key factors cover all aspects of teamwork in every organisation. Linking is the 
all-encompassing area of co-ordination, and organisation success depends on how effectively 
members of the team link to achieve objectives:
● Advising – Gathering and reporting information.
● Innovating – Creating and experimenting with ideas.
● Promoting – Exploring and presenting opportunities.
● Developing – Assessing and planning applications.
● Organising – Organising staff and resources.
● Producing – Concluding and delivering output.
● Inspecting – Controlling and auditing contracts and procedures.
● Maintaining – Upholding and safeguarding standards and values.
● Linking – Co-ordinating and integrating the work of others.
The ‘Team Wheel’ can also be used as a focus for reviewing both internal links between each 
member of the team and external linking with other teams and key stakeholders such as 
clients.67

 The role of team leader 
 Building successful teams requires eff ective leadership with an emphasis on trust, clear com-
munications, full participation and self-management: ‘The infl uence and usefulness of team 
leaders comes, not from their delivery of traditional supervisory and control methods, but 
from their ability to lead from the front and in training, coaching and counselling their team 
members to high standards of performance.’ 68 
 In her discussion of the ‘democratic enterprise’ (organisations that can fl ourish economi-
cally and can also be places of excitement and stimulation, fulfi lment and tranquillity), 
 Gratton maintains that it is the leaders of the teams across the organisation who make the 
company vision a reality on a day-to-day basis. The team leaders are the creators of space in 
which choice and freedom can be exercised; they delineate the obligations and accountabili-
ties contained within the business goals; they become role models for how members should 
behave; and they bring the philosophy of autonomy and personal development to realisation 
by the manner in which they act as mentors and coaches. 69 
 According to  Powell, if you want to see the effi  cacy of a leader and his or her leadership 
style, then you need to look no further than the team he or she leads. 
  A team rarely demonstrates more passion or behaves more positively than its leader. Similarly, 
cynical leaders produce, and therefore deserve, cynical teams. Innovative, creative and devel-
opmental leaders help to produce creative, innovative and developed followers. A team that is 
enthusiastic, energetic and innovative will have at its heart a leader who is correspondingly so. 70 
 With the football business as an example,  Brady refers to the importance for any organisa-
tion, especially with a people business, of bringing staff  with you, building a team around you 
and how team ethic leads to success. 
 The reason it works is because of the respect we have for each other. We all know each other’s 
strengths and weaknesses and we work around them. We don’t step into each other’s territo-
ries. We leave each one to each role, but we support them instead. 71 
 Continuous improvement and innovation 
 The requirement for continual development and improvement is a necessary part of eff ective team-
work. The ACAS advisory booklet concludes that although self-regulation is necessary if the poten-
tial of teamworking is to be realised, teams will always need some degree of management direction. 
The task of management is to oversee the development of teams and provide the necessary support 
and training. Even when in place, teams will need constant monitoring and development. Team-
working is not a fi nite project but a process of continuous improvement and innovation. 
  The introduction of team working is a major step for an organisation to take. It is important 
that management, trade unions and employees ensure they know how team working will 
contribute to their business strategy and that it is likely to involve a long-term transforma-
tion . . . The early challenge and excitement of establishing teams may fade and it is easy 
for organisations to accept a level of performance which is short of optimum . . . In order to 
achieve high performance, teams require regular changes and challenges. These may include: 
changes to team personnel; new tasks; re-examining the contribution the team makes to the 
overall business aims; and ensuring that the team has regular dealings with other teams. 72 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 discussion about building successful teams sounds fine in the classroom. But it ignores the reality of the work envi-
ronment, for example managing groups of people in a restaurant kitchen, a production assembly line, a gay pub, an 
orchestra, or professionals such as lecturers. 
 What do YOU think? Give YOUR own examples of the reality of teamworking in a specific environment.

part 3 groups, LeadersHip and management
  1  How would you distinguish between a ‘group’ and a ‘team’? to what extent do you believe the distinction has 
practical signifi cance for managers? 
  2  distinguish between formal and informal groups. explain the importance and infl uence of group values and 
norms and give practical examples from within your own university and/or organisation. 
  3  explain fully the extent to which you prefer working on your own or as part of a group. What benefi ts would you 
expect both to give up and to receive from group membership? 
  4   identify diff erent stages in group development and maturity. What other factors infl uence the cohesiveness of 
work groups? give examples by reference to a work group to which you belong. 
  5  set out in detail the advantages and potential diffi  culties of virtual teams. explain how you believe virtual team-
working is likely to develop in the future. 
  6  What is meant by the role structure of an organisation? Construct a diagram that shows your own role set within 
your university or any work situation. give examples of informal role expectations to which you are, or have 
been, a party. 
 Review and discussion questions 
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  groups are characteristic of all social situations. individuals seldom work in isolation, and 
groups and teams are a major feature of the work organisation. 
  2   the terms ‘groups’ and ‘teams’ are to be used interchangeably. Whereas all teams are groups, it 
does not necessarily follow that all groups are teams. 
  3  Formal groups are concerned with co-ordination of work activities. Within the formal structure 
informal groups develop to satisfy psychological and social needs. 
  4  the manager’s main concern is that members work together as a united, cohesive team with 
supportive relationships and to prevent unconstructive inter-group confl ict. 
  5  Continuing globalisation and developments in iCt have given emphasis to the virtual teams. 
members are geographically separated but still need to work together closely. 
  6  the role structure of the organisation, interactions among members and individual team roles 
are important to an understanding of group processes and behaviour. 
  7   in order to understand and infl uence the working of groups it is necessary to understand pat-
terns of interactions and parts played by individual members. 
  8  Working in groups would appear to off er advantages to performance but it is diffi  cult to draw 
any fi rm conclusion from comparison with individual performance. 
  9   the growth of teamwork has led to increased interest in attention to social skills, competencies 
and leadership in order to build and develop eff ective teams. 
  10  How to behave and perform as members of a group is as important as their actions as indi-
viduals. Continual development and improvement is a necessary part of eff ective teamwork. 

CHAPTER 8 WORKING IN GROUPS AND TEAMS

  7  Discuss critically what you believe could be learnt in the classroom from a study of successful music ensembles 
 and sporting teams. 
  8  Explain fully your understanding of (a) groupthink; (b) the risky-shift phenomenon; and (c) brainstorming. Assess 
critically the likely standard of individual performance compared with group or team performance. 
  9  Discuss potential beneﬁ ts and limitations of team-building exercises including ‘away days’. Where possible relate 
to your own experiences. 
  10  Detail fully what you believe are the essential characteristics of a successful work group or team. As a manager, 
explain how you would attempt to develop eﬀ ective group/team relationships and performance. 
 Assignment 
 Working in small self-selecting teams, you are required to design and present an ‘ice-breaker’ exercise as a fun 
way to help groups of new students (or other new members or delegates) to get to know and interact with 
each other. The exercise should be  simple, easy to understand and undertake, entertaining, something 
to which all members of the team/group can contribute, and that can be completed within thirty 
minutes. 
 Your tutor will be asked to decide which team has come up with the most novel, engaging and appropriate 
exercise. 
 ●  If possible, attempt to employ the chosen exercise in a real-life situation. How successful was the exercise? 
 Objectives 
 Completing this exercise should help you to enhance the following skills: 
 ●  Evaluate the role(s) you play within the team and the contribution you make. 
 ●  Explore your relationships with other members of the team. 
 ●  Receive and give honest feedback about strengths and personal weaknesses. 
 In order to work well with other people you need to know and understand yourself and be prepared to receive hon-
est feedback from your colleagues. The eﬀ ectiveness of a team can be enhanced by a genuine openness among its 
members. 
 Exercise 
 For this exercise, work in pairs with another team member – if possible from a diﬀ erent ethnicity, culture, gender 
or age group. You should both agree to honour conﬁ dentiality and to conduct the exercise as a means of providing 
constructive feedback. 
 Part 1 
 Refer to Belbin’s nine team roles ( Table  8.1 in the text of this chapter) and ask the following question of each other: 
  1  For what role do you think I am most suited – and why? 
 Next refer to the Margerison ‘Team Wheel’ ( Figure  8.12 in the text) and ask the following question of each other: 
  2  In what ways can I contribute more to the work of the team?

 now ask the follow-up questions, below, of each other: 
  1  Which member of the team do you believe i am most close to and which member most distant from? 
  2  What do you see as my major strengths and personal weaknesses as a member of the team? 
  3  What is it about me that you fi nd most annoying? 
  4  in what ways could we help each other in our work? 
  5  How can i be a better all-round member of the team? 
 Discussion 
 after you have both completed these questions, consider carefully and honestly: 
 ●  What have you learned about yourself from this activity? 
 ●  What response from your colleague surprised you the most? 
 ●  to what extent has this exercise helped you to understand how well you work as a team member? put this in writ-
ing as an aid to discipline and for your personal refl ection. 
 in the spring of 2014 the Queen celebrated her 88th 
birthday in the year that also marked the 50th anniver-
sary of the d-day normandy landings during the sec-
ond World War. as part of this event one of the most 
spectacular examples of teams at work was seen – and 
heard – in the skies above London. the nine pilots of 
the royal air Force aerobatic team, better known as the 
red arrows, combine extraordinarily high levels of indi-
vidual skill with strongly disciplined teamwork to mount 
displays that can be breathtaking, in terms of both the 
expertise on show and the balletic quality of the pat-
terns and images that they paint in the air. 
 the full display team comprises nine pilots, and 
many of the manoeuvres that are part of the red arrows 
display involve all of them. However, some of the for-
mations require smaller confi gurations, and the nine are 
divided into two sub-teams: a team of fi ve (reds 1–5) 
called ‘enid’ (named after the enid Blyton characters 
the Famous Five), who fl y at the front of the character-
istic V-formation; and a further team of four (reds 6–9) 
called, for reasons lost in the mists of time, ‘gypo’, who 
fl y at the rear. 73 two members of team gypo (reds 6 
and 7) also fl y as the ‘synchro pair’, undertaking specifi c 
‘opposition’ manoeuvres such as describing patterns of 
loops or hearts in the air using the aircrafts’ smoke trails. 
 the nine pilots of the Hawk t1 jet aircraft are the 
mere tip of the red arrows iceberg. each pilot is accom-
panied to and from displays by their personal fl ight engi-
neer, whose job is to service the aircraft and to ensure 
peak performance during fl ights. these fl ight engineers 
(who are known collectively as the ‘Circus’) work with 
their specifi ed pilots and aircraft throughout the sum-
mer display season. the full technical support team on 
the ground numbers over 100 and is distinguishable by 
its blue overalls, contrasting with the pilots’ red ones. 
among the support team’s number is another special-
ist group, the ‘dye team’ – six personnel who have the 
specifi c responsibility for replenishing the diesel and 
dye mix that the pilots use to create the dramatic red, 
white and blue vapour trails that enhance the displays. 
these trails also serve a technical safety purpose, as they 
help red 1 to judge wind speed and direction, thereby 
ensuring that the display team can adjust to variations 
on the day.

Chapter 8  Working in groups and teams
307
In 2009, Flight Lieutenant Kirsty Moore made his-
tory when she became the first female pilot to join the 
Red Arrows. The selection criteria are very demanding: 
no pilots can even be shortlisted until they have been 
assessed as above average during their flying career, 
have a minimum of 1,500 flying hours’ experience and 
have completed at least one operational tour. But indi-
vidual excellence and celebrity cannot be allowed to get 
in the way of teamwork; as the then Red 1, Wing Com-
mander Jas Hawker, pointed out during an interview 
in 2009:
there’s zero place in the Red Arrows for an egoist even 
though we do get associated with pop-star lifestyle. I 
think if there were big egos around they’d be stamped 
out by the team.74
Building the team
Many of the team’s set pieces look scarily dangerous 
and many an amateur photographer has caught what he 
or she believed to be a near miss on film. The choreog-
raphy often requires the Hawk jets to be very close in 
aeronautical terms and certainly the visual effect of two 
jets apparently hurtling towards each other on collision 
course at 400 mph (640 km/h) can be breathtaking. The 
key to this is, of course, a rigorous and continuous train-
ing programme, the start of which coincides with the 
selection of the next year’s new pilots at the end of the 
display season. Three new recruits will take the places 
of three pilots whose time with the squad is finished; 
and only Red 1 will continue to fly in the same position, 
meaning that all the pilots need to learn new roles in an 
updated formation.
During the period from the end of the display season 
(September/October) to the following February, squad 
members fly three times a day from their HQ at RAF 
Scampton, wearing the normal green flying suits of any 
RAF pilot. They work individually, then in smaller groups 
of three or four, with intensive review using video foot-
age and other debriefing methods to ensure that mis-
takes and errors are corrected. After both practice 
sessions and actual displays, the pilots watch recordings 
of their performance to identify flaws or moments when 
the formation was not as precisely aligned as the leader 
would like. In order to remove the personal aspects of 
criticism that might get in the way of focused analysis, 
the team adopts the simple psychological technique 
of referring to each other as numbers rather than by 
name when reviewing the performance of the mem-
bers.75 By March the nine are ready to begin flying as 
an entire team (starting with their classic formation, the 
‘Diamond Nine’) and the more complex display work 
can be developed.
On the ground
During the months while the nine are consolidating 
their skill in the air, the aircraft themselves also have to 
be thoroughly overhauled. Maintenance and technical 
work is carried out in shifts, starting at 6.30 in the morn-
ing and continuing through to the early hours so that 
enough aircraft are ready for the first training flight of 
the day. Finally, in March, the whole operation moves 
to the RAF base of Akrotiri in Cyprus and the team puts 
the final touches to its programme. When judged suf-
ficiently safe and professional in their performance, the 
nine are given formal permission to display by the Com-
mander-in-Chief (Public Display Authority). Only then 
can they wear the characteristic red and blue overalls in 
recognition of this annual milestone, and as the next set 
of applicants begin their tests, the core team embarks 
on the summer display programme.
In addition to the flight and engineering co-ordina-
tion, the logistics of both training sessions and displays 
demand high levels of organisation and teamwork. Dur-
ing the summer the public display schedule dictates the 
life of the Circus. Technical staff, equipment, fuel and 
other resources must be available as necessary, wherever 
in the world the team is likely to be based for displays. 
This task is carried out by the Display Co-ordination and 
Administration Group and regularly briefed to all staff 
through a detailed schedule called WHAM (What’s Hap-
pening According to the Manager). The image of the 
squadron has to be managed as well, not only to sat-
isfy public interest in the team, but also to ensure that 
it retains popular support in an era of environmental 
concern and government austerity. A small group of RAF 
personnel handles enquiries from the public and press, 
runs the official website and organises publicity around 
the Reds’ appearances. They are sometimes involved in 
charity events and challenges, such as their ‘Jet Pull’ in 
aid of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Asso-
ciation (SSAFA), when teams and individuals from the 
­Circus compete to pull a Hawk T1 50 metres (Joe Tiley, 
one of the Blues, achieved this feat in 1 minute and 
12 seconds in 2013).
Nevertheless, despite the rigorous and thorough 
training and close team co-ordination, very occasion-
ally something goes terribly wrong. Fatalities are rare –  
only ten since the team was founded in 1965 – but 
2011 was a tragic year. Two pilots, Jon Egging and Sean 
Cunningham, died in separate accidents, both of which 
were away from the crowds and neither of which was

the result of a display manoeuvre.76 In March 2010 
there was an incident during pre-season training when 
Reds 6 and 7, the ‘Synchro Pair’, struck each other dur-
ing a practice flight. Red 7 was able to land safely, but 
the pilot of Red 6 had to eject from his plane, sustain-
ing significant injuries to shoulder and knees that put 
him out of action for the 2010 display season. His air-
craft was also seriously damaged; flight training was 
suspended until an accident investigation had been 
completed and the squad cleared to fly again. The 
immediate result for the team was the need, once the 
all-clear had been given, to integrate a new member 
since the majority of the Red Arrows’ stunts require all 
nine aircraft. In this highly structured organisational 
environment the choice of replacement meant the 
recall of a previous Red 6.
In February 2015 Red 1 – David Montenegro – unveiled 
a new livery for the squadron’s tailfins, and explained 
something of the philosophy behind the Arrows’ work:
we aim to inspire young people by giving a tangible 
demonstration of what professionalism, hard work and 
teamwork can achieve – not just in the Armed Forces 
but in whatever career they choose for their future.77
A Red Arrows display is, for many, a blend of sights 
and sounds that is not easily forgotten, and a power-
ful reminder of the possibilities opened up by effective 
teamwork.
 Tasks
	 1	 Explain the importance of group cohesiveness to the Red Arrows. How can cohesiveness be achieved 
when team members are so physically isolated as they train and perform?
	 2	 Analyse the Red Arrows’ yearly programme using Tuckman’s model of group development and relationships. 
Explain how far the schedule reflects the model, and identify key transition points between the five stages.
	 3	 Examine the whole team (including the pilots as well as the engineers and administration staff of the ‘Circus’) 
using Belbin’s model of team roles. Where would you expect to find people with each of the characteristics 
Belbin identifies?
	 4	 What do you think are the particular challenges facing Red 1 as leader of the display team? How might 
concepts outlined in the chapter help the leader understand and manage such challenges?

 Leadership is one of the holy grails of management and organisational behaviour. however complex or nebulous the 
subject area may appear, an understanding of leadership is an essential part of your studies. 
 What benefi ts do YOU expect to achieve from YOUR study of leadership? 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 an essential element of management and organisational behaviour is 
co-ordinating the activities of people and guiding their eff orts towards 
the goals and objectives of the organisation. this involves the process 
of leadership and the choice of an appropriate form of behaviour and 
action. the manager needs to understand the nature and infl uence of 
leadership and factors that determine the eff ectiveness of the leadership 
relationship.

 Leadership in organisations

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
The significance of leadership
The changing nature of work organisations involves moving away from an emphasis on com-
mand and getting results by the close control of the workforce and towards an environment of 
teamwork coaching, support and empowerment. This places an ever-growing importance on 
leadership. The leader–follower relationship is reciprocal, and effective leadership is a two-way 
process that influences both individual and organisational performance. Leadership is related 
to motivation and interpersonal behaviour.1 A CBI report makes the point that: ‘Effective lead-
ers, who can inspire their people to realise their personal and collective potential, are often 
the deciding factor between a company being good at what it does and achieving greatness.’2
Leadership and management
What is the relationship between leadership and management? Although the two terms are 
often used interchangeably, management may be viewed as relating to people working within 
a structured organisation and with prescribed roles, in order to achieve stated organisational 
objectives (see Chapter 10). The emphasis of leadership is on interpersonal behaviour in a 
broader context. It is often associated with the willing and enthusiastic behaviour of followers.
Arguably there are differences between leadership and management. For example, Zaleznik 
explores difference in attitudes towards goals, conceptions of work, relations with others, self-
perception and development:
● Managers tend to adopt impersonal or passive attitudes towards goals. Leaders adopt a 
more personal and active attitude towards goals.
● In order to get people to accept solutions, the manager needs continually to co-ordinate 
and balance in order to compromise conflicting values. The leader creates excitement in 
work and develops choices that give substance to images that excite people.
● In their relationships with other people, managers maintain a low level of emotional 
involvement. Leaders have empathy with other people and give attention to what events and 
actions mean.
● Managers see themselves more as conservators and regulators of the existing order of 
affairs with which they identify and from which they gain rewards. Leaders work in, but do 
not belong to, the organisation. Their sense of identity does not depend upon membership 
or work roles and they search out opportunities for change.3
Summarising the views of scholars who have attempted to differentiate between leading and 
managing, Kent draws attention to the following characteristics:
● managers do things right; leaders do the right things;
● managing is an authority relationship; leading is an influence relationship; and
● managing creates stability; leading creates change.
Kent suggests that although the ideas are provocative and stimulating, they provide a basis for 
a deeper understanding of the dynamics behind the two processes.4
Leadership role not defined
The key point about leadership is that it does not necessarily take place within the hierarchical 
structure of the organisation. It can occur at different levels and be manifested in different ways. 
Many people operate as leaders without their role ever being clearly established or defined.
For example, Belbin suggests that:
there is a clear implication that leadership is not part of the job but a quality that can be 
brought to a job . . . The work that leadership encompasses in the context clearly is not 
assigned but comes about spontaneously.5

Chapter 9 Leadership in organisations
313
 Radcliﬀ e maintains that leadership is not mysterious, it is completely natural. Leadership is 
plain and simple. The only qualifi cation to be a leader is the desire to grow. It absolutely does 
not matter where you are in an organisation. 
  This ‘leadership stuff ’ really needn’t be complicated. I believe that leading is a natural, human 
activity that is part of all of us. You don’t need a certain IQ or job title to be a leader. 
 There are only three aspects to leading: Future, Engage, Deliver. 
 ●  First, leading always starts in the Future. 
 ●  Second, if you want the help of others to create that Future, you need to Engage them. 
 ●  Third, in Deliver, you make things happen. 6 
 Diff erent perspectives 
 Despite continuing debate on diff erences between management and leadership, there is a close 
relationship and it is not easy to separate them as distinct activities. There appears to be an 
increasing tendency to emphasise the interrelationship between management and leadership 
and to see them more as synonymous. Many methods of management training can also be 
used as a means of measuring leadership style. For example, the Leadership Grid® (discussed 
in  Chapter  10 ) was until recently known as the Managerial Grid ® . 
 Mintzberg does not accept a distinction between the manager or the leader and poses the 
questions: ‘How would you like to be managed by someone who doesn’t lead; or why would 
you want to be led by someone who doesn’t manage?’ 
 Frankly, I don’t understand what this distinction means in the everyday life of organizations. 
Sure, we can separate leading and managing conceptually. But can we separate them in 
practice? Or, more to the point, should we even try? 7 
 Moorcroft  suggests two perspectives on the debate between leadership and management: 
  The debate between Leadership and Management is well rehearsed, and usually produces 
shades of two perspectives, presented here as extremes: A hierarchical relationship with Lead-
ership at the top; Leadership and Management equal in status, but at opposite ends of a 
continuum. Frankly, there is little evidence to support one view over the other. But there is 
overwhelming evidence that people like the idea of being a ‘leader’. Indeed this may be the 
reason why the debate still rages, as it fulfi ls a need for diff erentiation. 8  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 in universities, many lecturers inspire students and are viewed usually as leaders not managers. in sport, we hear 
frequent talk about great leaders who are not managers of the team. there appears to be a clear and accepted dis-
tinction between leadership and management. 
 Why do YOU think this distinction does not appear to apply in the same way within business organisations? How do 
YOU distinguish between leadership and management? 
 Approaches to leadership 
 There are many ways of looking at  leadership and interpretations of its meaning. Leadership 
might be interpreted in simple terms, such as ‘getting others to follow’ or ‘getting people to do 
things willingly’, or interpreted more specifi cally, for example as ‘the use of authority in deci-
sion-making’. It may be exercised as an attribute of position or because of personal knowledge 
or wisdom. Leadership might be based on a function of personality or it can be seen as a 

314
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
behavioural category. It may also be viewed in terms of the role of the leaders and their ability 
to achieve effective performance from others. Leadership can also be discussed in terms of a 
form of persuasion or power relationship. It is difficult, therefore, to generalise about leader-
ship, but essentially it is a relationship through which one person influences the behaviour or 
actions of other people. This means that the process of leadership cannot be separated from 
the activities of groups and effective team building.
Due to its complex and variable nature, there are many alternative ways of analysing leader-
ship. It is helpful, therefore, to have some framework in which to consider different approaches 
to study of the subject.
One way is to examine managerial leadership in terms of:
● a qualities or traits approach;
● a functional or group approach, including action-centred leadership;
● styles of leadership;
● contingency theories;
● transitional or transformational leadership;
● inspirational or visionary leadership; and
● servant leadership. (See Figure 9.1.)
Qualities or traits approach
This approach assumes that leaders are born and not made. Leadership consists of certain 
inherited characteristics, or personality traits, which distinguish leaders from their followers. 
The qualities (traits) approach focuses attention on the man or woman in the job and not on 
the job itself. It suggests that attention is given to the selection of leaders rather than to train-
ing for leadership.
Drucker (writing originally in 1955) makes the point that:
Leadership is of utmost importance. Indeed there is no substitute for it. But leadership cannot 
be created or promoted. It cannot be taught or learned.9
However, attempts at identifying common personality, or physical and mental, characteristics 
of different ‘good’ or ‘successful’ leaders have met with little success.10 Investigations have 
identified lists of traits that tend to be overlapping, contradictory or with little correlation for 
most features. It is noticeable that ‘individuality’ or ‘originality’ usually features in the list. 
This suggests there is little in common between specific personality traits of different leaders. 
It is perhaps possible therefore to identify general characteristics of leadership ability, such as 
self-confidence, initiative, intelligence and belief in one’s actions, but research into this area 
has revealed little more than this.
Limitations of the traits approach
There are three further limitations with this approach:
● There is bound to be some subjective judgement in determining who is regarded as a ‘good’ 
or ‘successful’ leader. (This can make for an interesting class discussion.)
● The lists of possible traits tend to be very long and there is not always agreement on the 
most important.
● It ignores the situational factors.
Even if it were possible to identify an agreed list of more specific qualities, this would provide 
little explanation of the nature of leadership or the development and training of future lead-
ers. The qualities or traits approach gives rise to the questions of whether leaders are born or 
made and whether leadership is an art or a science. The important point, however, is that these

Belief that there is no single style of leadership appropriate to all situations. 
TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP 
A process of engendering motivation and commitment, creating a vision
for transforming the performance of the organisation, and appealing to the
higher ideals and values of followers. 
INSPIRATIONAL LEADERSHIP 
Based on the personal qualities or charisma of the leader and
the manner in which the leadership influence is exercised. 
SERVANT LEADERSHIP
More a philosophy based on an ethical responsibility of leaders. A spiritual
understanding of people; and empowering people through honesty,

shared and distributed leadership, and responsible leadership.
QUALITIES OR TRAITS APPROACH

316
part 3 groUps, Leadership and ManageMent
are not mutually exclusive alternatives. Even if there are certain inborn qualities that make 
for a good leader, these natural talents need encouragement and development. Even if leader-
ship is something of an art, it still requires the application of special skills and techniques. 
Although there is still limited interest in the qualities or traits approach, attention has been 
directed more to other approaches to leadership. 
 Functional (or group) approach 
 This approach to leadership focuses attention not on the personality of the leader, nor on the 
man or woman in the job, per se, but on the contents or  functions of leadership. Leadership 
is always present in any group engaged in a task. The functional approach views leadership 
in terms of how the leader’s behaviour aff ects, and is aff ected by, the group of followers. This 
approach concentrates on the nature of the group, the followers or subordinates. 
 The functional approach believes the skills of leadership can be learned, developed and per-
fected. In contrast to the view of Drucker (referred to above),  Kotter makes the point that suc-
cessful companies do not wait for leaders to come along: ‘They actively seek out people with 
leadership potential and expose them to career experiences designed to develop that poten-
tial. Indeed, with careful selection, nurturing and encouragement, dozens of people can play 
important leadership roles in a business organisation.’ 11 A similar point is made by  Whitehead: 
 There has been a dramatic change in how management thinkers regard leadership today. 
Leaders are not born, they say, but made. And the good news is everyone can do it. You don’t 
have to be promoted to a management position. You can be a leader whatever job you do. 
You don’t have to be the boss to be a leader. 12  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Leadership is all about determination, personality and innate ability at the right time for a particular competitive 
situation. Many effective business leaders have no formal academic qualifications and each has their own individual 
leadership style. 
 Does this suggest to YOU that successful leaders are more likely born rather than trained? Do YOU believe YOU would 
make a successful leader? 
 Action-centred leadership 
 A general theory on the functional approach is associated with the work of  John Adair and 
his ideas on  action-centred leadership , which focuses on what leaders actually  do. 13 The eff ec-
tiveness of the leader is dependent upon meeting three areas of need: the need to achieve the 
common  task; the need for  team maintenance;  and the  individual needs of group members – 
symbolised by three overlapping circles ( see  Figure  9.2 ). 
 ●  Task needs involve achieving objectives and defi ning group tasks, organising the work, 
duties and responsibilities and controlling quality and performance. 
 ●  Team maintenance needs involve maintaining morale and team spirit, maintaining stand-
ards and discipline, and training and communication within the group. 
 ●  Individual needs involve meeting needs of individual members and attending to personal 
problems, giving praise and status, and reconciling confl icts between group needs and 
needs of the individual. 
 Action by the leader in any one area of need will aff ect one or both of the other areas. The 
ideal position is where complete integration of the three areas of need is achieved. 

Chapter 9  Leadership in organisations
317
Styles of leadership
In the work situation it has become increasingly clear that managers can no longer rely solely 
on the use of their position in the hierarchical structure. To get the best results from subor-
dinates the manager must also have regard for the need to encourage high morale, a spirit 
of involvement and co-operation, and a willingness to work. This gives rise to consideration 
of the style of leadership and provides another heading under which to analyse leadership 
behaviour.
Leadership style is the way in which the functions of leadership are carried out, the way 
in which the manager typically behaves towards members of the group. There are many 
possible ways of describing leadership style, such as abdicatorial, benevolent, bureau-
cratic, charismatic, consultative, dictatorial, inspirational, participative, servant or unitary. 
With so many potential descriptions of leadership styles it is useful to have a broad frame-
work in which to focus attention and study. The style of managerial leadership towards

There are times when leadership comes out of all of us. A few years ago, some of my team and I were caught up in 
the terrorist attack on the Taj Hotel in Mumbai. We were stuck inside, debris was falling and people were screaming. 
But a young member of staff rose to the situation and took care of us. This 22 year-old woman guided us through the 
hotel and led us to safety. Nothing in her training had ever taught her how to respond in a situation like that, but she 
was calm, composed and unflappable. The way she exerted her authority was amazing. She showed me a lesson in 
leadership – you can lead in a moment, with your heart.

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
subordinate staff and the focus of power can therefore be considered within a simplified 
three-fold heading:
● Authoritarian (autocratic) style, where the focus of power is with the manager and interac-
tions within the group move towards the manager. The manager alone exercises decision-
making and authority for determining policy, procedures for achieving goals, work tasks 
and relationships and control of rewards or punishments.
● Democratic style, where the focus of power is more with the group as a whole and there is 
greater interaction within the group. The leadership functions are shared with members of 
the group and the manager is more part of a team. Group members have a greater say in 
decision-making, determination of policy and implementation of systems and procedures.
● Laissez-faire (genuine) style, where the manager observes members of the group are work-
ing well on their own. The manager consciously makes a decision to pass the focus of 
power to members, allow them freedom of action ‘to do as they think best’, not to interfere 
but to be readily available if help is needed. There is often confusion over this style of lead-
ership. The word ‘genuine’ is emphasised because this is to be contrasted with the manager 
who could not care, who deliberately keeps away from the trouble spots and does not want 
to get involved. Members are then left to face decisions that rightly belong with the man-
ager. This is more a non-style of leadership, or it could perhaps be labelled as abdication.
Continuum of leadership behaviour
One of the best-known works on leadership style is that by Tannenbaum and Schmidt (see 
Figure 9.3).14 Originally written in 1958 and updated in 1973, their work suggests a continuum 
of possible leadership behaviour available to a manager. The continuum presents a range of 
action related to the degree of authority used by the manager and to the area of freedom avail-
able to non-managers in arriving at decisions.
Four main styles of leadership
Moving along the continuum, the manager may be characterised according to the degree of 
control that is maintained. Neither extreme of the continuum is absolute as there is always 
some limitation on authority and on freedom. This approach can be seen as identifying four 
main styles of leadership by the manager: tells, sells, consults, joins.
● Tells – The manager identifies a problem, makes a decision and announces this to subordi-
nates, expecting them to implement it without an opportunity for participation.
● Sells – The manager still makes a decision but recognises the possibility of some resistance 
from those faced with the decision and attempts to persuade subordinates to accept it.
● Consults – The manager identifies the problem but does not make a decision until the prob-
lem is presented to the group, and the manager has listened to the advice and solutions sug-
gested by subordinates.
● Joins – The manager defines the problem and the limits within which the decision must 
be made and then passes to the group, with the manager as a member, the right to make 
decisions.
Three main forces
Tannenbaum and Schmidt suggest that there are three factors, or forces, of particular impor-
tance in deciding what types of leadership are practicable and desirable. These are: forces in 
the manager, forces in the subordinate and forces in the situation.

Chapter 9  Leadership in organisations
319
Forces in the manager. The manager’s behaviour will be influenced by his or her personal-
ity, background, knowledge and experiences. These internal forces will include:
● value-systems;
● confidence in subordinates;
● leadership inclinations;
● feelings of security in an uncertain situation.
Forces in the subordinate. Subordinates are influenced by many personality variables and their 
individual set of expectations about their relationship with the manager. Characteristics of 
the subordinate are:
● strength of the need for independence;
● readiness to assume responsibility for decision-making;
● degree of tolerance for ambiguity;
● interest in the problem and feelings as to its importance;
● understanding and identification with the goals of the organisation;
● necessary knowledge and experience to deal with the problem;
● extent of learning to expect to share in decision-making.
The greater the positive response to these characteristics, the greater freedom of action can be 
allowed by the manager.

part 3 groUps, Leadership and ManageMent
 Forces in the situation. The manager’s behaviour will be infl uenced by the general situation 
and environmental pressures. Characteristics in the situation include: 
 ●  type of organisation; 
 ●  group eff ectiveness; 
 ●  nature of the problem; 
 ●  pressure of time. 
 Tannenbaum and Schmidt conclude that successful leaders are keenly aware of those forces 
that are most relevant to their behaviour at a particular time. They are able to behave appro-
priately in terms of their understanding of themselves, the individuals and the group, the 
organisation and environmental infl uences. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the tannenbaum and schmidt continuum is the single most relevant study of leadership. successful managers need 
to be consistent in both personality and behaviour, yet adaptable to forces that continually influence their leader-
ship style and decision-making. 
 To what extent can YOU argue against this assertion? What do YOU think is the single most important study of 
leadership? 
  Contingency theories of leadership 
 The continuum of leadership behaviour draws attention to forces in the situation as one of the 
main forces infl uencing the nature of managerial behaviour. The  contingency or situational 
approach emphasises the situation as the dominant feature in considering the characteristics of 
eff ective leadership. There are, however, limitations to this approach. There are people who pos-
sess the appropriate knowledge and skills and appear to be the most suitable leaders in a given 
situation, but who do not emerge as eff ective leaders. Also, in the work organisation, it is not 
usually practicable to allow the situation continually to determine who should act as the leader. 
 Despite limitations of the contingency approach, situational factors are important in 
considering the characteristics of leadership. Contingency models focus on the interactions 
between the variables involved in a leadership situation and patterns of leadership behaviour. 
Major contingency models of leadership include: 
 ●  Favourability of leadership situation – Fiedler 
 ●  Quality and acceptance of leader’s decision – Vroom and Yetton 
 ●  Path–goal theory – House, and House and Dessler 
 ●  Readiness level of followers – Hersey and Blanchard. 
 Fiedler’s contingency model 
 One of the fi rst leader–situation models was developed by  Fiedler in his contingency theory of 
leadership eff ectiveness. 15 In order to measure the attitudes of the leader, Fiedler developed a ‘least 
preferred co-worker’ (LPC) scale. This measures the rating given by leaders about the person with 
whom they could work least well. The questionnaire contains up to twenty items. Examples of 
items in the LPC scale are pleasant/unpleasant, friendly/unfriendly, helpful/frustrating, distant/
close, co-operative/unco-operative, boring/interesting, self-assured/hesitant, open/guarded. 
 Each item is given a single ranking of between 1 and 8 points, with 8 points indicating the 
most favourable rating. For example:

The LPC score is the sum of the numerical ratings on all the items for the ‘least preferred co-
worker’. The original interpretation of the LPC scale was that the leader with a high LPC score 
derived most satisfaction from interpersonal relationships. The leader with a low LPC score derived 
most satisfaction from performance of the task and achieving objectives. However, the interpreta-
tion of LPC has changed a number of times and there is still uncertainty about its actual meaning.
Favourability of the leadership situation
Fiedler suggests that leadership behaviour is dependent upon the favourability of the leader-
ship situation. There are three major variables that determine the favourability of the situation 
and that affect the leader’s role and influence:
● Leader–member relations – degree to which the leader is trusted and liked by group mem-
bers, and their willingness to follow the leader’s guidance.
● The task structure – degree to which the task is clearly defined for the group and the extent 
to which it can be carried out by detailed instructions or standard procedures.
● Position power – power of the leader by virtue of position in the organisation, and the 
degree to which the leader can exercise authority to influence (for example) rewards and 
punishments, or promotions and demotions.
From these three variables, Fiedler constructed eight combinations of group–task situations 
through which to relate leadership style (see Figure 9.4).

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
When the situation is very favourable (good leader–member relations, structured task, strong 
position power) or very unfavourable (poor leader–member relations, unstructured task, weak 
position power), then a task-oriented leader (low LPC score) with a directive, controlling style 
will be more effective.
When the situation is moderately favourable and the variables are mixed, then the leader 
with an interpersonal relationship orientation (high LPC score) and a participative approach 
will be more effective.
Fiedler argues that leadership effectiveness may be improved by changing the leadership 
situation. Position power, task structure and leader–member relations can be changed to make 
the situation more compatible with the characteristics of the leader.
Fiedler’s work has been subject to much debate and criticism but it does provide a further 
dimension to the study of leadership.16 It brings into consideration the organisational vari-
ables that affect leadership effectiveness and suggests that in given situations a task-oriented, 
or structured, style of leadership is most appropriate. The ‘best’ styles of leadership will be 
dependent upon the variable factors in the leadership situation.
Vroom and Yetton contingency model
Vroom and Yetton base their analysis on two main aspects of a leader’s decision: its quality 
and its acceptance.17
● Decision quality, or rationality, is the effect that the decision has on group performance.
● Decision acceptance refers to the motivation and commitment of group members in imple-
menting the decision.
A third consideration is:
● the amount of time required to make the decision.
The Vroom and Yetton model suggests five main management decision styles:
● Autocratic
● Leader solves the problem or makes the decision alone using information available at the 
time.
● Leader obtains information from subordinates but then decides on solution alone.
● Consultative
● The problem is shared with relevant subordinates, individually. The leader then makes 
the decision that may or may not reflect the influence of subordinates.
● The problem is shared with subordinates as a group. The leader then makes the decision 
that may or may not reflect the influence of subordinates.
● Group
● The problem is shared with subordinates as a group. The leader acts as chairperson 
rather than an advocate. Together the leader and subordinates generate and evaluate 
alternatives and attempt to reach group consensus on a solution.
Seven decision rules
Vroom and Yetton suggest seven decision rules to help the manager discover the most appro-
priate leadership style in a given situation. The first three rules protect the quality of decisions.
	1.	 Is there a quality requirement such that one solution is likely to be more rational than 
another?
	2.	 Is there sufficient information to make a high-quality decision?
	3.	 Is the problem structured?

Chapter 9  Leadership in organisations
323
The last four rules protect the acceptance of decisions.
	1.	 Is acceptance of the decision by subordinates critical to effective implementation?
	2.	 If you were to make the decision yourself, is it reasonably certain that it would be accepted 
by subordinates?
	3.	 Do subordinates share the organisational goals to be obtained in solving the problem?
	4.	 Is conflict among subordinates likely in preferred solutions?
These rules indicate decision styles that the manager should avoid in a given situation and 
indicate the use of others. Decision-tree charts can be produced to help in the application of 
the rules and to relate the situation to the appropriate leadership style.
Path–goal theory
A third contingency model of leadership is the path–goal theory, the main work on which has 
been undertaken by House18 and by House and Dessler.19 The model is based on the belief that 
the individual’s motivation is dependent upon expectations that increased effort to achieve 
an improved level of performance will be successful, and expectations that improved perfor-
mance will be instrumental in obtaining positive rewards and avoiding negative outcomes. 
This is the ‘expectancy’ theory of motivation (discussed in Chapter 7).
Path–goal theory of leadership suggests that the performance of subordinates is affected 
by the extent to which the manager satisfies their expectations. Subordinates see leadership 
behaviour as a motivating influence to the extent that it means:
● satisfaction of their needs is dependent upon effective performance; and
● the necessary direction, guidance, training and support, which would otherwise be lacking, 
are provided.
Main types of leadership behaviour
House identifies four main types of leadership behaviour:
● Directive leadership – letting subordinates know exactly what is expected of them and giv-
ing specific directions. Subordinates are expected to follow rules and regulations. This type 
of behaviour is similar to ‘initiating structure’ in the Ohio State Leadership Studies.
● Supportive leadership – having a friendly and approachable manner and displaying concern 
for the needs and welfare of subordinates. This type of behaviour is similar to ‘considera-
tion’ in the Ohio State Leadership Studies.
● Participative leadership – consulting with subordinates and the evaluation of their opinions 
and suggestions before the manager makes the decision.
● Achievement-oriented leadership – setting challenging goals for subordinates, seeking 
improvement in their performance and showing confidence in subordinates’ ability to per-
form well.
Path–goal theory suggests that the different types of behaviour can be practised by the same 
person at different times in varying situations. By using one of the four styles of leadership 
behaviour the manager attempts to influence subordinates’ perceptions and motivation, and 
smooth the path to their goals (see Figure 9.5).
Two main situational factors
Leadership behaviour is determined by two main situational factors: personal characteristics 
of subordinates and nature of the task.

324
part 3 groUps, Leadership and ManageMent
 ●  Personal characteristics of subordinates determine how they will react to the manager’s 
behaviour and the extent to which they see such behaviour as an immediate or potential 
source of need satisfaction. 
 ●  Nature of the task relates to the extent that it is routine and structured or non-routine and 
unstructured. 
 Eff ective leadership behaviour is based, therefore, on both the willingness of the manager 
to help subordinates and the needs of subordinates for help. Leadership behaviour will be 
motivational to the extent that it provides necessary direction, guidance and support, helps 
clarify path–goal relationships and removes any obstacles that hinder attainment of goals. 
For example, when a task is highly structured, the goals readily apparent and subordinates are 
confi dent, attempts to further explain the job or to give directions are likely to be viewed as 
unacceptable behaviour. However, when a task is highly unstructured, the nature of the goals 
is not clear and subordinates lack experience, a more directive style of leadership behaviour 
is likely to be welcomed by subordinates. 
  Figure 9.5  representation of the path–goal theory of leadership 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Common sense suggests that situational factors are clearly a major determinant of the most appropriate leadership 
style. But, realistically, contingency models appeal only to teachers rather than practitioners of management. 
 What do YOU think? Can YOU relate any practical example of the apparent application of a contingency model of 
leadership? 
 Readiness of the followers or group 
 A major variable in the style of leadership adopted by the manager is the nature of subordi-
nate staff . This view is developed by  Hersey and Blanchard , who present a form of situational 
leadership based on the ‘readiness’ level of the people the leader is attempting to infl uence. 
Readiness is the extent to which followers have the ability and willingness to accomplish a 
specifi c task. It is not a personal characteristic of the individual but how ready the individual 
is to perform a particular task. 20 
 Readiness (R) is divided into a continuum of four levels: R1 (low), R2 and R3 (moderate) 
and R4 (high): 

Chapter 9  Leadership in organisations
325
● R1 – low follower readiness – refers to followers who are both unable and unwilling and 
who lack commitment and motivation, or who are unable and insecure.
● R2 – low to moderate follower readiness – refers to followers who are unable but willing 
and who lack ability but are motivated to make an effort, or who are unable but confident.
● R3 – moderate to high follower readiness – refers to followers who are able but unwilling, 
and who have the ability to perform but are unwilling to apply their ability, or who are able 
but insecure.
● R4 – high follower readiness – refers to followers who are both able and willing and who 
have the ability and commitment to perform, or who are able and confident.
Task behaviour and relationship behaviour
For each of the four levels of maturity, the appropriate style of leadership is a combination of 
task behaviour and relationship behaviour:
● Task behaviour is the extent to which the leader provides directions for the actions of fol-
lowers, sets goals for them and defines their roles and how to undertake them.
● Relationship behaviour is the extent to which the leader engages in two-way communica-
tion with followers, listens to them and provides support and encouragement.
From the combination of task behaviour and relationship behaviour four leadership styles (S) 
are derived: telling (S1), selling (S2), participating (S3) and delegating (S4). The appropriate 
leadership style corresponds with the readiness of the followers (see Figure 9.6).
● S1 – telling – emphasises high amounts of guidance (task behaviour) but limited supportive 
(relationship) behaviour. This style is most appropriate for low follower readiness (R1).
● S2 – selling – emphasises high amounts of both directive (task) and relationship behaviours. 
This style is most appropriate for low to moderate follower readiness (R2).
● S3 – participating – emphasises a high amount of two-way communication and supportive 
(relationship) behaviour but low amounts of guidance (task behaviour). This style is most 
appropriate for moderate to high follower readiness (R3).
● S4 – delegating – emphasises little direction or support with low levels of both task and 
relationship behaviours. This style is most appropriate for high follower readiness (R4).
Development of subordinates
Hersey and Blanchard suggest the key to using situational leadership is that any leader 
behaviour may be more or less effective according to the readiness of the person the leader 
is attempting to influence. The model draws attention to the importance of developing the 
S1 – telling – emphasises high amounts of guidance (task behaviour) but limited supportive 
(relationship) behaviour. This style is most appropriate for low follower readiness (R1).
Leadership behaviour based on detailed instructions and close supervision
S2 – Selling – emphasises high amounts of both directive (task) and relationalship behaviours. 
This style is most appropriate for low to moderate follower readiness (R2).
Leadership behaviour based on explanation and discussion of decision
S3 – participating – emphasises high amounts of two-way communication and supportive 
(relationship) behaviour but low amounts of guidance (task behaviour). This style is most appro-
priate for moderate to high follower readiness (R3).
Leadership behaviour based on sharing ideas and facilitating decision-making
S4 – delegating – emphasises little direction or support with low levels of both task and relation-
ship behaviour. This style is most appropriate for high follower readiness (R4).
Leadership behaviour based on delegation of responsibility for decisions

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
ability, confidence and commitment of subordinates. The manager should help subordinates 
to develop in readiness to the extent that they are able and willing to go. This development 
should take place by adjusting leadership behaviour through the four styles of telling, selling, 
participating and delegating.
Transformational leadership
Increasing business competitiveness and need for the most effective use of human resources 
have resulted in writers on management focusing attention on how leaders revitalise or 
transform organisations. Based on the work of writers such as Burns, this has given rise to a 
distinction between two fundamental forms of leadership: transactional leadership and trans-
formational (or creative) leadership.21
● Transactional leadership is based on legitimate authority within the bureaucratic struc-
ture of the organisation. The emphasis is on the clarification of goals and objectives, work 
task and outcomes, and organisational rewards and punishments. Transactional leadership 
appeals to the self-interest of followers. It is based on a relationship of mutual dependence 
and an exchange process of ‘I will give you this, if you do that.’
● Transformational (or creative) leadership, by contrast, is a process of engendering higher lev-
els of motivation and commitment among followers. The emphasis is on generating a vision 
for the organisation and the leader’s ability to appeal to higher ideals and values of follow-
ers, and creating a feeling of justice, loyalty and trust. In the organisational sense, transfor-
mational leadership is about transforming the performance or fortunes of a business.
Components of transformational leadership
Applying the ideas of Burns to organisational management, Bass proposed a theory of trans-
formational leadership that argues that the leader transforms and motivates followers by:
	1.	 Generating greater awareness of the importance of the purpose of the organisation and 
task outcomes.
	2.	 Inducing them to transcend their own self-interests for the sake of the organisation or team.
	3.	 Activating their higher-level needs.22
Transformational leadership comprises four basic components:
● idealised influence – the charisma of the leader, and the respect and admiration of the 
followers;
● inspirational motivation – the behaviour of the leader, which provides meaning and chal-
lenge to the work of the followers;
● intellectual stimulation – leaders who solicit new and novel approaches for the performance 
of work and creative problem solutions from followers; and
● individualised consideration – leaders who listen and give special concern to the growth 
and developmental needs of the followers.23
Set of guidelines
Yukl provides a set of guidelines for transformational leadership:
● Articulate a clear and appealing vision of what the organisation could accomplish or 
become to help people understand the purpose, objectives and priorities of the organisa-
tion, and to help guide the actions and decisions of members.
● Explain how the vision can be attained and establish a clear link between the vision and a 
credible conventional yet straightforward strategy for attaining it.
● Act confident and optimistic about likely success, demonstrate self-confidence and convic-
tion and emphasise positive aspects of the vision rather than the obstacles and dangers.

Chapter 9 Leadership in organisations
327
 ●  Express confi dence in followers and their ability to carry out the strategy for accomplishing 
the vision, especially when the task is diffi  cult or dangerous, or when members lack confi -
dence in themselves. 
 ●  Use dramatic, symbolic actions to emphasise key values and demonstrate leadership behav-
iour through dramatic, highly visible actions including risking personal loss, self-sacrifi ce 
or acting unconventionally. 
 ●  Lead by example  by recognising actions speak louder than words, through exemplary 
behaviour in day-to-day interactions with subordinates and by demonstrating consistency 
in daily behaviour. 24  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 transactional and transformational leadership should not be seen as alternatives. any effective leader will clearly use 
a balance of both legitimate authority and attention to higher ideals and values of followers. 
 To what extent do YOU agree? How difficult do YOU think it is to apply this balance in practice? What would be the 
most likely problem areas? 
 Inspirational or visionary leadership 
 Many writers see transformational leadership as the same thing as charismatic, visionary 
or inspirational leadership.  Kreitner et al. refer to charismatic leadership as transforming 
employees to pursue organisational goals over self-interests: 
  Charismatic leaders transform followers by creating changes in their goals, values, needs, 
beliefs, and aspirations. They accomplish this transformation by appealing to followers’ self-
concepts – namely, their values and personal identity. 25 
 Successful transformational leaders are usually identifi ed in terms of providing a strong vision 
and sense of mission, arousing strong emotions in followers and a sense of identifi cation with 
the leader. Leadership today is increasingly associated with the concept of creating a vision 
with which others can identify, getting along with other people and the concept of inspiration. 
This might be considered as part of transformational leadership or arguably it has given rise 
to a new approach to leadership – that of  inspirational or visionary leadership. Inspirational 
leadership is not concerned so much with the theory of leadership but more with the skills of 
motivating and inspiring people. 
 In her discussion of the creation of the democratic enterprise (organisations that can fl our-
ish economically and can also be places of excitement and stimulation, fulfi lment and tran-
quillity),  Gratton maintains that it is the creation of a shared purpose and the role of the 
leadership team that are most vital. The role of the leader as visionary is fundamental to cre-
ating the broad philosophical context of democracy and as the architect of shared purpose. 26 
 Goﬀ ee and Jones point out that the need for visionary leadership is becoming increasingly 
important. Traditional business hierarchies gave managers and workers a sense of their own 
position and what was expected of them. Now, as these hierarchies break down, it is leaders 
themselves who must fi ll the void, helping subordinates to understand their place and purpose. 
Personal leadership is beginning to replace organisation structure. 27 
 Personal qualities or charisma 
 Leadership may be based on the personal qualities, or charisma, of the leader and the man-
ner in which infl uence is exercised. The concept of charismatic or inspirational leadership is 
not new and has been applied in the organisational context by writers such as Max Weber 

328
part 3 groUps, Leadership and ManageMent
(1864–1920). 28 The importance of charisma for eff ective leadership today is emphasised by 
 Conger, who also believes that many of the traits that make a successful leader can be taught, 
including charisma. 
 Now the big question is whether you are born with charisma or whether you can develop it. 
I believe you can develop elements of it. For example, you can take courses to improve your 
speaking skills. You can learn to stage events that send powerful messages. You can learn 
to think more critically about the status quo and its shortcomings. You can do more on a 
daily basis to motivate your team. What you simply cannot learn is how to be passionate 
about what you do. You have to discover that for yourself, and passion is a big part of what 
drives a charismatic leader. It is also what motivates and inspires those who work for the 
charismatic leader. 29  
 However, the extent to which charismatic or inspirational leadership helps bring about 
improvement in organisational performance is open to debate. Conger also draws attention to 
the danger that the leader’s vision, dynamism and inspirational nature are highly attractive to 
followers, which leads to a natural dependence. Staff  see this extraordinary fi gure as a model 
to be emulated and the leader’s abilities become the yardstick by which they measure their own 
performance. This is a potential source of leadership derailment. Dependence makes the fol-
lowers more susceptible to deception. 30 
 Leadership not about the leader 
 Adair argues that to be a truly inspirational leader one must understand the spirit within. 
All people have the potential for greatness. The inspirational leader connects with the led, 
appreciates the capabilities of others and through trust will unlock the powers in others. Adair 
refers to ‘the inspired moment’ – a recognition and seizure of a brief window of opportunity 
that can act as a powerful catalyst that inspires both the leader and the led. 31 
 Leadership is not about the leader, it is about how he or she builds the confi dence of every-
one else. Leaders are responsible for both the big structures that serve as the cornerstone of 
confi dence, and for the human touches that shape a positive emotional climate to inspire 
and motivate people . . . Leaders deliver confi dence by espousing high standards in their 
messages, exemplifying these standards in the conduct they model and establishing formal 
mechanisms to provide a structure for acting on those standards. 32 
 Kingsmill suggests that the belief that real change and transformation will come from a char-
ismatic visionary may have an immediate appeal to some but all too often this can prove to be 
a shallow myth rather than a reality. 
 Frequently, boards of companies that are in trouble look for a corporate saviour from outside 
rather than choose the internal candidate who may have a better understanding of the prob-
lems and how to solve them. Grand strategies that never come to fruition, demoralised people 
whose voices are not heard and innovations that are stifl ed are all too often the real result of 
this preoccupation with the hero leader. 33  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Charisma and the ability to inspire and move loyal followers in the desired direction are among the most contro-
versial leadership qualities. despite the apparent attraction of charisma by itself, it is unlikely to lead to a noticeable 
improvement in organisational performance. 
 To what extent do YOU believe in the organisational benefits of charismatic leadership? To what extent do YOU pos-
sess, or would you like to possess, charisma? 

Chapter 9  Leadership in organisations
329
Servant leadership
In recent years renewed attention has been given to the idea of servant leadership, originally 
proposed in 1970 by Robert Greenleaf.34, 35
The servant-leader is servant first . . . It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to 
serve, to serve first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. That person is sharply 
different from one who is leader first, perhaps because of the need to assuage power drive or 
to acquire material possessions . . . The difference manifests itself in the care taken by the 
servant-first to make sure that other people’s highest priority needs are being served.36
Rather than the use of position power, servant leadership is more a philosophy based on an 
ethical responsibility of leaders, a spiritual understanding of people and empowering people 
through honesty, respect, nurturing and trust. A servant leader gives attention to the needs 
of people and the promotion of their personal development. The focus of leadership is on a 
supportive and participative style of management. A test of servant leadership is the extent to 
which the followers, that is those served, benefit. It might therefore be particularly appropriate 
in service organisations such as in the hospitality industry.37 Servant leadership can be associ-
ated with the idea of positive psychology with an emphasis on human strengths, how things 
go right and how to enhance people’s satisfaction and well-being (discussed in Chapter 1).
Critical characteristics
A set of ten critical characteristics central to servant leadership has been identified by Spears:
● Good communication skills and the motivation to listen actively
● Understanding and empathy with others
● Ability to heal oneself and others
● Self-awareness and to view situations from a holistic position
● Rely on persuasion as opposed to the use of power or status
● Able to conceptualise and think beyond day-to-day realities and focus on long-term goals
● Foreseeing likely outcomes, learning from the past and identifying consequences of future 
decisions
● Stewardship of their organisations for the greater good of society
● Commitment to the personal, professional and spiritual growth of people
● Building a strong organisational community.38
According to Yukl, the values emphasised in servant leadership are primarily about helping 
people and fostering a relationship of trust and cooperation. Yukl lists seven key values and 
examples of how these might be expressed in a leader’s behaviour:
● Integrity – open and honest communications, keeps promises and commitments, accepts 
responsibility for mistakes.
● Altruism – helps others and puts their need before your own, willing to takes risks and 
make sacrifices to benefit others.
● Humility – treats others with respect, avoids status symbols and privileges, modest about 
achievements, emphasises contributions of others.
● Empathy and healing – helps others cope with emotional distress, acts as mediator, encour-
ages reconciliation.
● Personal growth – encourages development of individual confidence and ability, provides 
learning opportunities and mentoring and coaching.
● Fairness and justice – encourages and supports fair treatment, speaks out against unfair 
and unjust practices or policies.
● Empowerment– consults with others about decisions that affect them, provides autonomy 
and discretion, encourages expression of dissenting views.39

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
The focus of servant leadership
According to Wong, the focus of leadership needs to shift from process and outcome to people 
and the future. Servant leadership represents a radical approach – it is humanistic and spir-
itual rather than rational and mechanistic. Command and control leadership no longer works 
because leaders must earn people’s respect and trust. New types of leaders are needed to cre-
ate new futures, and the challenge for management and leadership education is to:
● develop workers and unleash their creative potential;
● create a positive workplace that will attract and retain knowledge workers; and
● reinforce innovations and risk-taking to adapt to an uncertain future.
However, Wong acknowledges common criticism of servant leadership including that it is too 
restrictive, too unrealistic and impractical and would not work in situations such as military 
operations or prison systems. It is too idealistic and naive, too closely related to Christian spir-
ituality and too foreign to a preferred alternative leadership style.40
A summary of leadership and management is set out in the concept map in Figure 9.7.
Power and leadership influence
Leadership influence is a social process and may be seen in terms of the type of power that 
the leader can exercise over the behaviour and actions of others. An early view of social power 
upon which the influence of the leader is based has been presented by French and Raven, who 
identify five main sources: reward power, coercive power, legitimate power, referent power and 
expert power.41 We shall consider these in terms of the manager (as a leader) and subordinate 
relationship. It is important to note that these sources of power are based on the subordinates’ 
perception of the influence of the leader, whether it is real or not.
● Reward power is based on the subordinate’s perception that the leader has the ability and 
resources to obtain rewards for those who comply with directives – for example, pay, pro-
motion, praise, recognition, increased responsibilities, allocation and arrangement of work 
and granting of privileges.
● Coercive power is based on fear and the subordinate’s perception that the leader has the 
ability to punish or to bring about undesirable outcomes for those who do not comply 
with directives – for example, withholding pay rises, promotion or privileges, allocation 
of undesirable duties or responsibilities, withdrawal of friendship or support and formal 
reprimands or possibly dismissal. This is in effect the opposite of reward power.
● Legitimate power is based on the subordinate’s perception that the leader has a right to 
exercise influence because of the leader’s role or position in the organisation. Legitimate 
power is based on authority – for example, that of managers and supervisors within the 
hierarchical structure of an organisation. Legitimate power is therefore ‘position’ power 
because it is based on the role of the leader in the organisation, and not on the nature of the 
personal relationship with others.
● Referent power is based on the subordinate’s identification with the leader. The leader 
exercises influence because of perceived attractiveness, personal characteristics, reputation 
or what is called ‘charisma’. For example, a particular manager may not be in a position to 
reward or punish certain subordinates, but may still exercise power over the subordinates 
because the manager commands their respect or esteem.
● Expert power is based on the subordinate’s perception of the leader as someone who is 
competent and who has some special knowledge or expertise in a given area. Expert power 
is based on credibility and clear evidence of knowledge or expertise, including ‘functional’ 
specialists such as the management accountant or systems analyst.
French and Raven point out that the five sources of power are interrelated and the use of one 
type of power (e.g. coercive) may affect the ability to use another type of power (e.g. referent).

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
Furthermore, the same person may exercise different types of power, in particular circum-
stances and at different times.
Yukl suggests that a further relevant source of power is control over information.42
The leadership relationship
Whatever the perceived approach to leadership, an underlying feature of leadership is the man-
ner in which the leader influences the behaviour and actions of other people. Leadership is 
a dynamic form of behaviour and there are a number of variables that affect the leadership 
relationship. For example, Bass reviews leadership influence in terms of persuasion, a power 
relation, an instrument of goal achievement, an emerging effect of interaction and the initia-
tion of structure.43 Four major variables are identified by McGregor as:
● the characteristics of the leader;
● the attitude, needs and other personal characteristics of the followers;
● the nature of the organisation, such as its purpose, its structure and the tasks to be per-
formed; and
● the social, economic and political environment.
McGregor concludes that ‘leadership is not a property of the individual, but a complex rela-
tionship among these variables’.44
According to Kouzes and Posner, ‘credibility is the foundation of leadership’. From exten-
sive research in over thirty countries and response to the question of what people ‘look for 
and admire in a leader, in a person whose direction they would willingly follow’, people have 
consistently replied that they want:
leaders who exemplify four qualities: they want them to be honest, forward-looking, inspiring 
and competent. In our research our respondents strongly agree that they want leaders with 
integrity and trustworthiness, with vision and a sense of direction, with enthusiasm and pas-
sion, and with expertise and a track record for getting things done.45
Fullan refers to the importance of relationship building as a basic component of the change 
process and effective leadership: ‘Leaders must be consummate relationship builders with 
diverse people and groups – especially with people different from themselves. Effective leaders 
constantly foster purposeful interaction and problem solving, and are wary of easy consensus.’46
Roddick makes the point that:
You have to look at leadership through the eyes of the followers and you have to live the 
message. What I have learned is that people become motivated when you guide them to the 
source of their own power and when you make heroes out of employees who personify what 
you want to see in the organisation.47
Power, responsibility and wisdom
Lloyd suggests that the way we think about leadership is a contributory factor to the lead-
ership crisis. Leadership has traditionally been associated with those who have power and 
there is a need to re-examine the core relationship between power and responsibility. Rather 
than gaining and keeping power for ourselves, more emphasis should be given to unifying 
consideration of the two concepts together with greater attention to the subject of wisdom.
The new agenda moves us from that narrow focus to a much broader concept of leader-
ship that is more concerned with how power is used, i.e. in whose interest power is used. 
This explicitly recognises that the use of power is deeply values driven . . . We need to give 
much greater attention to the values agenda by exploring wisdom, then seeing that emphasis 
reflected as wise leadership.48 

Chapter 9 Leadership in organisations
333
 Culture as a contingent factor? 
 The contribution of contingency approaches to understanding leadership suggests that contrasting 
types and styles of leadership may be more or less appropriate in diff erent situations. A consistent 
view expressed within the literature is that a major variable infl uencing choice of leadership style 
may be national culture. We should be wary of stereotyping the behaviour of leaders or subordi-
nates, and many myths appear to have grown around notions of ‘orderly’ German, ‘undisciplined’ 
Italian and even ‘obstructive’ British workers. However, there are reasons to suggest that there may 
indeed be national cultural diff erences that are relevant to an understanding of leadership. 
 Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior 
Eff ectiveness (GLOBE) 
 Project GLOBE was a large-scale research project that sought to identify those leader behav-
iours and attributes that would be accepted and therefore eff ective in all societies and, con-
trastingly, those that would only be accepted and eff ective in some cultural contexts. This 
study was conducted by an international team of researchers led by  Robert House and encom-
passed sixty-two countries across the world, including some that had not always featured in 
cross-cultural study – for example, newly capitalist states in Eastern Europe. The GLOBE 
study commenced in 1991 and led to a series of publications in the early twenty-fi rst century.  49 
 The results, according to the GLOBE researchers, are some signifi cant variations in leader-
ship style, attributes and behaviour. Charismatic and team-orientated leaders were shown to be 
globally endorsed – and hence universally eff ective. Leaders who displayed high levels of trust, 
integrity and vision were supported by subordinates in all societies. It was also found that there 
were so-called universal impediments to success: for example,  self-protective leaders charac-
terised by malevolence and ‘face-saving’ were viewed negatively by subordinates in all cultures. 
 There were some aspects of leadership that varied between societies. In common with Hof-
stede  (see  Chapter  1 ) , the GLOBE study identifi es clusters of societies with important points 
of commonality. To take one example, in a situation that might imply a directive style of 
leadership, subordinates in the ‘Anglo’ cluster of societies (in eff ect, the main English-speaking 
countries) would prefer some degree of informality on the part of the leader and as much of a 
participative style as the situation allowed. 
 The GLOBE study recognises that strategic organisational contingencies such as the sector 
an organisation operates in will aff ect leadership style and behaviour. However, the GLOBE 
researchers concluded that such factors would be moderated by the national cultural context. 
Leader eff ectiveness will be infl uenced by the interaction between leaders and subordinates, 
which is dependent on the nature of power relations within the particular culture, and organi-
sational contingencies applying in all societies. 50 
 Diff erences or shared values? 
 According to  Walker, too much focus in recent decades has been on Western approaches to 
leadership and that a study of alternative methods can help inspire leaders – wherever they 
are. In the Far East, for example, face-to-face contact and relationship building are prized 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Whatever the debate on leadership relationship and ideas such as servant leadership, the harsh reality is that influ-
ence exercised by a leader depends on the amount of power and authority the leader can exert over other people. 
 Can YOU present a strong argument against this assertion? What form of leadership influence best describes YOUR 
relationship with tutors or senior administrative staff? 

334
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
more highly than here. Walker suggests that new thinking sees Asian business culture not as a 
challenge to be overcome but as a source of leadership inspiration.51
However, in response to the question of whether different business cultures affect how we 
view good leadership, Murray refers to the importance of shared company values overriding 
any cultural differences.
A shared set of company values is the glue that binds people, builds trust and enables an 
organisation to function across cultural barriers . . . While expectations on leaders might 
not be the same everywhere, and may have cultural variations, there is no doubt employees 
have a general desire to be respected, valued and involved. This is a trend that transcends 
geographical and cultural barriers. Leaders must respond to this demand, wherever they are.52
Leadership effectiveness
Attention to style of leadership has come about because of a greater understanding of the 
needs and expectations of people at work. It has also been influenced by such factors as: 
broader standards of education and training and advances in scientific and technical knowl-
edge; pressure for a greater social responsibility towards employees, for example through 
schemes of participation in decision-making and work/life balance; legislation, for example in 
the areas of employment protection; and influence of the European Union.
These factors have combined to create resistance against purely autocratic styles of leader-
ship. There is an assumption that subordinates are more likely to work effectively for managers 
who adopt a certain style of leadership than for managers who adopt alternative styles.
Goleman reports that the most effective executives use a collection of distinct leadership styles, 
each in the right measure, at just the right time. Although the authoritative style of leadership 
can be occasionally overbearing, it was found to be most effective and can motivate and inspire 
commitment to the goals of the organisation. The affiliative style has potential to create har-
mony within teams and can be used in conjunction with the authoritative style. The democratic 
approach was seen as positive, and encourages input from staff and helps build consensus through 
participation. The coaching style, although the least frequently used, can help staff identify their 
strengths and encourage long-term development goals. The study concludes that the most effec-
tive leaders rely on more than one leadership style and were able to master a mixture of authorita-
tive, democratic, affiliative and coaching styles. Leaders with the best results use most of the styles 
in a given week – seamlessly and in different measure – depending on the business situation.53
The shadow of leadership
Leadership is clearly a major feature of effective teamwork. Good leaders surround them-
selves with talented and capable members of staff, and their behaviour and actions serve as a 
role model. McCabe suggests that leaders who want to transform their performance and the 
effectiveness of the team should look at how their own shadow could be getting in the way. 
Leaders focus on what they see as important and they are typically quite unconscious of the 
unintended but massive impact they are having on their colleagues, teams and clients. All lead-
ers cast a shadow, and whatever a particular leadership style, the shadow will affect others and 
can compromise people’s engagement at work and business effectiveness. Leaders need to be 
fully aware of the shadow they cast and the impact they have on others.
To be successful, leaders today have to find ways to engage people’s ideas, energy and inspi-
ration and this means they will have to build much stronger relationships – and what will 
prevent such relationships from occurring is their shadow.54
Authority without arrogance
In his discussion on the skills of clear leadership, and sustaining collaboration and partnership 
at work, Bushe draws attention to the importance of authority. Collaborative work systems may 
flatten hierarchies and reduce command and control but do not decrease or eliminate authority. 

Chapter 9  Leadership in organisations
335
Authority and hierarchy are two separate things. In collaborative organisations authority is 
widely spread and more people are authorised to make decisions and take actions. Authority is 
the power to make and enforce decisions. This is one reason why these organisations need people 
using the skills of clear leadership: self-awareness, descriptiveness, curiosity and appreciation.55
The turbulent and uncertain economic situation of recent times has resulted in many commen-
tators drawing attention to the expectations for clear, decisive and authoritative leadership. For 
example, Masson refers to the leadership attribute of self-assurance, being authentic and com-
fortable with whom you are. What leaders need is an acute self-awareness and to avoid arrogance.
That self-assurance needs to come with an honest assessment of oneself. The whole idea of 
perfection in leadership is outdated and unhelpful, and leaders who don’t open themselves 
to feedback, and don’t reflect on their own behavior, come across as arrogant. Part of being 
‘authentic’ is being open to vulnerability and admitting to one’s mistakes.56
Reeves and Knell suggest that being a successful leader is less about who you are or what 
you do than about what you know. This includes four pieces of knowledge: where the organi-
sation is heading; what is going on; who they are; and how to build a strong team. Leaders 
in the most successful organisations are authoritative but their secret is that they use their 
authority without arrogance. Successful leaders:
● build a ‘culture of discipline’ and are about getting things done, controlling costs and mar-
shalling resources;
● keep in touch with how people are feeling – they do not waste time worrying if everyone 
is happy but understand the emotional temperament of the organisation and emotional 
responses from people;
● know where they are strong but also know their weaknesses and display a fierce humility;
● are motivated by what they build, such as great teams and talented people, rather than what 
they get;
● have a clear sense of where the organisation is going, but very often this is the result of col-
lective decision-making in a talent team.57
No one best form of leadership
We have seen that there are many alternative forms and styles of managerial leadership. Within 
an organisation different individuals may fulfil the functions of leadership and there are many 
different styles of leadership. A potential danger with the contingency approach is that the 
manager may appear to lack consistency in leadership style. However, although subordinates 
may reasonably expect some degree of consistency from the manager in approaching the same 
type of problem with the same style, this is not to say that different types of problems should 
be approached in the same manner. Subordinates would ordinarily expect a different style of 
managerial leadership according to the contingencies of the situation.
Variables affecting leadership effectiveness
Clearly, there is no one ‘best’ form of leadership that will result in the maintenance of morale 
among group members and high work performance. Three main aspects to be considered in 
determining the most appropriate style of leadership are the manager, the group and the work 
environment. However, there are many variables that underlie the effectiveness of leadership in 
work organisations. More specifically, these include the following:
● characteristics of the manager – personality, attitudes, abilities, value-system and personal 
credibility;
● type of power of the manager and basis of the leadership relationship;
● characteristics of the followers – diversity, needs and expectations, attitudes, knowledge, 
confidence and experience, and motivation and commitment;
● type and nature of the organisation, organisation culture and structure;
● nature of the tasks to be achieved and time scales;

336
part 3 groUps, Leadership and ManageMent
 ●  technology, systems of communication and methods of work organisation; 
 ●  informal organisation, and the psychological contract; 
 ●  nature and infl uence of the external environment and national culture. 
 In addition there is an argument that physical attributes, such as height, can be associated with 
good leadership  (discussed in  Chapter  6 ). 
 Right style for the right situation 
 An eff ective manager will clearly recognise that diff erent styles of leadership are called for in 
diff erent situations. As an extreme example, emergency situations demand an assertive, direc-
tive style of action. (Recall the actual example of the Mumbai hotel attack given above.) As 
 Rajan also points out: ‘Of course, diff erent leadership styles are needed to cope with diff erent 
situations: for example, the autocratic style makes sense when an organisation is in deep trou-
ble and needs to achieve a rapid turn-around. That style would be counter-productive when 
the organisation is in a growth situation.’ 58 
 And  Stern maintains that although in more carefree times business gurus exalted leaders 
who admitted to frailty, this is not so any more. The task of sustaining growth in a sluggish 
market calls for driven, leather-skinned bosses. Instead of touchy-feely management the qual-
ity of ‘mental toughness’ is needed to help elite performers to prevail. 59 
 Diff erent types of leadership may also be most appropriate at diff erent stages in the devel-
opment of a business organisation. Leadership can also vary between public and private sec-
tors and depend upon the size of the organisation. A primary challenge for organisational 
leaders in promoting innovation is to: 
  Recognise and develop appropriate leadership for the diff erent stages of the innovation pro-
cess. How leaders are selected, supported, evaluated, motivated and developed is likely to dif-
fer depending upon the stage of the innovation process they are responsible for. For instance, 
transformational leadership skills may be more useful in early-stage innovation activity, such 
as R & D and product development, but transactional leadership skills are also essential to the 
smooth functioning of commercialisation. 60  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 there is much commentary on the need for less hierarchical structures and a changed culture of leadership based on 
skills and competencies throughout the organisation as a whole. 
 How realistic do YOU think this is? How do YOU believe leadership potential can best be developed? And what do 
YOU see as the future of leadership? 
  Alternative views of leadership 
 In recent years the changing nature of the work organisation, referred to at the start of this 
chapter, has drawn attention to diff erent, broader approaches to the study of leadership, 
including shared and distributed leadership and responsible leadership. 
 Shared and distributed leadership 
 As with servant leadership, discussed earlier, the original idea of distributed leadership can 
be traced back many years. For example,  Mary Parker Follet, writing in 1941, envisioned 
management responsibility not just concentrated at the top of the hierarchy, but diff used 

CHAPTER 9 LEADERSHIP IN ORGANISATIONS
337
throughout the organisation from the depersonalising of orders and obeying the law of the 
situation. 61 ,  62  
 Rather than a traditional view of a single, all-powerful and visionary appointed leader, the 
underlying concept of  shared and distributed leadership is of multiple leaders throughout the 
organisation. As opposed to hierarchical leadership, distributed leadership gives recognition 
to the sharing of the leadership function, power and decision-making among staﬀ  at all levels 
and positions including the role of the informal organisation  (discussed in  Chapter  3 ).  Day et 
al. suggest that collective leadership from many diﬀ erent members of the organisation is of 
more importance than the actions of any individual leader. 63 
 With the continuing pace of change, developments in ICT and uncertain economic envi-
ronment, leadership functions will evolve and leadership roles change according to the situa-
tion. With increasing emphasis on teamwork, attention has been focused on the signiﬁ cance of 
the leadership function for team performance. Greater awareness of the beneﬁ ts from a more 
diverse workforce has also encouraged distributed leadership.  Hewlett et al. draw attention to 
the wider community leadership roles of ethnic minority staﬀ  who may hold only junior posi-
tions in the organisation. 64 
 Responsible leadership 
 The term  responsible leadership has emerged as an organisation’s approach to governance, 
social responsibilities and business ethics. According to Business In The Community, the chal-
lenge for business leaders is to ensure the wider responsibilities of business are understood 
within their organisation and in society to demonstrate how a responsible approach to busi-
ness will create value. 
 Business leaders must be seen to act and demonstrate their commitment to creating a fairer 
society and a more sustainable future by fostering a culture that will encourage innovation, 
reward the right behaviours and regain trust. In short, leaders must write a new contract with 
society into their own business. 65 
 However, as the  Financial Times points out: 
  Responsible Leadership, as a business school subject area, is less about ethical theory and 
more about ethical practice based on case studies. The practice has a particular focus on an 
individual’s values system and the pragmatic application of an individual’s values in the real-
life challenging dilemmas of business. 66 
 Corporate responsibility and ethics are the subject of  Chapter  14 .

 The Post Oﬃ  ce – Women in Leadership Programme 
➔
 The Post Oﬃ  ce is a commercial organisation with a social purpose. Its network of around 11,800 branches delivers 
over 170 products and services, serves 18 million customers per week and has 7,845 employees. Facing a speciﬁ c 
challenge of declining female representation (March 2013: 61.4 per cent of frontline positions/43.8 per cent of ﬁ rst-
line management/35.5 per cent of senior management/22.2 per cent of senior leadership), and a quarter of roles 
were part-time (90 per cent ﬁ lled by women), it needed to increase females in senior teams. Initiatives included:

 Leadership development 
 Education and training in management needs to emphasise not only interpersonal skills, but 
also a fl exibility of approach, diagnostic ability and realisation that the most eff ective form 
of leadership behaviour is a product of the total leadership situation.  Melville-Ross refers to 
the importance of developing leadership skills in everyone, not just those at the top. 67 Even 
people in the most junior positions can play a leadership role. It is about the dissemination 
of ideas, taking the initiative and encouraging others to see it that way. For this to happen, 
there has to be an open leadership culture that runs right through the organisation. People 
are encouraged to take personal responsibility and are not afraid to speak up with ideas or 
take risks. 
 The leadership jigsaw 
 Cutler has designed a ‘jigsaw’ of best practice. There are six interlinking pieces: vision, 
example, relationships, motivation, empowerment and communications as a guide to the 
measurement and development of leadership skills. Cutler believes that leadership is not 
such a diffi  cult role if condensed to these essential elements and has devised a set of ques-
tions to help aspiring leaders to fi nd out if they have all the necessary pieces of the jigsaw 
( see  Figure  9.8 ). 68  
 transparent Diversity targets – For 2013–14 the business set a target of appointing women into 40 per cent of 
its senior leadership and senior management roles, a 7 per cent increase on the 2012–13 out-turn. 
 Line Manager Support – workshops for seventy senior managers were run to explain the target and what people 
could do to support it. sessions focused on the business case and unconscious bias. 
 each event brings together eighty of the organisation’s high-potential women identifi ed through existing perfor-
mance and potential data. the events take place every three months with the objectives of: 
 1.  profi ling female role models (internal and external). 
 2.  Working on real business problems (a recent event focused on our female sMe customer proposition). 
 3.  networking (our full executive is invited to the events so our aspiring female leaders can meet them informally). 
 regular Follow-Up Communication  – Bi-annual Women in Leadership events where high-potential women 
met role models, networked and worked on real business problems. Launch of a communications campaign called 
‘3 minutes with’ featuring an interview with someone in the post offi  ce with a diverse perspective. Feedback for 
the event has been very positive with an average rating of 9.5 out of 10. the outcome resulted in 45.7 per cent of 
women appointed into senior management roles. the senior leadership team is now 28.3 per cent female. 
 this activity is supporting the business to achieve a greater level of customer excellence and business engage-
ment. the employee survey saw a 2 per cent increase in the level of customer understanding. the senior man-
agement talent programme identifi ed 40 per cent female members, over 4 per cent above the wider female 
representation at that level and a female engagement index of 58 per cent– currently 7 per cent above the organi-
sational norm.

Seven principles for developing leaders
Referring to his action-centred leadership model (discussed earlier in this chapter), Adair iden-
tifies seven key principles of leadership development that can be applied successfully in differ-
ent kinds of organisations in both the public and private sectors.
● Development of a strategy for leadership development for each of the three levels of leader-
ship – operational, strategic and team.
● Selection of those with high potential for becoming effective leaders.
● Training for leadership that implies instruction with a specific end in view. Identify your 
business training needs in the leadership context and assign them priorities.
● Career development through giving a person the right job at the right time. People grow as 
leaders through the actual practice of leading.

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
● Line managers as leadership developers by developing the individual’s potential and shar-
ing their knowledge of leadership.
● Corporate culture that is valued at all levels and should encourage a climate of self-develop-
ment in leadership.
● The chief executive who should be leading from the front and who owns the problem of 
growing leaders.
The seven principles are complementary and are likely to have a synergetic effect if applied 
as a whole. Although a simple framework, Adair maintains the seven principles form the first 
coherent and effective approach for growing leaders.69
We are not born as leaders, but we are born with the potential to become a leader. This 
potential has to be worked on and we have to go through a learning experience to equip us 
to become leaders. Sometimes the potential is realised and sometimes it is not. Opportunities 
play a part in this; the best organisations seem to grow their own leaders. The best, the very 
good and the excellent do give priority to developing leaders.70
Intuitive intelligence in leadership
According to Bacon, a critical factor in leadership development is the intuitive intelligence 
of leaders, especially when it comes to decision-making. We use our instinct and intuition 
in many facets of our personal lives, but Bacon questions if we underutilise one of the most 
powerful leadership tools at work. Much credence is given to emotional intelligence (dis-
cussed in Chapter 4) but perhaps the greatest weapon for business decision-making is intui-
tive intelligence.
Many people feel that intuition has little or no place in business, that decisions should be 
based on empirical evidence rather than on trusting your gut feeling. But there is increasing 
evidence that intuition is more than merely a feeling. Many scientists now believe that it is, in 
fact, the result of our brains piecing together information and experiences to come to differ-
ent, and less obvious conclusions.
Bacon maintains that intuitive intelligence can be trained, and the best leaders have learned 
not only to just trust their instincts but to obey them by listening to one’s own internal voice. 
Situations in which leaders rely most consistently on their intuitive intelligence include:
● in a crisis when rapid response is required;
● high-speed change when situations are changing rapidly without warning;
● in a messy situation when a problem or challenge is poorly constructed;
● in an ambiguous situation when there are contradictory factors to consider.71
Importance of self-awareness
An underlying feature of effective leadership is self-awareness: understanding who you are, 
and what you are thinking and feeling. Benjamin sees a leader simply as someone who takes 
the lead and whom other people are inclined to follow willingly. The sense of who you are is so 
important because leadership is, at heart, about leading people.
Approaching leadership with a clear sense of self will give you the strength to work with oth-
ers respectfully but also the confidence to challenge another’s opinion or authority because 
you know what you stand for, and what your principles and beliefs are.72
Blanchard believes that all good leadership starts with a shared vision. The best and most 
respected leaders share not just their visions for the future of their organisations with their 
people, but also their personal beliefs about how and why they lead as they do. Blanchard sug-
gests clarifying and sharing your leadership point of view means answering seven questions:
	1.	 Who are the people who have influenced you in your life?
	2.	 What is your life purpose?

Chapter 9 Leadership in organisations
341
  3.  What core values will guide your behaviour as you live your life ‘on purpose’? 
  4.  What are your beliefs about leading and motivating people? 
  5.  What can people expect of you? 
  6.  What do you expect from your people? 
  7.  How will you set an example? 73 
 In his discussion on the future of management,  Hamel argues the point that in any constitu-
tional democracy success does not depend upon brilliant leadership. If democracies are more 
resilient than large companies it is not because they are better led. In a democracy, the pace of 
change depends only tangentially on the vision and moral courage of those in power: ‘The real 
challenge, then, isn’t to hire or grow great leaders, but to build companies that can thrive with 
less-than-perfect leaders.’ 74  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 despite vast amounts of writing on the subject, it is extremely difficult to give a precise and agreed meaning of 
leadership. nor is there agreement on one best model or style of leadership, or how leadership potential can best 
be developed. 
 Do YOU find this confusing and a hindrance to your studies? What do YOU believe are the essential and distinctive 
characteristics that make for an effective leader? 
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  there are many ways of looking at leadership but essentially it is a relationship through which 
one person infl uences the behaviour or actions of other people. 
  2  there is arguably a close relationship between leadership and management. however, it does 
not follow that every leader is a manager. 
  3   due to its complex and variable nature, there are many alternative ways of analysing leader-
ship and diff erent approaches to study of the subject area. 
  4  a simple threefold heading of leadership behaviour is authoritarian, democratic or laissez-faire. 
Four main styles of leadership are tells, sells, consults and joins.  
  5   Contingency theories draw attention to major variables and forces in the situation as one of 
the main forces infl uencing the nature of managerial behaviour. 
  6  attention has been focused on charisma, leaders creating a vision with which others can iden-
tify, and inspiring followers to improve organisational performance. 
  7  Leadership is a dynamic form of behaviour. the leadership relationship is a social process 
dependent upon the type of power and infl uence exercised over other people. 
  8  attention needs to be given to the criteria for leadership eff ectiveness and sets of skills to work 
within less hierarchical-based systems of command and control. 
  9  there is no one ‘best’ form or style of leadership. there are many variables that underlie the 
eff ectiveness of leadership, including national culture. 
  10  Leadership development needs to emphasise interpersonal skills and recognise that successful 
leadership behaviour is a product of the total leadership situation.

 On 4 July 2012, Bob Diamond, the former Group Chief 
Executive (GCE) of Barclays, who had resigned a few days 
earlier, was asked by Labour MP John Mann at a Treasury 
Select Committee hearing whether he could name the 
three Quaker values that had inspired the founders of 
Barclays. He could not, prompting this retort from Mann: 
 Honesty. Integrity. Plain dealing. That’s the ethos of 
the bank you’ve just spent two hours telling us is doing 
so well – in fact so well that I wonder why you’ve not 
received an extra bonus rather than the sack. 75 
 Diamond’s replacement was Antony Jenkins, who was 
appointed in August 2012. The appointment was hailed

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
as a new chapter for the beleaguered bank, with press 
reports highlighting Jenkins’ career experience at Bar-
clays and Citibank,76 his distinctly unflashy image and 
his solid track record of effectiveness, most recently at 
Barclaycard.77
Barclays under Diamond
The events that led to this remarkable transition can be 
briefly summarised. Bob Diamond had joined Barclays 
in 1996 and rose to head Barclays Capital, its invest-
ment banking78 arm. An American by birth, his earlier 
career in the banking industry with Morgan Stanley and 
CS First Boston was in investment banking. Investment 
banking is mainly concerned with assisting individu-
als, businesses and governments to raise capital. These 
operations are important for the creation and growth 
of businesses, and although they are relatively risky, 
they can generate very high rewards. Retail or ‘personal’ 
banking, by contrast, involves providing banking ser-
vices such as current and savings accounts, mortgages, 
loans, credit card operations, etc., directly to individual 
or business customers. Risks are lower, but so are poten-
tial profits. Barclays was a straightforward retail bank 
until the 1980s when changes to banking regulations 
gave it the opportunity to move into investment bank-
ing, which it did with some limited success.
When Diamond became CEO his priorities reflected 
his career background; his ambition for the company 
was to grow Barclays Capital into an operation that 
could rival the global banks of Wall Street. Follow-
ing the financial crash of 2008, Barclays acquired the 
remains of Lehman Brothers’ US operations for what 
looked (at the time) like a bargain price. In 2011, he was 
appointed GCE of Barclays, and in the same year deliv-
ered the BBC inaugural Today Business Lecture in which 
he argued for the importance of investment bank-
ing to the growth and development of businesses and 
economies.79 However, Diamond’s style at Barclays was 
not universally popular and he was criticised for his very 
high pay levels and his apparent lack of humility; how-
ever, those criticisms became more focused as a series 
of scandals emerged in the banking industry. Many of 
these scandals – for example, the mis-selling of Pay-
ment Protection Insurance – involved a wide range of 
banks, but the UK’s Financial Services Authority’s report 
into the manipulation of the key interest rate known as 
LIBOR80 was particularly critical of the behaviour of Bar-
clays employees. By the summer of 2012, in the face of 
pressure from both the Bank of England and the Finan-
cial Services Authority,81 the Barclays board bowed to 
the inevitable and Diamond resigned. In his evidence 
to the Select Committee, he remained adamant that he 
had not known about much of the malpractice, which 
led John Mann to suggest that:
He was either in there doing it or deliberately turned 
a blind eye, or he was so useless that he couldn’t see 
fiddling on his own trading floor [. . . ] I think he must 
have known what was going on.82
Barclays under Jenkins
It is probably fair to say that the job of a bank CEO in 
the wake of such scandal is not only difficult, but also 
carried out under fairly hostile public scrutiny. Leading a 
successful organisation might be a tough job, but what 
are the leadership challenges faced by those attempt-
ing to restore damaged and unpopular organisations, 
and what qualities and behaviours are needed in such 
circumstances?
When Antony Jenkins became CEO in 2012 there 
were reports that the bank had struggled to find a suc-
cessor, and that two of the most credible candidates 
had already turned down the job before Jenkins was 
approached. Unusually for a bank CEO, he is not an 
investment banker; he ran Barclays credit card opera-
tions and had also managed the retail arm of the busi-
ness. The contrast with Diamond was clear:
In Jenkins you’ve got the archetypal English CEO who 
is seen as rather safe, compared with the typically 
aggressive US investment banker that was Bob 
Diamond. His appointment signals that the bank is not 
going to be as brazen as it has been in the past.83
He has been described as the ‘nice guy’ of banking, a 
calm, softly spoken and mild-mannered individual who, 
nevertheless, could be ‘scary’. He explains this by saying:
What that means is you don’t have to raise your voice 
or thump the table to get your point across. When you 
have a very measured style, you don’t need to shout.

You just need to make your point a little more directly 
and people notice.84
In an early move to signal his views about the bank’s 
road ahead, Jenkins circulated a letter to all 140,000 staff 
emphasising his commitment to restoring its integrity 
and reputation by a return to five ‘core’ values: respect, 
integrity, service, excellence and stewardship. He 
warned that:
There might be some who don’t feel they can fully buy 
into an approach which so squarely links performance 
to the upholding of our values. My message to those 
people is simply: Barclays is not the place for you. The 
rules have changed. You won’t feel comfortable at 
Barclays and, to be frank, we won’t feel comfortable 
with you as colleagues.85
The strategy is known as the ‘TRANSFORM’86 pro-
gramme, which aims to reinvigorate the bank not only 
morally but also commercially. To that end he has said 
that he would not indulge underperforming parts of 
the company, essentially the investment bank for which 
Diamond had such great ambitions. In 2014 Jenkins 
announced a three-year programme of job cuts that 
would see Barclays Capital lose 7,000 staff – a quarter 
of its workforce – as part of a general restructuring and 
simplification programme.
In the future, Barclays will be leaner, stronger, much 
better balanced and well positioned to deliver lower 
volatility, higher returns, and growth.87
In 2015 he continued to assert that he would not be 
‘patient’ with poor returns from any part of the bank; 
again it was Barclays Capital that was underperform-
ing and that seemed most under threat, and its rela-
tively poor performance will clearly not be allowed to 
drag the bank down either in shareholder value or in 
reputation.88
Another contrast with the Diamond years was Jenkins’ 
decision not to take the usual banker’s bonus for his first 
two years in post. Whereas Diamond famously received 
£17 million total reward in 2011,89 the jazz-loving Jen-
kins took the relatively modest sum of £5.4 million for 
his third year as CEO, including a £1.1 million bonus pay-
ment. Even so, some commentators considered that he 
had not yet fully earned this perk as the group’s overall 
performance remained weak, particularly that of Bar-
clays Capital. Additionally profits have been undermined 
by the need to set aside significant sums to cover the cost 
of litigation and potential regulatory fines as yet more 
scandals from earlier years come to light.90
Jenkins is seen as the ‘clean-up guy’ at Barclays. He 
has made a number of painful and important changes 
but the company is not yet out of the woods. It is still 
one of the most complained-about banks in the UK, the 
investment arm remains under serious threat and the 
shadows of its past misbehaviour still loom large. The 
challenge for Barclays continues, and it remains to be 
seen whether Jenkins’ leadership can restore its good 
name and commercial fortunes.*
 Tasks
	 1	 To what extent could it be argued that Diamond was a leader but Jenkins is a manager? Explain your view 
with reference to concepts from the chapter.
	 2	 Examine the tasks facing each of the two CEOs of Barclays at different points in the company’s history. How 
did the business environment affect the requirements of leadership? Use one of the contingency models 
outlined in the chapter to explain your view.
	 3	 Discuss the proposition that although Jenkins has adopted a strategy of transformation at Barclays, he is in 
fact a transactional, not a transformational, leader.
	 4	 How many of the characteristics and behaviours of servant leadership (as identified by Spears and Yukl) can 
be identified in Jenkins’ approach at Barclays? Explain which you think are present, and which are missing.
	 5	 How far do you think cultural difference between the American and British approaches to banking and 
business contributed to the problems encountered by Diamond?
*  The Barclays story continues to get more interesting, and you might like to catch up with the events of July 2015 when 
Jenkins was fired by the new Chairman, John McFarlane (see, for instance, the summary by Kamal Ahmed, Business 
Editor for the BBC, on 8 July 2015, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33438914).

  CHAPTER 10 
 Understanding management 
 management is fundamental to the eff ective operation of work 
organisations. it is by the process of management and execution of 
work that the activities of the organisation are carried out. management 
is essentially an integrating activity that permeates every facet of the 
operations of an organisation. Attention must be given to the manner in 
which management is exercised and forms of managerial behaviour. 
 Learning outcomes 
 After completing this chapter you should have enhanced your ability to: 
 ●  explain the main activities and processes of management; 
 ●  analyse the essential nature of managerial work; 
 ●  contrast management in private-enterprise and public-sector organisations; 
 ●  outline empirical studies on the nature of managerial work; 
 ●  examine styles of managerial behaviour; 
 ●  debate suggested philosophies for managing with and through people; 
 ●  review the importance and future of management. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 managers do not really have much influence. they follow where the organisation appears to be going, and avoid 
upsetting other people or making serious errors. People regarded as good managers are usually those who are 
remembered as not being bad managers. 
 How far do YOU agree with this assertion? What is YOUR experience of a good manager? 

350
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
The importance of management
Organisations can only achieve their goals and objectives through the co-ordinated efforts of their 
members. It is by the process of management and execution of work that the activities of the 
organisation are carried out. Effective management is clearly essential for organisational success.
In certain respects everyone can be regarded as a manager. We all manage our own time and 
everyone has some choice whether or not to do something, and some control, however slight, 
over the planning and organisation of their work. However, we are concerned with manage-
ment as involving people looking beyond themselves and exercising formal authority over the 
activities and performance of other people.
Even within a work organisation one cannot necessarily identify a manager by what a per-
son is called or by their job title. In some organisations there is a liberal use of the title ‘man-
ager’ in an apparent attempt to enhance the status and morale of staff. As a result there are 
a number of people whose job title includes the term ‘manager’ but who, in reality, are not 
performing the full activities of a manager. Yet there are many people whose job title does not 
include the term ‘manager’ but who, in terms of the activities they undertake and the authority 
and responsibility they exercise, may be very much a manager.
Management as making things happen
For our purposes, therefore, we can regard management as:
● taking place within a structured organisational setting with prescribed roles;
● directed towards the attainment of aims and objectives;
● achieved through the efforts of other people; and
● using systems and procedures.
At its most basic, management may be viewed as ‘making things happen’. Recall also the dis-
cussion on the nature of leadership (see Chapter 9). Whereas leaders are not necessarily man-
agers, it could be argued that all managers should be leaders.
It is the responsibility of management to manage. But organisations can achieve their aims 
and objectives only through the co-ordinated efforts of their members. This involves good 
people management.
A heavy responsibility is placed on managers and the activity of management – on the pro-
cesses, systems and styles of management. Attention must be given to the work environment and 
appropriate systems of motivation, job satisfaction and rewards. It is important to remember 
that improvement in organisational performance will come about only through the people who 
are the organisation. It is also important to bear in mind that the activity of management takes 
place within the broader context of the organisational setting and subject to the organisational 
environment and culture. There are also variations in systems and styles of management and 
in the choice of managerial behaviour. Figure 10.1 shows a basic five-stage framework of study.

Chapter 10  Understanding management
351
But what is management?
Management is a generic term and subject to many interpretations. A number of contrasting 
ideas are attributed to the meaning of management and to the work of a manager.1 There are 
also different ways of viewing the study and knowledge of management. Drucker sees man-
agement as denoting a function as well as the people who discharge it, a social position and 
authority, and also a discipline and field of study: ‘Management is tasks. Management is a dis-
cipline. But management is also people. Every achievement of management is the achievement 
of a manager. Every failure is a failure of a manager.’2
Significance of cultural influences
Schneider and Barsoux contend that trying to define the meaning of management shows up 
differences in beliefs and values. Cultural influences are a significant feature of management. 
Managers in some countries might have more concern for the ‘spiritual’ aspects of manage-
ment, while in others there would be greater concern for the business sense. Developing people 
through work could be seen as an intrusion of privacy, and others may perceive empowerment 
as another name for manipulation.3 According to Francesco and Gold, if international manag-
ers are to perform successfully in the global economy they need to understand the effects of 
different cultures on organisational behaviour. Reliance on theories developed in one culture 
is not sufficient.4
Managers born or made? Management an art or science?
There is frequent debate about whether managers are born or made or whether management 
is an art or a science. Briefly, the important point is that neither of these is a mutually exclusive 
alternative. Even if there are certain innate qualities that make for a potentially good manager, 
these natural talents must be encouraged and developed through proper guidance, education 
and training, and planned experience. Clearly, management must always be something of an 
art, especially in so far as it involves practice, personal judgement and dealing with people. 
However, it still requires knowledge of the fundamentals of management, and competence in 
the application of specific skills and techniques – as illustrated, for example, with develop-
ments in IT.
The trouble is that, for all the techniques at their disposal, managers generally act at a very 
intuitive level. Managers may have absorbed the latest thinking on core competencies, but 
are more likely to base a decision on prejudice or personal opinion rather than a neat theory.5
The discussion of management as an art or a science is developed by Watson, who suggests 
that in order to make sense of the complex and highly ambiguous situations in which manag-
ers find themselves, management can be viewed not only as both art and science, but also as 
magic and politics (see Figure 10.2).6
Two views on management as a science
Dib provides an account of hearing contrasting views on management as a science. One view 
is yes – there is clearly science in management although a purely scientific approach omits 
human beings as the most important factor. Management is about the application of knowl-
edge: ‘The most successful managers are those who use scientific models, theories and con-
cepts, and then apply them using their own style, experience and personality.’ The other view 
is no – both management and science apply and extend our knowledge, but management needs 
more than just observations and experiments and needs to be based on practice, reflection and 
action. Management is too eclectic to be a science in itself: ‘The very nature of management 
means that without applying and reflecting upon the practice of management we will be more 
inclined to measure than to take action’.7

 Thinking about management at university level 
 Foppen questions the relationship between management practice and education, and whether 
management has not always been illusory. However, Foppen emphasises the importance of 
management performance. 
 Management is of pivotal importance for modern society. It is for this reason that, no matter 
what, thinking about management, certainly at university level, is of great relevance to man-
agement practice. So apart from the question of whether management’s claim that it is indis-
pensable is really valid or not, the fact that practically everyone believes it is, is what counts. 8

 Critical review and refl ection 
 According to Foppen, management is of pivotal importance for modern society and thinking about management at 
university level is of great relevance to management practice. 
 To what extent is YOUR course of study encouraging YOU to think about management? How do YOU see the relation-
ship between management practice and management education?

The nature of management is variable. It is not a separate, discrete function but relates to all 
activities of the organisation. It cannot be departmentalised or centralised. With the possible 
exception of the board of directors, or similar, an organisation cannot have a department of 
management in the same way as it can have a department for other functions, such as research 
and development, production, marketing or finance. Management is seen best, therefore, as 
a process common to all other functions carried out within the organisation. Through the 
execution of work, the central focus of management is on achieving the goals and objectives 
of the organisation, and satisfying the needs and expectations of its members. As mentioned 
earlier (Chapter 1), management is essentially an integrating activity (see Figure 10.3).
But what does the process of management actually involve and what activities does it 
encompass? Management is a complex and discursive subject. Moreover, ‘management’ is not 
homogeneous. It takes place in different ways and at different levels of the organisation. One 
approach, especially favoured by classical writers, is to analyse the nature of management 
and to search for common activities (or functions, or elements) applicable to managers in all 
organisations.

Common activities of management
One of the first, and most widely quoted, analyses is that given by Henri Fayol (1841–1925), 
who divided the managerial activity into five elements of management, defined as: ‘to forecast 
and plan, to organise, to command, to co-ordinate and to control’:9
● Forecasting and planning – examining the future, deciding what needs to be achieved and 
developing a plan of action.
● Organising – providing the material and human resources and building the structure to 
carry out the activities of the organisation.
● Commanding – maintaining activity among personnel, getting the optimum return from all 
employees in the interests of the whole organisation.
● Co-ordinating – unifying and harmonising all activities and efforts of the organisation to 
facilitate its working and success.
● Controlling – verifying that everything occurs in accordance with plans, instructions, estab-
lished principles and expressed commands.
Principles of management
Fayol also suggests that a set of well-established principles would help concentrate general 
discussion on management theory. He emphasises, however, that these principles must be flex-
ible and adaptable to changing circumstances. Fayol recognised that there was no limit to the 
principles of management but in his writing advocated fourteen of them:
  	1.	  Division of work. The object is to produce more and better work from the same effort, 
and the advantages of specialisation. However, there are limits to division of work, which 
experience and a sense of proportion tell us should not be exceeded.
	  2.  Authority and responsibility. Responsibility is the corollary of authority. Wherever 
authority is exercised, responsibility arises. The application of sanctions is essential to 
good management, and is needed to encourage useful actions and to discourage their 
opposite. The best safeguard against abuse of authority is the personal integrity of the 
manager.
	  3.	  Discipline is essential for the efficient operation of the organisation. Discipline is, in 
essence, the outward mark of respect for agreements between the organisation and its 
members. The manager must decide on the most appropriate form of sanction in cases of 
offences against discipline.
	  4.	  Unity of command. In any action an employee should receive orders from one superior 
only; if not, authority is undermined and discipline, order and stability threatened. Dual 
command is a perpetual source of conflicts.
	  5.	  Unity of direction. In order to provide for unity of action, co-ordination and focusing of 
effort, there should be one head and one plan for any group of activities with the same 
objective.
	  6.  Subordination of individual interest to general interest. The interest of the organisation 
should dominate individual or group interests.
	  7.  Remuneration of personnel. Remuneration should as far as possible satisfy both employee 
and employer. Methods of payment can influence organisational performance and the 
method should be fair and should encourage keenness by rewarding well-directed effort, 
but not lead to overpayment.
	  8.  Centralisation is always present to some extent in any organisation. The degree of cen-
tralisation is a question of proportion and will vary in particular organisations.
	  9.  Scalar chain – the chain of superiors from the ultimate authority to the lowest ranks. 
Respect for line authority must be reconciled with activities that require urgent 
action, and with the need to provide for some measure of initiative at all levels of 
authority.

  10.  Order. This includes material order and social order. The object of material order is 
avoidance of loss. There should be an appointed place for each thing, and each thing in 
its appointed place. Social order involves an appointed place for each employee, and each 
employee in their appointed place. Social order requires good organisation and good 
selection.  
  11.   Equity. The desire for equity and for equality of treatment are aspirations to be taken into 
account in dealing with employees throughout all levels of the scalar chain. 
  12.   Stability of tenure of personnel. Generally, prosperous organisations have stable manage-
rial personnel, but changes of personnel are inevitable and stability of tenure is a question 
of proportion. 
  13.   Initiative. This represents a source of strength for the organisation and should be encour-
aged and developed. Tact and integrity are required to promote initiative and to retain 
respect for authority and discipline. 
  14.   Esprit de corps  should be fostered, as harmony and unity among members of the 
organisation are a great strength in the organisation. The principle of unity of com-
mand should be observed. It is necessary to avoid the dangers of divide and rule of one’s 
own team, and the abuse of written communication. Wherever possible, verbal contacts 
should be used.  
 A number of these principles relate directly to, or are infl uenced by, the organisation structure 
in which the process of management takes place. 
 Relevance today 
 Inevitably there are doubts about the relevance of these activities and principles today, but it is 
hard to argue against their continuing, underlying importance. What is perhaps debatable is 
the manner of their interpretation and implementation.  McLean maintains that although pro-
posed almost a hundred years ago, Fayol’s defi nition of management remains one of the most 
cited of modern times. Fayol has left an indelible mark on management history, and forged an 
inextricable link between the manager and the organisation. 10 
 Hamel suggests that there would be little argument from modern-day executives about 
Fayol’s description of the work of a manager, but puts forward his own synthesis of what the 
 practice of management entails:  
 ●  Setting and programming  objective 
 ●  Motivating and aligning  eﬀ ort 
 ●  Co-ordinating and controlling  activities 
 ●  Developing and assigning  talent 
 ●  Accumulating and applying  knowledge 
 ●  Amassing and allocating  resources 
 ●  Building and nurturing  relationships 
 ●  Balancing and meeting  stakeholder demands. 11 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 despite criticisms of the prescriptive nature of activities and principles of management, they do provide important 
guidelines for establishing a framework within which the work of an organisation is carried out.

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
Responsibility for the work of other people
Yet another approach to describing management is given by Drucker, who identifies three 
tasks, equally important but essentially different, that have to be performed:
	1.	 Fulfilling the specific purpose and mission of the institution, whether business enterprise, 
hospital or university.
	2.	 Making work productive and the worker achieving.
	3.	 Managing social impacts and social responsibilities.12
Drucker also argued that the traditional definition of management based on the responsibility 
for the work of other people is unsatisfactory and too narrow, and emphasises a secondary 
rather than a primary characteristic. There are people, often in responsible positions, who 
are clearly ‘management’ but who do not have responsibility for the work of other people. A 
person’s function and contribution may be unaffected by the number of subordinate staff. A 
‘manager’ is someone who performs the tasks of management whether or not they have power 
over others.
Who is a manager can be defined only by that person’s function and by the contribution he 
or she is expected to make. And the function that distinguishes the manager above all oth-
ers is the function no one but the manager can perform. The one contribution a manager is 
uniquely expected to make is to give others vision and ability to perform. It is vision and moral 
responsibility that, in the last analysis, define the manager.13
Drucker was, according to Stern, a visionary predicting future trends ahead of the rest and 
dealing with big ideas but in a practical and down-to-earth way. His work and insights have 
lasted. Drucker was arguably the foremost thinker on management and business of the twen-
tieth century and we need him as much as ever.14
Essential nature of managerial work
Despite the view expressed by Drucker (in 1977) on the tasks and contribution of a man-
ager, one of the most popular ways of defining management today is that it involves getting 
work done second-hand – that is, through the efforts of other people. Managers are judged, 
ultimately, not just on their own performance but on the results achieved by subordinate 
staff. If we look at how people at work actually spend their time, we should be able to 
distinguish between those whose main occupation is the carrying out of discrete tasks and 
the actual doing of work themselves, and those who spend proportionally more of their 
time in determining the nature of work to be undertaken by other people, the planning and 
organising of their work, providing directions and advice and guidance, and checking on 
their performance.
‘Managing’ and ‘doing’
By distinguishing ‘managing’ from ‘doing’ in this way, we can see management as clarifying 
objectives and the planning of work, organising the distribution of activities and tasks to 
other people, direction of subordinate staff and controlling the performance of other people’s 
work. This provides us with a convenient description and summary of managerial work as the 
clarification of objectives, planning, organising, directing and controlling (see Figure 10.4). 
The degree of emphasis given to these different activities may vary widely, however, from one 
manager to another. Some managers are likely to spend more time on certain activities than 

Chapter 10  Understanding management
357
other managers. The application of these activities reflects a wide range of organisational 
situations, management practice and managerial style.
Direction, motivation or leadership?
It is tempting to use the term ‘motivating’ or ‘leading’, as preferred by some other writers, 
instead of ‘directing’ as is shown in our definition of the activities of management above. 
Motivation and leadership are perhaps less emotive words, but is either an adequate descrip-
tion? It is certainly part of the manager’s job to motivate staff, but it also involves develop-
ment and guidance. Staff need to perform well in the right areas, and to be effective as well as 
efficient. Leadership is clearly important but the efforts of staff need to be directed towards 
the achievement of given objectives in accordance with stated policy. This involves the process 
of control. It is acknowledged that control is another emotive word and some writers prefer 
alternatives such as monitoring, inspecting or checking – although, whatever the wording, the 
functions that it embraces are usually very similar. The real importance is not the particular 
term itself but what it is intended to achieve and the manner in which ‘control’ is exercised (see 
Chapter 13). For example, according to Sir Alex Ferguson:
Management is all about control. Success gives you control and control gives you longevity as 
a manager. In football very few managers achieve a position of complete control over their 
teams.15

 The eﬀ orts of other people 
 Stewart attempts to integrate the various defi nitions of management and summarises the man-
ager’s job, broadly defi ned as: 
  deciding what should be done and then getting other people to do it. A longer defi nition 
would be concerned with how these tasks are to be accomplished. The fi rst task comprises 
setting objectives, planning (including decision-making), and setting up formal organization. 
The second consists of motivation, communication, control (including measurement), and the 
development of people. The two tasks are separated for convenient analysis, but in practice 
they may often overlap. 16 
 Folklore and facts of managing 
 Mintzberg suggests that the basic processes of managing do not change much over time. But 
he refers to the folklore and facts of managing. 
 We have this common image of the manager, especially in a senior job, as a refl ective, sys-
tematic planner ‘sitting at a desk, thinking grand thoughts, making great decisions, and, 
above all, systematically planning out the future.’ There is a good deal of evidence about this, 
but not a shred of it supports this image. 
 Facts: Study after study has shown that 
 (a) 
 managers work at an unrelenting pace; 
 (b) 
 their activities are typically characterized by brevity, variety, fragmentation, and dis-
continuity; and 
 (c) 
 they are strongly oriented to action. 17 
  Management in private-enterprise and 
public-sector organisations 
 The general movement of major organisations away from direct governmental control to 
greater responsibility for managing their own aff airs has led to blurring of the traditional dis-
tinction between the private and public sectors  (see discussion in  Chapter  3 ). There are, how-
ever, still perceived diff erences between management in the private and public sectors. These 
diff erences arise from particular features of public-sector organisations. For example: 
 ●  aims concerned with providing a service for, and for the well-being of, the community 
rather than just of a commercial nature; 
 ●  the scale, variety and complexity of their operations; 
 ●  the tendency for them to be subject more to press reports on their activities; 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the idea of ‘getting work done through the efforts of other people’ may not satisfy all possible criteria for the role 
of the manager. it does, however, have the advantage of simplicity and focuses on what in reality is at the heart of 
effective management. 
 What do YOU think? Do YOU agree with Drucker that this defi nition is unsatisfactory? How would YOU defi ne the 
true meaning of management? 

Chapter 10  Understanding management
359
● the political environment in which they operate, and in the case of local government, for 
example, the relationship between elected members and permanent officers;
● high levels of statutory regulations, legislation and ministerial guidance;
● the generally high level of trade union involvement;
● difficulties in measuring standards of performance of services provided compared with 
profitability;
● demand for uniformity of treatment and public accountability for their operations;
● tendency towards more rigid HR policies – for example, specific limitations on levels of 
authority and responsibility, fixed salary grades based on general pay scales, long-term 
career structures and set promotion procedures.
A number of these features frequently combine to result in increased bureaucracy within 
­public-sector organisations.
Same general problems of management
Both private-enterprise and public-sector organisations, however, face the same general prob-
lems of management. Both are concerned with, for example:
● the clarification of aims and objectives;
● the design of a suitable structure;
● carrying out essential administrative functions; and
● the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations.
Basic principles of management apply in any series of activities in any organisation. Although 
actual methods and procedures will of necessity differ, the common activities and concerns of 
management apply to a greater or lesser extent in both private-enterprise and public-sector 
organisations. However, as Walker points out:
Despite the talent in all three sectors of the economy, cultural differences, alien working prac-
tices and even mutual suspicion mean moving between the private, public and voluntary 
sectors can be a bumpy ride.
Beyond differences in management styles, a key factor is that in the private sector there is more 
of a strategic focus, while in the public sector it is much more about here and now. Nine out 
of ten private-sector employers would be unlikely to take employees offloaded from the public 
sector.18 
I don’t have to make a profit. I don’t pay dividends. And I don’t have shareholders or owners in the strictest sense 
of the word. I am less exposed to the market and less exposed to financial pressures brought to bear externally. 
You could argue that this could lead to financial indiscipline. But I would argue that it enables me to spend what 
I need to spend to deliver the service required. And if there is an excess, I give it back. To say the private sector is 
always cheaper is a very broad and sweeping statement, particularly if you consider it in the context of PFI (Private 
Finance Initiative) arrangements. You have to look at the whole life cycle of a contract if you are to evaluate it 
properly.
I don’t doubt that as markets mature, new providers will develop the necessary expertise, but when you are deal-
ing with public safety, public protection and reoffending you need a proven and trusted supplier. That’s what the 
public sector offers.

 Importance of skills and behaviour 
 A report from the CIPD points out that although public services are not homogeneous and 
specifi c issues facing managers will diff er between sectors and localities, there is a shared 
agenda in improving people management in the public-sector workplaces. It is important to 
recognise that without more eff ective people management, there is no chance of introducing 
positive and lasting change. Management need to support and empower front-line staff . The 
report makes clear that: 
 an improvement in the quality of people management, particularly among line manag-
ers and supervisors, is central to more eff ective delivery of public services and greater local 
accountability. Inadequate people management skills are also often at the heart of cata-
strophic service failure. 19 
 Sir Howard Bernstein refers to the challenging economic climate that has focused the public 
sector on the need for radical reform to tackle the cost pressures on it and the development 
of the skills to deliver public-sector reform. Signifi cant long-term culture change is required 
across a range of partners to overcome professional, organisational and technical barriers. All 
levels of managers and leaders have a vital role in delivering community services in a more 
integrated way. 
  This type of reform will require diff erent skills and behaviours across all levels of manage-
ment. Some of the key leadership and management skills necessary for public service reform 
include the ability to adapt; to lead across organisational boundaries; to exert infl uence out-
side traditional hierarchies; to demonstrate political intelligence; and the ability to engage 
with the community. 20  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the basis of ownership and finance, public accountability, demand for uniformity of treatment and the political envi-
ronment in which they work mean the nature of management in the public sector is fundamentally different from 
that in the private sector. 
 To what extent are YOU able to challenge this assertion? Do YOU think there are more similarities or diff erences 
between management in the two sectors? 
 Public service shouldn’t be dirty words. Public servants work on behalf of the public and are proud of that. Busi-
nesses are there to make a profi t – that’s an absolute truth. But freed up from those constraints, i’m here to deliver 
a public service – and there is a clear distinction between those two priorities. they can be confl icting at worst; at a 
minimum they can create tension. 
 Any organisation, whether public or private, needs to be showing best value for money against the highest stan-
dard of delivery. so my position here has been to deliver public services while applying commercial disciplines in 
the way that we operate – ensuring we always get the best provider of services, whether internal or external, and 
that contracts are hard negotiated and hard applied. We view public money not as a right, but something to be 
managed with great prudence and on which to maximise return. What we mustn’t lose sight of is the fact that what 
we are providing is public services. How that is delivered is really not the issue. it’s about the quality of the service 
and the price.

 Putting the customer ﬁ rst in a service organisation: cultural change 
at Fareham Borough Council 
 Faced with continual economic pressure, how does a thriving borough council change the culture of the organisation in a 
way that results in improved customer service and delivers eﬃ  ciency savings? Fareham Borough Council is located along 
the south coast of Hampshire with a growing population, currently 112,800. The biennial Residents’ Survey shows existing 
high levels of customer satisfaction; the 2013 survey identiﬁ ed that over 90 per cent of residents were happy with the way 
that Fareham Borough Council runs things. With such a high level of satisfaction, the need for further improvement or the 
possibility of doing so might be questioned; however, the purpose of the work being undertaken is to drive out compla-
cency and ensure that satisfaction does not decline in the future and customers receive the best service possible. 
 Cultural change is diﬃ  cult to achieve, but Fareham Borough Council is using a unique approach to achieving cul-
tural transformation by putting the customer at the core of its work. Services are being redesigned to drive out waste 
and focus on working with an understanding of what matters to the customer. Driven from the top by the Leader of 
the Council and the Chief Executive, the Council is using the Vanguard Method. 
 Service is diﬀ erent to manufacturing. In simple terms there is inherently greater variety in customer demand, 
hence the need to design to absorb that variety. The Vanguard Method transfers expertise to people (managers 
and staﬀ ) in the organisation and helps change from command and control to a systems approach to the design 
and management of work. Emphasis is placed on the customer and measurement of success as opposed to targets 
of expected performance. Rather than concern with individual functions or activities, the organisation is viewed as 
an integrated system. The focus of attention is predominately on the ﬂ ow of the needs of the customer throughout 
the system. Vanguard uses guides, people who are experts in both intervention theory (how to make a change) and 
systems theory (how to analyse and design work).  (See also discussion in  Chapter  2 .) 
 The results 
 Unlike its traditional application, which is focused on a single service area, Fareham Borough Council has imple-
mented a programme that will see all services reviewed across the whole organisation. Each of the interventions is 
being led by a Head of Service to provide support to the employees involved and ensure buy-in at all levels of the 
organisation. Analysing a service from a customer’s perspective has revealed dramatic ways to change the way ser-
vices are delivered. The points below indicate the services being reviewed and key improvements identiﬁ ed so far: 
 ●  Housing repairs – The average time to complete a day-to-day repair on a council property has fallen from 89 
days to less than 8 days. This length of time is from when the customer reports the repair, up to when the repair 
is complete and stays ﬁ xed. Tradespeople are able to access a customer’s property on the ﬁ rst visit in over 97 per 
cent of cases. This demonstrates the success of customers advising the council when it is convenient to them for 
tradespeople to attend. Changes in the approach to electrical testing are expected to deliver savings of approxi-
mately £88,000 per annum (50 per cent of the original cost); savings of approximately £30,000 are also antici-
pated following changes to the testing of emergency lighting. 
 ●  Planning applications – Average time taken to process applications has dropped from 56 days to 36. 
 ●  Beneﬁ ts – The time taken to process new beneﬁ t claims has fallen from approximately 20 days to 6 days. Cus-
tomers now deal with a single employee as handoﬀ s are virtually non-existent. 
 ●  Parking enforcement – The number of Informal Challenges to Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) has dropped from 
45 per week to 23. This demonstrates how the Parking Enforcement Oﬃ  cers are making better decisions when 
issuing a PCN. 
 Conclusion 
 By engaging with every employee and understanding what matters to customers, the Council has been able to aﬀ ect 
a cultural change at all levels of the organisation. In the ﬁ rst year of the programme, the Council is already seeing 
signiﬁ cant improvements in customer service and has been able to capture savings of £381,000 per annum.

 The work of a manager 
 Despite similarities in the general activities of management, the jobs of individual managers 
will diff er widely. In practice, it will be infl uenced by such factors as: 
 ●  the nature of the organisation, its culture, philosophy, objectives and size; 
 ●  the type of structure; 
 ●  activities and tasks involved; 
 ●  technology and methods of performing work; 
 ●  the nature of people employed; and 
 ●  the level in the organisation at which the manager is working. 
 These diff erences do not just exist between organisations in the private and public sectors; 
they are often more a matter of degree. For example, many large business organisations may 
have more in common in their management and operations with public-sector organisations 
than with small private fi rms. 
 The environmental setting 
 A major determinant of the work of the manager is the nature of the environment, both inter-
nal and external, in which the manager is working. Managers have to perform their jobs in the 
situation in which they fi nd themselves ( see  Figure  10.5 ). 
 Tasks 
  1.  What do you think are the main reasons for the key improvements identifi ed by Fareham Borough Council? 
  2.  discuss critically how you view the idea of culture change with management based on the fl ow of customer 
needs rather than individual functions or activities. 
  3.  to what extent do you think managing through putting the customer fi rst could, or should, be applied meaning-
fully to your university or organisation? 
 Figure 10.5  the work of a manager: the environmental setting 

Chapter 10  Understanding management
363
The internal environment relates to the culture and climate of the organisation – ‘how 
things are done around here’ – and to the prevailing atmosphere surrounding the organisa-
tion. (Organisational culture and climate are discussed in Chapter 15.) The external envi-
ronment relates to the organisation as an open system (discussed in Chapter 3). Managers 
must be responsive to the changing opportunities and challenges, and risks and limitations, 
facing the organisation. External environmental factors are largely outside the control of 
management.
The diversity of management
Studies on the nature of management have been based on wider observation and research, 
and have concentrated on the diversity of management and differences in the jobs of manag-
ers. Among the best-known empirical studies on the nature of managers’ jobs, and how man-
agers actually spend their time, are those by Henry Mintzberg, John Kotter and Rosemary 
Stewart.21
Managerial roles
Based on the study of the work of five chief executives of medium-sized to large organisations, 
Mintzberg classifies the activities that constitute the essential functions of a top manager’s 
job.22 What managers do cannot be related to the classical view of the activities of manage-
ment. The manager’s job can be described more meaningfully in terms of various ‘roles’ or 
organised sets of behaviour associated with a position.23 Mintzberg recognises that people 
who ‘manage’ have formal authority over the unit they command and this leads to a special 
position of status in the organisation.
As a result of this formal authority and status, managerial activities can be seen as a set of 
ten managerial roles, which may be divided into three groups:
● interpersonal roles;
● informational roles; and
● decisional roles.
Interpersonal roles
The interpersonal roles are relations with other people arising from the manager’s status and 
authority:
	1.	 Figurehead role is the most basic and simple of managerial roles. The manager is a symbol 
and represents the organisation in matters of formality, participation as a social necessity 
and being available for people who insist on access to the ‘top’.
	2.	 Leader role is among the most significant of roles and permeates all activities of a man-
ager. By virtue of the authority vested in the manager, there is a responsibility for staffing, 
and for the motivation and guidance of subordinates.
	3.	 Liaison role involves the manager in horizontal relationships with individuals and groups 
outside the manager’s own unit or the organisation. An important part of the manager’s 
job is the linking between the organisation and the environment.
Informational roles
The informational roles relate to the sources and communication of information arising from 
the manager’s interpersonal roles:
	1.	 Monitor role identifies the manager in seeking and receiving information to develop an 
understanding of the working of the organisation and its environment. Information may 
be received from internal or external sources, and may be formal or informal.

364
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
	2.	 Disseminator role involves the manager in transmitting external information through the 
liaison role into the organisation, and internal information through the leader role between 
the subordinates. The information may be largely factual or may contain value judgements.
	3.	 Spokesperson role involves the manager as formal authority in transmitting information 
to people outside the unit and the general public such as suppliers, customers, government 
departments and the press.
Decisional roles
The decisional roles involve the making of strategic organisational decisions on the basis of 
the manager’s status and authority, and access to information:
	1.	 Entrepreneurial role is the manager’s function to initiate and plan controlled change 
through exploiting opportunities or solving problems, and taking action to improve the 
existing situation.
	2.	 Disturbance handler role involves the manager in reacting to involuntary situations and 
unpredictable events. When an unexpected disturbance occurs the manager must take 
action to correct the situation.
	3.	 Resource allocator role involves the manager in using formal authority to decide where 
effort will be expended, and making choices on the allocation of resources such as money, 
time, materials and staff.
	4.	 Negotiator role is participation in negotiation activity with other individuals or organisa-
tions. Because of the manager’s authority, credibility, access to information and responsi-
bility for resource allocation, negotiation is an important part of the job.
Mintzberg emphasises that this set of ten roles is a somewhat arbitrary division of the man-
ager’s activities. It presents one of many possible ways of categorising the view of managerial 
roles. The ten roles are not easily isolated in practice but form an integrated whole. If any role 
is removed, this affects the effectiveness of the manager’s overall performance.
Why organisations need managers
As a result of describing the nature of managerial work in terms of a set of ten roles, Mintz-
berg suggests six basic purposes of the manager, or reasons why organisations need managers:
● to ensure the organisation serves its basic purpose – the efficient production of goods or services;
● to design and maintain the stability of the operations of the organisation;
● to take charge of strategy-making and adapt the organisation in a controlled way to changes 
in its environment;
● to ensure the organisation serves the ends of those people who control it;
● to serve as the key informational link between the organisation and the environment; and
● as formal authority to operate the organisation’s status system.
Agenda-setting and network-building
From a detailed study of fifteen successful American general managers involved in a broad 
range of industries, Kotter found that although their jobs differed and the managers undertook 
their jobs in a different manner, they all had two significant activities in common: agenda-
setting and network-building.24
● Agenda-setting is a constant activity of managers. This is a set of items, or series of agen-
das, involving aims and objectives, plans, strategies, ideas, decisions to be made and priori-
ties of action in order to bring about desired end results. This requires individual managers

 ●  Network-building involves the managers interacting with other people and establishing a net-
work of co-operative relations outside the formal structure. The network often includes a 
large number of people, many in addition to their boss or direct subordinates, and individuals 
and groups outside the organisation. Meetings provide exchanges of information over a wide 
range of topics in a short period of time. A major feature of network-building is to establish 
and maintain contacts that can assist in the successful achievement of agenda items.  
 Demands, constraints and choices 
 Based on earlier studies of managerial jobs,  Stewart has developed a model for understanding 
managerial work and behaviour. The model directs attention to the generalisations that can be 
made about managerial work, and diff erences that exist among managerial jobs. It acknowl-
edges the wide variety, found from previous studies, among diff erent managers in similar jobs 
in terms of how they view their jobs and the work they do. 25 
 The three main categories of the model are  demands, constraints and  choices. These iden-
tify the fl exibility in a managerial job. 
 ●  Demands are what anyone in the job has to do. They are not what the manager ought to do, 
but only what must be done: for example, meeting minimum criteria of performance, work 
that requires personal involvement, complying with bureaucratic procedures that cannot be 
avoided, meetings that must be attended. 
 ●  Constraints are internal or external factors that limit what the manager can do: for exam-
ple, resource limitations, legal or trade union constraints, the nature of technology, physi-
cal location, organisational constraints, attitudes of other people. 
 ●  Choices are the activities that the manager is free to do, but does not have to do. They are 
opportunities for one job-holder to undertake diff erent work from another, or to do the 
work in a diff erent way: for example, what work is done within a defi ned area, to change 
the area of work, the sharing of work, participation in organisational or public activities. 
 Stewart suggests that the model provides a framework for thinking about the nature of mana-
gerial jobs, and about the manner in which managers undertake them. To understand what 
managerial jobs are really like it is necessary to understand the nature of their fl exibility. 
Account should be taken of variations in behaviour and diff erences in jobs before attempting to 
generalise about managerial work. 
 An overview of management is set out in the concept map of  Figure  10.6 .  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the work of a manager is not easy to describe as aspects that are common in many applications escape us in others 
and all managers have their individual way of working. Understanding the nature of management can therefore be 
no more than a compromise between the ideas of the more lucid writers on the subject. 
 To what extent do YOU accept this view of the study of management? How would YOU explain the essential nature 
of managerial work and the role of the manager? 
  Importance of managerial style 
 There appears to be a growing recognition that managers can no longer rely solely on their 
perceived formal authority as a result of a hierarchical position in the structure of the organi-
sation. More than ever an essential ingredient of any successful manager is the ability to han-
dle people successfully. This changing relationship places a heavy responsibility on managers, 
and on the systems and styles of management adopted.

It is, however, interesting to note the views of Watson who, while acknowledging that to 
create the goods, services and quality of life that people look for in the modern world, rather 
complex patterns of co-operative behaviour have to be orchestrated and ‘managed’, identifies 
three major problems in thinking about organising and managing work in terms of ‘managing 
people’:
● Firstly, in a modern democratic society, is it realistic even to contemplate the possibility of 
managing people and that there are people willing to be managed?
● Secondly, can it be argued that a manager has no moral right to direct, manage or boss any 
individual?
● Thirdly, does the focus on people management tend to blur the part played by structures, 
systems, cultures, processes and the rest?26
Good people management
Whatever the veracity of these problems or the importance attached to the management of sys-
tems, the organising and management of work depends ultimately on the people who make up 
the organisation. Without people, systems and procedures and indeed organisations themselves 
are meaningless. And people need to be managed. But, of course, of increasing importance are:
● how the process of management is actually carried out;
● the style of managerial behaviour; and
● its effectiveness for both organisational performance and the satisfaction of its members.
With the general movement towards flatter organisation structures, flexible working and 
greater employee empowerment, there is more emphasis on an integrating rather than a tradi-
tional controlling style of management. Management style and behaviour can be as important 
as management competence.
Style and context
Mintzberg draws attention to the relationship between managerial style and the importance 
of context, and questions how much personal style has an influence on what managers do. 
People do not usually find themselves in managerial jobs by chance to shape as they wish. 
What you do as a manager is mostly determined by what you face as a manager.
Personal style is important, no question. But that seems to be more about how managers do 
things, including the decisions they make and the strategies they shape, than what they do as 
managers. In this regard, the literature, practitioner and academic alike, may be vastly over-
rating the importance of personal style. Style matters and context matters, but mostly they 
matter together, in a symbiotic relationship.27
Theory X and Theory Y management
The way in which managers approach the performance of their jobs and the behaviour they 
display towards subordinate staff are likely to be conditioned by underlying predispositions 
about people, and human nature and work. Drawing on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs model 
(discussed in Chapter  7), McGregor, in 1960, put forward two suppositions about human 
nature and behaviour at work. He argued that the style of management adopted is a func-
tion of the manager’s attitudes towards people and assumptions about human nature and 
behaviour. The two suppositions are called Theory X and Theory Y and are based on polar 
assumptions about people and work.28

368
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
Theory X assumptions
Theory X represents the carrot-and-stick assumptions on which traditional organisations are 
based. Its assumptions are that:
● the average person is lazy and has an inherent dislike of work;
● most people must be coerced, controlled, directed and threatened with punishment if the 
organisation is to achieve its objectives;
● the average person avoids responsibility, prefers to be directed, lacks ambition and values 
security most of all; and
● motivation occurs only at the physiological and security levels.
The central principle of Theory X is direction and control through a centralised system of 
organisation and the exercise of authority. McGregor questioned whether the Theory X 
approach to human nature is correct and the relevance of management practices that are based 
upon it. Assumptions based on a Theory X approach, and the traditional use of rewards and 
sanctions exercised by the nature of the manager’s position and authority, are likely to result 
in an exploitative or authoritarian style of management.
Theory Y assumptions
At the other extreme to Theory X is Theory Y, which represents the assumptions consistent 
with current research knowledge. The central principle of Theory Y is the integration of indi-
vidual and organisational goals. Its assumptions are:
● for most people, work is as natural as play or rest;
● people will exercise self-direction and self-control in the service of objectives to which they 
are committed;
● commitment to objectives is a function of rewards associated with their achievement;
● given the right conditions, the average worker can learn to accept and to seek responsibility;
● the capacity for creativity in solving organisational problems is distributed widely in the 
population;
● the intellectual potential of the average person is only partially utilised; and
● motivation occurs at the affiliation, esteem and self-actualisation levels as well as at the 
physiological and security levels.
The Theory Y approach is not a ‘soft’ option. In practice it is often difficult to achieve suc-
cessfully. It can be frustrating and time consuming, and mistakes will occur. For example, as 
Townsend reports:
Since 1952 I’ve been stumbling around buildings and running primitive Theory Y depart-
ments, divisions, and finally one whole Theory Y company: Avis. In 1962, after thirteen years, 
Avis had never made a profit (except one year when they jiggled their depreciation rates). 
Three years later the company had grown internationally (not by acquisitions) from $30 mil-
lion in sales to $75 million in sales, and had made successive annual profits of $1 million, $3 
million, and $5 million. If I had anything to do with this, I ascribe it all to my application of 
Theory Y. And a faltering, stumbling, groping, mistake-ridden application it was.29
Demands of the situation
The two views of Theory X and Theory Y tend to represent extremes of the natural inclination 
of managers towards a particular style of behaviour. In practice, however, the actual style of man-
agement behaviour adopted will be influenced by the demands of the situation.30 Where the job 
offers a high degree of intrinsic satisfaction or involves a variety of tasks, an element of problem-
solving and the exercise of initiative, or where output is difficult to measure in quantitative terms, 
then an informal, participative approach would seem to be more effective. In many cases this 
would apply to work of a scientific, technical or professional nature. Where commitment to the 
goals of the organisation is almost a prerequisite of membership, such as in certain voluntary or

 Critical review and refl ection 
 Although published in 1960, the underlying concepts of mcgregor’s theory X and theory Y are still some of the most 
significant and meaningful insights into our understanding of managerial behaviour. 
 What do YOU think? What experiences have YOU had of Theory X or Y management? What would be YOUR pre-
ferred natural style of managerial behaviour, and why? 
charity organisations, for example, then a Theory Y approach would clearly seem to be most 
appropriate. 
 However, even if a manager has a basic belief in Theory Y assumptions, there may be occa-
sions when it is necessary, or more appropriate, to adopt a Theory X approach. This approach 
may be indicated in emergency situations, or where shortage of time or other overriding fac-
tors demand the use of authority in directing actions to the tasks in hand. For example, in the 
hustle, heat and noise of a busy hotel kitchen preparing fresh meals for a large banquet, with 
many tasks to be co-ordinated over very short time scales, it seems to be recognised that a 
Theory X style of management is most appropriate. In such circumstances this style of man-
agement appears often to be accepted by the kitchen staff .  
 The Managerial/Leadership Grid ® 
 One means of describing and evaluating diff erent styles of management is the  Blake and 
Mouton  Managerial Grid® ( see  Figure  10.7 ). First published as the Managerial Grid in 1964, 
restated in 1978 and 1985 31 and republished in 1991 as the  Leadership Grid® , 32 the Grid pro-
vides a basis for comparison of managerial styles in terms of two principal dimensions: con-
cern for production and concern for people. 
 ●  Concern for production is the amount of emphasis that the manager places on accomplish-
ing the tasks in hand, achieving a high level of production and getting results or profi ts. 
This is represented along the horizontal axis of the Grid. 
 ●  Concern for people is the amount of emphasis that the manager gives to subordinates and 
colleagues as individuals and to their needs and expectations. This is represented along the 
vertical axis of the Grid. 
 Five basic combinations 
 The four corners and the centre of the Grid provide fi ve basic combinations of degree of con-
cern for production coupled with degree of concern for people ( see  Figure  10.7a ): 
  1.  Managers with a 1,1 rating, the impoverished manager, tend to be remote from their sub-
ordinates and believe in the minimum movement from their present position. 
  2.  Managers with a 9,1 rating, the authority–compliance manager, are autocratic. They tend 
to rely on a centralised system and the use of authority. 
  3.  The 1,9 rating managers, country club managers, believe that a contented staff  will under-
take what is required of them and achieve a reasonable level of output. 
  4.  The 5,5 rating, middle-of-the-road managers, have the approach of ‘live and let live’ and a 
tendency to avoid the real issues. 
  5.  Managers with a 9,9 rating, the team manager, believe in the integrating of task needs and 
concern for people. 
 These fi ve styles of management represent the extremes of the Grid. With a 9-point scale on each 
axis there is a total of 81 diff erent ‘mixtures’ of concern for production and concern for people. 
Most people would come up with a score somewhere in an intermediary position on the Grid.

371
Two additional grid styles
The 1991 edition of the Grid covers two additional styles, opportunism and 9 + 9 paternalism/
maternalism, which take account of the reaction of subordinates. In opportunistic manage-
ment, organisational performance occurs according to a system of exchanges, whereby effort 
is given only for an equivalent measure of the same. People adapt to the situation to gain maxi-
mum advantage of it (see Figure 10.7b).
In 9 + 9 paternalistic/maternalistic management, reward and approval are granted to people 
in return for loyalty and obedience, and punishment is threatened for failure to comply (see 
Figure 10.7c).
A summary of the seven basic combinations of the Grid is given in Table 10.1.
9,1 Authority–compliance management
Managers in this position have great concern for production and little 
concern for people. People are seen as ‘tools’ for production. They 
demand tight, unilateral control in order to complete tasks efficiently. 
They consider creativity and human relations to be unnecessary
1,9 Country club management
Managers in this position have great concern for people and little concern 
for production. They try to avoid conflicts and concentrate on being liked, 
even at the expense of production. To them the task is less important than 
good interpersonal relations. Their goal is to keep people happy. (This is a 
soft Theory X and not a sound human relations approach)
1,1 Impoverished management
This style is often referred to as laissez-faire. Leaders in this position have 
little concern for people or productivity. They avoid taking sides and stay 
out of conflicts. They do just enough to maintain group membership
5,5 Middle-of-the-road management
Leaders in this position have medium concern for both people and 
production. They rely on tried and true techniques and avoid taking 
untested risks. They attempt to balance their concern for both people and 
production, but are not committed strongly to either. Conflict is dealt with 
by avoiding extremes and seeking compromise rather than sound resolution
9 + 9 Paternalistic ‘father knows best’ 
management
This leader takes the high 9 level of concern from 9,1 and 1,9 to create 
a combined style of controlling paternalism. The paternalist strives for 
high results (high 9 from 9,1) and uses reward and punishment to gain 
compliance (high 9 from 1,9). The paternalist uses a high level of concern 
for people to reward for compliance or punish for rejection
Opportunistic ‘what’s in it for me?’ 
management
The opportunists use whatever Grid style is needed to obtain selfish 
interest and self-promotion. They adapt to situations to gain the 
maximum advantage. They may use 9,1 to push their own goals with one 
person, and 1,9 to gain trust and confidence with another. Performance 
occurs according to a system of exchanges. Effort is given only for an 
equivalent measure of the same
9,9 Team management
These managers demonstrate high concern for both people and 
production. They work to motivate employees to reach their highest 
levels of accomplishment. They explore alternatives openly and 
aggressively. They are flexible and responsive to change. This style is 
considered ideal

 Relevance today 
 According to  Newborough, ‘an organisation’s structure, plan and concept are crucial to 
its eff ectiveness. Yet beyond these, the most signifi cant single factor is the behaviour of the 
management team. Its members must act as leaders. They must accomplish their objectives 
through their ability to guide, motivate and integrate the eff orts of others’. The ultimate pur-
pose of studies of managerial style is to aid in the training and development of those who 
wish to become better leaders. Grid organisation development identifi es and applies relevant 
aspects of behavioural science, and Newborough maintains that the Grid is as relevant today 
as when it was fi rst launched. 33 And according to  Crainer and Dearlove, ‘Crude as it is, the 
Grid helps people who are not conversant with psychology to see themselves and those they 
work with more clearly, to understand their interactions, and identify the sources of resistance 
and confl icts.’ 34  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Whatever the talk about a more consultative style of managerial behaviour, the main complaint from disgruntled 
members of staff is usually about lack of clear direction and strong decisive management. 
 To what extent would YOU challenge this contention? What has been YOUR personal experience? How does this 
relate to YOUR own views on managerial behaviour? 
 Management systems 
 Work by McGregor, and by Blake and Mouton, suggests that an organisation is more likely 
to harness its staffi  ng resources eff ectively if there is a participative style of management. This 
view is supported by the work of  Likert, writing in the 1960s and 1970s. On the basis of a 
questionnaire to managers in over 200 organisations and research into the performance char-
acteristics of diff erent types of organisations, Likert identifi es a fourfold model of manage-
ment systems. 35 These systems are designated by number: 
 ●   System 1 – Exploitive authoritative. Decisions are imposed on subordinates, motivation is 
based on threats, there is very little teamwork or communication; responsibility is centred 
at the top of the organisational hierarchy. 
 ●  System 2 – Benevolent authoritative. A condescending form of leadership, motivation is 
based on a system of rewards, there is only limited teamwork or communication; responsi-
bility is at managerial levels but not at lower levels of the organisational hierarchy. 
 ●   System 3 – Consultative. Leadership involves some trust in subordinates, motivation is 
based on rewards but also some involvement, there is a fair degree of teamwork, and com-
munication takes place vertically and horizontally; responsibility for achieving the goals of 
the organisation is spread more widely throughout the hierarchy. 
 ●  System 4 – Participative. Leadership involves trust and confi dence in subordinates, moti-
vation is based on rewards for achievement of agreed goals, there is participation and a 
high degree of teamwork and communication; responsibility for achieving the goals of the 
organisation is widespread throughout all levels of the hierarchy. 
 Supportive relationships 
 The nearer the behavioural characteristics of an organisation approach System 4, the more 
likely this will lead to long-term improvement in staff  turnover and high productivity, low 
scrap, low costs and high earnings. Likert sets out three fundamental concepts of System 4 
management. These are the use of: 

Chapter 10  Understanding management
373
● the principle of supportive relationships among members of the organisation and in par-
ticular between superior and subordinate;
● group decision-making and group methods of organisation and supervision; and high-per-
formance aspirations for all members of the organisation.
In considering high-performance aspirations, Likert refers to studies that suggest that employees 
generally want stable employment and job security, opportunities for promotion and satisfac-
tory compensation. They want, also, to feel proud of their organisation and its performance and 
accomplishments. In System 4 management, superiors should therefore have high-performance 
aspirations, but so also should every member of the organisation. To be effective, these high-
performance goals should not be imposed but set by a participative mechanism involving group 
decision-making and a multiple overlapping group structure. The mechanism should enable 
employees to be involved in setting high-performance goals that help to satisfy their needs.
Managing with and through people
Although there are many aspects to management, one essential ingredient of any successful 
manager is the ability to handle people effectively. Recall, for example, the previous discus-
sion (Chapter 1) on people and organisational behaviour. A genuine concern for people and 
for their welfare goes a long way in encouraging them to perform well. A positive policy of 
investment in people and an interpersonal relationship approach to management are, in the 
longer term, worth the effort. For example, the UK government-sponsored initiative Investors 
in People is based on a commitment to the benefits that organisations can gain through their 
people and on the vital role of managers.
It is possible to put forward a number of underlying philosophies that arguably are likely to 
make for the successful management of people, and lead to both improved work performance 
and more contented staff (see Figure 10.8). These philosophies are not intended to be prescrip-
tive but to encourage discussion on the extent to which you agree with the points of view.
Figure 10.8  The effective management of people

374
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
Consideration, respect and trust
People generally respond according to the way they are treated. If you give a little, you will 
invariably get a lot back. Make people feel important and give them a sense of personal worth. 
The majority of staff will respond constructively if treated with consideration and respect, 
and as responsible individuals who wish to serve the organisation well.
However, how can members of staff show that they can be trusted unless trust is first placed 
in them? The initiative must come from management: ‘Lack of trust is probably one of the 
greatest time and resource wasters in the workplace. Managers who do not trust their employ-
ees are probably wasting hours every week checking up on them at every turn and failing to 
utilise the resources at their disposal.’36
Research from the CIPD shows that employee attitudes to senior management across the 
public sector are generally more negative than their private-sector counterparts. Public-sector 
employees are less likely to feel they are treated with respect by senior managers, and they have 
less trust and confidence in them.37
Recognition and credit
People can be praised to success. Give genuine recognition and credit when it is due and 
let people know you appreciate them. Too often managers appear unresponsive to good 
performance, taking this for granted. But they are quick to criticise on the occasions when 
performance falls below expectations. It should not be assumed that staff would necessar-
ily take a lack of response as a sign of positive recognition rather than just the absence of 
criticism. So often you hear the comment ‘Well nobody has complained so I suppose every-
thing is all right.’ What a poor indictment of management style! Positive feedback on good 
performance is a strong motivator and staff are then more likely to accept and respond to 
constructive criticism.
Involvement and availability
Involve yourself with the work of the staff and make sure you fully understand the difficul-
ties and distastes of their job. Ensure an open flow of communications and encourage par-
ticipation and feedback. Take an active interest in the work of staff but without excessive 
supervision or inhibiting their freedom of action. Wherever possible be available to staff as 
a priority, rather than to administration. Remember the importance of giving time to lis-
ten genuinely to the feelings and problems of staff. This means giving staff your full atten-
tion including adopting appropriate body language (recall the discussion in Chapter 6). The 
approach of ‘Management By Walking About’ (MBWA), together with effective communi-
cation processes, is often heralded as a positive management practice. However, there is the 
danger of arousing mistrust among staff, the suspicion of management snooping and doubts 
about ‘what are you doing here?’. MBWA is not just wandering aimlessly. It is unlikely to be 
effective unless perceived by staff as part of a genuine belief by management in the continu-
ing importance of keeping staff informed and giving time to listen to, and understand, their 
feelings and problems.
Fair and equitable treatment
Treat people fairly but according to merit. Ensure justice in treatment, equitable systems of 
motivation and rewards, clear HR policies and procedures, avoidance of discrimination and 
full observance of all laws and codes of conduct relating to employment. People expect certain 
outcomes in exchange for certain contributions or inputs. A feeling of inequality causes ten-
sion and motivates the person to indulge in certain forms of behaviour in order to remove or to 
reduce the perceived inequity.38 Recall the discussion on the psychological contract (Chapter 1) 
and equity theory of motivation (Chapter 7).

Chapter 10 UnderstAnding mAnAgement
375
 Positive action on an individual basis 
 Deal with individual situations on an individual basis and avoid the ‘blanket’ approach. For 
example, it has come to a manager’s attention that a couple of members of staff  have failed to 
provide some urgently requested information on time. The manager’s reaction is to send a cir-
cular email to  all members of the department reminding them of the need for, and importance 
of, meeting deadlines. This may appear to be an easy way out to the manager. But what are the 
likely reactions of staff ? The two members concerned might shield behind the generality of the 
email and persuade themselves that it does not apply particularly to them. They might even 
choose to believe that the manager must be referring to other members of staff , perhaps in a 
diff erent section, and take little notice of the circular. In contrast, the majority of staff  in the 
department who do have a good record of providing requested information on time may well 
be annoyed or upset by the circular. 
 There could be staff  who, despite pressing diffi  culties, have taken great pride in their work 
and made a special eff ort to maintain an excellent record of co-operation – quite possibly 
without any previous positive recognition from management.  It would be understandable if 
the reaction of these staff  was one of resentment and disillusionment, and with a possible 
adverse eff ect on their future attitude to work. 
 Emphasis on end results 
 Place emphasis on end results and levels of actual performance and achievement rather than 
on compliance with detailed instructions, rules or regulations. Where set attendance times 
are  clearly seen as a necessary requirement of the job, it is right that managers should ensure 
that timekeeping is adhered to and enforced as appropriate. But in many cases rigid times of 
attendance are not an essential requirement for eff ective performance. The increasing move-
ment to work/life balance, fl exible working patterns and teleworking coupled with demands to 
boost productivity are placing growing emphasis on what staff  actually achieve rather than the 
time spent at work. The important criteria are the level and quality of performance. 
 Staﬀ  and customer satisfaction 
 The starting point for customer, or consumer, satisfaction is good manager–subordinate rela-
tionships. Supportive and harmonious working relationships are more likely to create a work-
ing environment that results in high levels of both staff   and consumer satisfaction. Managers 
need to adopt a positive attitude towards staff  and to develop a spirit of mutual co-operation. 
Staff  should feel that they are working  with the manager rather than  for the manager.  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the idea of basic philosophies such as managing by consideration, respect and trust may seem enlightened but is 
naive and idealistic. given the natural scepticism of staff, such philosophies are difficult to implement in practice and 
subject to abuse. 
 What are YOUR views? To what extent would YOU feel confident in managing by respect and trust? 
 A looser approach to management 
 It is not suggested that managers should give up the right to manage: it is a question of  how 
they manage and how they use their authority. For example, a Theory X style with emphasis 
on direction and control, and the use of rewards and sanctions exercised by nature of the 
manager’s position and authority; or a Theory Y style in which individuals may satisfy their 
motivational needs through integration with meeting the goals of the organisation. 

376
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
Management may also be based on ‘organisational power’ derived from status or position 
within the hierarchical structure, and the use of formal authority; or ‘personal power’ derived 
from competence and expertise, identification with subordinates, commanding respect, and 
urging and encouraging people in the performance of their tasks.39
Thomas suggests the need for a loose approach to business, in which tight controls are 
replaced with a more relaxed management style. As a result of employee and customer expecta-
tions, and social and technological change, the modern workforce expects to play a greater role 
in service delivery and not be hampered by strict rules and inflexible regulations: ‘For a business 
to survive in these changing times, it needs to adopt a far looser approach in which specific rules 
are replaced with broad business principles . . . You have to build a culture of trust where people 
want to behave in a way that is best for the organisation.’ However, Thomas believes the biggest 
obstacle is middle managers who fear they do not have authority to make big decisions and rely 
on management by the rule book, their process, templates and rigid structures.40
The importance of emotions and mood
We have mentioned previously that people are not homogeneous and human behaviour is 
capricious. People bring to work their own perceptions, feelings and attitudes. The importance 
of human foibles and emotions should not be forgotten. Robbins, for example, points out that 
employees bring an emotional component with them to work every day.
Emotions are part of our lives. That is, we not only think, we feel! But the field of manage-
ment has been guilty for a long time of treating employees as if they’re nonemotional. All 
work behavior is assumed to be fully rational. While this makes for simpler analysis of work-
place behavior, it also creates highly unrealistic and inaccurate assessments.41
Bolchover draws attention to the importance of mood as crucial to job performance in areas 
such as decision-making, creativity, teamwork, negotiation and leadership. Leaders’ moods 
are highly contagious and what makes moods even more potentially beneficial or destructive is 
their infectiousness. Bolchover suggests that this ‘emotional contagion’ lies at the root of what 
we call corporate morale. Managers must appreciate that their own attitudes are contagious, 
profoundly affecting those who work for them: ‘Pretty much everything that determines an 
employee’s fundamental attitude at work is under the control of the manager.’42
Guidance on good management
GOV.UK has produced a ‘Guidance to Good Management’ (published 27 October 2014).
Managers play a central role in any organisation. They connect people to the purpose of 
their work and help them understand why their work is important. They set tasks and track 
performance, and they recognise the contribution of each individual in achieving the organisa-
tion’s goals. They also play a leading role in helping their team to identify the areas they need 
to develop.
What makes a good manager?
What all inspirational managers have in common is they have taken the time to demonstrate 
one or more of the following positive behaviours that people look for in a good manager:
● they understand how to model leadership behaviours, inspire a shared vision and enable 
and support others to act;
● they champion learning and development for themselves and their teams and create an 
environment where the giving and receiving of feedback is the norm;
● they know and listen to their team and encourage open discussion and constructive 
challenge.

Chapter 10  Understanding management

As part of the Good Management campaign there is a Department of Business, Innovation 
and Skills (BIS) Manager’s Charter (see Figure 10.9).
The qualities of a manager and managerial effectiveness are also discussed later (see 
Chapter 16).
The future of management
According to Owen, the death of modern management is nigh and the old world of simplistic 
formulae for strategy, finance and leadership no longer work. After the first wave of manage-
ment with tradition carefully handed down from master to apprentice, and the second wave of 
modern management following the Industrial Revolution, we are now embarking on the third 
wave of management. Organisations are moving from command and control to co-operation 
and commitment. To manage in an increasingly uncertain world risks must be turned into 
opportunity and challenges into success.
I am valued and recognised by BIS for the time and effort I put in to people management. 
BIS provides the tools and training I need and is intolerant of poor practice.
	
I take my responsibility as a line manager seriously.
●  I am generous with my time. Supporting my team is a priority.
●  I recognise that I am a role model. I lead by example.
●  I get the basics right. Appraisals are done well and on time.
	
I know the people I manage, their abilities, aspirations, frustrations and motivations. I 
am also self aware, and open about my own strengths and weaknesses.
	
I create a safe environment for open discussion and construtive challenge by:
●  Being visible and accessible
●  Openly inviting the views of others
●  Listening and acting
	
I give honest, timely, objective feedback.
●  I give recognition when people have done well.
●  I take prompt action to address under-performance.
	
I champion learning and development including for myself.
	
I work with my team to manage workloads, find smarter ways of working and clearly 
define our roles.
	
I delegate responsibilities not tasks. I coach more than I direct.
●  I understand the fine line between empowerment and abandonment.
	
I value diversity and promote equality. I show this by being inclusive and welcoming the 
contributions and views of all.
	
I am supported by staff who live the BIS values, take responsibility for their own 
development and give me feedback on how I am doing.

  The job of the manager is changing out of all recognition. Managers are still the glue that 
holds the organisation together. But it is no longer about connecting the top and bottom of 
the organisation. It is about connecting a network of power and infl uence to make things 
happen through other people. This requires a changed set of skills . . . The job is just not 
command and control. The job is about orchestrating the skills of the network, helping the 
organisation discover and deliver the best solution. The job has changed from instructing to 
enabling. This makes the manager’s job harder but more rewarding. 43 
 A manager-less workplace? 
 With the demise of the hierarchy and a future that is fl at,  Howes questions if managers can 
survive in the workplace. Austerity measures in the UK have resulted in public-sector organisa-
tions making several structural changes including a reduction in senior management. However, 
Howes points out that those making fl atter structural changes in the public or private sectors 
are smaller organisations with fewer employees. In a leadership environment one person domi-
nates naturally. The group must show willingness and consensual agreement to an unoffi  cial 
manager lurking within the group. 
  Leadership environments are a good starting point, but ultimately, someone will step up or 
things won’t get done. 44 
 But what is actually ‘new’? 
 There is much written today about changes in the workforce and new approaches to manage-
ment. It is interesting to note, however, the ideas on the nature of managerial behaviour put 
forward many years ago by eminent writers such as Mary Parker Follett and Peter Drucker. 
 Over seventy years ago,  Follett’s  thinking was based on concern for social, evolution-
ary progress, and the organisation and management of people for eff ective performance 
and a fuller life. Follett envisioned the successful operation of groups, and management 
responsibility diff used through the organisation and not just concentrated at the top of the 
hierarchy. 45  
 Drucker suggested that one of the essential principles of management is that it is about 
human beings. 
 Management is about human beings. Its task is to make people capable of joint perfor-
mance, to make their strengths eff ective and their weaknesses irrelevant. This is what 
organization is all about, and it is the reason that management is the critical, determining 
factor . . . We depend on management for our livelihoods and our ability to contribute 
and achieve. 46  
 The fact is that management ultimately depends on an understanding of human nature. I 
suggest it goes much further than that. In the fi rst place, good management depends on the 
acceptance of certain basic values. It cannot be achieved without honesty and integrity, or 
without consideration for the interests of others. Secondly, it is the understanding of human 
foibles that we all share, such as jealousy, envy, status, prejudice, perception, temperament, 
motivation and talent, which provides the greatest challenge to managers. 
 HRH The Duke of Edinburgh 47  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 A number of writers have drawn attention to the changing nature of management and the work of the manager. Yet 
reading the ideas of eminent writers such as mary Parker Follett (1942) and Peter drucker (1954) it appears little is 
really new, and the underlying role of management remains unchanged.

 Review and discussion questions 
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  management is fundamental to the eff ective operation of work organisations. it is essentially 
an integrating activity that permeates every facet of the organisation. 
  2  management is directed towards attainment of aims and objectives, within a structured organ-
isation and achieved through the eff orts of other people. 
  3  One approach to the process of management is attention to common activities and principles 
of management. these are not prescriptive but guidelines for action. 
  4  A popular way of describing the essential nature of managerial work is getting work done sec-
ond-hand and responsibility for the work and eff orts of other people. 
  5   there is debate about the extent to which there are general common features of management 
in both private-enterprise and public-sector organisations. 
  6  the jobs of individual managers diff er widely and are infl uenced by a number of factors. there 
are a number of signifi cant empirical studies into the work of a manager. 
  7  the way in which managers carry out their responsibilities is important. increasing attention is 
given to managerial style and the ability to handle people successfully. 
  8   managerial behaviour is likely to be infl uenced by attitudes towards people and assumptions 
about human nature and behaviour at work – called theory X and theory Y. 
  9   As a basis for discussion, it is possible to suggest a number of underlying philosophies that 
arguably make for success in managing with and through people. 
  10   much is written today about changes in the workplace and the future of management. How-
ever, one can reasonably question how much is actually new.

 Objectives 
 Completing this exercise should help you to enhance the following skills: 
 ●  Act in the role of the manager to handle a number of real-life situations. 
 ●  Conduct management–staﬀ  interviews and discussions. 
 ●  Review critically your ability to deal with emotionally diﬃ  cult situations. 
 Exercise 
 Given below are a number of real-life situations. You are required to: 
  a.  Think through each one and explain how you as the manager might best handle the discussion with your mem-
ber of staﬀ . 
  b.  Record how you would approach each discussion/interview. 
  c.  Consider what speciﬁ c questions might you be likely to ask, and why? 
  d.  Share and compare your responses with colleagues in a small-group situation. 
 Situation 1 
 One of your employees, who is hard-working and conscientious with tasks, continually arrives late for work. 
This is the sixth time this has happened. The person’s excuse is that they have to take their child to nursery 
because they are getting divorced and their spouse refuses to do this task. 
 Situation 2 
 You receive a complaint from one of your female employees who claims to have accidently found a porno-
graphic image on the PC of another employee and ﬁ nds this oﬀ ensive. 
 Situation 3 
 One of your permanent employees has been accused of assaulting another member of staﬀ  who works in the 
same organisation but as an independent contractor.

 Situation 4 
 You overhear a member of your department comment of you that ‘he/she has no idea of the technical com-
plexity of my work . . . i don’t know how he/she can manage a department like this!’ 
 Situation 5 
 A key client calls you to complain about sarcastic and impatient comments made by one of your more expe-
rienced technicians. Comments like ‘Your people must be really thick if they think that’s how it works’ have 
proved less than helpful. You know this person has been working long hours, achieving excellent results and 
is clearly committed to their job and the department. in fact, you have recently promoted the technician for 
these very reasons. 
 Situation 6 
 in a recent management meeting, a relatively new colleague repeatedly contradicted you and appeared to be 
‘scoring points’ at your expense. Although the colleague had made some valid, even perceptive comments, it 
is not exactly helping your relationship get off  to an encouraging start. Furthermore, this has happened on a 
previous occasion. 
 Discussion with colleagues 
 ●  How would you summarise the essential nature of the manager–subordinate relationship? 
 ●  Using your own examples, explain the importance of using appropriate approaches when dealing with potentially 
diffi  cult situations.  
 ●  What have you learned about your potential skills of eff ective people management? 
 is happiness an important component of a well-man-
aged organisation? it might seem intuitively correct to 
believe that people work better when they are relaxed 
and enjoying their work, and much research has gone 
into the examination of the links between job satisfac-
tion, work motivation and overall organisational effi  -
ciency as demonstrated earlier  ( Chapter  7 ).  But does 
human happiness per se (as separate from the enjoy-
ment of the work itself) make any diff erence to per-
formance? experimental data reported by a team of 
researchers at Warwick University seem to suggest that 
it does. 48 
 the experiments were similar to those described 
in the earlier case study on behavioural  economics 
 ( Chapter  6 ). the ‘work’ was a simple but uninter-
esting mathematical task designed to simulate a 
piece-rate ‘white-collar’ (non-managerial) type of 
job. the ‘work’ could be evaluated for both quan-
tity (how many calculations were performed during 
a specified time) and quality (how many of them 
were correct) and participants were paid according 
to output. 
 Individuals are asked to add sequences of five 2-digit 
numbers under timed conditions. This task is simple but is 
taxing under pressure. We think of it as representing – in a 
stylized way – an iconic white-collar job: both intellectual 
ability and effort are rewarded. 49  
 Participants’ mathematical ability was tested and 
matched, and payment was off ered according to the 
number of correct results achieved in the timed sessions, 
which happened over several weeks. the experimental 
groups were shown a short series of popular comedy 
sketches before attempting the task. At the end of every 
session, all groups were asked to complete a question-
naire to gauge both their general levels of happiness and 
(importantly) any increase in happiness experienced by 
members of the control group after watching the fi lm. 
the result? A consistent and signifi cant rise in productiv-
ity – up 12 per cent – for the experimental groups com-
pared with the control groups. As the authors conclude: 
 if well-being boosts human performance, that 
raises the possibility of self-reinforcing spirals from 
productivity-to-well-being-to-productivity. 50

Bad apples
Contrast this with work done back in 2006 that exam-
ines an opposing effect: the influence of negativity 
displayed by a member on group performance.51 The 
so-called ‘bad apples’ who spoil the whole barrel were 
defined as exhibiting behaviours such as withhold-
ing of effort, being affectively negative and violating 
important interpersonal norms, but not behaving in 
an illegal way or such as would incur disciplinary sanc-
tions. It was noted that consistent negative behav-
iour by even one member had a disproportionately 
severe negative impact on overall group performance. 
In other words, ‘unhappy’ members could have a 
depressing effect on colleagues’ output by causing 
them to withdraw, react against the negativity or to 
seek distractions.
Almost all of us have either had the personal 
experience of working with someone who displayed 
bad apple behaviours . . . When this process starts 
to unfold at work, it consumes inordinate amounts of 
time, psychological resources, and emotional energy.52
It would seem, therefore, that general workplace happi-
ness – quite distinctly from job satisfaction – is valuable, 
and unhappiness can be damaging or lead to ‘emotional 
contagion’. So what are the implications for manage-
ment? One example of a company that seems to take 
the happiness of its workforce very seriously is media 
company UKRD.
Open, honest, fun, fair, professional and 
unconventional
UKRD owns and operates seventeen commercial radio 
stations throughout the UK, from Pirate FM in Corn-
wall to Star Radio in County Durham. It was awarded 
top place in the Sunday Times 100 Best Companies 
to Work For53 in 2011 for the first time, and in 2014 it 
received the same accolade for the fourth year in a row. 
The award is based on the views of employees – and 
in 2014 the Chief Executive Officer William Rogers was 
also named Best Leader in the survey’s mid-sized com-
pany category – for the third time. In a press release, the 
Company Chairman explained that:
William epitomises the approach to management 
that we have at all levels in the company and his 
recognition in the Sunday Times in this way highlights 
the quality, not only of his leadership, but of the whole 
UKRD leadership team.54
Rogers, who became CEO of the organisation in 
2002, has focused his management team’s style around 
six core values:
● Open – Being open-minded to new ways of think-
ing, being open to criticism constructively delivered 
from wheresoever it may come and the welcoming 
of new ideas and opportunities. A requirement not 
just to hear, but to listen.
● Honest – The reflection of views and opinions 
delivered in a considered but clear and frank way. 
Expressing your real opinion, upward or downward, 
and an obligation to deal ethically and with integrity 
with colleagues and customers.
● Fair – A requirement to consider fairness in the 
broadest sense of the word. Fairness to the business, 
to colleagues, to customers and, on occasion, to all 
in balance. What appears to be fair at first sight may 
be less fair after due consideration.
● Fun – Enjoy work. Whether it be spontaneous or 
organised, delivering an environment in which a 
smile hits the faces of you and your colleagues on a 
regular basis is the responsibility of all.
● Professional – The highest standards of commit-
ment and delivery across all areas of responsibility 
for which an individual, at any level, may have. 
William Rogers, CEO of UKRD

384
Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
Delivering on commitments, honouring obligations 
and respecting those things that make a difference 
to the reputation of the company and those that 
work for it.
● Unconventional – Be different, try different things 
and challenge the norm. It may be ‘done that way’, 
but should it be? Innovate, take risks and be pre-
pared to fail.55
He explains that the values are intended to have a direct 
effect on the way staff behave towards each other, even 
to change employees’ lives for the better; he believes 
that if people are happy at work then they are generally 
happy in life too. In the Sunday Times survey, 94 per cent 
of the workforce reported that they loved their jobs, 
and the company was ranked particularly highly for giv-
ing employees a sense of well-being as well as offering 
opportunities for personal growth. Rogers sees both of 
these qualities as being vital to unlock the ‘discretionary 
dividend’ of individual performance that makes a big 
difference to the bottom line.
Spread a little happiness
His personal style of management, and that which he 
insists on for the whole management team, is about 
approachability and openness. He does not have a 
personal assistant to gate-keep his diary and allocate 
his time, and he spends most of his working week out 
and about visiting the stations. He makes sure he speaks 
directly to everyone on the team, and takes time to say 
a proper farewell:
If I or any of our senior team are visiting one of the 17 
stations that we have around the country – and the 
meeting is scheduled to go from 10am until 12.30pm, 
we don’t put a 12.30 departure in our diary: it’s 12.45 
so we build in time to say goodbye to everyone before 
we leave.56
Rogers also recognises that living the core values, espe-
cially for managers, can be a challenge:
People have left our business because they didn’t 
get it  .  .  .  Two senior managers were removed 
from our organisation because they couldn’t deliver 
management in a style that reflected those values. 
Great sales people have been removed or have left 
because they couldn’t operate within those values.57
Nevertheless, management commitment to the values 
is crucial, and recognised as one of the company’s key 
strengths by the Sunday Times adjudicators:
‘The reason the vision and values work is because 
they’re demonstrated from the top,’ says Eagle’s 
managing director Paul Marcus. ‘[Rogers is] a fabulous 
person to work for, a joy.’ Staff agree: they have a great 
deal of faith in him (95%, first), and find him inspiring 
(94%, also first).58
Of course, any organisation could be a nice place to work 
without actually being efficient. However, if one of the 
key indicators of organisational performance is return on 
investment for shareholders, UKRD seems to be on the 
button. In the summer of 2014 it announced two divi-
dend payments to shareholders based on strong growth 
and increased revenue across the group. Commenting on 
the company’s performance, Rogers himself made it clear 
that the true drivers of the business and its profitability, 
even in difficult times, were the local staff and managers.
The local focus is truly paying off and we are seeing the 
clearest evidence yet that when you deliver truly local 
radio to an audience that is keen to be served by the 
kind of committed teams we have in all our stations, 
the results feed through.59
So maybe real life bears out the findings of the War-
wick research team: there is indeed a lot to be said for 
spreading a little happiness at work.
 Tasks
	 1	 What sort of management style does William Rogers exhibit? Base your answer on one of the models in the 
first part of the chapter. What risks might be associated with this style?
	 2	 Compare and contrast the six core values of UKRD with the eight basic managerial philosophies (see 
Figure 10.8). How far do they overlap, and where do they differ?
	 3	 If, as the evidence suggests, happiness can improve performance, what are the implications for a manager’s 
or team leader’s own behaviour towards his or her staff?
	 4	 Consider the concept of ‘emotional contagion’ described in the chapter and the case. What steps could a 
manager take to improve a situation where negativity of a member is harming the team’s effectiveness?

Academic viewpoint
Below you will find the title and abstract of a recent article in an academic journal that explores a topic relevant to 
the chapters in Part 3.
Marinova, S., Van Dyne, L. and Moon, H. ‘Are Good Citizens Good Transformational Leaders as Well? An 
Employee-Centric Perspective on Transformational Leadership’, Group & Organization Management, vol. 40, no. 
1, 2015, pp. 62–87. doi: 10.1177/1059601114561257
Abstract
Research has demonstrated robust positive relationships between transformational leadership and employee atti-
tudes and behaviors. To date, the preponderance of the literature has been leader-centric and focused on individu-
als who are already in leader roles. In this article, we adopt an employee-centric perspective and focus on behaviors 
of professionals who are not in formal leader roles. Specifically, we apply evolutionary theory as a theoretical lens 
for proposing that those who perform organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) will be seen as transformational 
leaders. We hypothesize linkages between four types of OCBs and four dimensions of transformational leadership. 
Multi-source field sample results based on more than 1,000 participants provide general support for the predictions. 
We discuss theoretical and practical implications.
Commentary
The authors have researched their hypothesis that not 
all people who show leadership are in formal leader or 
management roles within organisations. In professional 
organisations where people often put in a lot of ‘discre-
tionary effort’ (going to great lengths to get jobs done) it 
seems possible that those who behave in the same way 
as transformational leaders can affect their colleagues in 
ways that encourage them to be loyal and put in extra 
effort on behalf of the organisation (organisational 
citizenship behaviours or OCBs). Individuals who seem 
to put the good of the organisation above their own 
personal interests are often well regarded by their col-
leagues and become role models. They indicate four 
ways in which OCB can be demonstrated (being a 
‘change agent’ who tries to improve things, being a ‘good 
Samaritan’ who takes care of people, being a ‘good sol-
dier’ who ensures things go to plan, and being a ‘good 
sportsman’ who acts as a stabilizing influence when 
there is conflict) and the circumstances under which

Part 3 Case study
The Eden Project
If a single word can be used to sum up the achievements 
of Tim Smit, that word might be ‘regeneration’. To turn 
one derelict, neglected corner of southwest England 
into a successful tourist business attracting millions of 
visitors is a remarkable achievement, but to do it twice 
is simply astonishing. Yet this is precisely what Smit has 
done, and in the Eden Project we can see the nature of 
this achievement through a blend of visionary and inno-
vative leadership combined with a strong sense of the 
value of teamwork.
Before Eden
Cornwall is one of several parts of the UK that suffered 
economic decline during the later twentieth century. Its 
industrial heritage has all but disappeared in the wake 
of globalisation and the shifting nature of the industrial 
world landscape. The last tin mine closed in 1998, and 
the ruined mine towers are witness to what was once 
the largest tin mining industry in the world. The produc-
tion of china clay remains one of Cornwall’s oldest cur-
rent industries, but that too is in decline and a European 
Union report of 2014 noted that Cornwall was possibly 
the poorest region in the UK.1 The fishing business is 
contracting, and traditional agricultural and horticul-
tural production, mainly vegetables and flower bulbs, 
is being challenged by similar, year-round levels of pro-
duction in developing countries. Cornwall as a county 
has, for some years, been in receipt of European Union 
Objective One funding destined to assist with economic 
regeneration in Europe’s poorest regions. This level of 
relative poverty is probably something that many of 
the tourists who visit Cornwall’s beautiful landscapes, 
historic properties and wild coastland do not gener-
ally see; indeed tourism has become one of the ­largest 
single income-generating business sectors in the area. 
While there are some strong indications that the Cor-
nish economy might be revitalised by the arrival of new, 
knowledge-based industries that are supported by tech-
nological developments, tourism remains at the heart of 
the county’s economy.2
In 1990, in a project that would contribute substan-
tially to Cornwall’s reputation as a tourist destination, 
John Willis, Tim Smit and John Nelson began to restore 
the long-derelict gardens surrounding the stately home 
and seat of the Tremayne family at Heligan, near Meva-
gissey. The story of this garden, its dereliction after the 
start of the Great War of 1914, its rediscovery following

each type of OCB is effective. They conclude that 
organisations could benefit from this understanding to 
develop training programmes to encourage transforma-
tional leadership and thereby increased organisational 
effectiveness.
The article might prompt you to consider some 
of the following questions
● To what extent does your own experience, either at 
work or in a social or sporting context, bear out the 
hypothesis that not all those who show leadership 
are in formal leader roles?
● Do you think it is better for organisations to identify 
and promote individuals who encourage OCBs or to 
leave them in non-leadership roles, and why?
● To what extent might managers feel threatened by 
informal types of transformational leadership in their 
team?
● Does the nature and structure of an organisation 
affect the likely emergence of transformational lead-
ers who are not formal leaders? Would you expect to 
find similar results in different types of organisations 
such as manufacturing plants, large retail businesses 
or service organisations?

a storm in 1990 and its restoration, in part as a memo-
rial to the gardeners who would have died in the war, is 
one of enormous poignancy and beauty.3 For Smit, an 
archaeology and anthropology graduate who had also 
developed a love of gardens, it was a project that ena-
bled him to use many of his professional skills, and the 
garden itself has become one of England’s most loved,4 
and a major attraction for Cornwall.
However, while Heligan is horticultural archaeology, 
and the gardens today are, in essence, a living museum 
of nineteenth-century estate gardening, the Eden Pro-
ject was a very different type of restoration, and one 
that drew upon Smit’s additional skills as a rock music 
producer and showman. What Smit was restoring in his 
second major project was land, and the vision and pur-
pose behind the Eden Project looks to the future rather 
than the past.
Ten things to do with a disused clay pit. . . 
Photographs of what was to become the Eden Project 
prior to the arrival of Tim and his team reveal the extent 
of the transformation. In the mid-1990s the worked-out 
Bodelva china clay pit near St Austell looked very much 
like what many believed it to be: a derelict, polluted 
and worthless piece of land stripped of fertile soil –  
essentially a 34-acre puddle. The statistics behind its 
transformation into one of the most spectacular tourist 
attractions in the country are mind-boggling. The first 
task, in 1998 when the project began, was to landscape 
the site and shift 1.8 million tons of earth to reduce the 
pit-side gradients, a task that took twelve dumper trucks 
and eight bulldozers six months. During the first few 
months of work, it rained almost continuously, which 
resulted in 43 million gallons of water draining into the 
clay-lined pit.5 This was both a problem and an oppor-
tunity: the problem was to design a drainage system that 
would prevent the whole site turning into a soggy bog 
during the average English summer; but the opportunity 
was to demonstrate one of the founding principles of 
sustainability, and use the run-off water to service the 
site. The system designed to meet this purpose collects, 
on average, 22 litres a second, and about two-thirds of 
the water needed to run the project (including plant 
watering, a 22-metre waterfall in the tropical biome and 
the numerous toilets!) is ‘grey’ water, in other words that 
which can be harvested from the site itself. Over 85,000 
tonnes of soil, made from waste products and other 
organic material, were needed to turn the clay-lined 
puddle into the fertile ground in which over 1,000,000 
plants of more than 5,000 species could grow, to create 
a series of global gardens.
The two original ‘biomes’, spectacular greenhouses 
that recreate a humid tropical environment and warm 
temperate climate respectively, are perhaps what most 
visitors remember about the project, although more 
than half the site is actually open air. The Humid Trop-
ics biome is the largest conservatory in the world at 
240 metres by 100 metres by 55 metres high, enclos-
ing 15,590 square metres. It houses ‘the biggest jungle 
in captivity’ and contains plants native to the tropical 
areas of the world including Malaysia, West Africa and 
South America as well as islands like the Seychelles. The 
Warm Temperate biome covers 6,540 square metres, 
and replicates a Mediterranean climate housing plants 
that represent those that grow between 30°–40° north 
and south of the equator. The ‘Core’ is the project’s 
education centre, the roof of which is constructed 
on the same mathematical principle (the Fibonacci 
sequence of interwoven spirals) that appears in nature 
in many plant formations, and which is also the way 
in which some plants pack the maximum number of 
seeds, spines or leaves into the smallest possible area.6 
And since summer 2012 you can fly over the entire site 
on a 740-metre-long zipwire – if you have a head for 
heights!
If you build it, they will come
The Eden Project is a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
Eden Trust, a registered charity, and initially cost £120 
million to build. The money was raised from a variety of 
sources including grant funding, such as that from the 
UK government’s Millennium Project Fund. Together 
with commercial loans, the grant money is used for cap-
ital investment on the site and educational or conserva-
tion projects in other parts of the world. Revenue comes 
from both the commercial activities of the project and 
gifts or donations.7 The money is used to run the opera-
tion, maintain the asset base and service the commer-
cial loans; so although as a charity it does not make a 
profit, it does have to run at commercially successful 
levels. Visitors provide the major source of revenue, and 
Eden has regularly attracted over a million a year since 
it opened in 2001 – although the recession combined 
with a very wet year saw them drop below that number 
for the first time during 2012–13. Nevertheless, Eden 
won the British Travel Awards accolade as Best UK Lei-
sure Attraction for the third year running in November 
2013.8 So what exactly do people come to see?
Tim Smit’s vision for Eden is far from being that of 
just another garden. He is, as we have noted, not a hor-
ticulturalist, but an archaeologist, anthropologist and 
former rock-show organiser. The purpose of Eden is

389
essentially to educate people about the environment 
and the human relationship with the plant world, but 
to do so in such a way as to set a conservation and 
­sustainability example that is, above all things, spec-
tacular fun. The 2012–13 Annual Sustainability Report 
explains how:
The Eden Project tells the story of people’s dependence 
on the natural world, of regeneration and what people 
can achieve when they work together and with nature. 
It is designed to give our visitors a great day out while 
demonstrating, in a serious yet playful way, how indis-
pensable plants and people are to each other; how we 
all can adapt together to this challenging new world; 
and how even the most barren, worked-out China clay 
pit can be transformed into a place of beauty. This same 
message underpins all of our educational and outreach 
projects which explore new ways of living in the 21st 
century. Eden is also a social enterprise, demonstrating 
that doing business while improving the environment 
and livelihoods and building stronger communities can 
work hand in hand.9
The Eden Project identifies three essential elements in 
its approach to this task:
● Educational programmes – This includes the design 
of the site, and all the events that happen there, 
many of which are connected with schools and 
colleges or seek to convey important social mes-
sages.10 Recent activities include an ‘Empty Class-
rooms Day’ in July, a national event to encourage 
schools to make the most of outdoor spaces and 
use them to animate lessons, and, in collabora-
tion with Anglia Ruskin University, the launch of 
a masters-level programme, the ‘MSc Sustainabil-
ity: Working for Positive Change’, some of which is 
delivered at the Eden site.
● Operational practice – Eden believes the way it 
runs the site should be an inspiration and example 
to both commercial corporations and public bod-
ies; this is part of its aim to develop the notion and 
currency of social enterprises. As well as its ‘waste-
neutral’ ambitions, the project has partnered with 
EGS Energy to build a geothermal electricity plant 
that will not only power the project, but contribute 
to the national grid.
● Spreading Eden’s mission through outreach activi-
ties and acting as an agency for change – This 
aspect involves using the Eden venue to host both 
major events that facilitate dialogue about signifi-
cant environmental matters and smaller courses and 
programmes to teach horticultural techniques. There 
are business development programmes, team-build-
ing workshops and corporate away days, and courses 
to help teachers integrate outdoor activities into the 
school curriculum.
The educational purpose that underlies the Eden 
Project shows that this is, indeed, far more than just 
another garden. The achievement of these objectives 
requires both focused and decisive leadership, but also 
powerful teamwork.
Taking a lead
The television series Gardeners of Eden11, which pre-
sented a year in the life of the Eden Project, gives some 
insight into both the nature of Tim Smit’s leadership 
style and the range of activities undertaken by the dif-
ferent teams required to run the project. It also shows 
some of the very human problems associated with such 
an enterprise, including conflicts of interest between 
the project’s main purpose and some of the professional 
teams whose tasks are to contribute to that objective.
Smit generally dresses casually and has the slightly 
scruffy air of someone who is not accustomed to spend-
ing much of his working day in an office or behind a 
desk. In a Guardian article prior to a major lecture at the 
Royal Society of Arts (RSA), the interviewer noted some 
of Smit’s key qualities:
Smit's secret, if there is one, seems to be that he can 
bring people of very different disciplines and skills 
together, get them to brainstorm and collaborate, and 
come up with the extraordinary. The Eden Project, he 
says, has attracted locals by the score, but also high-fly-
ing artists, businessmen, architects, scientists, engineers, 
educationalists, horticulturalists and ecologists from all 
over Britain. ‘It feels like a renaissance organisation,’ 
says one woman who left a senior management job 
to work there as a director and has been amazed both 
at what gets done and the way it works. ‘It's attracted 
a critical mass of people, and there's this passionate 
belief, right through the project, that it belongs to eve-
ryone who works there, that it's a team thing. I guess 
it demonstrates that you can have an organisation 
that is highly effective financially, environmentally and 
socially. It's a kind of experiment to show that you can 
work in different ways.’ A local woman who has been 
with Eden since the start is more succinct: ‘It's the most 
equal place I've known,’ she says.
‘This is a stage for change,’ says Smit, who admits that 
Eden can seem like a sect to outsiders. ‘Many people 
have made life choices to come here. Most could earn 
➔

Part 3  Groups, leadership and management
five times as much elsewhere. But I'm aware that if you 
want to effect real change, and we do, that you must 
not own it. You have got to make sure that it's owned 
by more than one person.’12
Smit is described as optimistic and positive, with a mis-
sion to make people think differently. He is concerned to 
challenge dogma from all sides and is happy to question 
the views of committed environmentalists like José Bové, 
as well as those of traditionalists. Although educational, he 
is convinced that the Eden Project need not be stuffy or 
seek to preach; above all, fun, excitement and spectacle 
are integral to the educational process. This lays him open 
to the accusation that it is no more than a ‘green theme 
park’; indeed his desire to make the project a centre for 
spectacle and display brings him into conflict with the 
horticulturalists on the site. In the year of filming, it is clear 
that the two managers of the biomes deeply resent the 
disturbance and damage done to their plants by teams of 
electricians hired to lay lighting cables in and around the 
buildings to support some of the spectacles and events 
that are planned. A third curator-in-waiting is frustrated 
that the project to build the dry tropics biome, which is 
planned to house his extensive cactus and succulent col-
lection, has been put back by several years, leapfrogged 
by the project to build the ‘Core’ education centre.
Smit is also very ‘hands-on’ in the sense that he is 
both integral to many of the special events and equally 
prepared to help with selling tickets and guiding visitors 
on the peak season ‘tricky days’ – peak visitor days on 
which staff who do not normally work with visitors are 
encouraged to follow his example and pitch in to help 
keep the operation moving.13
Working in paradise
By 2014, the Eden Project had grown to be a major local 
employer with almost 500 staff on the payroll, and some 
400 or more additional volunteer workers who are drafted 
in to help with peak seasonal activities such as horticulture 
and visitor operations. A regular internship programme 
brings in new graduates, helping them build their CVs and 
network with professionals in their field while developing 
practical skills in the workplace. The workforce is focused 
into a number of ‘Eden Teams’, the main one being the 
Destination Team. This team includes the Green Team 
of horticultural curators and other experts who manage 
the biomes and the planting, but in addition the people 
who run events and exhibitions as well as the retail and 
catering operations. This team is very much the ‘front of 
house’, as the gardeners work in the public eye during the 
day. However, as the programme shows, they also work 
outside opening hours, often at night, to carry out certain 
potentially hazardous activities, such as lopping unsta-
ble branches from trees in the rainforest. It is also clear 
from the series that there can be significant differences of 
opinion and interest between the Green Team and Smit. 
This came to the fore when Smit planned the first major 
winter event, the ‘Time of Gifts’ festival. This was partly an 
attempt to increase winter visitor numbers to the site, but 
required special construction (of an ice rink) and lighting 
in order to accommodate a variety of story-telling activi-
ties in the biomes, as well as ‘light-and-magic’ processions 
and shows. The whole event clearly opened something 
of a rift between members of the Green Team and Smit, 
since many felt that their values were being compromised 
and the whole project was becoming a sort of Disney-
land. One curator told the BBC crew that the events not 
only did physical damage, but also damaged the morale 
of staff. Not only were curators upset, but the catering 
and housekeeping staff were also very concerned by the 
heavy demands (not least of which was having to learn to 
skate!) that would be made, and Smit is seen running a 
fairly fraught staff meeting with Destination Team person-
nel in an attempt to encourage them and gain extra com-
mitment. When the event was successful, the staff were 
thrown a celebratory party, but nevertheless some of the 
Green Team were absent in protest. Smit explains his view 
about this conflict of interests:
I’m not into horticulture; my role isn’t horticulture. My 
job is to fizz people into getting excited about horti-
culture, which is a very very different activity. And 
actually, the certainties that horticulturalists want are 
exactly the sort of thing I want to shake up.14
While the Destination Team is clearly the face of the 
Eden Project, other teams include the Foundation 
Team, which works with supporters of the project and 
also looks outwards to develop education and other 
scientific and technological projects; the Marketing 
Team and the Communications Team, which run an in-
house publishing company as well as more traditional 
communications activities including the website; the 
Development Team, which is involved with major pro-
jects such as building and includes people from partner 
organisations such as architects and construction com-
panies; the Finance Team, which ensures the project is 
economically viable and fully accountable to its various 
stakeholders; the Creative Team, which develops and 
produces events, including the regular concerts, many 
of which feature major pop and rock artists (Elton John 
played to 6,000 people there in June 2015); and the 
Organisational Development Team, which ‘looks after

Structure, strategy and effectiveness

 Structure is the defining feature of a work organisation. However good the goals and objectives, systems of man-
agement or quality of its members, an organisation will not achieve optimum performance without a sound and 
appropriate structure. 
 Give YOUR critical view of this assertion. What do YOU expect to learn from YOUR study of organisation structure? 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 it is by means of structure that the work of the organisation is carried 
out. Structure provides the framework of an organisation and its pattern 
of management. Some structure is necessary to make possible the 
eff ective performance of key activities and to support the eff orts of 
staff . The manager needs to understand the importance and eff ects of 
structure, and the variables that infl uence the most appropriate structure 
for a particular organisation.

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design

The purpose and importance of structure
The purpose of structure is the division of work among members of the organisation and the 
co-ordination of their activities so they are directed towards the goals and objectives of the 
organisation. Structure makes possible the application of the process of management and cre-
ates a framework of order and command through which the activities of the organisation can 
be planned, organised, directed and controlled. The structure defines tasks and responsibili-
ties, work roles and relationships, and channels of communication.
Underlying the effective management of people is the requirement for a clear understanding 
of the nature of the business in which the organisation is engaged. If the organisation is to be 
successful then its structure must be related to its objectives and to its strategy. Structure must 
be designed to be appropriate to environmental influences, the continued development of the 
business and the management of opportunities and risks. There is obviously a close relation-
ship between organisation structure and corporate strategy (discussed in Chapter 14). It is by 
means of the organisation’s structure that its goals and objectives are attained.
Structure is clearly important for any organisation, whatever its size. However, in the 
smaller organisations there are likely to be fewer problems of structure. The distribution of 
tasks, the definition of authority and responsibility, and the relationship between members of 
the organisation can be established on a more personal and informal basis. With increasing 
size, however, there is greater need for a carefully designed and purposeful form of organi-
sation. There is need for a formal organisation structure. There is also need for a continual 
review of structure to ensure that it is the most appropriate form for the particular organisa-
tion, and in keeping with its growth and development.
Structure provides the framework for the activities of the organisation and must harmonise 
with its goals and objectives. The purpose of structure may be summarised as to provide for:
● economic and efficient performance of the organisation and level of resource utilisation;
● monitoring activities of the organisation;
● accountability for areas of work undertaken by groups and individual members of the 
organisation;
● co-ordination of different parts of the organisation and different areas of work;
● flexibility in order to respond to future demands and developments, and to adapt to chang-
ing environmental influences; and
● social satisfaction of members working in the organisation.1
Structure, though, is not an end in itself but a means of improving organisational perfor-
mance. According to Drucker, it is the correct design of structure that is of most significance 
in determining organisational performance.
Good organisation structure does not by itself produce good performance. But a poor organisa-
tion structure makes good performance impossible, no matter how good the individual manag-
ers may be. To improve organisation structure . . . will therefore always improve performance.2
The importance of good structure is also emphasised by Child:
In the final resort, it is vital that we understand what organization is, what it does, and 
the grounds on which it can be justified because it is not just a means to achieving better 
economic performance but also exerts a profound influence on the societies in which we 
live . . . The form of organization we employ transports values back into society and carries 
a message about how to treat other people.3
The human element
The functions of the formal structure, and the activities and defined relationships within it, 
exist independently of the members of the organisation who carry out the work. Structure 
should be designed, therefore, so as to encourage both the willing participation of members of 

396
part 4 STrucTure, STraTegY and eFFecTiVeneSS
the organisation and eff ective organisational performance.  Lord Forte, for example, has drawn 
attention to the importance of the human element in organisation structure: 
 The human aspect in a business is vital: you can keep drawing squares and lines, but within 
these squares you must have people and they must be deeply involved with the business. 
If this does not happen, then the lines and squares and the diagrams mean nothing. 4 
 One of the strongest critics of the formal organisation is  Argyris. He claims that the formal, 
bureaucratic organisation restricts individual growth and self-fulfi lment and, in the psycho-
logically healthy person, causes a feeling of failure, frustration and confl ict. Argyris argues 
that the organisation should provide a more ‘authentic’ relationship for its members. Manag-
ers need to consider how structural design and methods of work organisation infl uence the 
behaviour and performance of members of the organisation. 5 
 Lucas points out that rigid structures are all very well but they can and do inhibit free think-
ing, which is vital for creativity. Referring to the parallels between ‘the stage’ and working life, 
Lucas reports on the use of improvisation as a means of helping managers work together bet-
ter in teams, release creativity and improve their presentation skills. 6 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Personalities are an important part of the work organisation. Whatever its formal structure, in practice the actual 
operations of the organisation and success in meeting its objectives will depend upon the behaviour and actions of 
people within the structure. 
 To what extent do YOU think people give shape and personality to the formal structure of YOUR university or 
organisation? 
 Levels of organisation 
 Determination of policy and decision-making, the execution of work, and the exercise of 
authority and responsibility are carried out by diff erent people at varying levels of seniority 
throughout the structure. In small organisations, these activities tend to be less distinct, but 
in the larger organisations it is possible to look at organisations in terms of three broad inter-
related levels in the hierarchical structure: the  technical level, the  managerial level and the 
 community level. 7 These last two levels are often referred to as middle management and senior 
management. 
 The  technical level  is concerned with specifi c operations and discrete tasks, with the actual 
job or tasks to be done, and with performance of the technical function. Examples are the 
physical production of goods in a manufacturing fi rm, administrative processes giving direct 
service to the public in government departments and the actual process of teaching in an edu-
cational establishment. The technical level interrelates with the  managerial (or organisational) 
 level , concerned with the co-ordination and integration of work at the technical level. Deci-
sions at the managerial level relate to the resources necessary for performance of the technical 
function and to the benefi ciaries of the products or services provided. 
 In turn, the managerial level interrelates with the  community (or institutional)  level, con-
cerned with broad objectives and the work of the organisation as a whole. Decisions at the 
community level will be concerned with the selection of operations and the development 
of the organisation in relation to the wider social environment. Examples of the commu-
nity level within organisations are the board of directors of joint-stock companies, govern-
ing bodies of educational establishments that include external representatives, and trustees 

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design
397
of non-profit organisations. Such bodies provide a mediating link between the managerial 
organisation and co-ordination of work of the technical organisation and the wider com-
munity interests.
Divide between senior and middle management
Rawson draws attention to the increasing absence of mutuality between senior and middle 
managers in both the public and private sector.
Traditionally, senior managers have been concerned with setting the strategic direction and 
objectives for the organisation; middle managers with making it happen – resourcing and 
managing the changes. The corollary is that senior managers are concerned with results  
and middle managers with how these are achieved. The divide appears as middle levels com-
plain that their seniors are solely concerned with short-term financial results and as seniors 
reply that the middle strata devote more effort to voicing problems than to finding solutions. 
In both sectors the delayering of organisations has dramatically reduced the resources avail-
able to middle managers. The divide deepens as each accuses the other of pursuing their own 
personal rather than organisational ends. Middle accuse senior of being concerned with their 
own career advancement: senior accuse middle of directing their efforts to protecting their 
positions.8
Blurring of differentiation
In practice, there is no clear division between determination of policy and decision-making, 
co-ordination of activities and the actual execution of work. Most decisions are taken with 
reference to the execution of wider decisions, and most execution of work involves deci-
sion. Decisions taken at the institutional level determine objectives for the managerial level, 
and decisions at the managerial level set objectives for the technical level (see Figure 11.1). 
Movement towards more democratic organisations, empowerment, an increase in knowl-
edge workers and technological advances have contributed to lack of a clear distinction 
between policy, management and the execution of work. Flatter structures, the dismantling 
Figure 11.1  Interrelated levels of organisation

398
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
of hierarchies and virtual teams all contribute to a further blurring of differentiation. The 
three broad levels do, however, provide a basis for a critical analysis of the interrelated activi-
ties of the organisation.
Underlying dimensions of  
organisation structure
There are many variables that influence the most appropriate organisation structure and sys-
tem of management. There is nevertheless an underlying need to establish a framework of 
order and system of command by which the work to be undertaken is accomplished success-
fully. These principles and considerations are not prescriptive but present a series of initial 
important decision points for design of organisation structure, or in reviewing the effective-
ness of an existing structure (see Figure 11.2).

 task and element functions 
 In order to produce some product, or provide some service, there are four essential functions 
that the organisation must perform: 
  1.  The product or service must be developed. 
  2.  Something of value must be created – the production or manufacture of a product or provi-
sion of a service. 
  3.   The product or services must be marketed, and distributed or made available to those who 
are to use them. 
  4.  Finance is needed in order to make available resources for the development, creation and 
distribution of the products or services provided. 
 These essential functions, what  Woodward refers to as the  ‘task’ functions, are the basic 
activities of the organisation related to the actual completion of the productive process 
and directed towards specific and definable end results. 9 Other activities of the organisa-
tion not directed towards specific and definable ends are supportive of the task functions 
and an intrinsic part of the management process. These are referred to as  ‘element’ func-
tions and include, for example, human resources, planning, management services, pub-
lic relations, quality control and maintenance. In the majority of organisations, the HR 
function does not normally have any direct accountability for the performance of a spe-
cific end-task. In certain organisations, however, noticeably in service industries involving 
direct customer contact, HR management can arguably be seen as closely associated with 
a task function. 10  
 Failure to distinguish between the two types of functions can lead to confusion in the plan-
ning of structure and in the relationship between members of the organisation. For example, 
in her study of the management organisation of fi rms in this country, Woodward comments 
on the bad relationships between accountants and other managers referred to during the study. 
One reason for this hostility was the bringing together of two quite separate fi nancial func-
tions essential to the effi  cient operation of a business. 
 People concerned with works accounting tended to assume responsibility for end results that 
was not properly theirs; they saw their role as a controlling and sanctioning one rather than 
as a servicing and supportive one. Line managers resented this attitude and retaliated by 
becoming aggressive and obstructive. 11 
 According to Woodward, activities concerned with raising funds for the business, keeping 
accounts and determination of fi nancial policy are task functions. Management account-
ing, however, concerned with prediction and control of production administration, is an ele-
ment function, and is primarily a servicing and supportive one. Relationships between the 
accountants and other managers seemed better when the two functions were organisationally 
separate.  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Many organisational conflicts arise through element functions, such as human resource management, overstep-
ping responsibilities and failure to recognise the primary purpose as support to the essential task functions of the 
organisation. 
 How valid do YOU think the distinction is between task and element functions? To what extent can YOU see conflict 
between the two functions in YOUR university or organisation?

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Division of work and grouping of people
Within the formal structure, work has to be divided among its members and different jobs 
related to each other. The division of work and the grouping together of people should, wher-
ever possible, be organised by reference to some common characteristic that forms a logical 
link between the activities involved. Work can be divided, and activities linked together, in a 
variety of ways.
Major purpose or function
The most common basis for grouping activities is according to specialisation, the use of the 
same set of resources, or the shared expertise of members of staff. It is a matter for decision 
in each organisation as to which activities are important enough to be organised into separate 
functions, departments or sections. Work may be departmentalised and based, for example, 
on differentiation between task and element functions, discussed above (see Figure 11.3).
Product or service
Contributions of different specialists are integrated into separate, semi-autonomous units with 
collective responsibility for a major part of the business process or for a complete cycle of work. 
This form of grouping is more common in the larger diversified organisations and may be used 
as a means of sub-dividing departments into sections. An example is the bringing together of 
all activities concerned with a particular production line, product or service (see Figure 11.4). 
Another example is a hospital where medical and support staff are grouped together in different 
units dealing with particular treatments such as accidents and emergency, medical or surgery. 
With grouping by product or service there is a danger that the divisions may attempt to become 
too autonomous, presenting management with a problem of co-ordination and control.
Location
Different services are provided by area or geographical boundaries according to particular needs 
or demands, the convenience of consumers, or for ease of administration (see Figure 11.5). 
Examples are the provision of local authority services for people living in a particular local-
ity, sales territories for business firms or the grouping of a number of retail shops under an 
area manager. Another example is provided by organisations with multi-site working and the 
grouping of a range of similar activities or functions located together on one site. Improvement

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design
401
in telecommunications tends, however, to reduce the importance of location. For example, 
administrative staff may no longer need to be located within the main production unit.
Nature of work performed
This is division according to the nature of work performed where there is some special common 
feature of the work, such as the need for speedy decisions, accuracy, confidentiality/security, 
or where local conditions require first-hand knowledge not immediately available elsewhere. 
Another example may be the grouping of equipment or machinery that is noisy or produces 
dust, fumes or unpleasant odours. When common processes are used in a range of different 
activities, this may also be used as the basis of division. This method of grouping includes, for 
example, the decision as to whether to establish a centralised resource centre for all depart-
ments of the organisation or to allow each department to have its own service.
Common time scales
Division according to time scales, for example shift working. In a further education college 
there may be separate departments or groupings to deal with the different needs of full-time 
day and part-time evening students. Another example is in a hotel. Activities in the kitchen

402
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
tend to be short term, especially when guests in the restaurant are waiting to be served, and 
a range of different tasks have to be co-ordinated very quickly. Other activities, for example 
market research and forecasting future room occupancy, are longer-term decisions and subject 
to different organisational requirements.
Nature of staff employed
Division based on a particular skill, special qualification or responsibility – for example, the 
division of work between surgeons, doctors and nurses, or between barristers, solicitors and 
legal executives. In smaller organisations the allocation of work may be on an ad hoc, per-
sonal basis according to the knowledge and skills contributed by individuals. Work may also 
be planned deliberately to give a variety of tasks and responsibilities to provide improved job 
satisfaction or to assist in the training of staff.
Customers or clients to be served
Separate groups may be established to deal with different consumer requirements – for exam-
ple, the division between trade and retail customers or between home and export sales. In 
hospitals there are different groupings dealing with, for example, patients in the gynaecology, 
geriatric and children’s wards. In large clothes shops there may be separate departments for 
men’s, women’s and children’s clothing. Government departments are often grouped by this 
method and work is divided according to whom the services are provided – for example, the 
unemployed, low-pay families, students, people or senior citizens. A further example is the 
provision of restaurant services according to type of customer or customer demand such as 
price, range or standard of meals and speed of service.
Centralisation and decentralisation
The balance between centralisation and decentralisation is one of the major debates in organi-
sation structure. Most organisations necessarily involve a degree of decentralisation arising 
from such features as an increase in size, the geographical separation of different parts of 
the organisation, or the need to extend activities or services to remote areas. Our main con-
cern is with decentralisation or devolution in terms of specific delegation or empowerment to 
sub-units or groups within the organisation such that they enjoy a measure of autonomy or 
independence.
Advantages often claimed for centralisation tend to relate to economic and adminis-
trative considerations. However, such advantages frequently are not realised fully and do 
not lead to an actual improvement in service. There are a number of contrary arguments 
against centralisation, including the criticism that it creates a more mechanistic structure 
and may result in lengthening the chain of command. There are also positive arguments, 
which tend to relate more to behavioural considerations, in favour of decentralisation (see 
Figure 11.6).
Extent of decentralisation
Growing emphasis on participation and empowerment suggests a focus of attention on the 
principles of decentralisation, yet senior management still need to maintain effective co-
ordination and overall control of the activities of the organisation as a whole. The bal-
ance between centralisation and decentralisation will be affected by such factors as the 
importance of decision-making, the urgency of the situation and time scales, and also by 
technological developments, changes in structure, the prevailing organisational climate and 
the nature of staff employed. Decentralisation generally tends to be easier to implement in 

Chapter 11 OrganiSaTiOn STrucTure and deSign
403
 Principles of organisation 
 As mentioned earlier  ( Chapter  2 ),  the classical writers placed emphasis on the requirements of 
the formal organisation and the search for a common set of principles applicable to all circum-
stances. The idea of common sets of principles on organisation and management has been sub-
ject to much criticism. Statements are expressed in non-operational terms and give little basis 
for specifi c managerial action, and tend to view people as a given rather than as a variable in 
the system. However, it is diffi  cult to argue against the principles providing general guidance on 
the structuring of organisations. The basic concepts can be of value to the practical manager, 
 if modiﬁ ed to suit the demands of the particular situation,  including the nature of staffi  ng in 
the organisation. The proper application of these principles is likely to help improve organisa-
tional performance. Three of the more specifi c principles of general interest in the structuring 
of organisations are: (i) the hierarchy; (ii) the span of control; and (iii) the chain of command.

 attention to basic principles and considerations in the design of structure, such as division of work, grouping of peo-
ple and extent of decentralisation, is essential for effective management and organisational performance.

private-sector organisations than in public-sector organisations, where there is a greater 
demand for the accountability of their operations, regularity of procedures and uniformity 
of treatment.  

404
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Importance of the hierarchy
Early writers on management drew attention to the importance of the hierarchy. That is, 
clearly delineated levels of management authority as a means of co-ordination and control. 
However, the changing nature of work has led to discussion on the continuing role and impor-
tance role of the hierarchy and the extent to which managers can rely solely on their perceived 
formal authority within the structure of the organisation.
The importance of the hierarchy is emphasised strongly by Drucker, who asserts: ‘One 
hears a great deal today about “the end of the hierarchy”. This is blatant nonsense. In any 
institution there has to be a final authority, that is, a “boss” – someone who can make the final 
decisions and who can expect them to be obeyed.’12
However, contrary to the view of Drucker, Cloke and Goldsmith question whether we are 
accustomed to and have accepted the hierarchy, rules and managers as an essential part of 
organisational life. Have managers been seduced by the apparent power over others that a 
hierarchical organisation offers and by the disproportionate rewards it can provide to those 
at the top? If so, this is depriving individuals of the chance to develop themselves to their full 
potential and cluttering organisations with wasteful and counterproductive processes.13
Gratton has maintained that, more than at any other point in time, there is a chance to cre-
ate the democratic enterprise.
Over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that through the forces of globalization, 
competition and more demanding customers, the structure of many companies has become 
flatter, less hierarchical, more fluid and virtual. The breakdown of hierarchies provides us with 
fertile ground on which to create a more democratic way of working.14
Note, however, that Child maintains: ‘despite the widespread disparagement of hierarchy, most 
companies find it very difficult to avoid it once they have grown beyond a very small size’.15
Span of control
Span of control refers to the number of subordinates who report directly to a given manager or 
supervisor. It does not refer to the total of subordinate operating staff, that is those who report 
first to another person. Hence the term ‘span of responsibility’ or ‘span of supervision’ is 
sometimes considered to be more appropriate. Graicunas developed a mathematical formula 
for the span of control.16 The limitation of the number of subordinates who can effectively be 
supervised is based on the total of direct and cross-relationships
R = ne 2n
2 + n - 1f
where n is the number of subordinates and R is the number of interrelationships. For example, 
with five subordinates the total number of interrelationships requiring the attention of the 
manager is 100; with six subordinates the number of interrelationships is 222.
If the span of control is too wide, it becomes difficult to supervise subordinates effectively 
and this places more stress on the manager. With larger groupings, informal leaders and sub-
groups or cliques are more likely to develop. If the span of control is too narrow, this may 
present a problem of co-ordination and consistency in decision-making and hinder effective 
communications. Morale and initiative of subordinates may suffer as a result of too close a 
level of supervision. Narrow spans of control can lead to additional levels of authority in the 
organisation, creating an unnecessarily long chain of command.
Chain of command
This refers to the number of different levels in the structure of the organisation. The chain of 
command establishes the vertical graduation of authority and responsibility, and the frame-
work for superior–subordinate relationships in an unbroken line down from the top of the 

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design
405
organisation. Every person should know their position within the structure of the organisa-
tion. Most organisation charts demonstrate that this principle is used widely as a basis for 
organisation design. A clear line of authority and responsibility is necessary for the effective 
operation of the organisation.
It seems generally accepted that for reasons of morale and to help decision-making and 
communications, there should be as few levels as possible in the chain of command. There is 
danger in adding to the structure in such a way that it results in increased hierarchical author-
ity and control, and leads to the risk of empire building and the creation of unnecessary work 
in justification of the new position. However, if efforts are made to reduce the number of 
levels this may bring about an increase in the span of control.
Need for a balanced structure
The balance of span of control and chain of command determines the overall pyramid shape 
of the organisation and whether the hierarchical structure is ‘flat’ or ‘tall’ (see Figure 11.7). 
Broader spans of control and fewer levels of authority result in a flat hierarchical structure as 
tends to be found, for example, in universities. Narrower spans of control and more levels of 
authority result in a tall hierarchical structure as tends to be found, for example, in the civil 
service or the armed forces. There is no one, ideal combination of span of control and scalar 
chain. This depends upon the particular situation for each organisation, but it is important to 
provide an appropriate, balanced structure.

 Formal organisational relationships 
 In any organisation structure, certain formal relationships between individuals will arise from 
the defi ned pattern of responsibilities. There is often confusion over the meaning of diff erent 
terms and their implications for organisation structure, but these  individual relationships may 
be identifi ed as: 
 ●  line; 
 ●  functional; 
 ●  staff ; or 
 ●  lateral ( see  Figure  11.8 ). 
 The design of structure in terms of the principle of line, functional, staff  or lateral determines 
the pattern of organisational role relationships and interactions with other roles  (discussed in 
 Chapter  8 ). 
 Figure 11.8  illustration of formal organisational relationships

 advancement through the hierarchy is seen as an indicator of career progression, recognition of merit and reward 
for achievement. Organisations are a form of social stratification. removing the hierarchy will only cause lack of 
ambition and dissatisfaction. 
 To what extent do YOU think this statement has validity for modern work organisations? How do YOU feel about 
working in an organisation with little or no hierarchy? 

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design
407
In line relationships, authority flows vertically down through the structure – the chain of 
command. There is a direct relationship between superior and subordinate, with each sub-
ordinate responsible to only one person. Line relationships are associated with functional or 
departmental division of work and organisational control. Line managers have authority and 
responsibility for all matters and activities within their own department.
Functional relationships apply to people in specialist or advisory positions, and line manag-
ers and their subordinates. The specialist offers a common service throughout all departments 
of the organisation, but has no direct authority over those who make use of the service. For 
example, the HR manager has no authority over staff in other departments – this is the respon-
sibility of the line manager. However, as the position and role of the HR manager would 
have been sanctioned by top management, other staff might be expected to accept the advice 
that is given. The HR manager, however, could be assigned some direct, executive authority 
for certain specified responsibilities such as health and safety matters throughout the whole 
organisation.
Staff relationships arise from the appointment of personal assistants to senior members 
of staff. There is no formal relationship between the personal assistant and other staff except 
where delegated authority and responsibility have been given for some specific activity. They 
exercise only ‘representative’ authority and often act in a ‘gatekeeper’ role. In practice, how-
ever, personal assistants often have influence over other staff. This may be because of the close 
relationship between the personal assistant and the superior, the knowledge and experience of 
the assistant, or the strength of the assistant’s personality.
In business and governmental agencies, from doctors’ offices to licensing and regulatory 
boards, one may come face to face with people who have established themselves as gate-
keeper to the boss. Gatekeepers aspire to and are rewarded with various titles, like adminis-
trative assistant, office manager or special assistant to such-and-such. But the essential role 
is usually that of secretary to the boss . . . Aspiring gatekeepers typically evoke polarised 
reactions among the office staff . . . Peers, unlike the boss, quickly recognise the individual’s 
lack of integrity and willingness to step on all toes en route to the position of guardian and 
the gate.17
Lateral relationships exist between individuals in different departments or sections, espe-
cially individuals on the same level. These lateral relationships are based on contact and 
consultation and are necessary to maintain co-ordination and effective organisational perfor-
mance. Lateral relationships may be specified formally but in practice they depend upon the 
co-operation of staff and, in effect, are a type of informal relationship.
Line and functional organisation
As organisations develop in size and work becomes more complex, the range of activities and 
functions undertaken increases. People with specialist knowledge have to be integrated into 
the managerial structure. Line and functional organisation provides a means of making full 
use of specialists while maintaining the concept of line authority. It creates a type of informal 
matrix structure (see Figure 11.9).
The distinction between a line manager and a functional manager is not absolute. With the 
increasing complexity of organisations and the rise of specialist services it becomes harder 
to distinguish clearly between what is directly essential to the operation of the organisation 
and what might be regarded only as an auxiliary function. Functional managers may feel that 
their difficulties and work problems are not appreciated fully by the line managers. Functional 
managers often complain about resistance to their attempts to provide assistance and co-ordi-
nation, and the unnecessary demands for departmental independence by line managers. A 
major source of difficulty is to persuade line managers to accept, and act upon, the advice and 
recommendations that are offered. The line and functional relationship can also give rise to 
problems of ‘role incongruence’ (discussed in Chapter 8).
Keohane refers to the challenge of achieving the potential benefits of a more integrated 
approach.

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Why is that? It’s because organisations, quite logically, shape themselves around specialist 
functional expertise. That’s sensible, but it becomes less sensible when the agenda of the 
specialist function begins to overshadow that of the organisation. All too often the functional 
agenda elevates its own views, methods, systems and terminology at the expense of a more 
outcome-focused, clear and simple approach.18
Project teams and matrix organisation
The division of work and methods of grouping described earlier tend to be relatively perma-
nent forms of structure. With growth of newer, complex and technologically advanced sys-
tems it has become necessary for organisations to provide greater integration of a wide range 
Figure 11.9  Representation of line and functional organisation
FUNCTIONAL ORGANISATION

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design
409
of functional activities. Although bureaucratic structures and hierarchies still exist in many 
organisations, increasing attention has been given to the creation of groupings based on pro-
ject teams and matrix organisation. Members of staff from different departments or sections 
are assigned to the team for the duration of a particular project.
A project team may be set up as a separate unit on a temporary basis for the attainment of 
a particular task. When this task is completed the project team is disbanded or members of 
the unit are reassigned to a new task. Project teams may be used for people working together 
on a common task or to co-ordinate work on a specific project such as the design and develop-
ment, production and testing of a new product; or the design and implementation of a new 
system or procedure. For example, project teams have been used in many military systems, 
aeronautics and space programmes.
The matrix structure
The matrix structure is a combination of:
● departments that provide a stable base for specialised activities and a permanent location 
for members of staff; and
● units that integrate various activities of different functions on a project team, product, pro-
gramme, geographical or systems basis.
A matrix structure might be adopted in a university or college, for example, with grouping 
both by common subject specialism and by association with particular courses or programmes 
of study. The matrix organisation therefore establishes a grid, or matrix, with a two-way flow 
of authority and responsibility (see Figure 11.10). Within the functional departments author-
ity and responsibility flow vertically down the line, but the authority and responsibility of the 
‘project’ manager (or course programme manager) flow horizontally across the organisation 
structure.
Figure 11.10  Outline of a matrix structure in a university

part 4 STrucTure, STraTegY and eFFecTiVeneSS
 A matrix design might be adopted in the following circumstances: 
  1.  More than one critical orientation to the operations of the organisation. For example, an 
insurance company has to respond simultaneously to both functional diff erentiation (such 
as life, fi re, marine, motor) and diff erent geographical areas. 
  2.  A need to process simultaneously large amounts of information. For example, a local 
authority’s social services department seeking help for an individual will need to know 
where to contact help from outside agencies (such as police, priest, community relations 
offi  cer) and at the same time who to contact from internal resources within the organisa-
tion (such as the appropriate social worker, health visitor or housing offi  cer). 
  3.  The need for sharing of resources. This could be justifi ed only on a total organisational basis, 
such as the occasional or part-time use by individual departments of specialist staff  or services. 
 Developing an eff ective matrix organisation, however, takes time and a willingness to learn 
new roles and behaviour; this means that matrix structures are often diffi  cult for management 
to implement eff ectively. 19 
 Diﬃ  culties with matrix structures 
 The matrix structure off ers the advantages of fl exibility, greater security and control of pro-
ject information, and opportunities for staff  development. There are, however, a number of 
potential diffi  culties and problem areas. The matrix structure can result in a more complex 
structure. By using two methods of grouping it sacrifi ces the unity of command and can cause 
problems of co-ordination. An underlying diffi  culty with matrix structures is that of divided 
loyalties and role confl ict, with individuals reporting simultaneously to two managers; this 
highlights the importance of eff ective teamwork.  Senior and Swailes make the point that: 
 Matrix structures rely heavily on teamwork with managers needing high-level people man-
agement skills. The focus is on solving problems through team action. In a mature matrix 
structure, team members are managed simultaneously by two diff erent managers – one is 
their functional line manager and the other the team or project leader. This type of organi-
zational arrangement, therefore, requires a culture of co-operation, with supportive training 
programmes to help staff  develop their team working and confl ict-resolution skills. 20 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 The idea of a matrix structure may appeal to those critical of a so-called prescriptive approach to organisation design. 
But in reality a matrix structure is an unnecessary complication. it is difficult to manage effectively, hard for people to 
shine and creates more potential problems than it answers. 
 What do YOU see as the benefits of a matrix structure? What is YOUR impression of organisation design in YOUR 
university? Would YOU be comfortable working in a matrix structure? 
 
 Management and organisational behaviour in action case study 
 Working structure: Geoplan Spatial Intelligence Limited 
 in 2000 geoplan, a consultancy organisation in Yorkshire and Humberside, was in meltdown. as well as a growing 
number of market and technological challenges, the company was grappling with a structure that did not work and 
in which all roads led back to Managing director John Taylor. Finance director Sara Mccartney explains: ‘John would 
go out and win new business, which created a buzz of excitement. But this was quickly overtaken by a feeling of 
dread about how we were going to deliver on that promise.’

 Boundaryless organisation 
 The idea of boundaryless organisation originated with Jack Welch, former Chairman of Gen-
eral Electric, in the 1990s. Despite the enormous size of the organisation, the idea was to elimi-
nate internal barriers: both vertical boundaries between diff erent levels of the management 
hierarchy and horizontal boundaries between diff erent departments; and external barriers 
between the company, suppliers and customers. The concept has been popularised by  Ashke-
nas and colleagues. 21  A number of organisations have since attempted to follow this idea. 
 Francesco and Gold refer to the globalisation of the economy that has created new types 
of structures such as the ‘boundaryless organization’, which breaks the traditional demarca-
tions of authority and task specialisation associated with bureaucracies and other structures: 
‘Features of a boundaryless organization include a widespread use of project teams, interfunc-
tional teams, networks, and similar structural mechanisms, thus reducing boundaries that typ-
ically separate organizational functions and hierarchical levels.’ A key management challenge 
is the socialisation and training of members of the organisation away from the eff ects of the 
 John and Sara realised that they had to fi nd a better way of working. This meant fi nding a way of decentralising 
the business to get away from a line management structure that put John – and everyone else – under huge pressure. 
They also recognised that they needed to invest in developing their people if they were going to succeed. 
 initially geoplan used a facilitator to help John share his vision and mission for the company, something he found 
diﬃ  cult: ‘it felt like being in a padded cell, kicking it around until it all came out.’ But, ultimately, investors in People 
gave the team a ‘geoplan way of working’. next, geoplan used investors in People to help them develop a new 
‘matrix’ structure for the company. This meant that the business became increasingly self-managed and anyone – 
rather than just John – could lead a project. John credits the leadership and management criteria in the investors in 
People framework with helping him to realise that everyone could be a leader at some point in their role. But now 
geoplan’s staff  had to step up to that challenge. as Sara said: ‘We’ve worked very hard to develop an investors in Peo-
ple framework that helps people to understand their own competences. That knowledge has given them confi dence 
that they know their stuff  and can deliver to global businesses.’ 
 now people focus on outputs and the value they add to the business. eff ective planning and organisation, team-
work and prioritisation have delivered a signifi cant increase in performance. 
 in 2003, geoplan was making a loss of nearly half a million pounds a year. in 2011, it made a profi t of £400,000. 
The value of the average contract has risen from £20,000 to £150,000–£200,000, and productivity has gone up from 
£56,000 per head in 2002 to £93,000 per head in 2011. geoplan puts its improved results down to the increased 
confi dence and ability of its people, who now form project teams to win new business and work much more closely 
with clients. They win and retain more customers, and their improved performance has enabled them to move from 
‘data assembly’ work to large, bespoke jobs where geoplan can add value. This consultancy approach is also more 
profi table. 
 involving all staff  in management and strategy has also enabled geoplan to cope with rapid technological change 
in its sector. This meant geoplan had to change from being a desktop-based business used by specialists, to online 
systems used by a wide range of business customers and sectors. This change has also enabled it to expand from 
being a uK business to working with global clients such as TnT and KFc owners Yum! Brands. John says that inves-
tors in People also helps geoplan ‘to explain to a billion-pound business why they should work with you rather than 
a big company’.

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
bureaucratic mentality. Although there is still some form of authority structure, and task and 
political boundaries, such boundaries are flexible and unlike the rigid horizontal and vertical 
dimensions of traditional organisations.22
Advances in ICT and the growth of social networking together with the general movement 
towards less rigid chains of command and empowered teamwork have given impetus to the 
boundaryless organisation. However, as Nicholson points out:
Of course, no organisation can function without boundaries – they just sometimes become 
less visible. Neither might it be desirable – boundaries can actually foster freedom by making 
people safe.23
Effects of a deficient organisation structure
It is not easy to describe, in a positive manner, what constitutes a ‘good’ or effective organisa-
tion structure, although the negative effects of a poorly designed structure can be identified 
more easily. In his discussion on the principles of organisation and co-ordination, Urwick 
(writing in 1947) suggests that ‘lack of design is Illogical, Cruel, Wasteful and Inefficient’.
In short, a very large proportion of the friction and confusion in current society, with its mani-
fest consequences in human suffering, may be traced back directly to faulty organisation in 
the structural sense.24
Urwick’s emphasis on the logical design of organisation structure rather than the development 
around personalities is typical of the classical approach to organisation and management. 
Despite this rather narrow view, more recent writers have drawn similar conclusions as to the 
consequences of badly designed structure. For example, Child points out the consequences of 
structure deficiencies:
Certain problems arise time and time again in struggling companies. Even at the best of times 
they can point to incipient dangers that have to be dealt with. Deficiencies in organisation 
can play a part in exacerbating each of these problems. High on the list are (1) low motiva-
tion and morale, (2) late and inappropriate decisions, (3) conflict and lack of co-ordination, 
(4) a generally poor response to new opportunities and external change, and (5) rising costs.25
Organisation charts
The structure of an organisation may be depicted in the form of a chart that provides a picto-
rial representation of the overall shape and structural framework of the organisation. Some 
charts are very sketchy and give only a minimum amount of information. Other charts give 
varying amounts of additional detail, such as an indication of the broad nature of duties and 
responsibilities of the various units.
Charts are usually displayed in a traditional, vertical form such as those already depicted in 
Figures 11.5 and 11.6. They can, however, be displayed either horizontally with the informa-
tion reading from left to right, or concentrically with top management at the centre. Organisa-
tion charts are useful in explaining the outline structure of an organisation. They may be used 
as a basis for the analysis and review of structure, and for formulating changes. The chart may 
indicate apparent weaknesses in structure such as, for example:
● too wide a span of control;
● overlapping areas of authority;
● too long a chain of command;
● unclear reporting relationships and/or lines of communication;
● unstaffed functions.

Chapter 11 OrganiSaTiOn STrucTure and deSign
413
 Probably the most immediate and accessible way to describe any formal organisation is to 
outline its structure. For the student of organisations, knowledge of its structure is indispen-
sable as a fi rst step to understanding the processes which occur within it. When asked to 
describe their organisation, managers will frequently sketch an organisation chart to show 
how their organisation ‘works’. 26 
 Limitations of organisation charts 
 There are, however, a number of limitations with traditional organisation charts. They depict 
only a static view of the organisation, and show how it looks and what the structure should 
be. Charts do not show the comparative authority and responsibility of positions on the same 
level, or lateral contacts and informal relations. Neither do charts show the extent of per-
sonal delegation from superior to subordinates, or the precise relationships between line and 
staff  positions. Organisation charts can become out of date quickly and are often slow to be 
amended to refl ect changes in the actual structure. 
 While acknowledging that organisation charts have some uses,  Townsend likens them to 
‘rigor mortis’ and advises that they should be drawn in pencil. 
  Never formalize, print and circulate them. Good organizations are living bodies that grow 
new muscles to meet challenges. A chart demoralizes people. Nobody thinks of himself as 
below other people. And in a good company he isn’t. Yet on paper there it is . . . In the best 
organizations, people see themselves working in a circle as if around one table. 27 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 although no longer common in many organisations, and despite their weaknesses, a chart portraying a clear repre-
sentation of the overall shape and structure of an organisation with indication of broad duties and responsibilities of 
various units can serve many useful features. 
 Have YOU seen an organisation chart for YOUR own university or department? If so, how helpful was it? If not, in 
what ways would a chart be beneficial to YOU? 
 A summary of formal organisations and organisation charts is set out in the concept map 
in  Figure  11.11 . 
 Variables infl uencing organisation structure 
 Earlier approaches to organisation and management  (discussed in  Chapter  2 ) believed in one 
best form of structure and tended to concentrate on limited aspects of organisation. They also 
tended to study the organisation in isolation from its environment. According to  Bouchikhi 
and Kimberly,  a feature that diff erentiates the nineteenth-, twentieth- and twenty-fi rst-century 
management paradigms is that as customers and shareholders have been more proactive, mar-
ket-driven strategies and fl exible organisations have developed as a consequence. The chang-
ing nature of the work environment, the increasing demands for fl exibility and concerns with 
the contextual factors infl uencing structure have drawn attention to the contingency approach 
to organisation design. 28 
 Contingency approach 
 The  contingency approach can be seen as a development of the systems approach; it goes a 
stage further in relating the environment, and other variables, to specifi c structures of organi-
sation. The contingency approach takes the view that there is no one best, universal structure.

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design
415
There are a large number of variables, or situational factors, that influence organisation design 
and performance. The contingency approach emphasises the need for flexibility.
As Vecchio puts it: ‘The goal of the contingency view is to explain how differences in 
the contextual and structural dimensions are related. As the term contingency implies, this 
approach does not seek universal principles that can be used for every situation, but instead 
seeks to explain how one attribute or characteristic depends upon another.’29 The most appro-
priate structure is dependent, therefore, upon the contingencies of the situation for each 
individual organisation. These situational factors account for variations in the structure of 
different organisations.
Lynch points out that ‘Every organisation is unique in size, products or services, people, 
leadership and culture’ and provides helpful examples of some of the possible implications for 
organisation design (see Figure 11.12).30
Situational factors may be identified in a number of ways. Obvious bases for comparison 
include the type of organisation and its purpose, history, and the characteristics of the mem-
bers of the organisation such as their abilities, skills and experience. Other important vari-
ables are size, technology and environment. A number of studies have been carried out into 
the extent to which these contingency factors influence organisation design and effectiveness.
Size of organisation
Size has clear implications for organisation structure. In the very small organisations there 
is little need for a formal structure. With increasing size, however, and associated problems 
of execution of work and management of staff, there are likely to be more formalised rela-
tionships and greater use of rules and standardised procedures. Size explains best many of 
the characteristics of organisation structure, for example bureaucracy and the importance 
Purpose
Implications for organisation design
●	 ‘Ideas factory’ such as an advertising or 
promotions agency
●	 Loose, fluid structure with limited formalised relationships. As it 
grows in size, however, more formal structures are usually inevitable
●	 Multinational company in branded  
goods
●	 Major linkage and resource issues that need carefully co-ordinated 
structures, e.g. on common suppliers or common supermarket 
customers for separate product ranges
●	 Government civil service
●	 Strict controls on procedures and authorisations. Strong formal 
structures to handle major policy directions and legal issues
●	 Non-profit-making charity with a strong 
sense of mission
●	 Reliance on voluntary members and their voluntary contributions 
may require a flexible organisation with responsibility devolved to 
individuals
●	 Major service company such as a retail 
bank or electricity generating company
●	 Formal structures but supported by some flexibility so that 
variations in demand can be met quickly
●	 Small business attempting to survive  
and grow
●	 Informal, willingness to undertake several business functions 
such as selling or production, depending on the short-term 
circumstances
●	 Health service with strong professional 
service ethics, standards and quality
●	 Formalised structure that reflects the seniority and professional status of 
those involved while delivering the crucial complex service provisions
●	 Holding company with subsidiaries 
involved in diverse markets
●	 Small centralised headquarters acting largely as a banker, with the main 
strategic management being undertaken in individual companies

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
of standardisation through rules and procedures as a mechanism for co-ordination in larger 
organisations.
Size, however, is not a simple variable. It can be defined and measured in different ways, 
although a common indication is the number of persons employed. There is the problem of 
distinguishing the effects of size from other organisational variables. Furthermore, there is 
conflicting evidence on the relationship of size to the structure and operation of the organi-
sation. There is a continuing debate about the comparative advantages of large and small 
organisations, or whether ‘bigger is best’ or ‘small is beautiful’. The conclusion appears to be 
that complexity rather than size may be a more influential variable.31
Global companies and size
Birkinshaw draws attention to size as a particular feature of the structures of global compa-
nies: ‘The reality is that global companies end up being perceived as complex, slow-moving 
and bureaucratic. The challenge for top managers lies in minimizing these liabilities, while 
retaining the benefits of size.’ The pure matrix with equal stress on two lines of accountability 
does not work. Attention must be given to strong but informal horizontal relationships and 
country managers in developing markets. The organisation of a global company depends on a 
host of factors including number of businesses and countries in which it operates, the type of 
industry, location of major customers and its own heritage.32
Technology
Two major studies concerning technology are those by:
● Woodward – patterns of organisation, production technology and business success; and
● Perrow – main dimensions of technology and organisation structure.
Woodward – structure and production 
technology
A major study of the effects of technology on organisation structure was carried out by Joan 
Woodward in the 1950s.33 Her pioneering work presents the results of empirical study of 100 
manufacturing firms in southeast Essex and the relationships between the application of prin-
ciples of organisation and business success. The main thesis was:
that industrial organisations which design their formal organisational structures to fit the type 
of production technology they employ are likely to be commercially successful.34
Firms were divided into nine different types of production systems, from least to most techno-
logical complexity, with three main groupings of:
● unit and small-batch production;
● large-batch and mass production;
● process production.
The firms varied considerably in their organisation structure and many of the variations 
appeared to be linked closely with differences in manufacturing techniques.
Patterns of organisation and business success
There appeared to be no direct link between principles of organisation and business success. 
There was, however, a stronger relationship between organisation structure and success within 
each of the three main groupings of production systems. Organisational patterns were found

to be related more to similarity of objectives and production techniques than to size, type of 
industry or the business success of the firm. Woodward acknowledges that technology is not 
the only variable that affects organisation, but is one that could be isolated more easily for 
study. She does, however, draw attention to the importance of technology, organisation and 
business success.
Another important finding of Woodward’s study was the nature of the actual cycle of man-
ufacturing and the relationship between three key ‘task’ functions of development, production 
and marketing. The most critical of these functions varied according to the type of production 
system (see Figure 11.13).
● Unit and small batch. Production was based on firm orders only, with marketing the first 
activity. Greater stress was laid on technical expertise, and the quality and efficiency of the 
product. Research and development were the second, and most critical, activities. The need 
for flexibility, close integration of functions and frequent personal contacts meant that an 
organic structure was required.
● Large batch and mass. Production schedules were not dependent directly on firm orders. 
The first phase of manufacturing was product development, followed by production, which 
was the most important function, and thirdly by marketing. The three functions were more 
independent and did not rely so much on close operational relationships among people 
responsible for development, production and sales.
● Process. The importance of securing a market meant that marketing was the central and 
critical activity. Products were either impossible or difficult to store, or capacity for storage 
was very limited. The flow of production was directly determined, therefore, by the market 
situation. The emphasis of technical knowledge was more on how products could be used 
than on how they could be made.

418
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Perrow – major dimensions of technology
The work by Woodward was extended by Perrow, who drew attention to two major dimen-
sions of technology:
● the extent to which the work task is predictable or variable; and
● the extent to which technology can be analysed.35
Variability refers to the number of exceptional or unpredictable cases and the extent to 
which problems are familiar. For example, a mass-production factory is likely to have only 
a few exceptions, but the manufacture of a designer range of clothing would have many 
exceptional and unpredictable cases. The analysis of technology refers to the extent to which 
the task functions are broken down and highly specified, and the extent to which problems 
can be solved in recognised ways or by the use of routine procedures. Combining the two 
dimensions provides a continuum of technology from routine to non-routine. With non-rou-
tine technology there are a large number of exceptional cases involving difficult and varied 
problem-solving. 
Technology and structure
The classification of each type of technology relates to a particular organisation structure. Per-
row suggests that by classifying organisations according to their technology and predictability 
of work tasks, we should be able to predict the most effective form of structure. Variables such 
as the discretion and power of sub-groups, the basis of co-ordination and the interdependence 
of groups result from the use of different technologies.
In the routine type of organisation there is minimum discretion at both the technical and 
supervisory levels, but the power of the middle management level is high, co-ordination is 
based on planning and there is likely to be low interdependence between the two groups. This 
arrangement approaches a bureaucratic structure. In the non-routine type of organisation 
there is a high level of discretion and power at both the technical and supervisory levels, co-
ordination is through feedback and there is high group interdependence. This model resembles 
an organic structure.
Uncertain external environment
Two important studies that focused not just on technology but also on the effects of uncer-
tainty and a changing external environment on the organisation, and its management and 
structure, are those by:
● Burns and Stalker – divergent systems of management practice, ‘mechanistic’ and ‘organic’; and
● Lawrence and Lorsch – the organisation of specific departments, and the extent of ‘differ-
entiation’ and ‘integration’.
Burns and Stalker – mechanistic and  
organic structures
The study by Burns and Stalker was an analysis of twenty industrial firms in the UK and the 
effects of the external environment on their pattern of management and economic perfor-
mance. The firms were drawn from a number of industries: a rayon manufacturer, a large 
engineering company, Scottish firms attempting to enter the electronics field and English firms 
operating in varying sectors of the electronics industry.36

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design
419
From an examination of the settings in which the firms operated, Burns and Stalker distin-
guished five different kinds of environments ranging from ‘stable’ to ‘least predictable’. They 
also identified two divergent systems of management practice and structure – the ‘mechanis-
tic’ system and the ‘organic’ system.
The mechanistic system is a more rigid structure that is unable to deal adequately with rapid 
change; it is therefore more appropriate for stable environmental conditions. The characteristics 
of a mechanistic management system are similar to those of bureaucracy. An example might be 
a traditional high-class and expensive hotel operating along classical lines with an established 
reputation and type of customer. However, major fast food chains that tend to operate along 
the lines of scientific management (discussed in Chapter 2) also require a mechanistic structure.
The organic system is a more fluid structure appropriate to changing conditions. It appears 
to be required when new problems and unforeseen circumstances arise constantly and require 
actions outside defined roles in the hierarchical structure. A holiday or tourist hotel with an 
unpredictable demand, offering a range of functions and with many different types of custom-
ers, requires an organic structure.
A summary of the characteristics of mechanistic and organic organisations is provided by 
Litterer (see Table 11.1).37
Burns and Stalker point out that there are intermediate stages between the two extreme 
systems that represent not a dichotomy but a polarity. The relationship between the mechanis-
tic and organic systems is not rigid. An organisation moving between a relatively stable and a 
relatively changing environment may also move between the two systems.
‘Mixed’ forms of organisation structure
Organisations tend towards mechanistic or organic, and many will be hybrid – that is, a mix 
of both mechanistic and organic structures – and often this is an uneasy mix that can lead to 
tension and conflict. For example, a group of people engaged on a set of broad functional 
activities might prefer, and perform best in, an organic structure, while another group tends to 
prefer a mechanistic structure and to work within established rules, systems and procedures. 
Different preferences for organisational styles and working methods present a particular chal-
lenge to management.

 A typical example of a hybrid organisation could be a university with diff erences in percep-
tion between academic staff  and non-teaching staff . Academic staff  may feel they can work 
eff ectively only within an organic structure, and tend to see non-teaching staff  as bureaucratic 
and resistant to novel or diff erent ideas. Non-teaching staff  have an important function in help-
ing to keep the organisation operational and working eff ectively, and may fail to understand 
why academics appear to fi nd it diffi  cult, or resent, working within prescribed administrative 
systems and procedures. Universities may also tend to be more mechanistic at top management 
level, with an apparent proliferation of committees and sub-committees, because of their deal-
ings with, for example, government bodies and other external agencies. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Students of organisational behaviour often express a strong preference for working within an organic organi-
sation. But then many express concerns about possible lack of superior competence, clear direction and strong 
management. 
 Why do YOU think this is? In which type of structure would YOU prefer to work, and why? 
 Lawrence and Lorsch – diff erentiation 
and integration 
 Lawrence and Lorsch undertook a study of six fi rms in the plastics industry followed by a fur-
ther study of two fi rms in the container industry and two fi rms in the consumer food industry. 
They extended the work of Burns and Stalker and examined not only the overall structure, 
but also the way in which specifi c departments were organised to meet diff erent aspects of the 
fi rm’s external environment. The internal structures of the fi rms were analysed in terms of 
‘diff erentiation’ and ‘integration’. 38 
 Diff erentiation describes ‘the diff erence in cognitive and emotional orientation among 
managers in diff erent functional departments’ with respect to goal orientation, time orienta-
tion, interpersonal relations and formality of structure. 
 Integration describes ‘the quality of the state of collaboration that exists among depart-
ments that are required to achieve unity of eff ort by the demands of the environment’. It is the 
degree of co-ordination and co-operation between diff erent departments with interdependent 
tasks. Lawrence and Lorsch’s view of integration was not the minimising of diff erences between 
departments and the provision of a common outlook. It was the recognition that diff erent 
departments could have their own distinctive form of structure according to the nature of their 
task, and the use of mediating devices to co-ordinate the diff erent outlooks of departments. 
 This view of diff erentiation and integration was confi rmed in the subsequent study of fi rms 
in the container and consumer food industries. It was concluded that the extent of diff eren-
tiation and integration in eff ective organisations will vary according to the demands of the 
particular environment: 
 ●  The more diverse and dynamic the environment, the more the eff ective organisation will be 
diff erentiated and highly integrated. 
 ●  In more stable environments, less diff erentiation will be required but a high degree of inte-
gration is still required. Diff erences in the environment will require diff erent methods of 
achieving integration. 
 ●  Given the possibility that diff erent demands of the environment are characterised by dif-
ferent levels of uncertainty, it follows that individual departments may develop diff erent 
structures. 

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design
421
Integrating mechanisms
Mechanisms used to achieve integration depend on the amount of integration required and 
the difficulty in achieving it. In mechanistic structures, integration may be attempted through 
the use of policies, rules and procedures. In organic structures, integration may be attempted 
through teamwork and mutual co-operation. As the requirements for the amount of integra-
tion increase, additional means may be adopted, such as formal lateral relations, committees 
and project teams. It is important, however, to achieve the right balance of integration. Too 
high a level of integration may involve costs that are likely to exceed possible benefits. Too low 
a level of integration is likely to result in departments ‘doing their own thing’, poorer-quality 
decisions and failure to make the best use of resources.39
Evaluation of contingency approach
The contingency approach draws attention to situational factors that influence variations in 
the structure of organisations. It is more concerned with differences among organisations than 
with similarities, and rejects assumptions of the classical and human relations approaches and 
the idea of one best form of structure. For its part, however, the contingency approach tends 
to assume that organisational performance is dependent upon the degree to which the struc-
ture of the organisation matches the prevailing contingencies.
Hunt explains the concept of contingency as follows:
The concept of contingency also implies that there is no one, absolute ‘best’ design; rather, 
there is a multitude of possibilities and the best or preferred choice will be contingent on 
the situation being analysed. Universal models designed to suit all situations are therefore 
rejected. This is consistent with the fact that most organizations are networks of a variety of 
bits of design rather than conforming, as one entity, to a particular model. So we might find 
units of bureaucracy, units of matrix structures, units with project teams, units with extremely 
loose, almost ad hoc structures – and all these within, say, the same oil company. In this sense, 
the contingency theorists merely reflected the findings of hundreds of researchers. There are 
common elements in the hierarchies of different organizations but there are also very many 
differences peculiar to the local situation.40
Not every situation is unique
According to Robey, modern contingency theory defines variables ignored in earlier work, and 
directs attention of the manager to contingencies to be considered in the design of organi-
sation structure. However, the contingency approach runs the risk of concluding that ‘it all 
depends on everything’, and the greatest danger is the over-emphasis on differences between 
organisations and the exclusion of similarities. If the contingency approach is to be useful in 
guiding organisation design it should not treat every situation as being unique: ‘Rather it must 
strike a balance between universal prescriptions and the statement that all situations are differ-
ent (which is really no theory at all). Thus, modern theory uses a limited number of contingen-
cies to help explain structural differences between organizations.’41
Organisation structure and culture
The pervasive nature of culture in terms of both external influences and ‘how things are done 
around here’ and common values, beliefs and attitudes will have a significant effect on organi-
sational processes including the design of structure.
Schneider and Barsoux suggest that while managers are ready to accept national culture as 
an influence on the way people relate to each other, they are less convinced of its real effect on 

422
part 4 STrucTure, STraTegY and eFFecTiVeneSS
the structure, systems and process of the organisation. However, the emerging approaches to 
management refl ect diff erent cultural assumptions, and models of management have diff used 
across countries at diff erent rates in diff erent ways. Historical and societal context needs to be 
considered to understand the adoption and diff usion of diff erent forms of organisation across 
countries. Schneider and Barsoux discuss the multidimensional impact of culture on organisa-
tions and management and maintain that it would be a mistake to base a prediction regarding 
structure or process on a single cultural dimension. 
 Managers need to recognise that the relationships between cultural dimensions and struc-
ture (or processes) are not simple cause–eff ect links, but instead, are multidetermined. Similar 
approaches may exist for the same reason. Thus formalized rules and procedures or partici-
pative management approaches may have a diff erent raison d’être on diff erent sides of the 
national border. 42 
 Watson suggests that we must be careful not to treat structures or cultures as if they were 
solid ‘things’ existing separately from the processes and relationships that the two concepts 
are intended to help us make sense of. The structure of work organisations also involves 
the wider context of societal structures and cultures: ‘Societal structures both contribute to 
and result from organisational structures.’ Watson also refers to the closeness and overlap 
of structure and culture: ‘Many of the processes and practices we observe in an organisa-
tion could as readily be said to be part of the structure of the organisation as part of its 
culture.’ 43  
 An interesting set of caricatures for organisation charts of diff erent countries is given in 
 Figure  11.14 . 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 according to the contingency approach, different situational variables may have some relevance for certain types 
of organisations at certain times given a particular set of circumstances. This  it all depends approach is too vague to 
have any practical benefit for managers. 
 How would YOU attempt to defend the value of the contingency approach? To what extent have YOU seen applica-
tions of contingency theory in YOUR university or organisation? 
 the changing face of the workplace 
 Birchall  refers to the changing world of organisations and its impact on management. Much 
of the work undertaken by middle management no longer requires the considerable layers 
of management. Tasks that used to take up a great deal of management time in hierarchical 
structures are now possible with minimal supervision or intervention. Much of the organisa-
tion’s work is carried out in projects. Many managers will fi nd themselves managing people 
who spend much of their time outside the offi  ce. There is a strong move towards the use of 
consultants. Managers will need to be familiar with electronic networks, the operation of dis-
persed teams and virtual organisations. 44 
 A similar point is made by  Cloke and Goldsmith , who maintain that management is an idea 
whose time is up and the days of military command structures are over. 
  Rather than building fi xed structures with layers of middle management, many innovative 
organizations function as matrixed webs of association, networks, and fast-forming high-
performance teams . . . The most signifi cant trends we see in the theory and history of 
management are the decline of the hierarchical, bureaucratic, autocratic management and 
the expansion of collaborative self-management and organizational democracy. 45 

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design
423
Information technology
The impact of information technology has significant effects on the structure, management 
and functioning of most organisations. IT influences the need for restructuring the organ-
isation and changes to lines of command and authority. Computer-based information and 
decision-support systems influence choices in design of production or service activities, hier-
archical levels and organisation of support staffs. IT may influence the centralisation/decen-
tralisation of decision-making and control systems. New technology has typically resulted in 
a ‘flatter’ organisational pyramid with fewer levels of management required. In the case of 
new office technology it allows the potential for staff at clerical/operator level to carry out a 
wider range of functions and to check their own work. The result is a change in the traditional 
supervisory function and a demand for fewer supervisors.

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Most manufacturing and industrial organisations still require the physical presence of staff 
at the place of work. However, for many service or creative organisations such physical pres-
ence is not always necessary. For knowledge workers their work can be undertaken from home 
or where there is access to a computer. For example, Fisher points out that as the technology 
for achieving remote working gets better and cheaper, expectations for remote working are 
rocketing. Mobile working is increasingly hard to ignore and, facing global demands, com-
panies and individuals must decide how available they want to be. Nine-to-five working is 
no longer enough. Some businesses will be able to dispense with fixed premises altogether.46 
Recall also the earlier discussion on information technology and remote teamworking (see 
Chapter 8).
Outsourcing
In order to free management to concentrate on core activities, businesses are making increas-
ing use of outsourcing and a wider range of non-core services provided by specialist service 
providers. A Management Consultancies Association and Management Today survey drew 
attention to a changing relationship between organisations and individuals. The survey refers 
to the significant increase in outsourcing, with some of the highest growth in business process 
outsourcing (BPO) where entire functions are moved outside the organisation. However, one 
of the consequences of increased outsourcing is that the boundaries of the organisation are 
becoming blurred.47
Thomas reports on the increase in outsourcing of legal and company secretarial activities. 
Outsourcing can address cost reduction, lack of expertise or work that does not make a full-
time role, but it is a very radical answer to cost cutting. It may cause more difficulties than it 
solves. When a company outsources an activity, it cannot just forget about it. The company 
and its directors are still accountable for the activity, and need to review and monitor the out-
sourced work.48
Overell suggests that although there is a lack of hard evidence of consequences of out-
sourcing, there are grounds for prospective concern. With outsourcing, power seems to be no 
longer about direct control but about the ability to co-ordinate an intricate web of organisa-
tions, contractors, subcontractors, bit-part players and intermediaries known as a supply 
chain.49
What to outsource?
According to the CMI, outsourcing has evolved into a strategic option for businesses of all 
sizes. Often seen as a threat by employees and an opportunity by organisations, outsourcing 
has nonetheless become standard practice in many businesses.
On the surface, the benefits of outsourcing may seem both straightforward and considerable. 
However, in addition to cost-savings, there are many other factors that lead managers to 
consider outsourcing. These include access to skills and new technology, the desire to expand 
globally, and the need for flexibility both to deal with rises and falls in product development 
demand and to improve ways of delivering products or services . . . If you focus on identify-
ing the core competencies of your organisation and on what differentiates the company and 
makes it unique, then those areas which make up the support, administration, routine and 
internal serving of the organisation will become potential areas for outsourcing.50
In the public sector there have been a number of recent high-profile problems associated with 
outsourcing of major government services. According to Hazlehurst, ‘Outsourcing firms seem 
to stagger from one scandal to the next, with even their Government paymasters putting the 
boot in at times.’ However, as Hazlehurst points out, outsourcing is not privatisation, and it 
is not going away.

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design
425
Outsourcing makes sense . . . we don’t expect local councils to design and build their own 
street-sweeping machines. They buy them from Volvo. So why shouldn’t they buy services 
from experts too?51
Demand for flexibility
The nature of work is being redefined and this has created strong pressures for greater flex-
ibility in patterns of work organisation and in the workforce. A report from ACAS examines 
the need for work/life balance and flexible working:
The hours and times people work have always been subject to change but the pace of this 
change is now more rapid than ever because: customers expect to have goods and services 
outside traditional working hours; organisations want to match their business needs with the 
way their employees work; individuals want to achieve a better balance between work and 
home life . . . Flexible patterns of work can help address these pressures by maximizing the 
available labour and improving customer service. Flexible working can also help to reduce 
absenteeism and increase productivity, employee commitment and loyalty.52
Flexible working arrangements
Flexible working arrangements are a range of options designed to help employees balance 
work and home life and can describe the place of work or the contract of employment. There 
is a wide range of flexible working practices, which in many instances can be used in a wide 
variety of workplaces:
● part-time working;
● annual hours;
● staggered hours;
● job sharing;
● time off in lieu;
● flexitime;
● work at or from home;
● self-rostering;
● mobile working/teleworking.
● compressed working hours;
● shift swapping;
● term-time working;
● career breaks from work.
Telecommuting
Recent advances in computerisation and telecommunications have had a further significant 
effect on opportunities for flexible working. People can work from almost any geographic 
location: from head office, a satellite office, a shared access telecentre; or from their home, 
hotel room or car. An increasingly popular means of teleworking is telecommuting, where 
staff work from home with a computer network, telephone, etc.
Lucas reports on underlying resistance from organisations to flexible working. Despite the 
well-documented benefits, there are many organisations where it is just not happening on the 
front line. Workplace cultures make it too difficult for employees to ask and a ‘can’t do’ atti-
tude is the status quo. There is a different perspective between line managers and the HR 
department. The biggest hurdle is often concerns of line managers about the practicalities of 
a flexible working arrangement and worries over managing performance. However, objections 
often raised are not insurmountable. Managers need proper training on how to manage flex-
ible working practices to make telecommuting a success in their team.53

426
part 4 STrucTure, STraTegY and eFFecTiVeneSS
 Homeworking 
 A noticeable feature of the changing nature of the workplace is the growth in homework-
ing. Most commentators suggest that the benefi ts outweigh the drawbacks. 54 Figures from the 
ONS in June 2014 show homeworkers account for 14 per cent of the national workforce.  55 
ACAS, however, points out that relatively few homeworkers, approximately 5 per cent of the 
workforce, carry out  all or even  the majority of their work at home. The greatest barrier to 
homeworking success is that of trust, and the traditional managerial attitude about employees 
needing to be seen to be considered productive. 
  If we accept as axiomatic the fact that not all job roles nor job holders will be suited to 
homeworking and that exclusive homeworking is not universally appropriate, the question 
that follows is what is the optimum balance between offi  ce and home? In one sense this is 
a futile question since any satisfactory answer will be specifi c to each organisation. But the 
question is helpful insofar as it reminds us that homeworking is an arrangement based on 
balance and not a binary practice, with staff  being located either solely at home or entirely 
in an offi  ce. 56  
 Working from home does not appeal to everyone and it needs to be managed well, especially 
for full-time homeworkers. An increasing number of homeworkers report a feeling of detach-
ment from the work situation and miss the interaction with colleagues. Homeworkers may 
struggle to escape the strains of domestic life and often report a feeling of exhaustion and 
increased confl ict from demands of balancing work and family. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 remote working, telecommuting and homeworking are clearly the way forward and should be the main feature of 
organisation design. attention to traditional views on formal structure, and managerial authority and control, are no 
longer of significance. 
 How would YOU attempt to present a counterargument? To what extent would YOU be comfortable being employed 
by an organisation based largely on remote working and telecommuting? 
 Structure and organisational behaviour 
 It is clear, then, that it is essential to give full attention to the structure of an organisation. 
However, this is not always an easy task. Structuring an organisation involves balancing a 
series of trade-off s. In analysing the eff ectiveness of structure, consideration should be given to 
the formal and technological requirements, to principles of design and to social factors, and to 
the needs and demands of the human part of the organisation. Structure should be designed 
so as to maintain the balance of the socio-technical system and to encourage the willing par-
ticipation of members and eff ective organisational performance. 
 An organisation can be separated into two parts or structures which can then be examined. 
One section is a defi nable structure that will be present in every company, the other is the 
structure caused by human intervention. The latter provides the company with its distinctive 
appearance, and may be regarded as the manager’s particular response to the design require-
ments of organised behaviour. Essentially the eff ectiveness of an organisation depends on 
how accurately human design matches the structure of organised behaviour. 57 
 Trends towards fl atter hierarchies, teamwork, empowerment and fl exible working have reduced 
signifi cantly the importance of formal structures. What really matters is that individuals know 
what is expected of them, work well with other people and perform their tasks successfully. 

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design
427
‘Realities’ of organisational behaviour
The structure or charts do not describe what really happens in work organisations. Individuals 
differ and people bring their own perceptions, feelings and attitudes towards the organisation, 
styles of management and their duties and responsibilities. The behaviour of people cannot 
be studied in isolation and we need to understand interrelationships with other variables that 
comprise the total organisation, including the social context of the work organisation and the 
importance of the informal organisation.
Gray and Starke provide a humorous but perhaps realistic illustration of how an organisa-
tion actually works (see Figure 11.15).58 Heller also refers to ‘the gap between the aims of big 
company organisations and what actually happens. Organisational form and organisational 
behaviour are not one and the same thing.’59
No perfect structure
As Owen points out, there is no such thing as the perfect organisation structure. Every struc-
ture is a trade-off between competing priorities. Building an effective organisation is becom-
ing harder. With increasing size and complexity, challenges of co-ordination grow. Firms are 
becoming more complicated for two reasons: the rise of the global firm and re-engineering. 
The real problems of the cross-border team are about trust, power, belonging and identity. The 
structural revolution is more far-reaching and complicated than simply turning the pyramid 
on its head. The pyramid has been turned on its side and completely reconfigured.

  The simplicity and certainty of the functional organisation has given way to the complex-
ity of a multi-dimensional matrix in which processes count as much as functions . . . The 
challenge is to make the current style of organisation work. Many fi rms manage new style 
structures with old systems, then wonder why it does not work. 60 
 Whatever its structure, the various operations of the organisation have to be distributed among 
its members. It is necessary to plan, organise, direct and control their activities. The demand 
for fl exibility and greater freedom and autonomy for individuals raises questions about the 
extent and nature of delegation and empowerment, the manager–subordinate relationship 
and the maintenance of management control within the formal structure of the organisation. 
 (This is discussed more fully in  Chapter  13 .) 
 Critical review and refl ection 
  We trained very hard, but it seemed every time we were beginning to form into teams we would be reorganised. 
I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising and a wonderful method it 
can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, ineﬃ  ciency and demoralisation. 
 (Gaius Petronius, AD 66) 
 To what extent do YOU think this is still true for a modern work organisation? Can YOU relate an example of reorganisa-
tion in YOUR university or organisation that has been clearly beneficial? 
 ten key points to remember 
  1   The purpose of structure is the division of work among members of the organisation, and the 
means by which its goals and objectives are achieved. 
  2   Structure makes possible application of the process of management and creates a framework 
of order and system of command for the activities of the organisation. 
  3  attention is focused on certain underlying dimensions in the design of organisation structure. 
These are not prescriptive but provide important decision points. 
  4  critical decisions arise from division of work and grouping of activities, centralisation and 
decentralisation, role of the hierarchy and formal organisational relationships. 
  5  The need to integrate a wide range of activities has focused attention on more fl exible forms of 
structure, such as line and functional, project teams and matrix organisation. 
  6  The contingency approach suggests there is no one best structure but a number of situational 
variables infl uencing organisation design and performance. 
  7   Situation variables may be identifi ed in a number of ways, including size, technology and 
external environment, and arguably the infl uence of culture. 
  8  The changing nature of the workplace has drawn attention to infl uences such as information 
technology and demands for fl exibility on organisation structure. 
  9  it is essential to give full attention to structuring an organisation but this is not an easy task. 
consideration should be given to the realities of organisational behaviour. 
  10  There is no perfect structure. Organisation design involves balancing a series of trade-off s and 
attention to both the needs of staff  and eff ective performance.

 The John Lewis Partnership is a visionary and 
successful way of doing business, boldly putting the 
happiness of Partners at the centre of everything 
it does. It’s the embodiment of an ideal, the 
outcome of nearly a century of endeavour to 
create a different sort of company, owned by 
Partners dedicated to serving customers with 
flair and fairness. All 90,000 permanent staff 
are Partners who own over 40 John Lewis shops 
across the UK, over 300 Waitrose supermarkets 
(  www.waitrose.com  ), an online and catalogue 
business,   johnlewis.com  , a production unit and a 
farm. The business has annual gross sales of over 
£10bn. Partners share in the benefits and profits of 
a business that puts them first. 61 
 John Lewis opened his Oxford Street department store 
for business in 1864. in its early days it was a traditional 
family-owned business, and his two sons followed him 
into the fi rm. John Spedan Lewis, later to found the 
John Lewis Partnership, became director of a second 
store (Peter Jones’ in Sloane Square) in 1905. When he 
inherited the whole enterprise in 1928, Spedan Lewis 
drew up the First Trust Settlement, which left him in 
control of the business but gave employees shares in its 
profi ts. Shortly before the Second World War the busi-
ness acquired the Waite, rose and Taylor grocery stores, 
and in 1950 the Second Trust Settlement created the 
John Lewis Partnership (JLP) as it is today, owned and 
run entirely by its employees. John Spedan Lewis died 
in 1963. 
 as a business, the John Lewis Partnership is therefore 
organisationally very diff erent to its major rivals in the 
uK. it operates in a variety of highly competitive busi-
ness environments: the uK food retail business is domi-
nated by Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Walmart (asda); and 
John Lewis department stores compete not only with 
other department stores, but also with specialist high-
street retailers of clothing, electrical goods, furniture and 
furnishings. Success in these markets requires very high 
standards of eﬃ  ciency and eff ectiveness, and it is inter-
esting to consider the extent to which JLP’s distinctive 
organisation and culture explain its success.

Chapter 11  Organisation structure and design

How successful is it, and how is it 
successful?
The Constitution states that ‘the happiness of its 
members’ is the Partnership’s ultimate purpose, 
recognising that such happiness depends on 
having a satisfying job in a successful business. It 
establishes a system of ‘rights and responsibilities’, 
which places on all Partners the obligation to 
work for the improvement of our business in the 
knowledge that we share the rewards of success.62
These words set an unusual objective for a business 
organisation. While many commercial organisations 
consider the happiness of the workforce as one among 
several key aims, few hold it to be an overriding one. 
JLP’s structure is an example of representative democ-
racy: all partners elect representatives to the governing 
Partnership Council; elected representatives account 
for 80 per cent of Council members, with the remaining 
20 per cent appointed by the Chairman. The Chairman 
and senior directors are required to give an annual 
account of their stewardship at a full Council meet-
ing. Further means of communication and decision-
making include branch forums and divisional councils, 
which reflect the various operating units including 
warehouses and factories as well as stores. Partners can 
therefore influence decisions and affect the company’s 
activities; also, there is a direct pay-off in the shape of 
an annual bonus based on the company’s profits. The 
Chairman and other directors must ensure the continu-
ing solvency of the business as well as keeping funds 
available for growth, but, beyond whatever is neces-
sary for these purposes, the annual profits are redistrib-
uted to members. All partners receive bonuses, which 
are calculated as a percentage of their base pay; in the 
financial year 2013–14 this resulted in £202.5 million 
of profit being redistributed at a rate of 15 per cent of 
salary.63 In some years this has gone as high as 22 per 
cent, although a range of 9–15 per cent appears to be 
more usual. This direct form of ‘industrial democracy’ 
and high level of worker participation means that the 
management of the JLP does not recognise or negotiate 
with trade unions.
A further aspect of the objective of ‘partner hap-
piness’ is the extensive range of benefits and services 
that the JLP provides to its workforce. There is a non-
contributory final-salary pension scheme and many 
direct forms of assistance including a loans scheme. 
Holiday entitlements are generous, as are discounts 
on purchases, and the JLP owns social and sporting 
amenities as well as several estates that provide leisure 
activities and accommodation for Partners and their 
families.
Its commercial success, as we have noted, depends 
on performance in some very tough markets. How has 
the JLP maintained and grown its business?
Keeping the customer satisfied
Today, the John Lewis Partnership is the largest 
employee-owned business in the UK. Our 
Partnership model is admired across both the 
private and public sectors. Co-ownership gives us a 
distinctive culture – and a competitive advantage.64
In 2014 John Lewis was voted the UK’s favourite over-
all retailer for the sixth time in seven years in a regular 
Verdict65 survey of customer satisfaction, and Waitrose 
also topped the poll in the food and grocery category. 
Like most retail businesses, the JLP experienced a drop 
in operating profits during the economic downturn of 
2008–9, although the company remained robust and 
rode the downturn better than many of its competitors.66 
The John Lewis Partnership, including Waitrose, has a 
unique organisation structure, which has contributed to 
its business success

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
The introduction of its ‘essential’ range and the pledge to 
match Tesco on the prices of branded goods has helped 
drive up sales and keep customers during the recession. 
Part of its strength has to be the company’s focus on 
quality and to offer value for money; John Spedan Lewis 
introduced the ‘never knowingly undersold’ principle in 
1925.
Taking Waitrose as the main example, this has meant 
a defining principle of ‘Quality food, honestly priced’. 
The effect can be seen in a number of ways, including 
a relatively early decision to integrate local products 
into its range (many major food retailers have preferred 
to stock only products that can be made available at 
all their stores nationally), thus anticipating a growing 
interest in localism and the environmental problems 
associated with long-distance haulage (food miles). In 
2001 its television advertising campaign announced that 
it was selling only free-range eggs, and it has gone on to 
establish links with farmers whose meat and poultry are 
produced according to high standards of animal welfare. 
In 2014 all Waitrose fresh beef, pork, chicken, hens’ eggs 
and milk were produced in the UK, and it works with 
feed companies to reduce farmers’ reliance on overseas 
sources of animal feed. In recent years it has become 
an advocate for better standards of employment for 
migrant agricultural workers in the UK through links 
with the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and the char-
ity Migrant Help.67
In 2005, and as part of a broader approach to corpo-
rate social responsibility, the JLP launched the Waitrose 
Foundation, which runs parallel to its commitment to 
fair trade. Operating in South Africa, Ghana and Kenya 
where the company has supply chain links, the Foun-
dation supports local education, training and healthcare 
projects. This was followed, in 2010, by the creation 
of a similar organisation, The John Lewis Foundation, 
which has focused on projects to develop sustainable 
cotton farming in Gujarat. It aims to uphold the Inter-
national Labour Organization standards within its sup-
ply chain, and JLP buyers are trained to ensure suppliers 
treat their workers fairly and uphold human rights and 
well-being.68
Getting the message across
These initiatives are supported by distinctive and 
superior advertising campaigns. The Waitrose adver-
tisements generally focus on the provenance of the 
products and the lives and work of individual producers 
and suppliers in a way that emphasises the relationship 
between producer and consumer, and positions the 
company as a discreet intermediary between the two 
rather than a dominant brand. The John Lewis Christmas 
advertisements have become something of a national 
institution; the breakthrough came with the 2011 televi-
sion advert ‘The Long Wait’, which featured a little boy 
waiting impatiently for the Big Day, with the final reveal 
that he was eager to give his parents their gift (rather 
than get his own presents). It went viral almost immedi-
ately, causing a media frenzy in which even hard-bitten 
journalists admitted that it had made them cry.69 More 
recently the snowman searching for a scarf and hat for 
his snow-lady friend (2012) and Monty the Penguin’s 
surprise present (2014) similarly tugged at middle-class 
heartstrings. Delia Smith and Heston Blumenthal – two 
very different types of celebrity chef – have also helped 
promote both ingredients and ready meals, further wid-
ening the brand’s appeal.
And so?
Any company can start spending money on corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) ventures; all the main super-
markets do and many publicly announce a specific 
percentage of profits for the purpose. What appears to 
make the JLP different is the coherence and integration 
of a number of features, including:
● Structure, systems and culture (the Partnership, its 
consultative councils).
● Segmentation and positioning (its market is clearly 
identified as middle-class educated professionals in 
metropolitan and suburban areas).
● Product strategy and upstream relationships (high 
quality, locally sourced, Fairtrade).
● Customer service (universally appreciated in surveys 
and delivered by people who have every reason to 
care about the difference between adequate and 
very good).
● Specific CSR initiatives (the Waitrose and John Lewis 
Foundations, the ‘model’ estate farm at Leckford in 
Hampshire).
● Marketing communications (innovative, engaging, 
memorable, perfectly targeted and understated).
Twenty years ago, the JLP and Waitrose were admira-
ble but not very exciting. Today, the brand is cool, with 
a seemingly effortless stylishness that makes some of 
the others look flatfooted, loud and desperate. It has 
formed a strong bond with a very profitable niche mar-
ket of customers who love being treated that way. And it 
only works because the offering as a whole fits together 
and is utterly credible.

 Tasks
	 1	 Using the Litterer model summarised in Table 11.1 as the basis for analysis, identify the degree to which 
the John Lewis Partnership and Waitrose reflect mechanistic and organic structures of organisation.
	 2	 Critically review the governing structure of the John Lewis Partnership. What are the strengths and 
weaknesses of such a structure in a fast-moving competitive environment?
	 3	 Discuss and evaluate the possible impact of this democratic style of organisation on the role and behaviour 
of managers. How is it likely to differ from the role and behaviour of managers in a more traditional, 
shareholder-owned company?
	 4	 The John Lewis Partnership is a UK-based organisation with a global supply chain. What cultural challenges 
might it face in attempting to ensure that its values are upheld by overseas suppliers? How might its 
structure influence its effectiveness in dealing with producers in, for instance, Africa and Asia?

 The wider adoption of mobile devices, social networking, the internet, artificial intelligence and robotics have the 
potential to create mass unemployment in the near future. 
  What are the main arguments FOR and AGAINST this proposition? What kinds of jobs do YOU think would be most 
at risk and what are the implications for management and organisational behaviour? 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Technology is a very adaptable phenomenon and the use of technology 
is common in an increasing range of jobs. The way technology is 
actually used in organisations depends on decisions made by people 
and negotiations between people in particular social contexts. To get 
the best out of technology and the people that use it, managers need to 
understand the nature of technological change, its organisational and 
human resource dimensions and its circumstances of use. 
 Learning outcomes 
 After completing this chapter you should have enhanced your ability to: 
 ●  explain the role and increasing relevance of technology within organisations; 
 ●  recognise a number of diff erent schools of thought on the way in which 
technology and social factors interact with each other; 
 ●  examine the nature and signifi cance of the process whereby technology is 
brought into organisations; 
 ●  evaluate the involvement of non-technical specialists in technological change; 
 ●  explain the impact of technology on relationships with customers and users; 
 ●  evaluate diff erent schools of thought on how technology interacts with the 
experience of work in organisations.

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Why study technology?
Technology is found and used in all types of organisations. It is the source of new products, 
services, processes and ways of working that create new demands and improve productivity. 
Increasingly, technological change is accelerating and spreading out to parts of the economy 
and organisations previously little touched by it. Technical innovation is affecting the way in 
which workers interact with each other and, increasingly, with customers of the business too. 
Managers need to be aware of the nature of technology and technological change processes 
for four main reasons:
	1.	 There is recurring evidence of technologies being introduced into organisations and subse-
quently failing. Research into technological innovation indicates that change programmes 
often neglect in practice to deliver the anticipated benefits, although the same observation 
could also be made of other types of change initiative.
	2.	 Organisational change techniques (discussed in Chapter 15) are often underpinned by, and 
intertwined with, advances in IT.
	3.	 Many of the insights from ‘classic’ studies of the introduction and use of technology 
remain valid. Today, for example, there is much debate on whether new forms of automa-
tion will herald a mass collapse of jobs; we can learn from previous such controversies in 
the 1960s and 1970s.
	4.	 We are currently entering an era where the evolving design and use of information and 
communications technology (ICT), such as social media and social networking, are likely 
to be associated with further rapid major changes in the organisation of work and busi-
nesses alike.
Human dimensions of technical change
Available research suggests that neglect of the human dimension of change is often cul-
pable in technological failure.1 At the minimum, this might encompass failing to consider 
ergonomic concerns or training. More seriously, managers may fail to consider the applica-
bility of designs to fulfil the intended purposes in conjunction with human operators or to 
consult with users.2 Problems have bedevilled large, public-sector projects in particular. An 
independent review of failures in an electronic patient record system introduced by North 
Bristol NHS Trust in 2012 blamed, among several other factors, inadequate preparation 
and lack of staff training and engagement with the project.3 Similarly, a 2012 National 
Audit Office evaluation of mobile technology in policing criticised the lack of considera-
tion given to how officers would actually use mobile devices in practice and inability to 
maximise possible efficiencies through the use of such equipment.4 At the extreme, lack of 
human understanding and oversight of incredibly complex ICT systems may lead to cata-
strophic failures, such as ‘flash crashes’ in the case of high-speed automated trading in the 
financial services sector.5
Features of technology
Technology is very wide ranging, encompassing innovations from ultra-small-scale nanotech-
nology incorporated in materials to computing. ICT is the technology that most people will 
be familiar with in both work and personal contexts, and it exemplifies many of the key fea-
tures of technological development and how they affect organisations. ICTs are inherently 
flexible; they therefore allow a good deal of choice with regard to how and for which purposes, 
they are utilised in the organisation in terms of such matters as working practices, skill and 
control, and job design, as will be discussed below. Highlighted below are seven of ICT’s 
important features:

Chapter 12  Technology and organisations
437
	1.	 Compactness. The space taken up by a given amount of computing power has shrunk enor-
mously since the time of the earliest working computers, vastly increasing the processing 
power and storage capacity that can be utilised. Decreasing size makes feasible a number of 
the other features highlighted below.
	2.	 Increased portability, because of ICT’s shrinking size and weight. We see this advantage 
most obviously in the ubiquitous smartphone, which combines portability with a high level 
of computing power.
	3.	 Connectivity. This is increasingly important and has a number of dimensions. The incor-
poration of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags into computing equipment enables 
signals to be sent from and received at any location that is within wireless range. The 
increasing use of wireless connectivity is most obvious in innovations such as the mobile 
phone, personal digital assistant and tablet computer. The ease with which many con-
nected ICT devices can be transported increases significantly the locations in which every-
day work tasks can take place. As computing power takes up ever less space, the possible 
range of applications that can be automated grows.
	4.	 Low energy use and hence low running costs.
	5.	 Decreasing cost in relation to increasing processing power, as mentioned above. Again, the 
increasingly favourable economics make technology potentially applicable to a much wider 
range of uses. It also makes more feasible the capture and analysis of large quantities of 
data about human behaviour; this is one aspect of the so-called ‘big data’ revolution.
	6.	 Software that can be edited and reprogrammed, thus providing flexibility of application. 
Operating systems are becoming increasingly intuitive over time, as we see in the growing 
popularity of systems such as Android.
	7.	 Modularity, by linking discrete types of computing equipment together, both in one loca-
tion and across distance, using telecommunications to form dispersed networks, discussed 
below.
Main forms or applications
Technology’s main forms or applications may be summarised as follows:
● Manufacturing, engineering and design technology, for the provision of goods. Nowadays, 
this is often interlinked and draws on common databases.
● Technology used for information capture, storage, transmission, analysis and retrieval. 
This covers many forms of computing and telecommunications equipment.
● Technology employed in the provision of services to customers, clients, patients, etc., in 
service-sector applications, such as in Internet banking or shopping.
● Technology as the product itself, or as a significant addition to the product, such as devices 
incorporating microprocessors or the addition of nanomaterials to existing products (ena-
bling, for example, self-cleaning clothes or glass). Much ICT, such as laptops, notebook 
computers and mobile phones, is equally capable of being used for work or for leisure and 
social purposes. These are essentially a one-stop work and social centre, as they contain a 
keyboard and audio and video facilities, as well as Internet access.
Flexibility and networks
Development has been increasingly characterised by the integration of separate technologies, 
linked to form flexible, dispersed networks. Many now talk of the emergence of a new breed 
of electronically enabled ‘network’-type organisations,6 or even of ‘virtual’ organisations 
reliant on ICTs to conduct business, yet with few physical premises.7 In particular, Manuel 
Castells is perhaps the foremost author to connect recent changes in technology to the devel-
opment of ‘network organisations’ within what he terms a wider ‘network society’.8 For Cas-
tells, the ‘new economy’ is informational (dependent upon knowledge-based information), 
global (because of the impact of globalisation in extending the reach of capitalist markets) 

438

and networked (in the way in which business activity occurs through overlapping global net-
works). Enterprises become more decentralised and make more use of fl exible workers hired 
for particular projects. These workers may also be parts of other networks. Castells has been 
criticised for seemingly attributing to networks a life of their own and for overstating the role 
of technology itself in restructuring organisations and society in some of his work. 9 However, 
his contribution to the signifi cance of networks remains important. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Technology is the tool that enables people to perform. Managers must have the understanding and skills of how 
to make the best use of technology, and knowledge of likely new technologies that could be introduced in the 
workplace. 
 What are YOUR views? How deep an understanding of the knowledge and skills of modern technology do YOU 
believe an effective manager really requires? 
 Approaches to technology and organisation 
 What do we actually mean by the nature of the relationship between ‘technology’ and organi-
sation? The basic disagreement concerns where ‘technology’ begins and ends and the extent to 
which it can be separated from any surrounding social, political and organisational context in 
which it operates, for this decides the extent to which humans can hope to exercise infl uence 
over the development and use of technology. 
 Eff ectively, therefore, there is a debate about where, and whether, a boundary can be most 
appropriately drawn between two aspects to ‘technology’: 
 ●  Firstly, and least controversial, we could talk about the ‘hard’ aspects of machinery, soft-
ware, equipment, processes, and so on, that are mainly subject to physical laws. 
 ●  Secondly, should we include the systems, procedures, work organisation and know-how 
that are subject to social organisation, but also necessary to convert raw material in what-
ever form to a transformed product or service? 
 To what extent are outcomes and consequences of technologies for humans set by inescapable 
physical requirements, or are people able to intervene during the system design or use phases 
to enable diff erent outcomes with the same technologies? There is continuing debate about 
some of the classical views and their historical context, and implications of some of the diff er-
ent approaches to technical change in organisations.  Figure  12.1 provides a general illustration 
of the theories discussed in this section. This is not meant to suggest that a simple division 
exists between ‘technological’ factors that infl uence society on the one hand and ‘societal’ 
factors that infl uence technology on the other; in fact, the construction of each is mutually 
shaped by the other. 10 
 technological determinism 
 Technological determinism, the idea that technology innately and inevitably causes certain 
consequences, has been attributed to several ‘classic’ studies of the impact of technologies 
within an industrial setting. Some infl uential research of the 1950s and 1960s identifi ed associa-
tions between technology and a number of organisational phenomena, including  Woodward ’s 
studies of the structure of organisations 11 (discussed in  Chapter  11 ),  Blauner ’s investigations 
of the degree of job satisfaction experienced by workers 12  (discussed in  Chapter  7 ) and  Say-
les ’ work on the pattern and likelihood of industrial grievances. 13 For example, Blauner drew 

Chapter 12  Technology and organisations
439
attention to the negative consequences for workers of ‘Fordist’ assembly-line technologies, 
visible in lack of job satisfaction, absenteeism and poor use of human skills. Many academics 
and others would argue that such a view of technology is now over-simplified, yet some com-
mentaries on the current ICT revolution seem to suggest that technological change, of itself, 
will alter the structure of industries, commerce and jobs.14
Socio-technical systems
Even during early days in the study of technology, some writers argued that choices existed 
in the manner in which technical apparatus was used. (The systems approach to the theo-
rising and analysis of organisations is discussed in Chapter 3.) Socio-technical approaches 
have a particular concern to find the ‘best fit’ in any given job/work design between the 
social ‘sub-system’ (such as people’s psychological and social needs) and the technical ‘sub-
system’ (such as the apparatus, its requirements, method of operation and physical loca-
tion) of the overall organisational ‘system’. This school of systems design anticipates that 
the ‘best’ overall socio-technical design is a compromise between what would constitute 
the ideal designs on either purely ‘technical’ or ‘social’ grounds alone. ‘Joint optimisation’ 
of the overall socio-technical system requires ‘sub-optimisation’ of its constituent technical 
and social sub-systems.
For socio-technical theorists such as Trist and his colleagues,15 the eventual systems design 
is a matter for conscious organisational choice rather than any technical necessity (as a tech-
nical determinist would argue). Socio-technical analysts have put these views into practice in 
numerous workplace interventions, demonstrating improvements in productivity and social 
well-being by changing components of the overall socio-technical work system. However, 
Kelly argues that, in reality, socio-technical interventions have tended to modify social (work 
organisation) systems of the workplace more than they have redesigned technical systems.16 
Socio-technical systems largely approach the politics of choice in technology at the point at 
which technology is used rather than when it is designed.
figure 12.1  Differing explanations of the relative importance of technological and social factors

440
part 4 sTrUcTUre, sTraTegy and eFFecTiVeness
 The role of non-technical factors in ‘socially shaping’ technology, 17 such as managerial 
strategies, political diff erences between groups and prevailing social assumptions in the design 
and use of technology, is accorded even greater weight in a number of other approaches to 
this issue. All emphasise that technology is in fact a process allowing ‘choices’, although they 
diff er in their relativism and the extent to which they allow any residual role for irreducibly 
‘technical’ factors. 
 Radical/Marxist approach 
 This approach is based upon the so-called ‘labour process’ perspective, originating in  Braver-
man ’s seminal book,  Labor and Monopoly Capital. 18 It argues that, in a capitalist society, the 
only parties to the employment relationship able to exercise any meaningful choice over the 
design and use of technology are the owners of the means of production. Braverman saw sci-
entifi c management techniques  (discussed in  Chapter  2 ) as the main driver to simplify all forms 
of work. Having de-skilled workers, management’s logical next step was to automate even 
these impoverished jobs. Thus, technology is one of the means used by managers to retain and 
extend control and de-skill work, a trend that continues into the use of IT for the monitoring 
and surveillance of work and employees, for example. The key point about the radical/Marx-
ist perspective here is that it is not the technology per se that de-skills jobs (as a technological 
determinist would claim), but the way it is used in the hands of (capitalist) management. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Technology in itself does not reduce the need for the exercise of human skill and decision-making. it is the way in 
which technology is actually applied within organisations that can cause this to happen. 
 To what extent do YOU agree with this assertion? How would YOU attempt to ensure that the use of technology is not 
at the expense of the demand for human skills? 
 Design and use of technology 
 Accepting that the creation, design and use of technology is an essentially social and politi-
cal dialogue opens the door to further approaches to the subject developed mainly by soci-
ologists of technology since the 1980s. These include the so-called ‘processual’ approach, 19 
socio- economic shaping of technology (SST), 20 social construction of technology (SCT), 21 
actor–network analysis (ANA) 22 and technology as text and metaphor (TTM). 23 It is not the 
purpose to discuss these sometimes quite complex approaches in depth, but it is relevant to 
draw attention to some of the main similarities and diff erences in these more sociological 
approaches. Each school agrees broadly that technological confi gurations are the outcome 
of interactions of, and negotiations between, various actors in the innovation process both 
inside and outside the organisation. For instance, processual approaches emphasise the inter-
play between three main elements that can be applied to technical change: what  Dawson calls 
the substance of change (its actual technical content, its time frame and perceived centrality 
to the organisation); the context of change (both within the organisation and in the outside 
environment, including the activities of competitors); and the politics of change (the actions 
and attitudes of actors having infl uence over the change process). 24 
 Diff erent sociological theories 
 Among diff erences between these diff erent sociological theories, three main distinctions are: 
their respective relativism; the extent to which they believe technologies become ‘fi xed’; and 
the infl uence attributed to social structures. 

Chapter 12  Technology and organisations
441
Firstly, the five approaches above differ in their degree of relativism regarding any essential 
manner in which ‘technology’ has a determining core. More than any of the other theories, 
the TTM approach goes furthest in the postmodern position that technology has no objective 
existence beyond the way we interpret it in our own subjective accounts and representations.
Secondly, TTM argues that ‘technology’ is continually being reinterpreted and redefined by 
social actors, therefore there is no point at which it stabilises at a fixed conjunction that can 
henceforth have impacts on other social phenomena. By contrast, the SCT approach argues 
that, although technological innovation is a multidimensional activity involving negotiations 
with many actors about the definition of technological problems and solutions, eventually 
the process will converge upon a particular design option. From that point on, search activity 
and debate is then closed, and the technology is ‘stabilised’ in a particular configuration. It 
becomes possible to talk about ‘impacts’ or ‘effects’ on the organisation in general, working 
practices, skill requirements, etc., although these impacts may be social as well as technical. As 
McLoughlin et al. summarise key differences:
we can conceptualize technology as a stabilized set of meanings following a social process of 
closure [SCT]; as congealed social relations held together by a specific alignment of human 
and non-human actants [ANA]; and as a ‘text’ which is continually being (re-)written and 
(re-)read according to interpretative context.25
A third cleavage between these approaches lies in the extent to which they see prevailing 
social structures as important in influencing the path of technological development. On the 
one hand, approaches such as SST in particular stress the ways in which capitalist or gendered 
ideologies within society percolate into the assumptions of those designing, managing and 
commissioning technologies. On the other hand, relativist approaches such as TTM and ANA 
focus their main attention on the perceptions and activities of individual actors, while neither 
allocates much importance to wider social forces.
Decision-making processes
The above discussion suggests that different parties may be involved in decision-making on 
technologies and organisations. How do particular ‘new’ technologies come to be adopted 
in organisations for the first time and then used and operated in a particular way? Two issues 
relating to that process between them are likely to have far-reaching consequences for the even-
tual success and the acceptance of particular changes. Firstly, the different phases of the tech-
nical change process. In each of these stages, a range of decisions needs to be made by various 
interested parties, although the range of decisions is likely to get narrower and more detailed 
as the introduction process progresses. Secondly, which ‘interested parties’ get involved in the 
various ‘design spaces’ that are opened up at the various stages of the process? Our primary 
concern here is with the impact of decision-making on human behaviour in organisations. 
Therefore, we need to ask: is the decision-making process conceived as mainly the province of 
managers and technical ‘experts’, or do personnel specialists or users of the new technology 
become involved and, if so, to what extent?
Legal or collective stipulations
Decisions are not just a matter of individual organisational preference, but are, in certain 
circumstances, subject to legal or collective stipulations about how the process should be man-
aged, and the extent to which various organisational actors should be permitted to influence 
the process. The prime example of this is the case of the introduction (and use) of remote 
teleworking in organisations within the European Union (EU), which is subject to the 2002 
Framework Agreement on Telework between employers’ organisations and trade unions. This 
affects numerous matters that organisations within Europe are required to take into account 

442
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
when making use of this form of work, recognises the rights of employees to be collectively 
consulted about the process, and requires employers and trade unions nationally to monitor 
the agreement.26 In relation to decision-making processes on technology, the interesting issue 
is the different ways in which this agreement has been transposed to a national level in the dif-
ferent EU countries.
The various methods indicate that there is greater protection and opportunity for dialogue 
in some nations than others. Some countries, such as the Czech Republic and Portugal, incor-
porated the agreement’s provisions into national labour law; countries such as France, Den-
mark and Sweden made national or sectoral collective agreements between their employers 
and trade unions; while in Ireland and the UK national employers’ and trade union representa-
tives agreed voluntary – and relatively weak – codes of conduct that are likely to allow workers 
or unions little influence at workplace level.27 Prosser claims that such agreements can be more 
effectively implemented and monitored in countries with centralised and co-ordinated indus-
trial relations systems – unlike the UK.28
Phases and stages of technology introduction
An important framework explaining the life cycle of the process whereby new technology 
comes into organisations has been developed by Preece, summarised below. It identifies two 
phases: new technology adoption; and introduction. Within these phases, it is possible to cat-
egorise seven separate stages (see Table 12.1 and Figure 12.2).29 The adoption phase consists of 
four stages: initiation; progression/feasibility; investment decision; and planning and systems 
design. During this phase, no technology is yet on the site at which it is intended to be used. 
This happens during the introduction phase, consisting of installation, operationalisation and 
evaluation, where the project actually takes physical shape and becomes established as a tech-
nology in actual use. If problems occur at any stage, the process may loop back on itself and 
recommence from an earlier stage.

Initiation and operationalisation
The initiation and operationalisation stages, shown in Table 12.1 and Figure 12.2, are particu-
larly important. In relation to the first of these stages, our earlier discussion argued that the 
very flexibility of modern technologies means that they can fulfil numerous goals. In initiating 
ideas to bring in new technologies, the sponsors may have various objectives and, indeed, dif-
ferent objectives may well be important to different players in the adoption process. Child has 
applied this to the new technology decision-making process in relation to his idea that man-
agers have ‘strategic choice’ between different types of goal, and much of the argument over 
whether to introduce technology is likely to be over these kinds of issues.30
Objectives may be easily quantifiable financial measures, such as cost savings, or may be 
more abstract goals, such as the capability to manufacture more complex product designs. 
The latter type of benefit is less easily quantifiable according to traditional accounting tech-
niques, but may be of longer-term value to the company. Different occupational specialisms 
may have conflicting concerns, motives and priorities in the introduction of new technology 
and are likely to pursue their objectives in the early stages of the new technology adoption 
process using particular arguments, which may jar with the views being put forward by 
other parties.31
Operationalisation is worthy of mention because it is here that the workforce will have 
a direct impact on the technology, even if the workforce was unable to do so previously in 
discussions about working practices, training and so on (see the next section). Wilkinson car-
ried out an important study of this part of the introduction process, looking at the political 
behaviour associated with organisational and human resource (HR) issues arising out of tech-
nical change on the shop floor, especially as regards the skills and control that are exercisable. 
He demonstrated that a range of choices had been made, and were available, about work 
organisation, control and skill/de-skilling of jobs, and that the outcomes of technical change 
are partly dependent on the (sometimes covert) adjustments made by the users in order to 
optimise technological systems for everyday use.32

Involvement of HR specialists  
and users of technology
As the previous discussion has indicated, one important issue in the above processes concerns 
whether, and at what stage, two groups of interested ‘non-technical’ stakeholders become 
involved. These groups are:
● those charged with management of HR matters within the enterprise; and
● the actual users of the technology.
The later they enter the process, the less far-reaching the influence they are likely to be able to 
have on it.
HR specialists
The role of HR specialists in the new technology adoption process shows how people with 
particular perspectives and expertise on aspects of organisational work can influence the pro-
cess. They are the ‘people specialists’ in organisations and should be aware of issues such as 
alternative forms of job design and working practices, skill and de-skilling possibilities.
While some research suggests that personnel specialists’ cross-organisational brief allows 
them to be technology ‘change agents’,33 the balance of evidence argues that their involvement –  
if any – in technical change is more often belated and reactive.34 Legge suggests that there are 
three main reasons for low levels of involvement:
	1.	 Employees have been secondary to other considerations in the choice and implementation 
of new technology, and thus personnel specialists’ peripheral and reactive involvement is 
only to be expected.
	2.	 As employees typically welcome rather than resist new technology, personnel specialists’ 
involvement did not take off at implementation either (e.g. they were rarely required to deal 
with tricky and complex issues relating to pay, gradings, employment, etc.).
	3.	 Even on the odd occasion when resistance did occur, personnel’s role was not seen as being 
crucial because of the weaknesses and divisions of the trade unions and employees more 
generally.35
Reference to HR specialists
A 2005 survey of its members by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development 
(CIPD) confirms this picture of low involvement. It reported that decisions to introduce new 
technology are taken with no reference to HR specialists in roughly half of the organisations 
surveyed. The reasons volunteered by the respondents mainly referred to such decisions being 
taken elsewhere in the organisation or suggested that they did not have enough specialist 
expertise to be able to contribute. A few respondents suggested that other departments were 
keen to preserve their autonomy and actively to keep HR out of the process.36An additional 
factor is that HR specialists are not directly present in the great majority of UK workplaces. 
For instance, the large-scale 2011 Sixth Workplace Employment Relations Survey classified 
only 22 per cent of its workplace-level management respondents as ‘specialists’ in employment 
relations issues, either by virtue of their job titles or because they spent more than half their 
time on such tasks.37
The CIPD survey referred to above indicated that, at whatever stage of the process they 
were involved, the most common roles for HR specialists were training, communication about 
the change process and the overall management of it. Clearly, those specialists whose expertise 
was sought at earlier stages of the decision-making process were more likely to be involved in 
strategic issues of the overall changes.38

 Users of technology 
 Evidence also indicates that the users of technology are rarely involved in the process of tech-
nology adoption, although they are more likely to have input during the  operationalisation 
stage, in terms of such aspects as working practices, tasks, decisions about methods, and 
tools and techniques.  Fröhlich et al. conducted a survey of workplace involvement in techni-
cal change in twelve EU countries. Only 20 per cent of respondents reported consultation 
or negotiation between management and employees in the adoption stages of technological 
change, but this rose to 33 per cent in the implementation stages. 39 
 Worker involvement was much more likely to occur in countries such as Germany and Den-
mark than in countries with fewer established mechanisms for involving workers, such as the 
UK. The study identifi ed a number of costs and benefi ts of the involvement of workers in 
the decision-making process. Improved utilisation of skills and attending to diff erent actors’ 
concerns were seen as the greatest benefi ts, while extended time scales were the main costs. 
We must remember that user involvement is an inherently political process rather than simply 
‘good practice’. Managers are largely responsible for deciding on the extent, form and time 
scales of user involvement in technical change. 40  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 nothing is to be gained by involving end-users in the adoption and introduction of technical change. They are not in 
a position to make any useful contribution and it is far simpler and quicker to tell them what will happen and what 
they will have to do. 
 To what extent do YOU agree? Would YOU be happy if the implementation of technology was entrusted solely to 
technology specialists? What is the situation in YOUR university? 
  technology, work and organisational 
behaviour 
 In this section we review seven facets of the interaction between technology and the world 
of work. Some of these subjects have engendered lengthy academic debates and controversy, 
while others are emerging areas, particularly where they concern the implications of the most 
recent technological innovations. 
 ●  Technology infl uences the specifi c design of each member’s pattern of work, aff ecting the 
skills exercisable and the overall quality of jobs. 
 ●   Technologies aff ect the degree of control that workers can exercise within their jobs. There 
is a fertile, unresolved debate over whether centralisation and closer control of workers 
or decentralisation and democratisation of technology in the workplace is the dominant 
trend. 
 ●  Technology changes the relationship between organisations and external customers or 
users in a number of ways that have implications for the structure and reputation of organi-
sations, as well as the nature and experience of work within them. 
 ●  Technology aff ects where the ‘workplace’ is located. 
 ●  Technology aff ects the nature of social interactions between workers, particularly in cases 
where those working on a project are doing so from diff erent places. 
 ●  Technology can infl uence the pace and intensity of work. 
 ●  Technology has an impact on job security and on the management of a workforce with 
varying levels of technical ability and awareness. 

Chapter 12  Technology and organisations
447
These factors are likely to affect the experience of work, and therefore ultimately the levels of 
job satisfaction that individuals are able to attain. We should also recognise that many of the 
seven factors are interlinked. For example, the setting-up of offshore telephone call centres 
represents a change in the location of work, but such moves are often also accompanied by the 
routinisation of the tasks in these establishments (a reduction in skill levels) and an expecta-
tion of faster throughput of calls (a change in the pace and intensity of work).
Skill, work design and job quality
The impact of technological change on the nature and variety of job activities performed, 
the skills that workers can exercise, and the amount of autonomy and control they have over 
their jobs have been among the most hotly contested areas in social science. In this section we 
concentrate particularly on skills and work organisation, and argue that different writers have 
associated technology with diametrically opposed types of effect on the skills that workers can 
exercise within their jobs: a reduction in skills, or the reverse trend, where automation is said 
to lead to increased levels of skill. If one looks at the workforce as a whole rather than trends 
within occupations, some writers find evidence of both processes simultaneously, and we con-
sider this view in a later section below.
The influential work of Braverman, mentioned earlier in this chapter, questioned the 
assumption of contributors to the ‘automation debates’ of the 1960s, such as Blauner (dis-
cussed above), that technical change would lead, relatively unproblematically, to rising levels 
of job satisfaction and skills.41 Instead, Braverman argued that automation, in the hands of 
managers, comprised the second stage of a strategy to de-skill and eliminate jobs that had 
started with the techniques of scientific management. The so-called ‘labour process’ debate 
that followed the publication of Braverman’s work spawned numerous workplace studies 
producing evidence either to confirm or cast doubt on Braverman’s original hypothesis.42An 
important insight was that the exact effects of technical change on skill levels depend on how 
managers organise job design and the patterns of work organisation more broadly. Research 
indicates that this varies considerably between workplaces and that it is even possible to iden-
tify differing patterns and preferences cross-nationally on how managers are likely to organise 
work.43 In one example using case studies of similar technology matched across countries, 
Gallie showed how the jobs and skills of operatives varied between British and French oil refin-
eries, with the French workers being able to exercise greater autonomy.44
Nevertheless, the idea of a long-term trend towards de-skilling through the application of 
new technology still holds some purchase,45 despite the claims of those seeing a shift towards 
a ‘knowledge’ workforce (discussed in Chapter 7). Some argue that the concept of ‘knowledge 
workers’ is often used over-simplistically.46 Fleming et al. argue, on the basis of a study of 
jobs in Australia that might be classified as ‘knowledge work’, that many such occupations 
involve merely relatively low-level information-processing skills, and thus it could be mistaken 
to anoint them as ‘knowledge work’.47 Other studies of the use of computing applications 
in different forms of clerical and professional work suggest that many of the ‘skills’ simply 
involve navigating standardised software interfaces, producing increasingly uniform work 
experiences.48
Technology and skills trajectories
The more widespread diffusion of more flexible forms of microprocessor-based automation 
since the 1980s has led other writers to adopt a contrary, but still controversial, view. Prior to 
current debates about ‘knowledge workers’, Piore and Sabel in the USA and Kern and Schu-
mann in Germany claimed simultaneously that new categories of multiskilled workers capa-
ble of programming and overall system control were emerging in manufacturing industry.49 
Zuboff’s studies provided further evidence for why this might be the case. She argues that, 

448
part 4 sTrUcTUre, sTraTegy and eFFecTiVeness
whereas mechanisation had indeed tended simply to ‘automate’ human skill, the novel prop-
erty of ICT was that it generates new streams of previously unavailable information about 
processes that require interpretation by human operators. To use her term, it ‘informates’ pro-
cesses in ways that require new human skills to exploit successfully. 50 Technology’s implica-
tions for skills within the workforce as a whole are potentially complex and will be discussed 
further in the section below on job security and the digital divide. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Just because you are required to use iT equipment to do your job, it does not make you a ‘knowledge worker’. 
 What do YOU understand by the concept of a ‘knowledge worker’? How useful is it as a way to encapsulate the 
nature of working in the present era? 
 Centralisation versus decentralisation 
of control 
 The debate about the eff ect of technology upon skills and work organisation necessarily raises 
the question of the consequences of technology for workers’ autonomy and discretion. In 
other words, to what extent can it be an instrument of tighter monitoring and control or 
of greater liberation in the workplace?  (Organisational control and power is discussed in 
 Chapter  13 .) 
 Surveillance 
 The advent of the ICT revolution has reinvigorated concern with the use of technology as a 
means of workplace control, particularly in relation to the information-gathering potential of 
ICTs and the use to which this could be put in technically monitoring or conducting surveil-
lance on workers’ performance and activity. Contributory factors include the sheer growth in 
the numbers and usage of technologies available to capture and store data generated within 
organisations, 51 coupled with higher pressures on staff  to perform because of increased com-
petition, fi nancial constraints, or large fi rms’ domination of integrated ICT networks in some 
sectors, such as retail. 52 The potential for surveillance encompasses technologies as established 
as closed circuit television 53 through to newer methods such as voice and image recognition 
software and RFID tags, which can be placed in goods and even people so as to enable track-
ing of their location and movement. 54 It is commonplace for RFID devices to be installed in 
delivery vans, for example. 
 The origins of such concerns can be traced back to the writings about ‘disciplinary power’ 
of the French postmodernist  Foucault, and particularly to his popularisation of Jeremy 
Bentham’s proposed design for a prison that perfected the capability for surveillance of the 
prisoners’ activities in their cells: a ‘panopticon’, the literal meaning of which is ‘all-seeing 
eye’. 55 Some writers have expanded this metaphor to encompass the information-gathering 
potential of ICTs to produce the concept of the  electronic panopticon. This literature draws 
attention to the insidious and not-so-insidious ways in which IT has been used by manag-
ers to monitor and record the work of employees, in some cases in such a way that they do 
not know exactly when they are being watched, but are aware that this could be at any time. 
For instance, the systems in telephone call centres typically permit managers to listen in ran-
domly to the calls of selected operatives (a practice usually justifi ed on the grounds of qual-
ity control). However, the operatives have no way of being aware of when managers may be 

Chapter 12  Technology and organisations
449
monitoring their conversations with customers. Hence, it is argued, employees amend their 
behaviour to act as if they are under unseen surveillance all the time, just like the prisoners in 
Bentham’s panopticon.56
McGovern et al. are among the few to employ survey evidence to try to uncover the extent 
of ICT-based monitoring of employees’ work in the UK. Piecing together available surveys, 
they report that by the year 2000 approximately one-half of employees said that a comput-
erised system logged the work they were doing and about one-quarter stated that their work 
was actually checked through the information thus collated. It can be reasonably assumed 
that these proportions are likely to have increased in the intervening years. There seemed to 
be little variation between different occupational categories in the likelihood of such remote 
checking.57
Caution and uncertainty
Mason et al. strike a note of caution, echoing previous debates on labour control: there is 
disagreement over whether the ability to collect such performance data necessarily means 
that managers always refer to, or act on, the data; whether technologies are actually capa-
ble of living up to their claimed surveillance potential; and to what extent employees can 
resist such techniques, rationalise their existence, or even turn them to their own advantage.58 
The conditional and partial nature of the potential for control within ICT is illustrated in 
a number of workplace studies, such as Eriksson-Zetterquist et al.’s work on the introduc-
tion of new technology into professional jobs and Fisher’s research into the introduction 
of ICTs and the restructuring of work within an agency of the UK civil service. Fisher, for 
example, shows how the complexity of the case work undertaken by the civil servants largely 
thwarted management attempts to de-skill the work technically and to exert more control 
over it, although managers were nevertheless able to use the new ICT systems to generate 
previously unavailable information about the work process that might assist future attempts 
to exert greater control.59
Further, in particular organisational contexts, some workers may also view surveillance 
as legitimate in proving their own levels of performance against allegedly less productive col-
leagues, as Sewell et al. find in a call centre,60 or protecting their safety, as Grampp et al. find 
with the introduction of global positioning systems (GPS) for dispatch of taxi drivers in Dub-
lin. GPS facilitated closer management control over the movements of drivers and limited their 
autonomy. Drivers were resigned to this rather than resistant: inasmuch as the system reduced 
the time that taxis were unoccupied, it also maximised driver income and, in many respects, 
the interests of company and drivers coincided. However, what really sold GPS to the drivers, 
and was emphasised by employer and equipment suppliers alike, was the potential to improve 
driver safety.61 This study, and others like it, shows that we cannot conceive of organisational 
control as simple or unproblematic, and it is clearly mediated by other salient issues within 
the workplace.
Computer use and organisational policies
The generic nature of the software included on organisational networks and computing 
devices creates novel problems and dilemmas for managers about the control of employees’ 
computer use in working hours. Access to the Internet, social networking sites and email is 
increasingly available within the workplace, and further applications similar to those already 
likely to be on employees’ home computers and smartphones. This raises real problems about 
the boundaries between ‘work’ and ‘personal’ use of computers, what usage workers may 
legitimately make of the computing facilities available to them and how any restrictions 
should be devised, monitored and enforced. The extended hours that some employees spend 
at, or doing, work clearly exacerbate the likelihood that the employer’s computing facilities 
may be the vehicle used for personal or social Internet traffic.62

 A growing number of disciplinary, dismissal and Employment Tribunal (ET) cases have 
centred on the abuse of email, distribution of inappropriate images and negative posts by 
employees on social media. 63 ETs have ruled that employees were fairly dismissed even if the 
posts were not primarily work related, distribution was only to a small group of ‘Facebook 
friends’ or ‘Twitter followers’, or the employer was not mentioned by name. In cases where 
the employee won, ETs sometimes reduced compensation on the grounds that, by posting in 
a public forum, the employee contributed to the problem. 64 Even if used for work purposes, 
email can be used excessively or distributed to mailing lists beyond those who need to – or, in 
some cases, should – see the message concerned, thus contributing to information overload. 
 As both a legal defence and good HRM policy, organisations should therefore put in place 
clear and transparent guidelines to minimise the likelihood of abuse or misunderstandings 
about the nature and extent of computer use for reasons that may be considered unrelated 
to work. A number of such guidelines exist, including those produced by organisations such 
as ACAS and the CIPD. 65  These cover issues of access to computer systems, monitoring of 
employee usage, the degree to which personal use of computing facilities may be permissible 
in work time, data protection, use of disclaimers in emails to safeguard against legal action, 
the relative responsibilities of employers and employees, and so on. 
 Surveys of both UK and US employers by XpertHR fi nd that most of the respondents 
do indeed have policies, some of which permit a certain level of non-work use of email and 
the Internet by staff  for activities such as online shopping, but are less likely to permit online 
gambling, and all the policies surveyed prohibited accessing pornography. 66 Relatively minor 
transgressions by employees of such usage policies are also reported to be common. New tech-
nological developments, such as social networking, carry with them the need for organisational 
policies to be regularly updated if they are to remain relevant.  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 The use of icT as a means of increased managerial surveillance should be strictly limited by serious concerns for the 
social and ethical issues that arise from monitoring workers’ activities and performance. 
 How far do YOU believe ICT can justifiably be used as a means of surveillance in the workplace? What social or ethi-
cal issues do YOU think are relevant? 
 
 Management and organisational behaviour in action case study 
 Negotiating the use of vehicle-tracking technology 
 The use of vehicle-tracking technology by managers of those who drive company vehicles as part of their job has 
resulted in a number of disputes between fi rms and trade unions about the monitoring of drivers. among other 
things, drivers and their unions have been concerned about privacy and the possible use of such systems to moni-
tor driver location and performance. For management’s part, such workers have traditionally been very diffi  cult to 
control, as they often work alone and cannot be readily supervised when off  the company premises. 
 in 2009 British Telecom (BT) engineers in southampton belonging to the communication Workers’ Union (cWU) 
organised a demonstration about the proposed installation of gPs vehicle-tracking systems in their vehicle cabs. 
in response to this disquiet, BT managers entered discussions with cWU representatives and the outcome was a 
jointly negotiated Memorandum of Understanding that stipulated how gPs equipment was to be used in the future. 
The agreement stated that the system would not be used as a means of engaging in surveillance of employees, nor 
would it be used as the sole basis for opening disciplinary proceedings against, or questioning the performance 
of, individuals. The agreement reached also gave guarantees about employees’ reasonable expectations of privacy

 Social networking 
 We have discussed the vertical control that employers can exercise over workers’ tasks through 
ICT, and their ability to monitor the use that employees are making of the technologies that 
are made available to them. Social networking and other interactive technologies, such as Face-
book, Twitter, virtual worlds (such as Second Life), weblogs (blogs), etc., permit the more 
lateral use of technologies to share information and digital content. Social networking sites 
such as Facebook have tens of millions of users, mostly in their teens and 20s, many of whom 
are currently part of the workforce and many more who soon will be. 
 Such developments create new problems for traditional authority relations and communi-
cations within organisations as these interactive technologies short-circuit existing organisa-
tional hierarchies. 67 Online social networking has increased rapidly, and at least some of this 
must be taking place in work time. One response is to clamp down. Fears that employees’ pro-
ductivity is declining through ‘wasting’ time on these kinds of allegedly unproductive activi-
ties have led a considerable number of employers to limit time spent on networking sites or to 
forbid such activities altogether. 68 Apart from social media’s potential for new work-related 
misbehaviours, employers are also concerned about reputational damage. For example, cases 
exist of blogging employees being dismissed when the off ending employer about whom they 
were blogging could be identifi ed from details included in the posts. 69 
 Others argue that organisations should come to terms with the new participatory oppor-
tunities off ered by social media and should not ‘kill the conversation’. 70 Social networking can 
be a positive phenomenon for recruitment, publicity, to build necessary business contacts and 
to expand sales and goodwill beyond organisational boundaries. ACAS argues it can be used 
to strengthen employee voice. 71 In relation to blogging, for example,  Ellis and Richards dispute 
the common perception that it is solely a manifestation of covert resistance to the employer. 
Their research with bloggers fi nds that other motivations for blogging include using it as an 
outlet for workers’ underemployed creativity, to build a virtual network of the like-minded 
and as a form of public relations for the job. This raises the worrying possibility that such 
employees are fi nding a form of autonomy and control in their blogs that they do not feel in 
their everyday jobs. 72  
 Using networking sites for business communications and marketing purposes appears to 
be considered important in some fi rms, particularly those in creative industries and those 
while out on the road and committed BT management and the cWU to consulting jointly in order to engage trust. 
as a result of the agreement, BT line managers were forbidden from accessing the gPs to view data in real time on 
tracked vehicle movements. This does not imply that they cannot access historical data. 
 as a result of this agreement, a potentially serious dispute was averted and relations between the company and 
the cWU appear to have been strengthened.

whose business methods have traditionally relied heavily on more established forms of social 
networking. 73 While the more well-known sites such as Facebook tend to be used predomi-
nantly for social purposes, there exist other networks, such as LinkedIn, that are primarily 
intended for business use by professionals. 74 As with most electronic technologies, network-
ing appears equally capable of being used for work and social purposes, thus one cannot 
draw blanket conclusions that such developments bode well or ill from a work perspective. 
 Bradwell and Reeves 75 argue that any distinction between ‘social’ and ‘professional’ net-
working is becoming increasingly artifi cial, especially in relation to younger employees, and 
that the latter type of network is spreading its boundaries horizontally across organisations. 
Although they argue that such developments have considerable promise, dangers can be 
identifi ed too. 
 Potential dangers and drawbacks 
 The development of individual workers’ networks with those outside the organisation raises 
questions about the nature of commercial confi dentiality, of loyalty, and also conceals dangers 
of iniquitous practices in hiring staff , awarding contracts, and suchlike. Others have indicated 
further drawbacks with networks, although some of these disadvantages accrue to diff erent 
parties in the employment relationship. Firstly, one needs to question whether the forms of 
social interaction enabled by such sites are as rich in quality as traditional face-to-face net-
working, 76 considered further in the section on social interactions below. 
 Secondly, employees may easily forget that the electronic traces they leave on the Web and 
networking sites can be accessed by anyone who is able to track them down, including curious 
prospective future employers! Finally, employees may equally be able to use electronic net-
works against the interests of employers, as  Pliskin et al. demonstrate in their study of how 
Israeli university lecturers created a successful email network to distribute information about, 
and maintain solidarity in, a pay dispute with their employers. 77 The uses of ICTs for organis-
ing protest are considered further in the next section. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 a manager who tries to ban the use of social media sites in the workplace is like King canute trying to turn back the 
tides. 
 To what extent do YOU agree? What restrictions, if any, do YOU believe managers should put on the use of social 
media sites at work, and why? 
 Changing relations with customers and users 
 As the previous section suggested, current Internet developments blur the boundaries between 
the organisation and its external context in ways previously not experienced. This section 
considers three aspects of how such technologies impact on organisations’ relations with their 
customers or service users. These are the implications for organisation structure and work of 
user-generated content and ‘crowd-sourcing’; the use of technology to enable customer self-
service; and organisations’ increasing transparency and vulnerability to the views and opin-
ions of external customers and service users. 
 Interactive technologies have increased the power of the user of products and services. One 
sees this, fi rstly, in user-generated content on Internet sites, such as in amateur reviews of 
products and services purchased. Organisations have little or no control over such content. 
Secondly, a more far-reaching development is the ‘open-source’ or ‘crowd-sourcing’ movement, 

Chapter 12 Technology and organisaTions
453
where enthusiastic amateurs, often working unpaid, engage in dispersed ‘mass collaboration’ 
to author, develop and improve artefacts. 78 
 Computer operating systems such as Linux, software (‘freeware’) such as Audacity and 
the online encyclopedia Wikipedia are among the better-known products of this movement. 
Torch-bearers for this movement, such as  Shirky, consider it as ‘organising without organisa-
tions’. 79   Pessimists interpret manifestations of crowd-sourcing such as Amazon’s ‘Mechanical 
Turk’ as a further step on the road to casualised, insecure and poorly paid self-employment. 80 
Such developments in mass co-operation have implications for traditional organisation struc-
tures, the distribution of power, the nature and value of professional expertise, and even the 
nature and value of paid work itself that are as yet in their infancy. The likely implications are 
as yet imperfectly understood and require further research. 
 A second trend enabled by increasingly interactive technologies is the transfer of what used 
to be paid work to the free labour of the customer or service user. Although a move from paid 
service to self-service has been visible for some time – think of the use of ATMs by banks over 
several decades – the Internet and user-friendly software have taken this to a new level. Self-
service supermarket checkouts, online-only ordering (e.g. fl ight booking for certain budget 
airlines) and the development of so-called e-government services 81 provide examples of this. 
Such innovations change the relationship between the organisation and the customer/user. 
 Thirdly, interactive technologies have changed the dynamics of organisational power, not 
only internally within the organisation (as suggested in the previous section), but also in rela-
tion to interactions with customers, users and the wider public. This can happen in several 
ways. The perceived performance of workers in organisations can become more transparent 
to current and prospective customers. For instance, crowd-sourced taxi drivers for the smart-
phone-powered UberTaxi service are rated by customers according to the service they give. 
The visibility of drivers’ ratings to potential customers acts as a powerful disciplinary force on 
the drivers concerned if they wish to continue receiving jobs. 
 The new social media provide further opportunities for reputational impacts on organisa-
tions and the organisation of protest and dissent.  Butler argues that: ‘Web technology has 
changed the relationship between authority, employee and citizen. In the past, it was relatively 
easy for public authorities to control the “authorised” version of events.’ 82 Writers dispute 
the importance of the Internet and social media such as Facebook and Twitter as vehicles for 
activism.  Mason argues that they have been signifi cant, while  Gladwell suggests that they are 
overrated, encouraging a relatively weak form of remote activism. 83 Nevertheless, such media 
have been used to co-ordinate campaigns against employment, environmental and other cor-
porate policies of fi rms of all sizes, and the potential for reputational damage to organisations 
is clear. 84  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 Publicly available online reviews of organisational performance provide the only quick and effective way for pro-
spective customers to judge the likely quality of that organisation’s employees in serving the customer’s needs. 
 On balance, how valid do YOU think such forms of feedback are? Put together YOUR list of possible arguments in 
favour of, and opposing, this statement. 
 Location of work 
 New technologies have facilitated the redistribution of where work is carried out in a number 
of ways, the full implications of which are not yet clear. Here we focus on two main devel-
opments. Firstly, the availability of ICTs has made the displacement of workers from the 

454
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
traditional individual location (desk or office) considerably easier. Thus workers may be work-
ing from home, on the move, or in some form of collective office space part or all of the time. 
Secondly, technology has made easier the move nationally or even internationally of certain 
forms of service sector activity that can be carried out over the telephone or via an Internet 
connection. This is one part of the phenomenon known as offshoring. In each of these cases, 
technology is certainly not the only factor in play, but it is an important one.
Remote and mobile working
The fragmentation of the ‘workplace’ is a multifaceted phenomenon, and some aspects are 
discussed elsewhere in this text (see, for example, telecommuting in Chapter 11). Here we 
concentrate more specifically on the trends towards working while on the move. Sociologists 
such as Urry have noted the simultaneous expansion in recent years of human travel and of 
the desire to maintain contact with other people at a distance through various communication 
technologies.85 Such developments have expanded into the world of work in a variety of forms. 
Sixty-four per cent of the firms responding to a 2011 survey by Virgin Media Business claim to 
be equipping workers to work out of the office, a rapid growth that suggests that the relative 
positions of mobile and fixed desktop computing are gradually being reversed.86
Felstead et al. have conducted perhaps the most comprehensive study to date of workers 
whose jobs are located wholly or partly away from a conventional workplace. Felstead et al. 
detail the many ways in which traditional conceptions and routines of work are fragmented 
and displaced in such settings, but the most instructive lesson is that workers actively attempt 
to reconstruct for themselves some of the certainties of the traditional workplace, although 
sometimes in new ways. These include attempts to reconstruct ‘personal’ work space and a divi-
sion between ‘working’ and ‘non-working’ time. Workers also invent new ways to circumvent 
the electronic supervision of their activities (as discussed above) and to alert their superiors to 
their ‘presence’ and productivity, by sending emails very early or late in the day, for example.87
Globalisation and offshoring
Certainly, we can say that economic factors are important too,88 including the emergence as 
economic powers of new nations with skilled but relatively inexpensive workforces. This has 
created new options for organisations about where to locate the functions that need to be per-
formed, but also numerous dilemmas concerned with co-ordination of the business and both 
political and customer reaction.
The development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is, along with dereg-
ulation, the other key enabling factor for the changed nature of globalisation. It enables 
both a closer coordination of supply chain activities and more cost-efficient delivery across 
national borders. The other important implication of technological advances in ICT is that it 
has eroded some of the geographical limitations to the provision of services and opened up a 
wide range of service activities to international competition that were previously confined to 
national markets.89
As this quote suggests, it is clear that the development of broadband and the falling costs of 
computing and telephony are among the main reasons for the trend to export service jobs 
from the West to new parts of the world. ICTs are one of the main drivers of the globalisation 
of organisations and work, contributing to the wider fragmentation of organisational forms 
and structures in the process.90
Employment, social and organisational implications
Much of the debate about offshoring has been concerned with the employment, social and 
organisational implications of what the new technological possibilities unleash. The initial 
concern was with the impact on service sector work that is not – or can be reorganised so as 

Chapter 12 Technology and organisaTions
455
not to be – performed face to face, especially in fi nance, insurance and other customer-service 
operations. Early public debate focused on the export from Western countries of such work 
and its concentration into telephone call centres in countries such as India, which have a highly 
qualifi ed and plentiful supply of English-speaking labour and a developing technical infra-
structure. Nevertheless, such workers are paid a fraction of the wages that comparable work 
in the UK would attract, although the wages in the recipient country may still seem high by its 
average standards and the relative ‘wage gap’ between the ‘sender’ and ‘receiver’ countries has 
declined over time. Research suggests that fi rms involved in off shored work tend to reorganise 
it along Taylorised lines, giving the workers limited discretion and subjecting them to a high 
degree of monitoring. 91 Similarly, Internet-based commercial activities can be based where the 
labour needed to run and maintain them is relatively cheap. 
 More recently, higher-value and professional activities have been considered candidates for 
off shoring, and a number of off shore service providers off er, for example, staff  planning and 
other HR services, programming and software development, and so on.  Garner classifi es the 
types of service jobs that are economically attractive to move abroad as those that do not 
require the provider to be in physical contact with the recipient and are labour intensive, infor-
mation based, codifi able (i.e. routinised) and highly transparent (involve dealing with easily 
measurable and verifi able information, such as the analysis of fi nancial ratios). 92 
 the future of off shoring 
 Indications are that off shoring is continuing to expand, despite a hiatus in the global reces-
sion. Despite its public profi le and the predictions of off shoring’s optimists, 93 a number of 
commentators have argued that its extent and impact has been exaggerated. Numerous inter-
national commentators 94 have argued that – with some exceptions – the proportion of jobs 
off shored from the developed West has been relatively low, although views diff er about likely 
future changes. 95   Some have pointed to problems that have emerged, including a retreat from 
off shoring by some organisations due to political or customer pressure. Strains have emerged 
in the countries that have benefi ted disproportionately from off shoring, such as India. Some 
researchers have found that call-centre work is plagued by high levels of staff  turnover. Also, 
the very success of countries such as India in attracting off shored work has led to a tightening 
of the labour market and wage infl ation, which has given an incentive to relocate such work 
again to relatively cheaper regions or even to other countries. 96 For students of organisational 
behaviour, such events clearly demonstrate the often unintended consequences of the use of 
technical possibilities to restructure and relocate work processes within fi rms. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 icTs have helped to enable the globalisation and ‘offshoring’ of certain types of work from the West to other parts 
of the world. 
 How important do YOU believe technology is compared with other possible causes? Do YOU think this kind of ‘out-
sourcing’ arguably causes more problems than benefits for organisations? 
 the nature of social interactions 
 Technology is likely to change the extent and manner in which managers and workers interact 
and workers interact with each other. It may aff ect the size and nature of work groups and the 
extent of physical mobility and of contacts with other people. These factors will certainly be 
magnifi ed with ICTs, where people working on linked tasks may be at a variety of locations, 

456
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
including at home (as discussed, for example, in the section on telecommuting in Chapter 11), 
and individuals may work more on their own, from personal workstations, or work more with 
machines than with other people. There are clear dangers for organisations here that workers 
may become isolated from the workplace and that it becomes harder for the informal channels 
of information exchange on which organisations depend to flow freely.
Worse, information about developing problems can be more easily hidden when workers 
are not interacting face to face. A comment from a knowledge management worker participat-
ing in a research study of virtual working sums up the difficulty of creating high-quality social 
interactions when workers are communicating from different locations: ‘We try to have what 
we call virtual coffee sessions, which were dreadful . . . all around the world we tried to get 
together and have a cup of coffee and sit down and look at each other, and you can’t be spon-
taneous now, you can’t do it, you can’t force it.’97
Remote versus office-based workers
It is well established that remote workers face particular problems in being able to interact suc-
cessfully with the organisation, and particular care is needed to integrate them and to assure 
that they face no detriment to their career development. Equally important, but subject to 
considerably less attention, is the quality and nature of interaction between staff who remain 
office based and their remote co-workers. The limited research that does exist suggests that 
office workers can resent their remote colleagues, both for the perceived advantages of the 
remote lifestyle and for the fact that their own presence in the office means they pick up tasks 
that the remote workers can avoid. Golden studied the job satisfaction and turnover intentions 
of office-based workers who have colleagues who telework.98 He found that ‘the prevalence of 
teleworkers in a work unit alters the flexibility and workload of non-teleworking colleagues, 
thereby impacting their satisfaction with co-workers and turnover intentions’.99 Such nega-
tive findings for co-workers of teleworking are moderated the fewer the hours teleworked, 
the greater the opportunity for face-to-face interactions with teleworkers and the greater the 
degree of job autonomy experienced.
Fogarty et al. studied predominantly office-based workers in a publishing firm where some 
staff work remotely on an informal basis, alongside the existence of other employees on a for-
mal teleworking scheme and yet others who always work in the office. Their findings question 
the practicalities of the ‘virtual organisation’. They found that communications and social 
interactions between office-based and remote workers, as well as continuity of operations, can 
all be adversely affected by the uncertainties generated, especially by the practice of ad hoc 
informal off-site working.100
The pace and intensity of work
Considerable evidence now exists that modern work patterns are becoming more intensive and 
although organisational change more generally is one of the main causes of this, it is exacer-
bated by accompanying technical changes and the way in which technology is often utilised 
within organisations.101 Technology can dictate the speed at which workers react and affect the 
pace and intensity of work, such as in the mechanical pacing of work on a mass-­production 
assembly line or the manner in which electronic control devices can be programmed to demand 
a human response within a given time frame. If such demands are perceived as excessively fre-
quent, persistent or intrusive, then this may result in the development of stress.
The introduction of ICT undoubtedly transforms, significantly, the nature of work and 
employment conditions for staff. The instantaneous connectivity of new technologies, notably 
email and instant messaging, has created a working climate in which there is a greater expec-
tation of the immediacy of receipt and response, regardless of location or time, and this has 
added to the dangers of information overload. The ease of use only exacerbates the frequency 

Chapter 12  Technology and organisations
457
of use. The lack of deliberation encouraged by this expectation of rapid response then gener-
ates further traffic to clarify previous communications. The danger is magnified by the ability 
to send a message to whole groups of people (whether warranted or not). Symon points out 
that the volume of information leads workers to develop strategies to ignore much of it, which 
is itself problematic if significant information is thus screened out.102
Views on ICT’s contribution to workers’ stress and impact on work/life balance are split 
into three broad categories. The more negative research finds that the ever-increasing use of 
ICT, and workers’ propensity to check for messages repeatedly (with or without managerial 
expectations they will do so), are causes of rising stress levels in the workplace.103 Conversely, 
others argue that fears of increasing user stress are exaggerated and that users – especially 
those who have grown up with ICT – can develop coping mechanisms to process and retrieve 
information without experiencing overload.104 A third view, typified by Madden and Jones’ 
PEW/Internet and American Life Project, suggests a more mixed, nuanced picture, where 
ICT’s contribution to workers’ productivity and flexibility is offset by difficulties in disengag-
ing from an intensified work experience.105
We referred earlier to the increase in use of ICT for the purposes of monitoring workers, 
especially as uncovered by the longitudinal survey comparisons of McGovern et al.106 These 
authors also demonstrate, as a relatively novel trend in the workplace, that ICT is associated 
with an observable increase in the levels of strain felt by workers, even when the technology is 
only used to record the work done. The degree of work strain tends to increase for administra-
tive and semi-skilled employees when ICT is used as a means of checking work performance 
(but apparently not in the case of professional and managerial workers, although such use of 
ICT may well be less widespread here).107
A number of major European employers are now beginning to introduce organisational 
solutions to reduce the impact of ICT overload on staff. These include preventing the firm’s 
servers from sending out email after the end of shifts, banning managers from contacting 
employees outside working hours and allowing staff to delete email sent to them while they 
are on leave.108
The ‘digital divide’ and job security
Finally, we consider the implications of technology, particularly ICTs, for exacerbating the 
divisions that exist, both within and outside of the organisation, between those with high lev-
els of technical knowledge and skills and those without. This phenomenon of differing levels 
of technical literacy within the workforce and, indeed, within the population more widely, is 
often referred to as the ‘digital divide’.
One of the most repetitive themes in debates about technology and organisations is auto-
mation’s impact on jobs.109 At the dawn of the microprocessor revolution in the late 1970s, 
Jenkins and Sherman famously predicted ‘the collapse of work’.110 In fact, new products, ser-
vices and jobs arose to soak up any technological unemployment. In parallel to this, numerous 
researchers noted the growth of digital divides within and between countries, where those 
with the capacity to utilise new technologies fared better than the less technically skilled.111 
In the West, the latter group tended to stay in work if their jobs remained too cheap to be 
worth exporting or could not realistically be automated at all.112
Recently, however, writers such as Brynjolfsson and McAfee and Frey and Osborne have 
analysed the US labour market and again forecast the possibility of large-scale job losses. 
Frey and Osborne argue that 47 per cent of US jobs are at high risk from computerisation, 19 
per cent at medium risk and the remaining third at low risk, under current conditions of low 
growth and high levels of inequality. As before, low-skilled jobs are at the greatest risk, but 
they suggest that the next generation of technologies, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, 
drones, etc., will also threaten more highly skilled and professional jobs.113 It remains to be 
seen whether matters will turn out in the apocalyptic way predicted, although an increasing 

458
part 4 sTrUcTUre, sTraTegy and eFFecTiVeness
digital divide, with its divergent implications for skills, wages and job security, is a reason-
able bet. However, our argument in this chapter is that developments depend strongly on the 
unpredictable processes by which technologies are introduced and used in organisations. 
 Implications for organisations and 
organisational behaviour 
 What are the implications for organisations and organisational behaviour? If this kind of 
polarisation is happening, it has obvious ramifi cations for skills, training and promotion, 
recruitment patterns and business strategies more generally. Clearly, there is an onus on man-
agers to guide the process of technical change so that the more deleterious implications for 
job security and skills apparent in the scenario above are avoided, as far as possible. It is also 
important that managers do not stereotype the presumed abilities with ICTs of particular 
groups of workers, such as older employees. Nonetheless, it seems likely that those working 
in modern organisations might well have very diff erent reactions to IT developments and use 
IT in diff erent ways. For some, new systems and applications might be welcome as a means 
of becoming more eff ective; for others, perhaps those with less experience of IT, new systems 
might be viewed as threatening. While there might be fewer and fewer individuals in this latter 
category, their anxiety is likely to be very real as the ever-rising tide of technological possibili-
ties washes over them. 
 For yet others, technological developments might be welcome, but their ability to make the 
most of what is on off er can be compromised by lack of time to learn about new systems or 
the lack of appropriate training. However, research suggests that there is also likely to be a 
fourth group, mostly younger workers, whose technological expertise is very sophisticated and 
who might fi nd organisational systems archaic, frustrating and slow by comparison with those 
they encounter in their personal lives. 114  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 To make the best use of technology we must use it to support and develop the effectiveness of organisations, and 
not be tempted to adapt business activities to the technology. The tail must not be allowed to wag the dog. 
 Do YOU think technology is becoming too much our master rather than our servant? How would YOU go about mak-
ing the best use of technology? 
 ten key points to remember 
  1  Technology is increasingly pervasive and ﬂ exible in organisations. human factors are important 
in successful technical change, and problems can result if they are underestimated or ignored. 
  2  There is continuing debate about diff erent approaches to technology and organisations and 
the extent to which it consists of ‘social’ as well as ‘purely’ technical factors. 
  3  The introduction of technology into organisations involves a number of phases and stages. 
There can be considerable organisational choice over the use of technology.

gap and how might it be prevented? 
  3  What objectives should managers set for the introduction of technological change? draw upon case study

  4  To what extent do you agree with the contention that ‘decision-making with respect to technical change is an 
inherently political process’?

to the supervision of employees.’ discuss. 
  6  discuss the contention that a theoretical or practical perspective that sees technology as having independent

  7  compare the possible advantages and disadvantages of remote working from the perspectives of (a) mobile 
workers  and (b) offi  ce-based workers. 
  8  in what ways can icT lead to the intensifi cation of work? To what extent do you think that such developments 
are inevitable? 
  9  how useful do you believe is Foucault’s ‘panopticon’ metaphor for understanding the surveillance potential of 
icTs? 
  10  critically consider what, if any,  new  issues social media and social networking raise for the study of technology 
and organisational behaviour. 
 Review and discussion questions 
  4  human factors tend to be considered at the later stages of the process. an important issue is 
the extent of early involvement of hr specialists and the extent to which the quality of deci-
sion-making is likely to be improved. 
  5   considerable debate exists about the interactions between technology and organisational 
behaviour and the impact of technology change on workers’ skill, work design and job quality. 
  6   current technological innovations have increasing potential to gather data that can be used to 
control workers’ behaviour and performance. actual use depends on managerial policies and 
balance of power between managers and workers. 
  7   collaborative networking, internet and social media technologies present new opportunities 
and problems for organisations in their internal relations with workers and external relations 
with customers and users. 
  8   Technology is increasingly aff ecting where work is carried out and blurring the division between 
home, travel and work, and also between work and social life. 
  9   The above technological developments are contributing to an increased pace and inten-
sity of work, yet workers seem willing to trade off  such disadvantages in return for greater 
connectedness. 
  10   research indicates a ‘digital divide’ between the unequal job opportunities and security avail-
able to workers with high levels of technical skill versus those without.

 Assignment 
 For your university, or an organisation with which you are familiar, you are required to: 
 1  detail fully an example of technical change that has taken place or is taking place, comparing the work processes 
involved and how they are carried out, both  before and  after the change 
 2  analyse the origins and development of that change, drawing upon the technological and organisational change 
literatures discussed in this text. 
 3  assess the main implications of that change for both the organisation and its employees. For example, what 
have been the eff ects on job numbers, the nature of the work required, skill levels, training requirements; has the 
change solved the problems it was intended to address, or has it thrown up new issues; what have been the main 
costs and benefi ts? 
 Objectives 
 completing this exercise should help you to enhance the following skills: 
 ●  Understand better the impact of technology on an organisation and its members. 
 ●  apply your theoretical knowledge to the analysis of organisational processes. 
 ●  evaluate benefi ts and drawbacks resulting from technological change. 
 Exercise 
 select and examine examples of two diff erent jobs in your university, if possible, or in some other organisation with 
which you are familiar. detail the main duties of the chosen jobs and both the technical skill and equipment neces-
sary in undertaking each job. 
 Taking each job in turn, detail: 
 ●  Those aspects of the job that you think could, or should, be further automated, and why? 
 ●  Those aspects of the job that cannot, or should not, be further automated, and why? 
 ●  how the nature of the job would change if your suggestions were followed. What do you think would be the reac-
tion of the occupant? Would the job become more or less fulfi lling? 
 ●   To what extent do you think senior managers would come to the same conclusions as yourself, taking into account 
factors such as costs, product and service quality? 
 Discussion 
 ●  To what extent does theorising on the nature of technology help in analysing applications of technological 
change? 
 ●  on the basis of the jobs you have studied, does it suggest that further automation results in more positive or more 
negative implications for individuals in an organisation? Would you come to the same conclusion about further 
automation in general? 
 ●   Think back to the present occupants of each job. in what ways do you think there might be a diff erent response 
depending upon the generation and age group of the occupants  (discussed in  Chapter  3 ) (e.g. generation y) 
and the technological sophistication of the occupants?

Chapter 12  Technology and organisations
461
Few aspects of working life today remain untouched 
by technological change, and academia is no excep-
tion. The last ten years have seen rapid changes in 
the way that higher-education establishments oper-
ate, and student expectations are now conditioned by 
familiarity with social media technology (SMT) such 
as Facebook. This creates pressure for universities and 
colleges to adopt IT-based platforms for the manage-
ment and delivery of study programmes; for instance, 
students expect many practical aspects of life – class and 
examination timetables, module choices, achievement 
records and so forth – to be online.
The adoption of proprietary web-based teaching 
tools or ‘virtual learning environments’ (VLEs) such as 
Blackboard and Moodle allow many teaching activi-
ties to be transferred to cyberspace, and have become 
almost universal accessories to taught programmes 
(‘blended learning’). VLEs also support distance-learning 
courses: online materials, recorded lectures and real-
time seminars (webinars) replicate traditional methods 
and can facilitate remote access to some of the best 
teaching in the world.
Assessment is another area where technology can 
support course delivery, and it is one that is proving 
somewhat contentious. Most universities have well-
developed policies and procedures about assessment. 
These relate to the need for fairness, objectivity, speed 
and quality, yet student surveys have revealed that 
assessment and feedback on performance are areas 
where there is persistent dissatisfaction.115 Why should 
this be the case? And can technology help? The experi-
ence of one UK institution can help us to understand the 
organisational benefits and people-related challenges 
associated with introducing a system for the electronic 
management of assessment (EMA).
Assessment and feedback
The assessment of student work and feedback on results 
is one of the most angst-ridden areas of academic life for 
students and teachers alike. To understand why, we need 
to separate out the components of this problem area.
There are two main types of assessment: formative 
and summative. Formative assessment has the main 
purpose of helping students to gauge their progress and 
identify mistakes or areas for improvement.116 Summative 
assessment is intended to judge learning, and results in 
formal marks that will contribute to a student’s individ-
ual grade. Feedback can mean simply the publication of 
results (‘getting your mark back’), or it can mean receiv-
ing qualitative analysis of the assessed work and guid-
ance for improvement. Arguably, qualitative feedback 
on formative assessment is less contentious and more 
valuable because it does not affect a formal grade. It is 
when handling summative assessment and feedback that 
things get tricky. Again, two distinct problems arise: the 
speed with which results arrive and the result itself. If you 
have worked hard on an essay or slogged through exams, 
you will want to know how you did as soon as possible. 
But you would also want to think that your work had 
been carefully and fairly marked, and that you can learn 
from any mistakes. You might also want to know that any 
of your peers who have cheated by copying or plagiaris-
ing have been duly detected and penalised. The tension 
between these two expectations – a quick response and 
high-quality marking and feedback – often causes prob-
lems for academic institutions. Teaching and administra-
tive staff are faced with large peaks of work at submission 
and examination time that then has to be processed 
securely, fairly and accurately. EMA is designed to help, 
and a study at the University of Huddersfield shows the 
impact technology can make.117
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the intro-
duction of a Turnitin-based electronic assessment man-
agement system118 over six years between 2007 and 
2012. During this time different cohorts of students 
were included in the project (starting with first-year

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
students in 2007–8) and different elements of electronic 
management were introduced stage by stage (remov-
ing the need for paper assignment submissions, add-
ing new types of marking tool and enabling methods to 
store and handle cohort marks). Four main groups were 
affected by the project:
● students whose work was included;
● administrative staff who handle assessments and 
records;
● academics who mark and give feedback;
● managers who are concerned with costs and ben-
efits of EMA.
Unsurprisingly, students were ultimately much happier 
with EMA than with traditional methods of submitting 
assignments:
Amongst students, there is very strong evidence 
to suggest that not only is electronic assessment 
management their preference, but that those who 
come to appreciate its attendant benefits then begin to 
see . . . [it] . . . as their entitlement.119
This is not to say that there were no initial anxieties or 
that all students preferred electronic submission, but 
experience showed it to be easy, much like uploading a 
photo on Facebook. It was seen as removing the anxiety 
of printing close to submission deadlines, travelling to 
the administrative centre and queuing to hand in. There 
was also evidence that students had great confidence in 
the security of electronic submission, particularly as the 
system generated a timed receipt:
it’s that security of knowing that you’ve got something 
that says you’ve submitted it at this time so nobody can 
come back and say your work’s missing, you can say 
I’ve got this proof.120
There was also general satisfaction with the electronic 
feedback and marker comments, not least of which 
being that they were legible!
Administrators were also generally content with a 
system that reduced mindless, repetitive tasks such as 
date-stamping and logging paperwork. There were time 
savings and an apparent increase in job satisfaction as 
they were able to devote more energy to helping stu-
dents and academic colleagues.
Early adopters, healthy sceptics,  
reluctant users
As the study notes, the group most significantly affected 
by the use of EMA systems was that of academic staff 
and teachers. The research noted three distinct groups 
with respect to EMA:
Amongst academic staff attitudes are split into three 
main groups: those who are innovators or early adopters 
and have migrated enthusiastically to eMarking, those 
who have approached it more cautiously and those 
who have done so reluctantly or have tried it and then 
moved back to paper marking.121
Early adopters were those who had generally chosen 
to use eMarking as soon as it became available and are 
seen as important for any future developments:
while this is the group of staff that are the least likely 
to be disgruntled, it is vital that any EAM122 system 
that is adopted allows them to continue working in the 
ways they prefer and ideal that it also be a system that 
rewards them for doing so.123
Healthy sceptics began by being neutral regarding the 
use of EMA. Not as enthusiastic as early adopters, they 
would not use a system that did not work better than 
the more traditional one.
This group are characterised by not being prepared to 
tolerate interfaces with which or environments in which 
they were not comfortable or which felt unnecessarily 
difficult or cumbersome to use. They have, however, 
been persuaded to convert to eMarking either because 
of the benefits experienced by their colleagues, or 
because of other demonstrable benefits.124
Some of the benefits reported included better organisa-
tion of marking, not having to carry around mounds of 
paper that might get lost or muddled and easier detec-
tion of copying, plagiarism and other sorts of cheating 
that can be facilitated by EMA. The study notes that 
this group is particularly important as it can provide the 
critical mass that would enable an institution’s manag-
ers to implement EMA successfully. The University of 
Huddersfield authors also suggest that the early adop-
ters would be best placed to act as change agents and 
be more effective coaches to healthy sceptics in the use 
of eMarking than administrative or technology support 
staff.
Finally, the reluctant users are those for whom EMA 
is both problematic from a practical point of view and 
seems to challenge the values of personal interaction 
and ‘old school’ teaching.
Practical problems include the inability to mark 
assignments wherever they wanted to, for example on 
train journeys or in places without Internet connections. 
Additionally there was concern about the amount of 
time that would have to be spent in front of a computer 
screen reading and typing. Engaging reluctant users 
would thus be difficult. Two points on the topic in the 
Huddersfield report are worth noting:

Chapter 12  Technology and organisations
463
One participant admitted to using his seniority to force 
more junior colleagues to use the tool, which suggests 
that this may be a relatively effective way of generating 
widespread take-up, especially across junior and part-
time staff who have little option to refuse the directives 
of their more senior module leaders.125
and:
One participant reported that a colleague was 
forced into it by student complaints which were 
communicated at a student panel. He was the last 
academic staff member in his particular discipline 
area still marking on paper and this participant 
reported that the students demanded he start marking 
electronically.126
In any university or college the relationship between 
students, managers, administrators and academic staff is 
likely to be profoundly affected by the adoption of EMA 
systems. The experiences, attitudes and priorities of all 
four groups will be different, and managers of academic 
institutions are likely to be grappling with them even 
as you are reading this case; you could be shaping the 
future of higher education right now.

 criticisms of control are totally misplaced. although they may not always openly admit it, most members of staff 
want to know exactly what is expected of them, be given clear lines of direction and regular review and feedback on 
their performance. This is the essence of control. 
 How would YOU attempt to present a counterargument? To what extent do YOU welcome control over YOUR work 
performance? 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 an underlying feature of organisational behaviour is the concept 
of control and power. control systems exist in all spheres of the 
operations of the organisation and are a necessary part of the process 
of management. work organisations are complex systems of social 
relationships, status and power, and attention should be given to the 
manager–subordinate relationships. The manager needs to understand 
the nature of power and control in order to improve work behaviour 
and organisational performance. 
 Learning outcomes 
 After completing this chapter you should have enhanced your ability to: 
 ●  explain the nature and importance of control in work organisations, and 
essential elements in a management control system; 
 ●  detail diff erent forms of control and characteristics of an eff ective control system;  
 ●  explain perspectives of organisational power and pluralistic approaches to power; 
 ●  debate the nature and impact of fi nancial and accounting systems of control; 
 ●  explore the concept of empowerment and the manager–subordinate 
relationship; 
 ●  examine the process of delegation, and the benefi ts and art of delegation; 
 ●  review the nature of organisational control and power, and infl uences on 
people’s patterns of behaviour. 
  CHAPTER 13 
 Organisational control and power 

470
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
The essence of control
In discussion on the nature of management (Chapter 10), reference was made to control as one 
of the essential features of managerial work. Traditional views of control placed emphasis on 
the need for conformity of activities with the organisation. Tannenbaum, for example, sees 
control as an inherent characteristic of the nature of organisations. The process of control is 
at the centre of the exchange between the benefits that the individual derives from membership 
of an organisation and the costs of such benefits.
Organization implies control. A social organization is an ordered arrangement of individual 
human interactions. Control processes help circumscribe idiosyncratic behaviors and keep 
them conformant to the rational plan of the organization. Organizations require a certain 
amount of conformity as well as the integration of diverse activities. It is the function of 
control to bring about conformance to organizational requirements and achievement of the 
ultimate purposes of the organization.1
With both control and power, discussed later, it is important to remember they are the per-
ceived influences over other people. It is the way in which people are seen rather than the 
actual control or power they are in a position to exercise.2
Feature of organisational behaviour
There is, however, far more to control than simply a means of restricting behaviour or the 
exercise of authority over others. Control is not only a function of the formal organisation 
and a hierarchical structure of authority, but also a feature of organisational behaviour and a 
function of interpersonal influence.2 By their very nature, control systems are concerned with 
the regulation of behaviour. Unfortunately ‘control’ often has an emotive connotation and 
is interpreted in a negative manner to suggest direction or command by the giving of orders. 
People may be suspicious of control systems and see them as emphasising punishment, an 
indication of authoritarian management and a means of exerting pressure and maintaining 
discipline. Some writers seem to take this view, and even to suggest that organisational control 
is exploitation of employees.3 Concern for the regulation of behaviour and improvement in 
performance raises questions as to the ethical nature of control. (Ethical behaviour in business 
is discussed in Chapter 14.)
Child suggests that although control is an essential process of management, it is strangely 
neglected by many writers on organisation. Among possible reasons for this is that:
control has a sinister ring to it, associated in people’s minds with power and manipulation. 
As a result, there may be some reluctance among many business school writers to discuss 
control, in order to avoid embarrassment for their sponsors in positions of corporate power. 
The claim that it is a purely technical process, concerning feedback on accounting and opera-
tions, also amounts to a desensitizing of the subject.4
Drummond, in a critical discussion about mechanistic thinking in organisations, makes the 
point: ‘Common sense suggests that control is preferable to anarchy, and more control is pref-
erable to less. While such assumptions are not necessarily wrong, they are not universally cor-
rect either.’5
Individual responses and behaviour
According to Cloke and Goldsmith, many employees have grown up in hierarchical organisations 
and become accustomed to external authority and the dead weight of organisational history.
Many employees actually prefer being told what to do by autocratic managers and are will-
ing to accept being treated like children in exchange for irresponsibility and reduced stress. 
They are willing to blindly obey hierarchical authority and keep silent before their superiors in 
exchange for job security. It is easier by far to be an unthinking drone who obeys orders from 

Chapter 13 OrganisaTiOnal cOnTrOl and pOwer
471
above than a self-managing team member who is responsible for results. 6 (You may wish to 
remind yourself of the discussion on Theory X and Theory Y management in  Chapter  10 .) 
 However, as  Wilson reminds us, individuals are not just passive objects of control: ‘They 
may accept, deny, react, reshape, rethink, acquiesce, rebel, or conform and create themselves 
within constraints imposed on them.’ 7 
 Watson points out that although process-rational thinking recognises the aspiration of 
those ‘in charge’ of work organisations to achieve control over work behaviours, it also recog-
nises two other things: 
 ●  Only partial control can ever be achieved. This is because organisations only exist through 
human relationships, and human relationships never allow the total control of some people 
over others. Power is rarely uncontested and, to a greater or less extent, attempts at control 
are typically resisted. 
 ●  Whatever control is achieved over work behaviour is brought about as much through pro-
cesses of negotiation, persuasion, manipulation and so on, as through system ‘devices’ 
such as rules and offi  cial procedures. 8 
 Most people show ambivalence towards control. While they may not wish to have it applied 
by other people to their own performance, they recognise the need for, and usefulness of, 
control systems. Individuals feel a sense of unease with what they perceive as lack of control 
over disruptive or anti-social actions or behaviour of work colleagues. Under certain condi-
tions, individuals may actually desire greater control over their work performance. Whenever 
a person enquires ‘I would like to know how well I am doing’, this can arguably be seen as 
asking for control in the form of improved feedback. Members of staff  want to know what 
is expected of them and how well they are progressing towards their objectives. Control can 
stand for reliability, order and stability. It is a basis for training needs, for the motivation to 
achieve standards and for the development of individuals. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 The controversial nature of control means that some writers avoid the word and use alternative terms such as ‘moni-
toring’ or ‘evaluating’. But whatever wording is used, the process of maintaining good order is a necessary feature of 
management and organisational behaviour. 
 To what extent do YOU agree? What term would YOU favour for this process, and why? 
 Improvement in performance 
 Control completes the cycle of managerial activities. It involves the planning and organisation 
of work functions, and guiding and regulating the activities of staff . The whole underlying 
purpose of management control is improvement in performance at both the individual and 
organisational level ( see  Figure  13.1 ). According to  Zimmermann, an organisation without 
control is impossible. 
  Every organization has control systems that co-ordinate the exercise of decision rights that 
are dispersed among individuals. Control systems also serve another important function in 
the organization. They measure how eff ectively decisions have been translated into results. 
This second feature of control systems relates to the goal achievement of the company. In this 
perspective, control systems are about infl uencing the behavior of individuals in the interest of 
the corporation. Both functions are closely interlinked. 9 
 Features of poor organisational performance can even lead to the collapse of a company.  10 A 
major international report undertaken by Proudfoot Consulting found that poor management 

472
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
in terms of inadequate planning and control and insufficient day-to-day supervision of work 
is still the largest single reason for lost productivity.11
Expression of managerial behaviour
The nature of management control is an organisational variable. Recall the discussion on the 
organisational environment (Chapter 3) and consider likely variations in the extent and form 
of control among a range of diverse organisations. While the need for some form of control is 
constant, the extent and manner of control is variable. The exercise of control is an expression 
of management systems and styles of behaviour. What is really important is what control is 
intended to achieve and the manner in which it is exercised.
More recent approaches question the extent to which culture is a means of organisation 
control. For example, Ray suggests that managers view organisational culture as an effective 
control tool12 and Egan refers to culture as the largest organisational control system.13 (See the 
discussion on organisational culture in Chapter 15.)
Elements of an organisational control system
Whatever the nature of control and whatever form it takes, there are five essential elements in 
an organisational control system (see Figure 13.2):
● planning objectives and targets;
● establishing standards of performance;
● monitoring actual performance;
● comparing actual achievement against the planned target; and
● rectifying and taking corrective action.
	1.	 Planning what is desired involves clarification of the aims to be achieved. It is important 
that people understand exactly what is required of them. This requires that objectives and 
targets are specified clearly, particularly key activities. Planning provides the framework 
against which the process of control takes place.
	2.	 Related to planning is the establishment of defined standards of performance. This requires 
realistic measurements by which achievement can be determined. Whenever possible these 
figure 13.1  The nature of management control

Chapter 13  Organisational control and power
473
measurements are given some measurable attribute and stated in quantitative terms. Rea-
sonable time scales should also be specified. Planning and measurement are prerequisites 
of control.
	3.	 The third aspect of control is the need for a means of monitoring actual performance. This 
requires clear channels of communication and feedback, a system of reporting information 
that is accurate, relevant and timely. Feedback also provides the basis for decisions to adjust 
the control system, for example the need to revise the original plan.
	4.	 Next, it is necessary to compare actual performance against planned targets. This requires 
a means of interpreting and evaluating information in order to give details of progress, 
reveal deviations and identify probable causes. This information should be communicated 
to those concerned to let them know how well they are getting on.
	5.	 The final element is taking corrective action to rectify the situation that has led to any fail-
ure to achieve objectives or targets, or other forms of deviations identified. This requires 
authority to take appropriate action to correct the situation, review the operation of the 
control system and make any necessary adjustments to objectives and targets or to the 
standards of performance.
Forms of control
Control is far-reaching; it can serve a number of functions concerned with general results or 
specific actions and can be manifested in a number of forms. For example, controls can be 
concerned with:
● observance of legislation, standing orders and policies and procedures;
● day-to-day operational activities that call for more specific standards of performance and 
speedy corrective action;
● health and safety of all members of the organisation or people in contact with the 
organisation;
● the structure of the organisation and role relationships;
● type of production system and use of technology;
● measurement of inputs, outputs, processes or the behaviour of people;
● recruitment and selection, socialisation, training and development;
● performance of the organisation as a whole or with major parts of it. Total quality control, 
concerned with all areas of the organisation, can be seen as part of total quality manage-
ment programmes (discussed in Chapter 16).

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
According to McKenna, organisational codes of conduct (discussed in Chapter 14) can consti-
tute another form of control:
Developing and distributing a code of conduct is a form of control that sets out the rules 
of behaviour and values with which an organisation’s senior managers expect their sub-
ordinates will conform. Such a code will only be accepted if subordinates observe that 
managers at all levels live this code in their actions, beliefs and involvement in collective 
learning.14
Control in the public sector
Public-sector organisations have political purposes and are concerned with service to and the 
well-being of the community. At the same time, there has been increased government pres-
sure to ensure cost-effectiveness, investment by private-sector involvement and efficiency and 
economy in their operations. The demand for uniformity of treatment and public accountabil-
ity for their operations results in high levels of bureaucracy, statutory controls, legislation and 
ministerial guidance. In the case of local government, for example, there is the added consid-
eration of the relationship between elected members and permanent officers.
Despite the apparent relaxation of authority and transfer of power from central govern-
ment, there is evidence that public-sector managers are under increasing political pressure. 
The demand for strategic management in the public sector has resulted in a greater emphasis 
on performance output measures with indicators of both a qualitative and quantitative nature.
Technology and control systems
From a further analysis of the data collected from Woodward’s South Essex study of 100 man-
ufacturing firms (discussed in Chapter 11), clear links emerged between the original classifica-
tion of technology and managerial control systems. Unit and small-batch production firms 
tended to have unitary and mainly personal controls. Process production firms tended to have 
unitary and mainly impersonal controls. In the case of large-batch and mass-production firms, 
those with predominantly personal controls had similar organisational characteristics to unit 
firms and those with predominantly mechanical controls had an organisation structure similar 
to process firms.
From the analysis, Reeves and Woodward suggest that control systems may be the underly-
ing variable that links organisational behaviour and technology. The classification of control 
systems they propose might provide a better means of predicting certain facets of organisa-
tional behaviour than the classification of technology.15
Wilson points out that technology is not just about devices and machines but also about 
social relations that encourage some form of interaction. Technology is a human, political and 
social activity: ‘The locus of control cannot always be moved from workers to managers dur-
ing technical change nor from managers to workers. Control ultimately does lie with manage-
ment, though workers may resist it.’16
Information and communications technology
In previous chapters we have referred to the impact of developments in ICT and these develop-
ments will also have a significant impact on management control systems. Processes of com-
munication are increasingly linked to computer systems with the rapid transmission of more 
information to more people, including immediate access to other national or international 
offices. IT and office automation are changing the nature of the workplace and the way in 
which people work. For example, advances in telecommunications have resulted in a signifi-
cant growth in telecommuting, with staff working from home with a computer network, tel-
ephone, etc. This has many potential advantages but also raises questions of self-motivation, 
security and systems of management control.

Chapter 13 OrganisaTiOnal cOnTrOl and pOwer
475
 Another interesting situation arising from the increasing use of IT is the legal position on 
organisations monitoring staff  emails and Internet usage.  (A more detailed discussion on tech-
nology, work and organisational behaviour is included in  Chapter  12 .) 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Technology is the ultimate determinant of an effective control system, whether for mass-production systems, virtual 
teams or remote working, personal surveillance or working from home. There is not less control today, only different 
forms of control. 
 What are YOUR views? How do YOU believe technology is likely to influence the nature of control over YOUR behav-
iour at work? 
 Concertive control 
 Barker refers to a change from hierarchical, bureaucratic control to concertive control through 
the interaction of members in self-managing teams.  Concertive control is not exerted by man-
agers but by the value consensus of the team to a system of normative rules. Workers form 
their own cultural norms rather than bureaucratic rules and develop means for their own 
control. 
  I don’t have to sit here and look for the boss to be around; and if the boss is not around, I can 
sit there and talk to my neighbor or do what I want. Now the whole team is around me and 
the whole team is observing what I’m doing. 17 
 However,  Wright and Barker refer to the need for some form of functional self-control as 
an element of teamwork, though research has identifi ed concertive control as a factor con-
straining teamwork. Teams can struggle with the collective manner in which teams control 
their own behaviours. Concertive peer-enforced control can create powerful constraining or 
oppressive systems. Negative implications can arise within a team when a concertive control 
system is either too constraining or too loose and that parallels disadvantages of external 
control systems. 18 
 Strategies of control in organisations 
 Six signifi cant strategies of control in organisations are explained by  Child ( see  Figure  13.3 ): 
  1.  personal centralised control; 
  2.  bureaucratic control; 
  3.  output control; 
  4.  control through electronic surveillance; 
  5.  HRM control; and 
  6.  cultural control. 19  
 Personal centralised controls 
 These are often found in small, owner-managed organisations and characterised by centralisa-
tion of decision-making and initiative around a leadership fi gure. Control consists largely of 
personal supervision and inspection. Once the organisation grows large enough to employ 
someone to undertake detailed supervision of everyday tasks, the locus of decision-making 
and close supervision will tend to become separated. The authority of the leader will usually 
rest upon the rights of ownership, special personal qualities (charisma) or technical expertise. 

476
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Bureaucratic control
Familiar in public-sector organisations and many other types of large organisations, this form 
of control is based on the specification of how members should behave and carry out their 
work. There is an attempt to ensure predictability through formal job descriptions and pro-
cedures, and the specification of standard methods for the performance of tasks. Compliance

communication technology (ICT)

behaviour, and capabilities desired by management

6	 Cultural control

6.2	 strong emphasis on the collective and mutually supportive character of the 
organisation – e.g. analogy with the ‘family’ 
6.3	 employment characterised by security of tenure and progression within the 
organisation 
6.4	 semi-autonomous working: few formal controls 
*Some authorities distinguish this as a separate control strategy. For example, Richard Edwards (1979), Contested 
Terrain: The Transformation of the Workplace in the Twentieth Century, New York, Basic Books.

can be rewarded by upgrading, improved status, favourable employment benefits and job secu-
rity. Bureaucratic control will make use of accounting control systems such as budgetary con-
trol and standard cost variances. The bureaucratic strategy also permits delegation without 
loss of control. Managers can delegate routine decision-making within formally prescribed 
limits of discretion.
Output control
This relies upon the ability to identify specific tasks having a measurable output or criterion of 
overall achievement – for example, an end-product, a part manufactured to agreed standards, 
batch production or a sub-assembly. Rewards and sanctions can be related to performance 
levels expressed in output terms. Output control strategy is aimed at facilitating the delegation 
of operational decision-making without the need for bureaucratic controls or relying on close 
personal supervision. Output control may be difficult to apply to certain activities, such as the 
legal department of a business organisation.
Control through electronic surveillance
The essence of control is that the speed and quality of work is recorded and assessed remotely 
through the use of ICT without reliance on personal supervision. Monitoring of performance 
can be used readily as the basis for reward and discipline. Control through electronic sur-
veillance is applied to many types and levels of activity. A common example is call centres, 
although customer-service representatives dislike the pressure from this form of control and 
the objectivity of relying on electronically produced statistics is subject to challenge.
HRM control
HRM procedures can be used both to develop people at work and to control their behav-
iour and performance. Systematic selection techniques are designed to ensure new recruits fit 
the profile and technical competencies required by management. Performance evaluation and 
appraisal provide feedback to both management and employees. Appraisals should provide 
the basis for reward and for an assessment of the need for further training or development.
Cultural control
This moves away from conventional forms of organisation and is based on maintaining con-
trol through internalised compliance rather than external constraint. The basis of cultural 
control is the acceptance and willing compliance with the requirements of management and 
belief of the organisation. A major example is the cultural control that tends to be exemplified 
by larger Japanese corporations, although this is subject to criticism of compulsory sociabil-
ity. Cultural control, combined with personal autonomy, have long been associated with the 
professions. Despite criticisms of cultural control it is in tune with the increasing number 
of professional and knowledge workers, and is consistent with self-managing units or teams 
working with only limited formal controls.
Characteristics of an effective control system
Whatever the nature or form of control, there are a number of characteristic features of an 
effective control system. Control systems can have positive as well as negative effects. It is 
important therefore that they are designed and implemented in a constructive and rewarding 
way. An effective control system should:
● Be understood by those involved in its operation. The purpose of the control system and the 
information it provides must be fully comprehensible to those who have to act on the results.

478
part 4 sTrUcTUre, sTraTegY and eFFecTiVeness
 ●  Draw attention to the critical activities important to the success of the organisation. Care-
ful control must be maintained in key result areas and in those activities that are crucial to 
the success of the organisation. 
 ●  Conform with the structure of the organisation and be related to decision centres respon-
sible for performance.  Information should be supplied to those managers who have the 
responsibility for specifi ed areas of activity and presented in a form that shows clearly when 
corrective action is necessary. 
 ●  Be consistent with the objective of the activity to which it relates. In addition to locating 
deviations from the planned standard of performance, the control system should be sophis-
ticated enough to indicate ways in which performance can be improved. For example, in the 
fi eld of social services it may not be suffi  cient just to know that expenditure has been kept 
within the budget. It would be more helpful to know in what areas expenditure has been 
incurred. 
 ●  Report deviations from the desired standard of performance as quickly as possible. Ide-
ally, indications of likely deviations should be discovered before they actually occur. For 
example, information that the budget is likely to be overspent or underspent should arrive 
in suffi  cient time to enable those responsible to do something about it and avoid drastic 
last-minute action. 
 ●  Be fl exible and yield information that is not infl uenced by other factors unconnected to the 
purpose of the control system. For example, a control system that specifi es that reports 
to top management should be made whenever expenditure exceeds the same set amount 
means high-spending departments may be subject to excessive control and low-spending 
departments not monitored closely enough. 
 ●  Be subject to a continual review to ensure they are eff ective and appropriate in terms of 
the results they produce. They should not be too costly or elaborate, but should satisfy the 
characteristic features suggested above. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 control systems would avoid all criticisms and negative reactions if the choice of strategy and essential characteris-
tics were compatible with the nature and culture of the particular organisation. 
 Do YOU believe this to be fair comment? How well do YOU believe the strategy and operations of control in YOUR 
university are compatible with its nature and culture? 
 Power and management control 
 Work organisations are not only systems of hierarchical structure, but also systems of intri-
cate social relationships, status and power.  Power is a complex and dynamic concept and diffi  -
cult to defi ne easily.  At a broad level, power can be interpreted in terms of control or infl uence 
over the behaviour of other people with or without their consent. Sometimes power is inter-
preted in terms of the  extent of the infl uence that can actually be exercised over other people, 
and sometimes it is taken to include infl uence over objects or things as well as people. Like the 
meaning of control, power can have an emotive connotation. 
 However, power is an inherent feature of work organisations and is often the underlying 
reality behind the decision-making process. It is central to the framework of order and system 
of command through which the work and activities of the organisation are carried out, and 
the implementation of policies and procedures. Lack of power and infl uence, and offi  ce poli-
tics, are among the main sources of managerial stress within organisations. 
 Robbins and Judge suggest that as power may exist but not be used, it implies a potential 
that need not be actualised to be eff ective. Power is therefore a capacity or a potential. The most 

Chapter 13  Organisational control and power
479
important aspect of power is probably dependency: ‘A person can have power over you only if 
he or she controls something you desire.’20
Caulkin points out that, visible or not, power shapes everything. Hierarchy occurs every-
where in the natural order.
Yet for all the words devoted to ‘official’ topics such as strategy, leadership, shareholder value 
and customer focus, the truth is that the drive to win and keep power is the ‘invisible hand’ 
that yanks the strings which determine much of what happens in business.21
The view of power as of functional importance is in keeping with a unitary approach to 
organisation. Management control is the predominant means by which the activities of staff 
are guided towards the achievement of organisational goals. The exercise of power is that 
which comes from a position of formal authority within the management structure of the 
organisation and that legitimises control over subordinate staff.
Types of authority and organisations
In one of the earliest studies of formal organisations, Weber distinguished three types of 
authority: traditional, charismatic and legal–rational.22 These types of authority are based on 
the form of control regarded as legitimate by subordinates and their acceptance of the power 
of superiors. The three types of authority relate to different types of organisations.
● In traditional organisations, authority is legitimised by custom and a long-standing belief 
in the natural right to rule, or is possessed by traditional (‘proper’) procedure. Examples 
would be the authority of the pope, kings or queens or a paternalistic employer.
● In charismatic organisations, authority is legitimised by belief in the personal qualities of 
the leader; authority is based on the leader’s strength of personality and inspiration. Win-
ston Churchill might be quoted as an example. The practical need for some routine, for 
procedures and systems and for economic support means that if the movement is to con-
tinue it must become organised. On the impending demise of the charismatic leader, the 
movement might collapse unless a ‘legitimate’ heir is found. This process tends to trans-
form a charismatic organisation into either a traditional organisation or a bureaucratic 
organisation.
● In bureaucratic organisations, authority is based on the acceptance of the law of formal 
rules and procedures, and on impersonal principles. There is a legal–rational authority that 
stems from hierarchical position in the organisation and not from personality. Examples 
are the armed forces and the authority of government ministers or a college principal.
The concept of legal–rational authority is of most interest to us because most business 
organisations, particularly large-scale ones, tend to be of the bureaucratic type of structure, 
although there are variations in degree. Bureaucracy, as applying to certain structural features 
of organisation, is the most dominant type of formal organisation. (Bureaucracy as a form of 
structure is discussed in Chapter 2.)
Power, involvement and compliance
From a comparative analysis of complex organisations, Etzioni provides a classification of 
organisational relationships based on structures of control and the use of power resources as 
a means of ensuring compliance among members.23
Power differs according to the means by which members of the organisation comply:
● Coercive power relies on the use of threats, or physical sanctions or force, for example con-
trolling the need for food or comfort.
● Remunerative power involves the manipulation of material resources and rewards, for 
example through salaries and wages.
● Normative power relies on the allocation and the manipulation of symbolic rewards, for 
example esteem and prestige.

480
part 4 sTrUcTUre, sTraTegY and eFFecTiVeness
 Involvement is the degree of commitment by members to the organisation: 
 ●  Alienative involvement occurs where members are involved against their wishes. There is a 
strong negative orientation towards the organisation. 
 ●  Calculative involvement occurs where attachment to the organisation is motivated by 
extrinsic rewards. There is either a negative orientation or a low positive orientation 
towards the organisation. 
 ●  Moral involvement is based on the individual’s belief in, and value placed on, the goals of 
the organisation. There is high positive orientation towards the organisation. 
 When considered together, nine logical types of organisational relationships and compliance 
result from this typology ( see  Figure  13.4 ). Etzioni suggests that a particular kind of power 
usually goes with a particular kind of involvement: 
 ●  coercive power with alienative involvement – relationship 1 (typifi ed, for example, by 
prisons); 
 ●  remunerative power with calculative involvement – relationship 5 (typifi ed, for example, by 
business fi rms); 
 ●  normative power with moral involvement – relationship 9 (typifi ed, for example, by 
churches). 
 The matching of these kinds of power and involvement is congruent with each other and 
represents the most common form of compliance in organisations. The other six types of 
organisational relationships are incongruent. Etzioni suggests that organisations with con-
gruent compliance structures will be more eff ective than organisations with incongruent 
structures.

 Critical review and refl ection 
 power is often associated with coercive and repressive features of social life but it is an inherent and necessary part 
of work organisations. what is important is the motivation for the use of power and manner in which it is exercised. 
 What are YOUR views? To what extent do YOU accept power as an essential feature of management and organisa-
tional behaviour? 

Chapter 13  Organisational control and power
481
Perspectives of organisational power
Watson suggests that power operates at three levels:
● The level of societies, where some people have a much greater capacity to influence others 
and gain a greater share of the ‘good things’ of that society.
● The level of organisation structures and cultures, where certain people are put into posi-
tions where they can shape what others do and take a greater share of the ‘rewards’ made 
available by the organisation.
● The interpersonal level, where some people get other people to do things they otherwise 
would not do and, as a result of this, typically ‘do better’ than these people in terms of the 
material and symbolic rewards available to people in the organisation.24
At the organisational level there are many potential sources of power that enable members 
of an organisation to further their own interests and that provide a means of resolv-
ing conflicts. Sources of organisational power include, for example, culture, structure, 
formal authority, rules and regulations, standing orders, control of the decision-making 
process, control of resources and technology, control of information or knowledge, trade 
unions and staff organisations, age coupled with experience, gender and the informal 
organisation.
Gender and power
You may recall the suggestion of the sex power differential as part of the evaluation of the 
Hawthorne experiments (discussed in Chapter 2). An example of gender and power is given 
by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who report on a survey on women in posi-
tions of power and influence. The survey found noticeable examples of the lack of women in 
senior positions of power, including those in the senior civil service, top management, judici-
ary, health service, directors of FTSE companies, Members of Parliament and senior appoint-
ments in the armed forces and the police force.
Outdated working patterns and inflexible organisations continue to be the major barriers to 
women’s participation in positions of authority. Company culture where long hours are the 
norm and the unequal division of domestic responsibilities limit women’s potential to find 
the time and energy these top posts demand . . . As a nation, we cannot afford to waste 
the talent available to run our national institutions. As well as the moral argument for gender 
equality in positions of power and influence, women’s equal participation in public, political 
and cultural institutions can play a pivotal role in the advancement of women . . . Where 
women do find positions of power and influence it is more likely to be in the public and vol-
untary sectors.25
Social exchange theory
Social exchange theory (discussed in Chapter 1) can give rise to an imbalance of power among 
individual members of the organisation. Social exchanges are influenced by a web of power 
relationships and are not always equal. Individuals will seek to achieve a positive balance 
for themselves by maximising benefits and minimising costs of exchanges. Those with more 
power are likely to fare better in their dealings with others. As an example, part-time or casual 
staff often feel they have less power than their full-time colleagues. Bloisi, et al. suggest that 
one negative outcome is when ethnic minorities or women are confined to the low end of the 
power spectrum, caused in part by their fewer numbers and by token dynamics. Bloisi et al. 
also suggest that, in some cases, language is used as a power tactic to put down a minority or 
to be condescending.26

482
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Pluralistic approaches to power
A classification by French and Raven of social power based on a broader perception of leader-
ship influence was discussed earlier (Chapter 9).27 French and Raven identified five main sources 
of power: reward power; coercive power; legitimate power; referent power; and expert power.
Power, however, arises not only from sources of structure or formal position within the 
organisation, but also from interpersonal sources such as the personality, experience, char-
acteristics and talents of individual members of the organisation. For example, the discus-
sion also covered charisma, or personal power, as a feature of transformational leadership. We 
can also distinguish between legitimate (organisational) power, which derives from a person’s 
position within the formal structure of the organisation and the managerial hierarchy of com-
mand, and personal (informal) power, which derives from the individual and is in the eye of 
the beholders who believe that the person has the ability to influence other people or events 
and to make things happen.
The exercise of power is, then, a social process that derives from a multiplicity of sources 
and situations.28 This suggests a more pluralistic approach and recognises power as a major 
organisational variable. Many different groups and individuals have the ability to influence 
the behaviour and actions of other people, and in a number of different ways. This is not a 
new concept, however. In the 1920s the renowned management writer Mary Parker Follett 
focused on a human-behaviour aspect, rejected the notion of domination and the exercise of 
power over other people, and argued for developing power with others in the organisation to 
make things happen. Effective control over work processes and social relationships would be 
achieved through group power and co-operative management. Follett advocated the replace-
ment of personal power with the authority of task or function, and successful management 
based on the ‘law of the situation’.29
Network of social relationships
Organisations function on the basis of networks of interdependent activities. Certain jobs or 
work relationships enable people to exercise a level of power in excess of their formal position 
within the structure of the organisation. A classic example is someone, perhaps a personal 
assistant or office manager, who fulfils the role of gatekeeper to the boss (discussed in Chap-
ter 11). Another example is with IT problems where comparatively junior members of staff 
with particular technical expertise may have a way of ignoring the normal chain of command.
Many people within organisations also have the ability to grant or withhold ‘favours’ 
within the formal or the informal interpretation of their job role – for example, caretakers, 
security staff and telephonists. Staff may exercise negative power – that is, ‘the capacity to stop 
things happening, to delay them, to distort or disrupt them’.30 A common example could be 
the secretary who screens and intercepts messages to the boss, delays arranging appointments 
and filters mail. Negative power is not necessarily related proportionately to position and may 
often be exercised easily by people at lower levels of the hierarchical structure.
Realities of organisational life
A reality of organisational life is the vagaries of social relationships including power, office 
politics, and also the grapevine and gossip.
Misselhorn, for example, suggests that:
Power is often seen as a dirty word. Yet it is a reality of human experience. We all use power 
in one way or another. We are also strongly influenced by our values. Then we draw on both 
our values and our power in what we believe to be our rational thinking about a problem 
situation. The difficulty we have is that ‘power’ and ‘values’ are mostly hidden forces which 
are at work from international politics to shop floor problem solving.31

Chapter 13 OrganisaTiOnal cOnTrOl and pOwer
483
 Hazlehurst refers to the hoary old question of offi  ce politics: 
 We’re all supposed to abhor it, but the truth is that power games are instinctive and most of 
us enjoy at least a modest level of politicking – either as players or amused spectators. And 
a recent study found that remote workers – with fewer opportunities to be seen to be in the 
right places and talk to the right people – get lower pay rises and fewer promotions than 
those who spend their days in the offi  ce, dripping honey into appropriate ears. 
 Hazlehurst also refers to Sandberg, COO of Facebook, who ‘retains that most traditional 
symbol of corporate power, a corner offi  ce’. 32 
 Although a diffi  cult topic to pin down,  Mann refers to the key role that gossip plays in 
power relationships and knowledge production in organisations and maintains that: ‘There is 
an undeniable relationship between knowledge and power which lies at the root of gossiping.’ 33 
 Motivational need for power and control 
 Power can be a positive source of motivation for some people  (see the discussion on achieve-
ment motivation in  Chapter  7 ). There is often a fi ne line between the motivation to achieve 
personal dominance and the use of social power. It has to be acknowledged, however, that 
there are some people who positively strive for and enjoy the exercise of power over other peo-
ple. Some managers seek to maintain absolute control over subordinates and the activities of 
their department/section, and welcome the feeling of being indispensable. The possession of 
power is an ultimate ego satisfaction, and such managers do not seem unduly concerned if as 
a result they are unpopular with, or lack the respect of, their colleagues or subordinate staff . 
 Kirwan-Taylor discusses control freaks who exist in every offi  ce and are capable of making 
everyone’s life a misery. Control freaks try to dominate the environment by establishing order 
on what they perceive as chaos and attempting to control how other people think and behave. 
At one end of the spectrum are motivated and organised employees and at the other end 
obsessional, temperamental bullies. Sometimes, however, being a control freak is considered a 
positive attribute and key to success. Although control freaks function to a high standard, few 
people can bear to work with them. 34 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 lack of power and influence is a potential source of frustration and stress. in reality, most people in the work organi-
sation actively seek power. it is a natural characteristic of human behaviour and will always be so. 
 Be honest – to what extent do YOU seek power, and for what reasons? 
 Financial and accounting systems of control 
 Management control systems are frequently thought of in terms of fi nancial and accounting 
systems. The reasons for this are easy to understand: 
 ●  The stewardship of fi nancial resources is of vital concern to the majority of organisations. 
In both private-enterprise and public-sector organisations there is an increasing need to 
demonstrate value for money expended. Organisational aims, objectives and targets are 
often expressed in fi nancial terms and measured in terms of profi tability. Results are meas-
ured and reported in fi nancial terms. 
 ●  Money is quantifi able and a precise unit of measurement. It is easily understood, and often 
used as a common denominator and as a basis for comparison. Financial limits are easy 

484
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
to apply as a measure of control and easy to relate to. For example, the need for control 
is an integral part of the process of delegation or empowerment. This control may easily 
be applied where, for example, a manager gives a subordinate the authority, without prior 
reference, to incur expenditure on certain items up to a given financial cost limit.
Accounting systems and human behaviour
It is understandable, therefore, that so much attention is given to financial and accounting 
systems of measurement and control. However, accounting statements focus on only a limited 
area of activity. Management control embraces far more than just financial or accounting con-
siderations. It is concerned with the whole process of management: with the extent to which 
organisational aims are achieved and with improvement in performance.
In their discussion of the role of accounting systems in organisational control, it is interest-
ing to note the words of Berry et al.:
Accounting systems provide a fundamental way of handling high levels of complexity by 
the imposition of a set of standard operating procedures; this provides a major strength 
of accounting as a control system. However, weaknesses also stem from the imposition 
of standard systems in complex situations because inventive human minds find ways of 
reporting desired results through the manipulation of the system rather than by behaving in 
expected ways.35
This wording appears to imply that the accounting system is the arbiter of correct behaviour 
and that people are to ‘blame’ for their failure to act in the way imposed by accounting systems 
(and presumably by the accountants who designed them).
Accounting control systems such as internal audit, management by exception and budg-
etary control tend to operate in a negative way and to report only on the unfavourable, or 
on favourable variances that may have adverse consequences – for example, less spent than 
budgeted. ‘Success’ for the accounting staff may be equated with the ‘failure’ of other staff. 
As a result there is no specific recognition from management. There is only a limited sense 
of achievement or self-esteem for favourable performance or where no corrective action is 
required. There is little, if any, positive motivation.
There is, of course, nothing wrong with the use of accounting systems of control such as 
internal auditing, management by exception and budgetary control. Control systems can have 
positive as well as negative effects. Financial and accounting control systems, as with other 
forms of control, should be designed and implemented in a constructive and rewarding way. 
To do this, they must take account of individual, social and organisational factors that deter-
mine people’s patterns of behaviour.
Hilton suggests that the modern manager often lacks any feel for the unique culture of a 
business and therefore has an insufficient understanding or appreciation of the true drivers of 
its success. Unlike most developed countries, UK boardrooms are dominated by people with a 
financial background. The problem is that financial control is not enough. Conventional risk 
control systems can cover hard data, technical know-how, systems and strategies. What they 
do not do is handle softer issues such as management style, employee motivation, shared val-
ues and corporate culture.36
Influencing skills
Clearly power, in whatever form, is needed to get work done. As Owen points out, power skills 
are becoming more important because the nature of the manager’s job is changing.
It is now normal for managers to find that their responsibilities exceed their authority. In 
the past, the art of management was getting things done through other people, whom the 

Chapter 13  Organisational control and power

manager controlled. Now managers have to get things done through other people whom 
they do not control. The lack of control changes everything. New skills are required to make 
things happen when you lack formal authority. These skills include:
● Building networks of trust and influence
● Creating alliances to make things happen
● Dealing with conflict
● Shaping the organisation’s agenda to meet your needs
● Dealing with organisational conflict and resistance
● Managing ambiguity and uncertainty
● Finding the right assignments and projects to work on
● Discovering the real rules of survival and success in your firm.37
Yukl suggests that rather than focusing exclusively on power as a source of potential influence, 
more attention is being given to specific types of behaviour used to exercise influence:
Rational Persuasion – the use of logical arguments and factual persuasion
Apprising – explaining the personal benefits or career advancement
Inspiration Appeals – to values and ideas or attempt to gain commitment
Consultation – seeking support and assistance by asking for assistance
Exchange – incentives or willingness to reciprocate
Collaboration – providing relevant resources and assistance in exchange for proposed 
change
Personal Appeals – based on friendship or personal favour
Ingratiation – use of praise or flattery
Legitimating Tactics – establishing legitimacy or verifying authority
Pressure – use of demands, threats, frequent checking
Coalition Tactics – seeking the aid or support of others.38
Balance between order and flexibility
Stewart refers to the classic dilemma that underlies the nature of control: finding the right 
balance for present conditions between order and flexibility. This involves the trade-off 
between trying to improve predictability of people’s actions against the desirability of 
encouraging individual and local responsiveness to changing situations. The organisation 
may need a ‘tight–loose’ structure, with certain departments or areas of work closely con-
trolled (‘tight’) while other departments or areas of work should be left fluid and flexible 
(‘loose’).39
According to Stewart, ‘control can – and should – be exercised in different ways’. She iden-
tifies three main forms of control:
● Direct control by orders, direct supervision and rules and regulations. Direct controls may 
be necessary, and more readily acceptable, in a crisis situation and during training. But in 
organisations where people expect to participate in decision-making, such forms of control 
may be unacceptable. Rules and regulations that are not accepted as reasonable, or at least 
not unreasonable, will offer some people a challenge to use their ingenuity in finding ways 
round them.
● Control through standardisation and specialisation. This is achieved through clear defini-
tion of the inputs to a job, the methods to be used and the required outputs. Such bureau-
cratic control makes clear the parameters within which one can act and paradoxically 
makes decentralisation easier. Provided the parameters are not unduly restrictive they can 
increase the sense of freedom. For example, within clearly defined limits that ensure that 
one retail chain store looks like another, individual managers may have freedom to do the 
job as they wish.

486
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
● Control through influencing the way that people think about what they should do. This is 
often the most effective method of exercising control. It may be achieved through selective 
recruitment of people who seem likely to share a similar approach, through the training 
and socialisation of people into thinking the organisation’s way and through peer pressure. 
Where an organisation has a very strong culture, people who do not fit in, or learn to adapt, 
are likely to be pushed out, even though they may appear to leave of their own volition.
Stewart also refers to a second, related dilemma of finding the appropriate balance between 
centralisation, as a means of exercising control, and decentralisation. (Centralisation and 
decentralisation are discussed in Chapter 11.)
Behavioural factors in control systems
Control systems can help fulfil people’s needs at work and their presence may be welcomed by 
some members of staff. Often, however, control systems are perceived as a threat to the need 
satisfaction of the individual. Even when control systems are well designed and operated they 
may be viewed with a certain amount of suspicion and possible resentment by members of 
staff. Control often provokes an emotional response from those affected by it. Control over 
behaviour may be resented and provoke dislike of those responsible for its operation. Control 
systems provide an interface between human behaviour and the process of management. The 
manner in which control is exercised and the perception of staff will have a significant effect on 
the level of organisational performance.
There are a number of factors, discussed in other chapters, that can affect the successful 
implementation of management control systems, including the following:
● Attitudes and response of staff. That is, the way they perceive reasons for and methods of 
control. Consideration by management to the influences of diversity and inclusion. The 
extent to which control may help as a learning and development experience.
● Motivation. Motivation is a function of the relationship between effort expended and per-
ceived level of performance. Recognition for a satisfactory level of attainment coupled with 
a suitable reward system, as integral parts of control, can do much to motivate staff and 
encourage improved performance.
● Groups and the informal organisation. Membership of a harmonious and effective work 
group can be a source of motivation and job satisfaction. Socialisation can help create a 
feeling of commitment to the group and reduce the need for formal management control. 
With the development of autonomous work groups, members have greater freedom and 
wider discretion over the planning, execution and control of their own work. Informal 
group ‘norms’ and peer pressure can be one of the most powerful forms of control.
● Leadership style and systems of management. The style of managerial leadership is a func-
tion of the manager’s attitudes towards people, and assumptions about human nature and 
behaviour – for example, McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y. The character of control 
processes is one of the organisational variables identified in Likert’s fourfold model of man-
agement systems. With System 4 (participative group), concern for performance of control 
functions is spread throughout the organisation, review and control functions are carried 
out at all levels, and the formal and informal organisation share the same goals.
● Consultation and participation. If staff are committed personally to particular objectives 
they are more likely to direct themselves and to exercise self-control over their level of 
performance.
● Organisation structure. Organisations with a mechanistic structure are more readily suited 
to the operation and implementation of traditional systems of control. In organic struc-
tures the effectiveness of control is more dependent upon individual involvement and com-
mitment to the aims of the organisation. Increased flexible working arrangements and 
homeworking call for greater trust from managers.

 The concept of empowerment 
 Discussion on the balance between order and fl exibility, and control versus autonomy, draws 
attention to the importance of empowerment. Despite a general movement towards less mech-
anistic structures and the role of managers as facilitators, there appears to be some reluctance, 
especially among top managers, to dilute or weaken hierarchical control. 
 Empowerment is generally explained in terms of allowing employees greater freedom, 
autonomy and self-control over their work, and responsibility for decision-making. However, 
there are diff erences in the meaning and interpretation of the term. The concept of empower-
ment also gives rise to a number of questions and doubts. For example, how does it diff er in 
any meaningful way from other earlier forms of employee involvement? Is the primary con-
cern of empowerment getting the most out of the workforce? Is empowerment just another 
somewhat more fanciful term for delegation? Some writers see the two as quite separate con-
cepts while other writers suggest empowerment is a more proactive form of delegation. 
 According to  Mills and Friesen, ‘Empowerment can be succinctly defi ned as the authority 
of subordinates to decide and act.’ 
 It describes a management style. The term is often confused with delegation but, if strictly 
defi ned, empowerment goes much further in granting subordinates authority to decide and 
act. Indeed, within a context of broad limits defi ned by executives, empowered individuals 
may even become self-managing. 40 
 Skill of empowerment and delegation 
 Delegation is not an easy task. Empowering other people is a matter of judgement. It involves 
the question of discretion. It involves behavioural as well as organisational and economic con-
siderations, and it is subject to a number of possible abuses. Eff ective delegation is a social 
skill. It requires a clear understanding of people-perception, reliance on other people, confi -
dence and trust, and courage. It is important that the manager knows what to delegate, when 
and to whom. Matters of policy and disciplinary power, for example, usually rest with the 
manager and cannot legitimately be delegated. 
 Attempting to distinguish clearly between empowerment and delegation is not always clear. 
However, empowerment is viewed generally as the more embracing term that describes a man-
agement style and granting of genuine additional power to other members of staff . Empower-
ment is viewed as the more embracing process. Arguably, it is the process of empowerment 
that gives rise to the act of delegation. According to  Tulgan, for example: ‘The key to empow-
erment is eff ective delegation; giving individual contributors ownership of tangible results.’ 41 
 At the individual (or personal) level,  delegation is the process of entrusting authority and 
responsibility to others throughout the various levels of the organisation. It is the authorisa-
tion to undertake activities that would otherwise be carried out by someone in a more senior 
position. Downsizing and de-layering have arguably limited the opportunities for delegation, 
although this may be off set by demands for greater fl exibility and empowerment. In any event, 
delegation is still an essential process of management. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 it is a poor manager who relies on the exercise of formal power and position within the hierarchical structure of 
control. personal power is the only way to achieve effective leadership influence and control.

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Extreme forms of behaviour
The concept of delegation may appear to be straightforward. However, anyone with experience 
of a work situation is likely to be aware of the consequences of badly managed delegation. 
Successful delegation is a social skill. Where managers lack this skill, or do not have a sufficient 
awareness of people-perception, there are two extreme forms of behaviour that can result:
● At one extreme is the almost total lack of meaningful delegation. Subordinate staff are only 
permitted to operate within closely defined and often routine areas of work, with detailed 
supervision. Staff are treated as if they are incapable of thinking for themselves and given 
little or no opportunity to exercise initiative or responsibility.
● At the other extreme there can be an excessive zeal for so-called delegation when a manager 
leaves subordinates to their own resources, often with only minimal guidance or training, 
and expects them to take the consequences for their own actions or decisions. These ‘super-
delegators’ misuse the practice of delegation and are often like the Artful Dodger, and 
somehow contrive not to be around when difficult situations arise. Such a form of behav-
iour is not delegation; it is an abdication of the manager’s responsibility.
Either of these two extreme forms of behaviour can be frustrating and potentially stressful for 
subordinate staff, and unlikely to lead to improved organisational effectiveness. The nature of 
delegation can have a significant effect on the morale, motivation and work performance of 
staff. In all but the smallest organisation the only way to get work done effectively is through 
delegation, but even such an important practice can be misused or over-applied.
The manager–subordinate relationship
Delegation is not just the arbitrary shedding of work. It is not just the issuing and following 
of orders or carrying out of specified tasks in accordance with detailed instructions. Within 
the formal structure of the organisation, delegation creates a special manager–subordinate 
relationship. It is founded on the concept of:
● authority;
● responsibility; and
● accountability (ultimate responsibility).
● Authority is the right to take action or make decisions that the manager would otherwise 
have done. Authority legitimises the exercise of empowerment within the structure and rules 
of the organisation. It enables the subordinate to issue valid instructions for others to follow.
● Responsibility involves an obligation by the subordinate to perform certain duties or make 
certain decisions and having to accept possible reprimand from the manager for unsatisfac-
tory performance. The meaning of the term ‘responsibility’ is, however, subject to possible 
confusion: although delegation embraces both authority and responsibility, effective del-
egation is not abdication of responsibility.
● Accountability is interpreted as meaning ultimate responsibility and cannot be delegated. 
Managers have to accept ‘responsibility’ for the control of their staff, for the performance 
of all duties allocated to their department/section within the structure of the organisation 
and for the standard of results achieved. That is, ‘the buck stops here’.
The subordinate is responsible to the manager for doing the job, while the manager is respon-
sible for seeing that the job gets done. The manager is accountable to a superior for the actions 
of subordinates.
Authority commensurate with responsibility
Delegation, therefore, embraces both authority and responsibility. It is not practical to del-
egate one without the other (see Figure 13.5). Responsibility must be supported by authority 
and by power to influence areas of performance for which the subordinate is held responsible. 

Chapter 13 OrganisaTiOnal cOnTrOl and pOwer
489
Authority can be delegated readily, but many problems of delegation stem from failure to 
delegate suffi  cient authority to enable subordinates to fulfi l their responsibilities. For example, 
if a section head is held responsible to a departmental manager for the performance of junior 
staff  but is not empowered (given authority) to infl uence their selection and appointment, their 
motivation, the allocation of their duties, their training and development, or their sanctions 
and rewards, then the section leader can hardly be held responsible for unsatisfactory perfor-
mance of the junior staff . To hold subordinates responsible for certain areas of performance 
without also conferring on them the necessary authority within the limits of that responsibil-
ity is an abuse of delegation. 
 The manager should accept the blame as the person  accountable for the performance 
of the department/section, and obligated to see that the task was completed satisfactorily. 
It is necessary to maintain the organisational hierarchy and structure of command. Man-
agers should protect and support subordinate staff  and accept, personally, any reprimand 
for unsatisfactory performance. It is then up to managers to sort out things in their own 
department/section, to counsel members of staff  concerned and to review their system of 
delegation. 
 Bushe emphasises the continuing importance of authority. 
 Contrary to popular images and poorly thought through books on the subject, collaborative 
work systems do not decrease or eliminate authority even if they do fl atten hierarchies and 
reduce command and control – quite the contrary. Authority and hierarchy are two separate 
things. Authority is the power to make and enforce decisions. Collaborative organizations 
create much more authority than command and control systems do because in collaborative 
organizations, authority is dispersed widely . . . But collaborative organizations still require 
hierarchy for focus and direction. 42 
 Figure 13.5  The basis of delegation 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 The idea of empowerment and delegation is fine in theory. But if managers are still held accountable for perfor-
mance of staff and any adverse consequences of their actions, it is only right that they should exercise close control 
and supervision over their behaviour. 
 What is YOUR point of view? How comfortable do YOU feel about empowerment and delegation?

 Management and organisational behaviour in action case study 
 The police custody oﬃ  cer and empowerment 
 The police service has statutory responsibility for the treatment of persons detained by it (and other agencies, such 
as HMrc, that bring people into a police station). These people must be treated in accordance with the police & 
criminal evidence act 1984 (pace) that was enacted in January 1986 and any code of practice issued under the act. 
 section 39 of pace specifi es that these duties should be the duty of the custody offi  cer at a police station. The 
same section goes on to declare: 
 where an offi  cer of  higher rank than the custody offi  cer gives directions . . . which are at variance with any  decision  
or  action taken by the custody offi  cer in the performance of a duty imposed on him under this Act the matter  shall be 
referred at once to an offi  cer of the rank of Superintendent or above who is responsible for that police station.  
 There is statutory backing for the decisions and actions taken by custody officers in the performance of their duties. 
 pace sets out the provisions regarding the appointment of custody offi  cers (section 36). custody offi  cers are 
appointed to designated police stations, which are eff ectively police stations equipped to receive and house 
detained persons in the conditions that pace requires. subject to limited exceptions, all detained persons must go to 
a designated police station. custody offi  cers are appointed by the chief Offi  cer of police for that area or by an offi  cer 
directed by that chief Offi  cer of police to do so. importantly, no police offi  cer may be appointed a custody offi  cer 
unless at least the rank of sergeant, and signifi cantly none of the functions of a custody offi  cer shall be performed by 
an offi  cer who is involved in the investigation of an off ence for which the person is in detention (and there is case law 
that identifi es what being involved in an investigation entails). 
 Most forces have adopted the sergeant rank as the best suited to the custody offi  cer role (custody offi  cers no 
longer have to be a police offi  cer). On appointment, training is given in the role of sergeant and specifi cally custody-
offi  cer duties. custody offi  cers, though they work for the same organisation, have an element of impartiality through 
the statement that they must not be involved in the investigation of an off ence for which that person is detained. 
This allows for their decision-making to be non-partisan. There is an argument, perhaps, that for the decision-mak-
ing to be completely impartial, custody provisions should be independent of the police service, but in practice it is 
argued that custody offi  cers value their impartiality and their decision-making is refl ected in this. 
 The act clearly defi nes the process for any challenge to custody offi  cers’ decision-making and that is by appeal to 
the station commander, a superintendent. as well as providing support for custody offi  cers in their decision-making 
it also aff ords protection for them from  rank pulling in a hierarchically structured organisation such as the police. 
 custody offi  cers deal with people’s liberty and determine whether they enter the legal process by charging them 
to appear at court. This is a serious business and in practical terms it is taken very seriously. Their decision-making 
in this process is subject to periodic review. in the fi rst 24 hours of a person’s detention that review is undertaken at 
the 6-, 15- and 24-hour stages. any detention beyond 24 hours requires the authority of a superintendent and any 
detention beyond 36 hours requires a warrant from a court. The custody offi  cer’s decision-making is subject to close 
scrutiny through the training process, accreditation process and local inspection processes. Most importantly, it is a 
legal requirement now that all designated custody centres are videotaped, which is perhaps the ultimate scrutiny. 
The arrival of video recording tapes in custody centres was welcomed by custody offi  cers as it saw a corresponding 
fall in the number of complaints against them in the charge-room process. 
 in practical terms it is rare that decisions of a custody offi  cer are challenged by a more senior offi  cer (a detec-
tive chief inspector). The fact that these occasions are so rarely reported is evidence of the seriousness and profes-
sionalism adopted by custody sergeants in their decision-making process.  a process that would only work with 
empowerment.

Reasons for lack of delegation
Properly handled, delegation offers many potential benefits to both managers and staff. Del-
egation should help make the best use of time, provide a means of training and development 
and lead to improved morale by increasing motivation and job satisfaction. Effective delega-
tion results in optimum use of human resources and improved organisational performance.
With good reasons for delegation, why is it that managers often fail to delegate or do not 
delegate successfully? Delegation is influenced by the manager’s perception of subordinate 
staff. It is also influenced by the subordinate’s perception of the manager’s reasons for delega-
tion. Failure to delegate often results from the manager’s fear:
● The manager may fear that the subordinate is not capable of doing a sufficiently good job. 
Also, the manager may fear being blamed for the subordinate’s mistakes.
● Conversely, the manager may fear that the subordinate will do too good a job and show the 
manager in a bad light.
● The manager should, of course, remember that the task of management is to get work 
done through the efforts of other people. If the subordinate does a particularly good job 
this should reflect favourably on the manager. A reluctance to delegate might arise from the 
manager’s belief in, and set of assumptions about, human nature and behaviour, Theory X 
and Theory Y (discussed in Chapter 10).
Ethical considerations
Moorcroft suggests that although delegation is a useful business tool it needs only occasional 
use and is one that demands strong ethical issues, for example:
● managers may be overwhelmed with work but it is what they get paid to do;
● some larger consultancy companies may ‘sell’ the consultancy through senior staff but then 
send junior staff;
● use of the argument of ‘development of staff’ to delegate tasks beyond the level of the 
subordinate with an unrealistic time scale hoping that the subordinate will fail and thus 
reinforcing the status of the manager.
When delegation does occur it is important to establish ethical rules relating to agreement 
on responsibility for outcomes, effective training and recognising credit for success.43Mistakes 
will inevitably happen and the subordinate will need to be supported by the manager, and 
protected against unwarranted criticism. The acceptance of ultimate responsibility highlights 
the educational aspect of the manager’s job. The manager should view mistakes as part of the 
subordinate’s training and learning experience and an opportunity for further development: 
‘Even if mistakes occur, good managers are judged as much by their ability to manage them as 
by their successes.’44
Trust and empowerment
Empowerment is also a matter of confidence and trust – in both subordinates and the man-
ager’s own performance and system of delegation. In allowing freedom of action to subordi-
nates within agreed terms of reference and the limits of authority, managers must accept that 
subordinates may undertake delegated activities in a different manner from themselves. This is 
at the basis of the true nature of trust. However, learning to put trust in other people is one of 
the most difficult aspects of successful delegation for many managers, and some never learn it.
As Stewart points out, managers who think about what can be done only in terms of what 
they can do cannot be effective. Managing is not a solo activity.
Managers must learn to accept their dependence upon people. A key part of being a good 
manager is managing that dependence. Managers who say that they cannot delegate 
because they have poor staff may genuinely be unfortunate in the calibre of the staff that 

492
part 4 sTrUcTUre, sTraTegY and eFFecTiVeness
they have inherited or been given. More often this view is a criticism of themselves: a criticism 
either of their unwillingness to delegate when they could and should do so, or a criticism of 
their selection, training and development of their staff . 45 
 The process of empowerment entails the removal of constraints and the granting of autonomy 
for independent actions. As part of her discussion on the democratic enterprise,  Gratton refers 
to the importance of trust and power. 
 The re-appropriation of choice from senior members of the organization to individuals them-
selves implies trust on both parts, but particularly on the part of senior members. It is they who 
have to cede power to individual employees and to trust them to behave in an autonomous 
manner and make decisions and take action that serve their personal good and the good of 
the organization. Democracy implies the giving of authority to individuals to make choices 
within the context of obligations and accountabilities. Authority, obligations and account-
ability are deeply bound up with trust. Trust without accountability and obligation is likely to 
become one-sided, that is, to slide into dependence. Accountability without trust is impossible 
because it would mean the continual scrutiny of the motives and actions of individuals. 46 
 The indispensability trap 
 Jolly  comments on the ‘curse of knowledge’ – those individuals who have demonstrated tech-
nical expertise, worked hard and developed skills and competence. Your skill has become 
automatic, and when moving into management you are faced with supervising people who it’s 
obvious don’t know how to do what for you. If you have then managed to demonstrate your 
expertise and ability to supervise others, you are too good at your current job and risk getting 
stuck in it. You have become indispensable and too important to promote. To be an eff ective 
executive you need a strong desire and ability to control and this focus on control leads to 
‘I don’t have time to delegate’. Delegation feels like losing control and takes valuable time. 
Hence the instinct to control can increasingly become a liability rather than an asset. 
 If managers are going to avoid the trap of indispensability, we have to stand back from our 
day-to-day tasks and think. We have to create an environment where others can grow and 
be held responsible. We have to fi ght our instincts to control. 47 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 reasons for lack of effective delegation are easy to understand. it is faster and easier to do the work yourself and 
there is a reluctance to trust other people. The main problem is that few people are coached in the skills or art of 
delegation. 
 To what extent has YOUR course of study prepared YOU to be an effective delegator? 
 Systematic approach to empowerment 
and delegation 
 The manager must be on the lookout for subordinates who are more concerned with personal 
empire building than meeting stated organisational objectives and thus prevent a strong per-
sonality exceeding the limits of formal delegation. The manager must remain in control. We 
have said that delegation creates a special manager–subordinate relationship and this involves 
both the giving of trust and the retention of control. Control is, therefore, an integral part of 
the system of delegation. However, control should not be so close as to inhibit the eff ective 
operation or benefi ts of delegation. It is a question of balance. 

Chapter 13  Organisational control and power
493
In order to realise the full benefits of empowerment without loss of control, it is necessary 
to adopt a planned and systematic approach. Setting up a successful system of delegation 
involves examining five basic questions:
● How can I make better use of my time and expertise?
● What tasks could be performed better by other staff?
● What opportunities are there for staff to learn and develop by undertaking delegated tasks 
and responsibilities?
● How should increased responsibilities be implemented and to whom should they be given?
● What forms of monitoring control system would be most appropriate?
Delegation is not an irrevocable act and can always be withdrawn. In order to set up an effec-
tive system of delegation, subordinates should know exactly what is expected of them, what 
has to be achieved, the boundaries within which they have freedom of action and how far 
they can exercise independent decision-making. It is possible to identify six main stages in a 
planned and systematic approach to delegation (see Figure 13.6):
● Clarification of objectives and suitable patterns of organisation. Establish and define pol-
icies and procedures in order to provide a framework for the exercise of authority and 
acceptance of responsibility.
● Agreement on terms of reference and acceptance of authority and responsibility. Identify 
and agree role prescription and terms of reference, and areas of work in which responsible 
for achieving results. Emphasis should generally be placed on end results rather than a set 
of detailed instructions.
● Guidance, support and training, and patterns of communication. When subordinates have 
agreed and accepted the delegation, they should be properly briefed, given guidance and 
support and any necessary training. They should be advised where, and to whom, they 
could go for further advice or help.
figure 13.6  Main stages in the process of delegation

494
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
● Effective monitoring and review procedures. Agree time limits (such as a target date for 
completion of a specific task or a specified time period), level and nature of supervision, 
and establish a system to monitor progress and provide feedback.
● Freedom of action within agreed terms of reference. One of the most frustrating aspects 
of delegation is the manager who passes on authority but stays close behind keeping a con-
stant watch over subordinates’ actions. The true nature of successful delegation means that 
the subordinate is left alone to get on with the job and given freedom of action within the 
boundaries established and agreed in the previous stages.
● Related reward system. Wherever possible, the process of delegation should be related 
to some form of associated ‘reward’ system. Examples could include bonus payments, 
improved job satisfaction, reduction of work stress and enhanced opportunities for promo-
tion or personal development, including further delegation.
A summary of delegation, authority, power and responsibility is given in the concept map 
set out in Figure 13.7.
Does empowerment deliver?
Effectively managed, empowerment can offer a number of potential benefits throughout all 
levels of the organisation. But does empowerment promote greater motivation and increase 
job satisfaction and work performance? Does empowerment deliver?
Wall and Wood suggest that although few manufacturing companies empower their staff, 
research shows that empowerment can be one of the most effective tools in raising both pro-
ductivity and profit. Empowerment improves performance because of the opportunities it pro-
vides for staff to do their work more effectively. It develops individuals’ knowledge so they take 
a broader and more proactive orientation towards their job and are more willing to suggest 
new ways of doing things and to engage in meaningful teamworking.48
Findings from a Whitehall II study of over 10,000 civil servants on work-related stress sug-
gests that giving people more control over their jobs can greatly benefit their health.49
Control versus autonomy
Whatever the extent of employee empowerment, there is still a requirement for some form of 
management control and this gives rise to a number of important behavioural considerations. 
From their study of top-performing companies in the 1990s, Goldsmith and Clutterbuck refer 
to the sharing of power, and to the balance between control and autonomy. They question how 
companies manage to balance giving people maximum freedom against exerting controls to 
ensure the benefits of size and a common sense of direction.
The way to exert the most effective control is to limit it to the few simple, readily understanda-
ble processes that have the greatest impact on group performance, and to maximise the free-
dom that managers at all levels have to achieve clear goals in their own way. And the more 
rigidly those core controls are enforced, the greater are the freedoms people need in order to 
compensate and to release their creativity, initiative and proactivity. Control and autonomy 
are therefore two sides of the same coin . . . What do we mean by control and autonomy? 
Formal control seems to be exercised in three main ways: through setting or agreeing targets 
for performance (mainly but not exclusively financial); through measurement and reporting 
systems; and through certain decisions to be made centrally or corporately. Autonomy is, in 
essence, an absence of formal control: once clear goals are set, the individual manager has 
greater or lesser freedom to determine how they will be met. There are still controls in place, 
but they are much less obvious or intrusive.50

 Critical review and refl ection 
 some form of hierarchical power and order is an essential feature of effective work performance, but the nature of 
modern organisations has noticeably diminished effective management control over the actions and behaviour of 
people at work. 
 What is YOUR considered opinion? Do YOU favour more or less control over your work activities? 
  1  give your own views on the controversial nature of management control. what do you see as the purpose and 
operation of control in work organisations? 
  2  detail, with supporting examples, the essential elements of a management control system. 
  3  explain fully the main factors that are likely to aff ect resistance to, and the successful implementation of, man-
agement control systems. 
 Review and discussion questions 
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  control completes the cycle of managerial activities and its purpose is improvement in perfor-
mance at both the individual and organisational level. 
  2  By its very nature, control is concerned with the regulation of behaviour. control has an emotive 
connotation and most people show ambivalence towards control.  
  3  control is an expression of managerial behaviour. There are important elements and charac-
teristics of eff ective control systems, and of forms and strategies of control. 
  4  work organisations are not just systems of hierarchical structure; they are complex systems of 
social relationships, status and power. 
  5   power is real or perceived control or infl uence over other people. it diff ers according to how 
members of staff  comply and operate at diff erent levels. 
  6   pluralistic approaches recognise power as a social process that derives from a multiplicity of 
interpersonal sources, social relationships and realities of organisational life. 
  7  control systems are frequently thought of in terms of accounting or fi nancial systems, but what 
also needs to be considered are social and behavioural factors. 
  8   discussion on the balance between order and fl exibility draws attention to the importance of 
empowerment and delegation and greater freedom for staff . 
  9   delegation creates a special manager–subordinate relationship based on entrusting authority 
and responsibility to others, but accountability cannot be delegated. 
  10   whatever the extent of employee empowerment, there is still need for some form of manage-
ment control and there are a number of behavioural considerations. 

CHAPTER 13 ORGANISATIONAL CONTROL AND POWER
497
  4  Discuss critically the use of technology as a determinant of an eﬀ ective control system, including any legal or 
social considerations. 
  5  Debate the extent to which you believe too much attention is given to ﬁ nancial and accounting systems of con-
trol at the expense of behavioural considerations. 
  6  Explain fully the importance of the concept of power to management and organisational behaviour. 
  7  Discuss critically the nature of pluralistic approaches to power and give your own practical examples. 
  8  How would you explain the organisational and personal relationships between a manager and subordinate staﬀ  
created by the process of empowerment? 
  9  As a departmental manager, explain fully how you would attempt to realise the full advantages of delegation 
without loss of control over subordinate staﬀ . 
  10  Discuss critically what you see as the likely consequences of a manager exercising close personal supervision as 
a means of maintaining control and power over the work of subordinate staﬀ . 
 Assignment  The empowerment questionnaire 
 The following questionnaire consists of managerial behaviours that promote empowerment. Think of any work 
experience you have had – even a short-term, vacation or part-time job. How frequently did your manager do each 
of the following? Please mark the response that best describes the manager’s behaviour.

 a.  if this was  not  a permanent, full-time position, to what extent do you think this infl uenced your manager’s 
behaviour towards you? 
 b.  How did your experience compare with the manager’s behaviour to other members of staff  in the same 
department/section? 
 c.  How would you describe the manager’s general belief in, and approach to, empowerment? and what was your 
perception of the manager’s overall eff ectiveness? 
 Objectives 
 completing this exercise should help you to enhance the following skills: 
 ●  review honestly and refl ect upon features of your own personality. 
 ●  assess the extent to which you are in danger of becoming a control freak. 
 ●  sensitivity to your preferred managerial style. 
 control in its many forms is an inherent and essential feature of management and organisational behaviour. How-
ever, the manner in which control is exercised is a variable dependent upon the extent to which a manager either 
prefers or believes it necessary to use positional power within the hierarchical structure of the organisation to main-
tain control. For some people, power can be a positive source of motivation. 
 Exercise 
 working in small, self-selected groups, individually record honestly the extent to which you agree with the following 
ten questions. if necessary, think how you would be likely to behave in a given situation. Then compare and discuss 
responses with your colleagues.

CHAPTER 13 ORGANISATIONAL CONTROL AND POWER
499
  1  I enjoy and strive for power over other people. It is a natural human characteristic. 
  2  I am generally happy to put my trust in others to get work done on time and to a good standard. 
  3  Charisma and personal power is the most eﬀ ective source of management control. 
  4  I am happy to accept that other people often have better ideas than me. 
  5  It is only natural for managers to expect obedience based on their formal hierarchical authority. 
  6  Oﬃ  ce politics, manipulation and the grapevine should be accepted as realities of organisational life. 
  7  I believe that I am right most of the time. 
  8  Control over members of staﬀ  through electronic surveillance is nothing more than an unwelcome invasion 
of privacy. 
  9  Financial and accounting systems are the most reliable and fairest forms of control. 
  10  The concept of empowerment sounds good in theory but far too often delegation is abused by managers 
for their own beneﬁ t. 
 Discussion 
 ●  Do you think you have controlling issues or can you exercise ﬂ exibility? 
 ●  How can you attempt to develop charisma and the use of personal power? 
 ●  To what extent has this exercise provoked further thoughts on your attitude towards organisational control 
and power? 
 Over the last three decades rogue traders in the ﬁ nan-
cial services sector have provided a dramatic illustration 
of the major risks that can result from poor organisa-
tional control. The term denotes an individual whose 
wayward and/or fraudulent activities at the trading desk 
have built up very high losses for the bank. Rogue trad-
ers usually ﬁ nd ways of hiding the escalating losses from 
sight, meaning that the collapse, when it ﬁ nally comes, 
can be very damaging. 
 Perhaps because of the dizzying scale of the losses 
they create, rogue traders can become individually 
famous: Nick Leeson (Barings), Jerome Kerviel (Societé 
Générale) and Kweku Adoboli (UBS) are probably better 
known in the media than any of the senior managers 
in their institutions. The punishments handed down for 
their wrongdoing can be heavy: Leeson was sentenced 
to six and a half years in jail. Kerviel received a sentence 
of ﬁ ve years in prison (of which two were suspended); 
he was eventually released from prison in September 
2014, having served about ﬁ ve months, and will wear an 
electronic tag for the rest of his sentence. 51 Adoboli was 
sentenced to seven years in prison in 2012. 52 One of the 
more remarkable characteristics of these traders is that 
they seem not to be seeking to embezzle money from 
their employer, or to cause deliberate damage to the 
bank. 53 They may well trade in the hope of large bonus 
payments in a good year – that is the culture in trading 
ﬂ oors – but when they go rogue, it is more likely to be 
in a desperate eﬀ ort to recover a large and embarrassing 
loss resulting from foolish trading or just plain bad luck. 
 Nick Leeson’s story (back in 1995) has many features 
in common with more recent scandals in Japan, France 
and Switzerland, although today’s greater complexity of 
ﬁ nancial products and the much more globalised nature 
of the market may well have increased the risk. Leeson 
was employed as a trader in the Singapore branch of

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Barings Bank, a long-established London institution. 
As the son of a plasterer from a Watford council estate, 
his successful track record in the early 1990s must have 
looked at the time like a classic rags-to-riches story,54 
very much in line with the values of the recently liber-
alised City of London. In 1992, at the age of just 26, he 
was put in charge of a new Barings venture in futures 
trading – in effect, making money by correctly anticipat-
ing the movement of indices in key stock exchanges. He 
appeared to be highly successful in this role: in 1993, 
the £10 million profit from his operation represented 10 
per cent of Barings’ total profits.55 Not surprisingly, his 
rewards from the bank grew rapidly, funding an extrava-
gant lifestyle. The problems started when an inexperi-
enced member of his team made a relatively modest loss 
as a result of a trading mistake, which Leeson decided to 
cover up by hiding it in a secret account. This was only 
possible because Leeson was in charge of both the front 
and back offices of his operation: in other words, he both 
carried out the trades and settled them, which turned out 
to be a key structural flaw in the controls applied by his 
employer. Once open, the secret account was available 
for hiding further losses, a habit that grew rapidly – by 
the end of 1994, the account contained losses of more 
than £200 million. As the unseen problem grew, Leeson 
requested further funds from his London headquarters, 
hoping to set up successful large trades that would wipe 
out the accumulated losses.56 This desperate ‘doubling 
up’ of risk will be familiar to gamblers, but in this context 
the risk is magnified to catastrophic levels. Arguably, the 
edifice would have come crashing down sooner or later, 
but in this case the fatal damage was done on 17 Janu-
ary 1995 by the effects of the Kobe earthquake on the 
Japanese stock markets, on which Leeson had made a 
very large bet the day before. The rest of the story can 
be summarised quickly. The losses in the secret account 
quickly grew to more than £800 million and by the end 
of February 1995, some 233 years after its foundation, 
Barings was declared insolvent (the remains of the bank 
were taken over by the Dutch bank ING). Leeson disap-
peared, but was later found, arrested and sent back to 
Singapore, where he was tried and sentenced to jail.
Anyone can do it . . . 
A number of writers have commented on the similar-
ity between rogue trader episodes in different institu-
tions. John Gapper57 discusses research in psychology 
that shows how animals are more likely to gamble when 
under some form of stress: in more secure times, a low-
risk choice is preferred. Human behaviour shows similar 
tendencies, together with a disproportionate inability 
to accept the discomfort of a loss. In a high-pressure 
environment like a trading floor, with the prospect of 
very high rewards for success and abrupt penalties for 
loss, it seems reasonable to speculate that the employ-
ing institution may – no doubt inadvertently – create a 
climate that can play a part in a rogue trader’s headlong 
rush into disaster. A report by Aditya Chakrabortty in the 
Guardian58 offered a guide to rogue trading, including 
the following suggestions:
● Anyone can do it – no special genius seems to be 
required.
● Come from the ‘wrong’ background – unlike high-
fliers from the top universities, both Leeson and Ker-
viel came up through back-office experience, which 
later helped them to find and exploit weaknesses in 
control systems.
● Work on the newest (and so least well-understood) 
financial products.
A similar point is made by Gapper’s quote from the 
advice given to its bank clients by a risk consultancy:59
Do you employ a likeable twenty-eight year old male 
index derivatives trader who has been promoted to the 
trading floor? Does he have a good understanding of 
your back- and middle-office systems, including where 
the weaknesses are? Does he have a decent finance- 
or business-related degree from a good (but not top 
end) university? If so, go and take a closer look at 
what he’s doing.
Gapper also suggests that rogue traders seem to be 
much more likely to emerge in banks with a retail or 
commercial banking background that are relatively new 
to the world of investment banking/trading and are try-
ing to make their mark in this new and unfamiliar world. 
As he suggested in his 2012 book, the major Wall Street 
investment banks have been largely unscathed by these 
problems over the last two decades.
However, in 2013 leading US bank JP Morgan was 
severely criticised by the US Senate in respect of large 
losses incurred following very large trades made in 
its London office,60 not least because the problems 
appeared to be systemic, rather than exclusively to do 
with a rogue trader.61 Any such impression might have 
been reinforced by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) report in 2014 on the attempts by staff in six major 
banks to manipulate foreign exchange rates: the FCA 
report includes transcripts of crudely exultant messages 
between traders, sometimes even in collusion with trad-
ers in other institutions.

Chapter 13  Organisational control and power
501
A similar point was made by the author of an article 
in the magazine Rolling Stone62 in 2011, which criticised 
the use of the term ‘rogue trader’ by the industry and 
suggested that the problems are more deep-seated than 
just a few reckless young men:
In the financial press you’re called a ‘rogue trader’ if 
you’re some overperspired 28 year-old newbie who 
bypasses internal audits and quality control to make 
a disastrous trade that could sink the company. But if 
you’re a well-groomed 60 year-old CEO who uses his 
authority to ignore quality control and internal audits 
in order to make disastrous trades that could sink 
the company, you get a bailout, a bonus, and heroic 
treatment.
The employer’s control systems are the key to minimising 
the risk of rogue trading, as regards both their design and 
their operation. Financial products are becoming more 
complex and systems more sophisticated, so that chal-
lenge grows in importance with each passing year. As the 
crisis of 2008 made chillingly clear, major global banks are 
strongly interlinked, to the extent that one bank’s major 
embarrassment can easily become everyone’s problem.
 Tasks

	 2	 Explain which of the six strategies of organisational control in Figure 13.3 appear to be used on the trading 
floors of investment banks.
	 3	 Leeson and others were able to do the damage they did because they were both competent and trusted.

 the most successful and enduring organisations are also those that give the greatest attention to the well-being of 
their staff and to their broader social and ethical responsibilities. 
 To what extent do YOU agree? What examples can YOU quote to support YOUR view? What would YOU say about 
YOUR university or organisation? 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the overall direction of an organisation is determined by the 
nature of its corporate strategy. Strategy links structure, the process 
of management and applications of organisational behaviour. 
organisations play a major and increasingly important role in the lives 
of us all and have a responsibility to multiple stakeholders. the power 
and infl uence of a business organisation must be tempered by decisions 
relating to its broader social obligations and ethical responsibilities.

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
The importance of strategy
Underlying the effective management of people is the requirement for a clear understand-
ing of the nature of the business that the organisation is engaged in and how best to pro-
vide customer or consumer satisfaction. We saw earlier (Chapter 3) that the context of the 
organisational setting is central to the application of organisational behaviour and the pro-
cess of management. It is the interaction of people in order to achieve objectives that forms 
the basis of the particular organisation. An integral feature of the study of organisational 
behaviour is an understanding of the nature of corporate strategy for the formal organisa-
tion as a whole.
What is strategy?
Definitions of strategy vary. For example Johnson et al. view strategy in simple terms as about 
key issues for the future of organisations and the long-term direction of an organisation.1 
Some writers distinguish different terms and various levels of ‘strategy’, but corporate strategy  
is seen here as a generic term relating to the underlying purpose of the organisation and 
embracing links among structure, the process of management and applications of organisa-
tional behaviour. For some writers, such as Andrews, ‘strategic management’ is emerging as a 
more popular term than corporate strategy.
Strategic management is the pattern of major objectives, purposes or goals and essential poli-
cies or plans for achieving those goals, stated in such a way as to define what business the 
company is in or is to be in and the kind of company it is or is to be.2
Strategy and structure
There is obviously a close relationship between strategy and organisation structure (discussed 
in Chapter 11). It is by means of the organisation’s structure that its goals and objectives are 
attained. Lynch suggests that the nature of this relationship, and whether structure follows 
strategy or strategy follows structure, is not clear.
A major debate has been taking place over the last 30 years regarding the relationship 
between the strategy and the structure of the organisation. In the past, it was considered 
that the strategy was decided first and the organisation structure then followed . . . Recent 
research has questioned this approach and taken the view that strategy and structure are 
interrelated . . . Although it may not be possible to define which comes first, there is a need 
to ensure that strategy and structure are consistent with each other.3
Strategy and people
Allen and Helms suggest that different types of reward practices may more closely comple-
ment different generic strategies and are significantly related to higher levels of perceived 
organisational performance.4 According to Stern, it seems acceptable again to acknowledge 
the human factor in business: ‘Niceness is back in vogue, at least for some of the time. People 
are talking about strategy not just in visionary terms but also in emotional ones.’5 Gratton 
draws attention to people at the centre of business success and the importance of people-
centred strategies.
Creating people-centred strategies is one of the means by which the organization balances 
the needs of the short term with those of the long term, as well as balancing financial capital 
with human potential. Creative and engaging people strategies have, at their core, an under-
standing of how the vision and business goals can be delivered through people, and of the 
specific actions which need to be taken in the short and longer term to bridge from reality to 
aspirations.6

 Strategy and culture 
 Schneider and Barsoux discuss the close link between culture and strategy and address such 
questions as: how does national culture aff ect strategy; how do diff erent approaches to strat-
egy refl ect diff erent underlying cultural assumptions; how do managers from diff erent cultures 
respond to similar business environments; and in what ways does culture aff ect the content 
and process of decision-making? Among the examples quoted by Schneider and Barsoux are 
Japanese companies that challenge the Western view of strategic management and adopt a 
broader notion of strategy; managers from Nordic and Anglo countries who are less likely to 
see environments as uncertain; and managers from countries within Latin Europe or Asia who 
are likely to perceive greater uncertainty when faced with similar environments and perceive 
less control over what will happen. 7 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Understandably, much attention is given to the importance of corporate strategy but not enough attention is nor-
mally given to the human factor or how the strategy impacts on people in the organisation. 
 To what extent can YOU identify with the strategy of YOUR university and/or organisation and how does it impact 
on YOUR actions or behaviour? 
 Organisational goals 
 The activities of the organisation are directed to the attainment of its goals. A goal is a 
future expectation, some desired future state, something the organisation is striving to 
accomplish. Goals are therefore an important feature of work organisations.  Organisational 
goals are more specifi c than the function of an organisation. Goals will determine the nature 
of its inputs and outputs, the series of activities through which the outputs are achieved and 
interactions with its external environment. The extent to which an organisation is success-
ful in attaining its goals is a basis for the evaluation of organisational performance and 
eff ectiveness. 
 To be eff ective, goals should be emphasised, stated clearly and communicated to all mem-
bers of the organisation. At the individual level, the attainment of goals is the underlying 
infl uence on motivation. Movement towards greater delegation and empowerment through 
the hierarchy means that staff  at all levels must be aware of their key tasks and actions, and 
exactly what is expected of them and their department/section. For example, goal-setting the-
ory  (discussed in  Chapter  7 ) is widely recognised as a successful means of increasing work 
motivation and performance. 8 
 According to  Reeves, a few well-chosen aims in goal-setting can sharpen focus and boost 
productivity, but too many can lead to stress and even disaster. Clear objectives expressed as 
specifi c goals should improve performance, but measurement should not be confused with tar-
get-setting, and problems occur when there are too many targets and they are closely attached 
to individual performance. 
 The more freedom an individual has over the way their job is done, the higher the produc-
tivity and the bigger the rewards reaped by the fi rm for which they work. People need to 
know the objectives of their organisation and how their performance contributes to them. 
Employee engagement is much more likely to follow from autonomy than from a battery of 
management-dictated targets. 9 

506
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Objectives and policy
In addition to performing some function, all organisations have some incentive for their exist-
ence and for their operations. The goals of the organisation are translated into objectives and 
policy. Use of the two terms varies but objectives are seen here as the ‘what’ and policy as the 
‘how’, ‘where’ and ‘when’ – the means that follow the objectives:
● Objectives set out more specifically the goals of the organisation, the aims to be achieved 
and the desired end results.
● Policy is developed within the framework of objectives. It provides the basis for decision-
making and the course of action to follow in order to achieve objectives.
Choice of objectives is an essential part of corporate strategy and the decision-making pro-
cess involving future courses of action. Objectives may be just implicit, but formal, explicit 
definition will assist communications and reduce misunderstandings, and provide more 
meaningful criteria for evaluating organisational performance. Clearly stated, good objec-
tives can help provide unity of direction and aid employee engagement and commitment. 
However, objectives should not be stated in such a way that they detract from the recognition 
of possible new opportunities, potential danger areas, the initiative of staff or the need for 
innovation or change.
Policy is a guideline for organisational action and the implementation of goals and objec-
tives. Policy is translated into rules, plans and procedures; it relates to all activities of the 
organisation and all levels of the organisation. Clearly stated, policy can help reinforce main 
functions of the organisation, make for consistency and reduce dependency on actions of indi-
vidual managers. Policy clarifies roles and responsibilities of managers and other members 
of staff and provides guidelines for managerial behaviour. Some policy decisions are directly 
influenced by external factors – for example, government legislation on equal opportunities 
and diversity.
Corporate guidelines
Whatever the type of organisation, formulation of objectives and policy is a necessary func-
tion in every organisation and an integral part of the process of management. In terms of a 
systems approach, the objectives of an organisation are related to the input–conversion–out-
put cycle. In order to achieve its objectives and satisfy its goals, the organisation takes inputs 
from the environment, through a series of activities transforms or converts these inputs into 
outputs and returns them to the environment as inputs to other systems. The organisation 
operates within a dynamic setting and success in achieving its goals will be influenced by a 
multiplicity of interactions with the environment (see Figure 14.1).
Together, objectives and policy provide corporate guidelines for the operations and man-
agement of the organisation. Clearly defined and agreed objectives are the first stage in the 
design of organisation structure and help facilitate systems of interaction and communication 
between different parts of the organisation. A commonly used mnemonic to summarise the 
characteristics of good objectives is ‘SMART’:
Specific – clear, detailed and understandable as to what is required
Measurable – to monitor and measure progress towards achievement of the objective
Achievable – challenging but obtainable by a competent person
Realistic – relevant to the goals of the organisation with a focus on outcomes of achievement
Timebound – outcomes to be achieved within an agreed time scale.
But note the observations from Dryburgh:

Chapter 14  Strategy, corporate responsibility and ethics

Organisational ideologies and principles
The goals of the organisation may be pursued in accordance with an underlying ideology, or 
philosophy, based on beliefs, values and attitudes. This organisational ideology determines the 
‘culture’ of the organisation and provides a set of principles that govern the overall conduct 
of the organisation’s operations, codes of behaviour, the management of people and dealings 
figure 14.1  A systems view of organisational goals and objectives
Why SMART objectives are really DUMB
Alastair Dryburgh
We have all read about how objectives should be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timed. This 
is well meaning but profoundly limiting. Let’s take the points one by one and see where they lead us.
● Specific. Why is this a good thing, when it excludes objectives such as ‘insanely great technology’ (Apple), ‘a totally 
new way of seeing’ (Picasso) or ‘customer service that gets customers raving about how good it is’ (anyone? I wish 
someone would)?
● Measurable. Same problem as specific. Mediocrity is easy to measure, but greatness is harder – you know it when 
you see it.
● Achievable and Realistic. This is where the real problem occurs. I don’t know, cannot know, how much I can achieve. If 
I want to set myself a goal that I know I can achieve, I have to set something that is much less than I could achieve. That’s 
a recipe for mediocrity, at best. The worst thing that can happen with such a goal is that we do meet it, and we stop short 
of what we could have achieved. Consider instead the value of an impossible goal like ‘be the world’s greatest X’. It helps 
and inspires us. It sets a direction. We may never get there, but every day we know what to do to move closer.
● Timed. This creates the dangerous illusion that we make changes in order to arrive at a steady state at some defined 
point in the future. That’s not how the world works – it keeps changing, and we need to keep changing with it.
SMART objectives are part of an obsolete management paradigm that assumes that we know what the future will look 
like (much like the present) and know how we will survive and thrive in that future. If Mother Nature had used SMART 
objectives instead of natural selection, we would still be no more than slightly improved monkeys.10

with other organisations. 11 These sets of principles may be recognised and implemented infor-
mally as ‘accepted conventions’ of the organisation or they may be stated formally in writing. 
 Forty years ago,  Brech wrote about the ideology of an organisation related to the idea of 
both an ethical foundation and an organisational or operational foundation: 
 ●  Ethical foundation embodies the basic principles that govern the external and internal rela-
tions of the organisation. External relations concern standards of fair trading and relations 
with, for example, customers, suppliers and the general public. Internal relations are con-
cerned with fair standards of employment and relations with members of the organisation, 
including authorised union representatives. 
 ●  Organisational or operational foundation is concerned with the structure, operation and 
conduct of the activities of the organisation. External aspects relate to, for example, meth-
ods of trading and channels of distribution. Internal aspects include methods of produc-
tion, use of equipment and managerial practices relating to organisational performance, 
productivity and profi tability. 12 
 In recent years organisations have given growing attention to a set of stated corporate values 
displayed prominently for all to see.  Lucas questions whether such grand statements of corpo-
rate principles really mean anything and concludes that they actually have a point and values 
can be used with success: ‘A set of values is obviously a nice thing for an organisation to have; 
something to pin on the notice board. But for those organisations that have learned to walk 
the talk, deeply embedded values can attract the right people, underpin the business in times 
of crisis and provide direction for the future.’ 13 
 Cloke and Goldsmith contend that organisations can increase their integrity, coherence and 
integration, and improve their performance by reaching consensus on shared values. They can 
bolster value-based relationships by recognising and encouraging behaviours that uphold their 
values; communicate and publicise their values, and encourage individual and team responsi-
bility for implementing them; and develop methods for monitoring compliance with values, 
providing feedback and identifying potential confl icts of interest. Most importantly, consensus 
on shared values means organisations can accomplish these goals without moralising, preach-
ing, excusing or imposing their values on others. 14 
 An organisation’s ‘signature’ ideology 
 Certain aspects of an organisation’s philosophy may be so dominant that they become the 
‘hallmark’ of that organisation and place constraints on other areas or forms of activities. For 
example, the highest-quality hallmark of Rolls-Royce cars would presumably prevent entry 
into the cheaper mass-production market. With the Walt Disney Company, quality service is 
embedded deeply within its corporate culture. 
 Gratton refers to ‘signature’ processes of highly successful companies that are a direct 
embodiment of the history and values of the company and its top executive team, and their 
potential to create the energy to drive high performance. These signature processes, which 
diff er signifi cantly from general views of best practice, are acceptable within the companies 
in which they develop because of their association with the passion and value of the executive 
team, and are part of the fabric and ways of behaving. 15 A clear example of the point made by 
Gratton is Apple, with a signature that has survived the ultimate demise of its founder. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Successful and enduring organisations may well have a clear ideology and idealistic motivation but members of staff 
are more likely to be committed to the goals and performance of the organisation by job security, high wages and 
good working conditions. 
 To what extent do YOU think core ideology and shared values are the hallmark of a successful organisation? Can YOU 
identify with the idea of a core ideology in YOUR university? 

Chapter 14  Strategy, corporate responsibility and ethics 
509
Vision and mission statements
It has become increasingly popular for an organisation to produce a mission statement and/or 
its ‘vision’ that sets out the purpose and general direction for the organisation. There is some-
times an apparent uncertainty over the distinction between the terms ‘mission’ and ‘vision’, 
which tend to be used interchangeably. It seems to be generally accepted that the vision pro-
vides the overall frame of reference of what the organisation would like to reach and how 
it will look. Within this vision the mission statement defines what the organisation aims to 
achieve, and its core business and activities.
Value of mission statements
The desire to identify with as many stakeholders as possible means that many mission state-
ments are all-embracing with bland and abstract wording. The value of a mission statement 
is dependent, however, upon the extent to which it is understood and accepted throughout the 
organisation, and translated in meaningful terms to all members of staff including those at 
the operational level. A mission statement is only likely to be of any value if the organisation 
actually practises what it preaches. The purpose (strategy) and guiding principles of the John 
Lewis Partnership are set out below.
● Purpose – The Partnership’s ultimate purpose is the happiness of all its members, through their worthwhile and 
satisfying employment in a successful business. Because the Partnership is owned in trust for its members, they 
share the responsibilities of ownership as well as its rewards of profit, knowledge and power.
● Power – Our Partners are able to influence their business at all levels of the Partnership through the democratic 
structure and the representative bodies which are defined in our constitution. Power in the Partnership is shared 
between three governing authorities: the Partnership Council, the Partnership Board and the Chairman.
● Profit – The Partnership aims to make sufficient profit from its trading operations to sustain its commercial vitality 
and finance its continued development, to enable it to undertake other activities consistent with its ultimate pur-
pose and to distribute a share of those profits each year to its members. Our success relies on the collaboration 
and contribution of our Partners who receive a share of profits in the form of Partnership Bonus.
● Knowledge – We provide our Partners with the knowledge they need to carry out their responsibilities effectively 
as co-owners of the Partnership.
● Members – The Partnership aims to employ people of ability and integrity who are committed to working 
together and to supporting its Principles. Relationships are based on mutual respect and courtesy, with as much 
equality between its members as differences of responsibility permit. The Partnership aims to recognise their 
individual contributions and reward them fairly.
● Customers – The Partnership aims to deal honestly with its customers and secure their loyalty and trust by pro-
viding outstanding choice, value and service.
● Business relationships – The Partnership aims to conduct all its business relationships with integrity and courtesy 
and to honour scrupulously every business agreement.
● The community – The Partnership aims to obey the spirit as well as the letter of the law and to contribute to the 
wellbeing of the communities where it operates.
The John Lewis Partnership – defining principles
The profit objective – not a sufficient criterion
For business organisations, the objective of profit maximisation is undoubtedly of great impor-
tance but it is not, by itself, a sufficient criterion for effective management. There are many 
other considerations and motivations that influence assumptions underlying the economic 

510
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
theory of the firm. The meaning of ‘profit maximisation’ is not, by itself, very clear. Consid-
eration has to be given to the range and quality of an organisation’s products or services, and 
to environmental influences. Reducing attention to longer-term ‘investments’, such as quality 
and after-sales service, research and development, sales promotion, management development 
and employment conditions of staff, may increase profitability in the short term but is likely 
to jeopardise future growth and development, and possibly even the ultimate survival of the 
organisation.
This argument can be clarified to some extent by redefining the business goal as the maxi-
misation of owner (shareholder) value, instead of ‘profit’. The concept of value is defined as 
incorporating the short, medium and long term through the process of discounting (reducing 
the value of) future cash flows back to a present value. Thus managers seeking to maximise 
value have good reason to make investments in business activities that will yield profit in the 
future, even if the costs are immediate and the benefits are some years away.
A business organisation has to provide some commodity or service by which it contributes 
to the economic and/or social needs of the community. It also has broader social responsibili-
ties to society (discussed later below). Profit can be seen as the incentive for an organisation to 
carry out its activities effectively. Profit does at least provide some broad measure of effective-
ness and highlights the difficulty in evaluating the effectiveness of not-for-profit organisations, 
such as NHS hospitals, prisons or universities.
Fallacy of the single objective
The reality is that managers are usually faced with the challenge of several, often competing 
and/or conflicting objectives. Drucker has referred to the fallacy of the single objective of a 
business. The search for the one, right objective is not only unlikely to be productive, but also 
certain to harm and misdirect the business enterprise.
To emphasize only profit, for instance, misdirects managers to the point where they may 
endanger the survival of the business. To obtain profit today they tend to undermine the 
future . . . To manage a business is to balance a variety of needs and goals . . . the 
very nature of business enterprise requires multiple objectives which are needed in every area 
where performance and results directly and vitally affect the survival and prosperity of the 
business.16
Drucker goes on to suggest eight key areas in which objectives should be set in terms of per-
formance and results:
	1.	 Market standing – for example, share of market standing; range of products and markets; 
distribution; pricing; customer loyalty and satisfaction.
	2.	 Innovation – for example, innovations to reach marketing goals; developments arising from 
technological advancements; new processes and improvements in major areas of organisa-
tional activity.
	3.	 Productivity – for example, optimum use of resources; use of techniques such as opera-
tional research to help decide alternative courses of action; the ratio of ‘contributed value’ 
to total revenue.
	4.	 Physical and financial resources – such as plant, machines, offices and replacement of 
facilities; supply of capital and budgeting; planning for the money needed; provision of 
supplies.
	5.	 Profitability – for example, profitability forecasts and anticipated time scales; capital invest-
ment policy; yardsticks for measurement of profitability.
	6.	 Manager performance and development – for example, the direction of managers and set-
ting up their jobs; the structure of management; the development of future managers.
	7.	 Worker performance and attitude – for example, union relations; the organisation of work; 
employee relations.
	8.	 Public responsibility – for example, demands made upon the organisation, such as by law 
or public opinion; responsibilities to society and the public interest.

511
 Organisational values and behaviour 
 Gidoomal maintains that we have taken it for granted that the ethical values and norms of 
society are there but they need to be spelled out. 
  It’s almost a pity to say we need training in ethics. We should be brought up with it through 
the education system and the values taught at home and church. When you learn ethics and 
values as a kid you have learnt them for life. We have to be proud of our integrity and blow 
the whistle when things don’t go right. 
 Gidoomal also maintains that the ethical business dimension cannot be separated from 
the diversity issue  (discussed in  Chapter  4 ) and, while acknowledging that more and more 
companies now have diversity policies, wonders if they are just lying on a shelf gathering 
dust. 17  
 The Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators draws attention to the impor-
tance of creating a culture of integrity and raising awareness of the benefi ts of ethical behav-
iour within organisations. 
  Ethical behaviour touches every part of the organisation . . . in terms of a licence to operate 
such as Health and Safety, to control for example anti-bribery laws, and the most important 
piece – creating a culture with the expectation that you will do it right. 18 
 Ethical leadership 
 The importance of ethical behaviour, integrity and trust calls into question the extent to which 
managers should attempt to change the underlying values and beliefs of individual followers. 
 (See discussion on transformational leadership in  Chapter  10 .) For example,  Yukl discusses 
the controversy whereby some writers contend that this type of leader infl uence is clearly 
unethical even when intended to benefi t followers as well as the organisation. A contrary view 
is that leaders have an important responsibility to implement major changes when necessary 
to ensure survival and eff ectiveness. Large-scale change would not be successful without some 
changes in member beliefs and perceptions. 
 The traditional perspective is that managers in business organizations are agents who repre-
sent the interest of the owners in achieving economic success for the organization. From this 
perspective, ethical leadership is satisfi ed by maximizing economic outcomes that benefi t 
owners while not doing anything strictly prohibited by laws and moral standards . . . A very 
diff erent perspective is that managers should serve multiple stakeholders inside and outside 
the organization. 19  
 According to a recent report from the Institute of Leadership and Management, despite 
the high level of public focus on ethics, managers are still placed under increased pressure 
from facing frequent ethical dilemmas at work. Although the majority of managers say their 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the single, most important objective for the business organisation is profit maximisation, ideally combined with high 
monetary rewards for members of staff. this is the bottom line and the only realistic criterion by which organisa-
tional effectiveness can be judged. 
 How would YOU attempt to challenge this assertion? How would YOU define the single, most important objective for 
a non-profit organisation such as YOUR university? 

512
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
organisations have a statement of values, it is clear that they are not effective enough at influ-
encing behaviour. Values need to be linked with strategy.
Building a set of values that do not link with targets is an ineffective way to influence behav-
iour. If values are contrary or irrelevant to the business goals, managers find themselves pulled 
in different directions trying to achieve both. But when values tie into the strategic objectives 
of an organisation, the way people are expected to behave and the goals they are required to 
achieve work in tandem.20
The core values of Red Carnation Hotels are set out below.
Our core values reflect what is really important and matters to us as a company and group of individuals. They are 
the solid foundation and main principles of our company culture. By consistently working hard to maintain our 
values, we endeavour to preserve what makes Red Carnation Hotels so special – a sincere and deep commitment to 
each other, our guests whom we serve every day and the communities within which we work and live.
To give personalised, warm and consistently exceptional service We appreciate the myriad of choices and 
alternatives our customers have to choose from, and therefore set the bar high for ourselves, to provide the highest 
quality services and products we possibly can. We constantly challenge ourselves to update and enhance. Innova-
tion, constant training and refurbishment help create an environment whereby our guests and our employees refer

To value, respect and support each other We believe that care comes from caring and so provide a level of care 
for our team members that inspires by example, generates trust, respect, open and honest communication and 
appreciation.
To create positive, memorable experiences for every guest We work hard to meet or exceed our customers’ 
expectations on every visit or touch point they have with us. By delighting and satisfying our customers, we ensure 
the longevity of our business and employment for our team. By serving our customers with very personable, profi-
cient, friendly, competent service, and listening to their needs we create memorable and distinctive experiences as 
well as loyal, returning guests.
To care about and give back to our local communities We recognize and appreciate our responsibility to be 
active participants in our local communities. We believe in trying to also give of our time to community and service 
organizations. We believe that it is important to give something back and make a difference. In a world of shrinking 
natural resources, we must endeavour to conserve, reuse and care about those around us.
All of our hotels make it an ongoing priority to support and contribute positively to a variety of charitable orga-
nizations within their respective communities. The charities we support in England include The Starlight Foundation, 
Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, Action Against Hunger, the National Autistic Society and the Cystic Fibrosis 
Trust. In Geneva we have provided help for The Red Cross and in South Africa we support the Nelson Mandela Chil-
dren's Fund, and our bath amenities are purchased from Charlotte Rhys, a Founding Member of the Proudly South 
African Organisation, dedicated to the support of disadvantaged women and men in South Africa. Recycling efforts 
continue to be reviewed and improved upon wherever possible.
Our guests, staff, and suppliers have been wonderfully sympathetic to our aims, assisting us with their whole-
hearted support, and we would like to send a sincere ‘thank you’ to every one of them. While we believe our 
collective contributions do make a difference we are not content to sit back, and constantly challenge ourselves 
to increase our involvement with the global community. We welcome ideas and input from our customers, staff 
and suppliers.

   Corporate social responsibilities 
 Organisations play a major and increasingly important role in the lives of us all, especially 
with the growth of large-scale business and expanding globalisation. The decisions and 
actions of management in organisations have an increasing impact on individuals, other 
organisations and the community. Organisations make a contribution to the quality of 
life and to the well-being of the community. The power and infl uence that many business 
organisations now exercise should be tempered, therefore, by an attitude of responsibility by 
management. 
 Organisational survival is dependent upon a series of continual interactions and exchanges 
between the organisation and its environment that give rise to a number of broader responsi-
bilities to society in general. These broader responsibilities, which are both internal and exter-
nal to the organisation, are usually referred to as  corporate social responsibility (CSR). 
 Growing attention to social responsibilities 
 There has been growing attention given to the subject of CSR and an increasing amount of 
literature on the subject and on a new work ethic. According to The Chartered Management 
Institute, CSR is now an important and increasingly specialised aspect of strategy and man-
agement. Over recent decades, it has become a necessity rather than a choice, due to: 
 ●  legal changes that have made some aspects of CSR compulsory; 
 ●  increased public interest in environmental and ethical issues; 
 ●  a convincing business case linking CSR to better performance; 
 ●  shareholder pressure on businesses to show they operate ethically. 
 CSR is concerned with building integrity and fairness into corporate policies, strategies and 
decision-making. CSR policies can benefi t an organisation by developing and enhancing 
relationships with customers and suppliers, help to attract and retain a strong workforce, 
and improve a business’s reputation and standing. To be eff ective, it must be: embedded 
into everyone’s thinking and behaviour, particularly that of leaders; integrated into organi-
sational culture, policies and procedures; and built into organisational operations and 
activities at all levels. 21  
 Pearce suggests that many companies were involved in CSR simply because it was the right 
thing to do, but the story now is very diff erent. 
 The pure motives behind and areas of action in regard to corporate social responsibility have 
been blurred. There are now so many strands, aspects, viewpoints and stakeholders involved 
in CSR that it can be diffi  cult for companies to get a grip on precisely what it is they are, or 
should, be doing. This is not something that can be shrugged off , or put on the back burner – 
those companies that fail to adequately address CSR issues could be putting themselves in the 
line of fi re. 22

 Management and organisational behaviour in action case study 
 Corporate social responsibility:   Graham McWilliam, BSkyB 
 CSR is good for brands 
 it always strikes me as surprising, when talking to my peers at other companies, how many of them talk about the 
substantial time they have to spend lobbying their colleagues to take cSr seriously. 
 Maybe one of the problems is the phrase itself – corporate social responsibility – which implies a commitment 
without a return; something you have to do, but from which you can derive little value. and why, in tough economic 
times, would companies prioritise something that doesn’t help the bottom line? Why indeed. 
 at Sky, we look at things a little diff erently. We don’t talk about cSr. instead, we concentrate on long-term value 
creation, grounded in a focus on what really counts for customers. looking at things from this angle, it makes perfect 
commercial sense to act responsibly day to day and to contribute broadly to the communities around you. 
 after all, like it or not, your brand isn’t only created by what you say about yourself. it’s built on what others say 
and think about you, which itself is built on their experience of what you do. For good or bad, that infl uences cus-
tomer loyalty, employee engagement, investor sentiment and the regulatory and political climate. 
 this point is increasingly important in business. all those stakeholder groups now have fast and easy access to a 
wealth of information and commentary about your company, from news reports to social media conversations. Seg-
menting your audiences and controlling the message is becoming an impossible task. and, anyway, all the research 
shows people are more likely to trust what they hear through their informal networks than what they hear directly 
from you. 
 Don’t just say it, do it 
 So, focus fi rst on doing, rather than saying, the right things. Set it all in the context of long-term value creation, 
and you’ll fi nd it’s no longer an unwanted responsibility to be discharged, but a positive opportunity to build trust, 
encourage reappraisal and open up new commercial avenues. 
 at Sky, we’re proud of the positive contribution that our business makes to the communities around us, from 
bringing choice in tV to consumers, to the jobs that have been created for the 16,500 people who work at Sky. 
 but we want to do more, because we know it’s what our customers and employees expect of us, and because we 
know that it drives positive reappraisal of our brand by those who haven’t yet joined Sky. 
 So we’ve chosen three areas which we know our customers care about and where we think we can make the big-
gest diff erence: using our relationships with 10 million families across the UK and ireland to inspire action on climate 
change, encourage participation in sport and open up the arts to more people. 
 How CSR creates opportunity 
 our work in sport, for example, builds on our strong history and credibility in sports broadcasting to get more 
people active. Within this, our partnership with british cycling takes a three-pronged approach: support for the gb 
cycling team, enabling our elite cyclists to be the very best they can be; the creation of team Sky, the UK’s only pro-
fessional road racing team, to inspire a whole new generation of cyclists to get on their bikes; and Sky ride, a series 
of mass summer cycling events across the UK, free to all and free of traffi  c, which more than 200,000 people took 
part in last year. 
 the long-term commercial benefi ts of such activity are clear to us at Sky, but are equally easy to see at a large 
and growing number of other successful UK companies. For such brands, cSr isn’t about responsibility. it’s about 
opportunity, creating sustainable value over the long term. and, if you want to be around for years to come, that’s 
hard to argue with.

Organisational stakeholders
Social responsibilities are often viewed in terms of organisational stakeholders – that is, those 
individuals or groups who have an interest in and/or are affected by the goals, operations or 
activities of the organisation or the behaviour of its members. Stakeholders include a wide 
variety of potential interests and may be considered under a number of headings. For exam-
ple, drawing on the work of Donaldson and Preston,23 Rollinson suggests a comprehensive 
view of stakeholders in terms of the potential harm and benefits approach.24 See Figure 14.2.

A blurred distinction
Arguably, there is still something of blurred distinction between the exercise of a genuine 
social responsibility, on the one hand, and actions taken in pursuit of good business prac-
tice and the search for organisational efficiency on the other. One approach is that attention 
to social responsibilities arises out of a moral or ethical motivation and the dictates of con-
science – that is, out of genuine philanthropic objectives. An alternative approach is that the 
motivation is through no more than enlightened self-interest and the belief that, in the long 
term, attention to social responsibilities is simply good business sense. In practice, it is a mat-
ter of degree and balance, of combining sound economic management with an appropriate 
concern for broader responsibilities to society.
The UN Global Compact
The United Nations Global Compact is a call to companies to align strategies and operations 
with universal principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and to 
take actions that advance societal goals. The UN Global Compact is a leadership platform for 

516
part 4 StrUctUre, Strategy and eFFectiVeneSS
the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible corporate policies and prac-
tices. Launched in 2000, it is the world’s largest voluntary corporate sustainability initiative, 
with over 12,000 signatories from business and key stakeholder groups based in 145 countries 
( www.unglobalcompact.org ). 
 The UN Global Compact’s ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environ-
ment and anti-corruption enjoy universal consensus and are derived from: 
 ●  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
 ●  The International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work 
 ●  The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 
 ●  The United Nations Convention Against Corruption 
 T he UN Global Compact asks companies to embrace, support and enact, within their sphere 
of infl uence, a set of core values in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environ-
ment and anti-corruption: 
 Human rights 
 ●  Pr inciple 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally pro-
claimed human rights; and 
 ●  Pr inciple 2:  make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 
 Labour 
 ●  Pr inciple 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the eff ective recogni-
tion of the right to collective bargaining; 
 ●  Pr inciple 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; 
 ●  Pr inciple 5: the eff ective abolition of child labour; and 
 ●  Pr inciple 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 
 Environment 
 ●  Pr inciple 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental 
challenges; 
 ●  Pr inciple 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and 
 ●  Pr inciple 9: encourage the development and diff usion of environmentally friendly 
technologies. 
 Anti-corruption 
 ●  Pr inciple 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion 
and bribery. 25 
 Critical review and refl ection

 In a similar vein, do YOU think that ideas of business ethics and corporate social responsibility can be argued to 
be mainly of relevance to larger corporations, because only they have the financial and other resources to behave in 
this way? 

Chapter 14  Strategy, corporate responsibility and ethics 
517
Values and ethics
The question of values and ethics in business has been thrown into sharp focus in the years 
following the financial crisis of 2007–8. Since the dramatic events of autumn 2008 that fol-
lowed the collapse of prominent US investment bank Lehman Brothers, many of the major 
economies in the world have faced an extended period of low or negative growth, with rising 
unemployment and very low levels of business and consumer confidence, all of which made 
an early resumption of growth less likely. Some economists have published books suggesting 
that we must learn to accept, or even embrace, a future with much lower economic growth.26
Many governments have had to attempt to rein in public spending, with growing levels of 
resentment and disillusionment in some countries. In a number of parts of Europe, this has 
been linked with increased support for new political parties with populist agendas, whose 
manifestos often reflect a sense of unease at the effects of globalisation, together with a view 
that governments should intervene more, rather than less, to protect the interests of ordinary 
people. Unsurprisingly, given the origins of the 2008 crisis, bankers – or at least highly paid 
senior managers in global banks – were the initial focus of public opprobrium, but dissatisfac-
tion with business and with capitalism has spread more broadly.
One consequence has been a growing focus in political discussions on inequality or, more 
specifically, on the way in which greatly increased rewards for the so-called ‘super rich’ have led 
to growing inequality in recent decades. An example of this was the remarkable sales success 
in 2014 of French economist Thomas Piketty’s 700-page volume Capital in the Twenty-First 
Century, which led to lively discussions in the media about the causes and implications of these 
developments.27A similar sense of scepticism about the turn-of-the-century enthusiasm for 
lightly regulated business was reflected in Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel’s 2012 book,28 
which warned of the risks of allowing markets – with their logic of buying and selling – to 
spread into areas beyond the commercial supply of goods and services.
A further trend in recent years has been the increasingly insistent demands that businesses – 
and particularly multinational businesses with global operations – should pay ‘fair’ levels of tax 
to the countries in which they sell products and services, rather than actively seeking to minimise 
the amounts due.
Moral compass
Opinions as to exactly what went wrong in 2008 varied widely – and still do. For many, the 
problem was one of inadequate regulation – rules that are insufficiently detailed and/or inef-
fectively applied. However, commentators across the political spectrum have sometimes also 
alluded to a lack of moral awareness in business and public affairs – the absence of an intuitive 
sense of right and wrong (sometimes referred to as a moral compass). These two aspects of 
ethical business will be discussed in greater detail later, but it should already be clear that these 
questions can be complex. In this section, we outline the influence of ethical considerations in 
terms of the actions taken by the organisation in pursuit of its strategic objectives, together 
with the ethical implications of interpersonal interaction, both inside the organisation and 
between individuals across organisational boundaries.
Ethics and business
Ethics is concerned with the study of morality: practices and activities that are considered to 
be importantly right or wrong, together with the rules that govern those activities and the val-
ues to which those activities relate.29 It seeks to understand what makes good things good, for 
example, in ways that can be generalised to other similar cases. Business ethics can be seen as 
an example of applied ethics – just as medical ethics is about the application of general ethics 

518
part 4 StrUctUre, Strategy and eFFectiVeneSS
to the human activity called medicine, business ethics seeks to explore the implications of gen-
eral ethics for the conduct of business. This apparently obvious point is important: by taking 
this stance, one rejects the view that moral principles have no bearing on business, or that ‘the 
business of business is business’, as the common saying has it. 
 This is not to say that it is easy, or uncontroversial, to apply ethics to business; on the 
contrary, this fast-growing subject is characterised by a range of sharply contrasting views. 
Some of this controversy is inherent in ethics itself – as will be discussed below, there is no 
single clear view of how to judge good and bad, and this must impact on any application 
such as business ethics. This particular application of ethics, however, is also complicated 
by the fact that ethics mainly deals with good or bad conduct on the part of individuals, 
resulting in possible diffi  culties in applying these ideas to impersonal corporate entities 
like companies. Is it appropriate to regard companies as if they were individual people 
and, if not, what allowances should be made? Or, can the subject be satisfactorily seen as 
relating to the conduct of individuals as employees of businesses? Clearly, for very small 
businesses, the two views merge into one, but for larger, corporate entities, the position is 
more complex. 
 A discussion of ethics in business organisations has to take account of the purpose of 
the organisation, as well as its strategy: what it is trying to achieve, usually in competition 
with other similar businesses. These two factors are important because of their infl uence 
on what the organisation chooses to do and thus on the consequences for people inside and 
outside the organisation. A decision by an airline, for example, to pursue a low-cost strategy 
will have signifi cant impacts on what is required of its staff  and how well that business fares 
in the market. A successful implementation of such a strategy may mean fast growth, with 
attractive career development opportunities for some staff , but also more negative conse-
quences for others. On the other hand, the failure of a strategy can lead to the end of the 
organisation as an independent entity, with more widespread adverse consequences for the 
organisation’s people.  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 of course guidelines on values and business ethics are important, but in times of economic recession organisation 
survival and obligations to the workforce should take precedence. it is understandable if a blind eye is turned to 
bribery and corruption. 
 To what extent do YOU believe such a view can ever be justified? 
 Ethics and CSR 
 One illustration of the complexity of issues in business ethics is the diversity of opinion on 
the issue of CSR (discussed above). On one side of the debate are those who would share 
 Milton Friedman ’s view that the social responsibility of business is to make as much money 
as possible for the shareholders, within the law and the rules of the game (fair competition, 
no deception or fraud and so on). 30 This  shareholder-centred view sees the directors of a 
company as agents of the owners, who are duty bound to act so as to maximise the interests 
of those owners, this being taken as the reason for owners having made the investment in the 
fi rst place. 
 A more recent development of this general approach is that of  Sternberg who proposes 
a teleological view of business ethics, based upon the pursuit of the business purpose – that 
of maximising long-term owner wealth by selling products and services. 31 Actions by a fi rm 
that are consistent with this aim and that satisfy the additional tests of common decency (e.g. 

Chapter 14  Strategy, corporate responsibility and ethics 
519
refraining from stealing, cheating, coercion and so on) and distributive justice (i.e. ensuring 
that rewards are proportional to contributions made) are ethical. Actions that fail any one of 
these three tests are, in this model, unethical.
At the other end of the spectrum are some forms of stakeholder theory, which emphasise a 
much broader set of social responsibilities for business. Cannon suggests that:
There exists an implicit or explicit contract between business and the community in which it 
operates. Business is expected to create wealth; supply markets; generate employment; inno-
vate and produce a sufficient surplus to sustain its activities and improve its competitiveness 
while contributing to the maintenance of the community in which it operates. Society is 
expected to provide an environment in which business can develop and prosper, allowing 
investors to earn returns while ensuring that the stakeholders and their dependants can enjoy 
the benefits of their involvement without fear of arbitrary or unjust action. The interdepend-
ence between society and business cannot be overstated.32
Differing assumptions about a business
The two perspectives provide very different views of how a business should act, because of 
their differing assumptions concerning what a business is for. In the shareholder-centred view, 
a business is principally for the shareholders and its actions should mainly be judged on the 
criterion of maximising their interests. In the stakeholder view quoted above, a business is for 
its stakeholders (who are potentially a very large and diverse group) and its actions should be 
designed to balance stakeholder interests. From the point of view of business ethics – the study 
of good and bad conduct in business – this distinction is very important. The use of company 
resources to support a local community project, for example, might be seen as admirable in 
the stakeholder view but unethical in the shareholder-centred view, in that it would be a misap-
plication of funds that belong to the owners (unless, of course, such an investment could be 
shown to be consistent with the shareholders’ best interests).
‘Goodness’ of proposed action
Each of the two approaches adopts a different yardstick for judging the ‘goodness’ of a pro-
posed action by a company. In the shareholder-centred view, the action has to be shown to be 
consistent with the duty of maximising owner wealth, which is conceptually relatively simple, 
but which necessarily involves assumptions concerning the likely effect of the proposed action 
(or, more precisely, the difference between taking the proposed action and not taking it). In 
the stakeholder view (or, at least in those versions of the stakeholder view that emphasise an 
accountability to stakeholders), the task of management is to balance stakeholder interests. 
However, managers seeking to do this – often in the face of loud opposing claims from the 
various interests – will very quickly encounter the practical problem of how that ‘balance’ 
should be defined and recognised.
Although difficult to reconcile in practice, the two approaches are not completely incom-
patible: to a stakeholder theorist, shareholders count as one type of stakeholder, but not the 
only type to which duties are owed by the firm. Likewise, Sternberg acknowledges the impor-
tance of understanding and remaining aware of the various stakeholder groups and of actively 
managing relationships between the company and these groups, because doing so is likely to 
be consistent with maximising owner wealth. As she points out, however, ‘taking account’ of 
something is importantly different from ‘being accountable’ to it.33
Intelligent self-interest
It is also worth emphasising that a company seeking to maximise its owners’ long-term 
wealth may well do very good things for its ‘stakeholders’, not necessarily through any direct 
intent but in pursuit of its main duty. Providing customers with excellent products and ser-
vices is the central example, of course, but this form of intelligent self-interest may also – for 

520
part 4 StrUctUre, Strategy and eFFectiVeneSS
example – drive a fi rm to build strong, trusting relationships with its suppliers and distribu-
tors (because it will be better off  as a result), or an attractive working environment for its 
employees (because it wishes to recruit and keep the best, in order to be able to compete more 
eff ectively). 
 Even beyond its immediate commercial relationships, an intelligently self-interested com-
pany may deliberately set out to build strong relationships with other stakeholders, or to take 
a principled stance on an issue such as the use of child labour, because to do so is to maximise 
owner value. The ‘value’ in question is not just next year’s dividends, but refers to the value of 
the investment as a whole and thus obliges the management to think long term as well as short 
term and to consider the impact of company actions as broadly as possible. 
 Off shoring example 
 By way of an illustration of the two approaches, we could imagine how a UK-based company 
might think about an opportunity to ‘off shore’ part of its operation to a lower-cost Anglo-
phone country. The shareholder-centred view would place emphasis on the unit cost savings to 
be achieved by moving the operation to a lower-cost area, provided that the required quality of 
service can be maintained. Other things being equal, lower unit costs obviously allow higher 
margins and improved rewards to shareholders. However, the assessment would also take into 
account the possibility of additional risks to be managed, such as security and quality control 
issues. Furthermore, this view would also consider the competitive implications of the deci-
sion: if other suppliers all outsource and reduce their prices to customers, a decision  not to 
do the same could damage the company. On the other hand, being diff erent could be a viable 
competitive stance for one or more competitors, particularly if some customers are concerned 
about reduced quality of service from off shoring; at one point, NatWest in the UK seemed to 
take this stance in its advertising. 
 A stakeholder-centred company would place more emphasis on the impacts of the 
decision on the various stakeholder groups, notably including UK employees in this case. 
Although the decision to off shore might still be seen as competitively necessary by such a 
company, it might feel impelled to make more generous arrangements for those whose jobs 
are to be replaced, both out of a sense of long-term obligation and to preserve its image 
in the UK labour market. The question as to whether the group defi ned as ‘those that the 
company has not yet recruited in the off shore location’ should also be considered to be a 
stakeholder group – with a legitimate claim for attention – is one of the numerous judge-
ments to be made in this approach. 
 In the UK, the report of the RSA Inquiry ‘Tomorrow’s Company’ referred to the concept of 
an imaginary ‘operating licence’ granted to a company by the public, which can be eff ectively 
suspended or withdrawn if a company appears to be behaving badly. 34 Doing business eff ec-
tively and well relies upon hundreds, sometimes thousands, of transactions every day of the 
year. If some of these transactions become more diffi  cult because trust has been squandered 
and co-operation has been withdrawn, then the fi rm will start to lose out to its better-behaved 
competitors and its owners’ wealth will start to suff er. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the stakeholder view of a business may appear ethically attractive but is too idealistic. the shareholder-centred 
view consistent with maximising owner wealth makes more sense. Without this wealth people would be reluctant 
to invest in a business and it would not be possible to satisfy fully the demands of the diverse group of stakeholders. 
 What do YOU see as the criticisms of this point of view? How would YOU prepare a counterargument? 

Chapter 14  Strategy, corporate responsibility and ethics 
521
Ethics and corporate purpose
How do these issues relate to the question of ethics and the corporate purpose? To return to 
the problems of the global financial services industry, events since 2008 have provided a stark 
example of a collapse in public trust of many formerly respected institutions.
There is much lively discussion of what went so badly wrong and what should be done in 
the future, but there is a general agreement that global banks under ‘light-touch’ regulation 
did not manage to act in ways that were consistent with their shareholders’ interest (to put it 
mildly). In the years leading up to the autumn 2008 crisis, many banks grew rapidly and took 
risks that with hindsight were not well managed. When these risks turned bad – triggered by 
the problems in the US housing market – the damage turned out to be uncontainable for some 
and also exposed the extra risk represented by the interconnectedness of modern global finan-
cial services institutions. One notable quote came from Alan Greenspan, the former Chairman 
of the US Federal Reserve:
I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interest of organisations, specifically banks and 
others, were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their 
equity in the firms . . . Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions 
to protect shareholders’ equity (myself especially) are in a state of shocked disbelief.
These comments were made by Greenspan to a Congressional Committee in October 
2008.35 They are notable because Greenspan had been a lifelong believer in free markets 
and the leading advocate of light-touch regulation, and had been widely admired as such 
during the good years. His frank admission of a mistaken assumption about the behaviour 
of senior executives is particularly telling because it appears to cast doubt on one of the 
main foundations of Friedman’s view of the corporate purpose – that society is best served 
by encouraging businesses to compete with each other within the law, with minimal further 
regulation.
The hugely expensive bailouts and nationalisations that resulted from the crisis have been 
followed by further revelations of questionable practice by banks: in the UK, for example, 
major banks were obliged by the courts to set aside billions of pounds to cover the expected 
cost of compensation for the mis-selling of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) to large num-
bers of customers over a period of years.36 This counted as ‘mis-selling’ because the prod-
ucts were unsuitable (i.e. of little or no value) to a number of groups – the self-employed, 
for example, or those with pre-existing health conditions. Most of the major banks were 
involved in this market, with strong pressure on staff to sell these profitable products wher-
ever possible.
With hindsight, we can see that it should have been possible for senior managers to work 
out that this type of selling could eventually lead to claims against the bank that would 
outweigh any profits from the sales. Had this been done, some of the problems might have 
been averted. But there is perhaps something further to be said here: it hardly requires a 
degree in moral philosophy to work out that selling products to customers who quite fore-
seeably cannot benefit from them is an abuse of trust and something that a bank – or any 
other business – simply should not do. This is a clear example of the importance of the 
‘moral compass’ mentioned earlier.
Reliance on regulators
The PPI example also leads to a further question about relying on regulations to govern the 
behaviour of companies: whether it is realistic to aim at regulations that completely rule out 
any bad or undesirable practice. This is difficult enough in its own right, but the risk is that 
increasingly detailed regulations will be taken by some as a list of things that may not be done, 
with the corollary that anything not expressly forbidden is potentially worth considering. This 

522
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
sort of cat-and-mouse game between regulators and regulated is an unhealthy use of energy 
and talent, partly because regulators will necessarily need time to absorb and respond to mar-
ket innovations, but also because the quiet and insistent voice of the moral compass (‘we just 
shouldn’t do this’) may be drowned out entirely.
The PPI mis-selling scandal is not the only cause for concern – other reported problems 
have involved the mis-selling of interest rate hedging products, as well as the substantial fines 
imposed by US and UK regulators for attempts to manipulate the LIBOR inter-bank settle-
ment rate. In 2014, some six years after the onset of the global financial crisis, UK and US 
regulators imposed fines totalling £2.6 billion on six prominent global banks in respect of 
attempts by traders to manipulate benchmark foreign exchange rates, whose levels are used 
every day to value a range of assets in world trade. Notably – and perhaps depressingly – this 
misbehaviour was reported by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority to have been going on 
between 2008 and 2013, that is to say after the injection of enormous sums of taxpayers’ 
money into ailing banks in both countries.37
The prevalence of problems of this sort – whose consequences should have been all too 
predictable – in the industry may cause some to wonder whether the problems in some 
major banks are actually cultural at root, rather than arising from localised and temporary 
misbehaviour.
Moral reflection in ethical decision-making
The importance of active moral reflection in ethical decision-making in business would prob-
ably have come as no surprise to Adam Smith, the founder of the discipline of economics. 
Smith’s 1776 work The Wealth of Nations was the first to set out clearly how markets work 
and how self-interested individuals competing in markets are guided by an ‘invisible hand’ to 
benefit society, even though this may be no part of their intention. Thus self-interest, mediated 
through the mechanism of the market, can be to the general advantage. But Smith’s origi-
nal discipline was not economics, but moral philosophy – his first major work, The Theory 
of Moral Sentiments, was published in 1759. The point here is that markets are best under-
stood as very efficient systems for organising the supply of products and services to meet the 
demands of buyers. Beyond this very useful function, markets can offer no moral guidance, 
nor any guarantee that market outcomes will be ethically desirable. This gap can only be 
closed by the application of moral sense by actors in the market. In the 1930s this seemed to 
be very clear to bankers, as is evident in the famous statement made by J. P. Morgan Jr to a US 
Senate Sub-Committee in 1933:38
I should state that at all times the idea of doing only first-class business, and that in a first-
class way, has been before our minds. We have never been satisfied with simply keeping 
within the law, but have constantly sought so to act that we might fully observe the profes-
sional code, and so maintain the credit and reputation which has been handed down to us 
from our predecessors in the firm.
Of course, banking and the regulation of banking have become far more complex since the 
1930s, but the basic sense of right and wrong is just as important today as it was then. The 2012 
BBC Reith lecturer Niall Ferguson used one of his lectures39 to express doubt about whether 
more complex and detailed regulation would provide an answer to the problems experienced 
in the financial services industry. It might be better, he suggested, to re-examine the approach 
described by Walter Bagehot’s 1873 work Lombard Street, with a very powerful central bank 
exercising control based upon discretion, rather than detailed rules, and with the clear sanc-
tion of imprisonment for serious transgressions.
One further comment can be made in passing – it is not entirely clear that a greater stake-
holder focus on the part of banks would have led to a very different outcome by 2008. Many 
of the banks badly damaged by the crisis were engaged in significant CSR programmes, as 
their websites at the start of 2009 made clear. With the benefit of hindsight, many stakeholders 

Chapter 14  Strategy, corporate responsibility and ethics 
523
might have opted for more thoughtful and principled management of banks, rather than the 
benefits of bank CSR programmes. Increasingly, the phrase ‘corporate social responsibility 
(CSR)’ is being replaced by ‘corporate responsibility (CR)’. If this signifies a more compre-
hensive assessment of a corporation’s effect on society, routinely making full use of a moral 
compass, then this seems to be a welcome step forward.
Business ethics
The large-scale issues of CSR are to do with how a company should conduct itself within 
society; these questions certainly have an ethical aspect, as has been discussed, but they are not 
the whole of business ethics. Day-to-day decisions made by individual managers are not usu-
ally made on the basis of some detailed calculation of the consequences for shareholder value 
(however theoretically desirable that might be) and more general ethical considerations must 
play a part in resolving the dilemmas that sometimes arise in practice.
No single view of right or wrong
These questions can be complex, since there is no single view in general ethics of what makes 
something right or wrong. One school of thought emphasises duties, things that must be done 
(or refrained from) irrespective of the consequences. This deontological point of view holds 
that goodness or badness is evident only in the action itself: that, for example, lying is bad 
because it is bad in itself. By contrast, a consequentialist view of ethics holds that the goodness 
or badness of a proposed action is evident only in the consequences of that action: whether a 
lie is good or bad depends upon the consequences of that particular lie at the time. Utilitarian-
ism, for example, is a consequentialist theory, in that it seeks to maximise the net happiness 
for everyone affected by a particular action (‘the greatest good for the greatest number’, as it 
is sometimes expressed). Both of the perspectives on CSR discussed in the previous section are 
also to some extent consequentialist, in that they are mainly concerned with an assessment of 
the effects of a firm’s actions. We can also note that the idea of a moral compass typical of a 
duties-based approach to ethics – the sense that we just shouldn’t do this – is one that is not 
reliant on any calculation of the consequences.
Both duties and consequences are plainly important in the way we deal with ethical issues 
in everyday life. Unfortunately, however, they are very different ways of reasoning, which can 
lead to contradictory outcomes in some cases. An exclusively duty-based view of ethics, for 
example, must sooner or later run into problems such as absolutism, or the difficulty of decid-
ing which duty should take precedence over others in a particular situation. If, for example, 
both lying and killing are held to be inherently wrong, is it acceptable to lie in order to avoid a 
killing? And whatever answer is given, how do we know?
Informing our views
Nonetheless, duties and principles clearly do inform our views of how people should treat 
each other at work. An exclusively consequentialist view of ethics is likely to entail methodo-
logical problems of forecasting reliably what the consequences of an action may be and of 
deciding how to measure those consequences. Some forms of utilitarianism can be very unjust 
to small minorities, by allowing their unhappiness (i.e. as a result of some proposed action) to 
be offset by the increased happiness of a much larger number. Again, however, we can hardly 
deny that our assessment of the likely consequences of different actions plays a part in our 
view of acceptable and unacceptable behaviour in an organisation.
To return briefly to the earlier example of offshoring, a deontological approach to the 
ethics of offshoring would focus on aspects of the proposal that might be in breach of clear 

524
part 4 StrUctUre, Strategy and eFFectiVeneSS
principles and duties. While no business can reasonably accept a general duty to keep exist-
ing employees on the payroll for ever, a contemplation of duties might cause a company to 
do as much as reasonably possible to soften the impact of the job losses, including the pos-
sibility of internal transfer, retraining, outplacement and more-than-minimum redundancy 
packages. 
 A utilitarian analysis would seek to identify all who would be aff ected – anywhere in the 
world – by the proposed off shoring decision and then assess the impact (positive or negative) 
on each person (or, more realistically, group). This would allow a sort of ‘trial balance’ of the 
consequences to be drawn up and an evaluation of the net impact on aggregate happiness. 
Necessarily in this method, the reduction in happiness for others, such as those who are made 
involuntarily redundant, is off set by the extra happiness created for some – those who get the 
off shore jobs, for example. Obviously, this is of little comfort to the former group, which illus-
trates one of the important criticisms of the utilitarian approach. 
 Ethical decision-making at work 
 How, then, are ethical choices to be made by people working for organisations? No simple and 
universal answer is available – ethical awareness is something that can be cultivated and the 
diff erent perspectives will often help to shed light on a particular dilemma. Some perspectives 
may appear to be better suited to particular situations: whereas, for example, it is diffi  cult 
to avoid some sort of consequentialist component in thinking about how a company should 
act, it is also clear that duty-based (or ‘moral compass’) arguments must also weigh heavily in 
thinking about the ethical treatment of people such as employees. The German philosopher 
Kant’s view that we should always treat other people as ends in themselves and never simply as 
means is surely an important principle for ethical and decent HRM and one that would often 
be seen as more important than the prospect of short-term gain. 40 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 provided companies comply fully with the laws of the land it is unfair to criticise them for behaving in a manner that 
benefits them most, even if this might be regarded as a breach of their social responsibilities. 
 To what extent do YOU feel able to justify this point of view as reasonable business practice? 
 Personal integrity and individual values are important elements in ethical decision-making 
at work, but the increasingly common company, professional or industry codes of conduct 
may also provide support and guidance (notice also the reference to the professional code 
in the 1933 quote from J. P. Morgan above). This is not to say that these ethical ‘resources’ 
will always provide clear and comfortable guidance – sometimes, people in organisations will 
experience tension between the confl icting demands of, say, their own personal values and the 
demands placed on them by their organisation. If these confl icts become intolerable and can-
not be resolved through normal means, then an individual may decide to become a ‘whistle-
blower’ in the public interest, by taking the high-risk approach of placing the problem in the 
public domain for resolution. Codes of conduct can help to reduce the risk of painful situa-
tions like this by providing a published set of values to which the individual can appeal, rather 
than taking the risk wholly personally.

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Codes of business conduct (or ethics)
The previous section has suggested that detailed regulations, laws or codes may not by them-
selves guarantee ethical conduct if they are not accompanied by a clear moral sense on the part 
of the businesses making decisions about how to behave. Codes of conduct may, however, play 
a very important role in fostering ethical conduct in organisations, by sending clear guidance 
to employees about what is expected of them and to the outside world about the standards by 
which the organisation wishes to be judged. In some cases, concise and clear codes of conduct 
may also arise from a distillation of the knowledge and experience of the organisation over 
many years, which may be particularly helpful to junior or less experienced staff in their day-
to-day work.
In US and Canadian organisations, codes of conduct are very common and in many cases 
members of the organisation are required to sign to indicate formally their acceptance. Codes 
may be updated on a regular basis.
IBM publishes a comprehensive document of business conduct guidelines relating to the 
ethical practices and values of the company.
IBM’s Business Conduct Guidelines are, at the most basic level, a description of the conduct 
we establish for all IBMers to comply with laws and ethical practices wherever we do busi-
ness. It is a living document that we regularly review and update, as business and the world 
at large become more complex. But the BCGs have always been about more than compli-
ance and ethics. By establishing these guidelines decades ago and giving them weight of a 
governing document, we have embraced the proposition that our choices and actions define 
IBM for others. And we have sought to ensure that our relationships – with clients, investors, 
colleagues and the communities in which we live and work – are built on our core value of 
trust and personal responsibility.41
The document includes a comprehensive set of guidelines on: Speaking Up; In the Work-
place; In the Marketplace; On Your Own Time; Further Guidance.
In the UK an increasing number of organisations, of all types, also now publish a code of conduct or code of ethics. 
For example:
The Chartered Management Institute (CMI) has a Code of Conduct and Practice that is binding on all ­members. 
The code encapsulates, with supporting examples, six key principles:
● Behaving in an open, honest and trustworthy manner.
● Acting in the best interest of your organisation, customers, clients and/or partners.
● Continually developing and maintaining professional knowledge and competence.
● Respecting the people with whom you work.
● Creating a positive impact on society.
● Upholding the reputation of the profession and the institute.42
The University of Portsmouth has a detailed ‘Ethics Policy’ (as approved by Academic Council, 12 November 2013) 
and under ‘Values’ includes:
The University’s Strategy 2012-2017 includes a statement of values which should be reflected in all the policies and 
practices of the University. The Strategy states: 'We will be a socially responsible university, serious about inclusivity 
and committed to improving social mobility. We will maintain the highest levels of academic and professional integ-
rity and will ensure that we deliver our obligations in relation to corporate social responsibility. Our strategy will be 
driven by values of equality, openness, tolerance and respect. We will demonstrate and expect of others ethical and 
responsible behaviours.43
Codes of conduct or ethics

Chapter 14  Strategy, corporate responsibility and ethics 
527
An integrated approach
The late Anita Roddick suggested that business leaders should make ethics part of their 
heritage.
We need to develop a corporate code of conduct, a formal, articulated and well-defined set 
of principles which all global businesses agree to live up to. A broadly kept code of conduct 
would shut down the excuse about the competition making ethical behaviour impossible 
once and for all. We must all agree not to compete in ways that destroy communities or the 
environment. We must all embrace the principles of socially responsible business, because 
the decisions of business leaders not only affect economies, but societies. Unless businesses 
understand that they have responsibilities they must live up to, in terms of world poverty, the 
environment and human rights, the future for us all is pretty bleak.44
According to Philippa Foster Back, OBE (Director, Institute of Business Ethics), the glo-
balisation of business has raised questions of applying ethical values to the different cultures 
and societies in which organisations operate. The challenge for everyone concerned with 
ethics now is to ensure that values are embedded throughout an organisation. A code of 
ethics needs to be translated into reality through training and enforcement and driven from 
the top.45
McEwan summarises the separate histories of CSR, business ethics and corporate govern-
ance, and suggests a method of enquiry that attempts to integrate these different perspectives 
on business through three broad levels of enquiry:
● a descriptive approach that draws attention to the values and beliefs of people from dif-
ferent cultures and societies that influence their attitudes towards the various activities of 
business in their home countries and abroad;
● a normative approach that identifies sets of values and beliefs as a basis for making ethical 
decisions at the individual, group or senior management level in an organisation;
● an analytical approach that attempts to explore the relationship between these normative 
values and beliefs and other value-systems or ideologies, such as political or religious beliefs 
and culture or other social customs.46
A culture of ethics, integrity and compliance
Bennett points out that a culture of integrity focused on outstanding quality and business 
outcomes must be intentionally shaped and build on the values and principles of the organi-
sation. This involves seven steps of: (1) designate a compliance owner; (2) implement written 
standards and procedures; (3) conduct appropriate training; (4) develop open lines of commu-
nication; (5) centrally manage all reports and allegations; (6) respond consistently and appro-
priately to alleged offences; (7) audit, monitor and adapt as needed. Bennett also points out 
the need for an integrated effort.
Achieving an effective ethics and compliance programme requires more than simply adding 
rules and additional layers of controls. There must be an integrated effort that aligns financial 
and compliance requirements with the organisation’s mission and values.47
Related legislation
As part of the growing attention to the concept of CSR there are a number of pieces of recent 
legislation that arguably relate to the concept of business ethics and organisational account-
ability. Although it is not in the scope of this book to provide detailed aspects of legal provi-
sions, we should recognise the existence of such legislation, including the Human Rights Act 
1998, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, the Local Government Act 2000, the Freedom of 
Information Act 2000, the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007, the 
Bribery Act 2010 and the Equality Act 2010.

528
part 4 StrUctUre, Strategy and eFFectiVeneSS
 The  Human Rights Act 1998 came into force on 2 October 2000 and incorporates into 
English law rights and liberties enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. The 
provisions apply to the acts of ‘public authorities’ and make it unlawful for them to act in a 
way incompatible with a right under the Convention. The Act is designed to provide greater 
protection for individuals, and to protect them from unlawful and unnecessary interference. 
Everyone has the right to respect for their private and family life, their home and their corre-
spondence. The Act has a signifi cant eff ect on people both as citizens and at work. 
 The  Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, which has become known widely as the ‘Whistle-
blower’s Act’, is designed to protect people who expose wrongdoing at their workplace, to 
provide reassurance that there is a safe alternative to silence and to provide a safeguard against 
retaliation. Employers need to establish clear internal procedures by which members of staff  
can raise any matters of personal concern. 
 The  Local Government Act 2000, the so-called ‘New Ethical Framework’, requires all local 
authorities to provide codes of conduct to promote high standards of behaviour. The govern-
ment has distinguished between general principles of conduct in public service and the code 
of conduct containing specifi c actions and prohibitions that demonstrate the principles are 
being observed. 
 The  Freedom of Information Act 2000 gives the public one simple right to access informa-
tion held by public authorities. Under the Act, the public have a ‘right to know’. 
 The  Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007, which came into force on 
6 April 2008, clarifi es the criminal liabilities of companies including large organisations where 
serious failures in the management of health and safety result in a fatality. For the fi rst time, 
companies and organisations can be found guilty of corporate manslaughter as a result of 
serious management failures resulting in a gross breach of a duty of care. 
 The  Bribery Act 2010 consolidates and modernises the law on bribery and provides a more 
eff ective framework to combat bribery in both the private and public sectors. The Act creates 
a number of new off ences relating to promising or giving an advantage or to bribes, and intro-
duces anti-corruption regulations. 
 The  Equality Act 2010 covers areas of discrimination and bans unfair treatment and helps 
achieve equal opportunities in the workplace and in wider society. 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the harsh truth is that without eU intervention, government legislation and the threat of adverse press or television 
reports, the majority of organisations would give little regard to their social responsibilities or to business ethics. 
 To what extent do YOU support this contention? What has been YOUR experience of genuine concerns by organisa-
tions in general for their social responsibilities and ethical behaviour? 
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  Underlying the study of management and organisational behaviour is the nature of corporate 
strategy (or strategic management) for the organisation as a whole. 
  2  Strategy highlights the overall direction of an organisation, its goal, objectives and policy. the 
profi t objective is not, by itself, a suffi  cient criterion for eff ective management. 

Chapter 14 Strategy, corporate reSponSibility and ethicS 
529
  1  explain fully the nature, purpose and importance of corporate strategy. 
  2  identify examples of objectives and policy in your own university or organisation. to what extent do you agree 
with dryburgh’s assertion that SMart objectives are really dumb? 
  3  to what extent do you believe profit maximisation is a realistic criterion for the effective management of 
a business organisation? What other indicators might be applied in terms of organisational performance 
and results?  
  4  discuss critically the practical worth of value or mission statements and the extent to which they are likely to 
inspire members of staff . Support your answer with actual examples. 
  5  explain fully the concept and ramifi cations of corporate social responsibility (cSr). 
  6  how would you attempt to explain the meaning and signifi cance of organisational values and business ethics? 
  7  compare and contrast the shareholder-centred and stakeholder approaches to social responsibilities for busi-
ness. Which perspective do you tend to favour? 
  8  comment critically on the code of ethics (or code of professional conduct) for your university or organisation; 
or if one does not exist, draw up your own suggested code. 
  9  debate the extent to which you believe government legislation brings about a genuine advancement in the 
social responsibilities of organisations. 
  10  give your own views on the importance of, and amount of attention you believe should be given to, corporate 
social responsibilities and ethical behaviour. 
 Review and discussion questions 
  3   the goals and objectives of the organisation may be pursued in accordance with an underlying 
ideology that determines the culture and conduct of the organisation. 
  4   Strategy gives rise to the consideration of organisational values and beliefs that draw attention 
to the importance of integrity and trust and ethical leadership. 
  5   the organisation cannot operate in isolation from interactions with its external environment 
and this gives rise to broader corporate social responsibilities. 
  6   increasing attention is given to values and ethics and business. ethics is concerned with the 
study of morality and understanding what makes things good or bad. 
  7  two diff ering perspectives on ethics and corporate social responsibility, and how a business 
should act, are a shareholder-centred view and a stakeholder-theory view. 
  8   the scope of business ethics is very broad and gives rise to a number of questions including 
ethics and corporate purpose, and ethical decision-making at work. 
  9  an increasing number of organisations of all types publish a code of business (or professional) 
conduct, or ethics, which sets out their practices and values. 
  10  the globalisation of business highlights calls for an integrated approach to the application of 
ethical values. related legislation arguably gives support to the importance of organisational 
accountability.

 Over the last couple of decades, the ideals of fair trade 
have become prominent in UK retailing. The story of 
how this has come about shows how an organisation 
can make progress towards its own objectives through 
developing eﬀ ective networks with other organisations, 
about the trade-oﬀ s that have to be managed along the 
way and about the realities of achieving improvements 
in business ethics. 
 The general concerns about unfairness in world trade 
are easy enough to set out. Firstly, the gap between the 
living standards of the richest and the poorest is dis-
tressingly wide and the scale of poverty enormous. The 
UN Development Programme pointed out in 2015 that 
although poverty rates halved between 1990 and 2010, 
there are still more than 1.2 billion people around the 
world – about one in ﬁ ve in developing regions – who 
live in extreme poverty. 48 Secondly, the fact that this gap 
is so wide is often felt to be something to do with the 
way in which international trade operates (although the 
deﬁ nition of the actual problem is something on which 
experts diﬀ er sharply). Finally, there seems to be a grow-
ing sense that these are not just abstruse high-level pol-
icy problems, to be addressed by governments, experts 
and suchlike, but rather processes in which we  all take

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
part as a result of the choices we make when we buy 
and consume products and services. On the negative 
side, our demand for value for money in the shops may 
have unseen negative consequences for people in other 
countries who are in a much more parlous position than 
we are. More positively, consumer power may provide 
us with the means – if we take the trouble – to reduce 
the harm we do further along the supply chain and per-
haps even create change for the better. The Fairtrade 
movement has sought to address these problems.
The Fairtrade movement is an international network 
of partners, who define fair trade as follows:
Fairtrade is about better prices, decent working 
conditions, local sustainability, and fair terms of trade 
for farmers and workers in the developing world. By 
requiring companies to pay sustainable prices (which 
must never fall lower than the market price), Fairtrade 
addresses the injustices of conventional trade, which 
traditionally discriminates against the poorest, weakest 
producers. It enables them to improve their position 
and have more control over their lives.49
In the UK, the movement is centred around the Fairtrade 
Foundation, which was formed in 1992 by five promi-
nent charities, later joined by the Women’s Institute. 
Today, the Foundation has four main streams of activity:
● Providing independent certification of the trade 
chain and licensing use of the FAIRTRADE mark on 
products as a consumer guarantee.
● Help in growing demand for Fairtrade products  
and empowering producers to sell to traders and 
retailers.
● Working with partners to support producer organi-
sations and their networks.
● Raising public awareness of the need for fair trade 
and the significant role of the FAIRTRADE mark in 
making trade fair.50
Launching the concept
As regular press reports make clear, Fairtrade in the UK 
has grown rapidly since its launch in 1992, from the first 
certified product (Green and Blacks’ Maya Gold choco-
late), through growth to include a wider range of prod-
ucts and then entry into the catering trade. Twenty years 
after launch, more than 4,500 Fairtrade products were 
on sale in the UK, with 2013 sales valued at £1.78 bil-
lon, up 14 per cent from the previous year.51 For some 
years, percentage recognition of the Fairtrade mark has 
remained in the mid to high 70s,52 a key factor in driving 
the growth of adoption by retailers. There is, however, 
plenty of scope for further growth: although the UK is 
an international leader in Fairtrade product penetration, 
these products still accounted for just 1.5 per cent of the 
overall UK food and drink market in 2013.53
The evolution of the Fairtrade approach has been 
the subject of a number of studies. Davies54 suggests that 
three ‘eras’ can so far be distinguished:
● The ‘solidarity’ era (1970–90), in which sales were 
mainly in craft products, making use of alternative 
trading organisations such as not-for-profit and 
charity shops, specialist mail order and religious 
organisations. Product quality was inconsistent and 
sometimes poor, and branding very limited.
● The ‘niche market’ era (1990–2002), which saw a 
broadening of the range, with the growth of recog-
nisable Fairtrade labelling and an appeal directed 
mainly at the ethical consumer, based upon public 
relations and press campaigns.
● The ‘mass market’ era (from 2002 onwards), distin-
guished by a rapid expansion of (mostly) food prod-
ucts into a wider range of mainstream outlets – most 
notably supermarkets, but also major chains of cafés 
and restaurants. Critically, Fairtrade decided to include 
large organisations in the scheme, allowing them to 
broaden the appeal to the mass-market customer.
In an earlier paper, Jones et al.55 discussed some of the 
problems that had to be overcome when expanding 
into mass-market retail. For example, supermarkets 
need to secure adequate, consistent and regular sup-
plies to maintain stocks, without which the growing 
As the popularity of Fairtrade increases, is its growth 
­sustainable or has commercialism resulted in a 
­‘cleanwashing’ of an idealistic movement?

consumer awareness will come to nothing. This is 
sometimes a challenge for smaller producers in the UK, 
but when the producer of the Fairtrade product lives 
in a remote part of a country with underdeveloped 
infrastructure, then the problem can be far greater. In 
the early stages, the willingness of a wider section of 
the market to pay a small price premium for a Fairtrade 
product was an area of uncertainty. Supermarkets had 
to play their part in consumer education in the early 
days via in-store leaflets and display materials and 
advertising campaigns.
Davies also addresses the question of how this devel-
opment might continue in future, suggesting the pos-
sibility of more or less complete ‘institutionalisation’, in 
which the qualities of Fairtrade products become the 
norm for mainstream sales, rather than a specialised 
niche. Of course, this possibility only exists because 
Fairtrade products are now prominent in mass-market 
outlets. In future we may approach a tipping point 
where the average consumer will start to wonder why 
a particular brand on the supermarket shelf has no 
Fairtrade label. This could present a major management 
challenge for the Fairtrade Foundation: the label only 
works because it is widely recognised, understood and –  
above all – accepted as a trustworthy guarantee. That 
basic credibility is just as important for the supermarket 
retailer as for the consumer: if the reality starts to fall 
short of the promise in any respect, then things could 
quickly get difficult for the brand.
The issue of trust and credibility is becoming 
more complex for Fairtrade as its business grows: the 
FAIRTRADE logo has been joined in consumer con-
sciousness by a number of other certification schemes. 
This increased emphasis on the ethics of products is in 
many respects a welcome development. For Fairtrade, 
it means greater competition for the public’s attention, 
but it may also broaden the risk for the organisation and 
its image, since problems with any of these labelling 
schemes may damage credibility in ethical consump-
tion more generally. Also, the range of issues covered by 
these schemes is more extensive than fair trade alone, 
raising the prospect of confusion about what exactly an 
individual label does guarantee and hence the risk of 
disappointment as a result of mistaken expectations.
Good or not; who decides?
As the Fairtrade movement has grown it has attracted 
criticism from both political wings. Low and Daven-
port,56 for example, suggest that there are two dangers 
inherent in this growth: that of appropriation of the 
organisation by commercial interests in the process 
that the authors call ‘cleanwashing’; and the transfor-
mation of the Fairtrade message into one of ‘shopping 
for a better world’, in which the movement’s original 
radical values are watered down. A different critique 
arrived from the Right in 2008 when the free-market-
championing Adam Smith Institute published its report 
‘Unfair Trade’.57 Acknowledging the good intentions of 
the movement, it argued that the Fairtrade approach 
was far less effective in reducing poverty than global 
free trade would be, if rich countries were to abolish 
the trade barriers and domestic subsidies that make it 
hard for poor countries to sell to them. In 2010, the IEA 
also suggested that the Fairtrade approach could only 
benefit some producers; in particular, Fairtrade seemed 
not to focus its efforts on the poorest countries, but 
rather on middle-income countries, where Fairtrade 
penetration was higher.58
Those who work under a hot sun for low rates of pay 
could be forgiven a degree of impatience with these 
theoretical arguments: does it really matter if some of 
the greatly increased number of buyers of Fairtrade 
products do not fully grasp or agree with the radical 
agenda of the early days? Is it really better for poor 
people to wait for the arrival of the benefits of true free 
trade, given the glacial progress of international nego-
tiations towards that end? As Voltaire remarked, are we 
not in danger of letting the best be the enemy of the 
good? Those who benefit from the Fairtrade system  
seem to have little doubt of the improved benefits  
it brings.59
The Fairtrade movement has managed to achieve 
very rapid growth from a specialised niche into the 
mainstream. It has created and communicated a promi-
nent brand identity that provides consumers with a spe-
cific guarantee about the value chain that has brought 
the product to the shelf. To achieve and sustain this 
credibility, the Fairtrade Foundation has had to specify 
and manage what happens upstream, in order to use 
the immense power of the supermarkets to bring these 
products to the mainstream market. Many supermar-
kets have enthusiastically joined in the process of con-
sumer education about Fairtrade products, possibly for 
normal commercial reasons of self-interest. Yet they 
have undoubtedly helped the idea to become firmly 
established in the minds of their customers and thus to 
ensure that ethics stays on the consumer agenda, even 
in difficult economic times.

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
 Tasks
	 1	 Who are the stakeholders of the Fairtrade Foundation? Using Figure 14.2 as a starting point, identify 
examples of each type of stakeholder. Who are the most powerful? Who the most important? Identify areas 
where the interests of stakeholders conflict as well as those where they coincide.
	 2	 Explain what you think Low and Davenport mean by the term ‘cleanwashing’ and why this might be a 
danger to the values of the Fairtrade Foundation.
	 3	 With reference to the decision to include major supermarkets and other large-scale retailers in the scheme, 
discuss whether you think that ‘good’ acts can result from selfish motives or not. Present the arguments on 
both sides.
	 4	 How do you think the Fairtrade Foundation should present its message during an economic recession, 
when Western consumers might well be more motivated by price than other considerations?

 the socialisation of new members into an organisation’s culture and climate is no more than a management control 
system and manipulation of the individual. it is therefore unethical and should be condemned. 
 How would YOU challenge the validity of this statement? What has been YOUR personal experience of socialisation 
into YOUR university or organisation? 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 a central feature of the successful organisation is the diagnosis of its 
culture, health and performance, and the ability of the organisation 
to adapt to change. it involves the applications of organisational 
behaviour and recognition of the social processes of the organisation. 
the manager needs to understand the nature and importance of 
organisational culture and climate, and the successful implementation 
and management of organisational change.

Chapter 15  Organisational culture and change
537
Adapting to change
In order to thrive in an increasingly competitive, global environment with new technologies, 
an organisation must pay attention to its continual effectiveness and development. An underly-
ing feature of the successful organisation is the ability to adapt to change. This involves the 
applications of organisational behaviour and recognition of the social processes of the organi-
sation. No two organisations are the same. Each organisation has its own types of problems 
and most appropriate remedies. For an organisation to perform well and develop, the process 
of change must be in harmony with organisational culture. Successful management of change 
is dependent upon a culture of openness, participation and acceptance of new ideas. Sustained 
organisational improvement can only be achieved through involvement of people, who are the 
organisation.
‘Rapid technological changes create huge opportunities for companies bold enough to seize 
them.
(Attributed to Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO, Amazon)
Organisational culture
Although most of us will understand in our own minds what is meant by organisational cul-
ture, it is a general concept with many different meanings and difficult to define or explain 
precisely. There is also sometimes confusion over the difference between the interpretation 
of organisational culture and organisational climate (discussed below). Although people may 
not be aware consciously of culture, it still has a pervasive influence over their behaviour and 
actions. There is, however, no consensus on its meaning or its applications to the analysis of 
work organisations. A popular and simple way of defining culture is ‘how things are done 
around here’. For example, Atkinson explains organisational culture as reflecting the underly-
ing assumptions about the way work is performed; what is ‘acceptable and not acceptable’; 
and what behaviour and actions are encouraged and discouraged.1
A more detailed definition from Rachael Johnson, Editor of Governance & Compliance 
magazine, is:
In its broadest sense, our understanding of workplace culture is that it embodies the ethos 
and values of a particular organisation, which are expressed through the way it operates and 
the practices it undertakes. If the latter are deemed to be wrong, then the former needs to be 
addressed in order for any issues to be resolved effectively. Anything else would be superficial 
change and unlikely to have a lasting impact.2
The culture of an organisation is also often likened to the personality of an individual3 (see the 
Assignment at the end of this chapter).
Relationship between culture and change
The pervasive nature of organisational culture means that if change is to be brought about 
successfully, this is likely to involve changes to culture. For example, Stewart makes the follow-
ing comment on the relationship between culture and change:
In recent years attention has shifted from the effects of the organization of work on people’s 
behaviour to how behaviour is influenced by the organizational culture. What is much more 
common today is the widespread recognition that organizational change is not just, or even 
necessarily mainly, about changing the structure but often requires changing the culture too.4
A similar view is held by Naylor, who points out that: ‘In the holistic system, any change will 
affect the culture and the culture will affect or constrain the change . . . Cultural change is inti-
mately bound up with the process of organisational change.’5

538
part 4 structure, strategY and eFFectiVeness
 However, although attention is often given to shifting the prevailing activities and atmos-
phere of an organisation to a brighter future, changing the ethos and culture of an organisa-
tion is not easy. In practice, organisations usually appear to alter their underlying ethos only on 
a gradual basis and the complexity of environmental pressures may itself hinder rapid change. 
Culture is often deep-rooted, and commitment to the objectives and policies of the organisa-
tion, people’s cognitive limitations and their uncertainties and fears may mean a reluctance 
to accept a change in behaviour. Culture is reinforced through the system of rites and rituals, 
patterns of communication, the informal organisation, expected patterns of behaviour and 
perceptions of the psychological contract.  (Organisational change is discussed below.) 
 A depiction of the way elements of culture can support and/or defend against change is 
given in  Figure  15.1 . 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 it seems generally accepted that any organisational change will affect culture and that one of the main hurdles to 
effective adaption to change is the culture of the organisation. culture and change are linked. 
 To what extent do YOU support this contention? How would YOU explain the interrelationship between organisa-
tional culture and change?

 Levels of culture 
 Schein suggests a view of organisational culture based on distinguishing three levels of culture, 
from the shallowest to the deepest: artefacts and creations; values; and basic assumptions. 6 

Chapter 15  Organisational culture and change
539
● Level 1: Artefacts. The most visible level of the culture is artefacts and creations – the con-
structed physical and social environment. This includes physical space and layout, the tech-
nological output, written and spoken language and the overt behaviour of group members.
● Level 2: Espoused beliefs and values. Cultural learning reflects someone’s original values. 
Solutions about how to deal with a new task, issue or problem are based on convictions of 
reality. If the solution works, the value can transform into a belief. Values and beliefs become 
part of the conceptual process by which group members justify actions and behaviour.
● Level 3: Basic underlying assumptions. When a solution to a problem works repeatedly, it 
comes to be taken for granted. Basic assumptions are unconsciously held learned responses. 
They are implicit assumptions that actually guide behaviour and determine how group 
members perceive, think and feel about things.
Schein suggests that the basic assumptions are treated as the essence – what culture really is – 
and values and behaviours are treated as observed manifestations of the culture essence. See 
Figure 15.2.

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Naylor suggests that seeing quite what forms organisational culture is difficult, and to make a 
start we need to recognise both the visible and invisible layers. On the surface is the visible layer 
made up of elements such as artefacts, symbols, languages, stories and activities, which can be 
collected, compared and assembled into a description of the organisation. Underpinning this ‘vis-
ible culture’ is the invisible layer of beliefs, values, norms, basic assumptions and understanding.7
Types of organisational culture
There are a number of ways to classify different types of organisational culture. Two common 
classifications are those by Handy and by Deal and Kennedy. Developing the ideas of Harri-
son,8 Handy describes four main types of organisational cultures: power culture; role culture; 
task culture; and person culture.9
● Power culture depends on a central power source with rays of influence from the central 
figure throughout the organisation. A power culture is frequently found in small entrepre-
neurial organisations and relies on trust, empathy and personal communications for its 
effectiveness. Control is exercised from the centre by the selection of key individuals. There 
are few rules and procedures, and little bureaucracy. It is a political organisation with deci-
sions taken largely on the balance of influence.
● Role culture is often stereotyped as a bureaucracy and works by logic and rationality. Role 
culture rests on the strength of strong organisational ‘pillars’ – the functions of specialists 
in, for example, finance, purchasing and production. The work of, and interaction between, 
the pillars is controlled by procedures and rules, and co-ordinated by the pediment of a 
small band of senior managers. Role or job description is often more important than the 
individual, and position is the main source of power.
● Task culture is job orientated or project orientated. In terms of structure, the task culture can be 
likened to a net, some strands of which are stronger than others, and with much of the power 
and influence at the interstices. An example is the matrix organisation. Task culture seeks to 
bring together the right resources and people, and utilises the unifying power of the group. 
Influence is widely spread and based more on expert power than on position or personal power.
● Person culture is where the individual is the central focus and any structure exists to serve 
the individuals within it. When a group of people decide that it is in their own interests to 
band together to do their own thing and share office space, equipment or clerical assistance, 
then the resulting organisation would have a person culture. Examples are groups of bar-
risters, architects, doctors or consultants. Although it is found in only a few organisations, 
many individuals have a preference for person culture – for example, university professors 
and specialists. Management hierarchies and control mechanisms are possible only by 
mutual consent. Individuals have almost complete autonomy and any influence over them is 
likely to be on the basis of personal power.
Every organisation will have its own unique culture and most large businesses are likely to be 
something of a mix of cultures, with examples for each of the four types in varying areas of 
the organisation. Different people enjoy working in different types of organisational culture 
and they are more likely to be happy and satisfied at work if their attributes and personalities 
are consistent with the culture of that part of the organisation in which they are employed.
Four generic types of culture
From an examination of hundreds of business organisations and their environments, Deal 
and Kennedy categorise corporate cultures according to two determining factors in the 
marketplace:
● the degree of risk associated with the organisation’s activities; and
● the speed at which organisations and their employees receive feedback on the success of 
decisions or strategies.

Chapter 15  Organisational culture and change
541
These factors give rise to four generic types of culture: the tough-guy, macho culture; the 
work-hard/play-hard culture; the bet-your-company culture; and the process culture.10
● Tough-guy, macho culture – an organisation of individualists who frequently take high 
risks and receive quick feedback on the right or wrong of their actions. Examples cited 
include police departments, surgeons, construction, cosmetics, management consulting 
and the entertainment industry. Financial stakes are high and there is a focus on speed. The 
intense pressure and frenetic pace often result in early ‘burnout’. Internal competition and 
conflict are normal, stars are temperamental but tolerated. A high staff turnover can create 
difficulties in building a strong cohesive culture.
● Work-hard/play-hard culture – characterised by fun and action where employees take few 
risks, all with quick feedback. There is a high level of relatively low-risk activity. Examples 
include sales organisations such as estate agents and computer companies, mass-consumer 
companies such as McDonald’s, office equipment manufacturers and retail stores. Organi-
sations tend to be highly dynamic and the primary value centres on customers and their 
needs. It is the team that produces the volume, and the culture encourages games, meetings, 
promotions and conventions to help maintain motivation. However, although a lot gets 
done, volume can be at the expense of quality.
● Bet-your-company culture – where there are large-stake decisions with a high risk but 
slow feedback so that it may be years before employees know if decisions were successful. 
Examples include oil companies, investment banks, architectural firms and the military. 
The focus is on the future and the importance of investing in it. There is a sense of deliber-
ateness throughout the organisation, typified by the ritual of the business meeting. There 
is a hierarchical system of authority, with decision-making from the top down. The culture 
leads to high-quality inventions and scientific breakthroughs, but moves only very slowly 
and is vulnerable to short-term fluctuations.
● Process culture – a low-risk, slow-feedback culture where employees find difficulty in meas-
uring what they do. Typical examples include insurance companies, financial services and 
the civil service. The individual financial stakes are low and employees get very little feed-
back on their effectiveness. Their memos and reports seem to disappear into a void. Lack 
of feedback forces employees to focus on how they do something, not what they do. People 
tend to develop a ‘cover your back’ mentality. Bureaucracy results, with attention to trivial 
events, minor detail, formality and technical perfection. Process cultures can be effective 
when there is a need for order and predictability.
Criticisms of cultural typologies
Some writers are critical of the generic typologies of culture that suggest organisations have a 
single overriding cultural environment representative of management ideology and all stake-
holders. The complex nature of organisations may give rise to many different cultures and 
overlapping and/or conflicting sub-cultures, including ways in which members of staff distin-
guish themselves within the organisation.
A notable critic of a unitary approach to a dominate culture imposed by senior manage-
ment is Smircich, who uses the metaphor of a plant root. Culture is something that ‘is’ and has 
developed and spread (like plant roots), together with an organisation’s history, structure and 
staff. It is culture that drives organisations and shapes their structure and interactions. Smir-
cich views culture as usually defined hierarchically and is elevated as a critical variable that 
controls the nature of organisational life, and determines its performance and effectiveness.11
Martin contrasts an integrationist perspective of a single unified culture as a basis for 
organisational effectiveness with a differentiation or pluralistic perspective that views organi-
sational culture in terms of diverse interest groups within their own objectives.12 Parker also 
suggests that rather than a strong single culture, organisations possess multiple sub-cultures 
that may overlap or contradict each other. An organisation’s culture may also be perceived dif-
ferently in terms of either the formal or informal structure (see Chapter 3).13

 Inﬂ uences on the development of culture 
 The culture and structure of an organisation develop over time and in response to a complex 
set of factors. We can, however, identify a number of key infl uences that are likely to play 
an important role in the development of any corporate culture. These include history, pri-
mary function and technology, strategy, size, location, management and leadership, and the 
environment. 14 
 ●  History. The reason and manner in which the organisation was originally formed, its age 
and the philosophy and values of its owners and fi rst senior managers will aff ect culture. 
A key event in the organisation’s history such as a merger or major reorganisation, or a 
new generation of top management, may bring about a change in culture. Corporate his-
tory can be an eff ective induction tool to assist a growth programme, and to help integrate 
acquisitions and new employees by infusion with the organisation’s culture and identity. 15 
Failure in mergers and acquisitions can arise from cultural clashes and failure to integrate 
diff erent cultures. 16 
 ●  Primary function and technology. The nature of the organisation’s ‘business’ and its pri-
mary function have an important infl uence on its culture. This includes the range and 
quality of products and services provided, the importance of reputation and the type of 
customers. The primary function of the organisation will determine the nature of the tech-
nological processes and methods of undertaking work, which in turn also aff ect structure 
and culture. 
 ●  Strategy. Although a business organisation may pursue profi tability, this is not by itself very 
clear or a suffi  cient criterion for its eff ective management. For example, to what extent is 
emphasis placed on long-term survival or growth and development? How much attention 
is given to avoiding risks and uncertainties? Or how much concern is shown for broader 
social responsibilities? The organisation must give attention to objectives in all key areas of 
its operations. The combination of objectives and resultant strategies will infl uence culture, 
and may itself be infl uenced by changes in culture.  (See also  Chapter  14 .) 
 ●  Size.  Usually larger organisations have more formalised structures and cultures. Increased 
size is likely to result in separate departments and possibly split-site operations. This may 
cause diffi  culties in communication and interdepartmental rivalries, with the need for eff ec-
tive co-ordination. A rapid expansion, or decline, in size and rate of growth, and resultant 
changes in staffi  ng, will infl uence structure and culture. 
 ●  Location. Geographical location and physical characteristics can have a major infl uence on 
culture – for example, whether an organisation is located in a quiet rural location or a busy 
city centre can infl uence the types of customers and the staff  employed. An example could 
be a hotel or restaurant. Location can also aff ect the nature of services provided, the sense 
of ‘boundary’ and distinctive identity, and opportunities for development. 
 ●  Management and leadership. Top executives can have considerable infl uence on the nature 
of corporate culture. Examples are the key roles played by Sir Richard Branson, Anita Rod-
dick, founder of The Body Shop, and Marjorie Scardino and her change of style when she 
took over as the new chief executive of Pearson. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 attempting to analyse culture in terms of different levels or generic typologies is too simplistic and prescriptive. it 
serves no useful purpose in evaluating applications of management and organisational behaviour. 
 What do YOU think? How would YOU analyse the culture of YOUR own university or organisation? 

Chapter 15  Organisational culture and change

Her candour works . . . As an example of straight talking winning over a sceptical City 
and press, it is brilliant. As an example of just how much a company’s culture can change 
under a new chief executive, it is breathtaking.17
 
Another example is Louis Gerstner, who remade the ossified culture of computing giant 
IBM bred by the company’s success, rebuilt the leadership team and gave the workforce 
a renewed sense of purpose.18 A further example is Harriet Green, who between 2012 
and 2014 completely transformed the financial fortunes of travel operator Thomas Cook. 
Before her appointment as CEO, Thomas Cook was described by the Financial Times as ‘a 
near-death experience’. Such was the impact of Harriet Green that after her sudden depar-
ture £360 million was wiped off the share price of the company.
 
However, all members of staff help to shape the dominant culture of an organisation, 
irrespective of what senior management feel it should be. Culture is also determined by 
the nature of staff employed and the extent to which they accept management philosophy 
and policies or pay only ‘lip service’. Another important influence is the match between 
corporate culture and employees’ perception of the psychological contract (discussed in 
Chapter 1).
● The environment. In order to be effective, the organisation must be responsive to exter-
nal environmental influences. For example, if the organisation operates within a dynamic 
environment it requires a structure and culture that are sensitive and readily adaptable to 
change. An organic structure is more likely to respond effectively to new opportunities and 
challenges, and risks and limitations presented by the external environment. (Recall the 
discussion on mechanistic and organic systems in Chapter 11.)
The cultural web
In order to help describe and understand the culture of an organisation, Johnson et al. present 
a cultural web, which brings together different aspects for the analysis of organisational cul-
ture (see Figure 15.3).

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
● Routine behaviours – the ways in which members of the organisation behave towards each 
other and towards those outside the organisation and that make up how things are done or 
how things should happen.
● Rituals – the particular activities or special events through which the organisation empha-
sises what is particularly important; can include formal organisational processes and infor-
mal processes.
● Stories told by members of the organisation that embed the present and flag up important 
events and personalities, and typically have to do with successes, failures, heroes, villains 
and mavericks.
● Symbols – such as logos, offices, cars, titles, type of language or terminology commonly 
used, which become a shorthand representation of the nature of the organisation.
● Power structures – the power of the most powerful individuals or groups in the organisa-
tion, which may be based on management position and seniority, but in some organisations 
power can be lodged with other levels or functions.
● Control systems – the measurement and reward systems that emphasise what it is impor-
tant to monitor, and to focus attention and activity upon, for example, stewardship of 
funds or quality of service.
● Organisational structure – which reflects power structures and delineates important rela-
tionships and activities within the organisation, and involves both formal structure and 
control and less formal systems.
● The paradigm of the organisation, which encapsulates and reinforces the behaviours 
observed in other elements of the cultural web.19
Culture and organisational control
A number of writers have referred to an alternative view of culture as a means of organisa-
tional control. For example, Cartwright sees culture as a system of management authority. 
When accepted by employees, cultural values increase the power and authority of manage-
ment in three ways. Employees:
● identify themselves with their organisation and accept its rules when ‘it is the right thing to do’;
● internalise the organisation’s values when they believe they are right; and
● are motivated to achieve the organisation’s objectives.20
Egan refers to culture as the largest organisational control system that dictates how crazy or 
idiosyncratic people can be. Companies and institutions have both an overt and covert culture 
that influences both business and organisational behaviour.
The covert set can be quite dysfunctional and costly. Culture – the assumptions, beliefs, values 
and norms that drive ‘the way we do things here’ – is the largest and most controlling of the 
systems because it affects not only overt organisational behaviour but also the shadow-side 
behaviour . . . Culture lays down norms for the social system. In one institution you had to 
be an engineer to rise to the top. There was no published rule, of course, it was just the way 
things were. In one bank you could never be made an officer of the company if you wore 
polyester clothes. Culture tells us what kind of politics is allowed and just how members of an 
organisation are allowed to play the political game.21
Watson refers to the cultural design of an organisation and the link between direct and indi-
rect controls. In a highly centralised organisation with a tight bureaucratic structure and cul-
ture, there would be an emphasis on direct controls with prescribed rules and procedures, and 
a low level of psychological commitment from employees. In a less centralised organisation 
with a loosely bureaucratic structure and culture, there would be more attention to indirect 
controls with relatively loose rules and procedures, greater flexibility and discretion, and a 
culture of high-level commitment.22 

Chapter 15 OrganisatiOnal culture and change
545
 Two diﬀ erent forms of culture 
 ACAS distinguishes two diff erent organisational cultures and diff erent ways of doing things: 
 ●  control culture with the emphasis on rules and procedures, control and compliance with 
precedent providing guidelines; and 
 ●  quality of working life culture with the emphasis on core values, with mission statements 
providing guidance and commitment via shared goals, values and traditions. 23 
 Kershaw contrasts rules-based or values-based culture. 
  In rules-based cultures, people follow the rules and procedures assuming they are in place 
for good reasons and will achieve results. Examples of this type of organisation are the emer-
gency services and the military. However, some companies may have a rules-based bias as 
a result of the regulatory nature of the work they undertake, or even because of a particular 
management style. In value-driven organisations, there is a ‘code of conduct’ made up of a 
number of values that set out expected behaviours. People should understand the values of 
the organisation so that they know how to behave and perform to achieve objectives. . .  
Diverse organisations need a mix of ‘command and control’ and ‘culture and values’ to be 
successful. 24 
  The importance of culture 
 Applications of organisational behaviour and eff ective management of people are depend-
ent not only upon the nature of the industry or business, but also upon the characteristic 
features of the individual organisation – and its culture. The pervasive nature of culture 
in terms of ‘how things are done around here’ and common values, beliefs and attitudes 
will therefore have a signifi cant eff ect on organisational processes such as decision-making, 
design of structure, group behaviour, work organisation, motivation and job satisfaction, 
and management control. With increasing globalisation, work organisations are becoming 
even more complex and internationally based. There is greater emphasis on the understand-
ing and management of a diverse group of people from diff erent nationalities into a coher-
ent culture. 
 Reigle refers to culture as an important factor in successful technology implementation, 
innovation, mergers, acquisitions, job satisfaction, organisational success and team eff ective-
ness, and to the importance of determining whether organisations exhibit organic or mecha-
nistic cultures. 25 
 Culture and work ethic 
 Culture can infl uence people’s attitudes and behaviour at work.  Bunting draws attention to 
the link between work ethic  (discussed in  Chapter  1 ) and culture, and the extent to which 
people have a choice over how hard they work. Although some people have no choice, 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 the idea that culture is a form of management control over the behaviour and identities of individuals is far too 
nebulous. it all depends on the personality and actions of immediate supervisors and/or senior managers. 
 What is YOUR considered opinion? To what extent do YOU believe your organisation’s culture asserts control over 
YOUR behaviour? 

546
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
for the vast majority of people there is a degree of choice but the choices are not made in 
isolation:
they are the product of the particular organisational culture of our workplaces, which pro-
mote concepts of success, of team spirit so that we don’t let colleagues down, and a powerful 
work ethic. We are also influenced by a culture that reinforces that work ethic and its cycle of 
continual achievement and consumption as measures of self-worth.
Bunting maintains that it is through work that we seek to satisfy our craving for a sense of 
control, mastery and security, and that clever organisations exploit this cultural context by 
designing corporate cultures that meet the emotional needs of their employees.26
The culture of the organisation is also important in determining the behaviour of man-
agers and how well the organisation works. Brodbeck refers to a blame culture that exists 
in many organisations and where the brickbats fly more often than the bouquets. Such 
organisations are a very unhealthy environment in which to work. For example, an organi-
sation may see low reports of errors as a healthy sign but in reality this is because indi-
viduals are worried about reporting mistakes. Improving the safety culture and a climate of 
proactive error management will encourage individuals to see the benefits when errors are 
pinpointed.27
The Core Partnership suggests that the kind of culture existing within an organisation can 
be gauged by the amount of time employees are expected to work past their core hours. This is 
often considered as an unwritten law. A culture that encourages bottom-sharing of new ideas 
contributes to employee morale.28
The competitive environment and concerns about job security have contributed to a pre-
vailing work culture of ‘presenteeism’. In many organisations working long hours is seen as 
a necessary feature of acceptable behaviour and career progression. Presenteeism does not 
necessarily imply physical presence at your place of work, but ready availability at most hours, 
including weekends and evenings, by email and mobile.
National cultural environment (discussed in Chapter 1) can have a noticeable effect on pres-
enteeism. As the author experienced for himself in Australia, work-related activities are often 
undertaken comfortably away from the workplace, in local coffee houses for example, without 
concern about not being seen by management. This is in contrast to the typical work ethic 
throughout much of the USA, where again the author experienced the almost obsessive con-
cern for always being seen about the place.
Culture and organisational performance
Culture is clearly an important ingredient of effective organisational performance. Stanford 
suggests that although people have difficulty in explaining why, intuitively they know that ‘yes, 
of course’ culture matters. It is an intangible asset that is both distinctive to that organisation 
and adds value to it (or diminishes value). Ten typical characteristics that form the typical 
organisation culture are: a story or stories, a purpose, a set of values, an attitude to people, a 
global mindset, a relationship network, a digital presence, a reputation, a customer proposi-
tion and a horizon-scanning ability. Although links between culture and business success are 
difficult to prove, Stanford maintains that even when there is a strong and healthy culture, a 
business cannot be successful if there is a flawed business model. However, with a strong and 
healthy culture there is less likelihood of a flawed business model.29
Hilton believes there is a stronger link and that companies succeed because of their culture. 
Most management systems, such as risk management, neglect the importance of culture and 
treat business as a mechanical operation when its outcomes depend fundamentally on the way 
people behave and interact.
The key to understanding any business is to understand its culture, yet often it is the most 
neglected and taken for granted part. Companies succeed because of their culture, they 

Chapter 15 OrganisatiOnal culture and change
547
decline because of their culture and if there were to be any single reason advanced for the 
failure of two thirds of mergers and acquisitions, it would probably be the incompatibility in 
culture of the businesses. 30 
 As  Clifton points out, an organisation’s culture, whether offi  cially defi ned and promoted or 
just established organically, will determine a whole range of performance indicators. A happy 
and engaged workforce is widely acknowledged to outperform one where negativity and offi  ce 
politics thrive: ‘Business leaders should re-evaluate the importance of culture when embarking 
on any change management programme focused on performance improvement.’ 31  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 the extent to which an individual’s needs and expectations at work are compatible with the culture of an organisa-
tion is probably the most important determinant of motivation and job satisfaction. 
 Are YOU able to challenge this assertion? How important is the culture of YOUR university to YOUR general state of 
well-being and to your studies? 
 National and international culture 
 With greater global competition, an understanding of national culture has become of increas-
ing importance for managers.  Schneider and Barsoux suggest that cultural beliefs and val-
ues infl uence the meaning of management and also show up diff erences in conceptions of 
organisations. National diff erences and cultural reasons raise concerns about the transferabil-
ity of organisational structures, systems and processes, and question the logic of universal 
‘best practice’. 32 Cheng et al. also question the universality of theories of management and 
organisational behaviour on the grounds that they have not adequately addressed the factor 
of culture. 33 
 According to  Francesco and Gold, culture has recently been accepted as an explanation 
of organisational behaviour. One reason is the increase in competitiveness of nations and a 
second reason is that managers encounter diff erent cultures in their contacts with people from 
other nations. However, there are limits to the use of culture to explain organisational behav-
iour, and the relationship between national cultural values and actual behaviour in organisa-
tions is complex. 34 
 Menzies points out that understanding the culture of doing business in a particular country 
can give you the upper hand. While the cultural diff erences in doing business abroad represent 
one of the biggest barriers to effi  cient working, these barriers can be easily overcome by taking 
the time to understand the nuances of business culture, including diff erent legal frameworks 
and local business culture and language. 35 
 The CIPD points out that an increase in travel and technology and the international broad-
casting of television channels has led to a blurring of some distinctions of culture. However, there 
are still clearly defi nable diff erences in culture between diff erent countries and ethnic groups. 
 Although the outward signs of work (dress, technology, etc.) might be increasingly similar 
regardless of the country of origin, there are many ways in which people can be off ended, and 
business propositions damaged, if there is not an understanding of the culture of the country 
in which the activities are being conducted. 36 
 See the discussion on language as part of culture in  Chapter  6 , and culture as a contingent fac-
tor of leadership in  Chapter  9 . See also the case study on Brazil below.

A generic model of cultural categorisation
With the wide range of national cultures and regional variations, and a world of rapidly glo-
balising business, Lewis draws attention to the importance of cross-cultural training and a 
generic model of cultural categorisation. His model classifies cultures under three main head-
ings: linear-actives; multi-actives; and reactives (see Figure 15.4).
● Linear-active people tend to be task-orientated, highly organised planners who complete 
action chains doing one thing at a time. They prefer straightforward and direct discussion, 
adhere to logic rather than emotion, have faith in rules and regulations, honour written 
contracts and are process orientated.
● Multi-active people are emotional, loquacious and impulsive, and attach great importance 
to family, feelings and relationships. They like to do many things at the same time. Rela-
tionships and connections are more important than products. They have limited respect for 
authority, often procrastinate, are flexible and often change their plans.
● Reactive people are listeners who rarely initiate action or discussion. They concentrate on 
what is being said, listen before they leap and show respect. Reactives are introverts and 
adept at non-verbal communications. Silence is regarded as a meaningful part of discourse. 
Smalltalk is not easy and lack of eye contact is typical.37

Full of colour and rhythm, Brazil has become the 
new land of opportunity in South America. Currently 
the seventh largest economy in the world, Brazil is 
wrought by its diverse culture and geography. Its grow-
ing economy is a thriving fusion of Portuguese, African 
and indigenous Indian influences, all of which have 
left their mark on Brazilian society. When in Brazil to 
do business, having an understanding of the diversity 
of its society and the unique values and attitudes of its 
citizens will help you to develop better relationships 
and do business more successfully with your Brazilian 
colleagues.
Under its motto ‘Ordem e Progresso’, Brazilian 
culture is known for its hospitality, openness and tra-
ditional events, such as the carnival. The climate of 
Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions 
across a large area and a varied topography, but most 
of the country is tropical. It is important to appreciate 
that the Brazilian football team is a key component of 
national pride. As such you shouldn’t schedule a busi-
ness meeting during a soccer match and you should 
always comment about the game when on a confer-
ence call.
In Brazil family is at the centre of the social struc-
ture. Families in Brazil tend to be large and close-knit, 
providing members with security and connections. 
The importance of family is also evident in Brazilian 
business culture, where family members will often be 
found working for the same company, whether or not 
it is family-owned.
Relationships are one of the most important ele-
ments of Brazilian business culture. It is essential 
therefore to spend time getting to know your Brazil-
ian counterparts, both personally and professionally. 
By cultivating close personal relationships and build-
ing trust, you will have a greater chance of successfully 
doing business in Brazil.
When you meet someone for the first time, it is 
polite to say ‘muito prazer’ (my pleasure). Expressions 
such as ‘como vai’ and ‘tudo bem’ are common forms 
of saying hello once you know someone and can dem-
onstrate that you are making an effort to develop a 
relationship with a person. The use of titles and first 
names varies across Brazilian society. It is polite to 
address your Brazilian counterpart with their title and 
surname at the first meeting or when writing to them. 
Once you know them, it is common to use just first 
names, or else their title followed by their first name.
Advancing your company’s relationship with a 
Brazilian company may rest upon your ability to gain 
trust. So, on your next meeting, remember to make 
eye contact, as this shows you are paying attention 
and are interested and honest. Make sure to accept 
any food or coffee that is offered to you, saying no can 
be seen as insulting. Do not show feelings of frustra-
tion or impatience as this will reflect poorly on you 
as an individual. Brazilians pride themselves on their 
ability to be in control, so acting in a similar fashion 
will improve your relationship with your Brazilian 
counterparts.
You should bear in mind that Brazilian companies 
tend to have vertical hierarchies, where managers at 
the top make most of the decisions. These positions 
tend to be dominated by men, but women are slowly 
gaining employment in executive roles.
Time in Brazil is approached in a flexible manner; 
punctuality and defined plans are not common. This 
carries over into business, which can result in nego-
tiations taking much longer than scheduled. Meetings 
are also often delayed or cancelled without any prior 
warning.
Finally, Fique tranquilo, if Brazilians value any single 
trait, it’s optimism and being able to solve problems. 
If the problem can’t be fixed, you should just relax and 
forget about it. At the first signs of someone becoming 
stressed, a Brazilian will often say: Fique tranquilo (fee-
kee kdang-kwee-loh), which means don’t worry; it has 
a very calming effect.

 Organisational climate 
 In addition to arrangements for the carrying out of organisational processes, management 
have a responsibility for creating a climate in which people are motivated to work willingly 
and eff ectively. Organisational climate is another general concept and diffi  cult to defi ne pre-
cisely. It is more something that is felt. It is often likened to our description of the weather 
and the way in which the climate of a geographical region results from the combination of 
environmental forces. Some of these forces are better understood than others. In a similar way 
that culture was defi ned simply as ‘how things are done around here’, climate can be defi ned 
as ‘how it feels to work around here’. 
 Both culture and climate relate to the value-system of the organisation and both have an 
infl uence on the behaviour of its members.  Organisational climate can be said to relate to 
the prevailing atmosphere surrounding the organisation, to the level of morale and to the 
strength of feelings of belonging, care and goodwill among members. Climate will infl uence 
the attitudes that members of the organisation bring to bear on their work performance and 
personal relationships. The extent to which employees accept the culture of the organisation 
will have a signifi cant eff ect on climate. Whereas organisational culture describes what the 
organisation is about, organisational climate is an indication of the employees’ feelings and 
beliefs of what the organisation is about. According to  Tagiuri and Litwin, climate is based on 
the perceptions of members towards the organisation. 
 Organizational climate is a relatively enduring quality of the internal environment of an 
organization that (a) is experienced by its members, (b) infl uences their behavior, and (c) can 
be described in terms of the values of a particular set of characteristics (or attributes) of the 
organization. 38 
 Characteristics of a healthy organisational climate 
 Organisational climate is characterised, therefore, by the nature of the people–organisation 
relationship and the superior–subordinate relationship. These relationships are determined 
by interactions among goals and objectives, formal structure, the process of management, 
styles of leadership and the behaviour of people. Although similar types of organisations 
will share certain common features and norms, each organisation will have its own diff erent 
and  distinctive features. In general terms, however, a healthy organisational climate might be 
expected to exhibit such characteristic features as set out in  Figure  15.5 . 
 A healthy climate will not by itself guarantee improved organisational eff ectiveness. How-
ever, an organisation is most unlikely to attain optimum operational performance unless 
the climate evokes a spirit of support and co-operation throughout the organisation, and is 
conducive to motivating members to work willingly and eff ectively.  Gray maintains from his 
research to have found a clear correlation between successful workplace outcomes and a range 
of climate characteristics and that a climate conducive to successful outcomes also tends to be

its value to our understanding of organisational behaviour. it is too ambiguous a concept for the effective day-to-day

conducive to individual happiness. The climate of an organisation has a significant impact on 
the quality and quantity of work that gets done and on the well-being of employees.39
Six dimensions of climate
Atkinson and Frechette of Forum Corporation maintain there is a direct correlation between 
organisational climate and financial results. A healthy climate increases employee motivation, 
catalysing more effective performance. Research by Forum identifies six dimensions that influ-
ence the work environment and employee motivation:
● Clarity – people’s degree of understanding of the organisation’s goals and policies, as well 
as the requirement of their job.
● Commitment – the expression of continuing dedication to a common purpose and to 
achieving goals.
● Standards – the emphasis management place on high-performance standards and the 
amount of pressure it exerts on teams to improve performance.
● Responsibility – the degree to which people feel personally responsible for their work.
● Recognition – the feeling that people are recognised and rewarded for doing good work, 
and that they receive accurate performance feedback.
● Teamwork – the feeling of belonging to an organisation characterised by cohesion, mutual 
support, trust and pride.
A corporate imperative now is to cultivate a positive organisational climate in a negative 
economic one. Successful leaders take pains to ignite a chain reaction that improves climate, 
increases motivation and enhances performance. Strong leaders have the motivation and influ-
ence skills to develop the workforce in these six measurable dimensions.40
Organisational change
Change is an inevitable and constant feature. It is an inescapable part of both social and organ-
isational life and we are all subject to continual change of one form or another. Like it or not, 
change happens. Change is also a pervasive influence and much of the following discussion 
provides links with other topics in other chapters. The effects of change can be studied over 
different time scales, from weeks to hundreds of years, and studied at different levels. Change

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
can be studied in terms of its effects at the individual, group, organisation, society, national or 
international level. However, because of its pervasive nature, change at any one level is inter-
related with changes at other levels, and it is difficult to study one area of change in isolation.
At the individual level there could, for example, be a personal transformational change 
where circumstances have not changed, but because of some emotional or spiritual happening 
the individual was transformed or changed. This transformation may have some effect on the 
individual’s behaviour and actions at work and relationships with colleagues. But our main 
focus of attention is on the management of organisational change. Organisational change 
can be initiated deliberately by managers, it can evolve slowly within a department, it can be 
imposed by specific changes in policy or procedures, or it can arise through external pressures. 
Change can affect all aspects of the operation and functioning of the organisation.41
Forces of change
An organisation can perform effectively only through interactions with the broader exter-
nal environment of which it is part. The structure and functioning of the organisation must 
reflect, therefore, the nature of the environment in which it is operating. Factors that create an 
increasingly volatile environment include:
● uncertain economic conditions;
● globalisation and fierce world competition;
● the level of government intervention;
● EU influences and social legislation;
● political interests;
● scarcity of natural resources;
● rapid developments in new technologies and the information age.
In order to help ensure its survival and future success the organisation must be readily adapt-
able to the external demands placed upon it. The organisation must be responsive to change. 
Other major forces of change include:
● increased demands for quality and high levels of customer service and satisfaction;
● greater flexibility in the structure of work organisations and patterns of management;
● the changing nature and composition of the workforce;
● social and cultural influences such as diversity, equality and inclusion;
● conflict from within the organisation.
According to Dan Wagner, change is good:
It is the whole dynamic that creates successful companies in the first place, whether you are 
trying to do something differently or more efficiently, or something that leverages the tech-
nology that has become prevalent to do something better.
And according to Duncan Tait:
It is always better to lead change than react to it, in my experience, because the later you 
leave it to react to change, the more severe your actions have to be.42
Economic change in the EU
The European Commission points out that today all economic sectors face the permanent 
effects of economic change, which may be cyclical, structural or related to globalisation. In 
the past companies have had to change to adapt to specific events such as new technology or 
manufacturing process, but now change no longer constitutes a response to a specific crisis. 
Change has become permanent.
Economic change cannot be managed by preserving old practices but requires the develop-
ment of common approaches and modern practices, and to generalise a proactive culture of 

Chapter 15 OrganisatiOnal culture and change
553
anticipating change. In order to refl ect the changed and changing environment, the EU is likely 
to face a number of challenges including fi nding the necessary skills to allow the European 
economy to remain competitive in the global market. The EU makes a range of funds available 
to Member States in order to support restructuring and works within a body of legislation, 
including information and consultation of workers on changes likely to aff ect them. 43  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 continuing organisational change is inevitable. it is nothing new and a simple fact of life. there is no point in dwell-
ing on the subject. it is easier just to accept the need to adapt to change as part of your working life. 
 To what extent are YOU in agreement? How readily are YOU able to adapt to change? 
 Planned organisational change 
 Change also originates within the organisation itself. Much of this change is part of a natural 
process of ageing – for example: as material resources such as buildings, equipment or machin-
ery deteriorate or lose effi  ciency; or as human resources get older; or as skills and abilities 
become outdated. Some of this change can be managed through careful planning – for exam-
ple, regular repairs and maintenance, choice of introducing new technology or methods of 
work, eff ective HR planning to prevent a large number of staff  retiring at the same time, and 
management succession planning – training and staff  development. However, the main pressure 
of change is usually from external forces. The organisation must be properly prepared to face 
the demands of a changing environment. It must give attention to its future development and 
success; this includes public-sector organisations and the armed forces. 
 A concept map of sources of organisational change is presented in  Figure  15.6 . 
 Most planned organisational change is triggered by the need to respond to new challenges 
or opportunities presented by the external environment, or in anticipation of the need to cope 
with potential future problems, for example uncertain economic conditions, intended govern-
ment legislation, new product development by a major competitor or further technological 
advances. Planned change represents an intentional attempt to improve, in some important 
way, the operational eff ectiveness of the organisation. 
 The basic underlying objectives can be seen in general terms as: 
 ●  modifying the behavioural patterns of members of the organisation; and 
 ●  improving the ability of the organisation to cope with changes in its environment. 
 Behaviour modiﬁ cation 
 A programme of planned change and improved performance developed by  Lewin involves the 
management of a three-phase process of behaviour modifi cation: 
 ●  unfreezing – reducing those forces that maintain behaviour in its present form, recognition 
of the need for change and improvement to occur; 
 ●  movement – development of new attitudes or behaviour and the implementation of the 
change; 
 ●  refreezing – stabilising change at the new level and reinforcement through supporting 
mechanisms, for example policies, structure or norms. 44 
 French et al.  list eight specifi c components of a planned-change eff ort related to the above 
process ( see  Figure  15.7 ). 45

 HARRIET GREEN 
 CHIEF EXECUTIVE
THOMAS COOK 
  
 Harriet Green told the Commission about her personal ‘transformation toolkit’, which she has used to overhaul a 
number of organisations on diﬀ erent continents, including Thomas Cook. 
 ‘Driving transformation is a 24/7 job,’ she said. ‘Organisations are like living organisms and, when looking to transform 
them, you need to consider all elements, whilst addressing the most urgent priorities.’ The critical three elements are: 
 The psychology : how people think, feel and act — in other words, the organisation’s culture, values, ways of work-
ing and ‘the way we get things done round here’. 
 The physiology : the systems and processes that underpin and connect the business, like nerve endings and blood ﬂ ows. 
 And, ﬁ nally,  its anatomy : the organisational structure. Businesses need to create a lean, agile structure as beﬁ ts a 
digitally enabled business, supporting fast decision-making, and reducing the layers of management between the 
CEO and customers. 
 Harriet believes a CEO must lead change in all three areas to truly transform the organisation. An eﬀ ective CEO 
today needs to operate at the centre of the vortex — not from the top of the pyramid in a historical, hierarchi-
cal construct — and has to gather information from all the organisation’s communities, both internal and external. 
 ‘Organisations are like living organisms and, when looking to transform them, you need to consider all elements, whilst 
addressing the most urgent priorities.’ 
 Harriet described some of the key ‘tools’ in her personal leadership toolkit that are helping her to drive the ongo-
ing turnaround at Thomas Cook. 
 Investigate the problem 
 On her ﬁ rst day as CEO, Harriet sent a survey to everyone in the business asking what was wrong with it. In under a month, 
over 8,000 people had replied. Those at the frontline usually know what’s not working and have a passion for ﬁ xing it.  
 Be visible 
 Communicate often, update the organisation regularly, and use diﬀ erent media, like video. Be available and reply 
quickly. Be visible, share honestly and celebrate success. 
 Be open 
 Ensure you are open to feedback from employees. At Thomas Cook, Harriet developed an ‘Ask Harriet’ email 
address, so employees could email in conﬁ dence on any issue. At its peak, Harriet received 200 emails a day and 
prides herself on replying to everyone.

(1985), p. 9. 
 French, Kast and Rosenzweig refer to eight speciﬁ c stages of a planned-change eﬀ ort 
related to the above process. 
 ●  Unfreezing relates to the stages of (1) initial problem identiﬁ cation and (2) obtaining 
data. 
 ●  Movement relates also to stage (2) obtaining data; and stages (3) problem diagnosis, 
(4) action planning, (5) implementation, (6) follow-up and stabilisation, and (7) assessment 
of consequences. 
 ●  Refreezing relates also to stage (7) assessment of consequences; and (8) learning from 
the process.

 Identify talent 
 leaders need to identify their talented performers quickly. engage with people across the organisation — meet the 
key players in every area, know their direct reports, and meet with up and coming talent. identify quickly those who 
are not ‘on the bus’—make decisions quickly. When transforming an organisation, moving at pace is essential—don’t 
waste time trying to convert those managers and leaders who don’t want to change and who make it clear that they 
will never support the new ways. give everyone a fair chance to change but then take the tough decisions. Middle-
management is often a big part of the problem—and also the solution. By engaging and fostering belief at the top 
and the bottom of the organisation, those in the middle who might be slower to change begin to feel the squeeze 
and move forward positively. 
 Build a winning team 
 Bringing in fresh talent, diff erent industry experience and a diff erent perspective is vitally important, as is identifying 
the skills and knowledge gaps early on. at thomas cook, harriet personally recruited close to 80 people, believing 
that, when transforming the leadership of an organisation, the principle of ‘a third, a third and a third’ is usually the 
right balance: keep one-third of the original leadership team, promote one-third from within and bring in one-third 
to give fresh perspective and learnings from other industries, and then involve and engage them to work together 
as one aligned team. 
 Develop the culture 
 From the very start, focus on the culture. develop and agree together the values and the ways of working. create a 
strong code of conduct and involve the whole organisation. everyone needs to clearly know what the organisation 
believes in, how it works and ‘how we do things round here’. together, these will create a culture and build trust. 
every employee needs to see themselves and their beliefs refl ected in the culture to succeed—like a fl amingo looking 
into a pool. develop clear leadership competencies to measure the performance of your leaders and enforce the 
code of conduct fairly and clearly for everyone without exception. lead with integrity and by example every day. Be 
a role model. 
 Break down barriers 
 silos and organisational politics have no place in transformations—build new teams, share best practice and encour-
age openness. 
 Celebrate success 
 remember to take time to celebrate success—it’s an important part of rebuilding belief, particularly in an organisa-
tion that’s been through a tough time. Pride in the company, its performance, its products and its services is impor-
tant for everyone. 
 Listen to stakeholders 
 never stop listening to your customers. never be so remote or so arrogant to think you can stop listening to any of 
your key stakeholders.

mation toolkit’. 
  2.  to what extent do you believe sending a survey to everyone in the business is  ordinarily likely to produce con-
structive and meaningful feedback? how well do you think this would work in your own university? 
  3.  What particular problems do you foresee in attempting to ‘create a strong code of conduct and involve the whole 
organisation’? 

Chapter 15  Organisational culture and change
557
Transformational change
Organisations may be faced with the need for large-scale transformational change involving a 
fundamental shift in the culture, conduct of business and working practices of the organisation. 
Transformational change is often enacted over a period of time. The CIPD reports on the increas-
ing demand for transformational change programmes as organisations emerge from the recession 
and once again seek more growth and development-orientated opportunities. Investment in change 
capability and capacity is essential for organisations wishing to have an ability to effect transforma-
tional change.46 See the Management and organisational behaviour in action case study.
The challenge of e-business
Whatever the future of e-business, it will continue to bring tremendous change. One of the biggest 
changes for managers, especially within large organisations, is learning how to get to grips with an 
increasingly flexible workforce. As a result of the e-business environment many people can work 
at any time, anywhere and at any place. Many employees work at home but although the virtual 
office may help organisations to cut costs, it also poses many management challenges, including the 
challenge to put structures in place to ensure regular meetings take place. Flexible working calls for 
flexible managers. This means that the traditional line managers need to become leaders, coaches 
and facilitators. Given the accelerating rate of change, particularly with the Internet, it is essential 
that organisations invest in and develop their managers to succeed with this change.
Continuous organisational change and burnout
Rees and Rumbles point out that the pace and scope of change have been unprecedented and 
they examine the extent to which continuous organisational change leads to organisational 
burnout. Organisational causes of burnout include excessive workload, lack of autonomy and 
authority, insufficient reward, and disparity between personal and organisational values. Burn-
out may also have a ‘spillover’ effect on people’s home lives. Rees and Rumbles question the 
extent to which organisations ‘care’ about the amount of stress that occurs during change and 
whether organisations can assess whether their human capital is close to burnout.
In terms of practical intervention, organisations must firstly have measures of measuring 
and evaluating organisational stress, and an understanding of the potential for organisational 
burnout. Organisations also need to determine how to get out of the burnout rut by becoming 
more resilient to change and engaging employees in a positive and productive manner in order 
to ensure long-term success. The involvement of managers in both preventing and dealing with 
the symptoms of burnout is paramount.47 (Organisational stress is discussed in Chapter 3.)
Resistance to change
Despite the potential positive outcomes, change is often resisted at both the individual and the 
organisational level. Resistance to change – or the thought of the implications of the change – 
appears to be a common phenomenon. As long ago as 1970, Toffler wrote about the psychologi-
cal dimension of ‘future shock’, and that people are naturally wary of change: ‘Among many 
there is an uneasy mood – a suspicion that change is out of control.’48
Resistance to change can take many forms and it is often difficult to pinpoint the exact 
reasons. The forces against change in work organisations include: ignoring the needs and 
expectations of members; when members have insufficient information about the nature of 
the change; or if they do not perceive the need for change. Fears may be expressed over such 
matters as employment levels and job security, de-skilling of work, loss of job satisfaction, 
wage-rate differentials, changes to social structures and working conditions, loss of individual 
control over work and greater management control.
Change is reciprocal, and changing organisations will affect the nature of managerial work. 
Lockhead maintains that ‘most successful organisations develop a culture that welcomes change 

558
part 4 structure, strategY and eFFectiVeness
and the opportunities it brings’. 49 However, according to  Crainer, many managers refuse to 
accept the necessity of change. Instead of being proactive, change is often reactive, the last resort. 
 Research repeatedly shows that it is managers who are the chief stumbling block to mak-
ing change happen. Changing organizational structures and managerial thinking challenges 
and undercuts traditional power bases . . . For the manager reared on the old functional 
certainties, the new world organization is very diffi  cult to manage. Indeed, the vast majority 
of managers are neither trained nor equipped to manage in such an environment. 50 
 The impact of change on work organisations and their management draws attention to the 
importance of lifelong learning and self-development  (discussed in  Chapter  5 ). 
 Individual resistance 
 Some common reasons for individual resistance to change within organisations include the 
following: 
 ●  Selective perception. People’s interpretation of stimuli presents a unique picture or image 
of the ‘real’ world. This can result in selective perception and lead to a biased view of a par-
ticular situation, which fi ts most comfortably into a person’s own perception of reality, and 
can cause resistance to change. For example, trade unionists may have a stereotyped view of 
management as untrustworthy and therefore oppose any management change, however well 
founded the intention might have been. Managers exposed to diff erent theories or ideas may 
tend to categorise these as either those they already practise and have no need to worry about, 
or those that are of no practical value and that can be discarded as of no concern to them.  
 ●  Habit. People tend to respond to situations in an established and accustomed manner. Hab-
its may serve as a means of comfort and security, and as a guide for easy decision-making. 
Old patterns are seductive. Proposed changes to habits, especially if the habits are well 
established and require little eff ort, may well be resisted. However, if there is a clearly per-
ceived advantage, for example a reduction in working hours without loss of pay, there is 
likely to be less, if any, resistance to the change, although some people may, because of 
habit, still fi nd it diffi  cult to adjust to the new times. 
 ●  Inconvenience or loss of freedom. If the change is seen as likely to prove inconvenient, make life 
more diffi  cult, reduce freedom of action or result in increased control, there will be resistance. 
 ●  Economic implications. People are likely to resist change that is perceived as reducing either 
directly or indirectly their pay or other rewards, requiring an increase in work for the same 
level of pay or acting as a threat to their job security. People tend to have established pat-
terns of working and a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. 
 ●  Security in the past. There is a tendency for some people to fi nd a sense of security in the 
past. In times of frustration or diffi  culty, or when faced with new or unfamiliar ideas or 
methods, people may refl ect on the past. There is a wish to retain old and comfortable 
ways. For example, in bureaucratic organisations offi  cials often tend to place faith in well-
established (‘tried and trusted’) procedures and cling to these as giving a feeling of security. 
 ●  Fear of the unknown.  Changes that confront people with the unknown tend to cause anxi-
ety or fear. Many major changes in a work organisation present a degree of uncertainty, for 
example the introduction of new technology or methods of working. A person may resist 
promotion because of uncertainty over changes in responsibilities or the increased social 
demands of the higher position. 
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 some people actively thrive on new challenges and constant change, while others prefer the comfort of the status 
quo and strongly resist any change. it is all down to the personality of the individual and there is little management 
can do about resistance to change. 
 What is YOUR attitude to change? To what extent do YOU welcome and accept, rather than resist, change? 

Chapter 15  Organisational culture and change
559
Organisational resistance
Although organisations have to adapt to their environment, they tend to feel comfortable 
operating within the structure, policies and procedures that have been formulated to deal with 
a range of present situations. To ensure operational effectiveness, organisations often set up 
defences against change and prefer to concentrate on the routine things they perform well. 
Some of the main reasons for organisational resistance against change are as follows:
● Organisational culture. Recall that the culture of an organisation develops over time and 
may not be easy to change. The pervasive nature of culture in terms of ‘how things are done 
around here’ also has a significant effect on organisational processes and the behaviour of 
staff. An outdated culture may result in a lack of flexibility for, or acceptance of, change.
● Maintaining stability. Organisations, especially large-scale ones, pay much attention to main-
taining stability and predictability. The need for formal structure and the division of work, 
narrow definitions of assigned duties and responsibilities, established rules, procedures and 
methods of work, can result in resistance to change. The more mechanistic or bureaucratic 
the structure, the less likely it is that the organisation will be responsive to change.
● Investment in resources. Change often requires large resources that may already be commit-
ted to investments in other areas or strategies. Assets such as buildings, technology, equip-
ment and people cannot easily be altered. For example, a manufacturer may not find it easy 
to change to a socio-technical approach and the use of autonomous work groups because it 
cannot afford the cost of a new purpose-built plant and specialised equipment.
● Past contracts or agreements. Organisations enter into contracts or agreements with other par-
ties, such as the government, other organisations, trade unions, suppliers and customers. These 
contracts and agreements can limit changes in behaviour – for example, organisations operat-
ing under a special licence or permit, or a fixed-price contract to supply goods/services to a 
government agency. Another example might be an agreement with unions that limits the oppor-
tunity to introduce redundancies, or the introduction of new technology or working practices.
● Threats to power or influence. Change may be seen as a threat to the power or influence of 
certain groups within the organisation, such as their control over decisions, resources or 
information. For example, managers may resist the introduction of worker-directors because 
they see this as increasing the role and influence of non-managerial staff, and a threat to the 
power in their own positions. Where a group of people have, over a period of time, estab-
lished what they perceive as their ‘territorial rights’, they are likely to resist change.
Perceptions and change
Although change is often resisted, Cunningham maintains that one of the greatest myths 
in management is the generalisation that people resist change. In fact people love change. 
The commonest reason for resistance is where people perceive a potential loss. For example, 
because of negative rumour-mongering, people may perceive that they will be worse off from a 
proposed change even if the opposite is in fact true. In a different context, changes that result, 
for example, in the loss of one’s job can create real, fact-based resistance. While people wel-
come change that they want, they have to be careful about the pace of change. In a more gen-
eral context people may be enthusiastic for change, for example in large organisations where 
some people want to see changes and improvements in communication.
What seems to get in the way is the continual chanting of the untrue generalisation that 
‘people resist change’. People resist some change – if they perceive that they are going to lose 
out. People welcome change that makes things better.51
Managing change
The successful management of change is clearly essential for continued economic perfor-
mance and competitiveness and is the life-blood of business success. New ideas and innova-
tions should not be perceived as threats by members of the organisation. Efforts to maintain 

560
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
the balance of the socio-technical system will influence people’s attitudes, the behaviour of 
individuals and groups, and thereby the level of organisational performance and effectiveness.
Many books and articles refer to the steps or actions to be taken to secure successful and 
sustainable change.52 The CMI provides a thirteen-point action checklist for the implementa-
tion of an effective change programme:
	1.	 Agree the implementation strategy.
	2.	 Agree timeframes.
	3.	 Draw up detailed implementation plans.
	4.	 Set up a team of change champions.
	5.	 Establish good programme management practices.
	6.	 Communicate clearly.
	7.	 Ensure participation and help to minimise stress.
	8.	 Personalise the case for change.
	9.	 Be prepared for conflict and manage it effectively.
	10.	 Motivate your employees.
	11.	 Develop skills.
	12.	 Maintain momentum.
	13.	 Monitor and evaluate.
The checklist aims to provide some generic guidance. It assumes a sound business case for 
change has been made, and the scope and objectives clearly defined. The detailed schedule for 
implementing change will vary according to both the type of organisation and the nature and 
scope of the changes planned.53
Toterhi and Recardo report that many business leaders continue to struggle with navigat-
ing their organisation through a change initiative. Despite increased awareness of change 
management processes, principles and practices, challenges from nine common blunders can 
significantly impede progress in achieving project goals:
Blunder 1. Accepting lucklustre leadership.
Blunder 2. Setting fire to perfectly good platforms.
Blunder 3. Treating change management as a separate workstream.
Blunder 4. Failing to align the organisation to support the change.
Blunder 5. Tolerating weak project management.
Blunder 6. Tolerating soft deadlines and weak metrics.
Blunder 7. Creating a convoluted plot.
Blunder 8. Failure to buy a warranty.
Blunder 9. Letting culture hold you hostage.
Toterhi and Recardo propose a road map of change, methodology, essential tasks and guide-
lines for change management.54
Minimising problems of change
People are the key factor in the successful management of change. If change is to work, it 
must change the perceptions, attitudes and behaviour of people. The effective management 
of change must be based on a clear understanding of human behaviour at work. Most people 
are not detached from their work but experience a range of emotional involvements through 
their membership of the organisation, and they feel threatened and disoriented by the chal-
lenge of change. Emotions such as uncertainty, frustration or fear are common reactions. It 
is understandable, therefore, that people often adopt a defensive and negative attitude, and 
demonstrate resistance to change. It is important to remember that change is a complex and 
powerful psychological experience, and that individuals react internally to change.

Chapter 15  Organisational culture and change
561
According to Atkinson, a major problem in driving change in organisations is dealing with 
and managing the resistance that will be encountered – but that resistance should be wel-
comed as a healthy response. Resistance is natural and should not be viewed only as a negative 
response to change. In the absence of really positive benefits from the proposed change, the 
‘default’ response of resistance is acceptable.
It is unusual for any change not to attract some resistance. Even with foresight, pre-­planning 
and all the apparent logic behind the need to change, you should expect some resist-
ance as the norm. Recognise and welcome it as a healthy response and an opportunity to 
openly debate possibilities and treat resistance as a powerful ally in facilitating the learning 
process.55
Taylor points out that one of the most stressful aspects of change is often the sense of loss 
of control that accompanies it. The individual can feel powerless and helpless. Many organisa-
tions spend a great deal of attention and energy focusing on the operational outcomes of pro-
posed changes but often pay scant attention to enabling employees to adapt psychologically to 
the new situation.56 Reeves and Knell suggest that ‘knowledge leaders understand that change 
provokes an emotional response, that successful change involves allowing people to feel angry, 
resentful and afraid as well as excited, hopeful and energised’.57
Activities managed on the basis of economic or technical efficiency alone are unlikely to 
lead to optimum improvement in organisational performance. One of the most important 
factors in the successful implementation of organisational change is the style of managerial 
behaviour. Some members may actually prefer, and respond better, to a directed and controlled 
style of management. (Recall, for example, the discussion on Theory X and Theory Y styles 
of managerial behaviour in Chapter 10.) In most cases, however, the introduction of change is 
more likely to be effective with a participative style of managerial behaviour. If staff are kept 
fully informed of proposals, are encouraged to adopt a positive attitude and have personal 
involvement in the implementation of the change, there is a greater likelihood of their accept-
ance of the change.
● An important priority is to create an environment of trust and shared commitment, and to 
involve staff in decisions and actions that affect them. It is important that members of staff 
understand fully the reasons for change. Organisations should try to avoid change for the 
sake of change as this can both be disruptive and lead to mistrust. However, considerations 
of the need to change arising from advances in IT simply cannot be ignored. There should 
be full and genuine participation of all staff concerned as early as possible, preferably well 
before the actual introduction of new equipment or systems. Information about proposed 
change, its implications and potential benefits should be communicated clearly to all inter-
ested parties. Staff should be actively encouraged to contribute their own ideas, suggestions 
and experiences, and to voice openly their worries or concerns.
● Team management, a co-operative spirit among staff and a genuine feeling of shared 
involvement will help create a greater willingness to accept change. A participative style of 
managerial behaviour that encourages supportive relationships between managers and sub-
ordinates, and group methods of organisation, decision-making and supervision, are more 
likely to lead to a sustained improvement in work performance. There is an assumption that 
most people will direct and control themselves more willingly if they share in the setting of 
their objectives.
● As part of the pre-planning for new technology there should be a carefully designed ‘human 
resource management action programme’. The action programme should be directed to a 
review of recruitment and selection, natural wastage of staff, potential for training, retrain-
ing and the development of new skills, and other strategies to reduce the possible level of 
redundancies or other harmful effects on staff. There should be full and meaningful con-
sultation with trade unions and staff associations. Where appropriate, arrangements for 
greater flexibility or a shorter working week, and redeployment of staff, should be devel-
oped in full consultation with those concerned.

 the biggest difficulty with change is the associated fear and uncertainty. this is a natural reaction for most peo-
ple. however, a participative style of management with full and open continuous communications throughout the 
change would noticeably minimise problems.

 Getting people to accept change 
 Anne Riches, an internationally recognised leader in neuro-scientifi c research, questions why 
some organisations struggle to change and applies an interesting approach to resistance to 
change based on a neuro-scientifi c understanding. Whether consolidating a merger, reengi-
neering business processes, restructuring, changing value propositions, introducing new IT 
systems, relocating premises or changing the culture – all too often the process is derailed 
by the resistance of employees. Resistance to change is one of the most powerful drivers of 
human behaviour, and the key to dealing with it eff ectively is to understand both its physi-
cal and emotional components. Most organisations make two fatal errors when dealing with 
resistance. Firstly, they underestimate the strength of current patterns that employees are com-
fortable and familiar with. Secondly, they underestimate what will be required to change those 
patterns and deal with the automatic, though sometimes subtle, fi ght or fl ight responses that 
occur when employees interpret changes as threats. 
 The amygdala and The Almond Eﬀ ect ® 
 According to Riches, our brains are hard-wired to do three things: match patterns, resist or fi ght 
any threats to survival and respond fi rst with emotion over logic. Our neural pathways and amyg-
dalae are the key players in these reactions. The amygdala is an almond-shaped piece of the brain 
that triggers the ‘fi ght or fl ight’ reaction. Your brain has two amygdalae, and they play a funda-
mental role in ensuring your survival. Sometimes, though, the amygdalae set off  a false alarm. 
This is what Riches calls The Almond Eff ect ® . Put simply, you act without thinking and get it 
wrong. You can probably think of many times when this has happened, times when you said or 
did something in the heat of the moment and almost immediately afterwards regretted it. 
 At work, The Almond Eff ect often gets in the way. It is the reason why, all too often, human 
beings automatically react to change with resistance, even before they fully understand the 
nature of the change. The amygdala has activated the fear response based on previous memo-
ries of change (old neural pathways) associated with, for example, job losses, more work, new 
skills required, change of roster, cost cutting and so on. Stress hormones are released as part 
of the inbuilt fl ight/fi ght mechanism and show up at work as anger, anxiety, lethargy, poor 
performance and reluctance to change. 
 Mechanisms of change 
 Riches points out that people do not change behaviours easily. This is especially true in work-
places with cultures and histories that are slow and resistant to change. The nature and inten-
sity of our motivation to change will diff er in various circumstances but regardless of our 
reasons for wanting to change behaviours or thought patterns, we will have to create new 
neural pathways and then use them in preference to the old ones. 
 When we have to change, and even if we are strongly motivated to do so, we need to stay 
actively focused on changing our behaviours. If not, you may fi nd yourself in a situation where 

Chapter 15  Organisational culture and change
563
the old behaviours are triggered automatically and reappear. Many managers seem to over-
look this. They become frustrated and impatient with the time it takes for people to adopt 
change at work. They get tired of answering questions like: ‘But what about . . . ?’, ‘What’s 
wrong with the existing way?’ and ‘We’ve tried this before; what makes you think it will work 
this time?’. Many questions are rationally based, yet many more have an emotional basis.
It is worth remembering that:
● Humans are hard-wired for survival above all else.
● Our default thinking is habitual and self-perpetuating.
● Everyone is the product of their own experiences with different motivations and unique memories.
● Change can be frustratingly slow because it is hard brain work to rewire – even if it is logi-
cal and in the best interests.
Managers striving for commitment to change require people to respond to those emotion-
based concerns even though they are under time pressures and deadlines. Failure to address 
the emotionally based questions results in delayed or failed change efforts. These questions are 
triggered by our amygdalae, which are concerned with anything that does not fit the existing 
patterns we know are ‘safe’. Successful change leaders know this.58
Responsibilities of top management
The successful management of change is a key factor of organisational performance and 
effectiveness and should emanate from the top of the organisation. Top management have a 
responsibility for the underlying philosophy and attitudes of the organisation, for creating and 
sustaining a healthy climate and for establishing appropriate and supportive organisational 
processes. The successful implementation of change demands positive action from top man-
agement and a style of transformational leadership in order to gain a commitment to change. 
Yukl points out that, contrary to common assumptions, major changes are not always initiated 
by top management, who may not become involved until the process is well underway. How-
ever, large-scale change is unlikely to be successful without the support of top management.59
Leading IT change
A report published jointly by the CMI, the British Computer Society and the Change Leader-
ship Network refers to challenges facing senior executives to ensure they are better prepared to 
lead technological change. Change always involves risk and on the basis of examination of ten 
detailed organisational case studies the report identifies five key challenges in obtaining best 
value from IT-enabled change:
● Creating transformational value rather than just implementing IT projects.
● Building capability for ongoing change. Being able to predict future business needs and how 
IT can help shape new business models and deliver the desired benefits.
● Creating a climate of open communication.
● Managing confidence and trust – understanding the impact of external changes.
● Building personal capability, learning and confidence.60
Change leaders
An interesting proposition is put forward by Drucker, who contends that ‘one cannot manage 
change. One can only be ahead of it. Everyone now accepts that change is unavoidable.’
But in a period of upheavals, such as the one we are living in, change is the norm. To be sure, 
it is painful and risky, and above all it requires a great deal of very hard work. But unless it 
is seen as the task of the organization to lead change, the organization – whether business, 
university, hospital and so on – will not survive. In a period of rapid structural change, the only 

564
part 4 structure, strategY and eFFectiVeness
ones who survive are the Change Leaders. It is therefore a central 21st-century challenge for 
management that its organization becomes a change leader. A change leader sees change 
as opportunity. A change leader looks for change, knows how to fi nd the right changes and 
knows how to make them eff ective both outside the organization and inside it. This requires: 
  1.  Policies to make the future. 
  2.  Systematic methods to look for and to anticipate change. 
  3.  The right way to introduce change, both within and outside the organization. 
  4.  Policies to balance change and continuity. 61 
 Culture and change 
 Katzenbach et al. suggest that when a major change runs aground, leaders often blame their 
company’s culture for pushing it off  course. Too often culture becomes an excuse and diver-
sion rather than an accelerator and energiser. Leaders see cultural initiatives as a last resort, 
except for top-down exhortations to change. 
 Must cultures are too well entrenched to be jettisoned. The secret is to stop fi ghting your 
culture – and to work with and within it, until it evolves in the right direction. 62  
 Critical review and reﬂ ection 
 an organisation cannot develop, or change. it is the people comprising the organisation who determine the culture 
of the organisation, and who develop and change. the study of organisational culture and change should therefore 
concentrate priority on the actions, behaviour and effectiveness of individuals. 
 What is YOUR considered view? How realistic do YOU believe this contention to be? 
 Ten key points to remember 
  1  a central feature of the successful organisation is the diagnosis of its culture, health and perfor-
mance, and the ability of the organisation to adapt to change. 
  2   culture describes what the organisation is all about and helps to explain its underlying values 
and how things are performed in diff erent organisations. 
  3  culture is a general concept, and diffi  cult to explain precisely. there are a number of ways to 
classify diff erent types of organisational culture. 
  4  the culture of an organisation develops over time and in response to a complex set of factors. 
One view of culture is as a means of organisational control. 
  5  culture has an important eff ect on the behaviour and actions of individuals, on the process of 
management and on organisational performance. 
  6  Organisational climate is based on the perception of members towards the organisation, and is 
the state of mutual trust and understanding among its members. 
  7  Organisations operate within an increasingly volatile environment. change is a pervasive infl u-
ence and an inescapable part of social and organisational life. 
  8  Planned organisational change involves a process of behaviour modifi cation. change is recip-
rocal and changing organisations may aff ect the nature of managerial work.

 Review and discussion questions 
 Assignment  Understanding your organisation’s personality 
 An important part of any manager’s, salesperson’s or front-line staﬀ ’s role is to be an ambassador for the 
organisation. This means representing its values, its image and its style in a variety of situations. 
 In each case, you represent the personality not only of yourself, but of your organisation – and one of the 
most eﬀ ective ways to explore the personality of your organisation is by describing it as if it were a person. 
 Ask yourself the following questions about your organisation: 
 ● 
 What gender would it be? 
 ● 
 How old would it be? 
 ● 
 Where would it live? 
 ● 
 Where would it prefer to holiday? 
 ● 
 What car would it drive? 
 ● 
 What interests or hobbies would it have? 
 ● 
 If it were to win the lottery, what would it do?

 the charity actionaid was created by albert cecil cole, 
a successful entrepreneur, in 1972. it was one of several 
philanthropic organisations (including Oxfam) either 
founded or supported by cole, and in its fi rst incarna-
tion (as action in distress) its aim was to provide direct 
sponsorship of education; initially eighty-eight uK spon-
sors committed to the funding for eighty-eight children 
in india and Kenya. For the fi rst ten years of its history 
it focused on creating similar long-term programmes 
of educational sponsorship in other african and asian 
countries, but also gradually came to include projects 
related to health, sanitation and agricultural improve-
ments in its range of activities. the educational spon-
sorship scheme is still a major part of its work: 60,000 
children were sponsored during 2012, and the donors 
receive annual messages and photographs from their 
sponsored child together with reports from actionaid 
staff  on their progress. 63  nevertheless, the organisation 
has changed considerably in its approach, structure and 
focus as the needs of developing countries themselves

 Objectives 
 completing this exercise should help you to: 
 ●  Work together eff ectively in a small group. 
 ●  evaluate organisational culture and its application to management and organisational behaviour. 
 ●  undertake a critical review of the socialisation process. 
 Exercise 
 the socialisation of new members of staff  into the culture of the organisation is an important aspect of management 
and organisational behaviour. 
 Working in small groups, you are required to undertake a detailed review of the socialisation of new members into 
the culture of your own university (or organisation). comment critically, with supporting examples where possible, 
on the extent to which the socialisation process successfully addresses such topics as, for example: 
 ●  design and nature of the induction programme 
 ●  introduction to top management and key members of staff  
 ●  expected patterns of behaviour 
 ●  unwritten codes of behaviour, including dress codes 
 ●  attempts to build cohesiveness among close working colleagues 
 ●  Mentoring relationships 
 ●  responsibilities for human resource management 
 ●  nature of discipline and grievance procedures 
 ●  social facilities and activities 
 ●  housekeeping arrangements such as canteen and refreshment facilities, car parking 
 ●  Opportunities for further studies, training and development, career progression. 
 Discussion 
 ●  how successfully did the socialisation process indoctrinate new members into the ways of the university or 
organisation and its cultural norms? What changes would you recommend? 
 ●  how much did you learn about the informal organisation or how things really work? 
 ●  to what extent did the socialisation process help generate an initial feeling of engagement with the university or 
organisation?

have changed. Such change is common in business 
organisations, which have to adapt to the market, but 
can be controversial and difficult for charities and other 
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) like ActionAid.
Charity, politics and human rights
The traditional model of organisations such as ActionAid, 
which attempt to address issues of poverty in develop-
ing countries, is a familiar one. It involves appealing to 
people’s sense of altruism as a means of attracting both 
donors and workers. Money or effort is then directed at a 
specific problem, be it a major emergency (such as a flood 
or earthquake) or a more general issue (providing medical 
services, organising building projects, creating clean water 
supplies or shipping equipment and materials to where 
they are needed). The governments of most developed 
countries have also considered it important to contrib-
ute to such problems, and many earmark a percentage 
of national tax revenue for overseas aid. As a result of 
this, the governments of poor and developing countries 
have often found themselves heavily reliant on grants and 
loans from the developed world when trying to improve 
living conditions and reduce poverty. However well inten-
tioned, aid does not necessarily lead to lasting change 
and, at worst, can result in a sort of dependency trap with 
money grants tied to the use of goods and services pro-
vided by the donor country. The traditional model of aid 
as charity and the responsibility of the developed world, 
even when it is effective on the ground, can be seen as 
having some important limitations and drawbacks.
The human rights-based approach (HRBA)64 to issues 
of world poverty sees issues such as access to educa-
tion as part of a wider picture – that of universal human 
rights. This is based on a very different philosophy from 
the familiar charity/aid approach. For example, if free 
basic education is considered as a universal human right 
by the international community (as it is under Article 26 
of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights)65 then any government that fails to provide it is 
technically in breach of international law. NGOs that 
adopt the HRBA to their work believe that this means 
they have a responsibility to pressurise governments in 
the developing world to engage with these failures and 
to correct them. Furthermore, this pressure has to come 
from below. The people whose human rights are being 
breached should both understand that this is the case 
and be encouraged and enabled to campaign on their 
own behalf. Therefore the work of aid organisations has 
to include empowering and facilitating these campaigns, 
not simply providing materials or services.
From welfare to human rights activism
In its original form, ActionAid, like many charities and 
NGOs, adopted the ‘traditional’ model, which focused on 
providing the education that was seen as fundamental to 
enabling poor people to improve their situation. Educa-
tional programmes were organised and delivered locally, 
meaning that ActionAid developed a structure and system 
of governance that is largely decentralised and federalised:
We are a federation. That means that every country 
has an equal share in decisions. The same applies 
to our work on the ground. ActionAid staff are local 
people, and we never impose our own solutions on the 
communities we work with.66
In the late 1990s ActionAid began a significant process 
of change. Firstly, it relocated its headquarters from 
London to Johannesburg and since 2003 it has been 
the only organisation of its kind that is based in a devel-
oping country. This move was one manifestation of a 
major ideological change: the adoption of the HRBA 
to its work. This new approach resulted from changing 
perceptions of how poverty could be alleviated on a 
sustainable basis, and involved a more controversial and 
overtly political attitude to development work.
In 2010 the organisation published a document that 
both consolidated its new philosophy and offered practi-
cal advice to its workers that would help embed a new 
way of working in its organisational culture and activities: 
Action on Rights: Human Rights Based Approach Resource 
Book.67 This text was aimed at staff and was intended to 
offer both guidance and inspiration to programme work-
ers. It gave a clear articulation of the new approach and 
traced its development back to the 1970s, telling three sto-
ries to illustrate three phases of change. The stories, about 
an education programme in Kenya, are summarised in a 
table that could be easily recognised by ActionAid work-
ers, enabling them to understand the cultural change and 
to set it in a familiar context. For example, one extract 
from the table is about ActionAid’s changing role:

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
This represented a significant change: where previously 
the organisation had focussed on providing educational 
services to ‘needy’ populations, it was now focussing on 
helping these populations assert their right to publicly 
funded education.68
The resource book was used as part of a major initia-
tive throughout the organisation to communicate and 
install the HRBA. This programme included training for 
key staff who could then run retreats and national train-
ing programmes for field staff in each country where 
ActionAid was operating. This intense communication 
and development programme was essential to achiev-
ing culture change:
Approaching 
development 
interventions 
as 
an 
instance of human rights work rather than need-based 
charitable work is a monumental shift in thinking and 
requires an overhaul of how staff and partners operate 
in the field. One could not expect such a transition to 
proceed easily or automatically.69
Longer-term support for the new strategy involved 
coaching, quality circles and a staff exchange pro-
gramme. Workers had the opportunity to give feedback, 
which would, in turn, inform the organisation’s strategy 
for the period 2012–17. The strategy, together with a fur-
ther and more detailed resource book, was published in 
2012.70 One of the key purposes of these documents was 
to align the work of a decentralised organisation where 
power did not emanate from the top:
This resource book is designed to be relevant for all 
ActionAid staff and partners. It aims to help staff and 
partners design and implement local, national and 
international rights programmes that are aligned with 
our collectively agreed strategy. It aims to be relevant 
to programme specialists and policy analysts, to 
campaigners and communications staff, to managers 
and trustees, to frontline workers and fundraisers, to 
administrators and activists.71
Despite this effort, there is some evidence that grass-
roots staff were reluctant to abandon a ‘service delivery’ 
approach. Perhaps it is a measure of the organisation’s 
growing confidence in the cultural change that has been 
achieved that ActionAid’s International Education Team 
has felt able to reframe its approach by integrating ser-
vice provision into the HRBA rather than seeing them as 
in opposition to each other.72 Today ActionAid is viewed 
as one of the most progressive and radical NGOs work-
ing in the development sector. As Joanna Kerr, the Chief 
Executive, explains on the organisation’s website:
The work we are doing is truly different because of the way 
we mobilise communities to defend their own rights.73

 given a  forced-choice situation most people would prefer to work for an effective organisation that offers long-term 
job security and consistent high wages rather than an organisation that is more about a happy place to work. 
 What do YOU think about this contention? To what extent is it true for YOU? Do you think YOUR view is likely to 
change over time? 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 every work organisation is concerned with being eff ective. the ultimate 
survival of the organisation depends upon the attainment of its goals 
and objectives. the quality of management and commitment of staff  
to their work are central to the success of the organisation. attention 
needs to be focused on managerial actions and behaviour and factors 
infl uencing levels of organisational performance and eff ectiveness.

  CHAPTER 16 
 Organisational performance and 
development

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
The crucial role of managers
The underlying theme of this book has been the need for organisational effectiveness based on 
an understanding of organisational behaviour, the people resource and the role of manage-
ment as an integrating activity. As mentioned earlier (see Chapter 1), whatever the nature of 
the work organisation it is through the process of management that the efforts of members of 
the organisation are co-ordinated, directed and guided towards the achievement of its goals. 
Management is the cornerstone of organisational effectiveness. Whatever the functions or 
activities within the organisation, there is a close relationship with the actions and behaviour 
of management.
The ‘Quality of Management’ is one of nine measures of success by which Management 
Today rates performance in its annual survey of Britain’s Most Admired Companies. Other 
chapters of this book have emphasised the importance of management as an integrating 
activity that permeates every facet of the operations of the organisation. Recognition of the 
importance of effective management for organisational success is evidenced by the increasing 
attention given to the development of management skills and talent, discussed below.
A major survey undertaken by the Management Consultancies Association (MCA) and 
Management Today draws attention to the changing relationship between organisations and 
individuals. More and more work is outsourced, teams are dispersed across multiple locations, 
an increasing number of people work away from the organisations and greater empowerment 
is shifting responsibility to individuals. This shift of responsibility from the organisation 
to the individual begs the question: ‘Are managers really necessary and what is the role of 
management?’
Ironically, a time when people appear to require less management is also a time when they 
want it more than ever. Half of all respondents to the MCA/MT survey felt their bosses spent 
insufficient time actually managing their staff, a figure that was highest among employees of 
large organisations and in the manufacturing, financial services and the public sector.1
According to Lucas, global competition, particularly from the BRICK countries (Brazil, 
Russia, India, China and Korea), means that companies can no longer compete simply on 
price, and breaking the mould is more important than ever: ‘Organisations need to be more 
creative in their approach to recognising, nurturing and turning innovative ideas into business 
reality – and managers are the key to that process.’ Innovation, however, is not just about 
the big ground-breaking ideas of technological advances; it is often about small incremental 
changes to products, services or processes. Lucas reports on the crucial role of managers as 
the single most important factor in the success of innovation initiatives. This requires a leader 
and team with the ability and passion to turn ideas into business reality. Managers need to: 
provide focus for their teams; generate the energy to make change happen; be good at coping 
with ambiguity and uncertainty; create a culture where people feel safe to experiment; and be 
willing to give agenda time to innovation.2
Management practices and productivity
According to a report from the Advanced Institute of Management Research (AIM) and 
CMI, management practices are central to an understanding of the UK’s competitive perfor-
mance. Evidence from recent UK experiences is that productivity and performance are more 
influenced by what happens inside organisations than the economic and regulatory environ-
ments in which they operate. Productivity is linked closely to the adoption and utilisation of 
new management practices. Yet efforts to translate new management practices into improved 
performance are slower and less successful than some counterparts in France, Germany and 
the USA.
The report suggests that too easily commentators and consultants assume that a ‘copycat 
strategy’ will work. However, organisations need to do more than slavishly follow the latest 

Chapter 16  Organisational performance and development
573
‘big idea’. They need to adapt good practices to their own environment. But for true competi-
tive advantage, organisations need to develop ‘signature processes’ that are difficult for rivals 
to replicate. Managers need to be alert and open to both developments in the wider world 
and the strengths and weaknesses of their own situation as they debate which practices might 
improve their competitiveness and how they might adopt them.3
Attributes and qualities of a manager
Whatever the role of the manager, or whether in the private or public sector, in order to carry 
out the process of management and the execution of work the manager requires a combina-
tion of technical competence, social and human skills and conceptual ability.4
As the manager advances through the organisational hierarchy, greater emphasis is likely 
to be placed on conceptual ability and proportionately less on technical competence (see Fig-
ure 16.1). (See also the discussion on levels of organisation in Chapter 11.)
● Technical competence relates to the application of specific knowledge, methods and skills 
to discrete tasks. Technical competence is likely to be required more at the supervisory level 
and for the training of subordinate staff, and with day-to-day operations concerned in the 
actual production of goods or services.
● Social and human skills refer to interpersonal relationships in working with and through 
other people, and the exercise of judgement. A distinctive feature of management is the 
ability to secure the effective use of the human resources of the organisation. This involves 
effective teamwork and the direction and leadership of staff to achieve co-ordinated effort. 
Under this heading can be included sensitivity to particular situations and flexibility in 
adopting the most appropriate style of management.
● Conceptual ability is required in order to view the complexities of the operations of the 
organisation as a whole, including environmental influences. It also involves decision-mak-
ing skills. The manager’s personal contribution should be related to the overall objectives 
of the organisation and to its strategic planning.
Although a simplistic approach, this framework provides a useful basis from which to exam-
ine the combination and balance of the attributes of an effective manager. For example, the 
extent of technical competence or conceptual ability will vary according to the nature of the 
organisation and the level at which the manager is working. However, major technological 
change means that managers at all levels of the organisation increasingly require technical 
competence in the skills of information communications technology.

 The importance of management skills 
 In recent years, increasing attention has been given by the government to the importance of 
the supply and application of skills attainment. The UK Commission for Employment and 
Skills (UKCES) aims to raise UK prosperity and opportunity by improving employment and 
skills levels across the UK, benefi tting individuals, employers, government and society. UKCES 
is leading major research into skills utilisation and the Treasury commissioned the Leitch 
Review of Skills, which reported in December 2006, to assess the required skills profi le for 
the UK to achieve by 2020. The report recognises: that good management is a prerequisite to 
improving business performance; the high levels of demand for management skills; and the 
growing evidence base demonstrating the strong links between the impact of management 
skills and increased national competitiveness. 5 
 Developing management skills for the future 
 A major study (‘Management Futures’) by the CMI, including a survey of 1,000 senior exec-
utives, has investigated how the world of work and management will look in 2018: ‘The 
increased monitoring and surveillance of work on all levels will require organisations to ensure 
that they have many of the management skills such as interpersonal skills, building alliances, 
strategic planning and political skills that are needed in business today.’ 
 The CMI foresees that the tasks of people within organisations will have a new focus. An 
increasingly fl exible and transient workforce, and multicultural and remote teamworking, will 
require talented and prudent managers who excel in analysis, evaluation and, above all, good 
judgement. 
 Among the key fi ndings are that: 
  The working population will be more diverse. Changing expectations of work and the impact 
of new technologies will require managers and leaders to develop a range of skills that focus 
on emotional and spiritual intelligence, judgement and the ability to stimulate creative think-
ing to improve productivity. 
 Among the recommendations to leaders and managers are the need to focus on individual 
employees and their needs when developing new technologies, to make organisations more 
human and to motivate people creatively. 
 A greater degree of emotional intelligence will be required by managers so that they can 
understand how people work and their likely reactions to change. They will also benefi t from 
having the humility to accept that they are not always the ones with the best or most appropri-
ate ideas. 6 (Emotional intelligence is discussed in  Chapter  4 .) 
 Developing infl uencing skills 
 According to  Mann,  few would argue that an integral role of management involves infl uenc-
ing people, especially in engaging and motivating employees without resorting to coercion, 
threats or manipulation. Infl uencing skills are wide ranging and overlap more general spheres 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 technical competence can easily be learned and not all managers require conceptual ability, but someone with poor 
social and human skills can never become an effective manager. these attributes are part of a person’s personality 
and you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.

of interpersonal and communication skills, assertiveness and self-presentation. Mann sug-
gests key strategies that contribute to how well one can exert positive infl uence: 
 ●  Listening skills – As opposed to the use of authority, to really win hearts and minds you 
need to listen to the ideas, thoughts and complaints of staff . 
 ●  Empowering skills – Rather than telling staff  what to do, empower them to develop their 
own strategies and skill base. 
 ●  Respect – Show respect to staff  by considering their views and wishes, understanding their 
concerns and being sympathetic to issues in their private life. 
 ●  Self-confi dence – Belief in your own abilities and strengths allows you to give people credit, 
accept responsibility for mistakes where appropriate and be decisive. 
 ●  Nurturing skills – Nurture your team’s talent by awareness of individual skills and abilities, 
encouraging development and building on existing skill level. 
 Engaging managers use their spheres of infl uence to demonstrate appreciation of their team’s 
eff orts, listen to its opinions and ensure it feels supported. 7 
 Growing emphasis on ‘soft’ skills 
 Management has become as much, if not more, about managing people than managing 
operations. Social and human skills that refl ect the ability to get along with other people 
are increasingly important attributes at all levels of management. According to  Saunders, 
the nature of management is changing and soft skills are on the rise. The stock of managers 
with the sharpest social and psychological skills is also on the rise because of today’s lean, 
fl at organisational structures. Octavius Black, CEO of MindGym, draws attention to the 
emotional side of work and claims that a degree in psychology would be a better training 
ground for managers. 
  We have done competitive advantage from strategy and from technology. What’s left is com-
petitive advantage from your people and the line manager is crucial to that. Get your people 
to fl ourish and your organisation will perform better. 8

 Octavius Black, as above, draws attention to the emotional side of work and claims that a degree in psychology 
would be a better training ground for managers. 
 What do YOU think? How well is YOUR course of study preparing YOU for a managerial role? How would YOU assess 
YOUR potential managerial skills? 
 Managerial eff ectiveness 
 The overall responsibility of management can be seen as the successful attainment of the given 
objectives of the organisation, upon which rests the ultimate survival of the organisation. 
There is therefore a clear and important need for eff ective management. And this need is just 
as strong in public-sector and voluntary organisations as in private-enterprise organisations. 
Indeed, it could be argued that in local government, for example, the accountability of public 
servants to elected members for their actions means that professional standards of manage-
ment of the highest order are even more essential. 
 The importance of managerial performance and eff ectiveness has long been recognised by 
major writers such as  Drucker who, originally in 1955, propounded that: 
 The manager is the dynamic, life-giving element in every business. Without their leadership 
‘the resources of production’ remain resources and never become production. In a competitive 

576
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
economy, above all, the quality and performance of the managers determine the success of a 
business; indeed they determine its survival. For the quality and performance of its managers 
is the only effective advantage an enterprise in a competitive economy can have.9
Efficiency and effectiveness
Managerial efficiency can be distinguished from managerial effectiveness. Efficiency is con-
cerned with ‘doing things right’ and relates to inputs and what the manager does. Effectiveness 
is concerned with ‘doing the right things’ and relates to outputs of the job and what the man-
ager actually achieves. To be efficient the manager must attend therefore to the input require-
ments of the job – to clarification of objectives, planning, organisation, direction and control. 
But in order to be effective, the manager must give attention to the outputs of the job – to 
performance in terms of such factors as obtaining best possible results in the important areas 
of the organisation, optimising use of resources, increasing profitability and attainment of the 
aims and objectives of the organisation.
Effectiveness must be related to the achievement of some purpose, objective or task – to the 
performance of the process of management and the execution of work. Criteria for assessing 
the effectiveness of a manager should be considered in terms of measuring the results that the 
manager is intended to achieve. But what is also important is the manner in which the man-
ager achieves results and the effects on other people. This may well influence effectiveness in 
the longer term. Managerial effectiveness results from a combination of personal attributes 
and dimensions of the manager’s job in meeting the demands of the situation, and satisfying 
the requirements of the organisation.
Measures of effectiveness
Management involves getting work done through the co-ordinated efforts of other people. 
Managers are most likely to be judged not just on their own performance, but also on the 
results achieved by other staff.
Managers are successful if they create conditions for others to succeed.
Ann Francke, Chief Executive CMI, Professional Manager, September/October 2012, p. 5
The manager’s effectiveness may be assessed in part, therefore, by such factors as:
● the strength of motivation and morale of staff;
● the success of their training and development; and
● the creation of an organisational environment in which staff work willingly and effectively.
The difficulty is determining objective measurement of such factors. Some possible indication 
might be given by, for example:
● the level of staff retention;
● the incidence of sickness;
● absenteeism;
● poor timekeeping; and
● accidents at work.
However, such figures are likely to be influenced also by broader organisational or environ-
mental considerations, for example poor job security due to the economic climate, which are 
outside the direct control of the individual manager. In any case, there is the general question 
of the extent to which such figures bear a direct relationship to the actual performance of 
subordinate staff.

Chapter 16  Organisational performance and development
577
Other criteria of effectiveness
For some management jobs it might be possible to identify more quantitative factors that may 
give an indication of managerial effectiveness, including:
● meeting important deadlines;
● accuracy of work carried out by the department, perhaps measured by the number of 
recorded errors;
● level of complaints received from superiors, other departments, customers or clients, sup-
pliers, the public;
● adherence to quality standards, for example the amount of scrap or waste material;
● keeping within agreed cost or budgetary control limits; and
● levels of output and productivity (see Figure 16.2).
Another broad, qualitative criterion of increasing significance today is in terms of perceived 
social accountability and the ethical behaviour of individual managers and the organisation as 
a whole (discussed in Chapter 14).
Composite list of basic qualities
Mintzberg refers to the many lists of the qualities of effective managers. These lists are usu-
ally short and incomplete as they do not include important aspects such as native intelligence, 
being a good listener or just having energy. For the ‘sake of a better world’ Mintzberg provides 
a composite list of fifty-two qualities (Figure 16.3): ‘Be all fifty-two and you are bound to be 
an effective manager, if not a human one.’ Mintzberg refers also to the romance of leadership 
that on the one hand puts ordinary mortals on managerial pedestals and on the other hand 
figure 16.2  Possible indicators of managerial effectiveness

578
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
allows us to vilify them as they come crashing down: ‘Yet some mangers do stay up, if not on 
that silly pedestal. How so?’
The answer is simple: ‘successful managers are flawed – we are all flawed – but their par-
ticular flaws are not fatal, at least under the circumstances.’10
The 3-D model of managerial behaviour
However effectiveness is measured, managers are likely to be effective only if they adopt the 
most appropriate style of behaviour. A development of the Blake and Mouton Managerial 
Grid, discussed earlier (Chapter  10), is the three-dimensional (3-D) model of managerial 
behaviour suggested by Reddin. By adding a third dimension of managerial effectiveness to 
task orientation and relationship orientation, the 3-D model identifies eight possible styles of 
managerial behaviour:11
● Task orientation (TO) is the extent to which the manager directs both personal and subor-
dinates’ efforts through planning, organisation and control.
● Relationship orientation (RO) is dependent upon the manager’s personal job relation-
ships. This is characterised by consideration for subordinates’ feelings, mutual trust and 
encouragement.

Chapter 16  Organisational performance and development
579
The combination of TO and RO determines the manager’s basic style of behaviour. The four 
possible basic styles (see Figure 16.4) are similar to those identified by Blake and Mouton in 
the Managerial Grid.
Apparent and personal effectiveness
Each of these four basic styles of management can be effective or ineffective depending on the 
situation in which they are applied. Effectiveness is defined by Reddin as:
the extent to which a manager achieves the output requirements of his position . . . Manage-
rial effectiveness has to be defined in terms of output rather than input, by what a manager 
achieves rather than by what he does.
Reddin distinguishes managerial effectiveness from (i) apparent effectiveness and (ii) per-
sonal effectiveness:
● Apparent effectiveness is the extent to which the behaviour of the manager – for exam-
ple, punctuality, giving prompt answers, tidiness, making quick decisions and good public 
­relations – gives the appearance of effectiveness. Such qualities may or may not be relevant 
to effectiveness.
● Personal effectiveness is the extent to which the manager achieves personal objectives – for 
example, power and prestige – rather than the objectives of the organisation.
Applying the third dimension of managerial effectiveness provides eight styles of manage-
rial behaviour – four effective styles, which achieve output requirements, and four ineffective 
styles. For each of the basic styles – separated, dedicated, related or integrated – there is a 
more effective or less effective version. Effectiveness results from the appropriateness of a par-
ticular style of management to the demands of the situation in which it is applied.
Birkinshaw questions how one can become a better boss. Employees are looking for challenging 
work, space, support and recognition. But why do managers not do what they know they should? 
The busier you are, the more likely it is you will get into bad management: ‘Lack of time and 
resources are only part of the story. The underlying problem is that many aspects of good manage-
ment involve going against our natural instincts.’ The hallmarks of a good manager include: 
● the capacity to let go and to give power and freedom to others and allow others to make 
mistakes;
● giving credit to others and downplaying your own achievements – own your failures and 
share your successes;
● exercising self-control and the ability to regulate your own emotions and instincts. Be more 
attentive to your own shortcomings.12

is the eff ective use of time. With many managers who complain that they do not have suffi  -
cient time it may be more that they have failed to organise themselves or their work properly. 
Although currently a popular topic of attention, the importance of time management has 
long been recognised as an inherent feature of management.  Drucker, writing in 1988, refers to 
time as the limiting factor for eff ective executives. Time is a unique resource – you cannot rent, 
hire, buy or otherwise obtain more time. The supply of time is totally inelastic; time is totally 
irreplaceable and everything requires time. 13 
 According to the CMI, eff ective time management is simply making the best use of limited 
time towards achieving the best desirable goals. 
 Eff ective time management can help you to gain more control over your activities, increase 
your effi  ciency, improve your work/life balance and become proactive rather than reactive 
in preventing or dealing with problems. Getting to grips with time management should help 
to reduce work pressures so that you will feel more relaxed, and others will be more likely to 
perceive you as calm and well-organised. 
 The checklist also refers to overwork as counterproductive, causing stress and a decrease in 
time effi  ciency. It is important to devote an adequate proportion of time to yourself and make 
time to play. 14 
 Dryburgh suggests that, despite numerous courses, for many time management will remain 
a huge problem: ‘There’s a strange and slightly disturbing paradox about the time manage-
ment industry – it is as big as it is because it doesn’t work.’ 
 Time management doesn’t work because it assumes we are rational creatures when it comes 
to allocating our time. It assumes that we can work out, perfectly rationally, those things 
which are both urgent and important, and then concentrate our eff orts there. The problem 
is that we are not rational. We avoid that which makes us uncomfortable (these tend to be 
the important things). We feel reluctant to do things diff erently, even when it is obvious to 
our rational selves that the old ways don’t make sense any more. We fi nd it hard to say ‘no’ 
to pointless requests. 15  
 Eff ectiveness and activity 
 For many managers, appearing always to be busy, a cluttered desk and a continual fl urry of 
activity are outward signs of their eff ectiveness. The trouble is that such managers may be too 
busy ‘doing’ rather than  thinking about what they, and their staff , should be doing and how 
they should be doing it. Activity may be a substitute for actual achievement. It is important 
therefore to distinguish eff ectiveness from activity.  Rees and Porter suggest that: 
 Activity-centred behaviour is in any case much more likely to spring from incompetence and/
or insecurity rather than adroit political behaviour. Activity-centred behaviour is likely to 
aggravate the position of the manager in the long run rather than ameliorate it. 16 
 Critical review and refl ection 
 the philosophy and actions of successful managers should include acknowledgement of  mea culpa, the admission 
of responsibility for their failings and a clear open apology for their mistakes. 
 Do YOU agree such behaviour would help improve the general quality and perception of management? To what 
extent are YOU able to accept openly responsibility for YOUR failings? 

Chapter 16  Organisational performance and development
581
A similar point is made by Hoyle and Newman, who refer to the many people who are satis-
fied being busy but in their diligence and attention to detail mistake activity for achievement. 
Rather than the volume of work undertaken it is what work creates that is important. Atten-
tion should be focused on what is achieved and the end result.17
Managers’ checklist
There are numerous popular time management techniques,18 but still one of the most relevant 
approaches is that by Stewart who suggests that it is often salutary for managers to compare 
what they think they do against what happens in practice. Answers to the following questions 
will help managers decide what, if anything, they should check, and to review their effective 
management of time:19
	1.	 Am I giving adequate attention to current activities, to reviewing the past and to planning 
for the future? In particular, am I giving enough thought to the future?
	2.	 Am I dividing my time correctly between different aspects of my job? Is there, perhaps, one 
part of my job on which I spend too much of my time?
	3.	 Have I changed what I am trying to do and how I work to allow for the effects of changes 
in my work?
	4.	 Am I doing work that I ought to have delegated?
	5.	 Who are the people that I ought to be seeing? Am I spending too much or too little time 
with any of them?
	6.	 Do I organise my working day and week, as far as possible, according to priorities, or do I 
tend to deal with each problem as it turns up, or even as I think of it, without stopping to 
think whether there is something more important that I should be working on?
	7.	 Am I able to complete a task, or am I constantly interrupted? If the latter, are all these 
interruptions an essential part of my work?
There are three questions that managers should ask of each of their activities:
● Should it be done at all?
● If so, when should it be done?
● Should it be delegated? (Delegation is discussed in Chapter 13.)
The nature of organisational effectiveness
The underlying theme of this book has been the need for organisational effectiveness based on 
an understanding of organisational behaviour, the people resource and the role of manage-
ment as an integrating activity. Organisational effectiveness, however, is affected by a multi-
plicity of variables. For example, Handy identifies over sixty factors that impinge on any one 
organisational situation and that illustrate the complicated nature of the study of organisa-
tional effectiveness (see Figure 16.5).20
The democratic enterprise
According to Gratton, we have become accustomed to how contemporary organisations are 
structured, managed and run, but many more possibilities exist. Many people feel discon-
nected from their organisation and at times feel they have been treated unfairly and unjustly. 
Gratton refers to the ‘democratic enterprise’, that is organisations that are inspiring and 
meaningful, with the possibility for the individual and the organisation to create a win–win 
relationship and both benefiting but not at the expense of the other.
We are witnessing the emergence of a new way of looking at people and their role in organi-
zations . . . More than at any other point in time, there is now a chance to create the Demo-
cratic Enterprise. Over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that through the forces 

582
Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
of globalization, competition and more demanding customers, the structure of many compa-
nies has become flatter, less hierarchical, more fluid and virtual. The breakdown of hierarchies 
provides us with fertile ground on which to create a more democratic way of working.21
The learning organisation
A key factor in organisational effectiveness is the successful management of change, innova-
tion and corporate renewal. Traditional views of managerial behaviour have placed emphasis 
on planning, organising, directing and controlling. However, increasing international compet-
itiveness and the need for organisations to respond rapidly to constant change in their environ-
ment have drawn renewed attention in recent years to the concept of the learning organisation. 
It is associated with the concept of lifelong learning (discussed in Chapter  5). A central 
theme of the learning organisation is that rapid learning is an essential ingredient of organi-
sational performance and effectiveness. It is therefore often associated with organisational

development. The original idea has been around for many years, however, and was popular-
ised in the 1960s–1980s by major writers such as Argyris.22
At its most basic, organisational learning can be seen in this sense:
in essence the aim is to create a culture for the continuous learning for all employees.23
Another significant contribution has been made by Senge, who defines the learning organisa-
tion as a place:
Where people continually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where 
new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, 
and where people are continually learning how to learn together.24
Characteristics of the learning organisation
Senge maintains that organisations need to develop a culture of learning, and to instil ‘peo-
ple’s commitment and capacity to learn at all levels in an organisation’. Senge suggests that 
there are five basic features of a learning organisation:
● systems thinking – the recognition that things are interconnected and organisations are 
complex systems;
● personal mastery – the competencies and skills associated with management including 
spiritual growth;
● mental models – the driving and fundamental values and principles of the organisation;
● shared vision – the importance of co-operation and a shared vision by team members;
● team learning – the two mutually complementary practices of dialogue and discussion, first 
separating them and then combining them.
Garratt views learning organisations as essentially liberating and energising and as crucial for 
organisational survival and growth. He refers to four characteristics of the learning organisation:
● It encourages people at all levels of the organisation to learn regularly and rigorously from 
their work.
● It has systems for capturing and learning information and moving it where it is needed.
● It values its learning.
● It is able to transform itself continuously.25
Lane et al. emphasise that training in the organisation’s ICT skills is essential for corporate survival 
and should be part of a continuous learning culture. The learning organisation model will create a 
solid foundation on which continually to build. Lane et al. suggest that there is no accepted defini-
tion of the term ‘learning organisation’ but list some key attributes of this type of organisation:
● Learning organisations understand that teams are the fundamental learning unit – not 
individuals.
● Learning organisations develop a shared vision through which a singular purpose is estab-
lished and learning is based on this purpose.
● Learning organisations place learning in the mainstream of their operations. Learning, 
quality and customers are all so important that they are everyone’s job.
● A learning organisation has a culture that embraces questioning and change.
● Learning takes place in anticipation of change rather than just responding tactically to 
problems.
● In a learning organisation technology serves the workforce, not vice versa.
● Learning is intentional and focused on the strategy of the organisation, not reactive.
● Learning organisations structure their processes and systems so that learning and teaching 
are included in the day-to-day work role; consequently, learning is pervasive and change 
created from it is permanent.26

 Concerns about implementation 
 Despite the apparent advantages that can fl ow from a learning organisation, there are concerns 
about its implementation and eff ectiveness, including questions about policies and procedures, 
necessary changes in behaviour and forms of assessment. It is also important to remember 
that learning starts with the individual and the impact of personality, ability and culture on 
the process of learning.  (Recall the discussion in  Chapter  5 .) 
 Coopey believes that there are serious gaps in the learning organisation literature. He 
claims that writers have ignored the importance of control and political activity within organ-
isations. He criticises the unitary view that is taken and the elitist model that is put forward. 
He points to research that shows that, in turbulence, political action increases, and concludes 
that the learning organisation may be destined to be a mechanism of management control, 
which  will ‘advantage some, but disadvantage others’. The eff ect of diff erential power, he 
believes, diminishes the potential for individual and collective learning. 27  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 Organisations have no separate identity of their own and do not exist without their members. the idea of a system-
atic, hierarchical and structured organisational learning approach is contrary to the instinctive individual process of 
learning. 
 To what extent do YOU believe that organisations, not just individuals, are capable of learning? Do YOU associate 
YOUR university with the concept of lifelong learning? 
 Total quality management 
 One particular approach to improved organisational performance and eff ectiveness is the con-
cept of the Japanese-inspired  total quality management (TQM). There are numerous defi ni-
tions of TQM. These are generally expressed in terms of  a way of life for an organisation as 
a whole, committed to total customer satisfaction through a continuous process of improve-
ment, and the contribution and involvement of people. 
 A major infl uence on the establishment and development of TQM was the work of  Dem-
ing, who emphasised the importance of visionary leadership and the responsibility of top 
management for initiating change. Deming drew attention to the importance of pride in 
work and process control, and made constant reference to the importance of ‘good man-
agement’, including the human side of quality improvement and how employees should be 
treated. 28  
 The successful organisation should as a matter of policy be constantly seeking oppor-
tunities to improve the quality of its products and/or services and processes. The organisa-
tion must also couple quality with a required level of productivity. According to the CMI, 
TQM is: 
  a style of managing which gives everyone in the organisation responsibility for delivering 
quality to the fi nal customer; quality being described as ‘fi tness for purpose’ or as ‘delighting 
the customer’. TQM views each task in the organisation as fundamentally a process which is 
in a customer/supplier relationship with the next process. The aim at each stage is to defi ne 
and meet the customer’s requirements in order to maximise the satisfaction of the fi nal con-
sumer at the lowest possible cost. 
 To be successful, the introduction of a TQM strategy involves the whole organisation in a 
major change with considerable research and planning, and a way of life that combines both 
the hard edge of quality with the soft side of cultural change. 29 

Chapter 16  Organisational performance and development
585
Implementation
If TQM is to be implemented successfully it must be seen as a total process involving all 
operations of the organisation and the active participation of top management. It demands 
a supportive organisational culture and a programme of planned management change. TQM 
places emphasis on the involvement of people as the key to improved quality. It involves 
changes to the traditional structure with greater emphasis on natural work groups, multidisci-
plinary working and team-based management. Attention must be given to effective education 
and training, empowerment and the motivation to take ownership of quality, and systems of 
communications at all levels of the organisation. A related successor to TQM is the balanced 
scorecard, discussed below.
Kaizen
An integral part of a total quality approach is the Japanese concept of kaizen, which means 
‘improvement’, or is often interpreted as gradual progress of incremental change. In the work 
situation, kaizen was introduced in several Japanese organisations after the Second World 
War and is particularly associated with Toyota. It is not a methodology for large-scale change 
or the introduction of new processes, but focuses on the people aspect of improvement and 
the acceptance of change. The concept is based on a daily activity of continual evolutionary 
change, the elimination of waste and the belief that the individual workers know more about 
their own jobs than anyone else. Kaizen is a culture of continuous improvement as a way of 
life, involving the whole organisation and all its activities, and all members of staff from top 
managers to junior employees.
Cane suggests that the traditional kaizen approach embeds it in a hierarchical structure, 
although it gives considerable responsibility to employees within certain fixed boundaries. 
The approach:
● analyses every part of a process down to the smallest detail;
● sees how every part of the process can be improved;
● looks at how employees’ actions, equipment and materials can be improved; and
● looks at ways of saving time and reducing waste.30
According to the Kaizen Institute, kaizen is the practice of continuous improvement based 
on guiding principles of: good processes bring good results; go see for yourself to grasp the 
current situation; speak with data, manage by facts; take action to contain and correct root 
causes of problems; work as a team; kaizen is everybody’s business; and much more!31
The balanced scorecard
The balanced scorecard (BS) is an attempt to combine a range of both qualitative and quan-
titative indicators of performance, which recognise the expectations of various stakeholders 
and relates performance to a choice of strategy as a basis for evaluating organisational effec-
tiveness. Citing the work of Kaplan and Norton in a year-long study of a dozen US compa-
nies,32 van de Vliet suggests that in the information era, there is a growing consensus that 
financial indicators on their own are not an adequate measure of company competitiveness or 
performance and there is a need to promote a broader view.
The balanced scorecard does still include the hard financial indicators, but it balances these 
with other, so-called soft measures, such as customer acquisition, retention, profitability and 
satisfaction; product development cycle times; employee satisfaction; intellectual assets and 
organisational learning.33
Bourne and Bourne suggest most people think about the balanced scorecard in terms of 
key performance indicators (KPIs) and target-setting, but it is about aligning actions to 

586
part 4 strUctUre, strategY and effectiveness
strategy and showing people what is important. A well-constructed scorecard tells every-
one in the organisation where it is going and what they are trying to achieve. It clarifi es 
objectives and communicates them widely. 34 According to  Manager  magazine, the balanced 
scorecard has become well established as a system that draws data across multiple func-
tions to produce as full a picture of organisational performance as possible. Referring to 
Kaplan and Norton, in order to reach a more balanced view of overall business perfor-
mance, attention must also be given not only to fi nancial measures, but also to ongoing 
investments in areas such as organisational capacity, customer/stakeholder objectives and 
internal processes. 35   
 Critical review and refl ection 
 effective organisational performance is about quality of managers, inspired leadership and motivated staff. concepts 
such as total quality management and balanced scorecard are just passing fads that offer little real long-term value.

  Employee engagement and commitment 
 It is often said that people join organisations but leave their bosses. Among the factors that 
contribute to a healthy organisational climate is the extent to which members of staff  have a 
sense of engagement with, and commitment to, their work, their managers and to the organi-
sation. Genuine commitment requires not just a recognition or understanding of what the 
organisation expects, but an emotional and behavioural response from staff . The extent of 
their commitment will have a major infl uence on staff  retention and level of work perfor-
mance. For example,  O’Reilly refers to the term ‘organisational commitment’ as ‘typically 
conceived of as an individual’s psychological bond to the organization, including a sense of 
job involvement, loyalty, and a belief in the values of the organization’. 36 
 There are a number of underlying infl uences on the extent of employees’ commitment to 
the organisation: 
 ●  People diff er in their work ethic and the manner of their involvement with, and concern for, 
work and the extent to which they have an instrumental, bureaucratic or solidaristic orien-
tation. Some people may well have a set attitude to work, whatever the nature of the work 
environment  (see  Chapter  1 ). 
 ●  People’s behaviour and the level of their commitment are also infl uenced by the nature of 
the psychological contract and the degree to which it is perceived as fair by both the indi-
vidual and the organisation. 
 ●  In terms of their relationship with the work organisation, employees may reasonably have 
the approach of ‘what’s in it for me?’. An important infl uence on the strength of commit-
ment is the nature of the reward system and the satisfaction of needs and expectations 
at work in terms of economic rewards, intrinsic satisfaction or social relationships  (see 
 Chapter  7 ). 
 Importance of employee engagement 
 The CMI points out that interest in the concept of employee engagement has been growing in 
recent years, reinforced by pressures of economic recession. 

Chapter 16  Organisational performance and development
587
For the organisation employee engagement can be a valuable resource of competitive advan-
tage. It can improve performance, release innovation and creativity, lead to higher levels of 
customer service, facilitate the management of change, increase staff retention levels and 
boost interest in training and development. For the individual, engagement provides a sense 
of satisfaction in work, a feeling of belonging and the opportunity to develop and use per-
sonal skills and abilities to make a contribution that is valued and appreciated.37
The importance of employee commitment and engagement for business success, and the 
importance of people, have been highlighted in a report to the government by Macleod and 
Clarke:38 
Business organisations function best when they make their employees’ commitment, potential, creativity and capa-
bility central to their operation. Clearly having enough cash, and a sensible strategy, are vital. But how people behave 
at work can make the crucial difference between business and operational success or failure.
Employee engagement strategies enable people to be the best they can at work, recognising that this can only 
happen if they feel respected, involved, heard, well led and valued by those they work for and with.
Engaged employees have a sense of personal attachment to their work and organisation; they are motivated and 
able to give of their best to help it succeed – and from that flows a series of tangible benefits for organisation and 
individual alike.
Although improved performance and productivity is at the heart of engagement, it cannot be achieved by a mech-
anistic approach which tries to extract discretionary effort by manipulating employees’ commitment and emotions. 
Employees see through such attempts very quickly; they lead instead to cynicism and disillusionment. By contrast, 
engaged employees freely and willingly give discretionary effort, not as an ‘add on’, but as an integral part of their 
daily activity at work.
Extracts from Macleod, D and Clarke, N. ‘Engaging for Success: Enhancing performance through employee engage-
ment’, A report to Government, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (2009).
Circle of employee engagement
De Vita maintains that employee engagement should not be written off as just another HR 
fad, but neither should it be viewed as a quick fix. Engagement relates to the core of a busi-
ness – its values, culture and way of managing – and changing that is a tall order. But a truly 
engaged company is likely to be a ‘great’ one. As an example De Vita quotes the success of the 
John Lewis Partnership as a result of its co-ownership by employees combined with a collec-
tive management approach and the full engagement of employees.39 The positive behaviour of 
a deeply engaged employee will rub off on clients, customers and colleagues. A highly engaged 
company is known to perform better, enjoy high staff retention, sustain long-term success, 
display energy, productivity and innovativeness and win regard as an attractive place to work. 
See Figure 16.6.
Engagement and the people factor
ACAS draws attention to people as the organisation’s most important asset and describes 
employee engagement as the positive attitude or behaviour of someone at work. As well as being 
very valuable in their own right – in terms of performance, skills and creativity – ­individual 
employees bind every other aspect of working life together. The people factor is about:
● Creating a vision, or story, that everyone feels part of.
● Understanding what motivates and engages employees – is it pay, flexibility or having a say?
● Giving employees a voice – in one-to-one dialogue, team meetings and via employee repre-
sentatives or trade unions.

Investors in People point out that creating purpose in a fast changing environment whilst moti-
vating through change have become essential skills for many roles. Outperforming organisa-
tions foster leadership skills at every level of the organisation to deliver outstanding results. 
The IIP Standard explores practices and outcomes within an organisation under three perfor-
mance headings:
● Leading: creating purpose in a fast changing environment whilst motivating through change 
have become essential skills for many roles. Outperforming organisations foster leadership 
skills at every level of the organisation to deliver outstanding results.
● Supporting: for many, constant change is now normal. Successful organisations are mov-
ing towards flatter structures to enable faster decision-making, customer focus and agility. 
Reducing overheads, better service for customers and more successful organisations are the 
benefits of this approach.
● Improving: the best organisations are always looking for opportunities to improve by seek-
ing every marginal gain. They know that every small change adds together to enable them 
to constantly outperform.
Under each performance heading there are three key indicators. The nine indicators are set out 
in the wheel diagram, Figure 16.8.

The IIP Bronze, Silver and Gold levels highlight an organisation’s standard of people man-
agement quality and help create a competitive edge in its ability to deliver a service and also as 
an employer of choice.
The framework was developed in collaboration with leading UK businesses and govern-
ment to raise the standards of leadership and management. It is internationally recognised 
as a leading quality standard for people management and has proven to support businesses 
through times of change and economic uncertainty using recognised best practice. 
The EFQM Excellence Model
Excellence is the goal for many organisations. EFQM (European Foundation for Quality 
Management) is a global not-for-profit organisation, based in Brussels. The EFQM Excel-
lence Model is a business model that builds on the experience of previous models and is now 
adopted by organisations across the globe to strive for sustainable excellence.
The EFQM Excellence Model is a management framework used by over 30,000 organisations 
in Europe and beyond. The ‘Model’ takes a holistic view to enable organisations, regardless of 
size or sector, to assess where they are, help understand their key strengths and potential gaps

half of them work at the company’s manufacturing plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. The future was looking bleak 
for Ellesmere Port. With Vauxhall’s US owner General Motors losing money, there was a real risk the plant would 
close. But when GM needed to choose a plant to lead production of the new Astra, a lifeline emerged – as long as a 
new working agreement could be reached. Strongly focused on the ‘people’ end of the business, Managing Director 
Duncan Aldred sees IIP as a critical factor in Vauxhall’s journey.
How has IIP helped?
Producing the Astra would require round-the-clock production, meaning big changes to working arrangements. 
Workers, unions and management had to co-operate to win the bid, listening to all voices to devise a mutually 
agreeable plan. It worked: 94 per cent of workers voted for a new four-year pay and conditions deal and the con-
tract was secured. The senior leadership team applied IIP best practice to guide changes throughout the process 
and beyond. The framework was used to support development of key performance indicators, social responsibility 
strategy, succession planning and benchmarking. Today, Vauxhall UK has achieved the Standard across all UK sites.
What was the impact?
Production is due to start in 2015, securing all 2,100 existing jobs at the plant and paving the way to at least 700 new 
ones. Wider use of local suppliers will add further jobs locally. Meanwhile, Ellesmere Port is receiving a £125 million 
upgrade as it prepares to become a state-of-the-art 24/7 manufacturing operation.
The principles of Investors in People underpin every aspect of Vauxhall Motors’ strategy, and Vauxhall is using 
the Standard to shape its future direction.

in performance across the nine criteria. It is based on the concept that an organisation will 
achieve better results by involving all the people in the organisation in the continuous improve-
ment of their processes. The ‘Model’ is designed to be non-prescriptive. It is not a standard; it 
does not tell you what to do, but is there to provide guidelines.
Organisations are able to benchmark themselves against others both within and outside 
their sectors. The basic assumption is that excellent results in terms of performance, custom-
ers, people and society (the results) are achieved through leadership driving policy and strat-
egy, people, partnerships and resources, and processes (the enablers). Innovation and learning 
are key to improving enablers that in turn improve results. (See Figure 16.9.)
The nine criteria of the ‘Model’
Each of the nine criteria featured in the ‘Model’ are described as follows:
	1.	 Leadership. How leaders develop and facilitate the achievement of the mission and vision, 
develop values for long-term success and implement these via appropriate actions and 
behaviours, and are personally involved in ensuring that the organisation’s management 
system is developed and implemented.
	2.	 Strategy. How the organisation implements its mission and vision via a clear stakeholder-
focused strategy, supported by relevant policies, plans, objectives, targets and processes.
	3.	 People. How the organisation manages, develops and releases the knowledge and full potential 
of its people at an individual, team-based and organisation-wide level, and plans these activi-
ties in order to support its policy and strategy and the effective operation of its processes.
	4.	 Partnerships and resources. How the organisation plans and manages its external partner-
ships and internal resources in order to support its policy and strategy and the effective 
operation of its processes.
	5.	 Processes, products and services. How the organisation designs, manages and improves its 
processes in order to support its policy and strategy and fully satisfy, and generate increas-
ing value for, its customers and other stakeholders.
	6.	 Customer results. What the organisation is achieving in relation to its external customers.

 Management development 
 An environment of increasing business competitiveness, rapid change and technological inno-
vations has highlighted the growing importance of  management development. The ‘Ability 
to Attract, Retain and Develop Top Talent’ is another of the nine measures of success by 
which  Management Today rates performance in its annual survey of Britain’s Most Admired 
Companies. In particular, the general movement towards greater employee involvement and 
managing the people resource has emphasised an integrating rather than a controlling style 
of management. Managers need a balance of technical, social and conceptual knowledge and 
skills, acquired through a blend of education and experience. There is, therefore, a continual 
need for organisations to ensure the development of both present and future managers. 
 Reports from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and the Char-
tered Management Institute (CMI) both draw attention to the importance of management 
development. 
 The CIPD has emphasised the crucial importance of management development to organi-
sations’ success, and to management capability as a driver for growth. 
 There is now a solid body of research evidence that shows that fi rms with a more-qualifi ed 
management workforce and a dedicated programme of management development perform 
better and have more-sophisticated and higher-quality product market strategies. 
 Management and leadership skills play a crucial role in terms of economic enablers, skills 
investment, employee engagement and high-performance working practices. However, UK 
managers are generally less educated than their international counterparts and receive less 
management development. Part of the problem in improving management capability is resist-
ance to change and identifying a clear causal link between management development and 
improvement in business performance. There is also still a distinct lack of recognition of the 
value of people management skills within management development in general. 43 
 From a national survey of 4,500 managers, together with focus groups, interviews and case 
studies, the CMI reports on the business benefi ts of management and leadership development 
(MLD). Findings highlight considerable scope for improving the eff ectiveness of UK manage-
ment and, by doing so, improving organisational performance. Higher-performing organi-
sations invest 36 per cent more on MLD than low-performing organisations. The research 
indicated that in addition to a fi nancial commitment to MLD, a range of associated factors 
is associated clearly with higher performance. A combination of commitment to MLD, align-
ment to business strategy and supporting HR practices explains as much as 32 per cent of the 
increase in people performance and 23 per cent in overall organisational performance. 44  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 many top executives make the point that they have no formal management education or qualifications, and empha-
sise the importance of on-the-job experience. many organisations waste time and money on the development of 
staff but then prevent them using their new ideas in practice. 
 What is YOUR view of management development? How do you think YOU can be best prepared for a potential 
managerial position?

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Succession planning
Management succession planning aims to ensure that a sufficient supply of appropriately 
qualified and capable men and women is available to meet the future needs of the organ-
isation. Such people should be available readily to fill managerial or supervisory vacancies 
caused through retirement, death, resignation, promotion or transfer of staff, or through the 
establishment of new positions. Succession planning should be related to the overall corporate 
strategy. According to the CMI, ‘succession planning is more specific in its focus than talent 
management and tends to concentrate on key positions within senior management, including 
the chief executive officer and board members’.45
Baroness Kingsmill warns of the danger in replacing one leader with another from 
the same mould and the tendency of CEOs to recruit in their own image. It is inevitable 
that an organisational culture that centres on the leader develops. One of the downsides 
of succession planning is the danger that a single leadership type will prevail: ‘A long-
term commitment to talent development that encourages a mix of styles, capabilities and 
approaches can help to ensure that an organisation is responsive to change as well as 
resilient to crisis.’46
Planned career progression
Allied to management development and succession planning, there should be a programme of 
planned career progression. This should provide potential managers with:
● training and experience to equip them to assume a level of responsibility compatible with 
their ability; and
● practical guidance, encouragement and support so that they may realise their potential, 
satisfy their career ambition and wish to remain with the organisation.
Career progression should involve individual appraisal and counselling. However, care should 
be taken to avoid giving staff too long or over-ambitious career expectations. If these expecta-
tions cannot be fulfilled, staff may become disillusioned and frustrated.
Continuing professional development
In recent years, greater recognition has been given to the significance of lifelong learning and 
to continuing professional development (CPD). Lifelong learning should, however, be the con-
cern of all employees in the organisation and (despite the title) it is arguable that the concept 
of CPD should not be seen as applying only to professionals or managers as opposed to all 
employees.
Clearly, however, CPD does have particular significance for management development. 
A number of professional bodies have developed a competence-based CPD scheme for their 
members. For example, the CMI regards CPD as vital to a successful career and requires all 
members to make a commitment to their own professional development. Submission of a 
detailed CPD record is an integral and compulsory part of gaining the status of ‘Chartered 
Manager’.
Self-development
An important part of the process of improving managerial or professional performance is self-
development. This demands the ability to identify clearly real development needs and goals, to 
take responsibility for actions to reach these goals and to recognise opportunities for learning. 

Chapter 16  Organisational performance and development
595
Self-development has to be self-initiated and continued throughout your working life. But if 
this is to be a realistic aim it requires an organisational climate that will encourage people to 
develop themselves and the active support of top management. People need sufficient author-
ity and flexibility to take advantage of situations that are likely to extend their knowledge 
and skills. Superiors should be prepared to delegate new and challenging projects, including 
problem-solving assignments.
The future of management and leadership
Against the background of doldrums in the UK economy and shattered trust in business lead-
ers, an all-party Parliamentary Group on Management formed the Commission on the Future 
of Management and Leadership with the CIM, launched in October 2013. Responding to the 
following major challenges is vital if UK management is improved in order to deliver success 
by the year 2020:47
● The UK lags behind many competitors on key economic indicators.
● Younger generations will drive new ways of working.
● Managers will need to be adequately trained.
● Technology demands better people skills.
● Globalisation will drive diversity and more cross-cultural working.
● Long-term sustainability is fundamental.
The report refers to the state of UK management and leadership today including:
● Concerns about management effectiveness – Good management is crucial to driving growth 
and productivity, but many of today’s managers are simply not up to the job.
● Ethics – Four-fifths of workers do not think their manager sets a good moral example and 
less than a fifth are aware of their organisation’s values.
● Training is too little and too late – UK managers are underqualified and many are left with-
out the training and development they deserve to succeed in their jobs.
Top ten characteristics needed by managers
The evidence found that anyone can be a manager and anyone can be a good manager. The 
Commission identified the ten key characteristics of highly effective leaders and managers in 
the twenty-first century:
	1.	 Clear sense of purpose.
	2.	 Strong values and personal integrity.
	3.	 Commitment to developing others through coaching and mentoring.
	4.	 Champion of diversity.
	5.	 Ability to engage and communicate across all levels.
	6.	 Self-awareness and taking time to reflect.
	7.	 Collaboration, networked and non-hierarchical.
	8.	 Agile and innovative, technologically curious and savvy.
	9.	 Personal resilience and grit.
	10.	 Excellent track record of delivery.
We need managers who inspire and support their teams to succeed. These managers should 
be recruited not only for their technical skills they possess but also because they have the right 
attitudes, values and ethics. They should be managers who are assessed and paid not only on 
their results, but on how they achieve them.

 Management and organisational behaviour in action case study 
 CEZ Distribution Bulgaria JSC 
 ceZ distribution Bulgaria Jsc is a part of the ceZ Jsc, one of the largest energy companies in europe, the market 
leader for central and eastern europe. some 2,700 employees work in the company and provide a continuous sup-
ply of quality electricity to 2.2 million customers. 
 the management and employees accepted the change, which became a priority for them, to meet the 
growing needs of its customers, to protect the interests of the shareholders, to respond to pressure from the 
external environment and to increase the effi  ciency of investment and implemented innovative solutions and 
technologies. 
 ceZ distribution Bulgaria Jsc adopted investors in people as a global standard for best-practice people man-
agement. By engaging and developing people the company aimed to reveal and realize its potential to achieve its 
strategic goals. covering everything from business planning and leadership to eff ectively managing and measuring 
results, investors in people helped to get the outcomes strived for. 
 in 2013 the company’s management team redesigned its vision and mission, and set clear strategic goals and 
relevant development priorities. the ongoing communication with and involvement of people in this process were 
of primary importance. the fl exible framework of investors in people helped the company to achieve its own unique 
business goals. On the way to achieving high recognition, corporate principles were very closely linked to the values 
of investors in people, a strong leadership and management strategy was put in place and highly effi  cient people 
management practices were applied. 
 What was the impact? 
 the investors in people Bronze accreditation is just the beginning of our journey of continuous improvement. We 
acquired a better understanding of change management for improving business performance through eff ective 
people management. the successful implementation of the organisational change improved team eff ectiveness. We 
had massive communication from and feedback to 2,500 employees. 
 the seven corporate values underpinned and aligned the competency model for each management level and 
people. they are in the hearts of people and a powerful driver for transformation in behaviour and performance. 
clearly defi ned key performance indicators of top management to the fi rst operational level were linked to the stra-
tegic objectives. 
 We have achieved a reduction in operating costs. the level of work accidents in compliance with health and safety 
requirements has been minimised. We have developed management and leadership competencies, and measured 
and improved team management eff ectiveness. 
 How did IIP help? 
 investors in people gave us the courage to set high goals and achieve more and more. With a strong top man-
agement, focused on continuous improvement, clearly defi ned key performance indicators and corporate social 
responsibility, we went beyond the core standard. principles of iip guide our work in one direction, allowing us to be 
more eff ective. We have focused our eff orts on increasing the effi  ciency of people by providing learning that evolves 
their potential and improves their knowledge and skills. iip is a standardised, outcome-based way of working that 
leads to better people management.

Organisational capabilities
Research from The Boston Consulting Group and twelve partner organisations, including the 
CMI, demonstrate clearly that organisational capabilities drive corporate success. Behavioural 
aspects, often seen as tangential, are vital differentiators – but only when they accompany 
structural capabilities such as superior organisational design and rigorous business process 
and controls. The study points out that although the world’s best organisations may look like 
many of their competitors, under closer examination there are distinct combinations of win-
ning attributes. The study developed a framework of twenty discrete organisational capabili-
ties under six sub-categories: structural design, roles and collaboration mechanisms, processes 
and tools, leadership, people and engagement, and culture and change. (See Figure 16.10.)

  All 20 organizational capabilities have an impact on overall performance – though clearly 
some have more infl uence than others. Even more interesting: there is a defi nite tilt towards 
behavioral factors – in particular leadership, employee engagement, and cross-functional 
collaboration. 48  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 there are varying measures of organisational performance that can be viewed at different levels, over different time 
spans and in different ways by competing interest groups. it is not realistic to establish clear universal criteria for the 
measurement of organisational success. 
 What are YOUR views? What specific measures of organisational effectiveness can YOU identify for YOUR university 
or organisation? How effective are these measures? 
 The future of the workplace 
 Management Today in association with Smart Technologies explored changes in how we work 
and the nature of the work environment.  Gyther points out that the workplace is in a state of 
fl ux, which is down to a variety of factors: cost, carbon, technology, sustainability and culture. 
  People still accept that it’s very important for an organisation to have a clear defi nition of 
what it is and how to go effi  ciently about achieving its aims, but how does the working envi-
ronment play its part? The workplace is becoming more fragmented – people aren’t working 
under the same roof as they were even 20 years ago. 
 In addition to environmental concerns and globalisation, other issues raised in a round table 
debate included: 
 ●  How to get people to collaborate in real time across diff erent parts of the world. 
 ●  The design of offi  ce space to be more open to encourage greater creativity. 
 ●  A danger that offi  ce design driven by technological development ignores the human cultural 
dimensions of work. 
 ●  With the move towards more fl exible working and remote working, how will businesses 
that are built on the accumulation of the experience and skills of their people respond if 
those people are never together? 
 ●  The focus on interactive technology and bringing people together using technology. 
 ●  What is the speed of change of human behaviour to facilitate culture, organisation and a 
sense of belonging in a new set of environments? How to manage the transition of behav-
iour when everyone is stressed and insecure. 
 ●  The idea of a clean desk, the layering of technology, increased offi  ce size because of han-
dling emails, the lack of reading. 
 ●  The dramatic change in work, which is now much more complicated. People working in 
diff erent locations across diff erent time zones but, at present, an extremely low understand-
ing of virtual teaming. 49 
  Successful organisations and people 
 The overall eff ectiveness of the organisation will be aff ected both by sound structural design 
and by individuals fi lling the various positions within the structure. Management will need to 
acknowledge the existence of the informal organisation that arises from the interactions of 

Chapter 16  Organisational performance and development
599
people working in the organisation. The operation of the organisation and actual working 
arrangements will be influenced by the style of management, the personalities of members 
and the informal organisation. These factors may lead to differences between the formal struc-
ture of the organisation and what happens in practice. Stewart found the relationship between 
people and organisation to be reciprocal.
People modify the working of the formal organization, but their behaviour is also influenced 
by it. It may make demands on them which they find an undue strain, so that they seek ways 
of modifying these pressures. The method of work organization can determine how people 
relate to one another, which may affect both their productivity and their morale. Manag-
ers, therefore, need to be conscious of the ways in which methods of work organization may 
influence people’s attitudes and actions. Before behaviour is put down to individual or group 
cussedness, managers should look for its possible organizational causes.50
Building an organisation involves more than concern for structure, methods of work and 
­technical efficiency. The hallmark of many successful business organisations is the attention 
given to the human element; to the development of a culture that helps to create a feeling 
of belonging, commitment and satisfaction. Structure must be designed, therefore, so as to 
maintain the balance of the socio-technical system and the effectiveness of the organisation as 
a whole. Attention must be given to the interactions between both the structural and techno-
logical requirements of the organisation, and social factors and the needs and demands of the 
human part of the organisation.
The importance of people for organisational effectiveness is reinforced by a survey under-
taken by the MCA and Management Today. The survey emphasises that the role of the organ-
isation is social as well as economic and points to the desperate need for the basic, softer skills 
of managers in leadership, coaching and mentoring. Organisations need individuals they can 
trust, who are engaged in and committed to their work. If they want to survive, organisations 
need to recognise that they have to add value to their employees, that their social capital is just 
as important as their financial capital.51
People, diversity and organisational performance
An underlying consideration of the people element in work organisations of the future is atten-
tion to respect for individual differences and diversity (discussed in Chapter 4), and positive 
action on equality and inclusion. With increasing globalisation it is of greater importance to 
have a sound understanding of diverse countries and workforces. More than ever, effective 
organisational performance demands the successful management of diversity. For example, 
The Institute of Employment Studies, in conjunction with the CMI, emphasise the importance 
of diversity as a strategic priority for retaining and developing key people in the organisation.52
And the CMI also reminds us that:
Many of us work in diverse environments, and even in more homogeneous workplaces, 
employees could well be dealing with clients from a variety of backgrounds, particularly in 
global businesses. Therefore, in the face of the trend towards greater diversity in both the 
workplace itself, and in the societies and markets that organisations serve, it is up to manag-
ers to make the most of this new, more diverse world that we all find ourselves in. Greater 
diversity, and the benefits that diversity bring, will only occur if there is genuine enthusiasm 
for the concept throughout the organisation. Actions taken to encourage greater diversity 
should not be tokenistic, isolated instances, but should be part of a broader mindset that sees 
diversity as an important part of any successful company.53
A word of caution
Any student of management or reader of this book will realise there is no shortage of ideas 
on how to improve organisational performance. Understanding the latest concepts and pro-
nouncements of leading writers is a part of a manager’s development, and there clearly are 

600
part 4 strUctUre, strategY and effectiveness
potential benefi ts to be gained for both the individual and the organisation. However, as 
 Stern reminds us, great ideas in business rise and fall, and favoured management styles and 
approaches come into and go out of fashion almost as fast as in the fashion industry. 
  Management is both science and art, and the trick of it lies in separating the good ideas 
from the bad, knowing when to be scientifi c and when to be artful . . . Here is Management 
Today’s unfashionable contribution to the great fashion of management ideas: show a real 
interest in what people are doing for you. It matters. 54  
 Critical review and refl ection 
 according to a senior researcher at the Work foundation, there is no incontrovertible evidence that links company 
well-being to increased organisational performance. 55 so presumably attempting to establish clear links between the 
process of management and organisational effectiveness is a waste of time. 
 What is YOUR response to this assertion? How would YOU describe the relationship within YOUR own university and/
or organisation? 
 Ten key points to remember 
  1   every work organisation is concerned with being eff ective. the quality of management and 
commitment of staff  are central to the success of the organisation. 
  2   increasing attention is given to the attributes and qualities of a manager, to the development 
of social and human skills, and to the ability to work well with people. 
  3   there is a clear and important need for managerial eff ectiveness. managers are judged not just 
on their own performance but on results achieved by other staff . 
  4  an essential ingredient of any successful manager is understanding the needs and expectations 
of staff , and the ability to work through and with other people. 
  5   a key factor in organisational eff ectiveness is the successful management of change and atten-
tion to the learning organisation and the continuous learning for all staff . 
  6  One approach to improved organisational performance is the idea of total quality manage-
ment, associated with the concepts of kaizen and the balanced scorecard. 
  7  among factors contributing to a healthy organisational climate is the extent to which members 
of staff  have a sense of engagement with and commitment to their work. 
  8  Other important contributions to organisational eff ectiveness are the work of investors in peo-
ple and the european foundation for Quality management. 
  9   in an increasingly competitive environment, attention must be given to management develop-
ment, the future of management and leadership, and succession planning. 
  10  the hallmark of many successful organisations is attention given to human and behavioural 
aspects and development of a culture of belonging, commitment and satisfaction.

 co-operatives are a distinctive form of organisation with 
a long history. the international co-operative alliance 
(ica) website provides a defi nition: 
 Co-operatives are businesses owned and run by and for 
their members. Whether the members are the customers, 
employees or residents they have an equal say in what 
the business does and a share in the profits. 57  
 While shareholder-owned fi rms may have emerged as 
the dominant model in producing goods and services 
in most markets today, co-operative organisations can 
often be found alongside them. their combined impor-
tance is greater than many might realise: the european 
commission’s website reports that co-operatives: 
 are an important part of European economic life and 
industry; there are 250,000 co-operative enterprises 
in the European Union, owned by 163 million 
citizens (1 in 3 EU citizens) and they employ 5.4 
million people. 58  
 in the ica’s list of the world’s top 300 co-operatives,  59 
the importance of co-ops in banking and fi nance, retail, 
agriculture and a range of other sectors can clearly be 
seen, as well as the co-operative identity of some very 
well-known names around the world. the UK is not as

urbanisation, working people had to rely upon buying 
food, rather than growing their own, and co-operative 
organisations grew up to protect the interests of workers

against those of more powerful suppliers, who were 
often also employers.61
One of the key milestones in the history of co-opera-
tives took place in 1844 in the north of England:
In 1843, workers in the textile mills of Rochdale, 
England went on strike. When the strike failed, the 
millworkers began to look for other ways to improve 
their lives. Instead of calling for another strike or 
asking charitable groups for help, some of these people 
decided to take control of one of the most immediate 
and pressing areas of their lives. They believed they 
needed their own food store as an alternative to the 
company store. Twenty-eight people founded the 
Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society.
After saving money for over a year, these pioneers 
opened their co-op store at 31 Toad Lane on a cold 
December evening in 1844. Although the founders 
agreed to sell just butter, sugar, flour, and oatmeal, they 
also offered tallow candles for sale that night. They were 
forced to buy candles because the gas company refused to 
supply gas for the new group’s lights. They bought candles 
in bulk and sold what they didn’t use to their members.62
This venture was one of the earliest formal co-operative 
structures, whose founding principles are still an impor-
tant statement of the values of the contemporary co-
operative movement. The Rochdale principles (as they 
are now known) are set out below:63
1.	 Open membership.
2.	 Democratic control (one man, one vote).
3.	 Distribution of surplus in proportion to trade.
4.	 Payment of limited interest on capital.
5.	 Political and religious neutrality.
6.	 Cash trading.
7.	 Promotion of education.
These principles are an important clue to the distinc-
tive nature of co-operatives today. Democratic con-
trol remains a cornerstone of the co-operative way of 
doing things: members must debate and then choose; 
the direction taken by the organisation will be the one 
chosen by the majority. Note the difference with share-
holder-owned companies, in which ‘votes’ are pro-
portional to the numbers of shares held, meaning that 
large institutional shareholders will usually outweigh 
private investors by a large margin. The third and fourth 
principles are also importantly distinctive: in a share-
holder-owned company, rewards are proportional to 
shareholdings, but in a co-operative, rewards are deter-
mined by participation rates; in a co-op shop, the divi-
dend is proportional to the amounts bought. As will be 
discussed below, the insight that co-operative members 
are better understood as users than investors is impor-
tant in analysing members’ motivation and behaviour.
Co-operatives and organisational 
behaviour
Co-operatives as organisational forms are of interest 
theoretically because of the effect of the unusual struc-
ture on incentives and behaviour. It is sometimes sug-
gested, for example, that co-operatives are more likely 
than investor-owned firms to suffer from the ‘problem 
of the commons’ in economics: where the assets are in 
the hands of everyone but not in the hands of anyone, 
why should any member refrain from using the assets in 
ways that may damage them (i.e. overgrazing, in terms 
of the original problem)?
Other concerns have focused on the theoretical 
problems of co-operative decision-making by large 
numbers of members with diverse priorities and inter-
ests. Borgen64 suggests that some of these perceived 
difficulties may result from a misleading assumption 
about the outlook and motivation of co-operative 
members: that they are akin to investors in a firm. If such 
an assumption were true, then analysing the decision-
making problem in terms of property rights and agent/
principal relationships would be justified. However, in 
his view, co-operative members are far more realistically 
understood as users, rather than investors: the fact that 
they have chosen to join suggests a strong interest in the 
output of the organisation. The member as user, then, 
will think differently from an investor and have a strong 
incentive to take part in decision-making.
From humble beginnings in this nineteenth-century Lan-
cashire store, the co-operative movement has inspired a 
form of business organisation that now accounts for up 
to 100 million employees around the world.

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
Whatever the answer to these theoretical ques-
tions, there is certainly a strong continuing interest in 
co-operatives as a way of getting things done. A report 
by strategy consultants Booz Allen Hamilton65 reviewed 
progress in the sector and suggested six distinctive fea-
tures of co-operatives that allow these organisations to 
compete in the tough markets of today:
● Consensual decision-making – Co-operatives take 
a longer time in consulting members, but make 
up that time when it comes to implementation, in 
terms of both speed and quality.
● Better communication – Because of the stronger 
emphasis on member and employee communica-
tion, co-operatives find it easier to identify and draw 
upon the skills and enthusiasm of the organisation 
and also experience better customer loyalty.
● Leadership development in the company and 
community – Co-operatives have a long-term focus 
on developing a skill base, linked to a traditional 
commitment to education.
● Long-range planning and experimentation – ­Without 
the extreme pressure to deliver financial results that 
shareholder-owned companies often experience, co-
operatives can think and invest over longer time scales 
and carry their membership with them.
● Openness to learning best practices – Co-operatives 
seem ready to learn from the experience of other co-
operatives, often operating in different markets, but 
with important lessons and insights to offer.
● The social dimension – The co-operative model is 
particularly effective in assisting the development of 
emerging economies, by providing a model frame-
work for entrepreneurship and management, which 
in turn can encourage a wider range of people to 
become involved.
Since the 2008–9 global financial crisis, co-operatives 
have often coped relatively well with the turbulent 
business conditions, possibly for some of the reasons 
discussed in the Booz Allen Hamilton report. The UK’s 
Nationwide, for example, has grown successfully and is 
now the country’s largest building society, having stood 
back from the trend towards demutualisation in the 
1980s and 1990s.
Elsewhere in the sector, however, the picture has 
been less encouraging: the acute problems at the UK’s 
Co-operative Bank (part of the Co-operative Group) 
hit the headlines in 2013 when a planned purchase of 
hundreds of branches from state-supported Lloyds Bank 
fell through.66 In the following weeks, major problems 
emerged, many of which related to the bank’s purchase 
of Britannia Building Society in 2009.67 Although this 
crisis involved unusual problems of leadership and gov-
ernance at the Co-operative Bank,68 its underlying busi-
ness problem of having taken on much more risk than 
it could manage was all too reminiscent of the much 
larger bank failures in 2008–9. By 2014, the Co-operative 
Group’s ownership of its Bank had fallen to 30 per cent, 
with the cruel irony of the remaining share being held by 
US institutions, including hedge funds.69 Furthermore, in 
March 2014 Euan Sutherland (formerly Chief Executive 
of B&Q) resigned as Chief Executive of the wider Co-op 
Group, suggesting that it was ‘impossible’ to overhaul 
the ailing business because of its complex governance 
structure.
What is to be learnt from this disappointing set of 
events? Perhaps no more than this: the co-operative 
model contains a number of distinctive features that 
should allow it to be the basis for a secure, trustworthy 
and successful provision of financial services. The ICA 
list of the top 300 co-operatives in the world70 shows 
that this is very much the rule across a range of coun-
tries. The UK’s experience with the Co-operative Bank 
shows that a poorly managed co-operative is unlikely to 
be successful, which is hardly surprising. Well-managed 
co-operatives abound and remain in business because 
of the quality of service that they provide.
In a sense, organisations have always had the prime 
purpose of facilitating people in working together and 
overcoming the problems that arise. The co-operative 
model may not have been the dominant business 
organisation so far, but it has developed a distinctive 
approach that works very well in some circumstances 
and promises much for the future.

Academic viewpoint
Below you will find the title and abstract of a recent article in an academic journal that explores a topic relevant to 
the chapters in Part 4.
May, D. R., Luth, M. T. and Schwoerer, C. E. ‘The Influence of Business Ethics Education on Moral Efficacy, Moral 
Meaningfulness, and Moral Courage: A Quasi-experimental Study’, Journal of Business Ethics, no. 124, 2014, pp. 
67–80. doi: 10.1007/s10551-013-1860-6
Abstract
The research described here contributes to the extant empirical research on business ethics education by examin-
ing outcomes drawn from the literature on positive organizational scholarship (POS). The general research question 
explored is whether a course on ethical decision-making in business could positively influence students’ confidence 
in their abilities to handle ethical problems at work (i.e., moral efficacy), boost the relative importance of ethics in 
their work lives (i.e., moral meaningfulness), and encourage them to be more courageous in raising ethical prob-
lems at work even if it is unpopular (i.e., moral courage). Specifically, the study used a rigorous quasi-experimental 
pretest–posttest research design with a treatment (N = 30) and control group (N = 30) to investigate whether a grad-
uate-level course in business ethics could influence students’ levels of moral efficacy, meaningfulness, and courage. 
Findings revealed that participants in the business ethics treatment course experienced significant positive increases 
in each of the three outcome variables as compared to the control group. The largest increase was in moral efficacy, 
followed by moral courage, and finally, moral meaningfulness. These findings are discussed in the context of the cur-
rent research on business ethics education and POS. Implications for future research are discussed.
Commentary
There is controversy surrounding the effectiveness of 
‘ethics’ teaching in business schools and other educa-
tional institutions and the degree to which students 
take better decisions having studied business ethics. 
While ethical reasoning may improve, this does not 
of itself lead to ethical behaviour. This study attempts 
to quantify the results of ethics training by comparing 
a study group who have taken a course in ethics and 
a control group who have not. Results suggest that 
there was a positive effect and in particular the study 
noted an improvement in individual moral courage. 
Moral courage is important even where organisations 
have formal systems of internal whistleblowing, as 
standing up for an unpopular or apparently disrup-
tive point of view is personally difficult and can lead 
to isolation and intimidation for the whistleblower. 
The authors suggest that elements of ethics education 
that provide individuals with the tools to challenge 
unethical action in a positive way are important for 
future ethics training.
The article might prompt you to consider some 
of the following questions
● Unethical behaviour can start at very junior levels 
in organisations; to what extent do you think low-
level misbehaviour (petty pilfering, minor fraud on 
expenses claims, etc.) reflects a rejection of organi-
sational power structures rather than the intention to 
behave badly?
● Given the need for individuals to develop moral 
courage, is ethical training more important for man-
agers and leaders or for front-line staff?
● How far and how can ethical behaviour be inte-
grated into organisational cultural norms by those 
with management responsibility?

Part 4 Case study
The Timpsons – solving life’s little problems
Life can be full of little annoyances: the heel comes off 
your shoe; you get egg stains on your suit jacket; you 
lose a door key or lock yourself out of your car; your 
watch battery runs out; you need a passport-style photo 
for an ID card; you drop your mobile phone and crack 
the screen. This is scarcely end-of-the-world stuff, but 
annoying and frustrating nonetheless. You need a local 
service to fix it and you want it done quickly, but at the 
same time you probably would not want to pay a lot of 
money for the job. This is where Timpson can help you 
out. With over 1,400 stores located throughout the UK 
from the Highlands to Cornwall, the company has built 
a serious and successful business out of solving some of 
life’s little problems.1 This is the story of how the little 
things can add up to something big – not just in terms 
of the size of the business, but also in the way it is struc-
tured and managed.
The company did not start out in this direction; it 
has its origins in the industrial midlands in the mid-
nineteenth century when William Timpson began to 
sell shoe laces as an 8-year-old boy. In 1870, at the 
age of 16, he opened his first shoe shop in Manchester 
and gradually built up a shoe retail and repair business 
before growing it into a shoe manufacturing company 
as well. The company flourished until the 1960s, when 
a combination of challenging business conditions and 
a family disagreement led to its being taken over by a 
larger conglomerate (United Drapery Stores), which in 
turn was bought by the Hanson Trust in 1983. This latter 
move gave John Timpson the opportunity to reacquire 
the family firm between 1983 and 1990, and having 
brought it back into his own control he decided against 
seeking external investment through a stock market 
flotation.
The fact that the company is wholly owned by John 
and his family means that he could make decisions that 
might otherwise have been unpopular with outside 
investors. For example, when profitability was falling in 
the late 1980s he was not threatened by hostile takeover 
bids that might have gained the support of shareholders 
and lost him the business once again. Certainly he had 
to make tough choices, such as the sale of its chain of 
unprofitable shoe shops in 1987 – made harder because 
they had been the core of Timpson since its foundation. 
However, the risks were taken with his own money and 
when he had the idea of combining shoe repair with 
key cutting, things began to turn a corner. Independ-
ence also allowed him to be opportunistic; taking up an 
employee’s idea of adding watch repair to the range of 
services on offer, for example, or buying two businesses 
(dry cleaning and digital photography chains) that had 
gone into administration. By 2009 it was clear that the 
recession was in fact helping rather than damaging the 
company as people became more inclined to ‘make do 
and mend’, so while the shoe-making and retail trades 
suffered both from foreign low-cost manufacturing and 
a slump in sales, demand for shoe and watch repairs 
grew.
Today the business is back in the hands of the fourth 
and fifth generations of the Timpson family as John 
Timpson, William’s great grandson, is Chairman and 
James Timpson (John’s son) the company’s Chief Execu-
tive. The two share a philosophy and outlook that has 
given the company a particular character and culture, 
although each man has made his own contribution to 
the Timpson way of doing business.
John Timpson has developed a distinctive philosophy 
that permeates the organisation and shapes its culture. 
He has published a number of books about manag-
ing, including guides to creating great teams, being a 
great boss, training people effectively and recruiting 
good staff. He writes for the business press, often par-
ticipates in broadcasts about the world of work and runs 
a blog through the company website. His approach is 
often described as ‘paternalistic’ – a term that usually 
carries negative connotations, suggesting an autocratic 
‘father-knows-best’ attitude to the workforce. However, 
his approach is anything but autocratic, and he freely 
admits that the staff are the ones who know best what 
customers want and how the business should operate. 
Certainly he has introduced a number of ‘fatherly’ perks 
for staff; they get a holiday on their birthday, there is a 
well-funded company hardship fund (loans are repaid in 
99.8 per cent of cases) and there are significant bonus 
incentives for staff to sell above target in a business 
where the average transaction is probably below £10. 
He also thinks that it is vital that he spends more than 
half the working week out and about, visiting stores and 
chatting to staff. Not only does this make him a visible 
presence, reinforcing his view and ideas about business, 
but it also provides him with a valuable source of ideas, 
as he explained in 2009:

Chapter 16  Organisational performance and development
609
I met a guy called Glen Edwards, who was operating 
our shop in West Brom. Glen said ‘I hope you don’t 
mind but I’m doing a few watch repairs, because I used 
to do watch repairs’, and I said ‘how much are you 
taking?’ He said ‘£120 this week.’ Glen now runs the 
watch repair division. Our watch repair turnover last 
week was about £270,000, so that was pretty good.2
But his paternalism does not extend to wanting to con-
trol people; in fact his approach is quite the opposite. 
He is very keen to emphasise the importance of trust 
and autonomy – an insight that has led him to develop 
Timpson’s distinctive ‘upside-down’ approach to 
management.
Managing upside down
One of the company’s beliefs is that the front-line staff 
are the most important people to the business, and all 
others – managers, accountants, HR people – are there 
to support, not govern, the front line. Things that might 
seem to threaten a ‘command and control’ approach to 
managing do not bother John Timpson. For instance, 
writing on 27 June 2014 a few days before the right to 
flexible working was extended to all UK employees, he 
explained why he was not concerned about this new 
legislation and how he had come to be an upside-down 
manager. The key, he claims, is trust.
The simple trick is to trust every colleague who serves 
your customers with the authority to do it their way. 
Give them the freedom to do their job in the way 
they know best. You can’t create great customer care 
through a set of rules. Personal service is produced by 
people who are allowed to use their initiative rather 
than following a process that tells them what to do. 
I should have cottoned on to this several years earlier 
when I read a book about Nordstrom, the US Depart-
ment store chain with a reputation for heroic sales 
clerks going well beyond the extra mile. In the middle 
of the book I saw a management chart that was upside 
down. Having seen the light, I told our shop colleagues 
they were free to do whatever they wanted as long as 
they followed two rules: 1) Look the part, and 2) Put 
the money in the till. I copied the Nordstrom chart and 
since then called our way of working ‘Upside Down 
Management’.3
He goes on to explain that the idea did not immediately 
take root, and that it took over five years to change the 
company culture into one where rules largely went out 
of the window and staff were trusted to make everyday 
decisions about things that would normally be firmly 
controlled by management. It took some radical moves, 
for example:
To emphasise their freedom I said that anyone, even 
our newest recruit, could pay up to £500 to settle a 
customer complaint without reference to anyone else, 
and I let them treat our price list as a guide (they had 
my permission to charge whatever they wanted).4
As it turned out, the biggest challenge to upside-down 
management was the managers themselves.
The biggest task was to stop our managers issuing 
orders and persuade them to concentrate on giving 
praise, help and support, rather than policing a pro-
cess. It isn’t easy for managers to delegate authority 
while keeping responsibility; most executives do it the 
other way round.5
He is also of the view that modern management has 
made business life too complex, and managers should 
be ready to let go a bit:
Policies, governance, company rules, appraisals and 
budgets which often come with a generous sprinkling 
of company politics, can make work pretty stress-
ful . . . Rigid managers don’t do themselves any good 
by insisting that everyone sticks to the rules . . . Having 
the trust of your boss and being allowed to work in a 
way that suits you is a major contributor to wellbeing.
Along with the need to re-educate managers about 
their approach, there was also a problem relating to the 
staff, and the recruitment and training processes also 
had to undergo some major change in order to make 
upside-down management work.
The biggest lesson we learnt was about our people. 
Our upside down way of working only succeeds with 
the right characters. Our recruitment was all wrong; 
we were looking for cobblers and key cutters, when 
we should have been picking people with personality.

Part 4  Structure, strategy and effectiveness
We can teach a guy with character how to cut keys 
but you can’t put personality into a grumpy cobbler. 
Eventually upside down management worked so well 
in our shops (service got better and sales went up) I 
extended the principles to everyone else. Whatever the 
role in our business you are free to do your job the way  
you want.6
Mr Keen, Miss Ambitious, Mr Happy and 
Mrs Helpful – but no drongos!
The upside-down approach is not, however, all warm 
and cuddly. The business emphasises customer service 
and, as can be seen from the point above about grumpy 
cobblers, Timpson needs a particular type of employee. 
The company website makes it clear that Timpson is 
looking for happy and helpful people who dress smartly, 
‘act the part’ and put money in the till. Moody, scruffy, 
rude or unreliable people will not last long at Timpson; 
‘drongos’ (as John and James call them) have to go and 
the company is pretty ruthless in getting rid of those 
whom it believes are holding the teams back. James 
Timpson describes it as a duty to get rid of bad work-
ers as quickly as possible; fairly, honestly and legally yes, 
but quickly nevertheless. As Timpson has a waiting list of 
about 200 people seeking employment with it, for every 
drongo there is probably a replacement ready and wait-
ing to join. This ruthlessness might be seen as the dark 
side of a paternalistic management philosophy, and it is 
no easy task to be a Timpson manager. Area managers 
must be prepared to confront underperformance and 
weed it out quickly. They get extensive training in disci-
plinary and dismissal processes (John Timpson has pub-
lished a management guide on the subject), and anyone 
who is not comfortable with the approach is unlikely to 
get promoted. By contrast, the ambitious will find their 
career advancing very quickly, as James explained in an 
interview with HR Magazine in 2009:
if you are good then it will be a bloody quick promo-
tion, and if you are crap then you’ll leave.7
James is not particularly impressed by professional HR 
managers either, viewing them as potentially disruptive 
to the upside-down approach to running the business:
They try to take over. Every business we’ve taken over 
has had a bossy HR person. It’s not the most important 
part of a business – HR is to support the front line; it is 
not there to tell staff what to do.8
The business may have over 3,000 employees but there 
are no more than seven members in the HR team, which 
comprises a head of people support and four regional 
HR specialists, a training manager and a dedicated 
health and safety officer; payroll is run from the com-
pany finance office. The people side of work is very 
much part of the local manager’s job.
The Timpson Academy
Being unencumbered by the need to satisfy external 
investors and shareholders has left the Timpsons in a 
position to experiment with slightly unusual approaches 
to the business. One such has been James Timpson’s 
initiative to give the chance of employment to people 
who often struggle to find a job – ex-prisoners. The idea 
stemmed from a visit he made to HMP Thorncross in 
Warrington, not far from the company offices in Man-
chester. He recalled the occasion during a press inter-
view in 2013 saying that:
They gave me a guide, Matthew, who was about 18 
and I really liked him. So I said ‘when you’re out, don’t 
tell anybody, but I’ll give you a job’. He’s still with us 
today. He’s brilliant.9
However, the early attempts to recruit more routinely 
from the prison were not altogether successful:
A third of people in prison are right for employment, 
a third have significant health problems which means 
they are not ready for employment and a third are 
people I would not want to have in my business. That’s 
either because of the crimes they committed – we don’t 
employ any sex offenders – or they are just bad bas-
tards. I’d put them in shops and they’d nick money off 
us. They’d fight in the shop. Their drug dealer mates 
would be coming in. If it’s going to go wrong it goes 
really wrong.10
The strategy had to become more focused and selec-
tive, and now the company employs two colleagues 
who visit prisons (they now work with about seventy 
institutions nationwide) to interview potential recruits 
and mentor them, giving the opportunity to develop 
the personal skills they will need for life on the outside. 
James explains that the successful recruits tend to have 
similar histories:
There’s a similar pattern: in care or failed at school, 
got in with a bad lot, started drugs, drinking, nicking 
cars, got banged up. Most people we have have been 
to prison more than once. But they get to a stage where 
they want to get a job and be normal and stop the 
chaos.11
It is essential, James believes, to get people into the job 
as soon as they are released:
If you leave jail today you start working for us tomor-
row. The longer the gap, the more likely it is there’ll be 

Chapter 16  Organisational performance and development
611
problems. If recruits don’t have anywhere to live we’ll 
find somewhere and pay the deposit. They are pretty 
damaged these people. If you just expect them to turn 
up and work the next day it’s not going to happen.12
In some cases prisoners, or ‘foundation colleagues’ as 
Timpson prefers to call them, nearing the end of their 
sentence will be recruited and work during the day on 
the ROTL (Release On Temporary Licence) scheme, and 
some are even managing shops:
They take the money, serve the customers, bank the 
money, lock the door and then go back to prison.
Three ‘academies’ based inside prisons additionally 
teach potential recruits the basics of key cutting, shoe 
and watch repair and customer service.
This might sound idealistic and philanthropic, and in 
many respects it is a socially responsible thing for any 
company to be doing. But there is also a business case. 
Prisons can be a source of talent, and as James observes:
I’d be mad to turn away profit because I don’t want to 
employ someone who happens to have been to prison 
for a bit of their life.13
He also notes that they are very loyal, and prison life 
has disciplined them into being punctual. Not only that, 
but once on board the foundation colleagues show a 
similar retention rate to those recruited through more 
usual routes. Approximately 10 per cent of Timpson’s 
workforce are ex-convicts, and for many of them the 
work is what enabled them to break out of the cycle of 
repeat offending, as one such colleague observed.
I think it’s better what Timpson’s doing than what the 
prisons are doing. I’d been to prison three times before I 
joined Timpson and I had no rehabilitation at all really. 
With Timpson they are giving you a career. If I’d just 
come out again I would have probably fallen back into 
the same routine. You go to job interviews and they 
ask you if you’ve got a criminal conviction and if you 
say yes you’re immediately at the bottom of the pile. 
There’s no rehabilitation for prisoners outside prison 
apart from companies like Timpson that are prepared 
to give you the chance.14
Scattering magic dust
The company website explains the Timpson approach 
in a short presentation called ‘Magic Dust’ (http://www.
timpson.co.uk/about/25/magic-dust). It explains the 
components of its management philosophy in twenty-
eight bullet points,15 the last of which is ‘Family Busi-
ness’. Over the years it has won a number of awards 
and accolades, being placed highly in The Sunday Times 
and Financial Times ‘100 Best Workplaces’ lists as well as 
gaining several awards for its work with prisoners and in 
re-settling ex-offenders.16 For a low-tech, grassroots and 
unglamorous company, working upside down seems to 
be doing the trick.
Tasks

The contents of this book have drawn attention to the importance of features that 
relate to the development of your personal skills and employability. Referring back 
to the diagram on page xxiii consider carefully the following examples:
● Self-awareness and confidence – for example:
 
be mindful of how your attitudes, beliefs and values impact on others; admit to 
your perceptual bias, distortions and errors; recognise the nature of your work 
orientation and work ethic; acknowledge your strengths and shortcomings.
● Relationships with others – for example:
 
demonstrate respect and empathy towards other people; display awareness of 
social interactions and influences; accept formal hierarchical and organisational 
relationships; acknowledge different individual needs and expectations at work.
● Communication and presentation skills – for example:
 
be able to converse well with other people; be sensitive to non-verbal commu-
nications and body language; contribute meaningful participation in class and 
seminar activities; present clear, coherent and persuasive reports and other writ-
ten documents.
● Working in groups and teams – for example:
 
work constructively and harmoniously with colleagues; accept group consensus 
and decision-making; recognise the roles you perform best and the contribution 
you make; accept the importance and impact of the informal organisation.
● Dealing with difficult situations – for example:
 
accept conflict as a reality of management and organisational behaviour; be able 
to cope with potentially stressful work situations; display support and empathy in 
responding to practical or emotional needs of colleagues.
● Influencing others and leadership – for example:
 
interrelate well with working colleagues; recognise how your own values and 
beliefs impact on others; be mindful of the attributes and qualities required of an 
effective leader; judge your readiness for a leadership role.
● Coping with and managing change – for example:
 
acknowledge the continuous pace of change; adapt to the changing face of the 
workplace and need for flexibility; accept the increasing importance of commu-
nications information technology within work organisations.
● Observing ethical behaviour – for example:
 
honour corporate social responsibilities and codes of conduct; respect the role, 
status and authority of senior members of staff; recognise pluralistic approaches 
to power; demonstrate ethical values and behaviour.
APPENDIX Review of personal 
skills and employability

614
APPENDIX Review of personal skills and employability
● Working in multicultural organisations – for example:
 
embrace the impact and benefits of diversity; understand the pervasive influence 
of organisation culture; be able to work harmoniously with people of different 
ethnic origin, gender, age, sexual orientation, religious beliefs or social class.
● Displaying managerial potential – for example:
 
prioritise effectively your time; accept the need for lifelong learning and personal 
development; participate actively in management development programmes; 
accept responsibility for your self-development and career progression.
Use these examples to reflect upon the extent to which you have enhanced your 
awareness and knowledge of such features, and are better prepared to demonstrate 
your personal skills and employability, and aid your career progression.
Remember to update your personal profile.
Concluding exercise
Definitions of organisational behaviour (OB) generally relate to improving organisa-
tional performance and effectiveness. Accordingly, underlying your study of OB has 
been the interrelationship with that of management and the social and human skills 
that reflect the ability to work well with other people. The development of personal 
skills in management and leadership plays a crucial role in terms of both your future 
career employability and continued contribution to organisational success.
Exercise: how good are you at managing and leading at 
the same time?
In the below table there are two lists of different attributes. For each attribute in 
both columns rate yourself using the scale below. Where possible rate yourself in a 
particular situation or job context.
How well do the following attributes describe your behaviour? Rate each item: 
always (5); mostly (4); sometimes (3); seldom (2); never (1).
Column A
Column B
Quick to recognise problem situations that require 
attention and action
Willing to hear and consider alternatives from others, even 
if they are different to one’s own
Know where one is headed and the results to be achieved
Good at listening to others and taking seriously what they 
have to say
Work to high standards of efficiency and effectiveness – 
get the job done well and on time
Take an interest in individuals and their abilities and what 
makes them tick
Focus on one issue at a time, giving full attention to 
reaching a conclusion
Favour listening and understanding to talking
Aware of what is and what is not important and focus on 
priorities
Handle conflict and disagreements with patience and try 
to find the answer to suit both parties
Think clearly and logically, working through problems in 
an orderly and logical manner
Aware of one’s own strengths and weaknesses and how 
one comes across to others

615
APPENDIX Review of personal skills and employability
Column A
Column B
Gather facts and information before drawing conclusions
Work well in a team and with others; can be described as 
co-operative and a team player
Work out, beforehand, the best way to tackle a problem 
or do the job
Know when to be tough and push hard and when to ease 
back when dealing with others
Fix problems and also prevent their recurrence by 
removing the cause
Consider who to involve and the best way to involve them 
before taking action
Follow up to check and rectify things if they have gone 
wrong
Explore what people feel and how they will react before 
taking action
Scoring
To score your own balance between ‘managing’ and ‘leading’, you can do so by adding up all the scores 
you gave yourself for those attributes in Column A and the scores you gave yourself for those attributes 
listed in Column B. The attributes listed in Column A are typically management orientation and the attrib-
utes listed in Column B are typically leadership orientation.
There is no one universal mixture of management + leadership behaviour. It will depend on the situ-
ation and the people involved. But we all have natural preferences that could lead us to a particular 
approach to a given situation regardless of the circumstances.
Key questions
1.	 What did you score?
2.	 How might you need to change your management + leadership mix to match a particular situation?

Ability Generally defined as a stable characteristic of a 
person’s capacity for physical or mental performance.
Accountability The ultimate responsibility that managers 
cannot delegate. While managers may delegate authority, 
they remain accountable for the decisions and actions of 
their subordinates.
Action-centred leadership A theory of leadership that 
focuses on what leaders do. It states that the effectiveness 
of a leader is dependent upon meeting three areas of need 
within the work group: the need to achieve the common 
task, the need for team maintenance and the individual 
needs of group members.
Action learning An approach to management 
development that involves a small self-selecting team 
undertaking a practical, real-life and organisational-based 
project. The emphasis is on learning by doing with advice 
and support from tutors and other course members.
Adhocracy A flexible, loosely structured, adaptable, 
organic and informal form of organisation.
Adjourning The adjourning or disbanding of a group 
because of, for example, completion of a task, or members 
leaving the organisation or moving to other tasks.
Adoption phase A range of choices relating to the 
introduction of new technology into organisations 
consisting of initiation, progression/feasibility, investment 
decision, and planning and systems design.
Agenda-setting A constant activity of managers involving 
a set of items, or series of agendas, relating to aims and 
objectives, plans, strategies, ideas, decisions to be made and 
priorities of action in order to bring about desired end results.
Aggression A physical or verbal attack on some person or 
object.
Alienation Refers to the detachment of the person from 
their work.
Alienative involvement Where members are involved 
against their wishes. There is a strong negative orientation 
towards the organisation.
Anthropology The study of the cultural system, that 
is human behaviour as a whole and the science of 
humankind.
Attitudes Can be defined as providing a state of ‘readiness’ 
or tendency to respond in a particular way. They are 
learned through life and are embodied within our 
socialisation process.
Attribution theory The way in which individuals make 
sense of other people’s behaviour through attributing 
characteristics to them by judging their behaviour and 
intentions on past knowledge and in comparison with 
other people they know.
Authoritarian (autocratic) style of leadership Where the 
focus of power is with the manager. The manager alone 
exercises decision-making and authority for determining 
policy, procedures and the allocation of work, and has 
control of rewards or punishments.
Authority The right of subordinates to take action or make 
decisions that the manager would otherwise have done.
Away days An approach to management development 
that uses activity-based exercises undertaken away from 
the workplace. The main objective is often building team 
spirit and working relationships.
Baby-boomers A generation and age group at work 
born between 1946 and 1963 and typified by a search for 
security.
Balanced scorecard An attempt to combine a range 
of both qualitative and quantitative measures of 
performance that recognise the expectations of various 
stakeholders.
Behaviourism A school of psychology developed out of 
research studies into learning that is interested in the study 
of behaviour and those actions that could be observed, 
measured and controlled.
Brainstorming (thought showers) Where a group adopts 
a ‘freewheeling’ attitude aimed at generating as many 
ideas as possible. The focus is on freedom of expression 
and the quantity of ideas rather than quality.
Bureaucracy A form of structure found in many large-scale 
organisations. Bureaucracy is based on specialisation of 
tasks, hierarchy of authority and decision-making, systems 
of rules and regulations and an impersonal orientation 
from officials.
Glossary

617
Glossary
Bureaucratic organisations Authority is based on the 
acceptance of the law of formal rules and procedures, and 
on impersonal principles.
Bureaucratic orientation An individual’s orientation to work 
in which he or she regards it as a central life issue. There is a 
sense of obligation to the work of the organisation.
Calculative involvement Where attachment to the 
organisation is motivated by extrinsic rewards.
Chain of command The number of different levels in the 
structure of the organisation; the chain of hierarchical 
command.
Charismatic organisation An organisation in which 
authority is legitimised by belief in the personal qualities 
of the leader and the leader’s strength of personality and 
inspiration.
Classical approach The organisation is thought of in terms of 
its purpose and formal structure and this approach aims to 
identify how methods of working can improve productivity. 
Emphasis is placed on the planning of work, the technical 
requirements of the organisation, principles of management 
and the assumption of rational and logical behaviour.
Classical conditioning A theory on learning developed by 
Pavlov, using dogs. Pavlov found that instinctive reflexes 
could be ‘conditioned’ to respond to a new situation and 
new stimulus.
Coaching A supportive relationship aimed at creating 
understanding, direction and action. Coaching uses 
deductive techniques and the coach does not have to be 
an expert in the subject.
Coercive power Based on fear and the subordinate’s 
perception that the leader has the ability to punish or bring 
about undesirable outcomes for those who do not comply 
with the directives (e.g. withholding promotion or privileges). 
Cognitive theories of learning Theories of learning that 
identify how and why people learn, taking individual 
factors into consideration, and not simply the behaviour 
demonstrated through the learning process.
Community level The level within an organisation that 
is concerned with broad objectives and the work of the 
organisation as a whole.
Conceptual ability The ability to view the complexities of 
the operations of the organisation as a whole, including 
environmental influences, and the ability to make decisions.
Concertive control A system of control not exercised by 
managers but by the value consensus of the team to a 
system of normative rules.
Conflict Present where there is an incompatibility of goals 
arising from opposing behaviours at the individual, group 
or organisational level. Particularly, conflict is behaviour 
intended to obstruct the achievement of some other 
person’s goals.
Constructive behaviour A positive reaction to the 
blockage of a desired goal through problem-solving or 
compromise.
Content theories of motivation These theories attempt 
to explain those specific things that actually motivate the 
individual at work and are concerned with identifying 
people’s needs, the strength of those needs and the goals 
they pursue in order to satisfy those needs.
Contingency approach An extension of the systems 
approach to management that implies that the structure 
of an organisation and its success are dependent upon 
the nature of tasks that are undertaken and the nature of 
environmental influences. There is, therefore, no one best 
way to structure or manage organisations; rather, it must 
be dependent upon the contingencies of the situation.
Continuing professional development (CPD) The process 
of planned, continuing development of individuals 
throughout their career.
Control By their very nature control systems are 
concerned with regulation of behaviour and improvement 
in performance. Control is not only a function of formal 
organisation but also organisational behaviour and 
interpersonal influence.
Corporate social responsibility This concept gives rise to 
how a company should conduct itself within society, and 
different views on what a business is for and how it should 
act. Social responsibilities arise from the interdependence 
of organisations, society and the environment.
Corporate strategy This formalises the objectives and 
policy of an organisation and serves to describe its sense 
of purpose together with its direction and scope over the 
long term.
Creativity The application of imaginative thought, which 
may lead to new ways of seeing things, and results in 
innovative solutions to a problem or the initiation of 
change.
Decentralisation Where specific delegation is given to 
sub-units or groups within an organisation such that they 
enjoy a measure of autonomy or independence.

emphasis is on the clarification of goals and objectives, 
work tasks and outcomes, and organisational rewards and 
punishment.
Transformational change Involves a fundamental shift in 
the culture, conduct of business and working practices of 
an organisation, and often enacted over a period of time.
Transformational (or creative) leadership Based on the 
objective of transforming the performance or fortunes of 
a business. The emphasis is on generating a vision for the 
organisation and the leader’s ability to appeal to the values 
of followers in attempting to create a feeling of justice, 
loyalty and trust.
Type A personality Individuals who thrive on hard work 
and long hours, and exhibit characteristics such as a 
high need for achievement, extreme competitiveness, 
impatience and aggressiveness. Type A personalities are 
more vulnerable to heart attacks.
Type B personality Individuals who exhibit the opposite 
characteristics from Type A and who are less vulnerable to 
heart attacks.
Ultimatum game An economic behavioural game that can 
arguably be related to the concept of equity theory.
Unconscious bias Our preferred people preferences. The 
subtle, unconscious behaviours that are hard-wired into us 
and difficult to eliminate altogether.
Unitarist perspective Where a work organisation is viewed 
as an integrated and harmonious whole, with managers 
and other staff sharing common interests and objectives.
Virtual teams Teams where the primary interaction 
among members is by some electronic information and 
communication process.
