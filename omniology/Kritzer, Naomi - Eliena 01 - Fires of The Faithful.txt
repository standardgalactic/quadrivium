Fires of the Faithful 
 
 
For sixteen-year-old Eliana, life at her conservatory of music is a pleasant 
interlude between youth and adulthood, with the hope of a prestigious 
Imperial Court appointment at the end. But beyond the conservatory walls 
is a land blighted by war and inexplicable famine and dominated by a 
fearsome religious order known as the Fedeli, who are systematically 
stamping out all traces of the land’s old beliefs. Soon not even the 
conservatory walls can hold out reality. When one classmate is brutally 
killed by the Fedeli for clinging to the forbidden ways and another is 
kidnapped by the Circle—the mysterious and powerful mages who rule the 
land—Eliana can take no more. Especially not after she learns one of the 
Circle’s most closely guarded secrets.
Now, determined to escape the Circle’s power, burning with rage at the 
Fedeli, and drawn herself to the beliefs of the Old Way, Eliana embarks on 
a treacherous journey to spread the truth. And what she finds shakes her 
to her core: a past destroyed, a future in doubt, and a desperate people in 
need of a leader—no matter how young or inexperienced....

Witchlight flared, blindingly bright. I leaped back, but hands seized my 
arms and jerked me inside. The door slammed shut behind me. I blinked 
in the dazzling light, staring into the rigid face of the man who had 
grabbed my arms. He wore the uniform of the Circle Guard. Beyond him, I 
could see four more men in the same uniform, seated on the beds, 
crossbows leveled.
At the very end of my bed sat an older man in a scarlet robe, with chill 
yellow eyes. He rose, his lips tight. “It’s the roommate,” he said. “Bring her 
here.” He indicated the floor directly in front of him.
“Sit,” the guard said, shoving me toward the man in scarlet. “And be 
silent.”
My knees shaking, I sank to the floor. I could hear my heart pounding. 
With a flick, the man in scarlet dispelled the witchlight and sat back down. 
We waited in silence, staring at the door in the fading daylight.
They had to be here for Mira. But why?
I could hear the man in scarlet behind me, his breathing calm and even—
like this was something he did every day. I had looked at him only for an 
instant, but his yellow eyes were burned into my mind. I shuddered, and 
felt his hand close over my shoulder like a claw.
We heard footsteps approaching the door. I felt a gloved hand cup my

throat. My stomach lurched with the desire to escape, but I bit my lip and 
remained still. I could hear the soldiers tense, then rise. The door started 
to swing open.
“Run!” I screamed to Mira. “Run!”

Acknowledgments 
 
 
First I’d like to thank my editor, Anne Groell, my agent, James Frenkel, 
and his assistant, Tracy Berg, for their help, support, and enthusiasm.
I’d like to thank the members of the Wyrdsmiths, past and present, for 
critique, encouragement, and friendship: Bill Henry, Doug Hulick, Ralph 
A. N. Krantz, Harry LeBlanc, Kate Leith, Kelly McCullough, Lyda 
Morehouse, and Rosalind Nelson. Very special thanks to Lyda, who, when 
I told her that I wanted to write a novel but was afraid that I’d write myself 
into a corner, simply said, “You won’t.” Two days later, I started writing 
Fires of the Faithful.
Quite a few people answered questions, helped me with research, or let me 
borrow ideas. Thanks to all of them, but special thanks to Michelle Herder, 
for historical information; Curtis Mitchell, for letting me borrow some 
ideas on marriage customs; Geriann Brower for Italian language 
consultation; and Sharon Albert and Louis Newman for Aramaic language 
consultation. Of course, any linguistic mistakes or historical anachronisms 
should be blamed on me, and not my consultants.
Thank you to all of my beta readers, who read and commented on earlier 
versions of this book: Ed Burke, Jason Goodman, Rick Gore, Michelle 
Herder, Jennifer Horn, Curtis Mitchell, Rudy Moore, Rebecca Murray, and 
John Savage.

My most heartfelt thanks go to several people. To my parents, Bert and 
Amy Kritzer, who encouraged my writing and creativity, and my love of 
reading, pretty much from birth onward; my sister, Abi, and brother, Nate, 
for being my very first fans; and my wonderful husband, Ed Burke, who 
has an unerring sense for when I need to be nagged, when I need to be 
reassured, and when I need two pints of premium ice cream.
Finally, when I was a very young novice writer, my neighbor Nancy 
Vedder-Shults offered to critique one of my first completed stories. Her 
comments were both incisive and supportive, and gave me the tools I 
needed to begin to edit my writing; her encouragement since then has 
been unfailing. Every young writer should have a mentor as insightful and 
kind as Nancy.

CHAPTER ONE
contents - next 
 
 
For God so loved Her only son,  
She redeemed the world. 
 
—The Journey of Gèsu, chapter 4, verse 19. 
 
 
Mira arrived at the Verdiano Rural Conservatory for the Study of Music 
the same week that the song did. In retrospect, if either Mira or the song 
had appeared alone, I might have understood things sooner. But I was 
distracted from the song by my new roommate, and distracted from Mira 
by the puzzle of the song, and I didn’t learn the truth about either one until 
it was too late to do anything but try to contain the damage.
When I heard that the conservatory had taken on a new student—a sixteen-
year-old girl—I knew she’d be placed with me. My old roommate, Lia, had 
left Verdia with her family months ago, tired of famine and war. I’d gotten 
rather accustomed to the extra space, and the Dean would be pleased to 
remind me that it wasn’t really mine. Sure enough, I returned after 
ensemble practice to find the stranger in my room, her meager possessions 
strewn over the bed I’d reluctantly cleared for her. She had her back to me, 
and as I paused in the doorway before saying hello, I realized that she was

trying to light a candle with flint and steel by striking them over the wick.
“You’re never going to get it lit that way,” I said. I startled her more than I 
meant to; the flint and steel skittered across the stone floor and she 
whirled around to face me. I held out my hands, one empty, the other 
holding my violin case. “I assume you’re my new roommate,” I said. “My 
name is Eliana.”
Her eyes flicked past my shoulder, just for an instant, looking to see if 
there was anyone behind me. Then she looked me over—her gray eyes 
taking in my short hair, square jaw, shapeless gray robe. I’m very tall for a 
woman— almost as tall as most men. I’d heard that the boys called me 
stuck-up; I knew that many people at the conservatory found me a little 
intimidating. As my new roommate sized me up, I had the eerie sense that 
she . . . approved.
“My name is Mira,” she said, and gave me brief flash of a smile. “I’m 
pleased to meet you.” She ducked to pick up the flint and steel.
I hung up my cloak and put away my violin. There was a violin case on 
Mira’s bed as well, tightly buckled and dusty from the road. “You play 
violin?” I asked.
“Yes,” she said.
I hoped she was decent with her instrument; sharing a room at a 
conservatory with a bad musician could be almost unbearable.
Having retrieved the flint and steel, Mira held them out to me. “Please, 
would you show me how to use these?”
I took the flint and steel out of her hands and set them on her bed, then 
scraped some lint off my robes. “You need something that lights easily to

catch the spark. These robes they make us wear must be good for 
something, right?” I glanced up and she smiled cooperatively. I put the lint 
in the cupped edge of the candle holder and lit it with a spark from the 
flint and steel, then lit the candle from the burning lint. “There you go.”
“Thank you,” Mira said, and set the candle in the windowsill. It would 
blow out in a minute or two. She really had no idea how to deal with a 
candle.
I studied Mira in the flickering light. She had some of the palest skin I’d 
ever seen—she couldn’t have come here from a farm. But she was well fed—
given the famine, she couldn’t have come from any town in Verdia. She 
was clearly my age, too old to be just starting at a conservatory, but her 
hair was freshly cut—she couldn’t have transferred from a conservatory in 
another province. But it was the candle that really had me puzzled.
I was always reasonably adept at magery, probably because playing the 
violin had honed my ability to concentrate. I couldn’t draw magefire down 
from the sky to melt stone, of course—I wasn’t Circle material—but I could 
light a hearth fire from damp wood with a moment’s effort, which 
impressed most people well enough. Still, even a child could kindle 
witchlight to light a dim room—or, if she didn’t want the distraction of 
keeping the witchlight glowing, she could light a candle with her cupped 
hand. Even my half-wit friend Giula could do that much. There were 
people who couldn’t use magery, but very few—and they would have 
already known how to light a candle the hard way. The only real reason I 
could think of that Mira might avoid using magery would be if she were 
trying to conceive a child. Using magic decreased fertility; that’s why my 
mother had taught me how to use flint and steel, even though childbearing

was the farthest thing from my mind at the conservatory. I wondered why 
Mira’s mother hadn’t taught her the same thing; maybe Mira’s mother was 
one of those women who had children whether she used magery or not.
The wind blew out the candle and I watched as Mira fumbled for a 
moment before she managed to get it lit again. I set it down on the table 
beside her bed.
“Where are you from?” I asked.
“Cuore,” Mira said. Then she hesitated for a moment and added, “Most 
recently.”
“Cuore?” Whatever answer I’d imagined, that wasn’t it. I tried to hide my 
surprise. “How are things up there? They say the famine is affecting 
everyone ...”
“Not Cuore.” A sardonic smile flashed across Mira’s face. “The home of the 
Circle, the Fedeli, and the Emperor will always stay well supplied.” She 
turned away to hang, up her cloak on a peg by the foot of her bed. “How 
are things here?”
“Not too bad, not at the conservatory. This part of Verdia didn’t see any 
fighting during the war; my friend Bella and I used to go up to the top of 
the bell tower to look at the countryside beyond Bascio, and we never saw 
so much as smoke, let alone magefire. Food was a little short during the 
war, but at least it grows here now. The famine areas are closer to the 
Vesuviano border, where the fighting was—we don’t waste much, but we 
don’t go hungry, either.”
Mira picked up her violin and moved it to her desk. “Is it true what I’ve 
heard?” she asked, her back to me. “About the seeds?”
“That the seeds die in the ground without even sprouting?” I sat down on

my own bed, staring at Mira’s back. “Yes. At least in the worst areas.”
“Where are you from?” Mira asked.
“Doratura,” I said. “It’s west of here, but nowhere near the famine areas. 
Don’t worry, my family is fine.”
“That’s good,” Mira said, turning toward me again and sitting down on her 
stool.
“There are others here who aren’t as fortunate,” I said. “My friend Bella, 
her family’s farm isn’t in the truly devastated area, but everything they 
plant grows stunted, and withers in a strong sun.”
Mira was silent, rubbing the edge of one sleeve with her fingers.
“If you are from Cuore ‘most recently,’ where were you from originally?” I 
asked.
“Tafano,” Mira said. “It’s a very small village south and west of here. I 
wouldn’t expect you to have heard of it.”
I blinked. “How did you end up in Cuore? And what are you doing back in 
Verdia?”
“I thought I had a calling.” Mira studied her hands. “My order was pretty 
obscure, and I had to go to Cuore to go to seminary.”
“You’re a priestess?” I said.
“No,” she said. “I was only ever an initiate. I didn’t get as far as the 
ordination, and now, obviously, I’m never going to.” She looked up to give 
me a rueful smile. “I decided I wanted to pursue my first love—music. I 
came here because, well, I was born in Verdia. I felt like I belonged here.”
I shook my head. Starting at a conservatory so late, she couldn’t possibly 
have been sponsored by the Circle with a scholarship—she had to be a

paying student. I was curious to know where she’d gotten the money, but it 
would have been too rude to ask. I wondered if she’d stolen it from her 
order; the Dean was unlikely to inquire too carefully regarding the source 
of any silver crossing his desk.
“Eliana!” There was a sharp rap at my door. “Are you in there?”
“Come in,” I called.
Giula flung the door open. “You were going to come meet me, weren’t you? 
To practice? Remember?”
“I’m sorry,” I said. I hadn’t forgotten; I’d just decided that Giula could 
wait. “Giula, this is my new roommate, Mira. Mira, this is Giula, one of the 
other violinists.”
“Oh!” Giula’s indignation melted; a newcomer was certainly excuse 
enough to be late to a practice session. “How nice to meet you.” She smiled 
at Mira, showing her dimples. “Where are you from?”
“Tafano,” Mira said.
“Tafano!” Giula actually seemed to recognize the name of the village. 
“Where ever did you get lovely pale skin like that in Tafano?”
“Well, most recently I lived in Cuore,” Mira said.
Giula’s eyes bugged out.
I grabbed Giula’s arm. “Did you want to practice, or not?” I asked. Giula 
shot me a venomous glare, but let me drag her off. “It’s not like she’s going 
anywhere,” I said once the door was closed. “You can interrogate her later.”
Giula was cheerful again by the time we’d reached the practice hall. “So 
that’s your new roommate! Not quite so bad as you made it sound at 
lunch, is it?”

“I still say there are enough empty rooms that I shouldn’t have to have a 
roommate if I don’t want one,” I said. Giula shrugged unsympathetically. 
In the practice room, Giula and I set our music on the stand. We would 
play a duet in the autumn recital the following week; I was a better 
violinist than Giula, but we shared a teacher, Domenico, and he had 
instructed us to play together. She would take the easier part.
“Did she tell you why she came here from Cuore?” Giula asked, still 
incredulous.
“She was in Cuore preparing for ordination,” I said.
“She was going to be a priestess? But why would she ever come back here?”
“You can ask her later, can’t you?” I flipped open the music to the duet. 
“Are we going to practice or not?”
Giula tightened her bow and started tuning her violin, still talking. “And 
why would she be starting at this time of year? Auditions were in the 
spring. Though she couldn’t have auditioned anyway—she’s our age, or 
maybe even older. She has to be a paying student. But why would you pay 
to come here?”
I rolled my eyes and tucked my violin under my chin.
“Maybe her family lives near here,” Giula said.
“Maybe.” Students who left the conservatory, even for a day, lost their 
scholarships and could not return. We assumed it was to discourage all but 
the most dedicated from pursuing a life as a musician. But our families 
could come and visit us, which was a possibility if they lived close by. Lia’s 
family had visited once. “We need to work on this duet,” I said. At least 
Giula needed to work on it, because if she didn’t sound at least decent at

the recital, nobody would notice my playing at all.
Giula reluctantly tucked her violin under her chin. “Why do you suppose 
she’s so pale?”
“Presumably she spent most of her time indoors at her seminary,” I said. 
Giula started to lower her violin again, and I tapped the music pointedly. 
“Let’s take it from the top.”
I counted out a beat and started to play. Giula picked up her part in the 
third measure, and stumbled almost immediately.
“Again,” I said. “Start here.”
“Wait,” Giula said.
For a moment, I thought Giula was going to start gossiping again, but her 
head was tilted to the side, and after a beat I realized that she was listening 
to the musician in the next practice room. The musician was Celia, one of 
the sopranos; I recognized her voice. But she wasn’t practicing anything 
I’d heard before, and since Celia was at least nominally a friend of mine, I 
was familiar with most of her repertoire.
 
 
I’ve come to wed your father but I want to make you mine.
If you’ll take me as your mother, you will find my faults are few.
I’ve brought a gift of honey, bright as sun and sweet as wine.
And as pure as all the love I hold inside my heart for you.
 
 
Celia paused, and Giula looked up at me, her eyes wide. “Everyone’s 
file:///C|/Downloads/Kritzer,%20Naomi%20-%20Eliana%...Eliana%2001]%20-%20Fires%20of%20the%20Faithful.html (20 of 400)08/02/2006 11:47:46

talking about this song. I hadn’t heard it sung yet.”
Celia began to sing the verses. Six children tasted the honey and embraced 
their stepmother. Then the seventh son rejected the honey, and was 
murdered by his own father for his insolence. Then one by one the other 
six children died, poisoned by the lethal gift. In the end, the father wept 
over the graves of his children, but was at the mercy of his new wife and 
his two stepchildren. In the final verse, the bones of the dead children 
cried out for vengeance; apparently this was left up to the listener.
There was a knock on the door of our practice room. I opened the door; it 
was Bella, her trumpet in her hand. “Did you hear Celia?” she asked.
I sighed. “I gather we aren’t the only students here who aren’t rehearsing.”
Bella waved her hand—not the one with the trumpet—dismissively. “I 
think I saw the person who brought the song.”
“Really?” Giula set her violin down altogether. I resigned myself to the 
inevitable and put mine down as well.
Bella sat down on one of the practice stools, and Giula and I did as well. “I 
was watching down the hill for the messenger wagon, and I saw someone 
ride into town. I don’t know horses that well, but it looked like a fast riding 
horse—not the sort of horse you’d hitch to a plow. The rider was wearing a 
cloak pulled over his face—” Bella gestured with the floppy sleeve of her 
robe.
“It’s been a chilly autumn,” I said. “Of course he wanted to protect his 
face.”
Bella rolled her eyes. “I saw him dismount by the cottage where your 
teacher lives—Domenico. He was inside for less than an hour, and then he

rode away.”
“Did you see his face?” Giula asked.
“It would have been too far even if his face hadn’t been covered,” Bella 
said. “You should try asking Domenico about it.” She shot a glance directly 
at me. Domenico would never gossip to Giula—not when she was so busy 
flirting with him—but he might talk to me. I nodded a little. It was worth a 
try.
“What do you think the song’s about?” Giula asked.
“It’s probably some stupid noble’s feud,” Bella said. “Some branch of the 
family got killed by treachery and now they want the whole world to help 
them get revenge.”
“Wouldn’t it help if the offending family were named?” I asked.
“People might not spread the song if they knew it was some petty feud,” 
Bella said.
“They would if it was a good enough tune.”
“So what’s your theory?” Bella asked.
“I don’t know. I don’t think the poisoned honey refers to literal honey, 
though. I think it’s some sort of disguised danger, but it’s disguised awfully 
well. I don’t have any idea what it’s talking about.”
Giula didn’t even venture a guess. “I wish it had been the messenger 
service, instead of a man with a mysterious song,” she said.
“Honestly, so do I.” For a moment, Bella’s face looked worn. “The news 
from my family last time wasn’t good.” The news next time was unlikely to 
be better, but anything was preferable to uncertainty. And perhaps the 
harvest would be better than expected, if only by a little.

The supper bell rang, and we quickly packed up our instruments to walk 
over to the girls’ meal hall. I had expected Mira to join us for supper, but 
she wasn’t there. Celia was, though, repeating the words of the honey song 
to those who hadn’t heard them yet. Giorgi, the cook’s assistant, brought 
out heavy tureens of stew made from the vegetables we grew in the 
conservatory garden, and jugs of tea and wine.
Celia flicked back a curl that had fallen into her face and took a sip of her 
tea. Celia didn’t like tying her hair back, probably because the curls framed 
her heart-shaped face so charmingly. Not that any of us were supposed to 
be trying to attract the attention of the boys, but Celia liked any attention 
she could get. “It’s a lovely song,” she said, “but I think it’s just about some 
feud. Some noble family sent a bride to another family with poisoned 
honey. Their children ate it and died. Maybe there was a son who refused 
to eat it, but—”
This wasn’t far off from Bella’s theory, but her eyes narrowed. “Oh, come 
on, Celia,” she said. “You don’t really think the song is about literal honey, 
do you?”
Celia arched one perfect eyebrow. “Why don’t you share your theory with 
us, Bella?” she said.
“Eliana thinks the poisoned honey is a symbol for some disguised danger,” 
Bella said. “I think she’s right, but I don’t know what the danger is.”
Flavia, a percussionist, looked up from her stew. “I think you’re right 
about the symbolism,” she said. “It’s a ballad rhythm, or I’d say that the 
Fedeli wrote the song.”
“The Fedeli.” I put down my tea. “Why the Fedeli?”

kind?” Flavia said. “I could easily see the song reaching us well before we 
actually heard what heresy it was supposed to be about.”
We considered that idea for a moment.
“But, like I said, the rhythm’s not right. I would expect the Fedeli to write 
something that sounded like a hymn— not like something that sounds like 
a folk ballad.” Flavia took a sip of wine.
“Eliana got a new roommate today,” Giula said. “From Cuore.”
That diverted the conversation entirely, and after checking to make sure 
that she wasn’t standing behind me, I described Mira to the others and 
told what little I knew about her: born in Tafano, trained at a seminary in 
Cuore, and ignorant in the use of candles.
“Do you suppose . . .” Bella said.
“Why would you come all the way to the conservatory from Cuore if you 
were going to try to get pregnant?” I asked. Any pregnant girl student—
and any boy student who was named as the father—was expelled from the 
conservatory. Clearly, if the Lady blessed your union, she wanted you to 
get married and settle down, not go off to join an ensemble.
“Maybe she’s in love with one of the boy students,” Giula said.
“How would she have met him?” I asked. We were kept well separated 
from the boys at the conservatory. The only place we were even allowed in 
the same room with them was the chapel. This encouraged a high degree 
of religious observance among girls like Celia.
“That can’t be it,” Bella said. “Maybe she had a lover in Cuore, and she 
hopes she’s pregnant by him.”
“Why would she have left, then?” Giula asked.

“That’s obvious,” Bella said. “She was an initiate, wasn’t she? Maybe the 
boy wasn’t.”
“Still,” I said. “Why would she leave Cuore?”
“Maybe ...” Bella closed her eyes and rubbed her forehead. “This is getting 
too complicated. Even if the relationship ended badly, if she has any 
reason to think she’s pregnant, then coming back to Verdia would just be 
stupid.”
Celia tossed her hair back. “Clearly, you’ve never been in love.”
Bella’s eyes narrowed and she smiled slowly at Celia, letting Celia’s words 
hang in the air as a pink flush crept slowly upward from the gray wool 
collar of Celia’s robe. “If I risk being expelled from the conservatory,” Bella 
said, “I want it to be for a man—not a boy. But to each her own.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Celia said.
Bella had started to turn back to her tea, but when Celia got defensive, she 
took that as an invitation to twist the knife a little more. “Why would it 
mean anything?” she asked. “I think your devotion to the Lady is very 
touching, Celia.”
Celia went white. Naturally, she attended chapel daily to flirt with the boys 
there, but Bella meant something else, and Celia knew it. Magery was the 
Lady’s gift to humanity, but it decreased fertility. To counteract this 
tendency, the Lady encouraged Her children to try to make children of 
their own as frequently as possible. Of course, the Lady didn’t want 
conservatory students having babies—our celibacy, like the sterility of the 
Circle, increased the fertility of everyone else. But, still. “Honoring the 
Lady” was a popular euphemism for the sort of thing that happened 
secretly on summer nights in the shadows of the practice halls—and that

occasionally resulted in expulsions.
“The Lady rewards those who love Her with their whole heart,” Celia said, 
her voice shaky and her face still white. “You should try attending Chapel 
sometime when it isn’t required, Bella. The results might surprise you.”
“Sure, Celia,” Bella said, and returned to her tea. Celia stood up to go, and 
Bella caught her by the dangling edge of her sleeve. “Just be careful,” she 
said. “You know what I mean.” She released Celia, clucking her tongue, 
and Celia flounced out.
I tried to imagine Mira with a lover, and shook my head. Mira lacked the 
coy flirtatiousness it took to catch a boy’s eye. She was like me—a little bit 
intimidating. Besides, if she’d stopped using magery that long ago, why 
wouldn’t she have learned to light a candle by now?
Mira was not in the room when I returned from supper, but her cloak and 
violin were missing. She’d gone somewhere to practice, late though it was. 
She’d taken the candle. I slung my own violin over my shoulder and went 
out to see if I could find her. I was curious how well she could play, after 
all these years as a seminarian.
I listened carefully to the muffled cacophony in the corridor of the main 
practice hall. Two violins—but I recognized both. Not Giula, unfortunately
—she needed the practice, but was probably studying for our music theory 
class.
I left through the back door, and as I crossed the courtyard, I saw the 
flicker of candlelight in the north practice hall. Many students used 
candles rather than witchlight while they practiced, but none of us used 
the north practice hall. It was cold, first of all, and so drafty that small 
drifts of snow actually blew across the floor in winter. And the acoustics

were terrible. Bella once claimed it was haunted, though she was telling a 
ghost story to scare Giula and needed a creepy setting for it. In any case, 
the candle had to belong to Mira.
The front door of the north practice hall was ajar. I slipped in and paused 
in the shadow. Mira was playing in the ensemble hall rather than one of 
the side rooms; she had set her candle in a wall niche that protected it 
from drafts, but it still wavered, making her shadow dance on the wall. It 
occurred to me that sneaking around to spy on another student practicing 
was a little absurd, but I was curious about Mira. I put down my violin very 
quietly, sat with my cloak huddled around me, and listened.
Mira started off with very basic etudes—finger exercises. Her fingers were 
clumsy, and she missed many of the notes, which wasn’t surprising for 
someone who’d spent the last few years in a seminary rather than a 
conservatory. But as she warmed up and the fluidity began to come back to 
her, she began to make the etudes sound like something I hadn’t expected. 
She treated them as if they were music rather than a demonstration of 
technical skill; I realized, listening to her, that the world was slipping away 
around her, and nothing but each note existed. Her technique was raw, but 
the sound was beautiful. I wondered how she was able to bring herself to 
give this up, when she thought she had a calling—and if her calling was so 
powerful, how she had been able to give that up, now.
Then she finished with her exercises and began to play a melody—and I 
froze.
There were a few songs once used in old village ceremonies that still 
circulated at the conservatory. Playing ritual music from the Old Way was 
illegal, of course. And it would have been dangerous in a city conservatory,

because of the Sudditi Fedeli della Signora, the Faithful Subjects of the 
Lady. But the Fedeli avoided backwater areas like Verdia, and most 
everyone shrugged off the danger. I certainly did. I knew a wedding song 
and a healing song, and I played them regularly. The Old Way music had 
an undercurrent that more recent music completely lacked. Most Old Way 
songs were in a minor key, but they were fast, with rhythms that felt like 
the heartbeat of the earth underneath me, and they stirred my blood like 
strong wine and cold wind.
I had never heard the song Mira was playing, but I recognized it as Old 
Way music from the peculiar rhythm: da dat da da dat da wham wham 
wham. Da dat da da dat da wham wham wham. Listening intently, I 
could see Mira throw her head back as she played, raising the violin like an 
offering, and I thought, she was studying to be a priestess?
Mira played the song through twice, picking up the tempo as she played. A 
cold draft touched my feet where I sat, and I curled my toes up inside my 
boots, clenching and flexing my hands. Then, midphrase, Mira stopped. 
She set her violin down carefully on the floor, and straightened for a 
moment, looking at the candle. Then she bent over and vomited on the 
floor, and vomited again, and then fell to her knees, still retching. I 
jumped to my feet. “Mira!”
She should have been startled by my presence, but she didn’t even look up. 
When I reached her, she was curled up on the cold stone floor, clenching 
her fists and wrapping her arms around herself. “I’ll get the physician,” I 
said.
“No,” she gasped, and grabbed the edge of my robe in her fist. “No, it won’t 
do any good. Stay here. Don’t leave me. This will pass. It will pass.”

I didn’t believe her, but I was afraid she might be dying, and she might die 
alone if I left her. So I dragged her away from her vomit on the floor, then 
covered her with her cloak and sat down beside her. She was shaking 
harder than I’d ever seen anyone shake from cold. After a moment I 
covered her with my own cloak, as well.
“I’ll be fine,” she said, between spasms of shaking. “Don’t worry about me.”
“Lady’s tits, Mira,” I said. “Let me get the physician. Or Giorgi, the cook’s 
assistant—he’s the village healer.”
“No,” she said. “I just want you. Stay with me. Please, don’t leave me.”
“But I don’t know anything about healing,” I said. I touched her forehead 
with the back of my hand to test for fever, but it was cool, even chill.
“I don’t need healing,” she said. “Talk to me.”
“What do you want me to talk about?” I asked.
“Anything,” she said. “Just let me hear your voice, so I know I’m not alone.”
So I talked. I told her about my family—about my favorite brother, the 
second-oldest, Donato, who taught me to fight and used to make me clay 
whistles. I told her about my friends at the conservatory—Giula and Bella 
and Flavia and Celia. I told her about the song that had arrived so 
mysteriously, about poisoned honey and dead children. I told her about 
my teacher, Domenico, how he was one of the handful of great teachers 
still left at the conservatory. Domenico had been educated at the Central 
Conservatory in Cuore and had actually spent several years playing at the 
Imperial Court before he gave it all up to come live in Verdia and teach at 
our conservatory. No one really knew why. Domenico told me he’d hated 
court, and from his descriptions of it I could understand why, though I still 
dreamed of playing there myself.

Mira shuddered, but this time she didn’t stop. Her eyes rolled back in her 
head, and she shook as if invisible hands grasped her shoulders and 
wrenched her back and forth. I had seen one other person have a 
convulsion—one of my nieces, when she was a baby and had a high fever. 
My mother had poured cold water over her and she’d lived. But Mira had 
no fever; her skin was as cold as the stones underneath us. I grabbed her 
and tried to hold her still, but her jerks pulled her out of my grasp. Then a 
moment later it was over, and she lay still. I held my hand lightly over her 
lips; she was still breathing. I sat back silently, clasping her limp hand. 
Mira’s hand was like carved marble—cold and impossibly smooth. I 
rubbed her palm with my thumb and suddenly my own blood turned cold. 
Mira had no calluses on her hands—not even the sort she’d have had from 
light garden work.
One of my brothers had trained for the priesthood for a while. He’d given 
it up after falling in love with a girl in the village, but I clearly remembered 
his complaints to our mother about the work. The elder priests and 
priestesses talked a lot about communing with the Lord and the Lady 
through reaping their bounty, but my brother thought that was just an 
excuse to stick the novitiates with all the heavy farm chores. I’d grown up 
on a farm and my brother was no stranger to hard work, but after a year at 
the seminary his calluses were thicker than my father’s.
I touched Mira’s soft hand again. She had never been an initiate priestess. 
That whole story was a lie.
Why would she make up a story like that?
I lit a globe of witchlight to get a closer look, and Mira threw her free hand 
over her face with a groan. “Hurts my eyes,” she muttered. “Put it away.”

I dispelled the witchlight with a flick of my wrist. Mira drew her hand away 
slowly.
“Play for me,” she said.
Her violin was in reach and in tune, while mine wasn’t, so I picked hers up.
“Play the funeral song,” she said. “The song I was playing earlier. I know 
you were listening.”
So it had been a funeral song. I added that mentally to my repertoire and 
began to play. I have always been able to pick out tunes quite easily, and I 
experimented a little as I played, adding a forceful downstroke to the 
strong beats and pairing them with the same note an octave up. Domenico 
had told me to hold still while I played, but Old Way songs always made 
me want to use my whole body, and I swayed back and forth with the 
music. I closed my eyes, watching the flicker of the candle against my 
eyelids. Then I opened my eyes.
For the first crazy instant, I thought a third person had silently entered the 
north practice hall, dressed in the uniform of a soldier. Then I thought I 
recognized my own face around the dark, riveting eyes. I started to my 
feet, and then realized that all I was looking at was a crumbling fresco. 
This was one of the oldest buildings at the conservatory, and had once 
been lavishly decorated.
I forced out a laugh. “I’ve been listening to too many of Bella’s ghost 
stories,” I said. Mira was silent. Slowly, I sat back down on the stone floor, 
more shaken than I thought I had any call to be. “The candlelight is 
making me jumpy.”
I set down Mira’s violin and took her soft hand again just as the candle

went out.
I stayed beside her through the night, talking when she roused enough to 
ask to hear my voice. Mira seemed to waver from consciousness to 
unconsciousness like a sputtering flame, but when she woke she seemed 
glad to have me there. In the last part of the night, her tremors calmed, 
and I asked if she’d like me to help her back to the room, where she might 
be more comfortable. She sat up, still shaking a bit. “Thank you,” she said. 
“I’d appreciate that.”
I packed up her violin and slung both hers and mine over my shoulder, 
then wrapped her cloak around her shoulders and slipped my arm under 
hers. If anyone was out and about at that hour, they were on their own 
business and pretended not to see us; I helped Mira up the long staircase 
and into our empty room, then helped her sit down on the bed. Mira lay 
down and pulled her blanket over herself, closing her eyes. Her shaking 
had finally eased.
There was an hour or so before I’d have to get up, and I quietly slipped my 
boots off. As I hung Mira’s cloak up, something fluttered to the floor. I 
picked it up and kindled a tiny witchlight, hoping that it wouldn’t disturb 
Mira; it was a letter of some kind. You stupid fools, it said. We don’t want 
your money. We want our daughter back. I flipped it over; it was signed, 
Isabella and Marino of Tafano, Verdia. I slipped the letter under a 
musical score on her desk, ashamed of myself for reading it.
“What?” Mira said, and I jumped, flicking away my witchlight and nearly 
scattering the papers again. In the darkness, I lay down on my own bed, 
curling up under my blanket.
“I’m leaving,” Mira said, her voice as clear as the bells we rang at the

Viaggio service.
“What?” I said, but Mira went on without heeding me, and I realized that 
she was talking in her sleep.
“You’re wrong, Liemo,” she said. Her voice was contemptuous. “I’ll break 
the chains you’ve bound me with. The Lady promises freedom and I’m 
going to take it. You can lock me up, you can even kill me, but you can’t 
make me serve you again.”
She was quiet after that, her breathing low and even. I lay awake, 
shivering. I told myself that I was still cold from the practice hall, but the 
fierce steel in Mira’s voice had cut me to the bone. I didn’t know whom she 
was speaking to, or what she was talking about, but I hoped I’d never find 
myself standing against her. In the end, I didn’t sleep at all that night. At 
dawn, Mira opened her eyes and looked over at me, giving me a slow smile 
that warmed me to my feet. “You will keep my secret?” she said. I didn’t 
even know what her secret was, but looking into her eyes, I would have 
done anything for her. “Yes,” I said. “Yes.”

“Ease up a bit on that first crescendo,” Domenico said. “And keep the 
tempo steady—you’re speeding up.” I nodded and flipped the music back a 
page to start again. “Incidentally, I heard you got a new roommate this 
week.”
I lowered my violin. “Yes,” I said. “Mira. She’s also a violinist.”
“Is she really from Cuore?” Domenico pulled his chair out from behind his 
desk and sat down. He gestured for me to pull up a chair, then gave me a 
sheepish look. “We really should be working on your part of the duet, but 
let’s face it; you’re far ahead of Giula at this point. If you aren’t note-
perfect on Viaggio, it won’t be because you didn’t practice.”
The Viaggio festival at the autumnal equinox celebrated the beginning of 
the Lord’s annual journey to fight and destroy the Maledori. Our autumn 
recital was held in the afternoon the day of the festival.
Domenico gave me an easy grin. “Tell me about your roommate,” he said.
“I think she really did live in Cuore,” I said, sitting down. I hesitated, 
debating whether I should tell my teacher that she was lying about being 
from a seminary, and decided against it. “She says she was at a seminary.”
Domenico shook his head, raking his fingers through his sand-colored 
hair. “That would explain why she’s literate, but not where she got the 
money. Are her parents wealthy?”
“They’re from a village in southwest Verdia,” I said. “I can’t imagine 
they’re that rich.”
“Maybe she had a rich friend from the seminary,” Domenico said. “Do you 
know why she left?”

“No, but I think she probably got in some sort of trouble. Bella was 
speculating last night that it involved a love affair, but I doubt that.” I 
paused. “You know, as far as I can tell, she doesn’t use magery.”
“Really?” Domenico looked up, startled and fascinated.
“Does that mean something?”
Domenico averted his eyes. “Well... probably not.”
He was hiding something from me; that was obvious. I couldn’t very well 
call him on it, so I folded my arms and waited silently.
“Have you made your list yet?” he asked. It was a lame attempt to change 
the subject. The Lord was known for handling the little things, the small 
requests that the Lady was too important to bother with. Making a list 
wasn’t part of official church rites, but since the Lord was leaving on His 
journey, everyone tried to get in requests before He left.
“Sure,” I said, continuing to glare at the floor.
Finally Domenico sighed and said, “Certain heresies hold that the use of 
magery is a sin.”
“You think she’s a heretic?” Trouble with the Fedeli would certainly 
explain Mira’s departure from Cuore. “Although, you know, she doesn’t 
know the first thing about getting by without magery, either. When I first 
saw her, she was trying to light a candle cold with flint and steel.”
“That wouldn’t be it, then,” Domenico said. “I’ve heard of musicians who 
stop using magery because they say their music is their gift from the Lady—
they want to use that power in their playing rather than to make lights to 
read by. That particular school of thought has been out of fashion for a few 
hundred years, but maybe Mira read something that mentioned the idea

and adopted it.”
“That fits,” I said. “Well, at least it fits better than anything else.”
Domenico nodded, still reflective. I leaned forward. “I heard you had a 
visitor yourself, this week.”
Domenico’s eyebrows shot up. “Who did you hear that from?”
“Bella saw someone on a horse stop in at your cottage,” I said. “She thinks 
he’s the man who brought the Wicked Stepmother song.”
“Bella was watching?” Domenico shook his head. “I shouldn’t tell you 
anything; you’ll only repeat it to that gaggle of goslings you call your 
friends.”
I shook my head. “Not if you’d rather I didn’t.”
“It hardly matters. I take my meals with Nolasco, Bella’s teacher, and I’m 
sure she’ll worm everything I’ve said out of him.” Domenico raked back his 
hair again. “Bella was right. That was the man who brought the song. It 
was a very young nobleman, handsomer than anyone has a right to be but 
with a manner that could curdle milk. He invited himself in, sang me the 
song enough times for me to learn it by heart, then went on his way. No 
explanation, not even an apology for interrupting my meal. He acted like 
he was doing me a favor by singing it for me.” Domenico shook his head. 
“But the song is a puzzle. I passed it on hoping that someone would be able 
to explain it to me, but so far no one has.” He leaned forward. “Have you 
and the goslings had any ideas?”
“Flavia thinks that the ‘poisoned honey’ is some sort of heresy, and that 
the song might have been written by the Fedeli,” I said.
“Interesting thought.”

“Celia thinks it’s literal—well, mostly literal. About some stupid feud 
between noble families. That was Bella’s theory, too, till Celia picked it up.”
“I’m dubious on that one. And not just because Celia likes it.”
“But with the young nobleman bringing the song—”
Domenico shook his head. “No. If it were a feud, they’d have hired 
professional musicians to spread it. The man who sang it for me could 
barely carry the tune.”
“Do you have a theory?” I asked.
Domenico shrugged. “Not yet,” he said.
* * *
Viaggio fell on a perfect autumn day, sunny and cool. It was a shame to 
waste most of the day indoors, but we were required to go to church in the 
morning. I refused to drag myself out of bed before dawn to primp for the 
boys, like Giula or Celia—but I did make sure I had a clean robe to wear as 
we’d be playing publicly that afternoon. As a fourth-year student, I was 
allowed to wear my hair long enough that I could pin it neatly back. Mira 
combed my hair for me, so that it could be parted straight. Her hands were 
gentle as she eased out the tangles; she focused as completely on my hair 
as she did on her music.
One sunny morning when I was eight years old, my mother had left the 
dishes unwashed after breakfast and had taken me down to a pond near 
our house where we could see our reflections in the water. She spent the 
morning teaching me how to braid hair, first hers, then my own—with four 
strands, or six, or so that the braid started at my temples. She braided her 
own hair so that it twisted in a dark wreath around the crown of her head. 
My hair was too short for that, but she let me braid and rebraid her hair

until it was perfect.
When Mira had finished with my hair, she pinned it back for me in my 
clasp. Then I combed Mira’s hair for her, though her hair was cropped so 
short that it hardly mattered. I spent more time on it than the job really 
justified, wishing that it was long enough for me to braid. Her hair was 
fine, and feathery soft. It curled just a little at the nape of her neck.
We filed into the chapel after breakfast, with most of the students vying for 
a spot near the center aisle that divided the boys from the girls. I sat by the 
far wall, next to Mira; Bella was in front of us. Despite the sun, the chapel 
was chill. I tucked my hands inside my sleeves. My brother, before he quit 
the seminary, spoke of the fire of devotion he felt inside. I never felt even 
enough fire from the church to warm my hands.
Once everyone was in place, Father Claro and Mother Emilia filed in with 
a few of the more devoted conservatory students acting as assistants. A 
cloud of rose-sweet incense smoke blew over me in a wave, and I stifled a 
sneeze. Mira stood with her head bowed, her eyes closed. The percussion 
instructor struck a large, deep drum twelve times, to dispel any Maledori 
that might be lingering near the doors, and we took our seats. I propped 
my chin on my fist, hoping that if I nodded off it wouldn’t be too 
noticeable. Father Claro insisted on chanting most of the service, which 
was always painful to hear; he was tone-deaf.
At the midpoint of the service, we rose again and picked up the bells and 
sheet music that had been set by our seats before the service started. This 
was by far my favorite part of the service; even if most of the church music 
was honey-sweet and ploddingly predictable, the after-echoes of the bells 
gave it a faint savor of the Old Way music. I checked the keys on my bells

and followed along with the music, Mother Emilia conducting. The sound 
of the bells hung in the air for a long time even when the song was done. 
Mira’s eyes were closed again and she had a faint smile on her face. Then 
we sat down and the service became boring again. Father Claro led a long 
prayer to the Lord and the Lady, and Mother Emilia preached an even 
longer sermon. Then was time for silent prayer and meditation; I closed 
my eyes and meditated on the piece I’d be playing in the recital later, 
running the notes through my head like a stream of water.
Finally the service was over. The meal before the recital was rushed and 
excited. Giula and Celia picked at their food; Bella attacked hers with 
single-minded concentration. I ate quickly and thoroughly, forcing myself 
to finish at least one full bowl of soup. I was thirsty, but drank only one 
cup of tea. Too much and I’d want to go to the privy during the concert.
The autumn and spring recitals were a big deal, even in a village as small 
as Bascio; the entire village attended. Signs were posted at the gate saying 
who would be playing, and where; I’d heard that there were villagers who 
specifically sought out my performances, though I didn’t believe it. Giula 
and I played immediately before one of the senior quartets, though, so I 
wasn’t surprised that the hall was filled.
As Giula and I stood up to play, Giula looked out at the audience and her 
eyes grew wide. “Lady’s tits,” she whispered. “I’ve forgotten how the duet 
goes.”
“Just close your eyes and don’t look at the audience,” I said. “You’ll 
remember when you hear the opening notes.” I looked out at the audience, 
searching for Mira. She was in the very back, but our eyes met and she 
gave me just a hint of her devastating smile.

Domenico nodded at us to start. Giula looked petrified, but tucked her 
violin under her chin when I lifted mine. The crowd grew silent.
I played the opening cascade of notes, hearing the audience let out its 
breath in a sigh. As I’d predicted, Giula remembered her part on cue, and 
even played through the full piece without stumbling. I could see Mira 
watching me, and I closed my eyes and poured my heart through the 
music. It finished far too quickly, and I ended my part with an improvised 
flourish that I realized too late I’d borrowed from the Old Way wedding 
music. Domenico’s eyes narrowed slightly, but I could see the hint of a 
smile on his face. I caught just a glimpse of Mira’s face again through the 
crowd, and she was giving me her quiet secret smile. The audience 
applauded with an enthusiasm that reassured me I’d done well, and Giula 
and I bowed. As we moved out of the way for the next performers, I looked 
back to see Mira again, to see if she knew that I’d been playing just for her.
Mira met my gaze immediately. She knew.

In the years before the war, the autumn concert was followed by a feast 
attended by students and faculty alike. Because the famine around us 
forbid that kind of waste, though, supper after the concert was now a 
simple, even haphazard affair, and Mira and I took our bread and soup 
and carried it down to the low conservatory wall to eat it. The wind had 
turned chill, and we both wrapped up in our cloaks, sitting on the wall and 
looking down at Bascio while we ate. Bascio was a hill town, the buildings 
clinging to the sides of the steep slope, the paths winding up to the top like 
gut around a tuning peg. The conservatory was at the very top of the hill, 
allowing us to see almost everything on our side of the hill.

In the cobbled streets of the town, the villagers were lighting bonfires to 
celebrate Viaggio, drinking wine and dancing. Like most of the festivals, 
Viaggio was believed to increase fertility, and many people took advantage 
of that. I vaguely remembered festivals that I’d celebrated in Doratura 
before I came here, but I was too young to participate so my parents gave 
me plenty of wine and then put me to bed.
“Thinking of home?” Mira asked.
“There’s only one Viaggio I really remember,” I said. “When I was nine 
years old, I knocked myself senseless the morning of the festival.” Mira 
gave me a startled look over her soup bowl. “My second-oldest brother, 
Donato, had given in to my wheedling and boosted me up to the lowest 
branch of the chestnut tree that grew outside our house, so that I could 
climb it. I fell out.” I dunked my bread into the broth and took a bite. 
“Donato felt just terrible, even though I was the one who’d pestered him to 
help me climb the tree. I didn’t tell our parents that he’d helped me climb, 
and Donato did all my chores until the headaches went away. Which took 
months, of course. A bad knock on the head hurts for an amazingly long 
time. Kind of funny, though, that that is what I remember—a bad knock on 
the head.” I scraped out the last of my soup bowl with the crust of the 
bread. “So what was Viaggio like in Cuore?”
Mira stared down at Bascio thoughtfully. “Bigger,” she said.
I waited for her to go on. “No other differences?” I asked, when she didn’t.
Mira set down her soup bowl. “There are other differences, of course.” She 
considered for a moment. “In the city, the Fedeli are always close by. You 
never know when they might be watching you, especially during a festival, 
when they can shed those black robes they usually wear. So in Cuore

things are a bit more—frenetic. It’s necessary, you see, not only to express 
your devotion toward the Lord and the Lady, but to make sure that the 
Fedeli, should they be watching, see that you do so.”
I had always daydreamed about landing a place in one of the Imperial 
ensembles, but right now that didn’t sound very appealing. Mira saw my 
smile fade and touched my hand. “Sorry to make you sad.”
“What do you want to do when you’re done at the conservatory?” I asked. 
“Do you want to go back to Cuore?”
“Not a chance,” she said. “I want to be a minstrel.”
I swung my head around to stare at her. “With a violin?” I asked. She 
shrugged. “You should take up lute. Minstrels have to sing.”
“Well, I suppose. I’ve been trying to work out a way to harmonize with the 
violin.”
I shook my head. “My old roommate, Lia, wanted to be a minstrel. But she 
was always a little eccentric. And she played lute.”
Mira shrugged again. “If that doesn’t work, I’ll come up with something 
else. But I’m never going back to Cuore. Not even if someone held a sword 
to my throat.” Her voice had taken on a bitter edge that made me feel cold 
and strange inside.
“What’s so horrible about it? Just the Fedeli?”
“There’s more to it than that, but—” She broke off and turned her eyes 
back toward the bonfires in the Bascio streets. “I don’t want to get into the 
dirty details of it. Maybe some other day.”
“I don’t know what to think of you, Mira,” I said. “I know you were never a 
seminarian.”

Mira didn’t look up. “I know that you know. Thank you for keeping my 
secret.”
“So what were you doing in Cuore? And why did you leave?”
“I can’t tell you,” Mira said. “Not now, not here.”
“Mira—” I said, and broke off. I didn’t know what to say. If not now, then 
when? If not here, then where? “Who’s Liemo?”
Mira’s eyes widened. “Where did you hear that name?”
“You spoke it in your sleep once.”
“He’s someone I knew in Cuore,” she said. “He’s not a nice man.”
“Is that all you’re going to tell me?” I asked.
“I’m afraid so,” Mira said.
“Mira, I don’t know what to think about you,” I said. “Your secrets—” 
Frighten me. I stared into Mira’s eyes. How can I trust you when it’s so 
clear that there are Maledori lurking just behind your shoulder?
Mira took my hand and pressed it gently between hers. They were still 
impossibly soft. “You stayed with me in my weakness,” she said. “You’ve 
kept my secrets. You are the truest friend I’ve ever had, so I’ll swear this to 
you: I will never lie to you again.” She released my hand. “I’ll give you my 
vow as my grandmother would have.” She picked up two twigs, held them 
in an X, and kissed them where they crossed. “I swear.”
Swearing in the Old Way—and on Viaggio, no less. For a girl who had just 
been talking about her fear of the Fedeli, Mira was a puzzle. “Do you want 
me to swear anything?” I asked.
“No,” she said. “I would never ask you to bind yourself to me.”
“What if I said I didn’t mind?” I reached out, tentatively, for Mira’s hand.

She let me lace my fingers with hers, and laid her free hand against my 
cheek.
“Listen,” Mira said after a moment. “You can hear the drums in the Bascio 
plaza.”
I closed my eyes. The drums were faint, like an echo of a heartbeat. Then 
they were lost in a gust of wind, but I could still hear my own heartbeat 
pounding in my ears.
“Eliana,” Mira said. “I’ve heard that almost all musicians, sooner or later, 
learn some of the Old Way songs. Do you know any?”
“Yes,” I said. “I know three. One is a song that was played at weddings, one 
is a song played for healing, and one—I heard you play.”
“That’s a funeral song,” Mira said. “Would you like to learn more?”
I felt excitement flare inside me like witchlight. “I would love to learn 
more,” I said. Since the music was illegal, it was never taught; I’d learned 
all three songs by eavesdropping. “How many do you know?”
“Lots,” Mira said. “Do you know of others who would like to learn? Who 
might be willing to play the songs, in a group?”
I pulled back for a moment. That would be far more dangerous than 
simply playing the songs individually, secretly.
But—“Yes,” I said. “Bella would. Flavia. Giula—I’ve heard her playing the 
wedding song. Celia, the vocalist—I think she would, too. It’s true that 
everyone learns them, even if they don’t talk about them.”
Mira nodded. “Can you ask them for me?” she asked. “You know them, I 
don’t.”
“Sure,” I said, thinking already about how best to approach each girl.

“Although—I know Bella will ask this, so promise me you aren’t here as a 
spy for the Fedeli, to uncover heretics?”
Mira’s eyes sparkled and her smile was warm. “No, of course not. I’m not 
here as a Fedele spy, and I’m happy to swear that for anyone who asks.” 
Mira leaped off the wall. “Dance with me,” she said. “Dance to the music 
from Bascio.”
So we clasped hands, and closed our eyes, and listened to the faint 
drumbeats from the village piazza, then lost ourselves in the crunch of the 
leaves under our feet, and the pounding of our hearts, and the wind in our 
ears.

I approached Bella, Flavia, Giula, and Celia about one week after Viaggio. I 
tackled each one individually, so that they wouldn’t talk each other out of 
the idea.
Bella raised one eyebrow when I asked her if she was interested. “Old Way 
music? What makes you think I know any?”
“I learned the wedding song from eavesdropping on you,” I said.
Bella’s eyes widened, then she gave me an easy grin. “Fair enough, Eliana. 
At least you’re as much of a heretic as I am. Tell me where to show up and 
when.”
Giula was a bit more difficult. “But we’re not supposed to play those,” she 
said.
“Right,” I said, rolling my eyes. “And nobody ever does. Kind of like 
nobody ever has a boyfriend, and nobody ever skips chapel services, and—”
“All right, all right,” she said. “But having a boyfriend can’t get you charged

with heresy.”
“When have the Fedeli even come to Verdia? You’re a lot more likely to be 
caught with a boyfriend, and you can be thrown out for that.”
Giula sighed sadly. “I’ve never actually had a boyfriend, Eliana.”
“You’ve wanted one, though. I’ve seen you vying for an aisle seat in the 
chapel.” I caught Giula’s arm. “You want to play this music, too. Give it a 
try.”
Celia gave me much the same argument that Giula did, except that she had 
actually had a boyfriend. “I’m not saying that I’ve lived a life of 
unblemished virtue,” Celia said, flushing. “But my sins have at least been 
small.‘”
“Are you telling me that you’ve never sung the Old Way music?”
“No, I’m not telling you that.” Celia turned even more red. “But I see the 
difference between playing it alone and playing in a group as sort of like—”
“Sort of like the difference,” I said, “between holding hands with a boy and 
meeting him at night behind the south practice hall for some—”
“I’ll be there,” Celia said hastily. “Tell me where.”
I had all sorts of arguments ready by the time I made it to Flavia’s room. 
Flavia listened to me carefully, then said, “I’ve been wishing for years I had 
the courage to do just this. Thank you—I’ll be there.”
Mira asked us to meet in the north practice hall. The weather had gotten 
colder in the last week, and no one used the north practice hall in winter if 
they could avoid it; it was even draftier than the chapel.
Giula walked over with me. “This was Mira’s idea?” she asked. “No wonder 
she didn’t fit in at the seminary.”

I laughed, but didn’t answer.
“Have you ever seen her use witchlight?”
“No. So far as I can tell, she doesn’t use magery of any kind.”
Giula looked speculative. “Do you suppose that she, you know, can’t?”
“It’s possible. There was a man in my village who couldn’t. He was simple, 
though.” I paused. “Domenico said that there used to be musicians who 
wouldn’t use magery—they believed that abstaining from magic made 
them better musicians.”
“Huh,” Giula said. “Well, is there anything to that? Have you heard her 
play?”
Thinking about Mira’s playing, I had to admit that there might be 
something to it. “Domenico said the theory’s been discredited. But Mira’s 
playing—” I shrugged. “Well, you’ll see.”
Mira had brought a large supply of candles, and lit them throughout the 
hall. Bella and Flavia were already there, but otherwise the hall was 
echoingly empty. Except for the night of Mira’s strange illness, I’d never 
spent much time in the north practice hall; now I walked around to take a 
good look. It was one of the oldest buildings at the conservatory and had 
not been well maintained, but I could see the remains of frescoes along the 
walls. One of those frescoes had frightened me half to death the night I sat 
with Mira. Now, in the daylight, it was hard to see why. Almost all the 
frescoes had been torn out or had crumbled away; the best-preserved one 
showed a man clutching a faint light to his breast. I assumed that it was a 
depiction of Gaius with the Lady’s Gift, but Gaius was generally depicted 
as looking triumphant rather than terrified.
Giula paced, her hands tucked into her sleeves and squeezed under her 
file:///C|/Downloads/Kritzer,%20Naomi%20-%20Eliana%...Eliana%2001]%20-%20Fires%20of%20the%20Faithful.html (47 of 400)08/02/2006 11:47:46

arms. I took out my violin and started tuning up. Mira, next to me, gave 
me a sudden flash of a smile, her gray eyes warming me.
“What are we going to play?” I asked Mira.
“I thought we’d play the prayer for healing,” Mira said.
“I don’t suppose you know a prayer for warm hands?” Giula asked.
Celia came in, peering curiously around the shadowed room.
“Everyone’s here,” Mira said. “Let’s start.”
I knew the tune for healing, as did Bella, but Celia, Giula, and Flavia did 
not. Mira sang the words for Celia: “Rachamin, Arka / Rachamin, Gèsu. 
Refuya, Arka / Refuya, Gèsu.” Mira had a thin, high voice, like a boy’s. 
Then she played the tune through once by herself. I joined in, 
harmonizing, and the others joined in, following her lead. It didn’t work 
right away. Flavia had brought a small drum of wood and hide, which she 
tucked under her arm; she set a strong beat. After a few repetitions, it 
started to fall into place. The song was deceptively simple. Like all the old 
songs, it was eerie; we passed the melody around between violin, horn, 
and voice. “I like it,” Giula breathed when we paused.
“Let’s try it again,” Mira suggested.
It had a simpler rhythm than the funeral song, but it was still infectious; I 
wanted to dance, but kept my feet still, self-conscious. We picked up the 
tempo. The melody was passed back to me; I started in, but an octave 
higher. We wound up in a rushing conclusion, and stopped to catch our 
breath.
“Well, I don’t know about you,” Bella said, “but my hands are warm.”
Mine were, too. I’d forgotten about the cold. I looked at Mira. To my

surprise, Mira looked disappointed, even forlorn. She saw my surprise and 
straightened up.
“Some of us have sectional rehearsals starting soon,” Mira said. “We 
should probably head back.”
“Let’s meet tomorrow,” Bella suggested.
Mira shook her head. “If we do this too often, someone will notice, and just 
might decide to make a fuss. Next week—same day, same time, same place. 
Don’t tell anyone.”
Everyone drifted out. I lingered for a moment and caught Mira’s eye.
“Why were you disappointed? That was amazing.” But Mira shook her 
head and wouldn’t answer.
I’d worried that someone—Giula, particularly—would let slip what we were 
up to. But at supper, our heresies were the farthest thing from her mind. “I 
heard the postman came today!” Giula told me. She was glowing, despite 
the cold.
“Who’d you hear it from?” I asked. The postman had been due several days 
ago; this was the third time I’d heard the rumor and I didn’t want to get 
my hopes up.
“Flavia says she saw him come in with his horse.”
“Well, it’s about time,” I said, trying to act unimpressed, but my heart was 
racing. Sure enough, when the midday meal was over, the Dean’s 
assistants came out with bulging sacks.
“Sit!” the Dean bellowed. “No one’s getting their mail unless they are 
seated and behaving themselves.”
Giula bounced up and down in her seat. “It’s been months and months,” 
file:///C|/Downloads/Kritzer,%20Naomi%20-%20Eliana%...Eliana%2001]%20-%20Fires%20of%20the%20Faithful.html (49 of 400)08/02/2006 11:47:46

she said.
“Two months, same as always,” I said, “plus four days, since he’s late.”
I had a letter; so did Giula and Bella. “You all have until tomorrow 
morning to finish any letters you want to send,” the Dean announced. The 
room was quiet as people broke the seals and unfolded their letters. Not 
everyone’s news was good. Across the table from me, Bella went ashen, 
then stood and ran out of the hall.
Dear Eliana, my mother’s handwriting said, we’re all healthy and doing 
fine. I sighed in relief. We hope this letter finds you equally well. The 
harvest was good, thank the Lady. She went on to enumerate the village 
gossip. Doratura was fine; more than fine, Doratura was beginning to 
thrive again. But all these hungry people! she added. Refugees from the 
devastated southern parts of Verdia were streaming north, and many had 
passed through Doratura. All this desperation . . .
Near the bottom of the letter, she added, Good news! Donato and his wife 
have had another child, a fine little boy. I suppressed an exclamation; 
Donato’s daughter was almost eight years old, and he and his wife had 
been unable to have another since then. Donato couldn’t write, but tucked 
into the folded letter was a thin sheet with an ink drawing of a sleeping 
baby: Donato’s son. I smiled as I smoothed the drawing, careful to keep 
even a corner of the paper away from the damp spot where I’d spilled my 
tea.
Giula started babbling about the news from her village— several dozen 
weddings, funerals, and infants of people I’d never met. I excused myself 
to go find Bella; Mira followed me. We found Bella and Flavia by the wall 
at the edge of the conservatory, Bella weeping against Flavia’s shoulder.

“My sister died,” Bella said when she could speak again. “My youngest 
sister. She was just a baby when I left.”
“I’m sorry,” I whispered.
Bella wiped her eyes with her sleeve. “My brothers are leaving the village 
and going north to look for work. My father wants to go, too, but my 
mother is almost mad with grief—Erucia was her favorite.” She paused. 
“When my father wrote the letter, he said they have food enough to last a 
few more weeks, and then they will have nothing. ‘Pray for us,’ they said.” 
Bella’s hand tightened over the letter, crumpling it. “If the Lady is listening 
to our prayers, why did every seed my parents planted die in the ground? 
Why did this happen to us?”
Flavia tightened her arm around Bella’s shoulder.
“Well,” Bella said, and wiped her eyes again, impatiently. “Tell me your 
news. I don’t want to be the only person sharing my letter.”
“I didn’t have any mail,” Mira said. “That’s what comes of moving around. 
People don’t know where to find you.”
Bella laughed a little at that, the sound catching in the tears still in her 
throat.
“Everyone in my family is fine,” I said.
Flavia unfolded her own letter. “My family is also well,” she said. “But 
soldiers have been marching through our village, heading south. No one 
knows why. We know that the Vesuviani were well and truly beaten, so 
what does the Emperor have to fear now? Besides, no one has seen a Circle 
detachment, and how would the soldiers fight without magefire?”
I shook my head. Bella’s head was still bowed, and Mira’s eyes were fixed

on Bella’s face.
“Also,” Flavia said, folding her letter again and putting it away, “this is 
kind of interesting. You know that song about the wicked stepmother with 
the poisoned honey— the song reached our village sometime in the last 
month. My mother mentioned it in passing.” Bella looked up at that, and 
Flavia gave her a sympathetic smile. “And before you ask, Bella, no—they 
don’t know what it means, either.”
We all comforted Bella as well as we could, though we had no answers to 
offer her, and she didn’t want our prayers. Back in my room, I took out the 
box where I kept my letters from under my bed, opened the lid, and put 
the newest letter on top.
“How is your family?” Mira asked.
“They’re all fine,” I said.
“Any new nieces or nephews?”
“One nephew.” Mira was acting interested; I sighed, resigned myself to the 
change in subject and started telling her about the news from my village. 
I’m sure I sounded just like Giula, babbling on about a bunch of people 
Mira didn’t know.
“So your village isn’t affected by the famine, then?” she asked.
“No,” I said. “The war never came to our part of Verdia. Some of the men 
were conscripted to fight in the army, but even then, they got by.”
“What does your village think caused the famine?”
“They say that the retreating Vesuviani soldiers sowed salt in the fields,” I 
said. “That’s the prevailing theory, at least.”
“Have you heard any others?”

“There are some who believe that the Maledori poisoned the land. Others 
think that the Lord and the Lady are punishing them, though of course the 
priests say that the Lady never wishes ill upon Her children.”
“What did your family think of the war itself?”
I sighed, trying to think back to the letters my mother had sent as it was 
starting. “There had been raids from Vesuvia, coming across the border to 
steal crops and burn fields—not into my village, but still, close enough to 
feel as if the wolves were at our neighbor’s door; if not our own. The story 
that went around right before the army marched— about the farm family 
burned with their crops—hit my mother hard. I remember one letter 
where she talked about how it could have been her and my father and 
brothers, even though they were a few days’ walk from the border and not 
really that vulnerable to raids.”
Mira nodded, not saying anything.
“What were things like in Cuore during the war?” I asked.
“The food shortages didn’t hit us as hard,” Mira said. “You probably would 
have guessed that.”
“What do people in Cuore say caused the famine?” I asked.
Mira’s voice was heavy. “Salt.” She didn’t seem to want to say anything 
more.
After Mira blew out her candle and we lay down, I lay awake for longer 
than usual. After a long time, Mira thought I was asleep, and in the 
darkness, I could hear her choking back wrenching, wracking sobs.
The next morning, the priest and priestess announced a prayer service, for 
Bella’s sister and all the other relatives we’d just found out we’d lost.

Lessons and rehearsals were canceled, and I trudged reluctantly to the 
chapel.
“Lord and Lady,” the priest intoned. “Look down upon us, thy servants, 
and have mercy. May the hungry be fed; may the grieving be comforted. 
May the dead find peace in thy eternal garden.”
“So may it be,” we said. I stopped listening. Giula sat to my right, sitting on 
her hands to keep them warm; she’d been distracted enough by Bella’s sad 
news that she hadn’t even scrambled for an aisle seat. Mira sat on my left; 
she had a glazed look, like she wasn’t listening any more than I was. Bella 
sat in the pew in front of us. Her eyes were red from crying, and she did 
not look comforted.
As we left the chapel service, Bella caught Mira’s arm. “Our ensemble plays 
today,” she said.
Mira nodded as if she’d been thinking the same thing.
We met after the midday meal. Bella reached the north practice hall first. 
“You know the funeral song,” she said to me. “Teach us.”
It worked better this time. I played the song through, then played it a line 
at a time, the group playing the line back to me. Da dat da da dat da wham 
wham wham. Da dat da da dat da wham wham wham. I stamped out the 
rhythm with Flavia’s drumming. Everyone else was stamping with the 
beat, too. We passed the music to Bella, and she began improvising, taking 
the music higher and higher and higher. There was an odd feeling in the 
air. It was like a swarm of bees in my head, or like standing on a wooden 
floor right over the percussionist sectionals, feeling the rolling bass more 
than hearing it. Like I was inside a cello. I was breathless; something was 
going to happen.

Then Celia stopped singing and stepped out of the circle. Her face was very 
white. “This is wrong,” she said.
Bella opened her mouth to say something scathing, but Mira put a 
restraining hand on Bella’s arm. Celia went on. “We’ve crossed the line,” 
she said. “It’s one thing to play for the sake of the music, but you can’t say 
anymore that that’s what we’re doing. I’m not going to turn away from the 
Lady. Worshipping the old gods is wrong.”
In the silence, she put on her cloak and left the hall.
“We’d better not play anymore today,” Mira said. Her voice was gentle, 
and she was speaking to Bella. Bella shook her head, not saying anything.
The door to the practice hall swung open. We looked over, expecting Celia, 
but it was Giorgi—the cook’s assistant and the village healer. “We need to 
talk,” he said.
Bella stepped forward. “About what?” she asked.
“I don’t think you realize the sort of trouble you could get into for what 
you’re doing,” Giorgi said. “Celia’s right; you’ve crossed the line. The Dean 
and the teachers know that students play the Old music—they did the 
same, when they were students—but alone, and in secret. Not like this.”
“This is the way the music is supposed to be played,” Bella said.
“Of course,” Giorgi said. “That’s why you need to stop.”
Bella was shaking her head and I said, “I don’t understand.”
Giorgi gave me an exasperated look. “You probably have grandmothers 
who bless themselves to ward off the evil eye, don’t you?”
Flavia touched her forehead, heart, left shoulder, and right shoulder. 
“B’shem Arka, v’barah, v’nehora kadosha,” she said in the Old Tongue.

“Like that?”
“Yes. For a long time, the Fedeli have carefully ignored some small amount 
of Old Way practice, mocking it as superstition instead of treating it as a 
serious threat. But that’s changing—in Cuore, and elsewhere. Conservatory 
students are kept deliberately isolated, so you had no way of knowing 
that.” He turned to Mira. “You, however, had an obligation to warn these 
children what you were getting them into. And you did not.”
I glanced at Mira, expecting her to look defiant. Instead, she looked 
crushed.
Giorgi went on. “If Celia decides to make a fuss, the Fedeli could be 
summoned to the conservatory, to look for heresy, apostasy, disloyalty—
anything and anyone they could find. You could get far more people killed 
than just your little group. Do you understand what I’m telling you?”
Now even Bella had lowered her eyes.
“This is not the time for this music,” Giorgi said. “This is not the place. You 
are children, and you are playing with fire. I just hope you don’t all end in 
fire.” He turned his back on us and left the hall.
“I’m sorry,” Mira whispered.
“Don’t be sorry,” Bella said. “This was the right way to pray for my sister.” 
She packed up her trumpet and put on her cloak. Giula slipped out after 
her, her face white.
Flavia wrapped her drum and put on her cloak. Mira was still staring at the 
floor, her face bleak, and Flavia took Mira’s chin to lift her face. “I knew we 
could get in trouble,” Flavia said, “and I’ve never believed that 
conservatories are somehow invulnerable to the Fedeli. And I chose to play

with you. Take heart.”
Alone with Mira in the north practice hall, I touched her hand gently. “I’m 
not sorry, either,” I said. “Come on. If we’re not going to do something 
illegal, let’s go somewhere warmer.”
A few days later, I overheard Bella talking to Giorgi, and paused to listen. 
And to warn them, of course, if anyone else tried to overhear their 
conversation. “Teach me, then,” Bella said. “I don’t care how dangerous it 
is. I don’t care what the Fedeli could do to me.”
“You have to promise me that you won’t play the songs anymore,” Giorgi 
said. “Faith is more than music—and faith is more important.”
“I swear,” Bella said.
Giorgi had her swear in the old way, kissing the crux of an X. Then Bella 
blessed herself: “B’shem Arka, v’barah, v’nehora kadosha.”
“That blessing means In the name of God, and Her son, and the Holy 
Light,” Giorgi said. “It’s not a prayer, exactly—it’s a blessing, a dedication.”
“Teach me a prayer,” Bella said.
“Rachamin, Arka. Rachamin, Gèsu,” Giorgi said, and I recognized the 
words of the healing song we’d played together. “It means, God, have 
mercy; Gèsu, have mercy.‘”
“Protect us from the Maledori,” Bella said. “How do I say that in the Old 
Tongue?”
“There are no Maledori,” Giorgi said. “All that happens is the will of God.”
I felt a sudden cold uncertainty in my stomach. Everything? The priests 
and priestesses taught that the Lord and the Lady wished only good for us; 
all suffering came from the Maledori. What sort of God would send pain to 
Her followers?

“B’shem Arka,” Bella said. “God’s will be done.”
You really are an apostate, I thought. But that night, staring into the 
darkness, I whispered Giorgi’s prayer— “Rachamin, Arka. Rachamin, 
Gèsu.”

“Today we’re going to work on dancing,” Domenico said. “Pair up.”
Mira and I grabbed hands without so much as looking around the room; 
Giula cast a longing look at Domenico before partnering off with Bella, 
who was rolling her eyes at Giula’s wistfulness. Celia danced with Flavia. 
There were other girls in the conservatory class on courtly graces, but 
Mira’s arrival meant there was an even number now, so no one had to 
dance with the teacher. Not that Domenico had ever picked Giula as his 
partner, but that didn’t stop her from hoping.
As the teacher who’d spent the longest time in Cuore, Domenico had for

years been stuck teaching this class. Few of us (if any) would ever play in 
Cuore, but certain etiquette would be expected among the nobility even in 
Pluma.
“You’ll take turns dancing the woman’s part,” Domenico said, and 
reviewed the steps to the dance. “One-two-three, one-two-three, left-right-
left, right-left-right, got it?”
I didn’t have it. Mira was supposed to be dancing the man’s part, but I was 
so busy watching my feet that I failed to follow her lead and we collided. 
Mira laughed. “How are you going to flirt with your partner if you’re 
staring at your feet, Eliana?”
“Would it be better if I batted my lashes at you while stepping on your 
toe?”
“You’re supposed to trust me to keep my feet out of the way.”
I tried looking up at Mira, and she gave me a look of mock gallantry. “You 
look lovely this evening, my dear,” she said in a husky voice, and I started 
laughing again and tripped over the hem of my robe.
Mira actually knew how to dance court-style, which startled me a bit; I 
wondered if she was worried that the other girls would notice. I was fairly 
certain that dancing was not taught at most seminaries. Still, when I 
managed to relax enough to actually follow her lead, I found that I didn’t 
step on her feet, or trip over my own. Domenico stopped counting and 
started playing his violin for us to dance to, which was distracting enough 
that I fell out of step again. “Hey,” Mira said, and let go of my hand to 
punch my arm. “Pay attention to your partner, not the music.”
“Again,” Domenico said. “One-two-three, one-two-three.”
Mira cupped her hand lightly against my waist and gave me a grin. “You’re

allowed to smile while you’re dancing, you know.”
I grimaced at her, knowing that if I tried to answer I’d fall out of step again.
“You’re supposed to be enjoying yourself, or at least convincing your 
partner that you’re enjoying yourself.” When I didn’t answer, Mira pulled a 
solemn face and said,
“Oh, the horror, the horror! I could be practicing my violin, but instead 
people are making me dance!”
That did it. I started laughing again and fell out of step. Domenico stopped 
playing. “Do I need to separate the two of you? Mira, why don’t you dance 
with Giula; Eliana, you and Bella can partner up.”
Bella was a more competent dancer than I was, but not as skilled as Mira; I 
had to watch my feet again. She was preoccupied and didn’t make much 
eye contact. I wished I knew what she was thinking about.
“You aren’t telling us what some of us most want to know,” Giula said 
when Domenico called for us to stop. “How do we get young men to ask us 
to dance?”
Domenico returned her pout with a wry smile. “You flirt, Giula! Do you 
really need instructions?” Giula blushed and pouted some more. “Well, all 
right, then. There are a hundred ways to flirt, but one of the most popular 
these days, or so I hear from my friends still at court, involves flowers.”
Giula was now paying rapt attention, as was most of the rest of the class. 
Bella still looked preoccupied; Mira caught my eye and made a face to get 
me to laugh again.
“Many of the ladies and gentlemen at the Imperial Court carry flowers, 
either in their hands or fixed to their clothing,” Domenico said. “They’re

used to cover up unpleasant smells; fresh flowers are preferred but 
expensive, and sachets of dried flower petals the less pricey alternative. If 
you find a young man attractive, you can buy a flower—a rose, ideally—and 
drop it when he’s nearby; with luck, he’ll pick it up and bring it to you. If a 
young man wants to approach you, he might buy a flower, then bring it to 
you saying that he thinks you might have dropped it.”
“And if I’m not interested?” Bella asked.
“Then you say—” Domenico put on a squeaky falsetto voice “ ‘—You must 
be mistaken, signore, that isn’t mine.’ ”
“What if you drop your flower, and the wrong man picks it up for you?” 
Celia asked.
“Then you’re probably out a flower,” Domenico said. “And the man who 
brings it to you will probably be quite embarrassed, just as you’d be in his 
shoes.”
Domenico moved on to talk a little about proper forms of address if we 
happened to want to flirt with a member of the Imperial family, or high-
ranking members of the Fedeli or the Circle. “The Emperor rules,” he said, 
quoting an aphorism we’d all heard before. “The Circle protects, and the 
Fedeli guide.”
Bella stirred. “I’ve heard that it’s common knowledge outside the 
conservatory that the Circle and the Fedeli rule, not the Emperor.”
Domenico raised one eyebrow. “Bella, you’re going to get yourself in 
trouble someday if you’re not careful,” he said, and ended the class.
That evening, I bent my head over my music theory assignment while 
turning Bella’s comment over and over in my mind. Domenico was 
typically quite frank about life at court, so why would he repeat something

he knew wasn’t true? Unless he feared getting in trouble. But then, why 
would Bella—or Giorgi, who undoubtedly was the person who’d told her 
this—be any more reliable? I pushed my stool back finally and looked at 
Mira, who sat cross-legged on her bed, her head bent over a book. “I 
suppose you’d know,” I said, setting down my pen.
“Know what?” Mira said, looking up. A lock of hair had fallen over one eye, 
and she twitched it back behind her ear.
“Who really rules. Like Bella said, we’re always told that the Emperor 
rules, the Circle protects, and the Fedeli guide—that the High Circle and 
the High Priest and Priestess of the Fedeli advise the Emperor, but he 
makes the decisions.”
Mira gave me a steady look. “Bella is absolutely correct. It’s the Circle and 
the Fedeli who rule, and everyone in Cuore knows that. Even in the 
provinces—if you’d been older when you left your home village, the 
Emperor’s place in the ensemble of power, or his lack of one, would 
probably be known to you.”
“Oh,” I said, and lowered my eyes, disappointed. Bella could be such a 
know-it-all, and her relationship with Giorgi had only made this worse. It 
was a disappointment to find out that she really did know what she was 
talking about.
“When I say the Circle and Fedeli, of course, I mean the Circle Council and 
the High Priest and Priestess. There are about two hundred mages in the 
Circle, not counting initiates, and there are thousands of priests and 
priestesses in the Fedeli. Of course it’s not all of the Fedeli and the Circle 
who rule; that would be absurd.”

I laughed a little, though Mira wasn’t really smiling. “This should stand me 
in good stead if I ever do get to play at Court,” I said. “I won’t be quite as 
ignorant as they’d like to keep me.”
“Playing at court really is what you want?” Mira asked.
“Why else would I be here? It’s what almost everyone here wants. There’s 
no higher position for a musician.”
“Domenico gave it up,” Mira said.
“That’s true. He didn’t like court. That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t.”
Mira was silent for a long moment, looking into her candle. “There’s an old 
saying I’ve heard: ‘The one who pays the piper, calls the tune.’ I wouldn’t 
want to play the tunes the Circle calls.”
“Well, if you want to get technical about it, they’re paying for my ‘piping’ 
now, in a way. They pay my scholarship. And Bella’s, and Giula’s, and 
Flavia’s, and Celia’s. They paid Lia’s until she left. We’re all beholden to 
the Circle, since we’re sponsored by them. And thus so is Domenico, even 
if he left court years ago.”
Mira wouldn’t look up at me. “And none of you wish to speak ill of your 
benefactors?”
“It doesn’t stop Bella,” I said. I wanted, desperately, to lighten the mood, 
but I wasn’t sure how. “I’ve met only one mage in my life, anyway, and he 
was nice enough.”
“Really?” Now Mira looked up. “Tell me about it.”
“It was when I was six. You know how the Circle sends people down into 
the provinces to find children who are particularly good at magery? Well, I 
was good enough as a child that my father took me up to the next village to 
be tested.”

Mira leaned forward, putting her book down. “How good were you?”
“Honestly, it wasn’t so much that I was good at magery as that I was 
precocious. I started making witchlight when I was barely more than a 
baby, and when I was six I could light a fire with damp wood. That’s why 
my father thought I had a chance.” I smiled ruefully at the memory. “But 
the man from the Circle wanted me to set fire to stone. He gave me a little 
pebble and asked if I could make it burn. I tried and tried, but I couldn’t 
even warm it up.”
“Too bad,” Mira said.
“Yeah, well. It was worth the trip. The mage was very kind; he gave me an 
apple for trying so hard, and a dozen more to my father for bringing me 
in.” I shrugged and smiled at Mira, but her face had gone hard. She ducked 
her head down to look at her book again. “What? Mira, was your trouble in 
Cuore with the Circle?”
“I don’t want to talk about it.” Her voice was hard.
I looked down at my music theory work; I had dripped a great big inkblot 
onto the paper. I muttered a curse and blotted it up as well as I could. “I’m 
sorry, Mira. I shouldn’t have brought it up.”
“Don’t worry about it,” she said, but she didn’t want to talk more that 
evening.
Mira was still being distant with me the next morning at breakfast, and I 
felt terrible about it, but didn’t know what to say to mend the rift. Thinking 
back to our class with Domenico, I thought that maybe I could offer her a 
flower, as if I were a young man approaching a young lady at court; that 
would make her laugh, and everything would probably be all right after 
file:///C|/Downloads/Kritzer,%20Naomi%20-%20Eliana%...Eliana%2001]%20-%20Fires%20of%20the%20Faithful.html (64 of 400)08/02/2006 11:47:46

that. Finding a flower would be difficult, though. It was late November, 
and the roses and most of the other flowers around the conservatory had 
gone dormant for the winter. That had to be true at court, as well, though; 
Domenico would know an appropriate offering for late November. I could 
ask him at my lesson, later that morning.
But that lesson, at it turned out, was canceled. As all of us (except for 
Mira) lingered over our tea, the Dean came in and knocked the floor with 
his staff to quiet us. He was trailed by three of the teachers; none were 
smiling. “There is solemn news,” the Dean said. “The Emperor is dead. His 
son, Travan, has ascended to the Imperial throne. May the Lady shelter 
the soul of Emperor Iago; may the Lady guide and defend Emperor 
Travan.”
“So may it be,” we chorused, stunned to near-whispers.
“Classes and lessons are all canceled for the rest of the day,” the Dean said. 
“Father Claro and Mother Emilia are convening a prayer service in one 
hour to mourn the old Emperor and pray for the new; I expect to see you 
all there.” He nodded to all of us and stomped out, presumably going to 
tell the same thing to the boys. A few minutes later, we heard the chapel 
bell tolling.
I went looking for Mira, hoping that she’d have gotten over her anger 
enough to sit next to me, but I couldn’t find her. She wasn’t in her favorite 
practice room, not in the north practice hall, not by the wall that bordered 
the conservatory grounds. I even tried the bell tower, which was where I’d 
normally have looked for Bella—of course, neither Mira nor Bella was 
there that day. In the end, I sat with Flavia, since Giula had managed to 
score a seat next to the aisle. When we rose for the priest and priestess to

come down the center aisle, I saw that Mira and Bella were both sitting in 
the very back row.
It was a strange service. In form, it closely resembled the service of prayer 
and mourning that we had observed a month earlier, after so many 
students had received bad news through the mail—but there had been a 
bitter edge a month ago that was missing today. The death of an Emperor 
was a solemn occasion, but it was an impersonal sort of mourning. None of 
us, except possibly for Domenico, had ever met the Emperor. I stole a look 
at Domenico, standing with the teachers near the front; his face was grim 
and inscrutable, and I couldn’t tell if he was grieving over the Emperor’s 
death, worried about the new Emperor, or thinking about something else 
entirely.
But because the ascension of a new Emperor to the Imperial throne was an 
occasion for celebration, even as the death of the old Emperor was a cause 
for mourning, we were supposed to have a festival meal after the prayer 
service, with meat, wine, and fruit pies. With the famine around us, 
though, the conservatory’s larder couldn’t permit much of a celebration. 
Our cook planned very carefully in order to have meat in the stew on 
festival days, and an unplanned festival was not part of his calculations. 
Our midday meal was the same bean soup as always. We did each receive a 
small serving of stewed apples. Mira still didn’t seem to want to look at 
me, so we let Giula babble on about the Emperor’s death and the Dean’s 
announcement and the prayer service and which boy students had 
managed to snare aisle seats on short notice.
“How old was Emperor Iago, anyway?” Celia asked as we ate our fruit.
“Not that old,” I said. “My father’s age.” I remembered my father noting

this once. “Too young to die of old age. I wonder how he died?”
“A sudden illness?” Flavia said. “Or maybe an accident. Even if he wasn’t 
old, things happen.”
“They certainly do,” Bella said, and raised one eyebrow.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Celia asked.
“I’d better not say anything,” Bella said. “Like Domenico said, I could get 
myself in trouble one of these days.”
Mira scraped up the last of her fruit and excused herself, still avoiding my 
gaze. “Lessons or not, I’m going to go practice,” she said.
There was a pause as she left, and then four pairs of eyes turned toward 
me. I didn’t really want to try to explain to Giula, Flavia, Celia, and Bella 
why Mira was angry at me, so I shoved my plate away as well and left the 
hall.
I picked up my violin and went to practice for a while, but my mind kept 
returning to Bella’s comment. Finally I sighed and put my violin back in its 
case, and went to find Bella; if I asked her what she meant, she probably 
would tell me, despite her claim about wanting to avoid trouble. She just 
wanted to be asked, and I was curious enough about what she knew (or 
thought she knew) that I was willing to give her that satisfaction.
I found Bella in the library, her head bent over a musical score, brown 
from age. “Hey,” I said, and pulled up a chair across from her. “Is that for 
one of our classes?”
“No, actually.” Bella slid the score gently across the table toward me. “I’m 
doing some independent research.”
I raised my eyebrows. “On what?”

“Honey.” She grinned at my puzzlement. “You remember that song that 
showed up last fall? The wicked stepmother with the poisoned honey? 
Well, I’ve been trying to figure out what the song is talking about.”
“And you think that’s in the library?”
“Sure, why not? I’m looking up old folk songs that mention honey, to see 
whether any of those songs have double meanings. Also stepmothers, and 
treacherous gifts.”
“I can’t believe that the person who wrote that song would have been 
referring to an old, forgotten folk song, anyway,” I said.
“True, but I could still get ideas,” Bella said.
“So have you?”
“I’ve found lots of great stories, but none that answer my question,” Bella 
said. “No songs about poisoned honey. I did find a song about someone 
who slew their lover for rejecting their gift. And I found another song 
where someone got a poisoned garment that killed her.”
“Any underlying meanings?”
Bella sighed. “No. Not really. Well, unless you count the moral, ‘Don’t 
accept gifts from people who hate you, even if they seem perfectly 
innocent.’ ”
“Seems like a good rule to live by,” I said. I glanced down at the score Bella 
had been studying. “So what does Giorgi say about the song?”
A look of annoyance crossed Bella’s face—annoyance at Giorgi, not at me. 
“Just that it’s a waste of time to worry about it.”
“You don’t agree?”
“Obviously not.”

I couldn’t keep myself from smiling a little, and Bella noticed. “Oh yes,” 
she said, and gave me a wry smile back. “I still keep my own conscience, 
even if Giorgi is my teacher.”
“I rather thought he was more than your teacher,” I said. “You always said 
that if you were going to risk being thrown out of the conservatory, it 
would be for a man, not a boy. Giorgi’s a man.”
“True enough, but I’m not saying,” Bella said, and gave me a smile that 
told me everything I wanted to know.
“So what has Giorgi told you about the Emperor’s death?” I asked. “If you 
aren’t worried that by telling me, you’ll get yourself into trouble.”
Bella laughed. “Oh, I just said that to annoy Celia. She’s going to tie herself 
in knots for a week before she breaks down and asks me what I meant. 
Giorgi said that there have been rumors for a while that the Circle, or 
maybe the Fedeli, were angry at the Emperor. The story is that he was 
poisoned; whoever did it thinks Travan will be easier to manipulate.”
“Things happen, huh?” I said.
“They certainly do. Especially at court.”
I found myself wondering if Bella still wanted to play at court, given all the 
stories she was hearing from Giorgi, but I didn’t quite dare ask. I changed 
the subject, instead. “Any idea where I could get a flower?”
“Any particular kind?”
I shrugged. It probably didn’t really matter. “Something pretty, that smells 
nice.”
“Some of the herbs in the garden flower this time of year. Ask Giorgi. He 
should be able to help you.”

I went from the library to the back door of the kitchen. The door was 
standing open, to let in the cool air; I poked my head in but didn’t see 
Giorgi. The kitchen was damp and yeasty and very warm, despite the open 
door.
“May I help you?” It was one of the other assistants.
“I’m looking for Giorgi.”
The assistant nodded; a few moments later, Giorgi emerged, wiping his 
hands on his apron. His sleeves were rolled up past his elbows and his face 
was flushed from the heat. “Is anyone sick?” he asked.
“No, nothing like that,” I said. “But Bella said you might be able to help 
me.”
Giorgi stepped outside the kitchen. “Is this about—”
“It’s nothing about the music,” I said. “I want a flower, just one flower. 
Bella said you might have a flowering herb you could give me a cutting 
from.”
Giorgi looked a little surprised. “Sure,” he said. “I could do that.” He 
stepped back into the kitchen to hang up his apron and grab a small knife; 
rolling his sleeves down, he slipped a cloak over his shoulders and we 
walked down to the kitchen garden.
The conservatory did try to grow at least some of its food, and the kitchen 
gardens spread out along the slope of the hill that led down from the back 
door. This time of year, nearly everything was dormant. Withered bean 
plants hung slack from their trellises, and bits of rock marked out beds 
where parsnips, cabbages, and onions would be planted in the spring. The 
herb garden was in a sheltered spot next to a stand of apple trees. The

rosemary and parsley twined as green and fragrant as ever, but Giorgi 
reached past them to a plant with a profusion of yellow blossoms. “Winter 
jasmine,” he said. “How much do you need?”
“Just a sprig,” I said.
Giorgi snipped off a piece and gave it to me. I inhaled the scent—it was 
delicate and heady all at once, perfect for my plans. “Thank you,” I said.
“Is there anything else I can do for you?” Giorgi asked.
It occurred to me that if I wanted to ask him to teach me about the Old 
Way faith, as he was teaching Bella, this was the right time to ask him. We 
were alone; no one would overhear us. His manner was reserved but kind, 
and I thought that if I did ask him to teach me, he would probably agree. I 
knew nothing about the Old Way beliefs, and what I’d overheard Giorgi 
telling Bella didn’t sound terribly appealing—but there was the music. I 
knew I wanted to know more.
But I was afraid that if I asked, Giorgi would expect me to commit myself 
to it wholeheartedly, like Bella. And I wasn’t sure I was willing to do that. 
Besides, Giorgi seemed to believe that just playing the music was a terrible 
risk, and I suspected that if I asked him to teach me about the Old Way, he 
would insist that I stop playing the songs. Our subversive little ensemble 
may have been broken up, but I still played the music on my own. In fact, 
Mira had taught me the other songs she knew—a song to celebrate the 
return of spring, a song for safety during childbirth, and a song of praise to 
God. The music was part of the bond I had with Mira, and I wasn’t giving 
that up.
“The flower is all that I needed,” I said. “Thank you.”
I wondered, as I walked back from the garden with the jasmine clutched in

one hand, if I was playing the tunes the Circle called, after all.
* * *
I had intended to find Mira and bring her the jasmine with the line 
Domenico had suggested in class: “Excuse me, signora, but I believe you 
dropped this.” I had imagined myself saying it in a husky, deep voice like 
Mira had used when teasing me while dancing, and generally playacting 
the part of a lovesick nobleman. But I couldn’t find Mira, and the longer I 
looked the more the idea seemed stupid. Still, I had the jasmine, and after 
asking Giorgi for it, I couldn’t just throw it away. Finally, I went back to 
our room, left it on her bed, and went to practice.
It was late afternoon, almost time for dinner, when someone knocked on 
the door of my practice room. I answered it, expecting Bella or Giula, but 
Mira stood in the doorway, the jasmine in her hand. I fell back a step, not 
knowing what to say.
“Excuse me, signora,” Mira said. She held the jasmine sprig to her nose 
and inhaled the scent for a moment. “I believe you must have dropped 
this.”
I looked down at my feet, then back up at Mira. “Why yes,” I said. “That 
does look like mine.”
“I’m so glad I was able to return it to you,” Mira said. She took my hand 
and folded it around the flower. “It’s a lovely flower and it would have 
been a shame for it to get lost.”
I nodded, not certain of what to say.
“Signora, I was just going to dinner,” Mira said, and struck a gallant pose, 
offering me her arm. “Would you care to accompany me?”

That was easy. “I’d love to,” I said, and took her arm. And everything was 
all right again.
 
 
CHAPTER FOUR

Rise up, daughter, and dance with me; and in the dancing, know the 
glory of God. 
 
—The Journey of Gèsu, chapter 2, verse 11 
 
 
During the week before Mascherata, the Midwinter festival, it was bitterly 
cold. None of us spent more time outside than we had to; even Bella 
abandoned her usual vigil for the postman. Still, as I huddled next to Mira 
at the midday meal, cupping my hands around my soup bowl, I was in a 
good mood. Mascherata, even the watered-down version celebrated by the 
conservatory, was a fun holiday, with music and dancing. My lesson day 
fell on Mascherata itself, which meant that Domenico and I would trade 
places and I would teach the lesson; I was trying to come up with insults to 
hurl at him if he decided to be a recalcitrant student who didn’t spend 
enough time practicing.
Then the Dean of the conservatory came out to the center of the dining 
hall, slamming a staff to the floor for attention. At first I assumed it was 
the postal delivery— then I saw the two black-clad strangers beside him 
and felt Mira go rigid beside me.

The Dean’s voice was strangely flat. “This is Father Cassio and Mother 
Galeria, from the Sudditi Fedeli della Signora. They have honored us with 
a visit to observe our celebration of the Mascherata festival.”
The room went suddenly very quiet, as if a dropped wine cup had just 
shattered on the floor.
“There will be a special chapel service tomorrow morning, in their honor,” 
the Dean said. “I expect everyone to be there.”
Cassio stepped forward. His hair was black, and he smiled too easily. “We 
are looking forward to celebrating the Lord’s Victory with you,” he said, 
and if I hadn’t known what he was, I might almost have liked him. “The 
Fedeli are making a special trip through Verdia this winter, to pray for the 
Lady to restore the land. People often greet us with fear, but I hope that 
you will all soon learn better. As the Lady has told us, ‘Innocence doesn’t 
need to hide.’ We are the servants of the Lady, here to teach and to 
encourage. The Lady’s faithful children have nothing to fear from us.”
Cassio and Galeria swept out of the room, the Dean in their wake; there 
was a sudden hushed burst of conversation, but I didn’t dare say anything. 
Bella was as white as the winter sky and Giula looked as if she were about 
to throw up. I gulped down my soup, wondering as I did it if anyone would 
tell the Fedeli that I was the first to leave the dining hall after they left, as if 
I had some secret I needed to discuss—but there was no help for it. “Meet 
in my room,” I whispered. “As soon as you can get there.”
Mira joined me first. She wrapped herself up in her cloak and sat down on 
her bed. “Have you ever encountered the Fedeli before?” she asked me.
“No. They usually leave Verdia alone. I’ve heard stories about them, of

course, but that’s all.” The moral of the stories was always the same: stay 
on their good side, and if you can’t, stay out of their way. “You have, 
though, haven’t you?”
“They’re all over, in Cuore. Like cockroaches, but with black silk robes.”
I smothered my giggle in my cloak. “Be careful, they might hear you.”
“They’re not in the dorm,” Mira said. “They’re in the Dean’s study right 
now, sitting by a warm fire and drinking hot wine.”
“Are you afraid of them?” I asked.
Mira was silent for a long time. “Of course I’m afraid,” she said. “If the 
Fedeli find out that I recruited students and taught them an Old Way song
— that’s what they’re here to find, Eliana. I could be executed. Of course 
I’m afraid.”
There was a knock at the door—Flavia. She came in and sat down, and 
Mira fell silent. Flavia tapped her hand lightly against the edge of my bed, 
drumming out a rhythm as she waited. She gave me a wry smile when she 
saw me watching. “I’m afraid I’ll tap out an Old Way song without even 
realizing it,” she said. “I could be betrayed by my own hands.”
“Be careful,” Mira said. “Don’t think they wouldn’t notice.”
Bella arrived next, then Giula, and finally Celia. The room was very 
crowded, with so many people. I sat beside Mira; Flavia and Bella sat on 
my bed. Giula and Celia pulled out our work-stools to sit on.
“We have to turn ourselves in,” Celia said as soon as the door was closed. 
“They’ll go easy on us if we confess, if we’re penitent.”
I looked at Mira. “What will they do if we all turn ourselves in?”
“If you seemed sorry, and did whatever penance they assigned, you would

almost certainly be pardoned,” Mira said.
“What about you?” I asked.
“It’s hard to say. Since I was the instigator, they would probably go harder 
on me. They would assume that I had been a member of a secret 
Redentore group before coming here. They would want names.” Mira was 
next to me, and I could feel the shudder that went through her body. “If I 
was cooperative, they might choose to show me mercy.”
“What are Redentori?” Flavia asked.
“It’s what the people who practice the Old Way call themselves,” Mira said. 
She shook her head. “If you think it’s best to turn yourselves in, do it. 
Don’t worry about me. I’ll run.”
“In winter?” Flavia said. “In weather like this? Even if they don’t catch you, 
you’ll freeze to death.”
“And if you run, they’ll know you have something to hide,” I said.
“I’ll be all right,” Mira said. She had stopped shaking, and I found myself 
certain that she was right, that she could run and survive— but I’d never 
see you again, I thought, and found myself desperate to think of another 
way.
“Then are we agreed?” Celia said. “We turn ourselves in?”
“No,” I snapped. “We aren’t.”
Bella hadn’t said a word, and I turned to her. “What do you think, Bella?”
Very deliberately, Bella said, “I’m not saying anything that she can use to 
curry favor with the Fedeli.” She jerked her head toward Celia. “But I’m 
not turning myself in. The Fedeli would not find me as repentant as I 
imagine they would require. And while dying for your faith is an honor, it’s

an honor that I would rather forgo.”
“Are you saying I’d turn you in to the Fedeli to make myself look good?” 
Celia said. Her cheeks flushed as red as if she’d been slapped.
Bella didn’t answer.
Celia’s lips tightened. “If that’s what you think of me, why did you even get 
me into this?”
“Keep your voices down,” I hissed. “Look. We’re all on the same side. 
Celia, it’s clear that your plan won’t work— if we go to the Fedeli, it’s 
entirely possible that Mira and Bella will die. I’m sure you aren’t willing to 
sacrifice their lives for your own, any more than they’d be willing to let you 
die to save themselves.”
Celia shook her head.
“Outside of this room, does anyone know we have something to hide?” I 
asked.
“Giorgi,” Bella said.
“Well, he isn’t going to go to the Fedeli and turn us in, is he?” I asked. Bella 
shook her head. “Then we’re safe as long as we all stand together. The six 
of us have to be able to trust each other.” I crossed my index fingers and 
held them up. “I swear—”
“Wait,” Mira said. She clasped her hand over mine, and I could feel her 
shaking again. “The Fedeli will use torture if they suspect that you know 
something you’re not telling them. Don’t swear an oath that you won’t be 
able to keep.”
Outside, someone was running down the hallway. It was probably just 
someone late for a lesson, but the anxious sound of the footfalls made my

heart leap into my throat. My own hands shaking, I crossed my fingers 
again. “I swear that I will not go to the Fedeli to save myself,” I said. “I will 
not offer to name names, and I will do everything in my power to avoid 
betraying you.” I kissed my crossed fingers, then added, “I make no 
promises about what I might say under torture.”
Flavia crossed her fingers and made the same oath; so did Mira. Her hands 
and voice shaking, Giula did the same. We looked at Bella; Bella looked at 
Celia.
“I’m not taking an Old Way oath,” Celia said. “That’s a sin in itself.”
“Swear by the Lady, then,” Bella said.
“Take any oath you like,” I said. “Anything we can trust.”
“I’ll give you my word,” Celia said, and tossed her curls back. “I’ll give you 
my word that I won’t go to the Fedeli to betray you. If that’s not good 
enough for you—well, keeping this a secret wasn’t my idea.” She shoved 
the stool back under my table, and walked out of the room, slamming the 
door behind her.
We were silent for a moment. Then Bella said, “I’ll give you my oath, now 
that she’s gone.” From under her robe, she took out a carved wood cross. “I 
will not betray my faith, nor will I betray any of you,” she said, and kissed 
the cross. “God will give me the strength I need. She would give you the 
same strength, too, if you asked and believed.”
“You shouldn’t be wearing that,” I said. “The Fedeli could see it. If they 
decided to search you—”
“I am in God’s hands,” Bella said, and deliberately tucked the cross back 
under her robe.

Lady’s tits, I thought. Given half an excuse, Celia might betray us; given a 
moment’s bad luck, Bella might betray herself. Flight was looking more 
and more appealing, but if anyone vanished abruptly, her friends would be 
investigated and questioned—guaranteeing Bella’s discovery as a secret 
follower of the Old Way.
Flavia was watching my face, and she gave me a wry smile. “It looks like 
we’re all in God’s hands,” she said. “Whether we want to be or not.”
That night, Mira and I lay side by side for warmth. “Were you accused of 
heresy, in Cuore?” I asked her. “Could the Fedeli recognize you?”
“No, I wasn’t accused of heresy. I didn’t have the courage to take these 
sorts of risks in Cuore,” Mira said. “And I don’t recognize Cassio or 
Galeria, so I think it’s safe to assume that they don’t recognize me. Cuore is 
a big city.”
I closed my eyes, though I didn’t feel like sleeping.
“Giorgi was right,” Mira said. “I put all of you in danger, and I should have 
known better.”
“No,” I said.
“I didn’t think that the Fedeli would ever come here—to the province of 
war and famine, desperation and starvation. The Fedeli like the comforts 
of Cuore. I thought that here, if nowhere else, would be a safe place to play 
that music.”
I slipped my arms around Mira, cradling her like a cat, but she refused to 
be comforted.
“You haven’t ever seen someone die from fire, have you?” Mira asked after 
a little while.

“No,” I said.
“I have,” Mira said. She was quiet again, then added, “It’s a terrible way to 
die. People scream until the smoke chokes them. Flesh doesn’t burn easily
—it takes a lot of wood. There’s a square in Cuore where the Fedeli execute 
unrepentant heretics; it smells like cooked rotten meat. I wandered there 
by accident once, and I had nightmares for weeks.”
“Don’t think about it,” I said, stroking Mira’s hair. Mira smelled a little like 
smoke, because of her candles, but it was a delicate smoke, not like the 
smell of greasy meat that came from the kitchen on festival days. 
“Everything will be all right.”
Mira nodded wordlessly.
“Mira,” I said. “Whatever happens, I want to face it together. Promise that 
you won’t leave me.”
“I can’t promise that,” she said. “And neither can you.”
We didn’t talk after that, but stared into the cold darkness.
We rose early for the chapel service. For once, no one was tempted to skip. 
Apparently even Bella had an understanding with her Old Way God, 
because she filed in to the chapel with the rest of us, sitting beside me with 
an impassive face.
Like all chapel services, it started with drumming, to drive away the 
Maledori. This close to Midwinter’s Eve, there shouldn’t be many Maledori 
around anyway, but it was always good to be on the safe side. Then Mother 
Emilia and Father Claro processed down the aisle, with the black-robed 
Fedeli behind them. I thought that Mother Emilia looked oddly pale, 
though it was hard to tell.

We went through the standard morning prayers. Celia, in front of me, 
spoke the prayers loudly and clearly—she knew every prayer by heart from 
attending chapel so often. Partway through the opening prayer, I began to 
worry that the Fedeli would notice my mumbling. When I ducked my head 
to listen, though, I thought there were probably enough enthusiastic show-
offs like Celia to render my own stumbles inaudible.
Mother Emilia delivered a sermon. I tried desperately to pay attention—
fearful that we’d be quizzed on it later—but it was rambling and disjointed, 
and my thoughts kept wandering. Would Celia keep her word? I wanted to 
believe that she would, but part of me wondered. And Giula—what if she 
lost her nerve? What if she lost her nerve somewhere public, like the 
chapel service? She was sitting somewhere behind me and I couldn’t see 
her; I listened for hiccuping breaths that would tell me someone back 
there was on the edge of hysteria, but heard nothing.
When Mother Emilia sat down, Galeria—the Fedele priestess—rose to 
deliver a second sermon.
Galeria started by talking about the Lady’s limitless love for us. Nothing 
we could do, she assured us, would make the Lady love us any less. It was 
precisely for this reason that the Fedeli existed—to deepen understanding 
of the Lady’s love.
I thought, You mean, to punish us because you don’t trust the Lady to do 
it, and wished I could whisper that to Mira.
Then Galeria talked about the Maledori—the dark spirits that worked 
constantly to undo the good that the Lord and the Lady worked in the 
world. The Maledori would tempt us to evil; they would offer us their 
darkness in a pleasant guise, to deceive us. I remembered the song about

the poisoned honey and wondered if the Fedeli had written it after all.
Sometimes, Galeria told us, someone would fall under the influence of the 
Maledori and not even realize it.
Beside me, Bella stared ahead, utterly impassive.
“As Fedeli, we are taught to cast the darkness out of the Maledori’s victims, 
and to bring them back into the light of the Lady’s love. If the Maledori 
have control over someone, it’s not that person’s fault. We can help them. 
But sadly, it’s the people who most need our help who are least likely to 
ask for it.
“Sometimes we can sense the darkness just by looking into someone’s eyes
—but it is each of you who know best who needs our help. If you have seen 
a friend slip away from you into the darkness, you owe it to that friend to 
try to help them. You owe it to your friend to come to us. When someone is 
truly in darkness, they can’t save themselves, and you may not be able to 
save them—but we can.
“If you suspect that a friend has fallen into the darkness of sin, blasphemy, 
heresy, or apostasy—if you care about that friend—you will come to us.”
The chapel was silent. Ahead of me, I could see Celia’s shoulders, but not 
her face; at least she wasn’t nodding in enthusiastic agreement, but I 
stared at her chestnut curls and shivered. Beside me, Bella was still 
impassive. She probably still believed that she was in God’s hands, and 
that God would protect her or not, as She chose. I stared at Celia’s back, 
wishing that I had Bella’s certainty, and wondering if I should have 
suggested that we all flee.
Galeria finished exhorting us to turn in our friends, and began to list the 
heresies that our friends might have foolishly been taken in by. The belief

that the Lady’s love was conditional. The belief that the Lord was not the 
equal of the Lady. The belief that magery was not truly the Lady’s gift. 
Then Galeria reached the Old Way.
“The so-called Old Way is perhaps the greatest darkness threatening to 
swallow the faithful today,” Galeria said. “The Old Way apostates hold that 
the Lord and the Lady are not true Gods, and that in fact a dark and cruel 
God rules the world. A God who rejected Her children for disobedience; a 
God who once condemned the world to darkness and famine.”
Famine? I refrained from stealing a glance at Bella.
“Even the practices that you may think of as harmless open the door to the 
Maledori. We’re not here to find everyone who has ever sworn an oath 
over crossed twigs, but it’s important that if you’ve done such things, you 
turn away from them now. This service will include the rite of purification, 
and minor sins will be forgiven. If you’ve done something, and you aren’t 
sure if this service has purified you, come and talk to us. We’re here to 
help.”
For the purification, Mother Emilia and Father Claro burned rose-petal 
incense; I fought back the urge to sneeze, afraid that this might constitute 
a heresy of some kind. There was more drumming, and water was 
sprinkled over the crowd. Then we filed back out of the chapel and went to 
lunch.
During the midday meal, I could tell that Celia wanted to say something; 
when we were done, she followed me back to my room. “I think the 
Maledori have Bella under their influence,” she hissed as soon as the door

I raised one eyebrow. “Just Bella? Not me, or Mira, or—”

“I think playing Old Way music falls into the category of a minor sin. At 
the conservatory, anyway. But Bella! You know perfectly well she’s gone a 
lot further than that.”
“So what are you going to do?” I stepped closer to Celia, so that she had to 
look up at me. “Are you planning to turn her in to the Fedeli?”
“Well, don’t you think we should? After what they said—they can help her.”
I grasped Celia’s wrist and yanked her over to the window. Below, we 
could see the Fedeli’s black wagon. “The Fedeli will ‘help’ her by torturing 
her until she renounces her faith. I know you haven’t always gotten along 
with Bella, Celia, but would you wish that on anybody?”
Celia jerked her wrist away. “Is it better to leave her in the hands of the 
Maledori?”
“Are you joking? Do you think Bella would give in easily? They burn 
unrepentant heretics.” I picked up one of Mira’s candles and lit it with a 
flick of my fingers. Then I grabbed Celia’s hand again and held it over the 
candle flame, so she could feel the rising heat. “Imagine Bella burning, 
Celia. Imagine hearing her screams—”
“Let me go!” Celia shrieked, jerking away from me and the candle.
“Did that hurt? Imagine the pain Bella would feel, with flames devouring 
her body and no way to escape. Imagine the stench of the smoke, the way 
it would hang in the courtyard for weeks. I’ve heard that burning human 
flesh smells like cooked meat. Imagine how it would turn your stomach, 
every time there was mutton in the stew—”
Celia turned away, her face pale. “Fine,” she said. “Have it your way.”
“You gave your word, Celia. I want you to give me your word, again, that

you will not go to the Fedeli.”
“Fine,” Celia said again. “You have my word.” But she wouldn’t meet my 
eyes as she slipped out of the room.
Mira came in a moment later. “I don’t think Celia’s going to want meat for 
weeks,” she said.
“Do you think she’s going to tell the Fedeli about us?”
“Not today,” Mira said. “I think you’ve convinced her for today.”
“Maybe we should have all run when we had the chance,” I said.
“No,” Mira said. “I think by myself I could probably have gotten away. As a 
group, we’d have been caught within hours.”
“Why would you have been able to get away?” I asked.
Mira shrugged. “I’d have stolen a horse.”
“You know how to ride?‘” I said.
“It’s not all that hard,” she said. “But it’s a skill that’s best learned before 
your life depends on it. Besides, there weren’t enough fast horses for all of 
us.”
I shook my head and gave her a grin. “You’re full of surprises, Mira.”
The whole conservatory was on edge that evening. If anything, Bella was 
the calmest person at the table. Giula’s eyes were red; Celia’s jaw was so 
tense that her neck muscles stood out like tree roots. Before the meal, 
Father Claro and Mother Emilia came in to lead us in the traditional 
offering of a portion of food to the Lady. I wondered if they were trying to 
pretend to the Fedeli that we always did this.
As I picked at the last of my food, the Dean came in with Galeria and Cassio
—and my teacher, Domenico. Domenico was chatting easily with Cassio. I

felt my eyes go wide and my face go slack; I’d always liked Domenico, and 
the idea that he would be on the side of the Fedeli had never crossed my 
mind. Domenico glanced in my direction and gestured for me to turn my 
face away. I looked down and carefully rearranged my features. Domenico 
had lived in Cuore; it was a big city, but it was possible that he’d known 
Cassio.
“I have an announcement,” the Dean said. “Under the guidance of Mother 
Galeria and Father Cassio, I have decided to expand our Mascherata 
Festivities, to better honor the Lord and the Lady. In addition to the 
chapel observance, there will be dancing in the courtyard all night.” He 
paused, and cleared his throat. “I would like to remind everyone present 
that other rules still stand.” He turned and strode brusquely out of the 
meal hall.
Other rules. We looked at each other, baffled. “Do you suppose he means 
that the boys will be at the same dance?” Flavia said.
Celia’s eyes went wide. “That must have been what he meant,” she said. 
“Where else would the boys go to dance, if we were in the courtyard?”
Bella wanted to say something snide to Celia, I could tell, and I kicked her 
shin under the table. Making Celia mad at Bella right now was not a good 
idea. With any luck, she’d be so distracted by the idea of getting to dance 
with her boyfriend— openly—we wouldn’t have to worry about her 
reporting us to the Fedeli at least until she’d slept off her hangover.
Mascherata honored the Lord’s victory over the Maledori. Because of the 
Lord’s victory, Midwinter’s Night was considered safe from all 
supernatural threats, and the Lord and Lady’s faithful could pass the night 
in wild revelry. Except for conservatory students, who normally attended a

chapel service and then danced in the hallways of the dormitories while 
the Dean turned a blind eye. It was customary to wear a costume—a mask
—to the Mascherata festivities, but I hadn’t had the chance to do that since 
I had last celebrated the holiday in my village as a child.
Conservatory students all wore the same gray robes. We had nothing we 
could wear as costumes, and no way to make masks. But in the morning, 
we discovered that the Dean—or the Fedeli—had bought yards and yards 
of black wool from the village seamstress. We were each issued a rectangle 
of black fabric from which to cut a simple mask. Mira helped me with 
mine. The wool made my cheeks itch, and I imagined I looked pretty silly. 
Mira certainly looked silly in hers.
“The point is to look like everyone else,” Mira said. “The point is to not 
stand out.”
As I tied Mira’s mask to her face, there was a knock at the door. I opened it 
to find an irate Domenico, violin case in hand.
“Were you going to skip my lesson today?” Domenico said, his voice a high 
querulous whine. “Don’t you care about my progress on my instrument?” 
He stomped into the room and started laying out his music.
On Mascherata, students and their teachers traded places for the day—but 
I had completely forgotten about our lesson. Mira caught my eye and 
grinned. “The room’s all yours,” she said, and slipped out.
“Did you want to go back to the rehearsal hall?” I asked tentatively.
“No! You’ve wasted enough of our time already,” Domenico said. “I’ll take 
my lesson in here.” He unpacked his violin and went through an elaborate 
show of tuning it up with great difficulty. He was going to be a difficult 
student, I could tell. I wished I could remember some of those cutting

remarks I’d started to think up. I pulled out my own violin and tuned up 
myself. Domenico looked at me expectantly.
“Let’s hear the concerto,” I said.
Domenico launched into a piece I’d never heard before, stumbling midway 
through the tenth measure. “I forget how it goes,” he said, and looked at 
me expectantly.
“Well,” I said. “You don’t have a recital coming up, so it’s all right if you 
don’t have it memorized yet. Why don’t you get out the music?”
Domenico began to root through the papers he’d brought to my room. “I 
must have left it in the practice room,” he said.
“You left it in the practice room?” I rolled my eyes elaborately. “Domenico, 
this is becoming an unhealthy pattern. Last week it was the music for the 
etude, and the week before, it was your bow. When are you going to learn 
to keep track of your belongings? Or is it just that you haven’t practiced it 
and don’t want me to know?”
“Of course I practiced it,” he said. “It’s just that I’ve lost the music.”
“Well, you can go copy the score out again,” I said. “In fact, after our lesson 
is over, I think you should go copy the score twice. You can leave the extra 
copy with me, for the next time you lose it.”
“So what do you want me to play?” Domenico asked.
“Let’s hear you drill on your arpeggios,” I said.
Domenico started an arpeggio drill; I half listened to his intentionally 
clumsy arpeggio, trying to think of an appropriately scathing remark, or—
failing that—something to make him play next. After a moment I realized 
that he’d segued from the arpeggio into something else. He’d segued into

the Old Way healing song.
I snatched his bow out of his hand. “Are you completely out of your 
mind?” I hissed.
“What’s wrong, teacher? I heard someone playing that song and thought it 
was pretty.”
“Well, you shouldn’t play it,” I said. “It’s an Old Way song. It’s wrong to 
play it.”
“So you’ve never played it?” he asked.
“Never,” I said.
“Then how come you recognized it, teacher?” Domenico tipped his head to 
look at me and gave me a half-wit grin.
“Everyone has heard them played,” I said. “But no one plays them. It’s 
forbidden.”
“Ah,” Domenico said. “I think I understand now.” He took the bow back 
and played an arpeggio. Still playing, he said, very softly, “Teacher, some 
strangers came to the conservatory this week. Who are they?”
“The Fedeli,” I said.
“Why are they here?”
“To make sure that we’re good,” I said. “So long as you’re good, there’s no 
reason to be afraid.”
“I’ve noticed that whenever someone tells me there’s nothing to be afraid 
of, it’s usually because there is,”
Domenico said. “And they’ve told us an awful lot of times now not to be 
afraid of them.” Domenico switched to a different key. “One of those 
strangers says he knows an old friend of mine. Did you know that I used to

live in Cuore, teacher?”
“I’d heard,” I said.
“You make all sorts of strange friends in Cuore.” He stopped playing 
arpeggios and started playing scales, up and down, up and down. “You 
learn all sorts of strange tricks there, too. Like if you try to listen in on 
someone talking, and there’s music in the room, you can’t hear what the 
people in the room are saying.”
“Is that so,” I said. I picked up my own violin and joined him in the scales.
“Eliana,” Domenico said, and the half-wit student was gone. “Be careful 
tonight. The Fedeli want to make an example of somebody. I’d really 
rather that it not be you.”
I said nothing.
“Mira’s avoidance of magery will put her under suspicion. As her 
roommate, you’ll also be under suspicion. It wouldn’t take much more 
than that to convince them that you have something to hide.”
“What should I be careful of?” I asked.
“Don’t give them that look of horror you gave me at the evening meal 
yesterday. In fact, it’s probably best if you don’t make eye contact.” 
Domenico sighed. “I’ll keep you out of trouble if I can, but my friendship 
with the Fedele priest in Cuore will get me only so far. So watch your step.”
When the lesson was over, Domenico packed up his violin and left, 
complaining that my demands were unreasonable, my teaching was 
uninspiring, and my breath stank. As he hoisted his violin to his shoulder, 
he winked at me and said, “Actually, you aren’t a half-bad teacher. You 
should consider going to work at a conservatory, once you’re done here.”

We ate the evening meal early that night, so that we could start the 
festivities as soon as the sun went down. Mira and I tied on our masks and 
wrapped our cloaks around us, because a bitter wind blew across the 
courtyard. From our room, I could hear the drums beginning— a slow, 
deep rhythm like the earth’s heartbeat. I wondered if Flavia was one of the 
drummers. Down in the courtyard, Mira and I found a bonfire; people 
were already dancing to the drumming, their bodies jerking in unison. 
There were boys in the courtyard, though few actually seemed to be 
dancing with girls. Mostly the boys were on one side and the girls were on 
the other. I didn’t see Celia, and I wondered if maybe she was over on the 
boy’s side.
In the firelight, with the crowd and the masks, it was surprisingly difficult 
to tell who was who. Mira clasped my hand, and we joined the dancers. No 
one was smiling, which was strange; one week ago, most of the girls would 
have traded their boots for the opportunity to spend a night dancing with 
the boy students. Now, though, everyone’s attention was focused on 
Galeria and Cassio—and everyone wanted to be sure to look devout. The 
drummers took turns so that they didn’t get tired, but the dancers didn’t 
have that luxury. Out of breath, Mira and I slumped briefly in the shadows, 
out of sight. “I can’t keep this up much longer,” I whispered.
“Yes, you can,” Mira said. “We’ll take breaks. You’ll make it.”
We rose and rejoined the dancers. Flavia was drumming now, and some 
other instrumentalists were joining in. I spotted Bella taking a spot beside 
Flavia and getting out her trumpet; as I forced my tired feet to move, I felt 
a surge of jealousy. Violins weren’t well suited to this sort of thing, but 
trumpet music carried over the crowd.

Dancing to honor the Lord and the Lady was supposed to be spontaneous. 
The Lady asked us to pray with our bodies as well as our voices and our 
hearts, according to Mother Emilia; a scripted prayer was not sincere. That 
might be true, but sometime during the long, cold night, we began to move 
in a sort of unison: bounce to the right, bounce to the left. Right-bounce, 
left-bounce. It was all our exhausted bodies could manage. I could hear 
Bella playing the trumpet again—something appropriately syrupy—and 
then, suddenly, I felt a strange warmth surge through the crowd. For a 
moment, I thought I’d wandered into the bonfire’s warmth without 
realizing it. But the wind was still as cold as ever; it was a different sort of 
warmth that I felt—as if I had drunk hot wine. I touched my cheek, 
wondering if my face was flushed. Bella’s trumpet music was loud in my 
ears, and when I looked at her, I saw that her eyes were wide and bright 
behind her mask. I thought I saw light shining through her—shining out of 
her. And then Cassio snatched the trumpet from her hands and threw it to 
the ground.
Bella stumbled back a step. Behind her, Flavia’s eyes were wide, but her 
face was rigid. Mira squeezed my hand tightly.
Galeria stepped forward. “What is your name?” she asked.
“Bella.” Bella knelt to pick up her trumpet, then rose to face the Fedeli.
“Bella,” Galeria said. “The Lady has spoken to me, Bella. She has shown 
me the darkness inside you. There is a terrible, terrible darkness there.” 
Galeria’s voice was high, almost frightened. “A darkness that threatens to 
spill out of you, to infect others.”
Bella said nothing.
“You can still be saved, child,” Galeria said. “Swear your loyalty to the

Lady, and all shall be well.”
For a moment, I thought that Bella was going to do it— that she would say 
whatever they wanted her to say. Then she threw back her shoulders. “I 
bear witness that the Lord and the Lady are false gods,” she shouted as 
loud as she could. “In the name of God, and Her Son, and Her Holy Light, 
I pledge my life to the truth, and nothing else!” She flipped the cross out 
from under her robe. “I am Redentore. If I must die for the truth, then so 
be it.”
Cassio yanked the cross from around her neck and threw it to the ground. 
This is it, I thought, and wondered if Mira would have a chance to steal a 
horse and get away, since Bella would be tortured and would undoubtedly 
name every one of us. But instead of binding Bella and taking her away, 
Cassio pushed Bella to her knees, then drew his knife and cut her throat.
Bella fell forward, and the students who had been dancing near the front 
leapt back from the gush of blood. Because of the crowd, I couldn’t see 
Bella as she died—I couldn’t see if she tried to make a cross on her breast, 
or if she grabbed for her throat as if she could stanch the blood. I clasped 
my own hands over my mouth, smothering my own cry of anguish. This 
isn’t happening, I thought. This isn’t real. That isn’t Bella they just 
murdered— not Bella.
“In the name of the Lady,” Cassio said, looking down at Bella, “I commend 
your soul to Her.”
I shuddered. The warmth I’d felt a few moments ago was gone, as 
thoroughly as a doused flame.
Cassio turned back to us. “Dance,” he said. “Tonight, we honor the Lord 
and the Lady.”

I might have fallen, but Mira clasped me around the waist. “Do as he says, 
or we’ll all follow Bella,” she whispered. “Move your feet. They don’t expect 
enthusiasm— just obedience.”
I managed to shuffle my feet to the music. Around me, others did the 
same. Through the crowd, I saw Celia; she had turned her face to hide 
from the Fedeli, and her mask was wet from her tears.
I wasn’t crying, because I still couldn’t believe that Bella was really dead.
At dawn, the fire had burned down, and we were sent to rest for a few 
hours. The Dean announced that all lessons and rehearsals were canceled 
for the day. Mira and I made our way back to our room, and I collapsed 
onto my bed.
Moments later, there was a knock at the door. It was Flavia. She hadn’t 
taken her mask off, and her hands were shaking. “I saw them do it,” she 
whispered. “I was standing right there. I saw Bella die.”
I let Flavia sit down on my bed. “After they cut her throat, she was 
struggling to speak,” Flavia said. “Her body convulsed, and when she saw 
me, her lips moved. She wanted to tell me something. But I can’t read lips.”
“She probably just wanted to tell us to believe,” I said. I put my arm 
around Flavia, and she pulled off her mask, leaned her face against my 
shoulder, and cried.
There was another knock at the door. Giula, this time. “I can’t sleep,” she 
said. Her voice was flat and toneless; her face was expressionless. “I’ve 
been trying, and I can’t sleep.”
“Come lie down on my bed,” Mira said. “We’ll talk to you, if you need 
company.”

“Are they going to do that to all of us?” Giula asked.
“No,” I said. “They’re not going to hurt you, Giula. I promise.”
“How can you be so sure?” she asked.
I wasn’t, really—it just seemed to me like reassuring Giula as much as I 
could would increase the chances that we’d get through this without her 
losing her nerve. “Domenico told me that he thought they wanted to make 
an example of someone. Bella was their example. They don’t need to hurt 
anyone else.”
Giula shook her head, sinking down on Mira’s bed. “I can’t believe it,” she 
said, and I wasn’t sure if she meant that she couldn’t believe me, or if she 
meant that she couldn’t believe what had happened.
There was another knock at the door, and then Celia opened the door 
before Mira could let her in. Her mask dangled from her limp fingers, and 
her eyes were swollen. She closed the door and leaned against it. “They 
weren’t supposed to do that,” she said.
Flavia’s head snapped up. “Did you turn Bella in?” she hissed.
“No!” Celia said. “How could you think that? I haven’t told them 
anything!” She sat down on my stool. “But it doesn’t matter. They were 
supposed to give her a chance to recant—”
“They did,” I said.
“They were supposed to try harder than that,” Celia said. “They wanted to 
kill Bella!”
“Keep your voice down,” Mira said.
“I don’t understand it. Why would the Lady want Her servants to do that? 
Why?”

None of us said anything.
Celia looked at me, her red eyes meeting mine. She crossed her index 
fingers. “I swear that I will not go to the Fedeli to volunteer information,” 
she said. “I will not offer to name names, and I will do everything in my 
power to avoid betraying you.” She kissed her crossed fingers.
“Thank you,” I said.
Celia nodded once, then stood up and left.
After she had gone, Flavia sat up. “You know, she has a point,” she said. “If 
the Fedeli really thought that Bella was a heretic, why wouldn’t they have 
questioned her?”
I looked at Mira.
Mira shook her head slowly. “I don’t know.”
“They must have been afraid of something,” Flavia said. “I wish I knew 
what.”
We managed to sleep a little in midmorning, Flavia beside me and Giula 
beside Mira. We slept right through the bell summoning us to the midday 
meal. Shortly after the meal ended, there was a loud rap at our door. 
“What?” I called, raising my head from the bed.
“The Fedeli have ordered that everyone at the school report to the 
courtyard,” said a voice—one of the teachers, I thought. “Immediately.”
We piled out of bed, pulled on our boots, and grabbed our cloaks. Bella’s 
body had been removed from the courtyard; all that remained was a dark 
stain on the stones. The ashes of the bonfire had been swept away. The 
Dean and the teachers organized us into lines, as if we were in chapel— the 
boys on one side of the courtyard, the girls on the other. Mira, Flavia,

Giula, Celia, and I stood together. At the end of the courtyard, Domenico 
stood with the Fedeli. I could see him smiling and joking, and my blood 
ran cold, even though I knew he wasn’t really on their side.
Once people had stopped coming out of the dorms, the teachers counted 
us twice, to be sure that everyone was there. Someone was missing—one of 
the boys—and it was determined after a few minutes of looking that he was 
in the privy, throwing up. He was escorted down to the courtyard with the 
rest of us. A freezing cold wind blew through the courtyard. I hugged my 
cloak around me, but it didn’t help. Despite the sick fear in my stomach, I 
was very hungry. I had eaten nothing that day.
The Fedeli approached the first of the boys. “Make a witchlight in your 
hand,” Cassio said. Puzzled, the boy cupped his hand and summoned a 
feeble light. Galeria held out the symbol of the Lady, two linked circles 
worked in gold, and said, “Swear your loyalty to the Lady.”
“I swear that I am the Lady’s humble and obedient servant,” the boy said, 
and kissed the gold circles.
They moved on to the next boy, and made the same request.
Beside me, I felt Mira go rigid, though her facial expression didn’t change.
The Fedeli worked their way through the boys; no one balked at the 
request. Bella would have, though, I realized. Bella would have refused to 
swear loyalty. Even if she’d survived Mascherata, she would have been 
caught here, in the courtyard.
They made their way up and down each line of girls. The wind blew 
through the courtyard, whistling a little against the stones; I heard a door 
blow shut somewhere.
To my left, they had reached Celia. “Make a witchlight in your hand,”

Cassio said. Celia made a light, her eyes staring straight ahead, past 
Cassio’s shoulder. “Swear your loyalty to the Lady.”
Celia took the symbol in her hand. “I swear that I am the Lady’s humble 
and obedient servant,” she said tonelessly, and kissed the circles.
Flavia. “Make a witchlight in your hand,” Cassio said. Flavia made a 
witchlight, and swore loyalty to the Lady.
Now it was my turn. “Make a witchlight in your hand,” Cassio said. I made 
a witchlight. “Swear your loyalty to the Lady.”
I took the circles. They were warm from all the hands that had held them, 
all the lips that had touched them. “I swear that I am the Lady’s humble 
and obedient servant,” I said. My voice rang oddly in my ears, and I felt a 
sudden surge of shame that I didn’t have Bella’s courage—even though I 
didn’t really believe in her god, either. I kissed the circles.
Mira. “Make a witchlight in your hand,” they said.
Mira raised her right hand in front of her. Her expression never changing, 
she summoned a tiny light. Beside her, I could feel a sudden warmth 
radiate from her body.
“Swear your loyalty to the Lady,” they said.
Mira dispelled the light, swore her loyalty, and kissed the circles.
Giula. “Make a witchlight in your hand,” they said.
Giula held out one trembling hand. She closed her eyes, cupping her hand 
slightly. “I—” she said, and stopped. She squeezed her eyes tighter. No 
light formed in Giula’s hand; I could see Galeria’s eyes flicker.
“I can’t do it!” Giula cried. “I want to, but I can’t! You have to believe me!” 
She fell to her knees, grasping Galeria’s sleeve and kissing the symbol of

the Lady embroidered to the side. “I swear that I am the Lady’s servant,” 
she sobbed. “I swear it! I’m loyal!”
Galeria pulled her sleeve away from Giula. “Make a witchlight, daughter,” 
she said. “Show that you are unafraid to use the gifts that the Lady has 
given us.”
Giula cupped her hands together, weeping. “Sweet and gentle Lady,” she 
choked out, but no light formed.
Domenico threaded his way through the crowd and grasped Cassio’s arm. 
“Father Cassio,” he said. “Giula is my student. Really—she’s not very 
bright, and panics easily under pressure. I can assure you that she uses 
magery on a regular basis—I’ve seen her use witchlight.”
Cassio patted Giula on the shoulder; his voice became a comforting croon. 
“The Lady accepts your profession of loyalty,” he said. “Don’t be afraid.”
Cassio and Galeria moved on, leaving Giula still sobbing on her knees. No 
one else failed—or refused—to summon witchlight. When every student at 
the conservatory had proved that they were not Redentori—or at least that 
they didn’t have enough faith to die for it—we were herded into the chapel 
for another prayer service. I sat down in the pew, lightheaded from fear 
and hunger. Giula still shook with occasional hiccuping sobs; Mira’s 
cheeks burned with a strange heat, as if the witchlight she’d summoned 
had kindled a fire inside her.
After opening prayers, Cassio preached a sermon about Old Way 
apostates. I might have learned a lot about what Bella had believed if I’d 
been able to pay attention. Instead, despite the danger, I kept almost 
dozing off. I had stayed up all night and slept only fitfully that morning, 
and I was exhausted. My mind kept running through the bedtime prayer

Giula had started to recite when she hadn’t been able to summon the 
witchlight.
 
 
Sweet and gentle Lady 
Hear my little prayer 
Hold me in your arms tonight 
I know that you are there.
Sweet and gentle Lady . . .
 
 
My hands were ice cold, and I clasped them between my knees, trying to 
listen to Cassio. He was talking about the Redentori sexual practices—
apparently, they believed in picking their own marital partners, rather 
than letting the Lady pick for them. This was yet another way that they 
went against the Lady’s will and rejected Her love. I thought that was kind 
of funny; I mean, normally—in my village—young men and women would 
make their choice, then keep trying until the Lady blessed their union. It 
wasn’t like anyone really let the Lady pick for them. I tried to imagine a 
village where the young women slept with each young man in turn, to see 
whom the Lady liked best.
When Cassio had finished, Galeria led us in a long, long prayer. For the 
death of heretics and blasphemers, for the protection of believers, for the 
peace of Bella’s soul. After each line, we repeated, “So may it be.” I stopped 
listening after a while; I didn’t want to hear anymore what I was praying

for.
Then, to my surprise, Domenico stood up to speak. “After investigation, 
the Fedeli have determined that Bella was seduced into apostasy by a 
servant at the conservatory named Giorgi,” he said. “Unfortunately, Giorgi 
fled sometime last night; rest assured, however, that he will be found and 
brought to justice. You all know Giorgi, so it may come as a surprise to you 
that he was an apostate. If Giorgi ever attempted to sway any of the rest of 
you to apostasy, please know that you are welcome to submit a deposition 
with Father Cassio and Mother Galeria; this will be used as evidence 
against him when he is caught.”
As soon as Domenico said that Giorgi had fled, relief swept through me 
like a warm wind. While a group of six conservatory girls would have stuck 
out like a six-toed foot in the area around Bascio, Giorgi would be able to 
disappear. There was nothing about him that was so unusual that the 
Fedeli would be able to identify him from a description. If they blamed 
Giorgi, but couldn’t find Giorgi, then the rest of us were—probably—safe.
“If you have anything to tell Father Cassio or Mother Galeria, please come 
by my quarters tonight,” Domenico said. “They will be leaving early 
tomorrow morning.”
Domenico sat down, and after a final prayer, the service ended. As we filed 
out, a bell rang—it was time for the evening meal.
Bella’s space at the table was painfully empty. Flavia and Celia sat a little 
closer together, trying to make it less obvious. I was too hungry to think 
about much of anything other than food. Knowing that the Fedeli were 
leaving had made the mood almost festive; the conversation around us was 
loud and boisterous, if still a little nervous. The soup had meat in it—

technically, this was a festival meal, but I suspected they hadn’t planned to 
give us meat until the Fedeli showed up. I was surprised that I was able to 
get it down.
After the evening meal, I took my violin and a candle to go practice. I had 
barely had time even to tune my instrument in the last few days, and I 
ached to spend some time playing. I was fairly certain that I didn’t need to 
convince Celia not to turn us all in, nor to convince Giula that she wasn’t 
going to die.
Besides, I wanted to mourn Bella alone.
As I closed the door of my practice room, I wished that I had the courage 
to play the Old Way funeral music. That was what Bella would have wanted
—a Redentore funeral, or the closest thing to it that I could give her. With 
the Fedeli still at the conservatory, though, I didn’t dare. Instead, I played 
some music that Bella had liked—first an achingly sad violin piece that I’d 
played in recital a few years earlier, then the tune of her favorite trumpet 
serenade. “Rachamin, Arka,” I whispered when I was done, very quietly, 
my eyes closed. “Rachamin, Gèsu.”
I remembered Bella’s fascination with the Wicked Stepmother song and 
plucked the tune gently on my violin.
 
 
I’ve come to wed your father but I want to make you mine.
If you’ll take me as your mother, you will find my faults are few.
I’ve brought a gift of honey, bright as sun and sweet as wine.
And as pure as all the love I hold inside my heart for you.

The door to my practice room slammed open, and I stared into Galeria’s 
furious face.
“How dare you!” she shouted.
For some reason, the first thing that came into my head was a terrible fear 
that she would throw my violin to the ground, as Cassio had thrown Bella’s 
trumpet. “Please don’t break my violin,” I said, backing up. “Just let me 
put it down, please.” All I could think was, the Lady told them that Bella 
was an apostate, and now she’s told them that I am, too, but I was too 
busy defending my violin to say anything incriminating.
“Where did you learn that song?” Galeria demanded.
It took me a moment to remember that I hadn’t been playing an Old Way 
song—I’d been playing the song about the poisoned honey. “It was all over 
the conservatory a few months ago,” I said. “I don’t remember whom I first 
heard it from.” Celia, I remembered a moment later. “We thought that the 
‘poisoned honey’ referred to a heresy— something that looked sweet, but 
would rot you from the inside. Some people thought that the Fedeli wrote 
the song.”
The fury on Galeria’s face had eased, and now she gave me what was 
doubtless intended as a reassuring smile. “No, daughter,” she said. “Your 
own innocence is clear, but that song doesn’t do justice to you. It was 
written by apostates, to turn people against the true faith. The Redentori 
believe that the Lady’s gift of magic is evil—like poisoned honey. That’s 
what the song is about.”
“I’m sorry,” I said. “I’ll never sing it again.”

“The Lady understands that you played it without malice,” Galeria said. 
She stepped forward, her eyes searching mine. I forced myself to meet her 
gaze.
“I can see that you’re afraid of me,” Galeria said.
I didn’t dare deny it. “Bella was a friend of mine,” I said.
“I see,” Galeria said. “Kneel, daughter.”
I knelt at her feet, and she clasped my head in her hands. Then she raised 
my chin so that I was looking up at her face, and her eyes were full of tears. 
“ ‘Innocence doesn’t need to hide,’ ” she quoted. “Daughter, the Lady 
assures me that your heart is as pure as Bella’s was black. Be at peace, and 
remember that the Lady loves you.” She raised me to my feet and left, 
closing the practice room door behind her.
I discovered that my hands were shaking too hard to play anymore 
tonight. I waited long enough to feel sure that she was gone, then packed 
up my violin and headed back to my room.
When I reached it, Mira wasn’t there. She might have been practicing, as 
I’d been, but I was struck with the sudden fear that she had run away from 
the conservatory. Her cloak was gone, and her violin. I knelt to look under 
her bed for personal belongings—there was a box under her bed, like the 
one where I kept letters from my parents. She wouldn’t leave without her 
letters, I thought.
Still, I couldn’t shake my fear that she’d vanished like Giorgi. Grabbing my 
cloak again, I went back out to the practice hall, but the halls were quiet. I 
tried the north practice hall next, crossing the courtyard and finding my 
way to the crumbling building beyond the chapel. I didn’t see the flicker of

candlelight, but it occurred to me that Mira might have feared that the 
Fedeli would see a candle and grow suspicious. I opened the door and 
stared into the cold darkness. “Mira?” I said.
There was no reply, but as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I could see a 
shape huddled on the floor.
“Mira?” I said again, and knelt beside her. It was Mira; I took her hand. I 
had expected her hand to be cold from the wind and the damp stone floor 
she lay on, but it was so hot I wondered if she was running a fever. I made 
a witch-light to see her face, and she cried out as if I’d burned her.
“Put it away,” she said, and I flicked away the light.
“Mira, do you need help getting back to our room?” I asked.
“No,” she said. “I need to stay here.”
“I’ll stay with you, then,” I said. I lay down on the floor beside Mira, 
wrapped in my cloak. Heat radiated from Mira’s body like a fire.
Mira was silent as I arranged myself beside her. Then— “Do you know why 
I left Cuore?” she asked.
“So that you could play the forbidden music?” I said.
She shook her head. “That’s why I came here, not why I left Cuore.”
“Why, then?” I asked.
“My grandmother died,” she said. “She was the person who’d taught me to 
play the violin. My parents sent her violin to me in Cuore, along with a 
letter. And that was when I knew I had to leave.”
“Was she executed by the Fedeli?” I asked.
“No,” Mira said. “She lived in Verdia, like my parents. She died from the 
famine.”

“I’m sorry,” I said.
“It wasn’t your fault,” she said. “It was my fault.”
I didn’t know how to answer that—how could the famine be her fault? So I 
touched her hot arm with my hand and said, “I was afraid you had run 
away.”
“You thought I’d lose my nerve now?” she asked. “After all this? If I were 
going to leave, I should have gone when we first saw that they’d come.”
“Galeria heard me playing the poisoned honey song,” I said. “She was 
furious. She told me that heretics wrote it to slander the Lady.”
“But she let you go?”
“I told her that we’d thought the poisoned honey referred to a heresy. She 
believed me.” I laughed bitterly. “She made me kneel, and then she told 
me that the Lady had told her that I was pure, just as the Lady told her 
that Bella was an apostate.”
“They’re liars,” Mira said. “The Lady doesn’t talk to Her followers.” She 
rolled away from me and coughed. The heat from her body was fading.
“Mira—”
“You should leave me alone,” Mira said. “I don’t deserve your loyalty.” She 
pulled herself to her knees and retched.
When she had finished, I drew her away from the pool of vomit, and 
covered her with her cloak. “Mira, you’re my friend. I’ll stay with you.”
Mira was silent for a while; then she retched again. Her body began to 
shake. The warmth she had radiated before was gone. “I can’t do this 
again,” she whispered.
I wrapped my arms around her, as I had in bed, and said nothing. I could

hear her weeping; then her body stiffened against my arms, and I realized 
that she was having a convulsion, as she had when she first arrived. I tried 
to hold her, but the convulsion wrenched her out of my grasp. When the 
convulsion ended, she slipped into unconsciousness, and I pulled her into 
my arms again.
“My fault,” she muttered suddenly a while later.
“No,” I said, and stroked her hair. “It’s not your fault.”
“I could have stopped them,” she said. “The Fedeli. I could have stopped 
them.”
“You would have been one against all of them—Galeria, Cassio, all their 
guards,” I said. “There wasn’t anything any of us could have done.”
“No,” Mira said. “When he drew the knife. I should have—” She broke off. 
“I can’t tell you,” she said. “You shouldn’t know.”
I clasped her tightly. “It wasn’t your fault.”
“I can’t do this again,” she said. “I won’t be able to let another friend die.”
“The Fedeli leave at dawn,” I said. “They won’t come back.”
Mira fell silent, then began to weep again. I pressed my hand against her 
wet cheek, wiping her tears away. “Mira,” I said.
“Don’t say it,” she said. “Whatever it was you were going to say, just don’t 
say it.”
So I waited until she was asleep again. The moon was up, and shining 
through the cracks in the walls enough that I could just see Mira’s face 
when I sat up. The warm flush had drained out of her face, leaving her as 
pale as polished bones. I touched her cold forehead with my lips; she 
didn’t wake.

“I know you don’t want me to bind myself to you, Mira,” I whispered. “But 
even if you don’t hear me, I want to tell you that I’m not going to leave 
you.” I crossed my forefingers. “Whatever you fear, I will face it with you. 
Whether we face Maledori or Fedeli, I’ll stand beside you. If it’s in my 
power, I’ll protect you.” I kissed my fingers, sealing the oath. Mira’s eyes 
never flickered.
“I love you, Mira,” I whispered.
I slept, toward the end of the night, my body tucked around Mira’s. I 
dreamed all night of the soldier I’d seen in the old practice hall before, and 
of Mira’s eyes, watching me across a vast chasm filled with fire.
At dawn, I peered out through a crack in the wall to see the Fedeli leaving. 
Once I was certain that they were gone, I went to stand in the courtyard, 
where Bella had died. It was the earliest dawn, and the courtyard was 
empty. As I started back toward the old practice hall, to see if Mira would 
wake for breakfast, something caught my eye.
Between two paving-stones, stained with blood, was a small wooden cross 
on a broken cord. Bella’s cross. I looked around quickly to see if anyone 
was watching, but the Fedeli had gone and the courtyard, in the cold dawn, 
was empty. I snatched it up and slipped it into the sleeve of my robe. Bella 
would have wanted me to have it, I thought, then went to wake Mira.

The rest of the winter passed too quietly. No one spoke of the Fedeli, and 
no one openly said Bella’s name. As the first heavy rainstorm turned the 
roads to impassable mud, Mira fidgeted and paced until I set aside my 
music and pulled her down to sit beside me. “The Fedeli can’t come back,” 
I said. “No one can travel in this.”
“But I can’t leave, either,” Mira said.
“Do you want to leave so badly?” I asked. My hand, clasping Mira’s, 
trembled slightly.
“I came here to play the forbidden music,” she said, dropping her voice 
even though we were alone. “To teach it. But after what happened ...” She 
turned her face away from me.
“Where would you go, if you left?” I asked.
“I don’t know,” she said. “Farther south, maybe. Back to my home village.”
“I thought you wanted to become a minstrel. That’s what you said, once.”
Mira glanced up at me with a faint smile. “Want to try to work out a 
minstrel style on the violin with me? Sing and play at the same time?”
“I can’t sing,” I said.
She rolled her eyes. “It’s really not as hard as Celia makes it out to be.”
“I know what a voice should sound like,” I said. “My voice doesn’t sound

like that.”
“Stand up,” Mira said, hopping off the bed. I stood, and she touched my 
back lightly. “Stand up straight.” I straightened. “Now, pretend I haven’t 
heard ‘The Wicked Stepmother’—and you’re the only person who can sing 
me the words.” She sat back down on the bed and looked at me 
expectantly.
I started to say that I really didn’t have a good singing voice—but Mira just 
waited, still smiling, so I took a deep breath and started the song.
 
 
I’ve come to wed your father but I want to make you mine.
If you’ll take me as your mother, you will find my faults are few.
I’ve brought a gift of honey, bright as sun and sweet as wine.
And as pure as all the love I hold inside my heart for you.
 
 
When I was done, my face was hot, and I stared down at the floor. “I don’t 
know why you say you can’t sing,” Mira said. I looked up, surprised, and 
she met my gaze with a smile that struck me like an arrow. “You have a 
lovely voice. All you need is to be able to accompany yourself with the 
violin.”
The violin worked reasonably well for a minstrel performance, as it turned 
out. We couldn’t tuck our chins down while singing, of course, and it took 
some practice, but we were able to work out a way to play and sing at the 
same time. The violin was louder than a lute, and two violins sounded

really good together. Mira and I started digging up old folk songs to play 
together—it wasn’t Old Way music, so we couldn’t get in trouble for it, but 
at least it was something different and a little strange. And the project 
seemed to dispel Mira’s restlessness, just a bit.
During the worst of the rains, we celebrated the birthday of Aelius, brother 
of Gaius. Gaius was the prophet who brought the Lady’s Gift of magery to 
the rest of us; Aelius was not a prophet, but he was honored by musicians 
because he had started to teach musicians to play in ensembles, and had 
created the Central Conservatory in Cuore. The legend said that he also 
created the first violin, though in the library I’d seen drawings of similar 
instruments that had predated Aelius. His birthday was not a sacred day, 
so we didn’t have to go to the chapel; instead, we had the day off from 
lessons and classes and threw a party in the meal hall.
Bella had always loved celebrating Aelius’s birthday. At the party, we 
played games—trying to name ensemble pieces from a line of harmony, or 
racing to play a tune named by the musical archivist. Bella had a superb 
memory and always won every game until the teachers disqualified her to 
give someone else a chance. This year, nobody felt much like playing 
anything.
When the rains stopped and the roads hardened again, the mail came. 
People scrutinized their letters in silence and compared notes privately 
later. Several villages had had visits from the Fedeli, and others, like 
Flavia’s family, had seen soldiers—hundreds of soldiers, marching south. 
None had seen Circle detachments. Everyone wondered the same thing—if 
we’re going to war with Vesuvia again, where are the mages? How can the 
army tight without magefire?

And why had the Fedeli come? They were driving out the Maledori that 
had caused the famine, some letters said. There was nothing to fear. Other 
letters were fearful or angry. There had been a burning, in one village, or 
so I heard.
The Fedeli had not come to Doratura, my home village, nor had my family 
heard these rumors. Instead, my mother wrote about a new ritual they did 
each week to honor the Lady and ensure the fertility of the land. Singing, 
with drums and dancing. This is an older way to honor the Lady, she 
wrote. Sometimes it’s the older ways that are the best. I shuddered, and 
added to my letter back: Be careful, all of you. The Fedeli came to the 
conservatory, and we found that they take a dim view of certain “older 
ways.”
At Equinox, we would celebrate Ritorno, the Lord’s return from His battle 
with the Maledori. Chastened by the visit from the Fedeli, the conservatory 
was planning an extensive and elaborate observance. I helped 
halfheartedly with the preparations, thinking of home—they would be 
planting the early crops, onions and wheat and beans. They’d celebrate 
Ritorno with a bonfire in the piazza, and rites to ask the Lady to bless the 
fields and the planting. On our first beautiful day, the week before the 
Equinox, I slung my violin over my shoulder—so that I could pretend to 
myself that I was going to practice—and made my way to the conservatory 
wall to watch the festival preparations in Bascio. I sat down on the wall 
and swung my legs to dangle into forbidden territory.
Two—no, three summers earlier, Bella and I slipped out of the 
conservatory one night on a dare. Bring us a pebble from the Bascio 
piazza. It had been Celia’s idea. Bella and I had jumped over the wall and

crept down the hill; the moon had been full, and we’d jumped at every 
noise, convinced that someone from the conservatory had seen us. We 
each grabbed a smooth pebble, white in the moonlight, and ran back to the 
conservatory, smothering our giggles.
Pushing down the grief that rose up into my throat, I stared down at a 
stray goat that was winding its way around the cottages of Bascio, filching 
stray vegetables. Someone spotted it and started beating it with a stick, 
shouting words I could almost catch. I wondered how Doratura would look 
from this perspective. Probably much the same.
I tried to remember when I had last been down to Bascio. Seven months 
ago, I decided, shortly before Mira arrived—for my new boots.
I opened my violin case, but couldn’t bring myself to play. Tucked in with 
the extra gut and the rosin, though, was a tiny clay bird whistle, which my 
brother Donato had made for me while we were walking to the 
conservatory. He’d tried to make it so that I could use it to tune my violin, 
and it hadn’t really worked, but it had a pure sweet sound, and I blew 
through it gently to pick out the tune to the song about the poisoned honey.
I heard a twig snap and turned around; Mira had crept up behind me. She 
also had her violin slung over her shoulder. I started to swing my legs back 
to the legal side of the wall, and she laughed. “Don’t get up on my 
account,” she said, and sat down beside me. She gestured to the whistle. 
“You’ve been hiding one of your talents.”
“Not really,” I said. “A bird whistle isn’t exactly a flute. My brother Donato 
made this for me.”
“Can I see?” Mira asked. I handed it to her, and she blew on it, a little too 
hard; the sound was harsh. She laughed and handed it back. “Well, it takes

some sort of talent, anyway.”
“Just a little practice,” I said, and put it away. I would make a whistle for 
Mira, I decided; not clay, that would be too hard to get on the conservatory 
grounds. I’d carve a wooden whistle for her. We looked down at Bascio for 
a few minutes. The troublesome goat had been corralled and tethered to a 
post, where it had started to chew on its rope again.
“Are you homesick today?” Mira asked.
“No,” I said.
“Letters make a lot of people homesick,” she said.
“I’m feeling restless,” I admitted. “I wish I were graduating this spring, 
instead of next spring—I’m ready to get out of here.”
“Where do you want to go?”
“Today? Anywhere that isn’t the Verdiano Rural Conservatory.”
Mira flashed me a smile. “We should go on a trip,” she said. “Right now.”
“Where? Bascio?”
“No, farther than that. We should run away. You’ve got your violin with 
you, I’ve got mine. What more do we need? We could just jump over the 
wall and go.” She grinned broadly. “What do you say?”
“Keep talking. You might convince me.”
“We could play at taverns,” she said, “the two of us together. Those songs 
we’ve been learning—we sound good.”
“I don’t know,” I said. “Minstrel life is hard. Never knowing if we’d sleep in 
a bed or under a bush—never knowing if we’d eat or go hungry—”
“We’d eat,” she said. “We’d sleep at the inns where we played. Think, 
Eliana! Freedom. Adventure. We could see the whole world together.” She

clasped my hand and fell silent, looking into my eyes, and I realized that 
she wasn’t joking.
My heart started knocking in my ears as I returned her stare. I realized 
that I was holding my breath. The warmth of her hand felt like it was 
scorching mine; my grip tightened. Leave the conservatory? I thought. It 
was a crazy idea. But—
There was a crash from behind us and we both whirled, leaping to our feet. 
It was Giula, looking sheepish. “Sorry,” she said. “Mira, your teacher sent 
me looking for you. You’re late for your lesson.”
Mira smacked herself on the forehead. “I can’t believe I did that.” She 
turned and whispered in my ear, “Think about it.” Giula gave me an 
apologetic look and followed Mira back up the hill.
I broke a small branch from one of the trees that grew along the wall, and 
started carving a whistle for Mira, thinking about her offer as I let the sun 
soak into my skin. What if she truly was planning to leave? I’d go with her, 
I thought. If I had to. But I preferred to stay, as long as I could persuade 
Mira to stay with me; I wanted to finish my last year at the conservatory, 
audition for ensembles, and see how I did. It occurred to me that Mira had 
said repeatedly that she didn’t ever want to go back to Cuore, and of course 
I’d be auditioning for ensembles there . . . Well, there was no guarantee 
that I would get into any ensemble, let alone one of the ensembles in 
Cuore. I’d worry about it if it happened.
I blew into the whistle to test it, and was pleasantly surprised by the sweet, 
clear note. Mira would like it, I thought. I would go anywhere, if it meant 
being with Mira. Or rather, if the alternative meant not being with Mira. 
I slipped the whistle into my violin case and started walking back to the

room we shared.
Mira wasn’t there, so I left the whistle under her pillow, then leaned out 
the window to stare up again at the clear blue sky. I need to get out, I 
thought, just for a day. Maybe I can convince the Dean I need new boots. 
No, a new cloak. I fingered the fabric thoughtfully.
The next day, giddy with my temporary freedom, I managed to keep 
myself from skipping down the road from the conservatory to the village. 
The Dean had looked over my shabby cloak and given me coin and 
permission to go get myself a new one. The cloak I wore had been cut with 
a generous hem that could be let out as I grew, but no one had known I’d 
grow two inches taller than most men. It was too short for me, and 
wearing badly at the edges. I slipped a bit in the mud as I reached the 
village; it had rained the night before, leaving the stones of the Bascio 
piazza glittering in the sunshine.
The village seamstress was a tiny, aged widow named Marietta; she lived 
alone in a cottage filled with bolts of gray cloth. Outside her cottage, rose 
bushes were coming back to life; in the summer, the walls of her cottage 
were covered with a cloak of red flowers. “How old are you now, dear?” 
Marietta asked me as she climbed up onto a chair to measure the breadth 
of my shoulders. “Just hold the measure there, now, on your shoulder,” 
she added, and let the tape fall, climbing off the chair to check my height.
“I’m sixteen years old,” I said.
“So almost ready for an orchestra.” She clucked her tongue. “Well, you’ll 
be wanting another new cloak soon enough, then. It’s too bad I can’t give 
you something a bit more stylish now.”
“Can I see your other fabrics?” I asked.

Marietta smiled. “Surely. There’s no harm in looking, is there?”
The teachers, and the students leaving to play in orchestras, bought their 
clothes from this woman as well, and in her back room she had a fine 
selection of dyed wool flannel. “I think this one is my favorite,” I said, 
fingering a swatch of dark red.
Marietta clucked her tongue again. “Tisn’t quite the color for you, dear; 
you’d do better in a dark blue. Still, not too bad.” She held it up. “Not bad 
at all; I’d have thought you too pale for the red, but you’d carry it off, 
anyway.” She sighed and put it away. “Next year, yes? In the meantime ... I 
think I actually have a cloak on hand that might fit you. Made it for a boy 
who got himself into trouble and had to leave the conservatory, and I was 
left with the stock.” She fetched it from her back room. “Here now, try that 
on.”
Much to my disappointment, the cloak fit perfectly. “Thank you,” I said.
Marietta saw my wistfulness, and gave me a smile. “Now then, you’ll be off 
on your own soon enough, won’t you? What’s an extra trip to Bascio when 
you’ll have the world?” I tried to smile back. She patted my hand and said, 
“Just one more moment.”
She vanished into the back room again and returned with a strip of the 
dark red cloth. “Since I had the cloak anyway, I’ll give you a discount,” she 
said, “and with the difference you can pay for this. It’s just a scrap, but it’s 
big enough for a scarf, or even a sash.” I made a token protest, but she 
insisted. “Just don’t let that Dean of yours see it, and if he does, don’t tell 
him where you got it!” I promised, and she folded it neatly and tucked it 
inside the cloak.

Despite being denied a second trip to the village, I was in a fair mood when 
I returned. Mira would like the scarf, I was certain, so I headed back to our 
room, whistling one of the folk songs we’d been learning. I swung open the 
door.
Witchlight flared, blindingly bright. I leapt back, but hands seized my 
arms and jerked me inside. The door slammed shut behind me. I blinked 
in the dazzling light, staring into the rigid face of the man who had 
grabbed my arms. He wore the uniform of the Circle Guard. Beyond him, I 
could see four more men in the same uniform, seated on the beds, 
crossbows leveled.
At the very end of my bed sat an older man in a scarlet robe, with chill 
yellow eyes. He rose, his lips tight, his head tilted back to stare down at me 
even though I was taller than he was. “It’s the roommate,” he said, and sat 
back down. “Bring her here.” He indicated the floor directly in front of him.
“Sit,” the guard said, shoving me toward the man in scarlet. “And be 
silent.”
My knees shaking, I sank to the floor. I could hear my heart pounding. 
With a flick, the man in scarlet dispelled the witchlight. We waited, in 
silence, staring at the door in the fading daylight.
Mira. They had to be here for Mira. Why? My first thought was that 
somehow, they’d found out about Mira teaching the Old music—but these 
men were not Fedeli. I could hear the man in scarlet behind me—his 
breathing was calm and even, like this was something he did every day. 
Who was he, with his white-hot witchlight? He wore no uniform. Was he a. 
mage from the Circle, all the way down here? What could Mira have 
possibly done that would require the Circle to come for her? The man

shifted slightly; I heard the rustle of movement. If I had ever met someone 
who could be a Maledore in the guise of a mortal, he was it. I had only 
looked at him for an instant, but his yellow eyes were burned into my 
mind. I shuddered, and felt his hand close briefly over my shoulder like a 
claw, ensuring that I wouldn’t move again. Maybe this is a dream,
I thought, but the growing ache in my legs from sitting still assured me 
that I wasn’t sleeping.
Time passed; the room went from dim to dark as the last of the light faded. 
I tried to guess the passage of time from the noises outside. It must be 
almost time for the evening meal; Mira would be back soon.
We heard footsteps approaching the door. I felt a gloved hand cup my 
throat. My stomach lurched with the desire to escape the touch of his 
hand, but I bit my lip and remained still. “Be silent,” the man in scarlet 
whispered. I could hear the soldiers tense, then rise. The door started to 
swing open.
“RUN!” I screamed to Mira, and the man clapped his hand over my mouth.
“That was very stupid,” he said into my ear—but Mira still stood in the 
doorway, in the blinding flare of witchlight. She stepped inside, and the 
door swung closed to trap her. The man released me and shoved me aside 
to stand up. “Hello, Miriamne,” he said.
Mira leaned back against the door, eyeing the man with defiance and 
disgust. “Hello, Liemo,” she said.
There was a long pause. Mira gently set her violin down on the floor. “You 
certainly brought enough guards. Were you planning to have them drag 
me bodily back to Cuore?”
“Miriamne—”

“Mira,” she snapped.
The man winced. “I’ve come to tell you that you can come back.”
“Really.”
“Miriamne, we understand. You were under strain, ten times over—just 
being the youngest full member of the Circle in ten generations would have 
been enough. The death of your grandmother—we understand why you 
left. Why you felt you had to stay away, hide from us here. But you can 
come back, Miriamne—your chair is waiting for you.”
“Mira,” she said. “My name is Mira, and I will never sit in the Circle 
again.” My head was spinning. Mira? Circle? The girl who couldn’t— 
wouldn’t— even summon witchlight? I stared at her; her eyes were locked 
on Liemo’s. My mouth had gone dry. Would she have ever told me? I felt 
like I should feel betrayed—or horrified—or frightened, but all I could 
think was that I wished we’d run away the other afternoon, when she 
suggested it.
“Don’t be hasty,” Liemo said. “I know you need time to think—”
“I made my decision before I left Cuore.”
Liemo’s voice softened. “Miriamne ... Mira. Don’t you miss magery?” With 
a flick of his wrist, his witchlight flared brighter, danced in his hand like 
flames in a wind. I could see Mira flinch. “The energy drawn by the full 
Circle with you as the focus ...” His voice dropped to a whisper. “Miriamne, 
don’t you miss it?” He held out his hand, as if offering her the globe of 
light.
When Mira spoke, her voice was a whisper and her face was lowered. 
“More than you could imagine. I think of it every day—every time I see

witchlight, or see someone start a fire. I remember the elation—the rush of 
power flying through my body. I miss it more than you could imagine—” 
Her breath caught. “That is why I don’t summon witchlight. That is why I 
will never go back.” I saw her straighten her shoulders and look Liemo in 
the eyes. “Liemo. We can talk all night, but I will not change my mind.”
“Perhaps.” Liemo’s voice was almost too soft to hear. “You are one of the 
strongest, Mira. One of the best.”
Silence.
“We need you.”
Mira’s eyes widened. “I don’t care how much you think you need me. I 
would burn Cuore to the ground myself before I’d help to kill more of the 
land! You know we’re the cause of the famine. You know it, even as you 
mouth the lie that the Vesuviano army sowed our land with salt. Our 
magefire drained the Verdiani borderlands of every drop of energy they 
had. We killed the land. We caused the famine. It’s our fault, Liemo.”
I sucked in my breath. Magery caused the famine? The Circle—our 
protectors—had killed us? Killed Bella’s sister? I felt a pain in my chest like 
a knife, and I stared at Mira with blinding anger—but whether it was at the 
Circle for what they’d done, or at Mira for keeping their secret from me, I 
wasn’t sure.
“I’m sorry about your grandmother . . .” Liemo looked down, almost 
ashamed. Almost.
Mira shook her head. “I don’t care if you’re sorry. I won’t share magery 
with you again, Liemo. I would rather die.”
There was silence. Then Liemo spoke, very softly.

FIRES OF THE FAITHFUL - NAOMI KRITZER
“I am sorry, Miriamne. But we truly do need you.”
The room went dark. Hands seized my arms; someone stuffed a cloth into 
my mouth to stifle my scream. Light flared again. I was dragged up against 
the door. There was horror in Mira’s eyes as she struggled against the 
soldiers who now held her fast. I tried desperately—uselessly—to break 
free, or to spit out the gag.
The last soldier was cocking his crossbow.
“I am sorry, my dear,” Liemo said to me. “But you did try to cry out, when 
I had told you not to.” He turned to Mira. “It would be immoral, of course, 
to kill an innocent simply to test your resolve.” He nodded toward the 
soldiers holding me. “Violinist? Left hand, I think.”
I screamed; the sound caught in the gag. I tried again to tear free. One 
soldier held me against the door; the other held my left arm, palm out, flat 
against the wall.
“You can stop this at any time, Mira. I will give you a few moments to 
think about it.”
I tried again to tear free. No, not my hand, not my hand—
“Bowman, fire.”
I heard the snap of the bowstring and tried to brace— my eyes followed the 
blur of the bolt—
—and, in a flash, it was gone.
Mira’s hands were outstretched as if she were praying to the Lady, and 
there was a wild, terrifying ecstasy on her face. She stood a moment more, 
frozen in silence. Then she fell limp to the floor. The soldiers released me, 
and my own knees gave way. I tore the gag out of my mouth.

“Come, Miriamne,” I heard Liemo say. “We’re going.”
“No,” I said. I tried to stand, bracing myself against the wall, but my legs 
were still shaking too hard. My mouth was almost too dry to speak. “Mira, 
don’t go with him!”
Mira held one hand over her eyes, and her shoulders were shaking. She 
didn’t answer.
I couldn’t take her arm, so I grabbed the edge of her robe. “Mira, you don’t 
have to go with him!” Liemo gestured, and one of the guards shoved me 
away from her. “Mira! Look at me! Please, Mira!” Liemo was lifting her to 
her feet; she straightened slightly.
“You see, Miriamne?” Liemo murmured. “You are one of us, after all.” He 
smiled at me, a patronizing, triumphant smile that knotted my stomach. 
He had an extra cloak, made of a fine black wool, which he flung over her 
shoulders, covering the drab gray robe. “Let’s go.”
As the last of the soldiers left my room, I found that my legs would hold 
me again and I stumbled to my feet. The hallway outside was empty. 
Liemo was striding down the stairs, Mira following in his wake; I stumbled 
down behind them.
The other girls from the dormitory were clustered at the bottom of the 
stairs, just inside the door, a teacher standing watch over them. Someone 
must have told the Dean to keep people out of the way. “What’s 
happening?” Giula asked. “Who are they? Where are they taking Mira?”
I shook my head. Seeing how hard I was shaking, Giula offered me her 
shoulder for support as I stumbled after them. The teacher reached to stop 
us, but I brushed him away, and the rest of the students followed me 
silently as I ran out the door.

“Mira!” I shouted again. “Mira, don’t leave.”
“I don’t understand,” Giula said, flushed with frustration and worry. “Who 
are they?”
“The Circle,” I said. “Mira is a member of the Circle.”
“What? That’s impossible, she’s not a mage, she doesn’t even summon 
witchlight.”
“Doesn’t summon witchlight. Not can’t. Won’t.”
“I don’t understand,” Giula wailed again, almost losing her own footing as 
I stumbled. Someone steadied me from behind. I realized that people were 
spilling out of the buildings—students, then teachers, staring bewildered at 
Mira and the guards.
Eight black horses pawed the ground in the courtyard. Liemo had brought 
an extra for Mira. Miriamne. He had said the name like a curse, like a 
threat. They were mounting the horses. “Mira!” I cried out.
This time, she met my eyes, looking down from her horse. Her face was 
anguished, choked with despair, drowning, and I reached out the last way 
I knew how.
“Rachatnin, Arka,” I sang—the words to the healing song. “Rachamin, 
Gèsu.”
Giula, next to me, clasped my hand. “Refuya, Arka,” she sang. “Refuya, 
Gèsu.” Behind us, Flavia took up the song, as well. Then someone clasped 
my other hand—Celia. Looking straight at Mira, she took a deep breath 
and joined the song.
In the hush of the crowd, the courtyard rang with the voices; our sharp 
rhythm echoed off the walls. Mira closed her eyes, and for a moment she

almost seemed comforted. Liemo started and stared at us, with an 
expression almost like fear in his eyes. Then he took the bridle of Mira’s 
horse and spurred his horse to a gallop, fleeing us, fleeing the school. The 
soldiers wheeled and followed. Slowly, our singing died.
My knees gave way again, and I fell to the stones of the courtyard.

“I’m leaving,” I said.
Domenico looked at my travel sack and the red wool knotted as a belt 
around my waist. “You aren’t thinking of going after her, are you?”
“No,” I said. “I want to go home.”
“I know you’ve always hoped to play in Cuore,” Domenico said. “Don’t 
think that you wouldn’t have other options.”
I shrugged. “As a scholarship student, I am supported by the Circle.” I 
paused for a moment to steady my voice. “I don’t want their money. And
—” I paused again. “I want to tell my family what caused the famine.”
Domenico nodded slowly. “Be careful,” he said. “There were people 
executed last fall in Cuore for their heresy against the Lady’s Gift.”
I nodded and started to leave.

“Wait,” Domenico said. He took a small leather pouch out of his desk 
drawer and dropped it into my hand; it had a meager but solid weight. I 
started to refuse, but he closed my hand over it. “You’ll need this to get 
home,” he said. “You’d have gotten a stipend next year, anyway.”
“Thank you,” I said.
“Tuck it well out of sight when you pass through cities,” Domenico said.
“I will,” I said. I started to leave again, then turned back. “Did you know?” 
I asked.
“No,” Domenico said. “We all knew that Mira had never been a 
seminarian, but we also knew that she paid in coin. No one wanted to look 
too closely.” He rubbed his forehead with the heel of his hand. “Do you 
think we should have tried to find out?”
I felt the tears I’d been holding back rise to my eyes. “No,” I whispered. “I 
just think she should have hidden better.”
Domenico turned his face away. I started again for the door, but Domenico 
reached out and pulled me quickly into a rough hug. He whispered 
something in the Old Tongue, and then let me go. “Be careful, Eliana,” he 
said. “I don’t want anything bad to happen to you.”
I left Domenico’s study before he could make me cry again.
An hour later, I had food and a blanket; my spare robe was tucked into my 
sack, along with the letters from my family and a few other personal 
things, and my violin was slung across my shoulder. I took one other thing
—the box of Mira’s letters. I told myself that I had to take them so that no 
one else would find them. Her violin was gone. I checked under Mira’s 
pillow; the whistle was gone, too.

It was almost noon when I shouldered my pack and turned toward the 
gate. The road sloped down the hill, past the dorm, the chapel, and then 
the north practice hall. I stepped briefly inside the north practice hall, 
standing in the ensemble hall where I’d played the Old Way songs with the 
others, and where I’d sat with Mira those two nights when she was ill. 
Sunshine filtered in through the cracks in the walls, illuminating the one 
fresco that hadn’t crumbled away. I studied the image—a terrified-looking 
young man clutching a faint glow to his chest. I assumed it was Gaius with 
the Lady’s Gift, though again it seemed a strange depiction of Gaius. “You 
had it right, though,” I whispered. “You were right to be afraid. Damn you 
for bringing us that sort of gift at all.”
Back outside, I heard someone shout, “Eliana, wait!”
I turned to see Giula running toward me. She carried a pack as well, and I 
could hear the jingle of a coin pouch from somewhere under her robe as 
she ran across the courtyard. “I’m coming with you.”
“Giula, don’t be—”
“I’m coming with you,” she said. “My family deserves to know about what 
caused the famine, just as yours does. Even if you don’t care for company, 
would you leave me to travel alone?”
“You’d be a fool to leave,” I said.
“And you aren’t?” she asked.
“You don’t have my reasons.”
Giula shook her head, stubborn. “I have my own reasons.” She shifted her 
pack on her shoulder. “Our villages lie in the same direction. I’m coming 
with you.”

“You’d better not slow me down,” I said.
She snorted. “You’re just as soft as I am. Don’t worry. I won’t slow you 
down.”
The brown dust road wound out of Bascio and around the curve of the hill, 
and then the conservatory was hidden from view. Bascio’s silver-green 
olive groves spread out before us, with the deeper green of evergreen forest 
beyond.
The sky overhead was blue, fading to white at the horizon. We could just 
make out the next village, rising on a hill far ahead. Maybe we could walk 
there by evening.
Giula and I sat down under a tree after what we reckoned to be about an 
hour. It probably hadn’t been that much; wishful thinking was making the 
sun seem lower in the sky. “I think my boots don’t fit right,” Giula said. 
“They’re giving me blisters.”
I was starting to get blisters, too, but I wasn’t going to admit it. “You’d just 
better not slow me down,” I said again.
“Tell me when you’re ready to start walking again, and I’ll be ready.” Giula 
rubbed her shoulders. “My violin never seemed this heavy before.”
“I’m ready,” I said, standing up, and Giula groaned and pushed herself up, 
bracing her back against the tree we’d been sitting under.
“Eliana?” Giula asked as we started walking again. “When did you realize 
that Mira was a member of the Circle?”
“Yesterday,” I said. “When they came for her.”
“I still can’t believe it,” Giula said. “Why did she leave with them, if she 
hated them so much?”

“I don’t know,” I said. I brushed at my eyes. “After she used magery, she 
just folded in on herself.”
“What happened in your room?” she asked.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” I said, but Giula looked so sad and hurt 
when I said that, I hunched my shoulders and gave her a brief version.
“I still don’t understand,” she said when I had finished.
“I don’t either.”
“You must have known more than any of us,” Giula said. “She was your 
best friend.”
“I knew that she’d never been a priestess,” I said. “That’s all.”
Giula gave me a look of hurt surprise—that I would have known, and not 
told her—and I looked away.
“Magery causing the famine,” Giula said, when we paused to rest again. 
“Do you suppose that’s what the Wicked Stepmother song was about?”
I thought about it for a moment. “The stepmother would be the Lady, I 
suppose. The poisoned honey kills each child—” I blinked, and counted 
verses quickly. “Each child represents one of the provinces,” I said. “You’re 
right. That is what it’s about.”
Giula laughed shakily. “Whoever wrote the song sure didn’t want anyone 
figuring that out.”
“They wanted a song that people would be able to sing,” I said, thinking of 
Domenico’s warning about the people executed for slandering the Lady. “I 
bet it spread a long way before the Fedeli figured it out.”
“It’s too bad I didn’t think of it before we left,” Giula said. “I bet Flavia 
would have liked to know that.”

“It doesn’t matter,” I said. Isolated at the conservatory, it hardly mattered 
whether Flavia knew or not.
As the afternoon light faded, we stopped to ask for hospitality at a 
farmhouse. A big bearded man threw the door open wide. “Welcome, 
strangers,” he said. “You’ve picked a good night to stay with us.”
“Why?” I asked.
“It’s the night of the planting festival. Come in and rest your feet for a 
while. The boys are building a bonfire in the piazza. We can join them once 
it’s dark.”
A festival celebration was the last thing I wanted that night, but it was too 
late to go back to the last village. And besides, that would have been rude. 
The village’s name was Bosco. The planting festival was one of the not-
quite church-sponsored festivals that so many villages had, asking for the 
Lord and Lady’s blessings on the just-planted crops.
Our host’s name was Persco. He led us to the piazza as night fell, 
enthusiastically introducing us to his neighbors. Wine flowed freely, and 
we were quickly made to feel welcome.
“Hey,” a young woman said to me, gripping my hand and drawing me to 
my feet. “The dancing’s starting.”
“I have blisters—” I said.
“It’s easy, don’t worry,” she said, pulling Giula to her feet as well. She led 
us over to a circle of young women. The older women—mothers and wives, 
I suspected—surrounded our circle and sang for us, clapping. “Blessed 
Lord. Blessed Lady. Send us sun. Send us rain. Send us children, send us 
husbands. Blessed Lord, Blessed Lady.” I listened intently. The words were

new—but the tune was an Old Way melody, I was certain. I wondered if 
the Fedeli had skipped this village, or if it just hadn’t occurred to them that 
they were dancing to the Old music.
“Come on,” the girl next to me said—I still didn’t know her name. She 
pulled me to the right, and I stumbled as the dance started. I craned my 
neck to stare down at her feet, trying to match my movements to hers. 
Giula followed behind me, even more clumsily.
“Right-behind. Right-behind,” the girl said as we stepped around the 
circle. “It’s easy. Just run in the right direction. ” That was easy enough, 
and I started listening to the music instead of watching the dancers. “Now 
in,” the girl said abruptly, and I was lost again. She hauled me along 
unsympathetically, two steps toward the center of the circle, then back out. 
Everyone else seemed to know the dance; Giula and I were the only odd 
ones out. I tried to follow along, clumsy and off the beat. At least I hadn’t 
stepped on anyone’s foot yet.
“I’m just getting in the way,” I said.
“No, you’re not,” the girl insisted. “It’s easy. Now to the right again.”
Following along now, I felt a bit better. The dance was sinuous and 
hypnotic, with the scores of young women stepping in unison around the 
circle. Dancing in Bascio had always looked a bit more free-form. Giula 
was catching on more quickly than I was, smiling as she spun through the 
circle like a spindle of thread.
“Good dancing!” the girls around me said encouragingly when the dance 
ended. They clasped my arms and passed me a wineskin.
“Do you think this is all right, Eliana?” Giula whispered. “The music—the 
Fedeli—”

The girl who had brought us into the dance overheard Giula. “The words 
honor the Lady,” she said. “How could it not be all right?”
Giula ducked her head.
“Go sit down if you want,” the girl said, and Giula withdrew timidly. 
“What’s your name?” the girl asked me.
“Eliana. Yours?”
“Tercia.” She gave me an easy smile and tipped her head toward the circle. 
“Let’s go dance some more.” Despite Giula’s worries, she rose eagerly to 
dance when she realized boys would be dancing too, this time.
A circle of men and women danced around the fire next. The village 
priestess threw rose incense into the bonfire, and the smoke billowed out 
sweet and sticky over our dancing. None of the dances were terribly hard, 
once you had the rhythm right. “Just keep on the beat and go in the right 
direction,” Tercia said, and my mistaken steps didn’t seem to interrupt the 
dance. Finally my feet hurt too much to continue, and I sat down at the 
edge of the circle, Giula dropping out as well to sit beside me.
“Hello,” a young man’s voice said. I looked up. Two boys, one fair and one 
dark, stood looking down at us.
“Hi,” Giula said, looking up with a shy smile. I averted my eyes nervously 
and said nothing. They both grinned at Giula; she was prettier than me, 
anyway.
“What’s your name?” the dark-haired one asked her.
“Giula,” she said, tucking her chin down and looking up past her lashes. 
“What’s yours?”
“Marco. What’s your friend’s name? She’s acting shy.”

“Her name’s Eliana.”
My cheeks flamed. I couldn’t bring myself to look up, although I knew that 
the fairer-haired boy was still looking at me. My shyness was ridiculous, 
which only embarrassed me more. If I’d stayed home, I would probably be 
married by now. Listening to Giula giggling, I half-wished I’d tried flirting 
a few times. I didn’t even know what I was supposed to say to a boy.
“Eliana? Hello, Eliana.” The fair boy’s deep voice sounded almost taunting. 
I gave him a quick glance up and a tight smile. He was handsome enough, 
in a freckled sort of way. “Nice to meet you.”
“Hello,” I said. I was trying hard not to sound nervous, and I realized as 
soon as the word was out that I sounded hostile instead.
“My name’s Gino,” the fair boy said. He sat down close beside me; I fought 
the urge to edge away. “Are you from the conservatory?”
“Yes,” I said.
“We just left today,” Giula said.
“We thought so,” Gino said. “Because of your clothes.” Giula laughed and 
tilted her head so that her short-cropped curls spilled over her shoulder. 
“Where are you going?” he asked.
“Home,” Giula said. “We live south of here.”
The boys’ faces grew sober. “Are you sure you want to go there?” Marco 
asked. “Most people are trying to leave.” He caught her arm, gently. 
“You’re better off up here.”
Now Giula ducked her head. “I have to go back.” She sighed, and looked at 
me, but I stared at the ground. “I have to.”
There was a nervous pause. Then Giula gave Marco one of her sweet smiles

that showed her dimples. “But not until tomorrow,” she said, and looked 
up at him, doe-eyed.
As Giula flirted with Marco, Gino slipped his arm around my shoulders. I 
froze rigid under his elbow, and after a moment he withdrew his arm 
awkwardly. “Are you enjoying the festival?” he asked me.
“I’m a bit tired,” I said, and he nodded, looking relieved. After a few 
minutes, he excused himself to find someone else to flirt with; I looked 
around to find that Giula and Marco had slipped away. Gone to honor the 
Lady, no doubt. I wondered if she’d come back here if she got pregnant, 
and wed Marco.
From the other side of the fire, another boy was looking me over. I felt my 
cheeks flame again and looked down, then slipped back into the shadow of 
one of the cottages. It was too early to go back to Persco’s house; he would 
be dancing here for hours yet. I was tired and wanted to sleep, but mainly I 
wanted to dodge the advances of the local boys.
I watched the piazza from my shadowed corner as couples paired off. The 
bonfire was burning down; Persco and some of the other men threw more 
wood on it. The girls were still dancing, but their dance was faster now, 
and their feet moved in a complicated pattern of steps that I was certain 
I’d never be able to follow. Watching Tercia’s intent face as she 
concentrated on the dance, I was suddenly reminded of Mira; the 
wrenching pain in my stomach took me by surprise. I decided to go for a 
walk, away from the piazza and the boys and Tercia and the dancing. As 
long as I walked slowly I wouldn’t hurt my feet any worse.
I took the path out to the new-plowed fields, lighting my way with 
witchlight and keeping my eyes on the path. There would be couples out in 
file:///C|/Downloads/Kritzer,%20Naomi%20-%20Eliana%...Eliana%2001]%20-%20Fires%20of%20the%20Faithful.html (136 of 400)08/02/2006 11:47:46

the fields, honoring the Lady, and I had no wish to watch. The path led 
over a hill, with an olive grove beyond. As I reached the crest of the hill, I 
heard something—the beat of a drum. Wham. Wham. Wham. Wham. 
Somebody banishing the Maledori? I listened for a moment and heard the 
unmistakable rhythm of an Old Way song.
The drumbeat was coming from over the next hill. I stepped off the path 
and let my witchlight go out, picking my way quietly through the olive 
grove. The path led up a steep slope; I crept to the top of that hill and lay 
down on the damp earth, resting my chin on my arms as I looked down at 
the people below. They were also dancing, but the words they were singing 
were not to the Lady.
“Arka, v’Bara, v’nehora kadosha. Arka, v’Bara, v’nehora kadosha.” The 
chant was low and breathy. I didn’t recognize the tune.
There were perhaps twenty dancers in the circle, both men and women, 
with a violinist and a drummer in the center. The violinist wasn’t very 
good; he kept falling behind the beat and having to skip a note or two to 
catch up. The dance was simple, not too different from one of the dances 
I’d done earlier. Moving left: skip, slide-skip, slide-skip, slide-skip. Then 
right: skip, slide-skip, slide-skip, slide-skip. “Arka,” skip, “v’Bara,” skip, 
“v’nihora,” skip, “kadosha.”
I caught my breath, realizing what I was watching. Dancing, I thought. Of 
course. The Redentore music had always made me want to dance. But the 
Fedeli. Didn’t the Fedeli come here, as they came so many other places? 
How did they keep this secret?
The dance stopped and one of the women from the circle stepped forward. 
She signaled, and in unison each person knelt to touch the ground where

they stood, then rose and crossed themselves. “B’shem Arka, v’barah, 
v’nehora kadosha,” the woman said, and everyone murmured, “Amen.”
She continued in the Old Tongue, but I couldn’t catch individual words. 
Everyone in the circle had clearly done this many times—they crossed 
themselves, knelt, and stood on cue. The woman—priestess?—leading the 
service raised her palms to the sky as if she were praying to the Lady, then 
gripped them into fists and pulled them down through the air.
One of the others from the circle stepped in to the center and picked up a 
white bundle from beside the violin player. The priestess lifted off the 
white cloth, revealing a silver platter with a chalice and a loaf of bread. She 
took the bread in one hand and the chalice in the other, and lifted them to 
the sky. “Iyt gufay,” she said, in a clear voice that rang across the misty 
field. “Iyt damay. Achal. Ashti. V’chaya ad alam-almaya.”
“Amen,” the others in the circle said, and crossed themselves.
The priestess took a sip from the chalice, then set it down and broke off a 
piece of the bread.
Behind me, in the olive grove, I heard the unmistakable high-pitched peal 
of Giula’s flirtatious laughter.
The dancers heard it, too, and froze. “Scatter,” the priestess hissed, and the 
dancers melted into the shadowed fields. The priestess hesitated a 
moment longer, pouring out the wine onto the ground where the violinist 
had stood. “B’shemah,” she said. She looked up, and for a moment I 
thought she saw me; she looked straight in my direction. Then she 
followed the rest into the darkness.
“Giula,” a boy’s voice called from the olive grove. “Where’d you go?”
“I’m right here, Marco,” Giula said. She giggled again, then shrieked;

Marco must have found her. Turning quietly, I could see them in the olive 
grove. Marco reached to circle Giula’s waist with his hands, and she 
dodged aside with another giggle, running over the crest of the hill and 
down to where the dancers had been. “I’m sure this isn’t the way back to 
the village,” Giula said.
Marco slid carefully down the hill after her. “What makes you think that 
was where we were going?” he asked. He drew her toward him and dipped 
his face down to kiss her.
Giula pulled away briefly, still teasing him, then kissed him back. Marco 
dropped his cloak to the ground, spreading it out, and reached to loosen 
the drawstring at the neck of Giula’s robe.
This was exactly the sort of thing I had wanted to avoid watching. I stood 
up quietly to head back through the olive grove and met Persco on the 
path.
“What are you doing out here?” Persco asked.
“I—” The explanation was too long to get into. “I went for a walk,” I said.
Persco gave me a careful smile. “I’m heading home now, if you’re ready for 
bed.”
“I am,” I said, and fell into step beside him. “I don’t know if Giula’s coming 
back tonight.”
Persco laughed lightly. “The door stays open on festival nights. Giula can 
follow in her own sweet time or watch the sunrise with Marco, if she 
prefers.”
I trailed Persco back out to his house, and he made up a bed for me by the 
hearth. “Sleep well,” he said. I fell asleep quickly, but roused several times

during the night as the door opened and closed. I woke at dawn to find 
Giula curled up next to me. Persco’s wife was awake and making breakfast. 
I got up to join her. We were alone; on mornings after festivals, even farm 
families kept irregular hours.
“Good morning,” she said. “I’m Rafina; I don’t think we met last night.”
“I’m Eliana,” I said as Rafina served me a bowl of porridge. She looked 
familiar. When she looked into my face to give me my porridge, I realized 
who she was—the Old Way priestess I’d watched last night.
“You’ve come from the Bascio conservatory, haven’t you?” Rafina asked as 
she sat down to eat her own porridge. I nodded. “But you’re in robes, not 
new finery— why did you leave?”
“We were caught with boys,” I said.
Rafina looked up sharply, and I could tell that she didn’t believe me. I 
lowered my eyes and looked at my porridge.
“The Fedeli came to the Conservatory at Mascherata,” I said. “We’ve heard 
they went elsewhere in Verdia afterward. Did they come here?”
“Yes,” Rafina said. She said nothing more, but when she took my bowl, she 
stole a quick look at me with narrowed eyes, and I realized that she 
suspected me of being on their side. Her hostility was palpable, and for a 
moment, I was tempted to take out Bella’s cross and confess my own 
heresies to her. On the other hand, if the Fedeli returned, Rafina might 
well be arrested, and I didn’t want my name on the list they might tear out 
of her.
I wondered, if the Fedeli had been here, how the villagers had kept them 
from finding out about the Redentori. Perhaps the entire village was made 
up of apostates, who all stood together and protected each other. If that

was the case, they must have been able to justify pledging their loyalty to 
the Lady, or they’d all be dead.
It occurred to me that perhaps the practice had spread after the Fedeli 
came through.
In any case, Rafina seemed unlikely to discuss it with me. In the dawn 
sunlight through the windows, I stole another look at her, and she turned 
and looked me full in the face, as she’d looked at me last night. For a 
moment, even knowing how foolish it would be, I nearly told her 
everything. But then there was a rustle and a groan from the hearth as 
Giula started to get up. “Thank you for your kindness, signora,” I said.
“It’s nothing.” She rose, picking up a second bowl to fill with porridge for 
Giula. “The Lady has taught us hospitality. We know our duty.”
Giula moved slowly that day. I would have pushed her harder, if I hadn’t 
been so tired myself. My violin case felt like it was filled with sand, and I 
was tempted to eat all of my provisions right then to lighten my load. “We 
aren’t covering enough ground,” I muttered. It had only taken five days to 
walk from my home to Bascio when I came to the conservatory with my 
brothers; it was going to take me at least a week to get home now, maybe 
more. Hearing me, Giula quickened her pace for a few minutes, but we fell 
back to a slow trudge soon enough.
We were worn out by midafternoon, and started resting at every 
opportunity. “Where did you stay at night, when you came to the 
conservatory?” Giula asked.
“Houses. My brothers asked for hospitality.” Donato and Rufo had 
escorted me out; whenever we were well out of earshot of anyone, Rufo

had made elaborate mock-threats about what he’d do if anyone refused us 
a comfortable bed.
“Did you ever stay at an inn?”
“When we passed through Pluma. They didn’t trust city folk.”
Giula smiled. “My father paid for an inn, every night.” I must have looked 
shocked. “We’d had a really good harvest that year. Also, he kept talking 
about how once I got into an orchestra, I could support them, send some 
of my stipend home.” Her face grew sober. “I hope he isn’t angry.”
“Are you the only musician?”
“The only good one,” she said with a giggle, cheerful again. “But, you 
know, I have a cousin who’s headed for the Circle. She’s ...” Giula 
calculated for a moment. “... almost twenty. She just became a provisional 
member of the Circle; she’ll probably be a full member in another few 
years.”
I shivered; the air was growing chill.
“My mother was always jealous, of the money they got,” Giula said. “And 
my cousin didn’t have to go nearly as far away for her education.”
We don’t want your money; we want our daughter back. The furious 
words of Mira’s mother’s letter echoed in my head.
“I’m the best in my family at magery,” I said.
“Me too, except for that cousin,” Giula said. “Why do you think that is?”
“Concentration,” I said. “We know how to concentrate. That’s all it really 
takes.”
“Is that really it? And they make it sound so hard and impressive.” Giula 
sniffed.

“Any sisters or brothers at the seminary?”
“Well . . .” Giula dropped her voice. “Actually, you know, my oldest brother 
was once a priest.”
“Really?”
“Yes, and it really looked like he might have prospects. His first posting, 
well, it was a small town but it was close to Pluma. The word was, it was a 
posting that could lead to other things, if you know what I mean.”
“So what happened?” I asked.
“He and the priestess fell in love,” she said.
“So was this a problem?”
“It was a problem when the priestess got posted to the other side of 
Verdia.”
“Oh,” I said.
“And the new priestess was old, and ugly, and smelled like onions. He said. 
So he quit. And so did the priestess he was in love with. It was a bit of a 
scandal; it kind of embarrassed the people who’d done him favors, they 
were quite put out. So he moved away, and they settled down quietly. It’s 
been all right; they have four children now.” She smiled happily. “I 
thought it was terribly romantic, even if it was scandalous.”
I smiled too, thinking of Giula’s brother, wondering if he was as silly as she 
was. Probably not, if he’d been a priest with “prospects.”
Late in the day it started to rain, and we sought shelter in a roadside 
chapel. It was dimly lit and smelled of stale incense. We sat down near the 
door, trying not to drip water on the smiling icon of the Lady. Giula wrung 
out her skirt on the stone floor by the door. “What did you think of

Rafina?” she asked.
“She was nice enough,” I said.
“I got the feeling she didn’t like me,” she said. “Do you think maybe Marco 
was her daughter’s sweetheart or something? I’d hate to think I made 
trouble.”
I was pretty sure that wasn’t the problem, but I rolled my eyes anyway. 
“Maybe you should have thought of that before you slept with him.”
“Why do you assume I slept with him? Just because you saw me flirting—”
“I overheard you in the olive grove,” I said.
“Well, what were you doing there?” she demanded indignantly. “Spying on 
me?”
I rolled my eyes again and tried to wring some of the water out of my robe. 
“The rain’s slacking off. We should get moving again,” I said.
“Oh, come on,” Giula said. “Let’s just sleep here.”
“I was hoping for a host who could feed us dinner,” I said.
“But I’m tired of walking,” Giula said. “I know you don’t want me to slow 
you down, but we’re not getting much farther today anyway and I don’t 
want to go back out in the rain just to look for a house.”
“Why don’t you pray to the Lady,” a man’s voice said from near the altar, 
“and if She sees fit, She will arrange shelter for you.”
We turned around. Our eyes had adjusted to the gloom, and now we could 
see a man sitting in the front of the chapel. He glared at us with dark, 
sharp eyes, and I shivered.
“Of course,” I said, edging away from him without meaning to. What did 
he overhear? I thought, trying frantically to remember exactly what Giula

and I had said to each other. I raised my hands to the shadowed ceiling of 
the chapel and closed my eyes. “ Lord and Lady, if You see fit, please see to 
it that we have a roof over our heads and food to eat tonight.”
“You see?” the man said. His voice was like the low, steady drone of a bass 
string instrument, smooth and silky. “She only wants what’s best for all of 
us. And tonight She must want for you to have food and shelter, for I will 
be happy for you to stay with me.”
Liemo—he reminded me of Liemo, the mage who had come to collect 
Mira. I was too frightened of him to refuse, and Giula gladly accepted—she 
was willing to go back out in the rain if his house was as close as he 
promised. Back in the last of the daylight, I got a good look at him. He 
wasn’t tall for a man—shorter than me, with no gray in his hair. Not at all 
like Liemo, really, but there was something in his voice, something in the 
way he carried himself, that said that he was a man accustomed to power. 
This was not a village priest. No, I realized as I recognized the insignia on 
the sleeve of his tunic. Fedele. He was one of the Fedeli.
Giula looked stricken as we trailed behind the man on the muddy path. I 
clasped her hand, trying to send her the message, just smile and tell the 
same lies I do and everything will be fine. Only one night, I thought. Let 
him do the talking.
“My name is Aviro,” he said, glancing over his shoulder at us.
“I’m Eliana,” I said, and since Giula was still staring at him nervously, 
added, “and this is Giula.”
“You came from the conservatory,” he observed. I nodded. “I’ll have Frugia 
lend you some clothes.”
“Is Frugia a priestess?” Giula asked.

“No,” Aviro said. “Frugia is providing me with hospitality.”
He’d offered us hospitality in someone else’s house? That seemed rather 
rude to me, but just then I was more concerned about Giula’s look of open 
terror. If Aviro turned around, he’d know we had something to hide. I 
jabbed her in the ribs. “Smile,” I whispered.
Frugia met us at the door, a pale, nervous widow who looked older than 
she probably was. She ushered us up a ladder to the second-floor loft, to 
let us change into some dry clothes. “ You can borrow one of my daughter’s 
dresses until your clothing dries,” she said to Giula, and then looked me up 
and down. “You’re very tall,” she said. “I think we’ll have to get out some of 
my husband’s old clothing for you.”
“How long have the Fedeli been in your village?” I asked softly.
Frugia glanced toward the ladder. “Aviro is here to ensure the purity of our 
worship of the Lady,” she said, pitching her speech to be heard downstairs. 
“There are villages near here who have slipped into superstition or heresy. 
Aviro is here to find them and to show them their errors.” Her eyes showed 
fear and suppressed anger. “He has been here for two weeks,” she said in a 
softer voice. “I don’t know how much longer he’ll stay.”
From a shelf beside the bed, Frugia took out a dress and held it up. “This 
should do for Giula,” she said, and laid it across the bed. Then she opened 
a trunk by the window and took out a tunic and trousers, shaking them out 
and holding them up to me. “They won’t quite fit,” she said, “but they’ll do. 
Bring your own clothing downstairs when you’ve changed, and we’ll put it 
by the fire to dry.” She went back down the ladder to give us privacy to 
change.

It wasn’t until I pulled my robe over my head that I remembered Bella’s 
cross, on its ribbon around my neck. “Lady’s tits,” Giula hissed, her eyes 
going wide. “Are you mad?”
I hurriedly clasped my fist over it, as if Aviro might be watching from 
under the bed. “No harm done,” I whispered, giving her a reassuring grin, 
but she didn’t looked reassured. I slipped it over my head and hid it in my 
boot.
“I want to leave,” Giula whispered. “Now.”
“We can’t,” I whispered back. “We’ll look guilty.”
“So what? We won’t be here anymore.”
“Don’t you think he’ll come after us, if he thinks he should? We’ll eat 
dinner, sleep on the hearth, and leave at dawn. Just tell the same lies I do.” 
I considered for a moment. “And if you get a chance to use witchlight when 
he can see you, do it.”
Giula’s dress was made of a heavy linen fabric, dyed yellow. It fit her quite 
well, and I stepped back for a good look, impressed by the embroidered 
scooped collar and the narrow waist. My clothes were less decorative. I 
had a linen tunic over black wool trousers. It was loose in the wrong 
places, and Frugia had forgotten to get out a belt, but my red wool sash 
was only slightly damp, so. I belted it with that.
“You don’t look half bad in boys’ clothing,” Giula said. “Anything but the 
robes, I guess.” She smiled gamely. “Might as well make the best of it.” We 
combed our hair and climbed back down the ladder.
Frugia took our wet clothing and half-soaked cloaks and spread them by 
the fire. “Have a seat,” Aviro said, and gestured at the bench across the 
table from him.

We sat down.
“Why did you leave the conservatory?” he asked.
“We were expelled,” I said. “We were caught talking to boys. One too many 
times.”
Giula stared at the floor, feigning shame. “Did you have to tell him that?” 
she wailed.
“Giula, he’s with the Fedeli. Didn’t you see his insignia? We can’t lie to 
him.” I gave Aviro the look I’d seen Giula give male teachers, when she was 
trying to suck up. Giula was better at it, but Aviro preened anyway, and I 
felt mildly disgusted with myself.
“You were at the Verdiano Conservatory?” Aviro asked.
“Yes,” I said.
“There were members of my order there a few months ago,” Aviro said.
“Yes,” I said. “During Mascherata.”
“They executed a girl about your age for apostasy,” Aviro said. “I read the 
report.”
“Yes,” I said.
“Did you know her?”
I dug my fingernails into my knees to keep my face impassive. “Of course I 
knew her,” I said. “We were students together for four years.”
“Was she a friend of yours?”
“No,” I said. “Just someone I knew.”
“There was a servant, as well,” Aviro said.
“Giorgi,” I said. “He disappeared.”

“How much contact did you have with him?”
“Not much,” I said. “He worked in the kitchen.”
“How about you?” Aviro said to Giula.
“Not much,” she squeaked.
“And Bella? Were you friends with her?”
Giula shook her head.
Aviro turned his attention back to me. “Who is Rafina?” he asked. “The 
woman you spoke of in the chapel. Who is she?”
Giula was weakening—I could feel her trembling next to me on the bench. 
I dropped one hand under the table to squeeze her arm tightly. I needed to 
divert the conversation; Rafina was clearly guilty of apostasy, and sooner 
or later Giula would blurt something out. “Are we under suspicion of 
something?” I asked.
“Is there something on your conscience that would arouse my suspicions?” 
Aviro asked.
“No,” I said. “But you’re asking us questions like you think there is.”
“ ‘Innocence doesn’t need to hide,’ ” Aviro quoted.
I licked my lips. “ ‘When you welcome a guest,’ ” I quoted back, “ ‘you shall 
first bring wine, that he might refresh himself from his travels.’ Do you 
intend to meet the Lady’s obligations of hospitality?”
Aviro’s eyes narrowed and Giula sucked in her breath. “Are you quoting 
the Book of the Lady to me?”
“I shouldn’t have to,” I said.
Aviro slammed his fist down onto the table. “You—”

There was a crash from across the room. “Oh, Lady,” said a timid voice. 
We turned; it was Frugia’s eldest daughter, gathering up shards from a 
broken bowl. “It slipped out of my hands, signore. I’m so clumsy—I’m 
sorry.” She stared at us meekly in the silence. “Mother is almost done 
cooking dinner,” she said. “Why don’t we get ready?”
Aviro made the ritual offering to the Lady before the meal, then said a 
long, involved prayer, thanking the Lord and the Lady and their servants 
and everything short of the house sprites. Frugia and her children sat, 
backs straight, eyes closed. Even the youngest child, who couldn’t have 
been more than seven years old, sat perfectly still until the meal was 
served. By then, of course, it was lukewarm. Such is the price of piety.
Frugia’s eldest daughter sat to Aviro’s right, and I noticed as the meal 
progressed that she was keeping his wine cup filled to the brim. I glanced 
at Frugia and saw her giving her daughter an almost imperceptible nod.
When the meal was concluded, Aviro took out a worn, heavy copy of the 
Book of the Lady to read aloud. “ Lift up your voices to give eternal praise 
to the Lady and thanks unto Her,” he read. “For She will never turn Her 
back on you, nor turn a deaf ear to you in your time of need. She asks not 
blind faith, but places Her light in your hand, dispelling the darkness and 
the Maledori.” Aviro stumbled over Maledori, slurring the syllables. “Ever 
loving and ever faithful, She waits with open arms for all who seek Her 
warmth.” He stumbled again and yawned. “Excuse me. She watches us as 
we slumber. She—um.” He closed the book. “My apologies; I’m very tired. 
We’ll continue this in the morning.” He went up the ladder. Apparently 
Aviro slept upstairs; Frugia and her children slept in beds around the 
hearth.

Frugia’s oldest daughter cleaned up from dinner silently. Frugia went to 
look up the ladder, then returned and shook her head, and gestured for 
Giula and me to spread out our cloaks by the hearth.
“What were you thinking?” Giula hissed as we lay down.
I shrugged, not wanting to explain that I had been trying desperately to 
steer the conversation away from Rafina before Giula blurted anything 
out. I was too worried to be sleepy, and watched as Frugia put her younger 
children to bed. She peered up the ladder again, and nodded once to her 
eldest daughter. The daughter opened the door and peered out, then felt 
our robes, which had been moved out of the way of the bedrolls. She 
shrugged.
Frugia came down to sit beside Giula and me; her daughter followed.
“If you have anything to hide,” Frugia whispered, “then you should go 
now.”
“Won’t that make us look guilty?” Giula asked.
“Yes,” Frugia said. “But he already suspects you of something. You’re 
better off guilty and gone.”
“Will you get into trouble?” I asked.
Frugia’s daughter gave me a slight smile. “No,” she said. “He’ll sleep well 
into the morning, and we’ll tell him you left at dawn.”
“What about your clothes?” I asked.
Frugia looked us over. “Give me a coin and we’ll call it even.”
Giula took out a coin to give to Frugia, and we gathered up our cloaks, 
violins, and packs. We pulled our boots on.
I paused in the doorway to look back at Frugia. “Thank you,” I said.

“Don’t mention it,” Frugia said. “Some of us are faithful to the Lady’s 
obligations of hospitality. Now get going.”
It had stopped raining, and the moon was out. “Not a bad night for travel,” 
Giula breathed, and we headed down the road by moonlight.

I can cure the sick and cleanse the leper; I can
give sight to the blind and strength to the crippled. But
I cannot help those who will themselves to blindness,
and turn away. 
 
—The Journey of Gèsu, chapter 11, verse 30. 
 
 
We walked through the night and through the next day, and made it 
almost to Pluma. We were so tired we couldn’t even walk in a straight line; 
as evening fell, we found a spot off the road to camp. I wanted to try asking 
for hospitality—what were the odds of running into the Fedeli twice—but 
Giula refused, and we were close enough to the city that people were less 
likely to be hospitable. We could see the flicker of firelight through the 
trees. We hadn’t seen many refugees yet; the north-south road and the 
east-west road crossed just east of Pluma, a few hours’ walk from where we 
were.

Giula scraped out a hole in the ground for our fire while I gathered up 
firewood. We were fortunate that I was skilled at magery, or we’d never 
have gotten the damp wood lit. We spread out our cloaks and lay down; 
except for the tree root poking into my back, the ground was softer than 
the hearthstones had been.
“You were studying minstrel techniques, weren’t you?” Giula asked. “With 
Mira, before she ... left?”
“Yes,” I said.
“How well was it working?”
“Better than you’d expect,” I said. “Mira claimed she liked my singing 
voice.”
Giula laughed. “Could you teach me the techniques? How hard were they?”
“Not hard. Here, let’s tune up. I’ll show you a few tricks.” I sat up and took 
out my violin.
As Giula and I tuned our violins, I heard a footstep behind me and felt as if 
someone were staring at my back. I turned around slowly, afraid for a 
moment that it would be the Fedele.
It was not Aviro. Standing just outside our camp, staring at us, was an old 
man wrapped in a ragged cloak.
“So you’re here already,” he said hoarsely, still staring at me.
“Excuse me?” I said. “I don’t believe I know you.” Maybe he was someone 
from my village I’d forgotten? I felt a brief pang of worry. “But you can 
share our fire, if you like.”
He laughed, the gravelly chuckle rattling in his chest like pebbles, then 
hopped over a fallen branch to join us by our campfire. “Let me be the first

to salute you, Generale!” he said to me, and thumped his bony chest, then 
held his fist out, a soldier’s salute to his commander.
Giula and I exchanged shrugs. This diverted his attention to Giula.
“Ah, yes,” he leered. “And you as well.” He sidled up to Giula, and without 
warning, grabbed her breast. “Sweet young thing, aren’t you?”
Giula shrieked and smacked his hand; I shoved him away from her and 
stood between them. He pouted at us. “No fun; you’re no fun at all. You’re 
all like that. No fun at all. You’ll see—you’ll see what I mean.”
“Go away,” I said. “We don’t want to share our fire with a crazy man.”
“Go away,” he said sadly. “I’ll go away. No one wants to share their fire 
with me. I’ll sleep under a rock—don’t mind me.” He shuffled off into the 
night.
Giula brushed her dress clean, shaking and looking disgusted. “I can’t 
believe it. What a disgusting old man. Do you think we need to take turns 
watching?”
I closed my eyes. “Probably. You go ahead to sleep; I’ll take the first watch.”
I woke Giula midway through the night to take over watching—but when I 
woke at dawn, Giula was slumped over asleep under the tree she’d been 
leaning against, Fortunately, no one had robbed us, and the madman 
hadn’t come back. I sighed and shook Giula awake.
The road became much more crowded as we neared Pluma. I wondered 
how many of the people around us were refugees from the famine areas. 
The merchant caravans with their heavily armed escorts obviously weren’t. 
But looking around at the other people on the road, I wasn’t sure where 
“traveler” stopped and “refugee” started. Some of the travelers looked like

us, footsore and dirty but with packs clutched tightly against potential 
thieves. There were families that huddled together, resting by the edge of 
the road with small crying children. There were people who wore rags and 
carried nothing. I thought that Giula and I were obviously travelers, rather 
than refugees, but I saw one woman close one hand protectively over her 
necklace when she saw me approaching.
I smelled Pluma before I saw it. Smoke, road dust, incense, horse shit, 
perfume, fried meat, and the sour smell of rotting garbage mingled in the 
air. The city was surrounded by a high wall; we could see the ragged edge 
that had been filled in with newer stones after the war. The old wall that 
had remained standing after the war was dirty and worn; the new parts 
were cleaner, the rocks still rough.
Everyone around us seemed to be trying to get into the city; the press of 
people around me nearly pulled me away from Giula. I clasped her hand 
and tucked my violin under my arm to keep anyone from stealing it off my 
back, and we headed for the city gates.
“Name?” a city guard asked me.
“Eliana.”
“Business in Pluma?” he asked.
“Just passing through,” I said.
“Uh-huh,” he said. “Got coin?” I nodded. “Let’s see it.” I dug my coin purse 
out from its hiding place inside my tunic and held it open for his 
inspection. He gave it a cursory glance and waved Giula and me inside the 
gates.
Pluma was the largest city in Verdia. It was sort of our province’s 
extension of Cuore; there were government offices, an army detachment,

seminaries, a training school for children with magical talent, even a 
conservatory. The Pluma conservatory would have been closer to my home 
than the rural conservatory in Bascio, but my parents didn’t want me 
attending a conservatory in a city. The Pluma conservatory had many 
more students who paid fees, instead of being sponsored by the Circle; 
merchants sent their children there for the prestige of having a musician in 
the family.
“Do you remember where you stayed when you came through Pluma 
before?” Giula asked. I shook my head. “Me either.”
“I had two of my brothers with me then,” I said. Giula and I pulled out of 
the crowd and backed into an alley, leaning against a wall. I had never 
tried to make my way through such a crowd; when I had been here before, 
the city had been less crowded, and Donato and Rufo had pushed through 
the crowd on my behalf. “They chose the inn,” I said. “I don’t even 
remember the name, let alone where to find it.”
“At least it’s early in the day. We’ve plenty of time to find something.”
I shook my head. “We could move on, too.” We paused for a moment. 
Pluma was where Giula and I would part ways. Her parents lived south 
from here; mine, to the east. “But there’s no harm in resting a little,” I said 
finally.
“And seeing the city,” Giula said, her eyes lighting up. I shook my head. 
“We could buy you a dress,” she suggested.
“I rather like the tunic,” I said. “Maybe I should have been born a boy.”
She laughed. “You’re certainly tall enough.”
I wasn’t ready to move out of the alley yet, but then I heard a whisper from

just behind my feet. “Signora. Pssst, signora.” I jumped and jerked away. 
Two eyes stared at me from a tiny gap in the crumbling brick wall, looking 
terrifyingly malevolent in the shadows.
“Let’s go,” I said, grabbing Giula’s arm. “Do you know what you need to 
buy?”
“I still think we should buy you a dress,” Giula said. “But if you really don’t 
want one—provisions, I suppose. We don’t have much food left.”
I didn’t know where the market was, so we followed people who looked 
like they were heading to haggle. Pluma was a maze of narrow streets, and 
there were far too many people here; the town had never been meant to 
hold so many. “They’ve certainly rebuilt since the war, haven’t they?” Giula 
said, staring around us at the tall buildings.
Pluma was the farthest north the Vesuviano army had come. They had 
attacked the city, then been pushed back south by the Circle. Last I’d 
heard, there were still soldiers stationed there. During the battle, 
apparently, half the east wall had been blown away and a number of 
Pluma’s inhabitants killed. Rumor said that nothing in Pluma would grow, 
either, but the city-dwellers were better off than the farmers, since they 
could at least buy food.
“We aren’t even in the parts of the town that were damaged,” I said to 
Giula.
“Oh, I suppose not. Do you suppose they’ve rebuilt those parts?”
“Signore?” I felt a hand grasp the edge of my tunic and looked down to see 
a scrawny, shrill-voiced child. “Signore— signora,” he corrected himself, “—
please, signora.” He held out his hands, cupped upward. “I’m hungry.” He 
wore the remains of a shirt, stained and badly torn.

Giula paled and looked away, horrified. I wondered if she was thinking 
about her family, in the famine areas, or if she was trying hard not to. I 
dug in my pouch for a piece of cheese. “Here,” I said, putting it in the 
child’s outstretched hands. He stared for an instant, amazed, then stuffed 
the whole piece into his mouth and ran off like a frightened rat.
The market square was watched by guardsmen who looked us over before 
standing aside to let us in. This square was in part of the town that had 
been damaged during the war, and only parts of it had been rebuilt. The 
houses ringing the open area had new stone in part of the walls, but the 
ruins of a fountain stood in the center of the square. The rising curve of 
what was left of the fountain edge was now used by merchants to show 
their wares.
We made our way toward the cheese merchant. Standing in the line by his 
stall, I saw the flash of silver from the corner of my eye and turned my 
head to see that I stood shoulder-to-shoulder with a Fedele priest. I 
instinctively ducked my head, but it wasn’t Aviro, and he ignored me as he 
haggled for his cheese. I listened attentively while I waited; either the 
cheese merchant was badly cheating the Fedele, or prices in Pluma were 
shockingly high.
“May I help you, signore?” the cheese merchant said. It took me a moment 
to realize that he was addressing me. I decided not to bother telling him I 
wasn’t a boy. I ended up paying the same price for my cheese that the 
Fedele priest had paid for his; when I tried for a lower price, the merchant 
just laughed.
I turned to the next woman in line. “Is cheese particularly expensive 
here?” I asked her.

She snorted. “The cheese is cheap, girl,” she said. “You won’t see a better 
price than he’s giving you.”
I sighed and dug out my coin pouch, weighing the cheese with my hand 
after the merchant gave it to me. Giula and I each bought several pounds, 
then stocked up on hardbread and wine. There seemed to be no shortage 
of food here, but the woman at the cheese stand had told the truth—all the 
prices were high. Everyone around me looked hungry; I was no longer 
certain I wanted to spend the night here.
“The wine merchant told me where we could find a good inn,” Giula said. 
“He said sleeping on the road near here wasn’t a good idea—we could be 
robbed.” She led me through a long maze of streets and alleys with 
complacent certainty until we came to a dead-end against the edge of the 
city wall. “Huh,” she said. “This should have had a left turn onto the street 
that was going to lead to the inn.”
“Maybe it did before they rebuilt,” I said. The wall here was lower, and half 
crumbled, leaving footholds. On impulse I climbed up to peer over. “Lady’s 
tits,” I whispered, looking out over a field of tents, as far as the eye could 
see. “Giula, climb up here, you need to see this.”
Grumbling, she did her best, catching her foot on her skirt at one point 
and nearly falling. Finally she pulled herself up to lean over the crumbling 
edge, and her eyes grew wide as she looked. “Who are they?”
“Refugees. They must be. Who else would live like that?”
“Why do they stay here?”
A breeze gusted across our faces, and I smelled rotting meat and cooking 
fires. “There’s food here,” I said. “At least a little.” Staring out, I realized

that there were tents in the areas closer to the wall, but that past those, 
there were people in the open, wrapped in blankets or just sitting. I had 
never seen so many people gathered in one place in my life, nor had I ever 
seen such poverty. In my village, no one was rich, but no one starved. Even 
when the town drunk died suddenly, his wife and children were taken care 
of—sometimes grudgingly, but always taken care of—until the children 
were old enough to run the farm. They were pitied, occasionally scorned, 
often resented, but they were never left to starve, never shut out of shelter, 
never—
“Get off of there!”
Giula and I jumped down off the wall and turned to face two soldiers. 
“Sorry,” Giula gasped, cringing.
“What were you doing up there?”
“We’re lost,” Giula said. “It’s my fault. I thought I could find us an inn. The 
wine merchant gave us directions. I’ve never been in the city before 
without my brothers ...” I let her babble on; she was doing a better job of it 
than I would.
“Do you have coin?” one of them asked. We nodded. “Let’s see it.”
I took out my pouch slowly, wondering if they were going to steal it, or 
demand a bribe. I stood up as straight as I could, glaring at them as they 
stared at me coolly. Digging my hand into my purse, I closed my fist over 
every coin I had, holding my purse half closed so that the soldiers couldn’t 
tell it was now empty. They stared at the scant coins in my palm 
skeptically, then shrugged and gestured for me to put it away again.
“Go back to the last street and turn left,” the taller soldier said. “Stay on

Agostino’s. It’s comfortable and cheap, or as cheap as you’ll find in Pluma 
without going into areas we don’t recommend for ladies.”
They escorted us back to the previous corner. “What are you doing in 
Pluma?” the shorter soldier asked Giula.
“We’re going home,” she said. “We’ve been at a conservatory. Her village is 
east of here, and mine is south.”
The soldiers glanced at each other, then back at us. “Signora, we don’t 
recommend heading south from here,” the tall one said. “Not at all, not for 
anyone.”
“Why?” Giula said.
“It’s hungry and dangerous down there.”
“East is all right, though?” I asked.
The shorter soldier looked at me with something like pity. “East is better,” 
he said finally.
“We can’t stay here,” I said.
“No,” he said. “Once you ran out of coin, we’d have to escort you from the 
city.”
“Thank you for your time,” I said. “And for directing us to an inn. Good 
day.”
Next to me, Giula was near tears; I was angry at them, for upsetting her, 
and for telling us that what we were doing was stupid without being able to 
offer a better alternative.
“Let’s go,” I said, and urged her down the street.
“Hungry and dangerous,” she said. “How dare they talk like that about my 
home!”

“That’s right,” I whispered soothingly.
“There are good people in my village. The war never came there.”
“Here’s the inn,” I said. “Agostino’s.”
Agostino was surly, but he had plenty of rooms, and the inn did seem to be 
clean. If the price he charged us was cheap, I didn’t want to know what a 
pricey inn would cost. We were left with one coin each. “Dinner’s in an 
hour,” he said. “You can sit in the common room until then if you like.”
The common room was crowded and noisy; we were almost the only 
women there. We found an empty corner and slipped our violins under the 
table. I could see a few people sneaking glances at us, but fortunately Giula 
was too distraught to flirt.
“Your family is fine, Giula,” I said, squeezing her hand. “You’d have heard 
if they weren’t, wouldn’t you?” She nodded. “Didn’t they tell you the 
harvest was all right? Didn’t they say there was enough food?” She nodded 
again, still not answering. “How many brothers and sisters do you have, 
Giula? I forget.”
“Twelve living,” she whispered, finally answering. “Four brothers and eight 
sisters.”
“Your mother must be one tired lady.”
Giula sniffled and then laughed a little. “My mother can’t make witchlight. 
She’s almost a little simple—she never would have gotten married if she 
hadn’t been so pretty when she was young. But she can’t make a witch-
light, and has to use a flint and steel to start a fire.”
“So she couldn’t keep from having babies that way,” I said, nodding.
“She used to call my father in from the fields to start fires for her. ‘Elmo,

could you start this for me?’ ‘Lina, didn’t I just start a fire for you?’ ‘Yes, 
but you know me, I’m so clumsy, I spilled the dishwater on the hearth, and 
put it out.’ Over and over again, to try to make it so that my father 
wouldn’t be fathering any babies.” She chuckled, then sighed. “He did 
finally catch on, and he went along with it. She still had three more babies, 
though.”
“Which one were you?”
“The first of those last three.” She smiled. “So I suppose I can’t complain 
too much about all those children.”
“You must have a lot of nieces and nephews.”
“Hordes,” she said. “I’ve lost count. There were twenty-five when I left 
home. I forget how many since then.”
“Are any of them any good with a violin?”
“There’s a nephew who’s supposed to be good at drums. He’s almost 
twelve now.”
Someone was glaring at me from across the room. I turned to look, half 
expecting to see the crazy old man, but it was a boy, not a lot older than I 
was, with a shock of dark hair and violet-blue eyes. I gave him a long, 
direct stare, and he went back to staring at his drink. “Check out 
handsome,” I muttered to Giula.
“Oh!” she said. “I don’t think I like him. He doesn’t look very nice.”
He glanced up to give us another malevolent glare, and I rolled my eyes. 
“Maybe we’re sitting in his spot.”
Giula giggled. “Maybe he’s actually from your village, and you’ve forgotten 
him. You slighted him when you were nine and he’s hated you ever since.”

Now I started giggling. Lots of people were staring at us now, along with 
the boy, but I was so glad to have something to laugh at that I didn’t care. 
“You never know,” I said.
Dinner was skimpy soup with bread and half-sour wine, but no one else 
seemed to view this as unusual fare, so we dug in and made the best of it. 
The soup was tasty, despite being thin, and the bread was fresh, so I 
concluded that we’d done fairly well by our money. It just wasn’t what we 
were used to. “I’m still hungry,” Giula said when we went up to our room, 
so we broke out our provisions and had a little hardbread with cheese.
There was a single wide bed. I hoped Giula wouldn’t steal the blankets. 
Since I’d had no sisters, I’d only rarely shared a bed even before going to 
the conservatory. The door had a heavy bar, which we swung into place 
before lying down.
The room had a barred and shuttered window. Giula was asleep within 
minutes, but I lay for a while with my eyes open, listening. In the street 
below I could hear voices, feet splashing through puddles, occasionally the 
steady tromp of a horse. Downstairs, there were voices in the common 
room, and I heard the occasional thump of an emphatic cup being banged 
to the table. I could hear snatches of music, probably coming from next 
door or down the street. Maybe someday I could find a job playing for a 
tavern, as a minstrel. Maybe. I closed my eyes, and fell asleep.
I woke with a start; the night was chill and very quiet. I had been dreaming 
about the boy from the common room; I’d been furious at him, and he’d 
been shouting that he was the one in charge, not me. I shivered, and then 
realized that the bed was cold because it was empty. Giula was gone.
She’s probably just gone to use the outhouse, I thought, and tried to go

back to sleep. I closed my eyes, but my nervousness increased. How could 
she get into trouble going to the outhouse? This is ridiculous. I swung my 
legs out of bed and sat up with a groan. Giula was going to laugh at me. 
Still. . .
Her boots were gone, but everything else was still here, implying that I’d 
guessed her intentions correctly. I left my boots off, closed the door behind 
me as quietly as I could, and tiptoed down the stairs.
I could see firelight under the common room door, and I could hear voices. 
I pressed my ear against the door.
“She’s a spy, Cilo.”
“Don’t be so hasty.”
“Don’t be a fool. Look at her!” Boots stomped across the floor, and I heard 
a smack and a shriek. “We know you’re from the Fedeli. Tell us what you 
heard!” the voice shouted.
That was enough. I slammed the door open. “Leave her alone!” I shouted.
Five men turned. Giula collapsed against the wall, crying. “Eliana! Oh 
thank the Lady. Eliana, they’ve been shouting at me, and they won’t 
believe me, and they say I’m a spy and you are too, and, and, and—”
The boy who’d glared at me during dinner stood over Giula, his hand 
raised to hit her again. I strode straight to him. Even barefoot, I was 
slightly taller than he was; I drew myself up to my full height to stare him 
down. “You. I don’t know what your problem is, but you clearly decided we 
were spies the moment you laid eyes on us. I don’t know who the hell you 
are or what you think you’re doing that would be worth spying on, but if 
you can spot a spy from across a crowded room, the Fedeli could certainly 
use your talents.” I turned away from him and knelt next to Giula, trying

to reassure her.
“You see, Cilo?” The violet-eyed boy turned furiously to the older man. “I 
was right.”
I lifted Giula up, one hand around her waist. “If I were one of the Fedeli,” I 
snapped, “I’d have you drawn and quartered by my men-at-arms for 
hitting my friend. Bastardo.”
One of the men, not Cilo, blocked the door.
“We’re not spies,” I said. Across the room, I could see a loaf of bread and a 
carafe of wine on the table, and on impulse, I flipped Bella’s cross out from 
under my dress. The man who had blocked our way stared at it for a 
moment, then slowly moved aside. “Can we go now, please?” I asked.
“That proves nothing,” the young man shouted.
Cilo turned on him and said mildly, “It explains why the girl was listening 
to us, does it not, Giovanni?” He turned back to us and bowed slightly. “Go 
in peace. We apologize.”
Giula’s cheek was flaming red where the boy had slapped her. She 
continued crying as I helped her up the stairs and back to our room. “What 
happened?” I asked as I barred our door.
“I went to the outhouse,” she whimpered. “On my way there, I heard music
—singing. Old Way music. So I stopped to listen. Then they opened the 
door and dragged me in. The boy who was glaring at us, he wouldn’t stop 
yelling. I told him I wasn’t a spy but he didn’t believe me—” her voice went 
quivery and she sniffled, wiping her nose on her sleeve. “I’m so glad you 
came.”
I helped her sit down on the edge of the bed, but she didn’t take off her

boots. “I still have to go to the outhouse,” she said, looking up at me 
pathetically.
I escorted her back downstairs. The common room was empty and silent 
as we passed. We slipped out the back door; I was still barefoot, so I waited 
in the doorway while she ducked into the outhouse. As I waited, I heard 
someone behind me. It was the boy with violet eyes—Giovanni.
“May we have your permission to relieve ourselves, signore?” I whispered.
“ You were never going to the outhouse,” he said.
“You’re right,” I said. “I came looking for my friend. Now would you be so 
kind as to go away, so that she doesn’t start crying again when she comes 
out of the privy and sees you?”
“I’m sorry your friend is such a fragile little flower—” he said.
“You hit her,” I said, furious. “You decided we were spies because we were 
strangers. It never crossed your mind that we might just be strangers, 
trying to get home to our families. Spies for the Fedeli! Unbelievable. Now 
go away,” I said again, because the outhouse door was starting to open.
With a final muttered insult, Giovanni slipped away, and was out of sight 
when Giula padded up the stone walk. “Come on,” I said to her. “Let’s get 
back to bed.”
The next morning, I walked Giula to the south gate. “Do you think you can 
make this last bit on your own?” I asked. She nodded. Giula’s family lived 
only a day or two south of Pluma, and another five miles east of the main 
road—the war really had gone right past them. Giula was still shaken from 
the confrontation in the night, but once she was out of the city, I was fairly 
certain she’d be all right. I gave her a long hug.

Giula sniffled. “I don’t know when I’ll see you again,” she said.
“Soon,” I said. “We’re friends. We’ll find each other.”
Giula hesitated for a long moment, and I smiled at her encouragingly. 
“Bye,” she said finally, and walked away down the road. I watched her go 
for a few minutes. She did not turn to look back. After a while, I turned 
east.
I knew it should be faster to go through the city, but I’d have to find my 
way through the streets. I decided to just walk the extra distance around 
the edge.
As had happened when I approached the city, I smelled the refugee camp 
before I saw it. Gusts of wind brought the smell of death as I circled the 
last of the wall. I hesitated, but the road east led directly through the 
encampment. There was no way to go but through.
Giula had turned away from the boy begging for food yesterday, but there 
was nowhere to look here that was “away.” Filthy children with huge 
hungry eyes swarmed around me as I walked through the camp; I could 
feed one or two, but how could I feed all of them? There were hundreds—
no, thousands of people here.
As I’d noticed the previous evening, the tents were toward the city wall. As 
I moved outward, it grew worse. There were people dying, fevered and 
alone. There were people too weakened by hunger to move, who stared at 
me as I passed, arms wrapped around bony legs.
There was nothing I could do. Nothing I could do. After what seemed like a 
thousand years of walking, I passed the last sprawling bodies, and walked 
out into open fields.

The road was quiet without Giula, but I made better time. By the end of 
the day, I’d covered half again as much road as I would have with Giula. I 
tried not to think about how much my feet hurt; once I was home, I’d be 
able to rest.
Heading south and west, I passed through territory that had seen battle. 
This wasn’t truly famine area; crops were stunted and shrunken, but they 
were at least growing. Some of the farms I saw were clearly abandoned—
many had been destroyed during the war, and had caved-in roofs and 
burned-out barns.
Even in the worst areas, the land was returning to life. It was only early 
spring, but weeds and grasses grew knee-high in the abandoned fields, and 
honeysuckle worked its way through the fallen stones of the empty houses. 
There were no trees here, though, just a few stunted shrubs. I passed what 
had once been an olive grove; every tree was twisted and black, burnt 
skeletons frozen in place, arms raised in surrender.
I spent the first two nights in abandoned farmhouses, but came to an 
inhabited farm on the third evening and knocked on the door. The woman 
who answered was young, not much older than myself, and carried an 
infant. “Good evening, signora,” I said. “I’m traveling to my family’s home 
in Doratura and I need a place to stay. Can you provide me with 
hospitality?”
“Come in,” she said, stepping out of the doorway. “You’re welcome to stay 
with us. My name is Herennia.”
The cottage was small, but clean. I put my packs by the door and sat down 
at the table. Herennia balanced the baby on her hip as she added a bit

more water to the soup and then poured me a cup of wine.
“My husband, Metello, will be back soon,” she said, sitting down across 
from me. “Where are you coming from?”
I told her I’d been at a conservatory and described my travels. Herennia 
listened with interest, rocking the baby. “We came here last summer,” she 
said. “The farm was abandoned, and no one seemed to expect that the 
family that had lived here would come back. The neighbors didn’t mind if 
we settled here, so we did.”
“Are things very bad where you came from?” I asked.
“Terrible.” Herennia didn’t elaborate. “We were very surprised that anyone 
would leave this farm. We got some planting in, late last summer. I hadn’t 
had the baby yet then. We grew just enough to last us through the winter. 
They say the plants here are stunted, smaller than they should be, but ...” 
She shrugged. The baby took a handful of her sleeve and stuffed it into its 
mouth. She pulled the sleeve away gently and leaned across the table 
toward me. “We’ve heard recently that people in the famine areas aren’t 
being allowed to leave.” Her voice was tinged with horror. “We heard 
soldiers were sent to keep them from leaving.”
The baby grabbed again, at something around Herennia’s neck, and I 
realized that he’d grabbed a tiny wooden cross on a ribbon. Herennia 
followed my shocked gaze and her smile tightened. She started to turn 
away, to tuck it back under her dress.
“Wait,” I said, catching her arm. “I’m just surprised. With the Fedeli in 
Verdia—aren’t you afraid?”
Herennia didn’t reply; her fist closed over the cross. I stared at her rigid 
face, floundering for something I could say that would make her trust me.

“At the conservatory,” I said, “we always played Old Way music—secretly. 
Then the Fedeli came last winter. One of my closest friends had become 
Redentore; they killed her when she refused to renounce her faith.”
Herennia’s face softened, but she still said nothing.
I pulled out Bella’s cross. “This was Bella’s. I’ve worn it since she died.”
Herennia raised her eyebrows. “That was foolish of you,” she said. “The 
Fedeli could have seen it.”
“But you wear one,” I said. “Haven’t the Fedeli come here?”
Herennia bent her head briefly to her baby, then looked up at me again, 
and I could see that she’d decided to trust me. “The Fedeli don’t come this 
far south.”
“How can you be sure? Maybe they just haven’t come yet.”
“They won’t,” Herennia said. “There are too many of us here. They’re 
frightened of us, and they’re frightened of the famine. They won’t go past 
Pluma.” She touched Bella’s cross gently. “You can wear that openly here,” 
she said. “Don’t be afraid.”
I nodded and touched the cross uncertainly. It felt very strange not to have 
it tucked under my robe.
“Do you know what this means?” she asked, seriously.
I shook my head. “Another one of my friends—” I couldn’t say Mira’s 
name. “She got several of us to play the songs together. Bella actually 
became Redentore, but the rest of us just played the music. It’s beautiful.”
Herennia’s smile warmed. “It is, isn’t it? Do you know any of the dances?”
“Dances?” I said, then remembered the group I’d spied on in Bosco. “No.”
“Do you know the creed?”

I shook my head.
“Have you been sealed?”
I shook my head again.
The door swung open, and without meaning to I clapped my hand to my 
chest to hide the cross. It was Metello, Herennia’s husband. “Metello, this 
is Eliana,” Herennia said. “She is one of us.”
“Evening, signora,” Metello said with a slight bow. “Glad to have you here.”
They said a prayer before dinner; I bowed my head when they did and 
crossed myself as they finished. Herennia passed the baby to Metello for a 
while, so that she could eat, then took him back so that Metello could eat 
some more. The soup was thin; I would be hungry later.
“Why did you leave your conservatory?” Herennia asked. “Shouldn’t you 
be going to join an orchestra?”
I shook my head, bending my head over my soup to stall for a moment. I 
didn’t want to tell her the lie I’d been using, that I’d been caught with a 
boy. For one thing, I liked Herennia and her husband, and for another, I 
wasn’t sure she’d believe me. But I really didn’t want to tell the whole story 
about Mira, and what she turned out to be. “I found out that magefire 
caused the famine,” I said, and looked up from my soup, to see how they 
reacted.
The baby was squirming; Herennia offered him her breast, stroking his 
soft dark hair as he nursed. Metello had looked up sharply at my words. 
“So the Lady’s Gift is poison,” he said.
“Yes.” I looked back down at my soup. “I’d always hoped to play with an 
orchestra in Cuore, but after I found out about magefire—I didn’t want to

have anything to do with the Circle. So I left.”
“Let’s hear you play,” Metello said, so I finished my soup and tuned up my 
violin. I played one of the ballads I’d learned with Mira, to warm up, and 
then played the music for the Redentore healing prayer. The fire had 
burned down, leaving the room deeply shadowed; I couldn’t see 
Herennia’s reaction to my playing, or Metello’s.
When I finished, they were silent for a moment, Herennia rocking the 
baby. Then Herennia said, “God is with you, Eliana, even if you don’t know 
it.” Her voice was distinct in the darkness, and I wasn’t sure if she meant 
to reassure me or to frighten me.
Metello was gone when I got up in the morning; Herennia gave me a small 
bowl of porridge for breakfast, then said, “Wait a while. There’s something 
that must be done before you go on.”
We sat on the doorstep of the house, in the sunshine, Herennia’s baby in 
her lap. Her cat sauntered over and rubbed against my leg; I picked it up 
and it purred vigorously, butting its head against my chin. The morning 
sun dazzled my eyes. Staring across Herennia and Metello’s fields, I could 
almost see my own mother striding along the path, a basket over her arm 
and a jug of water balanced on one hip. Normally she would bring out a 
snack of bread and cheese in midmorning to whoever was working in the 
fields, but one day when we were planting, the basket contained bread and 
cheese and a kitten. One of the cats had had kittens a few weeks earlier, 
and my mother had finally found them, and she’d brought one out to the 
fields for us to play with. Donato had set the kitten on his shoulder; it had 
squeaked a protest and tightened its claws, but Donato had just laughed, 
gently detached it, and handed it to me.

Metello returned with an old woman, one of the grannies who had 
probably never given up the Old Way. She kissed Herennia’s baby and 
then squinted into my face. “What’s your name, boy?” she asked.
“I’m not a boy,” I said. “My name is Eliana.”
She looked startled, squinted into my face again, then let out a rusty 
chuckle. “Very well then, Eliana. Have you received God’s seal?” she asked.
“I don’t know what you mean,” I said.
She motioned for me to kneel and took a cup of water from the well. “This 
will give you God’s seal upon your soul,” she said, as if this explained 
everything. She muttered briefly in the Old Tongue, finishing off with the 
familiar Arka, v’bara, v’nehora kadosha. With the water, she drew a cross 
on my forehead, each eyelid, my lips, my hands, my stomach, and my feet. 
“May your soul be filled with the glory of God. May your eyes be opened to 
see the world of God,” she murmured, “May your lips be opened to speak 
the word of God. May your hands be strengthened to do the work of God. 
May your womb be opened to have children for God. And may your feet 
carry you along the path God has laid out for you.” She poured a little 
water into her cupped hand, then splashed it over my head. It dripped 
down the back of my neck as she kissed me on the forehead with a loud 
smack. “Welcome, daughter,” she said, and then sniffled, her eyes filling.
Herennia and Metello were smiling happily as they helped me to my feet. 
“There,” Herennia said. “Now God will definitely be looking after you, 
wherever you go.”
I was baffled, but I was afraid that if I asked for an explanation, it would be 
lengthy, so I thanked all of them and took my leave.
My eyes, opened by God or not, didn’t see anything different as I

continued south and west. I cringed a little, thinking back over the ritual. 
“May your womb be opened”? Maybe if I’d stayed home and gotten 
married I would want children. All my sisters-in-law seemed happy 
enough to have baby after baby, even if they discreetly tried to space the 
pregnancies a bit. I was certainly old enough for a husband and children, 
but when I tried to imagine a husband, I blushed and found myself 
wanting to think of something else.
In late afternoon, I stopped to rest under a tree for a little while. My feet 
were blistered, and I tried not to think about how much worse I was 
making them by pushing myself. I took off my boots for a few minutes, just 
to give my feet a little air, and shrugged off my pack and violin case.
I needed something to occupy my mind for a time, to keep me from 
fretting about my lack of progress while I waited. As I set down the pack, I 
heard a bump that reminded me that I still had the box of Mira’s letters. I 
opened my bundle; the box was near the bottom.
I suspected that the letters at the top were the most recent, so I tipped 
them out into my hand and read from the bottom up. Dear Miriamne, 
read the first letter. We miss you so much. It read much like a letter from 
my own mother. Mira had been taken away from her parents; this was 
unusual for a child with mage ability. Normally, promising children stayed 
with their parents until they were twelve. They attended academies close 
to home, where their parents could visit, for four years after that. Mage-
talented children might be taken from their homes, though, if their parents 
were troublemakers—which Mira’s parents were, that was clear from the 
letters. You stupid fools. I remembered this letter. We don’t want your 
money. We want our daughter back. Isabella and Marino of Tafano,

Verdia.
I should have realized when I read this—parents of mage-talented children 
were paid a stipend when their children left home. Parents of seminarians 
received a stipend as well—my parents had been supportive of my 
brother’s decision when he left the seminary, but mildly depressed at the 
loss of income. Parents of conservatory students received nothing, 
although most professional musicians sent some of their money home, so 
the investment was generally considered worth it.
Mira—Miriamne—was exceptionally talented. Liemo had called her a 
focus, and reading the letters, it became clear what he meant. Any mage 
could raise a great deal of power and unleash it; mages working in concert 
could raise enough power to rain fire down on an entire army. A focus, 
though, could direct that power with the precision of a seamstress’s 
needle. Burning, for instance, a crossbow bolt even as it sped toward its 
target. Miriamne was so skilled that as a test of her abilities when she 
demanded admittance to the full Circle, just before her sixteenth birthday, 
she had burned her name into the side of a flying bolt. And sent the bolt to 
her mother, apparently, as a gift, because Isabella thanked her for it and 
complimented her skill, though she sounded a bit like my mother the time 
two of my brothers had presented her with the biggest frog they’d ever 
found.
During the war, the tone of Isabella’s letters grew both fearful and 
reproachful. Miriamne served on the front lines during the war, and 
Isabella was clearly very worried about her. At the same time, she pointed 
out repeatedly how close Miriamne was to her home; surely, during a 
break in the fighting, she could visit? Then the fighting intensified, and

Isabella was simply worried. Please, my daughter, remember that as 
skilled as you are, there may be one just like you on the other side of the 
battlefield. Please try to stay out of that person’s sight.
The first letter after the war ended was openly angry and reproachful; 
Miriamne had not come. I would have thought that you would have liked 
to see your grandmother, at least, Isabella wrote. You and she were so 
close once, and she is an old woman now. And she is not getting any 
younger.
I wished I could see Mira’s letters; I wondered if I would recognize my 
friend in them. Some of the early letters sounded as if Mira’s mother was 
trying to take her down a peg. Don’t think this makes you better than your 
parents, Isabella had said in one letter. And in another, They’re telling you 
that you’re better, you’re theirs, and you’re alone. They’re lying on all 
three counts. Mira’s father had never written to her; I assumed that this 
was because he couldn’t read or write. Most of my brothers couldn’t.
The letter that started with “you stupid fools” had not been written to 
Mira; I wondered how she had come into possession of it. I could imagine 
someone like Liemo flinging it down before the child-Mira, taunting her 
with her mother’s impotent anger. I imagined the child-Mira picking it up 
when he was gone, keeping it secretly with her other letters. I could see her 
reading it over as tangible proof of her mother’s love, that Isabella would 
risk the wrath of the Circle by raging at them for taking away her daughter. 
That was the letter I had knocked off her desk at the conservatory. She 
must have taken it out sometimes to read it. Maybe she was trying to draw 
strength from her mother’s anger.
My own mother was not a firebrand like Isabella. Still, I remembered one

time that I had been unjustly blamed for something by a neighbor—she 
had cursed at me for picking her roses, when it was actually the squirrels 
eating them. My mother had overheard, and had come to my rescue, her 
face flushed and her fists clenched. I had been relieved that my mother 
didn’t believe I was guilty, but also frightened by her anger. She seldom 
got really angry.
I had missed her terribly my first year at the conservatory. 
 
Dear Miriamne, 
 
We have terrible news for you. Your grandmother has died. This was the 
final, most recent letter. We are all doing poorly from the famine. Not 
even weeds grow in our fields these days, and any reserves we had before 
are gone. The money from the Circle helps, as much as I hate to admit it, 
but we have to share with the rest of the village. Even if they do not 
expect it, we feel an obligation.
Your grandmother grew ill from a fever. It was not a terrible sickness, 
and she was once a strong woman, but weakened by hunger, she died. 
She asked for you in her delirium. We told her you’d come if you could.
We don’t know how much longer we can stay here, but we don’t know 
where else we can go. There are rumors that we won’t be allowed to 
leave, that the Circle will do whatever it takes to keep us here. Do you 
know if that’s true? They would starve us to death willfully?
Do you know if they will let you come for a visit soon? You said that once 
the war was over, you’d be able to visit again. We’d love to see you, 
Miriamne. Please. You can’t truly have turned your back on us. Take care

of yourself and don’t let them frighten you. 
God bless you. Love, your mother. 
 
I folded the letter. This must have been the letter that arrived in Cuore, 
with Mira’s grandmother’s violin—this must have been the letter that 
convinced her to run away. I tried to imagine Mira in Cuore, weeping over 
the letter and saying to herself, No more. It occurred to me that she could 
not have left immediately; to make good her escape, she would have had to 
do some planning. Maybe she told the Circle that she intended to visit her 
family, headed to Verdia, and never returned. It occurred to me that the 
Circle had probably sent people to visit Isabella, looking for Mira. I found 
myself hoping that Isabella hadn’t gotten herself in trouble when the Circle 
came. Reading over the letters, I’d started to like her.
“Signora.”
I jumped up, still barefoot, and turned to stare at the person speaking; the 
letter fluttered from my hand. It took me a moment to realize that it was 
the madman who had accosted Giula and me outside of Pluma. “Go away,” 
I said. Had he followed me? How had he known where I was going?
Instead of leaving, he fell to his knees. “Pray for me,” he said in a husky 
voice.
“Pray for you? Why?”
“Anointed of God,” he said. “Pray for me!” I came over to stand beside him 
and he pulled me down to kneel, facing him. “In the name of the Mother 
and Her Son and the Light,” he said, and looked at me expectantly.
“I don’t know what you want from me,” I burst out.

“Not like that!” he said. “How will you ever reach your destination if you 
say such stupid prayers?”
“You’re crazy,” I said.
“Of course I am!” he said. “That’s why I want you to pray for me.”
I sighed in frustration, but he had a good grip on my sleeves, and showed 
no inclination to let me back up. Finally, I sketched a cross on his 
forehead. “B’shem Arka, v’barah, v’nehora kadosha,” I said. “Rachamin, 
Arka. Rachamin, Gèsu. Refuya, Arka. Refuya, Gèsu.” I had come to the end 
of what I knew, so I drew another cross on his forehead.
“Thank you,” he said. He now wore a beatific smile. “God opened my eyes. 
She opened my eyes. But what I see isn’t always what everyone else sees.” 
He stood up slowly, dragging me after him. I stood barefoot in the road, 
wondering if he were ever going to let go of me.
“Do you want to know what I see when I look at you?” he asked.
“No,” I said.
“I see the soldier,” he said. “I see the fires. I see—” He released me 
abruptly and I stumbled back a step. “You don’t need me, Eliana,” he said. 
“You can see clearly enough for yourself.” He turned and headed down the 
road, back the way I had come, humming to himself.
How had he known my name? I stared after him, terribly shaken, and 
eventually concluded that he must have listened to Giula and me talking, 
back when he first harassed us in the woods. I watched until he was out of 
sight—I really didn’t want him following me again. Then I gathered up 
Mira’s letters, put them back in the box, and pulled on my boots. I 
continued down the road as fast as I could go. I didn’t want to have to 
sleep outside that night. Tonight I didn’t even have Giula to watch over me.

To my distress, I found no occupied farms before night fell. I finally pried a 
shutter off one of the abandoned houses and lit a fire in the hearth, so at 
least I’d be inside and have walls between me and the old man. The house 
was dark and empty, and the leaping fire cast eerie shadows on the walls. 
There was no furniture. I leaned against the wall by the fire, wrapped in 
my cloak.
Back when I was just twelve or thirteen, Bella used to tell Giula and me 
ghost stories, preferably when we slipped out of our rooms late at night 
and met in the grove behind the chapel. Bella was a superb storyteller, and 
even though I wasn’t as gullible as Giula, she had been able to make my 
hair stand on end. Snatches of Bella’s stories came back to me now, 
watching the shadows on the walls. If I’d ever been somewhere that might 
be haunted, this was it.
Don’t be ridiculous, I thought. Herennia and Metello set up house in an 
abandoned cottage just like this one and they don’t spend their nights 
sitting up, staring at shadows. I broke out my provisions and bit into a 
piece of cheese. Suddenly I was absolutely certain that the people who had 
lived here were dead. And then I was certain they were watching me, just 
like the girl Bella talked about who’d hanged herself from the last bough of 
the apple tree . . .
A log in the fire split with a snap and I nearly jumped out of my skin. This 
was ridiculous. I was not the sort of person who got jumpy. Still, I crossed 
myself like a granny, muttering the Old Tongue words under my breath, to 
keep away the evil eye. The ritual made me feel a bit better. Finishing my 
cheese, I banked the fire and curled up to go to sleep, staring into the 
darkness.

I stood in the doorway of the farmhouse. To the west, on the hill, I could 
see five figures silhouetted in the last of the afternoon light. Fear stabbed 
me through like a spear and I started to shout warning, but it was too 
late. Fire was falling from the sky. I could hear screams around me and I 
realized some of them were mine—
* * *
I woke with a gasp. Lady protect me. No, that wasn’t right. God protect me. 
The fire had gone out and I could see nothing in the darkness. I was 
trapped and dying—no, my cloak was wrapped around me, that was all—
the house was haunted—
I pulled one hand free of my cloak and cupped it to summon witchlight. I 
needed light to banish the spirits; what had my village priest and priestess 
taught me, when I was just a child? Light will banish the Maledori. Now 
that you can make witchlight, you can always chase the Maledori away. 
I concentrated, focused—
Darkness.
I concentrated.
Darkness.
My hands were shaking. Witchlight finally gleamed through my fingers, 
dim and greenish. Shadows leapt along the walls. I saw a woman, as tall 
and narrow as a spear, holding a violin, dancing in a circle of flame—I 
cupped my witchlight against my chest, willing it not to go out.
There was no way I could stay in here. Could it possibly be almost dawn? 
Still cupping my witchlight in my shaking hands, I grabbed all my

belongings into my arms and scrambled out the broken shutter.
As soon as I was out of the house, I felt calmer. The sky was just turning 
violet in the east; the morning star gleamed like a candle against mist. The 
air was frosty and it was still too dark to travel. I wrapped my cloak around 
me and sat down on the low wall around the abandoned farm to wait for 
dawn.
I was almost home now. Starting as early as I did, I could cover the final 
distance by late afternoon. My feet and shoulders were raw, but that 
wouldn’t matter if I were back with my family. Besides, as I walked, I 
traveled back into more fertile lands. Seeing lush fields again, I almost felt 
that I could draw my own strength from the renewed land. It was a 
beautiful day, with a clear blue sky and sunshine that warmed as the day 
went on. The light of the day almost dispelled the shadows of the night.
Doratura was a small village, just a cluster of houses and farms on the 
other side of a low hill. I recognized the hill as I drew close, in the deep 
shadows of afternoon. The trees on the ridge were stark against the blue 
sky.
Climbing the hill, I smelled something—ash, and old cooked meat. I 
suddenly remembered Mira’s description of the square in Cuore where the 
Fedeli executed heretics at the stake. It smells like cooked rotten meat. I 
shuddered— had the Fedeli been here? Executed someone in Doratura? I 
broke into a run, scrambling up the hill until I could see down into the 
village.
“Lady—” I whispered.
My village was gone.
I shook my head, unable to believe what I saw. The houses were charred

foundations, the fields black, the trees twisted. Magefire. Mages had done 
this. This had to be somebody else’s village, I thought. I had forgotten my 
way and wandered here by mistake. This had happened during the war, 
except that the ash was still fresh, the stench still potent.
“No,” I heard myself saying. “Lord and Lady ...” I started running, 
stumbling and nearly falling on the damp grass of the hillside. There were 
charred bones in the streets, bones in the doorways and courtyards of the 
houses, child-sized bones that had uselessly sought shelter behind trees, 
behind houses, in their mothers’ arms. I fixed my eyes on the ground 
under my feet, unwilling to look up. My family could not be—they couldn’t.
My house was on the far edge of the village. I could see it from the hill, but 
somehow I could refuse to believe until I stood among the charred ruins of 
my home, stared at the empty skeleton of the barn, the blackened fields. 
The stone foundations of my parents’ house still stood, and I stepped 
slowly over the threshold.
“Mother?” I whispered.
Doratura’s dead had been left where they fell; some had been blasted to 
ash by magefire, others had been picked over by scavengers. There were 
bones scattered through the house and yard, and as I stared around me, 
unable to believe what I saw, I realized that I didn’t even know whose 
bones were whose, where one body stopped and another started.
A breeze ruffled my hair and stirred the ashes around me like sand. I need 
to bury them, I thought. If I couldn’t be here to warn them—to die with 
them—I could at least bury their bodies. I let my violin and pack slip from 
my raw shoulders onto the stone doorstep. Tools were kept in the barn; if 
there was a shovel to find, it would be in there.

The animals had met the same fate as the people. As I sorted through the 
wreckage, I found a small skull that had probably belonged to a cat. It had 
hidden itself under a low shelf, uselessly seeking safety. I wondered if 
there were mouse skeletons in there as well, or if they’d managed to get 
away. Near the shelf, I found the scoop of a shovel. The wooden handle 
had burned away, but with effort, I could use the scoop to dig a grave.
I had to kneel to use it, in the yard outside the house. I decided to dig 
where the herb garden had been, because the soil would be softer there. It 
bruised the heels of my hands as I worked; I settled for scraping out a 
single shallow grave, then went to gather up the bones.
Since I could hold only a few fragments in my hands, I used my spare robe 
to gather up what was left. The task would have been easier with a broom, 
the fragments were so small and so scattered; what I scooped up with my 
hands was as much dust and ash as bone, but then, the ash was probably 
my family, too. I piled everything onto the robe and carried it to the grave.
Before I covered over the bones with dirt, I took out the wooden box of 
Mira’s letters. I was tired of carrying this. I set the box on top of the bones. 
I thought for a moment about shaking out the spare robe, but I couldn’t 
imagine ever wearing it again. After staring for a moment at the small 
heap of bone, rubble, and ash, I used the shovel to close the grave.
I still couldn’t believe that this was my village—my home—my family, until 
I returned to the doorstep, to gather up my violin and my bag. Nestled in 
the corner, between the doorstep and the foundation wall, was a tiny clay 
bird whistle, like the ones Donato used to make for me. I knelt to pick it 
up, and grief tore through me like a knife. Donato would have made this 
for his daughter, I knew. Now he was dead, and his wife and children with

him.
My hand shook, and the whistle fell to the ground and cracked. “Oh no!” I 
screamed. I fell to my knees and picked up the two pieces, trying uselessly 
to fit them together again. “No, no, no, why did I have to drop it? Why? 
No. Please—” I pressed the pieces back together. “Please don’t be broken. 
Please, please don’t be broken.”
I don’t know how long I wept in agony over the shards of the broken 
whistle, but when I stopped, it was quite dark. I would have to spend the 
night here, with the ghosts of my family. I spread out my cloak and sat 
down, wishing I had wood for a fire; the spring night was turning cool, but 
everything burnable in Doratura had already been consumed by the 
magefire.
Staring into the darkness, I realized there was one more thing I needed to 
do for my family. I took out my bow and tightened it, then tuned my violin 
and tucked it under my chin, rising to stare out over the broken fields into 
the darkness around me.
Da dat da da dat da wham wham wham. Da dat da da dat da wham 
wham wham. The rhythm of the funeral music didn’t echo against the dirt 
and ash that I stamped my foot against, but it echoed in my head, and as I 
closed my eyes, I imagined that Bella and Flavia were here to play with me.
I played the music through. Herennia had mentioned dances; my feet were 
too sore to dance as vigorously as I had that night in Bosco, but I moved in 
a slow circle as the girl there had shown me. Rigbt-pause-behind-pause. 
Right-pause-behind-pause. At least there was no one here to see me.
I’d had seven brothers, all married, all with children. Donato was the 
second oldest. He’d been delighted by the prospect of a younger sister after

all those boys; in addition to making me whistles and helping me climb 
trees, he’d taught me to fight well enough to beat any boy my age, even the 
one boy who was bigger than I was. Donato was less of a ruffian than our 
eldest brother, Agrippo; Donato’s wife, Imelda, was gentle and sweet with 
a wry sense of humor, the kind of woman who was impressed by kindness, 
not the ability to intimidate all other prospective suitors.
Gone, the song echoed.
My father was a big, quiet man. I’d gotten my height from him; he was 
taller than I was, taller than any man in the village except for Agrippo, who 
was a hair taller. My father had always been a little bewildered at the idea 
of a daughter; I’d catch him blinking at me like I was some sort of lost 
exotic bird that had flown to Verdia by mistake. When I was little, he 
would take me into his lap to tell me stories about Lugo, my grandfather’s 
youngest brother, who was blindingly stupid but always seemed to have 
things work out in his favor anyway.
Gone.
My mother—I realized I was crying, my hands shaking. I could barely hold 
my violin. I remembered my mother’s touch, gently combing the tangles 
out of my hair. Each year in late summer, when we celebrated the Birth of 
the World, she would snip off a lock of my hair to keep in a pouch that she 
wore around her neck, along with a lock of hair from each of my brothers. 
That way she could pray for us, even if we were far away. The night before 
I went away to the conservatory, I asked to see the contents of the pouch—
I wanted to be certain nothing had happened to the lock of my hair she 
had cut the previous summer.
She unlaced the soft circle of fabric and spread out the pouch on our table.

There were ten locks of hair. “This one is yours,” she said, pointing to a 
soft fawn-brown curl. “Agrippo’s, Donato’s, Rufo’s, Erucio’s, Lorenzo’s, 
Berio’s, Fiorenzo’s.”
“Who do these two belong to?” I asked, pointing at two tiny locks of silvery 
hair.
“I had two other children,” she said. “One between Agrippo and Donato, 
one just before you. They died when they were just babies.” She sighed and 
looked away. “I shouldn’t keep these—those children are with the Lady. 
But I can’t bear to give them up.”
Gone.
I couldn’t play anymore. I paused, lowering the bow, trying to keep back 
my sobs.
Somewhere beyond me in the darkness, I saw the faint outline of a figure. 
For a moment, I thought it was Donato’s ghost, but the shadow was far too 
tangible, and I realized that it was the madman from the road. His eyes 
were calm and he didn’t look at me. Half closing his eyes, he raised his 
hands as if to grasp invisible hands on either side of him, then began 
dancing, moving in a slow circle around the clearing. Step-pause-step step 
step turn, step. Step-pause-step step step turn, step.
Instead of feeling frightened, this time I felt oddly comforted. I lifted the 
bow again and began playing. Da dat da da dat da wham wham wham. 
Step-pause-step step step turn, step. The madman danced silently, except 
for the soft crunch of leaves underfoot. My hands were shaking again, but I 
was able to hold the violin steady enough to play the music through twice 
more. When I finished, I almost dropped the violin as I bowed my head, 
my body shaking with sobs. When I looked up, the madman was gone. Still

shaking, I put the violin away, and curled up in my cloak. I had no one to 
watch over me, but the madman didn’t frighten me anymore.
This is all a dream, I told myself, as I stared up at the stars. If only I go to 
sleep, I will wake up, and find myself back in that empty house, or with 
Herennia and Metello. Or at the conservatory, with Mira beside me. But I 
was too cold to sleep. And too alone.
At dawn, I rose and walked to the next village, Gervala, which was a few 
miles away. I don’t know what I would have done if I’d found another 
burned-out dead village, but Gervala was untouched. I went to the door of 
the first house I came to and knocked.
A woman opened the door a crack and peered out. “Who are you?”
“My name is Eliana—I’m from Doratura—”
She slammed the door closed. “Go away,” she said, her voice muffled 
behind the door.
“What happened?” I cried. “What happened? Everything’s gone.” There 
was no response, and I pounded on the door. “Open the door!” I screamed. 
“Tell me what happened to my village!”
The door opened again, and I half fell into the doorway. “Come in, then,” 
the woman hissed, and I limped inside.
She did not invite me past the threshold. “There were refugees from the 
wasteland,” she said. “They came up, trying to go north. Doratura took 
them in.” Her voice was scornful. “This was just a place to rest, they 
weren’t going to stay here. But soldiers came to meet them on the road, to 
turn them back. The refugees wouldn’t go home. The soldiers pushed them 
back to Doratura, the refugees fighting them the whole way. So then two

weeks ago, the mages came.” She shuddered involuntarily. “Just five of 
them. They stood on the hill that overlooks the village and . . . they burned 
everything. They killed everyone.”
“Everyone?” I whispered.
“There were a few survivors. They took them south, to Ravenna—it’s an 
encampment for refugees, deep in the wasteland. And a prison, I guess, for 
the ones who make trouble.” Her eyes hardened. “Now leave. I’ve told you 
everything I know.”
“My family,” I said. “Regillo and Marisa. Do you know if—”
“Go away!” she said, and struck me, shoving me out the door. She 
slammed it in my face.
I was alone in the damp morning. I tried knocking on another door, but 
this time no one answered. Eventually, the Gervalesi would have to come 
out to do their morning chores, but so long as I was there, apparently, they 
would sit inside with their doors barred.
Very well then, I thought. I needed more food; most of the provisions I had 
purchased in Pluma were gone. I could steal from the Gervalesi without 
feeling particularly guilty about it. I pried open one family’s storehouse 
and stole grain and dried fruit, and refilled my wineskin from their wine 
barrels. Their early spring stores were low, but not too low. I was quite 
certain they were watching me, but no one came. They were afraid of me, I 
knew—an angry orphan with nothing to lose, but worse, a symbol of their 
own shame. When I had taken all I could carry, I left the village.
Back on the road, I realized I had no idea where to go now. But the woman 
had said that they took the survivors south. I had not been able to identify 
the bodies as I buried them. Maybe someone in my family had survived.

CHAPTER EIGHT
contents - previous | next 
 
 
The children of the Light must stand together, for all others will stand 
against them. 
 
—The Journey of Gèsu, chapter 11, verse 26. 
 
 
By morning, I had moved on, but I could barely walk. By midmorning I 
had reached an abandoned farm. I broke into the barn—I felt like it would 
be less likely to be haunted—and decided I’d spend a day or two there to 
let my feet heal. Now that I was alone, really alone, my thoughts were 
deafeningly loud. I tried to find tasks to occupy myself—getting water to 
wash my feet, mending a ripped seam in the edge of my bag, tuning my 
violin—but nothing seemed to drown them out.
Except for the day that my father took me to see the mage who’d given me 
apples even though I couldn’t burn stone, I had rarely thought much about 
the Circle before the war. To play for the Circle was the highest position a 
musician could hold, and back at the conservatory I had sometimes 
imagined myself playing in Cuore, closing my eyes as I practiced and 
imagining the glitter of a banquet hall in place of the gray stone walls 
around me. In the shadowed barn, I lay back and stared at the rafters, then

closed my eyes, imagining myself back at the conservatory.
The Emperor rules, the Circle protects, the Fedeli guide. I could hear 
Domenico’s even voice, and Bella’s challenge, and I wondered if Domenico 
really believed what he’d told us. And whether he still believed it now.
During the war, I’d felt a new respect for the Circle, and for the protection 
they offered us. We had gone to war with Vesuvia after their cross-border 
raids had led to atrocities, with families burned with their crops. The war 
had raged for two full years, with neither army advancing more than a few 
miles except on rare occasions. In the end, the border was left more or less 
where it had been before. Army detachments were left to keep an eye on 
things and the Circle retreated to Cuore. The Circle protects. Opening my 
eyes again, I stared up into the dark rafters. Some birds had gotten in and 
built nests; I could hear the squawk of squabbling fledglings, and see the 
flutter of wings. Who had been there to protect my family? What the 
Vesuviani had done was nothing compared to what the Circle had done. 
My mouth turned bitter and I almost retched. I closed my eyes again.
I briefly considered returning to the conservatory. The Dean wasn’t 
supposed to take me back, but he’d bent the rules before. And under the 
circumstances . . . but no. If I became a student at the conservatory again, 
it would be under the sponsorship of the Circle. I’d rather starve, I 
thought. Besides, I couldn’t imagine being sequestered again. I was part of 
the world now, for better or worse.
I sat up after a while, and eased my boots off to take a look at my feet. I 
had worn away big strips of skin, and those parts were raw and bloody. I 
wet the edge of my cloak and wrapped my feet in it; the cold water might 
bring some of the swelling down. I hoped the cloak would dry by evening.

I stayed at the abandoned farm for almost a week, eating the provisions I’d 
stolen from Gervala. I stayed in the barn during the day, limping out at 
night to fetch more water as necessary. I was afraid that someone from 
Gervala might see me and bring a group of people down to punish me for 
stealing food. At least the former residents of the farm refrained from 
haunting me. Perhaps they were satisfied that I was staying in the barn, or 
perhaps they felt sorry for me.
I thought about the Circle a great deal, and Mira, and Bella and Giula. I 
managed not to think about the ashes of the house, the wreckage, the 
bones of my family.
As soon as I had skin on my feet again, I padded my feet carefully, 
gathered my belongings, and moved on. I passed through villages that day, 
but no one would meet my eyes. My first thought was that they could tell I 
was a thief, but I realized quickly that my ragged clothes and hopeless 
wariness marked me as a refugee. Refugees brought danger; they knew 
what had happened to that village just to the north. A young child asked 
her mother why I was walking south—“Nobody goes south, do they?”—but 
she was quickly hushed, and her mother made a sign to ward off the evil 
eye as I passed.
The land died around me as I walked. That first day, I had been in territory 
that had never seen war. The second day, I saw farms that had been 
burned in the war, but had since been rebuilt; the landscape was scarred, 
with dead trees, but the spring flowers were in bloom and the fields were 
green. The third day, I saw shrunken weeds and withered flowers; when I 
knocked on the door of a farmhouse, no one answered.
On the fourth day, I came to the wasteland.

The wasteland was just on our side of the border with Vesuvia. The war 
had raged there for more than a year, with each army pushing forward just 
a few miles, then falling back again. The people who lived in that part of 
Verdia fled the fighting during the war, trying to get out of the way of the 
armies. Some of them never came back. They made the right choice.
Not even weeds grew in the wasteland. The fields were black, or baked 
sand-brown by the sun. I felt as exposed as a rabbit on the treeless plain, 
and quickly grew hot in the sun. Streams still ran through the wasteland, 
but the water tasted strangely bitter, and I found myself wanting to rinse 
my mouth with the last of my wine, just to get rid of the taste.
As I rested in the shade of a ruined barn, a column of refugees passed by. 
Guarded by soldiers, they were being marched south.
“Hey there!” one of the soldiers called when he spotted me. “Where do you 
think you’re going?”
“Ravenna,” I said.
The soldiers laughed. “You don’t go to Ravenna,” one said. “You get taken 
there.”
“So, do you have any other recommendations?” I asked.
“You’re pretty much out of options, at this point,” he said with a shrug. 
“Our orders are to bring in anyone we find, no matter where they say 
they’re going.”
“What if someone wants to stay with their farm?” I asked. That was really 
hilarious; the soldiers laughed again.
“Where are you from, girl?” one of the refugees asked as I joined the 
column of marchers. “Not from around here, that’s obvious.”

“I was at a conservatory until recently,” I said. “I came home to find my 
village burned. I heard that the survivors were taken to Ravenna. I’m 
looking for my family.”
He sobered. “Which village?”
“Doratura. Have there been so many?”
“Enough. I don’t know anyone from Doratura. It may be that only refugees 
survived. That happens sometimes.” He patted my shoulder apologetically. 
“Good luck to you, though.”
We reached Ravenna in late afternoon. Ravenna itself was a valley of 
blackened earth and ragged makeshift tents made of blankets and stitched-
together cloaks. Three buildings stood in the center of Ravenna: a keep, a 
barracks, and a stable.
A fence ran along the hills surrounding the valley, golden in the setting 
sun. Sticks had been planted in crossed X’s, set close together; it was the 
sort of arrangement used to block a cavalry charge, but in this case it had 
been designed simply to keep the Ravenessi from leaving. The fence could 
not possibly be all that sturdy—it would be easy enough to work one of the 
sticks loose—but I could see patrols of soldiers along the edge as well.
“They shoot on sight if you try to leave,” the refugee whispered to me. “So 
if you make a run for it, do it after dark, on a moonless night, and hope the 
soldiers don’t see you.”
Just beyond the valley, draped with shadows, I could see a wall, winding 
past the camp like a gray river until it was hidden from view by the rise of 
another hill.
“What is that?” I asked.

“That’s the wall,” the refugee said. “That’s what Ravenna is for. The Circle 
wants a wall built along the border, to protect us from the Vesuviani.” 
Below us, the workers had finished for the day; I saw no signs of life by the 
wall, but a long line had formed below us in Ravenna, and I could see a 
large pot over the flicker of a single fire.
The soldiers led us down into the sea of tents. The camp looked worse 
close up; many of the “tents” were simply cloaks staked up, barely waist-
high. Except for the single road that passed through to the keep, the tents 
were crammed together so tightly I’d have to turn sideways to pass 
between them. People came out of their tents to stare as we passed. Their 
eyes and cheeks were hollow. I could feel their eyes burning into me, and I 
tried to stand up straighter, to show that I was not afraid.
“Hey,” one of the soldiers said. “Here.” He handed me a string, with fifteen 
chips of wood strung along it. A small star had been burned into each, and 
a hole cut in the center for the string. “Ration chits.” I stared at the wood 
chips stupidly, and he sighed. “One chit gets you breakfast, one dinner. 
This is a week’s worth. Once you start working you’ll be able to earn more, 
but—I thought I’d let you get settled in.”
I slipped the string over my head and tucked the chits inside my shirt, next 
to Bella’s cross.
“Stay out of trouble,” he continued. “Anyone tries to steal from you, or 
tries to make trouble with you—well, you can come find me. My name’s 
Mario. Don’t get into fights—Teleso doesn’t give a rat’s ass who started it, 
if you’re found fighting.”
“Who’s Teleso?” I asked.
“The camp commander, and you don’t want to piss him off—got that?”

Mario clasped my shoulder briefly. “They’re serving dinner now,” he said. 
“You should go line up and get some.”
The light was fading from the sky. “I gather I am not permitted to leave?” I 
asked.
“No one is allowed to leave,” he said.
“I thought slavery was against the Law of the Lady,” I said softly.
“You’re not a slave,” Mario said. “No one will make you work.”
“But I’m not allowed to leave,” I said. “And if I don’t work, I don’t get any 
food.”
Mario looked wounded—I was a bit startled, as I hadn’t honestly expected 
my snide comments to make much of an impact. “I’m sorry,” he said softly. 
“I hope you find your family.”
I joined the long line of people, shuffling slowly forward. The bravado I’d 
felt earlier had evaporated like the last of the life from the fields around 
me. Whatever I was going to do now, I could do after I’d eaten. I’d finished 
the last of my provisions that morning.
As the twilight deepened into night, I realized that I had never been 
anywhere so dark in my life. Torches burned near the front of the line, but 
that seemed to be the only light in Ravenna. I cupped my hand and tried to 
summon witchlight, just to be able to see the people around me, but 
nothing happened.
“Doesn’t work,” the person behind me grunted. “No magery works here.”
Even on moonless nights on my parents’ farm, I had been able to summon 
witchlight to light my way. Anywhere but the wasteland, a crowd this size 
would be lit with hundreds of tiny lights, cupped to illumine conversations

and to keep people from tripping over the uneven ground. Here, the 
torches cast only a small circle of light, and there was almost no moon.
It was a long, chilly wait. I pulled my cloak around me, but still could not 
get warm. The food, when I finally reached the head of the line, was a thin 
gruel. I surrendered a chit and they filled my bowl. I was ravenous, and 
moved only a little way from the soldiers serving the food to take out my 
spoon and eat it. I scraped the bowl clean with my fingers, but was left 
hungry, even so.
As I watched, scraping out my empty bowl, a boy dodged in between the 
soldiers, grabbing a handful of wooden ration chits from the barrel by the 
cauldron of food. “Hey!” one of the soldiers yelled, giving the boy a cuff to 
the head that sent him sprawling.
“Let him go, Niccolo,” the other soldier urged in a whisper. “Just get the 
chits and let him run. He’s only a boy.”
“Not bloody likely,” Niccolo hissed back, hauling the boy up by his collar. 
“I’m turning this runt over to Teleso. They’re all thieves, and I’ve had 
enough of them.” The other soldier watched helplessly as Niccolo stalked 
off into the darkness, hauling the boy behind him. I watched a moment 
longer, then went to find somewhere to sleep.
In the darkness, there was no way I could navigate the sea of tents. I 
continued down the path, past the keep and toward the far edge of the 
valley. I finally came to an edge where there was a little space and lay 
down, wrapped in my cloak. I was exhausted, but I couldn’t sleep. The 
ground felt harder than any hearthstone. I rolled onto my back and looked 
at the sky.
The sky was very clear that night, and the moon was a narrow crescent. It

occurred to me that there were more stars than I could normally see. 
When I went out at night, I usually held some witchlight to see my way, 
and that clouded my night vision; here, I couldn’t make witchlight at all, so 
there was nothing to keep me from seeing the stars. In places, I couldn’t 
see individual stars, but there was a misty white glow. The sky was 
beautiful, but oddly threatening. I thought of the Redentore God, who 
Giorgi said sent pain as well as joy; I could imagine Her creating such a sky 
simply to impress upon me how small I was. I stared at the stars for a long 
time before my weariness pulled me down into restless sleep.
I was stiff and cold when I got up in the morning, and damp with dew. To 
my relief, no one had stolen my violin or my chits. Everyone seemed to be 
heading to the food line, so I joined in the slow shuffle. I had risen early, so 
I got my breakfast—more gruel—a bit faster than I’d gotten my dinner. 
When I’d finished the last of it, I wandered around Ravenna a bit, hoping 
to see a familiar face.
There was a little bit more to Ravenna than I’d seen the previous night. In 
addition to the keep and the sea of tents, there were occasional bits of 
stone walls. Ravenna had been a town once; destroyed in the war, bits and 
pieces remained and were used to hold up some of the tents.
Things were packed so tightly that anywhere I went off the main road, I 
felt that I was trespassing on someone’s territory. People were still staring 
at me, and an old woman glared as I stepped over the edge of her tent. 
Finally, I returned to the piazza next to the keep; at least this didn’t seem 
to belong to anybody.
A thick pillar of wood stood in front of the keep; iron rings were screwed to 
the sides, on level with my head. It looked like a permanent installation,

but I’d missed it last night in the dark. As I studied the pillar, a door in the 
side of the keep swung open, and four soldiers led out a struggling boy. It 
was the boy I’d seen yesterday trying to steal ration chits. One of the 
soldiers unbelted the boy’s tunic and tried to pull it off, but he continued 
to struggle and almost slipped out of their hands, so the soldiers bound his 
hands to the iron rings on the pillar and then tore his tunic open to bare 
his back. One of the soldiers read from a parchment: “For attempted theft 
of ration chits. Fifteen lashes.” The boy cried out, though the lash hadn’t 
touched him yet.
Three of the soldiers returned to the keep; the fourth picked up a long 
whip and brought it down on the boy’s back. The snap echoed across the 
piazza and the boy screamed. His cry was echoed by a woman watching—
his mother? She clapped her hands over her mouth and moaned in 
anguish, watching the lashing.
I didn’t want to see this, but I stood frozen, counting the blows. The boy 
went limp as they finished. They cut the bonds and pushed him away from 
the whipping post; the woman rushed forward to gather him up. I could 
hear a low moan from the boy. The soldiers coiled the whip and went back 
into the keep. No one else in Ravenna seemed to have noticed.
With my week’s worth of ration chits, I had no need to go work on the wall, 
but within a few hours, I realized that I was terribly, stunningly bored. 
There were a surprising number of other Ravenessi who didn’t seem to be 
working, either. I found out later that many fed themselves some other way
—begging, prostitution, theft, or the largesse of family. The children, 
elderly, and ill were forced to rely on this, but there were other able-bodied 
young people as well, sitting around and killing time. We had no fields to

tend, no crafts to occupy our hands, nothing to do at all except stand in 
line for food twice a day and wait for death by slow starvation. By 
midmorning, I was hungry again. I drank some water to give me the 
feeling of fullness for a little while.
It had been a few days since I’d played the violin. At least practicing would 
give me a way to pass the hours until dinner. Sitting in the spot where I’d 
slept, I took out my violin and tuned up. I played my half of the duet I’d 
played with Giula, then my section of the ensemble piece we’d been 
working on right when I left the conservatory. Around me, people ducked 
out of their tents, staring at me. I flushed slightly, but ignored them and 
kept playing. Some settled down in the dirt across from me, and others 
began to clap time with my playing. I realized, with no little surprise, that 
they were listening to me for pleasure.
I hadn’t played for such an uncritical audience since my mother became a 
sophisticated enough listener to evaluate my technique, back when I was 
just a child. At the conservatory, I never listened to another violinist 
without quietly noticing every mistake, every fumble, every note I could 
have played better, and I knew the other violinists returned the favor. In 
Ravenna, though, people seemed to view my playing as high 
entertainment. An old woman closed her eyes, a slight smile on her face, 
and one or two people got up to dance. Nothing formal like the Redentore 
dance I’d seen; they just wanted to move to the music. I almost started 
enjoying myself; it was nice to feel like a concert star. I segued into some of 
the folk songs I’d played with Mira, and people sang along. There was 
some inconsistency in the words they sang, but no one seemed to notice.
I scanned the faces of the audience as I played, hoping to see someone I

knew. I caught a glimpse, in the late afternoon, of a young man who looked 
familiar, but he was gone before I could place him. My first impulse was to 
race after him, but I couldn’t just leave my violin case and bag behind, and 
by the time I gathered everything up, he’d be long gone. Besides, thinking 
it over, I was fairly certain he wasn’t from my village. If I knew him, I knew 
him from somewhere else.
People began lining up for dinner just before the work crews were 
expected back, in late afternoon. I joined the line soon after that; I was 
ravenous. The soldiers hadn’t started serving the food yet, so the line 
wasn’t moving, but at least close to the head of the line, I’d get fed sooner.
“Hey,” a voice said behind me. “You’re new here, aren’t you?”
I turned. The young woman behind me in line was as thin and ragged as 
anyone else here, but she had an inner warmth that lit her eyes with life. 
She smiled kindly, the first welcoming look I’d seen in weeks. “You are 
new,” she said, without waiting for my response. “I’d know you, if you 
weren’t.”
“You’re right,” I said. “I am new here.”
“My name is Lucia,” she said.
“Eliana.”
“Where did you come from? You haven’t been living in the wasteland.”
“Doratura. I’m looking for my family.”
“Doratura,” she said. “Where were you before that?”
“Conservatory.”
“Ah, yes. That explains the violin case.” She touched my arm gently. 
“Doratura was destroyed by the Circle— you knew that, yes?”

“Yes.” My voice nearly caught, and I cleared my throat. “A woman in the 
neighboring village told me that soldiers took the survivors south, to 
Ravenna.”
Lucia nodded. “That’s right. There were ten survivors from Doratura who 
were brought here, plus three of the refugees that they had sheltered.”
Hope leapt in my throat and blinded me. “What were their names? Can 
you tell me?”
She closed her eyes a moment. “From Doratura—Bino, Adria, and their 
children Idi, Pamfilo, and Masina; Eleanora, and her son Duilio; a man 
named Alessandro; and two orphan children, Neri and Balbo.”
I remembered Bino and Adria, Eleanora and Alessandro. Bino had been a 
good friend of my father’s. Alessandro once brawled with my eldest 
brother Agrippo over a girl; they’d both wound up with cracked heads, and 
the girl decided they were both louts and married someone else. I realized 
dimly through my sobs that Lucia was holding me up; I had not even 
realized that she’d slipped her arm around my waist to support me.
“Let me go,” I choked. I wanted to get away from the crowd, to cry 
somewhere more private, where no one could stare at me.
“Stay here,” she said. “You don’t want to lose your place in line.” I 
struggled, against her and against my own uncooperative legs, but she held 
me firmly. “You need to eat,” she said. “You’ll need all of your strength. 
And don’t give up hope. Those were the survivors brought here. If any of 
your relatives were gone from the village when the Circle attacked, they 
might have fled and avoided both death and capture.”
“Perhaps.” I could almost stand again. “Alessandro and the others. Where 
are they now?”

I could feel her arm tighten around me again. “They escaped a few nights 
ago,” she whispered. “All of them. Your village sticks together.”
My knees held, this time, and I found myself laughing. “So now I’m truly 
alone.”
“You’re not alone,” she said. “God is with you.”
I stiffened, then straightened up slowly and turned to look carefully into 
her face. Lucia looked steadily back at me. After a moment, she let go of 
my waist and took my hand. “You’re one of us, aren’t you?” she said, and 
traced a cross on my skin. I jumped, starting to pull away, and she 
squeezed my hand. “Don’t be afraid,” she said. “The Fedeli don’t come to 
Ravenna. This is perhaps the safest place in all the Empire to be a 
Redentore.” She smiled at the irony and I gave her a tentative grimace 
back.
“Why do you know everyone here?” I asked.
Lucia smiled, and again her eyes lit like candles behind a screen. “It’s not 
such a big valley, really,” she said. “I try to meet people as they come in.”
“Where are you from?” I asked.
“Varena,” she said, and my face must have shown my surprise, because she 
shrugged and added, “It’s a long story.” Varena was weeks north of here—
even further north than Cuore. “Where did you go to conservatory?” she 
asked.
“The Verdiano Rural Conservatory. In Bascio.”
The line began to shuffle forward. “Hey,” Lucia said. “Why don’t you join 
me while we eat? There are some friends I’d like to introduce you to.”
In the torchlight at the head of the food line, I noticed that Lucia’s eyes

were a beautiful deep blue. Where had I seen eyes that color before? I 
couldn’t remember. “I’d love to,” I said.
The tent Lucia led me to was a little larger and more solid-looking than the 
tents around it. The residents seemed to have claimed at least one solid 
wall and pulled down their canvas over the edge. Lucia stuck her hand 
through the flap and waved. “Rafi,” she said. “It’s Lucia. I’ve brought a 
friend.”
Rafi flipped the tent flap back and peered out. He had a shock of curly 
black hair and long black lashes. “Come on in,” he said.
There were four people in the tent: Rafi, a beautiful young woman, and 
two men. “Move over, Giovanni,” Lucia said to one of the men.
“For what?” he demanded. “Some other bloody stray you’ve picked up?” 
Giovanni looked up to glare at me and I realized with a sickening drop of 
my stomach who he was.
“You,” I gasped. This was who I saw while playing earlier.
“Giovanni of Cuore,” he said, looking at me nervously. “What do you 
mean, ‘you’?”
It was the violet-eyed pretty-boy from the inn in Pluma. The louse who’d 
slapped Giula. “Never mind,” I said. “If you don’t remember, there 
certainly isn’t any point in reminding you.”
He continued to stare at me for a moment, and I gave him my most 
threatening glare. “Oh!” he said suddenly. “From Pluma.”
“Yeah,” I said. “From Pluma.”
“This is Eliana,” Lucia introduced me, completely ignoring Giovanni’s 
outburst. I realized where I’d seen her blue eyes before. They were the

same color as Giovanni’s. “She’s the one I heard playing violin earlier 
today.” There was an approving murmur through the tent, though not 
from Giovanni.
“I still don’t see any reason that I should move over,” Giovanni said.
“Shut up, Giovanni,” the other man said, rising slightly to bow to me. “My 
name is Beneto, and this—” he gestured to the beautiful woman, “is Jesca. 
It’s a pleasure to welcome you to our tent, although we could choose more 
hospitable surroundings.” He gave me a charming smile, then glared at 
Giovanni, who moved out of the way to let Lucia and me sit down.
Beneto was startlingly clean, cleaner than anyone I’d seen since I’d arrived 
at Ravenna, and his clothes were cut just a little too nicely—as if he had 
gone to the best tailor in a substantial city and said, “Make me peasants’ 
clothes.” Jesca was Beneto’s quiet shadow, with a gentle smile that could 
melt marble. She was just dusty enough not to stand out like a duck in a 
henhouse, but the worn elbows of her dress were carefully mended and her 
long, straight hair was brushed smooth.
“Tea?” Rafi asked. “It’s not exactly the best Verdia has to offer, but it’ll be 
hot.” Rafi, at least, looked like an ordinary Ravenesse, and it was clear that 
this was his tent. He wore a cross openly on a leather thong; it dangled 
over his dishes as he bent to get cups.
“Yes, please,” Lucia said, and Beneto and Jesca nodded, so I nodded as 
well. Giovanni was still busy sulking and didn’t answer.
Rafi lit a tiny fire, using flint and steel, and set a pot over it. Beneto was 
studying me. “Do you think this is the one Amedeo spoke of, Lucia?” he 
asked.
“Well, he was speaking pretty, ah, poetically,” Lucia said. “But she seems

right.”
Beneto nodded, giving me a long, meditative look. I met his eyes with a 
glare. I don’t like being stared at, especially by someone who’s talking 
about me as if I’m not there. He looked slightly surprised, then smiled 
warmly. “She’s the one.”
“The one what?” I demanded.
“Your arrival here was not entirely unanticipated,” Beneto said. “Amedeo 
is a prophet. He’s a little, well, unstable. I don’t know if you’ve met a 
prophet before—”
“No.”
“They say that the Light is too bright for anyone to hold by himself,” Rafi 
said.
“Which is a polite way of saying Amedeo is crazy,” Giovanni said, poking at 
the fire. “Rafi, did you make enough tea for me?”
Rafi rolled his eyes. “I should say no. But yes, I did.” He checked the pot. 
“And it’s ready.” He filled the cups and passed them around. I cupped my 
hands around my tea. It smelled good, but it was weak and bitter. At least 
it was hot.
“Amedeo said you’d be coming. Or rather, he predicted a musician, ‘as tall 
and straight as a tree in winter,’ and he said you’d have the Gift,” Lucia 
said.
“What gift?”
Beneto shrugged. “We don’t have the slightest idea. Amedeo seemed to 
think it was very important, though.”
Lucia shrugged as well. “Although, as Giovanni noted so tactfully, Amedeo

is crazy. Sometimes what he says is inspired, and sometimes it’s just 
ravings. He’s not an especially easy man to be around.” She looked a little 
uncomfortable. “In any case, I think it is God’s will that you’re here.”
“Whatever,” Giovanni said. “I think it’s the Circle’s will that brought her, 
like the rest of us, to this godforsaken desert of a valley. And it’s Lucia’s 
will that brought her to Rafi’s tent.” He turned to glare at me again. 
“Peasant.” He said it as an insult.
“May I remind you whose tent you are in?” Rafi said. “My origins are also 
somewhat humbler than yours.”
“If you aren’t a peasant, then what are you doing here?” I asked Giovanni. 
“I saw you in Pluma. But you claim to be from Cuore. So what are you 
doing here?” For a heartbeat, I wondered if he was another runaway mage.
Giovanni opened his mouth to answer but Lucia cut him off. “Shut up, 
Giovanni,” she said. “Get out of here. Go for a walk. I want to talk to Eliana 
without your constant interruptions.”
“Why can’t you go for a walk then?” he said.
“That’s an order, Giovanni,” Jesca said. It was the first I’d heard her speak. 
She had a deep, melodious voice. Giovanni stomped out with a curse word. 
“Charming boy,” Jesca said. “Beneto and I will go, too, Lucia. I think 
Eliana is probably feeling a bit overwhelmed.” She smiled at Lucia, then 
turned to me. “It was a pleasure to meet you, Eliana,” she said. She clasped 
my hand briefly, and I noticed that her hands were as soft and delicate as a 
baby’s. Beneto clasped my hand as well; he had calluses, but they were in 
the wrong spots for farm work. Beneto and Jesca ducked out of the tent, 
leaving me alone with Rafi and Lucia.
In the silence that followed, I picked up Lucia’s hand and flipped it over to

study her palm. Her hands were cal-lused, like a peasant’s, but small and 
slender. Her skin was brown, her hair bleached to straw from the sun. “But 
you come from Varena,” I said. “What are you doing down here?”
“I came down before the war,” she said. “Several years before.”
“Why?”
“I got into a bit of trouble.” There was a hint of satisfaction in her voice. 
“The Fedeli wound up not at all pleased with me. Fortunately, I skipped 
town before they could arrest me.”
“But all the way down here?”
“I came to learn the Redentore music,” she said. “And the dances.”
My heart quickened when she mentioned the music, and I felt my cheeks 
flush slightly. Lucia watched me carefully, gauging my reaction. “You also 
feel their power, don’t you?” she said.
I nodded, not speaking.
“Do you know songs, or dances, or both?” Lucia asked.
“In the conservatory, many people played the music secretly. I know six 
songs. I don’t know any dances. Or, actually—I passed through a village 
while I was traveling. They had a festival and sang songs to the Lady, but 
they used an Old Way melody. And they danced.”
“That’s very common,” Lucia said. “There are also towns where they 
dance, but with different music. Or sing, but without dancing. That’s why I 
came to Verdia. To learn everything, to piece it together.” Her eyes 
sparkled in the dim tent.
“How many songs are there?” I asked.
“Hundreds,” Lucia said, and she smiled at the flush that rose to my cheeks

again. “I can teach you the songs, if you’d like.”
“But there’s nowhere private here to play,” I said. “If I play the music, 
everyone will hear.”
“Teleso likes to say that the Fedeli don’t rule here, he does,” Lucia said. 
“And when it comes to Redentore practice, he doesn’t give a rat’s ass, as 
long as it keeps people quiet.”
Ran laughed bitterly. “Just wait till the next time he needs an excuse for a 
massacre.” I jumped—Ran had been so quiet I’d almost forgotten he was 
there.
Lucia looked at him sharply. “This is Jesca’s theory, not mine,” Ran said. 
“Come on! Everyone knows that he gets a set amount of food to ration to 
everyone in Ravenna. Are you saying that some of those riots weren’t 
provoked?” Lucia didn’t answer, and Rafi went back to cleaning out the 
teapot.
“Through the music and the dances, God pours out Her light into the 
world,” Lucia said. “I will teach you the songs, if you will play them for our 
rituals.” Lucia looked across the tent at Rafi. “God has not forsaken us; She 
dances with us, even here.” She looked back at me. “And don’t worry. You 
can play them openly in Ravenna.”
“All right,” I said. “You teach me, I’ll play.”
Lucia gave me a brilliant smile. “Good,” she said.
Neither of us spoke for a minute.
“You still haven’t answered my question to Giovanni,” I said. “What’s he 
doing down here? And Beneto and Jesca. They aren’t peasants either.”
Lucia drained the last of her cup of tea and wiped out the cup, then studied

the ground for a moment. “Had you and Giovanni met before?” she asked.
“Yes,” I said. “When I was passing through Pluma, he accused a friend of 
mine of spying on him, and slapped her. He terrified Giula.”
Lucia sighed. “Giovanni has all the charm of a leashed dog that’s been 
kicked too often,” she said. “He’s hostile and suspicious with everyone. 
Which is basically why he’s down here.”
“I don’t understand.”
Lucia didn’t elaborate right away; she looked at Rafi, who checked outside 
the tent, then came back in and nodded. “I think you should tell her,” Rafi 
said. “If she’s to be playing for you, she has every right to know.”
Lucia nodded, then took my hand again. “Beneto, Jesca, and Giovanni are 
the local leaders for the organized reform movement,” she said.
“The what?”
“There is a group, organized from Cuore, that is trying to restore the 
Empire as it was before the Circle,” Lucia said. “Do you know what caused 
the famine?”
I nodded. “Magefire.”
“More and more people are realizing that,” Lucia said, “but to say it aloud 
in Cuore invites a death sentence. The Circle will never relinquish their 
power voluntarily, and they will never stop what they do, no matter what 
the price. Through their magic, and their cruelty, they have condemned 
everyone in Ravenna to slow death by starvation.” She flushed with anger, 
and paused to collect her thoughts. “The reform movement began at the 
university. That’s where Beneto, Jesca, and Giovanni met.”
“So they were sent down to Ravenna to organize the people here?”

“Beneto and Jesca were sent to Ravenna to organize,” Lucia said. 
“Giovanni was sent to Ravenna because no one in Cuore could stand him.” 
She sighed, her eyes on Ran. “It’s my fault, in a way. The organizers in 
Cuore used me as an excuse; I’m his cousin. ‘You already have family down 
there.’ So of course Giovanni blames me, and so do Jesca and Beneto and 
Rafi...”
“That’s not true,” Rafi scolded. “I don’t think Jesca blames you.”
Cousins, I thought. That explained the eye color.
“He’s harmless, really,” Lucia said. “Useless, but Beneto and Jesca keep 
him in line.”
“On a short leash, you might say,” Rafi said.
I laughed. My head was spinning.
“So,” Lucia said, and clasped my hand more tightly. “Now you know. I 
hope we haven’t misjudged you—you aren’t going to run off and tell 
Teleso?” I shook my head. “But we need you, Eliana,” Lucia said. “We need 
you on our side. We need you to be one of us.”
“Why?” I asked. “What is it you want from me?”
“Your music,” she said. “And—Amedeo believes you’re important. We 
don’t know why, not yet, but—I know we need you.”
“I said I’d play for you,” I said. “I haven’t changed my mind.”
Lucia smiled at me, and again her face lit like the evening star. “Thank 
you,” she said.
I spent the night in Rafi’s tent, squeezed in between Lucia and Beneto. 
Giovanni slept on the other side of Jesca, as far away from me as he could 
get. Despite the crowding, I slept later and more soundly than I had

outside, where I was woken by the light and activity at dawn.
Beneto and Jesca were up and gone by the time I woke; I found out later 
that they did not work on the wall. Giovanni had just begun to stir as Lucia 
and I got up, glaring at us from below his drooping lashes. Lucia and I left 
him rubbing the sleep out of his eyes while we lined up to get breakfast. 
“You can leave your violin and your cloak here,” Rafi said. “I’ll take care of 
them.” I left my cloak and bag behind, but took my violin with me. I liked 
Rafi, but I wasn’t leaving my violin anywhere.
“We’re celebrating Mass this afternoon,” Lucia said.
I gave her an uncertain look. “Celebrating what?”
Lucia was startled. “You haven’t celebrated Mass before? But you are one 
of us, I know that. How much do you know about the Old Way?”
I shook my head. “I learned some songs and prayers at the conservatory, 
before the Fedeli came and scared everyone too badly to play Old Way 
music even in secret. While I was coming home, I saw a little bit of a ritual 
in the woods—and one of the farmers I stayed with had a woman come to 
‘seal’ me.”
“That’s all?”
I nodded. “There’s no way you could play a song here without everyone 
hearing. How can you do an Old Way ritual in the camp?”
“The Fedeli don’t come here,” Lucia said.
“You said that before,” I said. “How can you be so sure?”
Lucia grinned broadly. “Nobody comes down here if they can help it. And 
the followers of the Lady are afraid of the wasteland, because magery 
doesn’t work.”

“There must be priestesses and priests here,” I said.
“Of course,” Lucia said. “But they’re refugees, and stuck here just like the 
rest of us. Even if they complain to Teleso, he’s happy enough to have us 
squabbling among ourselves.” The food line had stopped moving, and 
Lucia craned her neck to see what had caused the holdup. She turned back 
to me with a shrug. “So. We’re celebrating Mass this afternoon, and if you 
haven’t ever received God’s Light, it’s high time you did. I’ll teach you the 
dance after breakfast.”
“I thought you wanted me to play the music,” I said.
“You need to know the dance, too,” she said. “You should learn that first.” 
Lucia craned her neck again, then settled back into the line. “We don’t 
celebrate Mass as often as I’d like,” she said. “You need bread and wine, 
and as you might imagine these aren’t the easiest things to come by here.”
“How do you get them?”
“We have a few friends among the soldiers, and there’s always the black 
market... If you know so little about the Old Way, Eliana, do you know 
about the Journey of Gèsu, at least?”
“I recognize the name. Rachamin, Gèsu. Asaya, Gèsu.”
“Gèsu is the son of God, healer of the earth.” She sketched a cross. “When 
you say, B’sbem Arka, v’barah, v’nehora kadosha, that’s, ‘In the name of 
God, and Her son, and the Holy Light.’ Gèsu is Her son.”
I nodded, although this didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me.
“Gèsu was killed and His blood was spilled upon the sands. Where His 
blood fell, flowers bloomed, even though the land had been dead before. 
The Journeys say that we shall be redeemed through blood; the blood of

Gèsu will give new life to the land.” Despite her words earlier about how 
the Old Way wasn’t secret here, she had lowered her voice to a whisper. 
Habit, perhaps. “Each time we celebrate Mass, we help to bring that day 
closer.”
I nodded again.
“Before He left for the last time, He broke bread and shared wine with His 
disciples and said, ‘This bread is My body, and this wine is My blood. Eat, 
drink, and live forever; dance with Me and know the glory of God.’ So that 
is the Mass.”
I nodded again.
“I’ll teach you the dance after breakfast. It’s not hard.” Lucia peered 
around the line again. “Almost there,” she said.
We did finally make it to the front of the line for our gruel. Lucia led me 
through a maze of tents, bowl in hand, before finally sitting down in a tiny 
clearing, a miniature piazza formed by a gap in the tents. We sat down to 
eat. As soon as we were done, she put away the bowls and pulled me to my 
feet. “Right,” she said. “Time to learn the dance.”
I laid my violin aside and stood, feeling nervous. I had been dragged 
through those dances in Bosco, but I felt much more exposed in the bright 
daylight with just me and Lucia dancing. People started coming out of 
their tents to watch. “Don’t mind them,” Lucia said, which didn’t make me 
feel any better.
“What do I do?” I asked.
“It has a three-beat rhythm. One two three one two three one two three 
one two three. And the steps go like this: side hop step side hop step side 
hop step side hop step.” She showed me. “Now, slowly,” she said. “You try.”

I took a tentative step to my left, then hopped, then took another step. My 
feet got tangled up and I flushed. Our audience laughed, not unkindly, but 
I could feel my face flush hotter.
“It’s all right,” Lucia said. “Most of them can’t do it either. Come on. One 
two three.”
It took several repetitions to get the steps down. “During Mass, you hold 
hands with the people around you,” Lucia said. “I’ll teach you the song 
now, so you can play it next time.” She sang it for me; she had a very pure 
soprano voice that sounded almost like a violin. I took out my violin and 
played the song through several times; I was tempted to harmonize a bit 
with Lucia’s voice, but I was afraid that Lucia would disapprove of 
alterations to music that was sacred to her.
At around noon, she led me toward the edge of the camp, to the side of a 
hill guarded by a soldier. Ran joined us a bit later, along with a dozen 
other men and women. Rafi produced a chalice, filled it with water, then 
added a few drops of wine; someone else produced a small piece of bread 
and gave it to Lucia.
We joined hands in a circle around Lucia. She closed her eyes and started 
chanting in the Old Tongue. On some cue that I didn’t see, we started to 
dance, stepping in a circle to our left. “Arka, v’barah, v’nehora kadosha. 
Arka, v’barah, v’nehora kadosha.”
On another signal I missed, the dance stopped, and everyone around me 
knelt briefly to touch the ground. I caught up with them and crossed 
myself with everyone else. “B’shem Arka, v’barah, v’nehora kadosha,” 
Lucia said, and everyone said, “Amen.”

FIRES OF THE FAITHFUL - NAOMI KRITZER
I didn’t catch much of the ritual; it was all in the Old Tongue. Finally, 
Lucia raised the bread and the chalice to the sky. “Iyt gufay,” she said. “Iyt 
damay. Achal. Ashti. V’chaya ad alam-almaya.”
“Amen,” we said, and crossed ourselves.
Lucia took a sip from the chalice, then a bite of the bread. Then she 
stepped into the circle and crossed to face me. “Gufa d’go’el,” she said, and 
broke off a tiny piece of the bread. “Eat it,” she whispered when I 
hesitated. It was stale bread, terribly dry; I was thirsty from dancing in the 
noon sun, and was barely able to choke it down. “Dam d’go’el,” she said, 
and gave me a sip from the chalice. The wine was a faint aftertaste in the 
bitter wasteland water.
“Cross yourself,” she whispered, so I did.
She went around the rest of the circle. When she finished, the bread was 
gone, but there was still liquid in the chalice. “Dam d’go’el,” she said. “May 
the blood of the Redeemer bring life and purity to the earth that God 
created,” and poured the rest of the water onto the ground at the center of 
our circle.
We danced and chanted a bit more, then we each knelt to touch the ground 
and she spoke a few words of blessing. “Go, the Mass is ended,” she said.
“Thanks be to God,” said Rafi, next to me, and I muttered the words a 
heartbeat late, again.
The group dispersed quickly, Rafi lingering with Lucia and me.
“What did you think?” Lucia asked, and her eyes sparkled.
“I don’t know much of the Old Tongue,” I hedged.
“You’ll need to learn, sooner or later . . . but the Mass?”

“It was ...” Watching Lucia lead the Mass was like watching my priestly 
brother in church. “The music is beautiful.”
Her eyes showed no disappointment, so I must have said something close 
to what she wanted to hear. Rafi squeezed my shoulder again; he 
understood. “It will make more sense as you learn,” Rafi said. “I think you 
were meant for playing, not for dancing.”
“So,” Lucia said to Rafi. “Were we going to take Eliana to watch Giovanni 
at work?”
Rafi raised his eyebrows. “If you think it’s wise.” He turned to me. “Would 
you like to go watch Giovanni?”
Watch him do what? “I’d love to,” I said. There was no way I was letting 
Giovanni get away with thinking that he scared me. Not a chance.

blacksmith’s shop; I could see the remnants of the furnace. The two open 
sides were screened by a couple of taller tents. I couldn’t believe that 
Teleso didn’t know this was here, but maybe it served some purpose for 
him, like riots and Old Way rituals.
It was a cramped space to use for physical training. A half dozen skinny 
young men stood pressed against one of the walls, watching as Giovanni 
shouted at a seventh.
“Severo! You’re holding it wrong. It’s a sword, you turnip, not a hoe. No, 
not like that! How can you be so stupid?” Dropping his guard, Giovanni 
strode over and readjusted the boy’s grip on the wooden stick he held. “ 
Left hand here, right hand here. This isn’t that hard, you idiot. Now, 
defend yourself!” The boy swung the stick up, holding it clumsily at one 
end, trying to mimic Giovanni’s stance. Giovanni also wielded a wooden 
weapon, carved a little more artfully. “No! Not like that! Oh, you’re 
hopeless. Give it to Michel. Michel! It’s your turn.”
Severo returned to the wall with obvious relief, passing the stick to Michel.
“No!” Giovanni howled. “You just handed him the blade, you idiot! Michel, 
give it back to him. Severo! This is the hilt. That is the blade.”
“That’s a stick,” I said.
“You stay out of this,” Giovanni snapped without turning; he must have 
noticed us as soon as we came in.
I fell silent for a moment, then turned to Lucia. “What is he doing?”
“Training them to fight with a sword,” she said.
“Where are they going to get real swords?” I asked. Lucia shrugged. 
“Giovanni! Why are you training them on swords?”

“What business is it of yours?” he said, but Michel, grateful for any 
distraction, had dropped his guard and was waiting with interest for the 
answer. “What other weapon would I train them on? Crossbow?”
“You were a university student, weren’t you?” I said to Giovanni. Dueling 
was something of a gentleman’s art; conservatory students were warned 
about this in passing during the lectures on courtly etiquette. Young men 
from that class were tutored in fencing from an early age; even the 
physician at the conservatory had a sword, though he seldom carried it.
I stepped onto the training ground. Michel was about the same age as my 
eldest brother Agrippo had been when I left home. Agrippo was the 
brother who brawled over the girl and wound up with the cracked head. At 
least, he was the first of my brothers to brawl over a girl and wind up with 
a cracked head. I gave Michel a tentative smile and he smiled warmly back.
“Give me your ‘sword’ a moment, Giovanni,” I said.
“Get out of here!” he said. “What right do you have, coming in here like—”
I held out my hand stubbornly. He reversed his grip to pass me the “hilt” 
with a sullen glare. “Thank you,” I said. “Now Michel. You’re holding a 
stick. Let’s see if you know how to use it.” I slapped the “blade” into my 
opposite palm and swung the staff at Michel.
Giula and Bella and the other girls at the conservatory could probably not 
have done this, especially after five years of sheltered conservatory life. But 
I had grown up with seven brothers, and Donato had taught me to fight.
Michel grabbed his stick like a stick and deflected my swing effortlessly; 
his grin grew wider. “You swing a staff like a girl.”
“In your dreams, big brother,” I said, returning the grin. I hooked his staff 
with mine and nearly jerked it out of his hand. He swung the stick to knock

my wind out but I dodged aside.
“Lovely,” Giovanni said. “But the soldiers he’ll be fighting won’t be 
swinging sticks.”
“Fine, then,” I said, and handed the “sword” back to Giovanni, hilt first. 
“Michel, show Giovanni how you’d deal with a sword.”
Michel was still grinning; he dodged Giovanni’s first two thrusts, then 
hooked the sword and sent it flying. He swung the staff again, to clip 
Giovanni across the head. I had a feeling that Michel had put up with quite 
a few smacks on the head from Giovanni’s sword. Giovanni stumbled back 
a step and then snapped, “Hold.” He turned around to glare at Michel and 
the other six boys. “Out,” he ordered, and they left gladly, still grinning. He 
turned on me.
“I’ll thank you,” he said icily, “to stay out of the way during training 
exercises.”
“What are you trying to do?” I demanded. “They aren’t university students. 
They aren’t gentlemen. You’re trying to teach them to fight, aren’t you? 
Don’t you want them to win?”
“I suppose you think I should be teaching them to swing plows and 
pitchforks,” Giovanni said. “I’m teaching them to fight with real weapons.”
“A real weapon,” I said, “is the one you know how to use.” I turned to 
Lucia. “Let’s go, Lucia,” I said. “I think I’ve seen plenty.” Besides, I’d had 
the last word, and I wasn’t sure I could come up with another retort.
“Don’t come back here!” Giovanni shouted as we left. “Don’t you dare 
come back here!”
“You’re right,” Lucia said, once we were out of earshot. “Why make them

learn to fight with swords when they already know how to use another 
weapon?”
“Lucia,” I said. “Is Giovanni planning to train six boys at a time until the 
whole camp knows how to fight? We’ll be dead of old age before he’s half 
done.”
Lucia sighed. “Beneto and Jesca don’t have much faith in the arms training
—that’s why they put Giovanni in charge of it. Our real strength is our 
sheer numbers. There are thousands of refugees here, and only 122 
soldiers. If we decided to walk out tomorrow, they’d run out of crossbow 
bolts before they could kill all of us.”
“So why don’t we? I suppose they could kill a fair number of us.”
“Yes. And so many people have lost hope . . . Beneto thinks that our best 
chance is to wait until people are really angry, then try to direct their 
anger. We could tear the crossbows from the soldiers’ hands and use them 
against them, and only a handful of Ravenessi would die. We just have to 
get people angry enough.”
I shook my head. “I don’t know, Lucia.”
“Beneto’s convinced we could make it work. But we’d need an incident, 
first.”
“What about the massacres Rafi referred to? Those must have involved 
‘incidents.’ ”
“Yes. And yet here we are. Beneto thinks that next time, he can make it 
work.”
I shook my head. “I don’t know. I’m angry already. I bet other people here 
are, too. If he organized people— trained them properly—”

“So tell Beneto. Maybe he’ll listen to you.”
As the sun neared the horizon, Lucia and I got into the line for dinner. As 
we waited, I heard a voice rasp behind me. “Signora,” the voice said, and I 
felt someone tugging at my sleeve. “Signora!”
I turned and sucked in my breath. It was the madman from the road. 
“Welcome, signora,” he said, gravely.
Lucia turned. “Amedeo,” she greeted him. “Is this the one you spoke of?”
The madman looked offended. “Have there been any other musicians 
who’ve arrived this month?”
“No—”
“Then she’s her. Don’t be ridiculous.” He turned to me. “The tune of the 
piece is not going quite as you expected, is it?” I tried to stare him down, 
but he refused to look away, grinning at me broadly. “Don’t worry. We 
know what we’re doing.”
“Piss off,” I said, shakily.
He laughed. “Welcome, signora. Enjoy your stay in Cuore.” He wandered 
off down the line of people, weaving and stumbling like a drunk.
“So,” Lucia said. “That’s Amedeo.”
“I’ve met him before,” I said.
“He gets around. Like Rafi said, the Light is too bright... he’s cracked.”
“I don’t like him.”
“Well, he’s a nuisance,” she said. “It’s even worse that some of what he 
says is inspired. You actually have to pay attention to his ravings. And fret 
about them.”
The line inched up. We had barely moved, although more people had

joined the line behind us. “What did he mean, ‘enjoy your stay in Cuore’?”
Lucia shrugged. “Who knows? He might have meant that you’re going to 
go to Cuore sometime. Or maybe he meant that in some sense, this is 
Cuore. Or maybe he was just raving.” She shook her head. “You never 
know with Amedeo.”
“Lucia. Eliana.” We turned; this time it was Beneto and Jesca who’d come 
up behind us. “How did today go?” Beneto asked Lucia.
“Well, I think,” Lucia said.
Beneto took Lucia aside to confer with her in a low voice, and Jesca gave 
me a conspiratorial smile. “I heard about your confrontation with 
Giovanni.” Jesca squeezed my shoulder. “Good for you.”
“So what do you think?” I asked. “About training peasants in the weapons 
of the gentry?”
Jesca shook her head. “It doesn’t matter all that much. Our strength is in 
our numbers, if we could only ...” She shrugged. Her voice was crisp and 
chill, like a bell through evening mist. “Sooner or later, Teleso will make a 
mistake. When people are angry enough, they won’t need weapons. They’ll 
fight the soldiers with their bare hands, grab the crossbows away, and tear 
the keep to the ground. It will happen.”
I shivered.
Beneto was done with his conference with Lucia, and Beneto and Jesca 
moved off down the line. They spoke briefly with almost everyone, 
squeezing peoples’ hands or shoulders, offering commiseration and 
comfort. They reminded me of the priest and priestess back at the 
conservatory.

We took our gruel back to Rafi’s tent. Giovanni was there. I hadn’t seen 
him join the food line, but he’d gotten his gruel somewhere and beaten us 
back to the tent. He moved over to make room for us, but it was clear he 
wasn’t happy about it.
“So,” Ran said. “Did you have a nice day?” He sounded just like my 
mother, and I started laughing, then crying, and Giovanni stared at me like 
I had gone completely mad.
The next morning, Beneto took me aside after breakfast. “I heard what 
happened at the training ground yesterday.”
“Uh-huh?” I said.
“I’d appreciate it if, in the future, you left Giovanni to his own devices 
there. That’s his territory.”
I felt my face grow hot. “Jesca said—”
“Jesca is my lieutenant. I am the Generale here.”
“Ah,” I said, and looked down.
“Think of it this way,” Beneto said placatingly. “If you were conducting a 
musical ensemble, and Giovanni came up and started complaining about 
the way you were going about it, how would you feel?”
I looked up. Beneto was searching my face with his eyes. He really wanted 
to convince me that he was right, which was strange to me; if he was 
“Generale,” why did he care what I thought? “Beneto,” I said, “there are 
many different ways to conduct an orchestra. However, any conductor who 
started off by making the brass players take up violin would be replaced. 
By his superiors.”
“Ah,” Beneto said, and now he flushed. “Well, you know, this military

training—”
“Is just to keep Giovanni busy,” I finished. “Irrelevant in the larger scheme 
because once people get angry enough, they’ll break out by sheer force of 
numbers. Doesn’t it seem to you that more of us will survive this breakout 
if we’ve learned a bit about fighting together first?” Beneto wasn’t listening
—I could tell—and I grabbed his arm. “Everyone comes to the conservatory 
knowing how to play an instrument. And most of the men here—and quite 
a few of the women—know how to fight, even if it’s just brawling or 
fending off wolves with a bow. But just as conservatory students must 
learn how to play in an ensemble, the people here need to learn to fight as 
an army. Isn’t that what you want?”
Beneto extracted himself from my grip gently, the smile never leaving his 
face. “I’ll think about it,” he said. “For now, leave Giovanni alone. That’s an 
order.”
My jaw dropped as he walked away, and I ducked back into Rafi’s tent. 
Giovanni was long gone, but Lucia sat drinking some of Rafi’s “tea.” “I 
never signed on to your movement,” I said. “Why does Beneto think I take 
orders from him?”
Rafi glanced at Lucia. “Told you,” he said to her. He turned back to me. 
“Right then. I’ll tell you to stay out of Giovanni’s way when he’s training. 
You’ll do it because you sleep in my tent, and I want some peace under my 
roof, even if it’s a cloth one.” He gave me a menacing glare, but I could see 
the glint of amusement in his eyes.
“Yes, signore,” I said.
“You see?” He was speaking to Lucia again.
“Don’t tell me,” Lucia said. “I was on your side all along.”

I looked at Lucia. “Lucia, he—”
“We heard,” Lucia said. “Tent walls are thin. And you may be right, but 
give it some time. Beneto is a reasonable man, but you’ve only just joined 
us. Give it some time.”
Lucia took me for a walk later along the hillside around the entire camp. 
“This is as far as we can go,” she said. “Any farther, and they’d have to 
shoot us.” She indicated the soldiers who patrolled the edge of the hill.
“Do you know any of the soldiers?” I asked.
“Many of them. By name and reputation, at least. I can’t say I’ve ever 
exchanged many words with Niccolo.” Her lips tightened. “And I try to 
keep out of Teleso’s way.”
“Niccolo.” The name rang a bell. “I think I saw him. He was serving food, 
and caught a boy trying to steal the ration chits. The other soldier wanted 
to let him go, but—”
“Niccolo turned him in. I know. He’d have volunteered to flog the boy 
himself, if he’d been on duty then. Charming man, Niccolo.”
“Not all the soldiers are like that.”
“No.” She waved as we passed one soldier along the hill. He glanced 
around to see if anyone was watching and then trotted down the slope to 
greet us. “Most of them come from Verdia, just like the rest of the people 
here. They joined the army for the duration of the war, and most of them 
feel that they’ve been double-crossed . . . being sent down here instead of 
getting their bonus and being released from their oath to the Emperor. 
Nobody wants to be here. Even Niccolo.”
“Hey,” the soldier said, joining us. “You’ve settled in fast.” I realized it was

the soldier who’d brought me here—what was his name?
“Mario,” I said. “It’s nice to see you again.”
“Did you find your family?” he asked me.
“No.”
“I’m sorry.” He looked genuinely bereaved. There was an awkward pause.
“I heard you playing your violin for the Ravenessi the other afternoon,” 
Mario said. “I was wondering, could you come play in the barracks some 
evening? I can’t promise everyone would stay awake for you, but I would.”
“I’d be honored to play for you,” I said.
“Good. Tomorrow night? After sunset?”
I nodded. “Tomorrow night would be fine.”
“I’ll meet you in the piazza. You’ll need an escort to get into the barracks.”
Belatedly, I threw a glance at Lucia, worried that I’d just made a mistake, 
but she didn’t seem concerned. There was a threatening shout, and Mario 
jumped. “I need to get back to patrolling,” he said. “I’ll see you tomorrow 
night!”
We continued around Ravenna. I had seen Ravenna from the hillside 
before, but it had been quiet and almost calm in the twilight. In the bright 
light of midday, Ravenna crawled with activity like an anthill, even though 
few of the people could have had anywhere to go. The tents were a garish 
assortment of ragtag colors, muted by the accumulated dust; few of them 
were more than shoulder height at their tallest point. The keep stuck out 
jarringly, like a giant boulder in a burned-over prairie.
“In a way,” Lucia said, “the soldiers are prisoners here as much as we are, 
even if they’re fed better.” She gazed at the keep. “Except for Teleso. He

has friends in Cuore; he could go home if he liked, but he’s happy to play 
Emperor here in his own little capital.” She pushed her hair back behind 
one ear. “The Fedeli don’t come here because they fear what it means 
when they can’t use the Lady’s Gift; the Circle doesn’t come here because 
they fear their own powerlessness. And the rest of the world is happy 
enough to forget about us, which is just fine with Teleso.”
“Why are you here?” I asked. “Even if the Fedeli in Varena are after you, 
you must have other options. Is it because of Beneto and Jesca and their 
reform movement?”
Lucia shrugged. “Not really. Maybe a bit. I’m here because I think that God 
wants me to be here.”
“How did you get in trouble with the Fedeli?”
“Can’t you guess?” She grinned. “That’s not fair. I’m sorry. I’ll tell you 
sometime, I promise, but it’s a long story and right now I want to finish 
our walk. Are you really going to go play for the soldiers tomorrow night?”
“Is there a reason I shouldn’t?”
Lucia shook her head. “I try to steer clear of Teleso, and that’s not always 
easy in the barracks or the keep. But you should be fine with Mario looking 
after you. He’s a nice boy.”
As we were finishing our circle, Michel—the young man that Giovanni had 
been trying to train on sword—trotted up. “Eliana,” he said.
“Michel,” Lucia said. “You’re supposed to be in training.”
Michel shrugged and gave me a broad grin. “Yeah,” he said. “Might as well 
go rabbit hunting in the Ravenna piazza, for all the good it’ll do me.” He 
hooked his thumbs on his belt, an extremely worn brown sash. “I like

being told I can fight the way I’m used to. I wasn’t so bad at it, back 
before.”
“Yeah,” I said. “You were probably a brigand that preyed on travelers to 
Pluma, weren’t you?” I glared at him mildly and he gave me a grin back. 
“Where are you from?”
“Merela.” My expression must have been blank, because Michel shrugged. 
“It was a pretty small village.”
“Michel,” I said. “The key isn’t just learning to fight, it’s learning to fight 
together. Like the army already knows how to do.”
“Can you teach us that?” he asked.
“I’m a musician. You need somebody who knows fighting to teach you 
that.”
“You seemed to know something about fighting yesterday.”
“I know something about sticks,” I said. “And unlike certain people, I’m 
not completely devoid of common sense. But fighting like an army—” I 
spread my hands wide. “I might be able to teach you to play like an 
orchestra.”
Michel laughed. He had a nice laugh. “I’d still take you as an arms master 
over Giovanni.”
“Give me a couple of weeks,” I said, and he grinned again and hiked off 
back down the slope.
Later that afternoon, Lucia started teaching me her Old Way songs, 
beginning with a prayer for rain. It had a strong beat, like all the Old Way 
music I’d heard, and shifted between a sweet and a sad sound.
“Maybe I shouldn’t play this one,” I said. “I sure don’t want rain right

now.” Ravenna in the rain would turn from a bowl of dust and ashes to a 
sodden mud-laden heap. I didn’t even want to think about what winter 
must have been like here.
“Don’t worry about it,” Lucia said. “God knows we have to practice 
sometimes.”
I played the piece through, and Lucia showed me the dance steps, though 
she didn’t try to make me learn them. “You said you learned songs and 
some prayers at the conservatory,” she said. “Did you ever participate in a 
true ritual?”
I laid my violin aside gently. “No,” I said. “But my roommate, Mira, 
formed a group to play the songs together. One time another friend of 
mine, Bella, got word that her sister had died, and we played the funeral 
music. Bella went on to become Redentore. The Fedeli killed her.”
I’d expected more questions about Bella, but instead Lucia asked, “Who 
was Mira?”
I pulled away, startled. “Why do you want to know?”
Lucia looked at me steadily. “Something in your face when you mentioned 
her name.”
I shrugged and lowered my eyes. “My roommate. I told you.”
“All right, then.”
I wanted to change the subject. “How did Beneto and Jesca end up here? 
Did someone up in Cuore not like them?”
“Oh, no.” She shook her head. “Everyone likes Beneto and Jesca. For them, 
it was a choice between being third or fourth somewhere more 
comfortable, or being leaders here. They’re idealistic. They thought they

could make a difference.”
“Do they still?”
“I think they do, yes.”
I hugged my knees and rested my chin on my arms. “What do you mean by 
being third or fourth somewhere else? Like Giovanni is here?”
“More or less. There are cells, you see. Each place. Each cell has a leader, 
and that leader has a second, and there might be a third, and fourth, and 
so on. Here it stops with Giovanni. They have a general, Beneto; his 
second-in-command, Jesca; and their lieutenant, Giovanni.”
“What about you and Rafi?” I asked.
“You can’t command among the reformers unless you were a student at 
the university. Rafi was a farmer, and I was never a student. I’m in the 
right class, so if I made a fuss, they’d probably make me a fourth, under 
Giovanni. But I’m not that desperate to be an official leader.”
“Why would you need to go to the university for this?” I was astonished.
“It was university scholars who realized the connection between magery 
and the famine. When the Circle tried to stifle that knowledge, it was 
students who started the reform movement.” She glanced at me. “It’s 
much more complex than I’ve made it sound.” She sketched in the dust. 
“There are twenty different ‘armies’ that basically consist of a bunch of 
officers and whomever they can round up and convince to follow them. 
They all report to a centralized committee. Beneto and Jesca aren’t 
supposed to do anything other than recruit unless they get orders, or at 
least permission, from the high committee.”
“Lady’s tits,” I said. “They’ve organized the movement like the messenger

service.”
Lucia grinned. “In theory, anyway. In practice . . . well, like everyone else, 
the reformer leaders don’t like to come down here, and there’s no real 
good way to get messages back and forth. Sometimes Beneto sends 
Giovanni to sneak out and go to Pluma to send a message, but that’s risky 
and Giovanni’s not willing to do it that often. So in practice Beneto is 
pretty much on his own.”
I shook my head. “How many of these other armies have any actual 
followers?”
“Maybe a few.”
“And somehow, they’re going to overthrow the Circle?”
“That’s the idea,” Lucia said.
I stared at her for a long moment. “Giovanni’s not the only one of you 
who’s crazy. What do you think of all this?”
“I believe that God wants us to win, so we will.” She met my eyes and 
smiled slowly, and once again her eyes sparkled with light from within. 
“Somehow.”
Lucia and I lined up early for dinner; once we were done, I picked up my 
violin and went to the keep to meet Mario. The piazza was almost 
deserted. “We’re all still eating dinner,” Mario said as I walked up. “I’ve 
arranged some for you, too. Come on.”
The army barracks was a long narrow building next to Teleso’s keep. 
Inside, it was spare and crowded, just one long room lined with bunk beds. 
A narrow table ran the length of the room, and the soldiers sat on the 
benches, finishing their dinners. The room was brightly lit with torches,

and noisy with conversation. Mario made one of the soldiers scoot down 
the bench, clearing a spot for me on the end, and set down a bowl of soup 
and a slice of bread, the first bread I’d had since leaving the conservatory. 
“You can eat before you play for us.”
The soup smelled delicious, of meat and carrots and onions. I downed it in 
minutes, mopping up the last of the broth with the bread, and was left 
feeling vaguely guilty for not trying to find a way to take some home to 
Rafi and Lucia. “Done?” Mario asked. “Do you want any more?”
“I’m full,” I said. I was.
“Right, then,” he said, and stood up. “May I present,” he said, making a 
grand gesture, “Signora Eliana, Premier Concert Violinist of Ravenna.” 
Most of the soldiers applauded; some of the men sitting at the table moved 
over to their bunks and got comfortable to listen, pulling off their boots 
and flopping down. I spotted Niccolo on a bunk in the far corner; he 
watched me through half-lidded eyes.
I pulled one of the unoccupied benches over to the end of the room and 
hopped up on it, so that everyone would be able to see me. I started off 
with one of the folk songs I’d learned with Mira. Everyone recognized it, 
and joined in on the chorus. “Any requests?” I asked when I was done. 
Someone shouted out another folk tune, and I started off on that.
I played for hours, with Mario filling a glass of wine for me when I got 
thirsty. “Lights out is at midnight,” he said finally. “We should call it a 
night.”
“You’ll come play for us again, won’t you?” one of the younger soldiers 
asked.
“Yes,” I said, returning his smile. “The food’s better here.” I stepped down

off the bench and started to pack up my violin.
“Wait,” Mario said. “Aren’t you going to pass your hat?” I looked at him 
blankly. “They didn’t teach you that at the conservatory? I suppose they 
expected you to join an ensemble. When you entertain, you should pass 
your hat. Here, I’ll lend you mine.” He handed me his helmet, then 
pounded on the table to get the attention of the audience. “This is Eliana’s 
hat,” he announced, “and she’s passing it.” He took it back, fished 
something out of his pocket to drop in, and passed it along. When it had 
made the rounds, he deposited the contents into a cloth sack and handed it 
to me, reclaiming his helmet. “ Let me know the next time you want to 
come play,” he said as he escorted me out. “We’ll be waiting.”
I was fairly certain I knew the way back to Rafi’s tent, but all the same, I 
was relieved to see Lucia waiting for me in the piazza. “They passed a hat,” 
I said, holding up the sack.
“Let’s see,” she said. In the slight moonlight, I poked through. Several 
dozen ration chits. “Why do soldiers have ration chits?” I asked.
Lucia shrugged. “Ration chits here are as good as money,” she said. 
“People steal them, trade them, forge them . . . the soldiers are issued a few 
to use as bribes and rewards, when necessary. But, you know, there’s a 
black market. How do you think we got the wine for Mass?”
Two loaves of bread. A sachet of tea. A flask of wine.
I felt rich. “Let’s go home,” I said. “I want to show Rafi.”
Rafi met us at the entrance of the tent, in tears. “Thank God you weren’t 
here,” he said. “They’ve arrested Beneto and Jesca.”

CHAPTER TEN

Daughter, why do you seek me in darkness? I am
here, as I am everywhere, but why fight your way
through darkness when I will come to dance
with you in the light of the sunrise? 
 
—The Journey of Gèsu, chapter 8, verse 31. 
 
 
“Arrested?” Lucia sucked in her breath. “Why?”
“Disloyalty—conspiracy—everything.” Ran was visibly upset. “They came 
here. To my tent!”
“Did they take Giovanni, as well?”
“Don’t you think I would have told you that? No. Just Jesca and Beneto. 
Giovanni was here, but they didn’t seem to want him. But I’m afraid they’ll 
come back. Lucia, Eliana, you need to hide somewhere. Not here; this is 
where they’ll come back to look. Isabella’s tent—go there. Hurry! I’ve sent 
Giovanni into hiding as well. It’s best you don’t know where.”
“Here,” I said. “You should take this.” I thrust the sack at him. “There’s tea 
and ration chits. The soldiers passed the hat after I played.”
Rafi paused in his panic to take the sack and give me a hug. “You’re a good 
woman, Eliana. Now go!”

Lucia dragged me back through the sea of tents. “Arrested!” In the 
starlight I could see that her face was streaked with tears. “Arrested.” Her 
voice dropped and I couldn’t understand what she was saying; after a 
moment I realized that she was praying in the Old Tongue.
Isabella’s tent was on the opposite side of Ravenna from Rafi’s, and we had 
to go around the piazza rather than through it. “Isabella!” Lucia hissed, 
poking her hand in through the folds of the tent and waving. “Isabella, are 
you awake?”
“Yeah,” a voice muttered. “I’m always awake in the middle of the night.”
“Isabella, it’s Lucia and Eliana, and we need somewhere to stay!” There 
was a pause, and a rustle inside the tent. “Now!” Lucia hissed.
“Come in, then.”
We crawled into the tent. Isabella’s tent was made from sewn-together 
grain sacks; it was smaller and lower than Rafi’s, and very crowded. In 
addition to Isabella, there were four other people asleep in the tent 
already. They rolled out of the way and pulled the edges of their cloaks 
over their faces with half-asleep surliness. Isabella flipped her cloak back 
from her face and propped herself up on one elbow to light a candle. 
“What’s going on that you’re waking me up in the middle of the night?” 
Isabella was an older woman, perhaps my mother’s age; she wore her gray-
streaked hair in long braids. As she lit the candle, I noticed that she had 
broad peasant hands, tanned and callused, with the scattering of small 
scars that came from being careless with the kitchen knife.
“Beneto and Jesca have been arrested,” Lucia said. “We weren’t there. Rafi 
was afraid they’d come for us next.”
“If they want you, they’ll find you,” Isabella said. “You can’t hide for long

in Ravenna.” Lucia started crying again and Isabella patted her shoulder. 
“There, now. This means they aren’t interested in arresting you, doesn’t it?”
“But Beneto and Jesca—what will they do to them?”
“Get some sleep, Lucia. You too, Eliana. You’re up far too late for clear 
thought.” Isabella moved over to make room for us to lie down. I wrapped 
up in my cloak and squeezed in between Lucia and Isabella.
The tent emptied out quickly in the morning. Lucia and I each gave 
Isabella a ration chit, and she brought us back bowls of gruel. “You’re the 
musician, aren’t you?” she asked me. “I’ve heard you play. You’re good.”
“Thank you.”
“And don’t think I don’t know what I’m talking about, like the rest of your 
audience.” Isabella gestured toward the tent flap. “My own mother was 
quite a musician, though she never played in an ensemble. I can’t play a 
note, but I know what to listen for.”
“Did your mother go to a conservatory?” I asked.
“Never,” Isabella said. “Stayed at home her whole life. But she played 
beautifully. Taught all my children to play, too.”
“Did any of them go?”
Isabella shook her head again. “One of my daughters showed promise. But 
she died, during the war.” She sighed, and brushed some of the dust from 
her dress. “I should go see Ran. He’s probably more upset about the 
arrests than anyone, and with you two gone, he’s got no one to distract 
him. You stay here. Keep each other company. I’ll be back before 
sundown.” Isabella ducked out of the tent.
Lucia and I were left alone. I leaned back against my rolled-up cloak. “Is

Isabella a reformer?” I asked Lucia.
“Not exactly,” Lucia said with a flash of a smile. “She sympathizes, but she 
won’t take orders from Beneto. She kind of has her own faction of old-
guard troublemakers. Sometimes she comes by to tell Beneto that he’s just 
a child who doesn’t know what he’s doing. They’ve had some 
disagreements. We can trust her, though.”
“How long do you think we’ll have to stay here?” I asked.
“I don’t know,” Lucia said. “Giovanni got detained once, but it was just so 
Teleso could put a scare into him.” She lowered her eyes, looking worried 
again.
“Are you and Giovanni really cousins?” I asked. If I could change the 
subject, maybe Lucia would feel better.
“Yes.” She sighed. “Our fathers are brothers. And we’re both from Varena, 
even though Giovanni likes to style himself ‘of Cuore’ because that’s where 
he studied at the university.”
I didn’t understand this obsession that the university students had with 
being university students. Before Ravenna, I had met one person who’d 
been to the university: the physician at the conservatory. In lectures at the 
conservatory they’d explained that university scholars staffed the civil 
service, keeping things running smoothly so that the Circle could 
concentrate on keeping us safe and the Emperor could concentrate on 
ruling. Peasants didn’t go to the university; it cost too much and it just 
wasn’t done. Bright peasant children might go to the seminary; talented 
ones went to the conservatory.
“Is your father a government official?” I asked.
“No,” Lucia said. She rolled onto her side and held out her hand. “Give me

your sash for a moment.”
I untied the strip of red cloth and handed it to Lucia. She stroked the wool 
gently, then rubbed it against her fingers and checked for a stain. She 
closed her eyes and smelled it, breathing deeply. She folded the cloth 
tightly and creased it, then allowed it to unfold. “The wool is from Verdia,” 
she said. “The cloth is of average quality; the wool was probably spun in 
one cottage and woven in another. The red is quite a high-quality dye, 
imported from the East.” She gave me back the sash and winked. “That’s 
the sort of vastly useful information you learn as the daughter of a textiles 
merchant and importer.”
I gave her a skeptical look as I retied the sash. “You could have made all 
that up and I’d never know.”
Lucia smiled, tipping her head to look at me sideways. “You could show 
your sash to Giovanni. He ought to be able to tell you the same thing. It’s 
the family business— my father does the imports, his father does the sales.”
I took her hand, flipped it over. It was small and delicate, but deeply 
tanned and heavily callused. “You don’t look like a city girl.”
“Thank you.”
“What happened in Varena? You said it was a long story. We’ve got plenty 
of time.”
Lucia leaned back, resting against her own rolled-up cloak. “When I was 
fourteen, I decided I had a vocation; I wanted to become a priestess of the 
Lord and the Lady.”
“Why?”
“I felt ...” she gestured, then dropped her hands back into her lap. “I felt an

emptiness inside that wanted to be filled. I thought that the Church would 
fill it. I thought that was what a vocation meant.”
“How long did you stay at the seminary?”
“Three years.” She sighed heavily. “Three years of porridge and living in a 
bunk room with fifty other girls and owning no more than would fit into 
the pockets of my robe.”
“As opposed to now?”
A smile lit her face. “As opposed to now, when I have all I could ever 
need.” She looked at her tanned hands and her smile faded slowly to a 
wistful gaze. “The emptiness grew worse and worse, those three years. I 
thought if I believed enough, if I prayed and worked hard enough, I would 
feel the joy of the Lady and the peace of the Lord that my teachers spoke 
of. I used to—” her hands began to twist her skirt. “It got so that I rarely 
slept, but I could barely rouse myself from bed, even so. I felt like I was 
being walled inside a room with no door—” She took a deep breath, let it 
out again. “The end came when I spent four solid days and nights in vigil, 
praying in the chapel. It was this cold stone building, and I spent my vigil 
in this tiny room in the cellar, in almost complete darkness. Truth was, my 
teachers were tired of my sad eyes and bad attitude. They sent me down 
there and told me that if it turned out I didn’t have a vocation, I should 
just say so.”
Lucia’s eyes were closed now. “The first day and night I spent on my knees. 
The next I spent pacing. Oh, I was fasting, too—water but no food—so then 
the third day I was too weak to pace or to kneel. I lay in front of the altar 
and tried to pray. The fourth day I couldn’t even do that. I lay on the floor 
in the darkness, because I was also too weak to summon witchlight.”

“No one even came to see if you were all right?”
Lucia shook her head. “That wasn’t how it was done.” She paused and 
collected her thoughts for a moment. “While I was lying there, I felt a burst 
of light, like sunlight breaking through a cloud. I felt the darkness inside 
me recede, although the emptiness was still there. And I heard a voice say, 
‘Daughter, why do you seek me in darkness? I am here, as I am 
everywhere, but why fight your way through darkness when I will come to 
dance with you in the light of the sunrise?’ ”
“You weren’t dreaming?”
“No,” she said. “I wasn’t dreaming.” Lucia opened her eyes to meet mine. 
“I wasn’t dreaming. And I said to the voice, ‘Why do you leave me alone?’ 
And I heard, ‘You are never alone. But if you come into the light, I will 
dance with you.’
“So somehow I found the strength to stand up and stumble out of the 
chapel. It was dawn, the sun was rising, and no one was in sight. And when 
I came into the sunlight, it was as if my mind exploded into light. The 
emptiness was filled. And I knew this was what I had been seeking all my 
life. I shouted, ‘Dance with me, dance with me!’ There aren’t words to 
describe how this felt. But for the first time, God was truly with me.
“The ironic thing is, I thought it was the Lord and the Lady, finally 
showing up to tell me that I truly had a vocation. But when I shouted, the 
teachers came running and saw me dancing. I was singing this tune that 
came into my head—” she hummed a few notes, and I recognized the 
music from the Mass. “And they grabbed me and hustled me inside and 
started shouting that I had lost my mind, that only someone as twisted and 
evil as me would sing that inside a seminary of the Lady. I didn’t

understand what I’d done wrong at first, but finally I realized that I was 
singing an Old Way song and dancing the dance that goes with it. But the 
problem was, I wasn’t sorry.” Once again, a smile lit her face.
“So that’s why the Fedeli don’t like you?”
“Not quite,” she said. “The teachers finally decided it was the fact that I 
hadn’t eaten or slept in days that was causing me to be so obstinate. Up 
until then I’d always been this meek, sad girl, you see, and terribly eager to 
please. So they gave me something to eat and told me to go sleep for a bit. 
But instead, I went out to tell all the other initiates that we’d been looking 
for the wrong gods in the wrong places, and that if they’d follow me—I 
didn’t know the first thing about the Old Way at the time, of course—we’d 
find the true God and the true worship and dance together in the light. I’m 
sure I sounded as cracked as Amedeo.” She laughed, genuinely amused. 
“Fortunately, I had friends who warned me that the Fedeli were on their 
way, and so I left, barefoot, with nothing but my robe. It was early summer 
and I headed south. I remembered from classes on the spread of the Faith 
that Old Way superstition was most prevalent in the remote regions, 
particularly among peasants, so I headed to Verdia. And that’s why I can’t 
go back to Varena. They’d get me for apostasy and blasphemy and 
spreading evil doctrine. Back then the Fedeli weren’t going after the Old 
Way followers that much—mainly they were trying to root out heresy 
within the Church—but they made exceptions for crazed ex-seminarians 
who tried to recruit their classmates.”
“So how did you survive, barefoot and penniless?”
“Oh, I got by. People fed me here and there. Once I got to Cuore, I tracked 
down Giovanni and blackmailed him into giving me some money to go

away. He was horribly embarrassed by me. I used that to head deep into 
Verdia. That was about a year before the war started. I’ve been learning 
dances, and teaching them to others ever since.” She stretched, cracking 
her back. “So that’s what happened in Varena.”
“I can see how you got on the Fedeli’s bad side.”
“Yeah,” she said, and grinned. She was tremendously proud of her 
notoriety, I could tell. We sat in silence for a moment. “Your turn,” she 
said. “Why did you leave the conservatory?”
I shook out my cloak and rerolled it to make a better backrest, then leaned 
back again. “Well,” I said. “I was at the Verdiano Rural Conservatory, 
which is in Bascio.” Lucia nodded. “Last fall, a new student showed up ... 
Mira.” I told Lucia about Mira, and Bella and the Fedeli, and what Mira’s 
secret turned out to be.
“Why did she leave the Circle?” Lucia asked.
“She found out what had caused the famine,” I said.
“All the Circle knows what caused the famine,” Lucia said.
“And her grandmother died.”
“Ah.” Lucia looked at me speculatively.
“How secret is it that magefire caused the famine?” I asked. “I mean, I 
didn’t know until I heard Mira say it. But at the conservatory, we’re so 
isolated—”
Lucia sighed. “In Cuore, it’s something that everyone knows but nobody 
says, because to say it aloud is heresy, and the Fedeli are always listening.” 
She rubbed her forehead. “I told you it was discovered at the university? 
The Circle tried to cover up the knowledge by killing the ones who knew.

Fortunately, they missed a few. The survivors started the reform 
movement. This is part of why Giovanni is so suspicious. Some of his 
friends died in that purge.” She looked up again. “So, I’m sorry. I 
interrupted your story. The other mage came for her?”
I found my voice shaking as I told Lucia about waiting in my room as the 
light slowly faded, Mira standing in the doorway, Liemo forcing Mira to 
use magic to save me. “After that—” I clenched my fists; I still didn’t 
understand this. “Mira just seemed to collapse in on herself. She started 
crying, and she followed him downstairs. They got on horses, and they 
rode away.”
There was a long silence. “Don’t be too hard on your friend,” Lucia said 
softly.
“She saved me—how can I hold that against her? But I don’t understand 
why she just left like that. Just because she’d used magic once. She could 
have refused after that.”
“It’s not quite that simple,” Lucia said.
“What do you mean?” I asked.
“It’s difficult to explain.” She shook her head. “I’m not sure I entirely 
understand it. But it is very difficult for mages to stop doing magery. 
Imagine that you were dying of thirst, and someone offered you a cup of 
water. Even if you knew that the water was poisoned, you might drink it, 
because it would satisfy your thirst. And once you’d taken the first sip, it 
would be even harder to stop.” She looked into my face, searching for 
some sign of understanding. “As I said, I don’t entirely understand it, 
either. But don’t judge Mira too harshly.”
“I trusted the Circle, once,” I said.

“All of us did. Don’t judge yourself, either.” Lucia studied her hands. “I was 
in Verdia when the war broke out. Few people questioned the Circle’s story 
about the border raids that were leaving farm families dead.” Lucia sighed. 
“I didn’t even have to be a Redentore to know the real cause of the war—
just a merchant’s daughter who had seen where certain crops went after 
they left Verdia.”
I sat up straight. “What are you saying? What caused the war?”
“A great deal of trade comes through Varena. We buy and sell commodities 
from people across the sea—spices, dyes, certain drinks that are like very 
strong wine, fruits, and sweet things that no one down here has ever seen. 
Of course, we need things to sell to them in order to have the money to buy 
the goods they bring.”
“Of course,” I said.
“There’s a flower that grows—or used to grow—in the southern parts of 
Verdia and northern parts of Vesuvia. It smells very nice, and with some 
work can be distilled into perfume. A few years ago, demand for this 
perfume suddenly shot up—who knows why, a court fad on the other side 
of the sea, most likely—and merchants from Vesuvia were cutting into 
Varena’s profits. I’m sure they felt the same way about us. Both sides 
wanted the war; it was a gamble, but they hoped to destroy the other side’s 
ability to make the perfume.”
I felt sick, but not really surprised. “Are you saying that the Circle meant to 
drain the land?”
“Oh no,” Lucia said. “I think that was an accident—I think even the Circle 
didn’t realize that would happen. But certainly they meant to burn the

Vesuviani fields, to do what they could to keep the Vesuviani from growing 
those flowers.”
I shook my head and leaned back again. “I think right now you could tell 
me that they drained the land for the sheer joy of destruction, and I might 
believe you.”
“Don’t say that. They’re still people, even if what they do is wrong. Some of 
them even have family down here, like your friend, Mira.”
We were quiet for a while. Outside the tent, we could hear two old women 
arguing. They were arguing over a goat—someone had traded a goat for 
some chickens, but the goat died the next day. I looked at Lucia, baffled. 
The only evidence of goats in Ravenna was the meat in the soup at the 
barracks. Lucia grinned and shook her head. “I’ve heard these two at it 
before. That trade took place eight years ago.”
“Why would you fight over something like that here?”
Lucia shrugged. “Entertainment?”
“Do you ever feel like those women?” I asked, then flushed, realizing what 
an insulting question this could be. “With the movement and the Old Way, 
do you ever feel like there’s no real purpose in it? I mean—” I was in a hole, 
but I kept digging. “All my life I’ve trained to become a member of an 
orchestral ensemble. When I left the conservatory, I slammed that door 
shut. I still play and practice, but sometimes I feel like I’m just doing it 
because that’s what I’ve always done. Do you ever feel that way?”
I was afraid to look at Lucia’s face, afraid that she’d be furious at me, but 
she took my hand gently. “There are some things that are never 
meaningless. God’s love is one. Music is another.”
I finally looked up, but she wasn’t looking at me. “There is power in the

music of the Old Way and there is power in singing and dancing together—
power that can’t be stopped by the Fedeli, Teleso, or the Circle,” Lucia 
said. “One of the villages I went to had lost every dance but the one they 
called the Dance That Turned the Storm. This was a village in Marino, just 
on the coast of the sea. A fishing village. Years ago, a terrible storm was 
coming from the ocean, the kind that can destroy houses, and they had 
nowhere to go to hide from it. As the storm approached, the whole village 
went to the piazza and joined hands to dance. When they stopped dancing, 
the storm had turned and headed back out to sea. There is power in the 
dances. Even here.” Lucia looked up to meet my eyes. “That’s what you 
were getting ready for, all these years, Eliana. Even if you didn’t know it. 
Not to play in an ensemble. To play the Dance That Turned the Storm. 
Someday.”
Isabella returned to the tent in late afternoon. “Teleso has ordered the 
whole camp to the piazza at sundown.”
“How will everyone fit?” I asked.
“The tents on the edges of the piazza will be taken down until the assembly 
is over,” Isabella said.
“Does anyone know why?” Lucia asked.
Isabella shook her head. “No. But I heard that they’re building a scaffold.”
Lucia covered her face with her hands. “How is Rafi?” she asked after a 
moment.
Isabella sighed. “He blames himself. You know Rafi.” She patted Lucia’s 
shoulder. “Give me one of your ration chits and I’ll go get you some dinner. 
They’re serving it early so that we’ll be done by sundown.”
We each gave her a chit and she ducked back out.

When evening came, Isabella gave us each a scarf to partially obscure our 
faces as we headed for the piazza. “Stay near the back,” she warned us.
“Beneto and Jesca—”
“Will know that your thoughts are with them. It will be nearly dark. Even if 
you were in the front row, they wouldn’t be able to see you.”
Despite this warning, Lucia dragged me nearly to the front of the piazza; it 
wasn’t difficult, as most people seemed to prefer to be farther back. I 
tucked my violin case under my arm, trying to hide it with my cloak, since 
we didn’t want to be recognized. The violin made me pretty distinctive.
As we reached the front we got a clear view of the scaffold. Two nooses 
dangled, slack in the evening calm. “Oh no,” I heard Lucia murmur; her 
hand turned cold.
The setting sun lit the black hills to the west with an orange fire, but I 
don’t think anyone else noticed. As the colors began to fade, the front door 
to the keep opened. “Teleso,” Lucia said. “No one else uses that door.”
A squadron of a dozen guards marched out. I recognized some of the faces. 
Teleso was making his men work extra shifts. Behind the guards was a 
slender man with dark hair and cold eyes. I knew without asking that this 
was Teleso.
Escorted by the soldiers, Teleso strode up the steps onto the scaffold. He 
gestured for silence and a hush fell over the crowd. “People of Ravenna,” 
he said. He had a strong voice, as clear and deep as a church bell, and it 
rang through the valley on the still evening air. “You know that my first

willing to work. But to become part of our community, you must be willing 
to allow others to live in peace. Thieves will be punished. Marauders will 
be punished. And those who would destroy what we have built here will be 
cut off from our community.”
Teleso gestured to the soldiers who still stood in the doorway, and they 
came forward, dragging Beneto and Jesca with them. Beneto blinked in 
the torchlight, trying to see past the glare to our faces; Jesca looked dazed 
and sick. The soldiers dragged them up the steps to the scaffold.
“Beneto and Jesca,” Teleso said, “have committed extortion, treason, and 
disloyalty.”
Beneto stirred. “Lies!” he shouted. One of the soldiers standing beside him 
slapped him across the face; the sound echoed through the piazza. A rustle 
of fear and anger wound through the crowd.
“They have entered into a deliberate campaign of terror against the people 
of Ravenna,” Teleso continued. “This community has no place for them.” 
He looked slowly around the crowd, and for an instant, his eyes met mine. 
I felt like a field mouse in the shadow of a hawk. “The sentence is death,” 
he said. He stepped down from the scaffold, and the soldiers shoved 
Beneto and Jesca under the nooses. I realized that one of the soldiers on 
the scaffold was Mario; he averted his eyes as he held Beneto’s arms. 
Another soldier slipped a noose over Beneto’s head, tightened it around 
his neck. Next to him, I recognized Niccolo tightening the other noose 
around Jesca’s. Mario and most of the others stepped back.
Beneto closed his eyes and shouted, “For the glory of God, and Her son, 
and the Light!” Niccolo shoved him off the scaffold. The crowd went rigid; 
I could see people around me touching their collars, their throats,

watching Beneto’s desperate struggle for air. The soldiers had left his 
hands untied so that he could claw desperately at the noose, legs kicking 
frantically to find purchase. Lucia stood rigid, hands pressed against her 
lips.
Jesca cried out, “Death to the ones who have left us to starve.” Niccolo 
shoved her off the scaffold. Her face contorted as she tried uselessly to 
suck air past the noose, but through a supreme act of will, she clenched her 
arms at her sides, refusing to claw at the rope like Beneto. She would die 
with dignity. I touched my fist to my chest, then held it out, a soldier’s 
salute to his commander.
“Live with God, Jesca,” Lucia whispered. “Live with God, Beneto.” The 
woman on the other side of me turned away; others wept openly. As the 
last of the golden sunset faded in the hills, Beneto’s struggles finally 
ended; Jesca’s body became limp and still. Lucia’s hand found mine; she 
was as cold as ice, and so was I. People began to drift out of the courtyard. 
“Who will lead us now?” Lucia whispered.
“Come on, Lucia,” I said. As I started to help Lucia back toward the tents, I 
felt someone staring at me. I looked up to glare, and met Teleso’s cold 
eyes. I turned away hastily, but from the corner of my eye I could see him 
gesture to someone. As we tried to slip past the edge of the keep, a soldier 
blocked our path.
“Signora Eliana,” he said.
“Yes.” I looked up unwillingly.
“You’re to come with me,” he said.
“What?” Lucia cried.
“He’s not looking for you, Lucia,” the soldier said. “He just said to bring

him the violinist.” More kindly, he added, “It’s all right. I think he just 
wants to hear her play.” Glancing around, he gestured sharply to someone, 
and I saw Isabella coming over. “Take Lucia,” the soldier said to her. “I 
don’t think she’s in any shape to get home by herself. I’m to take Eliana to 
the keep.” Isabella looked at me for a moment, wide-eyed.
“I’ll be fine,” I said to Isabella, having no idea whether I was telling the 
truth or not. “Tell Lucia I’ll be fine.”
“Come on,” the soldier said to me, and he had a sword, so I followed him 
into the keep.

Teleso waited just inside the door of the keep. “Signora Eliana,” he said. 
“What a pleasure to meet you at last. I have heard a great deal about you.”
Forcing myself to meet his eyes, I drew myself straight and raised one

eyebrow silently.
“After your performance last night, half my soldiers were singing your 
praises. The rest were on duty at the time, and were thus denied the 
opportunity to hear you.” He gave me a smile that never reached his eyes. 
When he reached to touch my arm I jerked away without thinking.
“Don’t be afraid,” Teleso said. “I only want to converse with you, and to 
hear you play.” He held out his arm, crooked slightly at the elbow. “Take 
my arm, signora,” he said. I stood motionless for a moment. “Take my 
arm!” he said impatiently.
Awkwardly, I slipped my hand under his arm. The last time I had practiced 
this gesture was with Mira.
“Good,” Teleso said, tucking my arm snugly against his side. “Now, if you 
will join me for supper, I would appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate 
the advantages of friendship with me. Come.”
Teleso led me down the corridor and up a staircase, through a door into a 
room with a long table, and finally to a chair at the table. “Where are you 
from, Eliana?”
“Doratura,” I said. Teleso released my arm and pulled a chair out for me, 
slipping it neatly under me as I sat.
“If you’ll excuse me for just a moment,” he said, “I need to speak to my 
lieutenant about a few details. The servants will be in shortly with our 
meal.” He went out, closing the door behind him.
With Teleso gone, I took a deep breath and looked around. An iron circle 
of candles swung by a chain from the ceiling, lighting the room. There was 
a thick rug under my feet; I could feel the plush pile even through my 
boots. The table itself was long enough to seat twelve, but only two places

were set, one at each end.
The door opened and I jumped, but it was only a servant. He poured wine 
into a cup made of glass as thin as an eggshell, then set it by my hand. It 
looked as if it would shatter if I picked it up, so I decided not to; I didn’t 
want to spill wine on the tablecloth. The plate was also made of a thin, 
fragile-looking material. I tapped it gently with my fingernail; it made a 
tink noise like a bell. A knife and spoon were laid next to the plate, but 
there were two spoons and several items I had never seen before and had 
no idea what to do with.
The door opened again; this time it was Teleso. He sat at the other end of 
the table. The servant filled his wineglass, then left and returned a 
moment later with a platter of food.
“Serve the Lady first,” Teleso said as the servant approached him. He 
looked at me apologetically. “I wasn’t able to bring servants with me from 
Cuore, so I’ve had to make do. They’re all refugees, you understand—they 
work for me instead of building the wall—so we’re not even really up to the 
standards of Pluma.”
“Ah,” I said. I watched the servant as he cut a thin slice of meat and raised 
it over his head, then set it in the center of the table as an offering to Her.
“Now serve the guest,” Teleso said patiently when the servant started 
toward him again. Without looking up, the servant piled several slices of 
meat onto my plate, and suddenly I was ravenous. Ignoring the funny-
looking implements by my plate, I speared the meat with my knife and 
took a bite.
Teleso chewed methodically as he watched me dig in. Several times he

gestured to the servant to serve me more food. “You’re not drinking your 
wine,” he said as I mopped up the last of the juices with a piece of crusty 
bread.
“That cup it’s in,” I said. “I’m afraid I’ll break it.”
Teleso chuckled, not unkindly. “They’re sturdier than they look,” he said. 
“Just don’t drop it on the floor or throw it across the room.”
I picked it up carefully and took a sip of wine. The glass stayed in one 
piece. “From Cuore,” he said proudly. “Excellent vintage.” I nodded 
politely, although Doratura’s wine was better, or even Bascio’s.
The servant brought us tea when we were done, and Teleso leaned back in 
his chair to sip his, cupping his hands around the mug to warm them and 
looking at me thoughtfully. I met his eyes in a glare and he chuckled again, 
unoffended.
“So,” Teleso said, after a while. “I heard you came here voluntarily.”
“I was hoping to find that a member of my family had survived the 
destruction of my village,” I said. “None had.”
“How unfortunate,” he said, with what sounded like genuine regret. 
“Where did you learn to play the violin?”
“Originally, from a man in Doratura. Then I spent five years at the 
conservatory in Bascio.”
“Of course, the peasant conservatory,” he said. “No offense.”
“None taken,” I said. “Signore.” It was common knowledge that the 
peasant conservatories had higher standards than those that admitted the 
children of gentlemen for a fee.
“Call me Teleso,” he said expansively. “Are you any good? My men thought 
you were quite something, but they’re not exactly musical experts.”

“I like to think so,” I said.
“How old are you?”
“Sixteen.”
“Why did you leave the conservatory so close to finishing?”
I looked down and took another sip of tea, debating how to respond. I 
didn’t think I wanted to tell him the lie that I’d been caught with a boy; on 
the other hand, I wasn’t sure it was a good idea to share my opinions of the 
Circle.
“Come now,” Teleso said. “This can’t be such a difficult question. Surely 
you had your reasons.”
“I wanted to see my family,” I said.
“Homesickness? After all that time?”
I met Teleso’s eyes in a fierce glare. Teleso looked as though he were about 
to press the issue, but his gaze faltered and he dropped the subject.
“Let me see your violin,” he said. I picked up the violin from where I had 
set it next to my feet, and took the case down to his end of the table. Teleso 
set his tea down carefully, then pushed his chair back and set the case on 
his lap. He unfastened the largest buckle, then unlaced the leather thongs 
to open the case. “Lovely instrument,” he said. “Where was it made?”
“Mivera.”
“Of course,” he said. He took out the violin, stroked his hands along the 
smooth wood. “There is no instrument more lovely, is there?”
“No.” I had seen violins made with inlaid wood of different colors, or 
mother-of-pearl accents, but mine was very simple. Still, even the simplest

violin was beautiful to my eye, and mine was of a dark wood with a strong 
grain.
“Let me hear you play.” He offered me the violin and bow; I took them and 
went back to my end of the table, sitting back down to tighten the bow 
hairs and tune the violin.
“Any requests?” I asked, standing up again.
“Whatever you like,” he said.
I pushed my chair in with my foot and backed into a corner of the room, 
tucking the violin under my chin. Teleso seemed like someone who would 
be more impressed by virtuosity than singability, so I played one of the 
more technically impressive solos I’d learned at the conservatory. He 
applauded enthusiastically when I was done.
“Bravo,” he said. “Another.”
I played a long selection of pieces from my days at the conservatory; he 
clapped for each. “I have a request,” he said finally. “I don’t know what it’s 
called, but it has a catchy rhythm.” He tapped it out on the table. Da dat da 
da dat da wham wham wham. The Redentore funeral music.
I flinched slightly, pressing my back against the wall behind me. “I don’t 
know it, signore,” I said.
His cold eyes narrowed. “The Fedeli do not run Ravenna, Eliana. I do.”
I pulled myself up and gave him a long, measured look across the violin. 
He smiled slowly; this time, it almost reached his eyes. “My youngest sister 
went to a conservatory,” he said. “Our father paid the tuition; he thought 
having a musician in the family would give us a bit of culture. I know from 
her that all musicians learn the Old Way songs, sooner or later. So don’t 
tell me you don’t know this song.” He leaned forward across the table and

his eyes narrowed again. “You should want to stay on my good side,” he 
said gently. “And I want to hear you play this piece.”
I closed my eyes and picked a key, drawing my bow slowly across the first 
note. As I began the piece, I could almost hear the low rustle of feet on ash 
and rubble, remembering Amedeo dancing as I mourned my family. I held 
my tears in check tonight, and kept my feet still.
Teleso was silent for a long time when I finished. Then he poured himself a 
cup of wine and drained it. “Not bad,” he said. “You will stay as my guest 
in the keep tonight. The maidservant will show you to your room.”
She was a girl a year or so younger than me, dark-eyed and painfully thin. 
She avoided meeting my eyes as she led me up a winding staircase and 
through a heavy oak door. “Is this satisfactory, signora?” she asked as I 
caught my breath and looked around the room.
“Yes,” I said.
I surveyed the room slowly from the doorway. It was easily three times the 
size of my room at the conservatory. The floor was covered with deep rugs 
woven of a dark red wool. In the center of the room was a vast soft bed, 
piled high with pillows and quilts. A linen nightdress was laid neatly across 
the bed, along with a robe and slippers.
“Pull this cord—” the maidservant touched a silk rope by the door “—to 
summon me if you need anything. Do you require anything now?”
I shook my head.
“Good night, then.” She started to close the door.
“Wait—” I said. She froze, her hand still on the doorknob. “What’s your 
name?”

“Arianna,” she said. She looked up for a moment and I caught a flash of 
brown eyes and long lashes. “May I go now, signora?” I nodded and she 
closed the door.
I didn’t want to tread on the rugs with my boots on, so I leaned against the 
wall by the door and pulled them off, then padded across the floor in my 
stockings.
A few amenities were missing from the room. There was only a tiny slit of 
a window, high along one wall. There was also no way to bar the door. I 
wasn’t sure why I felt the need to shut the people in the keep out of my 
room, but suddenly this lack disturbed me intensely and I dragged one of 
the heavy chairs to the door and wedged it under the knob.
In the flickering candlelight, I caught a sudden glimpse of a strange man 
across the room, and nearly jumped out of my skin. The man jumped, as 
well, and I realized that I was looking at a mirror.
There were few mirrors at the conservatory, and the opportunity to see my 
reflection was rare. I had seen my reflection in water, of course, and in 
polished metal dishes, but I had never seen myself in men’s clothing. 
When I spotted the mirror, I went for a closer look, and decided that I 
really did look like myself—just different.
I was a mess. My hair was tangled and my face was thin and dirty. My 
clothes were dirty, too, although I liked the way the tunic looked on me, 
especially with the red sash. Much better than the conservatory robes. I 
didn’t think I looked that much like a boy, except for maybe all that dirt. 
There was a basin in the room, so I undressed and sponged off my body, 
then washed my hair. The soap was perfumed, a sweet, heavy scent. I 
didn’t like it, but it was an improvement over the dust and grime.
file:///C|/Downloads/Kritzer,%20Naomi%20-%20Eliana%...Eliana%2001]%20-%20Fires%20of%20the%20Faithful.html (261 of 400)08/02/2006 11:47:47

It took me a long time to comb out my hair. It had tangled badly in the 
wind and dust, and washing it had removed the dust but set the tangles 
into a sodden mess. It was just as well it was short; if I’d had to comb such 
tangles out of long hair, I probably would have lost all patience and cut it 
off with anything handy.
I was tempted by the linen nightdress, but decided after a few moments 
that wearing it would be accepting more of Teleso’s forced hospitality than 
I really wanted. I put my tunic and trousers back on, dirty though they 
were, then folded the nightdress neatly and laid it across a chair. I suppose 
if I’d really wanted to demonstrate my reluctance to accept Teleso’s 
hospitality, I would have slept on the floor instead of in the bed, but there 
was no point in being a damn fool about it. I crawled under the covers and 
was asleep almost instantly.
I slept heavily; when I woke, for a moment, I didn’t know where I was, and 
I thought wildly that I was back at the conservatory, since it had been so 
long since I’d slept in a proper bed. This bed was much too soft, though, 
and after a moment, I remembered where I was. I got up and made up the 
bed, then dragged the chair away from the door. I was tuning my violin to 
practice when Arianna arrived with my breakfast—a bowl of porridge, 
sweetened with honey, and a mug of tea. I sat down and ate everything 
she’d brought, scraping the sides of the bowl with my spoon to get the last 
remnants, although if I’d pulled on the cord by the door and asked, she 
probably would have brought me another bowl.
Setting the bowl aside, I looked up at the window, high on the wall. It was 
over my head, so I pulled the chair over to the window and stood up to 
peer out. I could see down into the piazza, and to the tents beyond. The

scaffold was still standing. The tents that had been taken down for the 
execution last night were back up, but the piazza was empty. No one 
wanted to set foot there. I climbed off the chair and pushed it back to 
where it had been.
I took my violin and went back to the mirror, checking my posture in the 
reflection. I closed my eyes as I played a set of scales, trying to imagine 
myself back in a practice room at the conservatory. Even with my eyes 
closed, the sound was strange, muted and gentled by the rugs and 
tapestries. This room was kept scrupulously clean; instead of dust, I could 
smell the lingering scent of tea and porridge. But when the breeze came 
into the room, it carried the sour smell of rot, like decaying corpses. I 
shuddered.
There was a knock at the door and I opened it. It was Arianna. “Excuse 
me,” she said, flinching.
“Come in,” I said, backing away from the door. “What is it?”
Arianna carried a colorful bundle in her arms. “Dresses,” she said, holding 
them out toward me. “Signore Teleso sent them for you. You can pick out 
whichever one you like.” I didn’t make any move to take them, so she laid 
them on the bed, shaking each one out and smoothing the fabric.
“I want to keep the clothes I have,” I said.
“He said for you to wear what you like,” she said.
“Good.”
Arianna brushed out the last dress, then looked up at me hesitantly. “You 
have not been in Ravenna long, Signora Eliana?”
“No.”

“Be careful,” she said. “Your life will be easier if you don’t make him 
angry.” Arianna looked back down at the dresses. “These are nice dresses. 
They would look lovely on you.” I didn’t respond, and she excused herself, 
closing the door behind her.
I went back to practicing.
Teleso swung the door open without knocking. “Good morning,” he said 
amiably, and closed the door behind him.
“Hello,” I said, lowering my bow but not my violin.
Teleso looked me up and down, then glanced at the bed. “Were none of the 
dresses satisfactory to you?”
“I like these clothes,” I said.
Teleso walked over to the bed, held up one of the dresses. It was a wine-
red velvet. “How about this one?” he asked.
“I like these clothes,” I said again.
“At least let the servants wash them.” He ambled back over to stand in 
front of me. “You can wear one of these in the meantime.” He laid the 
dress across my hands.
I stroked the fabric as I held it up against myself. It was almost as soft as 
cat’s fur. “It’s made for a smaller woman,” I said with a relieved smile. 
“There’s no way this would fit me.”
Teleso scowled and took the dress back. “We’ll see if we can find 
something your size.”
“I’m very tall,” I said. “For a woman.”
“Indeed.” Teleso looked me up and down again, slowly, then abruptly 
ordered, “Sit.” He gestured toward the chair.

I sat. Teleso remained standing, pacing over to the bed to toss the dress 
down.
“You’re likely to be here for a while,” he said, “so please understand that 
this advice is for your own good.” He glanced back at me. “That girl, Lucia. 
She’s trouble, she’s in trouble, and she’s likely to get in worse trouble. 
Steer clear of her.” He glanced at me again. I tried to keep my face bland, 
but I could feel a flush rising to my cheeks and I knew I was glaring at him. 
“There is one person here who can make your life significantly easier, and 
that’s me. You should want to stay on my good side.”
“Am I on your good side now?” I asked.
“Of course,” Teleso said. He picked the dresses up from the bed, shook 
them out, and draped them across his arm. “I’ll see about finding 
something that might fit you better,” he said, and went back out.
Arianna returned sometime later with a new set of dresses. “These are 
larger,” she said, unfolding one and holding it up.
“It’s still too small,” I said. It was velvet, like the other, but midnight blue, 
with gold brocade along the neckline and sleeves. What would it feel like to 
wear cloth like that?
“It will do, signora,” she urged, biting her lip. Her eyes were wide and 
alarmed, and that, more than anything else, persuaded me to comply.
“I’m not letting you wash my clothes,” I said. “I’m keeping them here.”
“Of course, signora,” she said, her face flushing with relief. I took the dress 
and waited for her to leave, but she just stood there. When I looked at her 
questioningly, she bit her lip again and said, “I’m to help you dress.”
I hadn’t been helped to dress since the last time I’d had a bad fever, almost

three years ago, and I felt terribly self-conscious. Arianna averted her eyes 
as I slipped off my tunic and trousers, folding them neatly and laying them 
on the bed. They could use a washing, but I didn’t trust her to give them 
back. “Here,” she said, and I realized that the dress buttoned up the back; I 
would need her help, after all. I shrugged on the sleeves and she buttoned 
it up. It took a long time. “I’ll comb your hair,” she said when it was done.
“I can do it myself,” I protested, but she sat me firmly down in the chair 
and undid my hair clasp. Arianna combed it out carefully, much more 
thoroughly than I had the night before, then braided it, winding a ribbon 
and a strand of blue glass beads through the braid. “This is ridiculous,” I 
said, squirming as the comb caught in a tangle. “You’re pasting peacock 
feathers on a sparrow. I don’t wear clothing like this.”
“You look lovely, though,” she said, and led me to the mirror.
If seeing a strange man in the mirror had been a shock, this was even more 
disturbing. The dress was cut low in the front, showing the tops of my 
breasts, and the fabric hugged my waist, stretching over my hips to flare in 
a long, full skirt. I had the body of a woman, which was something of a 
surprise to me. I ran my hands slowly over the fabric. I was disappointed; 
it wasn’t nearly as soft inside as out, and the brocade was scratchy. In the 
mirror, my face was pale and nervous. “I look like a child in borrowed 
clothes.”
“No,” Axianna said. “You look like a beautiful woman.”
I snickered at that, and my reflection looked slightly less nervous. I drew 
myself up straight. “Well,” I said.
In the mirror, I saw the door swing open behind me. “Much better,” Teleso 
murmured, and gestured to Arianna. She bowed and slipped out silently. I

continued to stare into the mirror, unwilling to turn to face Teleso.
He beamed at me over my shoulder. “Beautiful,” he said, and I blushed 
like a twelve-year-old.
“No,” I muttered.
“Yes,” he said, and stepped up behind me, resting his hand lightly on the 
small of my back.
“What time is it?” I asked, whirling abruptly to walk back to the hearth and 
pick up my violin.
“Just before noon,” Teleso said.
“I need to practice,” I said.
“You sounded fine to me yesterday.”
“Maybe,” I said, “but if I don’t practice every day, my skills will deteriorate. 
I don’t just practice to get better at playing, I practice to keep from 
backsliding, getting worse. Your sister must have told you that.” I knew 
that I was babbling, but tried to straighten my shoulders and meet Teleso’s 
eyes, though it was harder to do that in this dress.
Teleso did not follow me, although he watched me, a slight smile on his 
face. I backed into the wall with a thump. He still hadn’t moved.
“Eliana,” he said. “Relax.”
“What do you want from me?” I asked. My voice sounded high and thin, 
like a violin string about to break.
“Your company at the midday meal,” he said. “Nothing more. Was there 
something else you were expecting?” I gulped and I knew that my eyes 
showed fear. He smiled, and his cold eyes creased. “So if you will return 
from the corner, and take my arm, I will escort you to my study, where we

will have a nice meal, and good wine, and pleasant conversation.”
“Yes,” I said. “Thank you.” I took his arm, and he tucked my hand snugly 
against his side. He led me back down the stairs, through a series of 
corridors and finally into his study.
The meal was silent and uncomfortable. Teleso sat behind a massive 
carved desk, staring at me for most of the meal. I sat on the other side, my 
bowl on the very edge of the desk. I stared at my food to avoid looking at 
Teleso, eating quickly to get through the meal as soon as I could. The dress 
made me feel exposed.
There was a sharp rap at the door as I was finishing the last of my bread. It 
was one of Teleso’s officers, a dark-haired man with a face like a weasel. 
Teleso stepped over to the door for a hasty quiet conference. “Duty calls,” 
he said, returning to the desk. “I’ll have the maid show you to your room.” 
He rang for Arianna.
Alone in my room again, I alternated between practicing and pacing. 
Struck by a sudden worry, I checked the bed, but my tunic and trousers 
were where I’d left them. They really were filthy. There was a basin of 
water in the room, along with a bar of perfumed soap, so I decided to wash 
them. The midnight blue velvet was not exactly suited to washerwoman’s 
work, but wearing it hadn’t been my idea. Still, I rolled up my sleeves and 
worked carefully so as not to splash water on myself. It was awkward and 
slow, but I managed to get out the worst of the dirt. I wrung out most of 
the water, but needed to leave them to dry somewhere that Teleso 
wouldn’t see them and order them removed. I checked under the bed—no 
dust. Arianna was a thorough housekeeper. Hiking the velvet over my 
knees to avoid crushing it, I spread the belt, tunic, and trousers under the

bed to dry.
I was arranging the trousers when there was a knock at the door. I jumped, 
knocking my head on the underside of the bed before managing to crawl 
out, gritting my teeth and rubbing the back of my head. “Come in,” I said, 
trying to smooth out the dress with my other hand.
I was expecting Arianna, but it was a soldier, wearing a cloak with the 
hood pulled up to half cover his face. He closed the door gently behind him 
and flipped back the hood. It was Mario.
“Hello,” I said, startled.
“I have a message for you,” Mario said in a low voice, and held out a folded 
slip of paper. I hesitated. “Take it!” he said. “I can’t stay here. It’s from 
Lucia.”
Still rubbing my head where I’d bumped it, I took the note, staring at him. 
“Are you all right?” he asked, lingering a moment longer.
I shrugged. “The food is better and the bed is softer. But—” I shook my 
head.
Mario gave me a crooked smile. “It will all be all right.” He slipped the 
door open a crack and poked his head out to look for anyone coming. He 
gave me one more reassuring smile and left, closing the door behind him.
Alone in the room again, I sat down on the bed to read my letter. It was 
just a tiny piece of parchment, folded neatly. Lucia had drawn an X at the 
top. The letter was written in a beautiful, graceful script, but with the 
flourishes cut short. Eliana, the letter read. You must persuade Teleso to 
allow us to hold a funeral, and to allow you to play. This is our chance. 
This is what Beneto was waiting for. I have faith in you. By the grace of 
God, Lucia. In smaller letters at the bottom: Burn this when read.

I held the note a moment longer, as if by pressing it I would somehow feel 
Lucia touching my hand. Then I burned it to ash in one of the candles, and 
washed my hands in the basin.
The room was big enough for me to pace. What was going on outside these 
walls? I wished Lucia had sent me a longer letter. Was Ran doing better? 
She hadn’t said. I shook my head, wondering how I ever spent all those 
years at the conservatory. I’d only been shut up in here for a day and I was 
going mad, not knowing what was happening outside the walls.
I pulled over a chair and climbed up to look out the window again. At the 
very edge of the piazza, I saw Lucia. She stood quietly, her hands clasped, 
looking at the keep. Looking for me—I was sure of that, but there was no 
way she could see me through my tiny window, not from that distance. I 
tucked my violin under my chin and played for her, hoping that the notes 
would carry. Lucia remained where she was, silently keeping her vigil.
Who will lead us now? Lucia’s question from last night rang in my ears. 
After staring across the piazza at Lucia for a long time, I climbed down off 
the chair. Giovanni was next in line to lead, I realized, and shuddered. God 
help us all. I tried to concentrate on some etudes, but my mind kept 
wandering. Lucia would be a far better leader than Giovanni, but I knew 
that she wouldn’t do it—she believed that her calling was elsewhere. 
Isabella, perhaps? Rafi? None of them would be able to claim the popular 
support that Beneto and Jesca had built up, I knew that much. Especially 
not Giovanni.
Ravenna was in deep shadow when Teleso swung my door open. “Good 
evening,” he said with a smile. “Would you care to join me downstairs for 
supper?” He offered me his arm, then led me back down to the dining

room.
The meal was more hectic tonight. The weasel-faced officer I’d seen before 
was in and out throughout the meal. Teleso spoke to him quietly, glancing 
at me a few times to see if I was listening. I lowered my eyes to my plate 
and tried to look uninterested, tipping my head slightly to hear as much as 
I could.
“—could be a good chance. They’re all angry. Men couldn’t object—”
“Yes, signore. As you say—”
“It’s well past time.”
“As you say, signore.”
Teleso’s deputy left, and Teleso gestured to the servant to refill his 
wineglass. “Troublemakers,” he said to me. “All of them.”
I took a sip of my wine. “The refugees?” I asked.
“And the soldiers,” Teleso said. He drained his wineglass. “Lucia is 
demanding to be allowed to hold a funeral, with everyone in Ravenna 
attending.” He gestured to the servant, then jerked the wine bottle away 
and filled his own glass, banging the bottle down to the table. “I’ll have to 
deal with her.”
“A funeral—” I started to say. How was I supposed to persuade him to hold 
one?
“—Isn’t a bad idea, really,” Teleso said. “Make the refugees happy. What 
will they have to complain about then? You’ll play the funeral dance for 
them, of course.” He drained his glass.
“Yes, signore,” I said. That was easier than I’d expected.
Teleso filled his glass again. “The trouble is,” he said, “the bastards won’t

shoot unless there’s trouble.”
“Who won’t shoot?” I asked.
“Bastards downstairs who call themselves soldiers. I’ll have you play for 
them too.”
“All right,” I said. “Now?”
“No, not now!” he snarled. “Don’t be ridiculous. You’re supposed to play 
for me now. So stop talking. Did you bring your violin?”
“Not to supper,” I said. “It’s still up in my room.”
“Well, go get it,” he said. “Bring it to my study. I’ll wait for you there.” He 
rang for Arianna and rose, stumbling slightly. Arianna escorted me 
upstairs to get my violin, but when I brought it back down to Teleso’s 
study he was snoring in his chair.
I edged over to his desk, treading softly on the rug. His eyes were shut, and 
he was drooling slightly in his sleep. I reached out one hand to shake him, 
then thought the better of it. As I was pulling my hand away, I noticed the 
papers on his desk. Teleso had pulled some papers out to work on while 
waiting for me. I glanced at him again, but he was still drooling, his eyes 
closed. I hesitated for a moment, afraid he’d wake suddenly. He seemed 
pretty drunk, though. I picked up the papers.
The top paper was difficult to decipher; it seemed to be a page from a 
ledger, with calculations scribbled down the side. I realized after studying 
it for a moment that it was a reckoning of how much grain Ravenna had 
left, and how much this allowed per person until the next shipment. I 
could barely make out the numbers, but I could tell there wasn’t much 
grain to go around. I slipped the paper back onto his desk and went onto

the next one.
It was a letter from his superiors in Cuore. In receipt of your letter . . . 
Regret to say that supplements will be impossible at this time. 
Supplementary food? No, reading further, they meant supplementary 
soldiers. Advise you to make the most of the men currently under your 
command. The letter became steadily more patronizing. At the bottom, in 
the cramped handwriting of the ledger scrawl, was the single word, 
bastards. Teleso’s frustrations, most likely.
The final page was a list: Beneto. Jesca. Lucia. Isabella. Rafi. Michel. 
Giovanni. Mario. There were other names on the list, people I didn’t 
know. Tomas. Regillo. Petro. There was a small check mark next to Beneto 
and Jesca’s names. Lucia’s name was circled.
Teleso snorted loudly and I shoved the papers back and reached across the 
desk as he opened his eyes. “Signore?” I said, touching his arm. “Are you 
sure you want me to play for you? I think you need sleep more than music 
right now.”
“Surely,” he said. His eyes were bleary as he stood up and rang for the 
servant. “You’re right. Good night, then.” I gathered up my violin and 
headed for the door.
“Eliana,” Teleso said, and I froze in my tracks. “Tomorrow night. We’ll 
hold the funeral. You’ll play.” Arianna appeared in the doorway, and 
Teleso waved me off. “Sleep well,” he said.
Arianna had to help me undress for bed. She was less shy in the flickering 
candlelight as she unwound the beads from my hair and unbuttoned the 
long row of buttons down the back of the dress. “This dress is ridiculous,” I 
said.

“It’s a lovely dress,” she said.
“It’s a ridiculous dress. I can’t do anything in it.” I craned my neck to look 
over my shoulder at Arianna.
“You managed,” she said, glancing significantly toward my still-damp 
laundry hidden under the bed.
“This dress is making me miss those stupid robes we had to wear at the 
conservatory,” I said. “Those sleeves just got in the way. These don’t want 
to let me move.” I paused, but she didn’t answer. “Are you almost done?”
“Yes, signora.” She helped me step out of the dress, then hung it up neatly 
as I pulled the linen nightdress over my head.
“I can put this on by myself,” I said, when she turned to look at me.
“Yes, signora,” she said, but didn’t leave.
I straightened the nightdress as she stood looking at me. Finally I asked, 
“Is there something you need?”
“Would you play your violin for me?” she asked, then bit her lip and looked 
down. “I haven’t gotten to hear you play.”
“Oh!” I blinked in surprise. “Of course.”
“I’m sorry to ask you so late at night. During the day, I’m busy all the time, 
so I never get to sit and listen. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked.”
I took her by the shoulders. “Arianna. Sit down. I’ll play for you.” I pushed 
her gently into the chair she’d sat me in earlier, to braid my hair, then took 
out my violin and tuned up. “Any requests?”
“Something old,” she whispered, so I nodded and played the Redentore 
healing music. She didn’t dance, but closed her eyes to listen, rocking back 
and forth with the music. The minor notes echoed off the stone hearth; the

sweet chords were swallowed by the tapestries on the walls. I closed my 
eyes, hearing something I didn’t quite recognize in my own playing, just a 
faint echo, like the lingering taste of honey.
When I finished, Arianna sat with her eyes closed for a bit longer, and for a 
moment I thought she’d fallen asleep. “Thank you,” she said, her eyes still 
closed. “Good night.” She left without another word. I realized suddenly 
how tired I was. I put my violin away, then curled up under the covers of 
the bed. The room seemed quieter tonight than it had last night. I slept 
soundly, except for the sense that I needed Mira, or Giula, or Lucia 
sleeping near my side.
Arianna arrived the next morning just as I was getting up. She had a tray 
with porridge—a larger bowl than yesterday—and tea. While I ate, she 
brought in hot water for me to wash myself, along with a soft robe to put 
on when I had finished. “I’ll come back to help you dress,” she said.
“Not the damn dress again,” I said, but she was gone.
I finished my tea and porridge, and considered resisting. Arianna couldn’t 
physically force me to put the dress on; she was smaller than I was, and 
anyway it would ruin the dress. Then I thought about her fear yesterday 
and wondered if Teleso would punish her for my rebellion, if I refused to 
put it on. I checked under the bed; my clothes were still there, but damp, 
since they weren’t hanging up. I turned them over to give the damp side 
more air, then shrugged and stood up. I had washed myself some 
yesterday, but she’d brought enough water for me to wash much more 
thoroughly, and sleeping on white linen sheets had made me realize how 
dirty I still was. Besides, steam rose invitingly from the basin. I washed my 
hands and face, then pulled my nightdress over my head to wash the rest

of my body.
The door banged open and I whirled, snatching up the robe to hold it in 
front of myself. Teleso stood in the doorway, smiling slyly. “Go away!” I 
said.
Instead, he closed the door behind him. “Good morning, Eliana,” he said. 
Unfortunately, he did not look hung over at all.
Since I’d have to expose myself to put the robe on properly, I slipped it on 
backward, then tied it in the back. “Go away,” I said again. “I’m still getting 
dressed.”
“I can see that,” he said. He advanced on me, and I backed away. “You 
know,” he said, “the Redentori have the most curious customs. They 
believe that a girl shouldn’t lie with a man until they’re married. Now, how 
do they know if the Lady approves of their marriages? But you aren’t 
Redentore, are you? You just like the music.”
“Yes I am,” I said. “I’ve been sealed. I’m one of them.”
“But you haven’t been for long,” he said. “Their customs are not yours.”
“I have been at the conservatory,” I said. “I wasn’t even allowed to talk to 
boys, Lady’s blessing or not, not even at Midsummer.”
Teleso had backed me into a corner. “Eliana, I could make your life here a 
great deal easier,” he breathed.
“No, thank you,” I said.
“You should want to be my friend.”
“I’m not sure I like the price of your friendship,” I said. Teleso might not 
look hung over, but he smelled it; his breath reeked of stale wine.
He was about to reply when the door flew open. “You rang, signore?”

Arianna said from the doorway.
“No,” he snapped, but she came in anyway.
“Lovely morning, isn’t it?” I hadn’t previously seen Arianna quite so 
relentlessly cheerful. She started making up my bed, apparently oblivious 
to the fact that Teleso still had me trapped in the corner. “Signore Teleso, 
Lieutenant Romolo says he needs to see you.”
“Thank you, Arianna,” he said. “Tell him I’ll be right down.” She hesitated 
and he turned to glare at her. “Go and tell him I’m coming.”
It was clearly a dismissal, and she backed slowly out of the room. I tried to 
pull farther back into the corner as he turned slowly around to face me 
again, but he said only, “Think it over.” He straightened, turned around, 
and left.
I still wanted to wash, but I was afraid he’d come barging into the room 
again. I shoved a chair over to block the door and did my best to wash 
without ever taking off the robe. My face was hot, and it wasn’t from the 
water. When I was done, I pulled the nightdress and robe back on and tied 
them securely before I moved the chair away from the door.
Arianna was back shortly after that, biting her lip and avoiding my eyes. 
My hands shook as she buttoned me into the dress. “I don’t want to wear 
this,” I said, but she didn’t answer.
She sat me down when she was done buttoning me up, and braided my 
hair. “Arianna,” I said, “what does he want from me?”
“I don’t know,” she said.
“Have other women stayed here?”
“One other.”

“What happened to her?”
“He tired of her company.”
“And?”
“And she returned to Ravenna,” Arianna said, but I shook my head, not 
sure I believed her. “Hold still,” she said. “I’m almost done.”
“Do you know Mario?” I asked.
Arianna paused for a moment. “Yes,” she said. “I’ve met him.” Her manner 
was guarded, but she couldn’t quite hide the softness that came into her 
voice when she spoke about the kind soldier. I sat back, satisfied to have 
gotten that much out of her. Arianna finished tying the ends of my braids, 
and came around front to inspect the results. “Teleso wants you to join 
him for dinner again,” she said. “He’ll be here soon.”
“At least I’m dressed now,” I said, and she nodded, still not meeting my 
eyes.
Dinner was quiet. I sipped wine from the fragile-looking glass and nibbled. 
I didn’t have much of an appetite today. Weasel-face didn’t come in. 
Teleso dismissed the servants as we finished the meal. “So,” he said. “How 
have you been enjoying my hospitality?”
“You have been very generous,” I said.
“Is the food to your liking?”
“Yes.”
“And your room?” he asked.
“Very grand,” I said. “Much grander than I’m used to.”
“Do you like the dress?” He gestured with his wineglass. He was drinking 
more slowly today.

“No,” I said.
Teleso’s face grew sullen. He took a sip of wine and brightened a bit. “I 
keep the guest room empty most of the time,” he said. “You could have 
that room permanently, if you like.” He looked at me expectantly.
“No, thank you,” I said.
“What do you mean? Don’t you want it?”
“Not without knowing the price,” I said.
“There is no price,” he said.
“Everything has a price.”
“Really,” he said. “Including you?” He stared at me across the table with 
his cold, hard eyes and I found myself flushing with fury and shame. I 
straightened up in my chair and returned the fiercest glare I could. He 
chuckled slightly and rose, advancing on my end of the table.
“Don’t you want to be my friend, Eliana?” he asked.
“I’m afraid of what the price of your friendship might be,” I said.
“Perhaps it’s a price you’d enjoy paying.” He moved to stand behind me, 
resting his arms on the back of my chair.
“I don’t think so,” I said.
Teleso dropped his hand to rest it against my waist. “You might enjoy my 
friendship more than you think.”
“Take your hand off me,” I said.
“Don’t you find me handsome? Most women do.”
“Take your hand off rat” I said again.
Teleso stood behind me; I couldn’t push my chair back and I couldn’t

stand up. As he began to slide his hand up my side, I jerked away, then 
ducked down and under the table, rolling beneath it and coming up to 
stand and face him. “Don’t touch me.”
“Don’t be hasty,” he said, moving toward me.
I grabbed my eating knife, sending the eggshell wineglass spinning off the 
table. It smashed between us; the wine splashed onto the edge of the 
tablecloth, making a stain like blood. “Don’t,” I said, holding the knife out 
as threateningly as I could.
Teleso froze and anger flared in his face. He narrowed his eyes to stare at 
me. “That was a mistake,” he said. Ignoring the knife, he reached out and 
grabbed my hand, twisting my wrist and jerking me toward him. “I am not 
interested in unwilling women,” he hissed. “You have nothing to fear from 
me.”
I didn’t answer.
“You are throwing away quite an opportunity,” Teleso said. “Think it over.” 
He took the knife out of my hand, then released my arm and shoved me 
backward. He jerked on the bell cord with so much force he almost tore it 
off the lever. “Now get out.”
One of his soldiers escorted me back up to my room. I rang the bell for 
Arianna, but she didn’t come. No one else did, either.
The sun shone through the window high on the wall; when I pulled the 
chair over to peer out, I could see people assembling in the piazza for the 
funeral. I climbed up on the chair and tuned my violin, then started to 
play, still watching the people below. They could hear me; I saw an excited 
figure pointing up, then gathering other people to come stand under the 
window.

This is the dance that turned the storm. I played Lucia’s dance now, from 
the window, and below me people clasped hands to step back and forth. 
Side-together-side skip. Front-together-front skip. Side-together-side 
skip. Back-together-back skip. I tried to spot Lucia in the courtyard below, 
but she wasn’t there. This is what Beneto was waiting for. I could feel the 
nervous energy rising like steam from the dancers below.
Two soldiers came to the courtyard as I watched. They sent the dancers 
away. One spoke quietly to each dancer, gesturing quickly and pointing 
toward the keep; the other grabbed one of the dancers roughly by the arm, 
shoving her out of the circle. Niccolo? No, Niccolo had fairer hair. I didn’t 
know this soldier. At the sound of my playing, he looked up toward the 
window, shading his eyes with his hand. I imagined a venomous glare, but 
I couldn’t see him clearly enough to tell. With the dancers scattered, 
though, I stepped down from my chair by the window, putting down my 
violin.
Who will lead us now? Lucia’s question still haunted me. Those dancers 
under my window deserved a leader who believed in them. All the 
prisoners at Ravenna deserved a leader who believed in them. They 
deserved better than Giovanni—in fact, they deserved better than Beneto, 
for all his bright-eyed charisma. I paced the room, my violin in my hand.
I stopped in front of the mirror and tucked the violin under my chin. 
Closing my eyes, I played the funeral song as I’d played it for Mira, when 
she was ill the first time. I danced as I played—I didn’t know the steps that 
Lucia knew, so I let the music carry me. As I whirled with the final cascade 
of notes, I opened my eyes and found myself facing the mirror. That night 
I played for Mira in her illness, I saw an image of a soldier with my face.

Looking into the mirror now, I saw that soldier again, but it no longer 
frightened me.
Laying my violin down on the bed, I reached behind me to the buttons of 
the dress. There were scores of buttons, tiny and out of my reach. I 
unfastened the first few. Then, closing my eyes and gripping the collar of 
the dress, I tore it off my body. Buttons scattered across the floor like 
spilled stones, and I stepped out of the heap of velvet at my feet.
My clothes were still under the bed; they were slightly damp, but I could 
live with that. I put on the tunic and trousers, and belted the tunic with the 
red sash. The beads and ribbons took some time to remove from my hair, 
but I managed. The copper clip I’d used to secure my hair had vanished 
with Arianna, so I used a single ribbon to tie it back. Then I looked into the 
mirror again. I was ready.
* * *
A soldier I hadn’t seen before delivered my supper—gruel. I ate it quickly, 
not really tasting it. I was too nervous to be hungry, but as always before a 
concert, I forced the food down. The door swung open as I scraped the last 
of the gruel from the bowl, and Teleso froze, looking at me, my clothes, the 
dress crumpled on the floor. “Why did you take off the dress?” he asked. 
His voice trembled like a rejected child’s.
“The price was too high,” I said, and his face grew as cold as his eyes.
“Come,” he said, and turned away without offering me his arm. I trailed 
him down the stairs. Just before we reached the doorway of the keep, he 
reached back to grab my hand, tucking it into the crook of his arm and 
pinning it against his side. Soldiers joined us, and escorted us out of the 
keep.

The light was fading from the edge of the hills; I stared into the shadowy 
sea of faces, trying to make them out. The area around the piazza had been 
cleared of tents again. The crowd was quiet, frighteningly so. Teleso led me 
to the scaffold, then up the steps and on to the platform. No ropes hung 
tonight, but the cross-beam was directly over my head; I wished fervently 
that there was some other platform for me to stand on. Teleso let go of my 
arm and held up his hands for silence.
“Enemies of Ravenna will be dealt with,” he said. “Thieves and marauders 
will be punished. However, I am not without mercy. You may give them 
whatever funeral you wish. Their bodies have been returned to you.” He 
gestured, and I looked down to see two shrouded bodies at the foot of the 
scaffold. He turned to me, smiling into my horrified face. “They’re all 
yours,” he said to me, and stepped lightly down the stairs, retreating to the 
keep. I was alone.
The crowd held its breath as I took a moment to retune my violin. My 
hands shook slightly as I tucked it under my chin, then started playing, 
sluggish in the damp air. Da dat da da dat da wham wham wham. Da dat 
da da dat da wham wham wham. The people were stamping their feet on 
the down beats, clapping their hands. “Come on!” I heard Lucia shout. 
“Step—wait—left behind left turn, left.”
Slowly, like a vast mill slowly grinding to life, the crowd began to move. 
Dancing. Da dat da da dat da wham wham wham. My hands were 
warming; without meaning to, I sped up the music slightly. People 
responded. All around me, everywhere, they danced, moving in a slow 
circle around the platform.
The crowd was vast and packed shoulder-to-shoulder. Still, I could feel

their energy, like a flame the moment before the log splits into fire. They 
were angry; their fury billowed around us like smoke. Da dat da da dat da 
wham wham wham. I started trying to hold the tempo back, but it wasn’t 
working—they were speeding up, with or without me. The energy swelled. 
It vibrated behind my eyes like the wood of my violin, or the swarm of bees 
I’d felt when I played this with Mira and Bella and the others back at the 
conservatory. It was difficult to breathe.
The crowd’s anger rose with the energy like an unstoppable tide, like an 
earthquake. They wanted to see Teleso’s blood. My heart was beating loud 
enough to hear it in my ears. They were dancing faster. This was nothing 
like playing with Mira and Bella; I was the violin, played by the anger of 
the crowd.
A few paces from the scaffold, I could see Lucia and Giovanni dancing. 
Lucia’s eyes were closed; Giovanni’s were wide open, and riveted on me. 
Our strength is in numbers, I remembered Beneto’s voice saying. If you 
get people angry enough. We just have to get people angry enough. This 
was what he had been waiting for, and now Giovanni was going to make it 
work. Lucia’s lips were moving; she was singing the words to the song, 
which I could barely make out over the stamping feet. The dance was 
almost over. The anger was rising like a flooding river, waters that would 
smash everything in their path and carry the debris until the water was 
spent, soaked into the earth. I could unleash that against the camp—drown 
the keep in the anger like floodwaters would drown a hut— and my head 
spun with the power flashing through me.
The last fading rays of the day fell across the edge of the crowd. Just 
beyond the dancers, I saw a glint like the evening star—it was the sun

catching on the tip of a crossbow bolt. Staring into the shadows, I realized 
that there was a ring of soldiers, beyond the dancers, crossbows drawn. Of 
course; Teleso knew this was coming as well as Giovanni did. From where 
I stood, though, I could see who the crossbows were pointed at. Enemies of 
Ravenna will be dealt with. This was why Lucia’s name was circled on 
Teleso’s list. As soon as the riot broke out, they were going to kill Lucia. 
For a moment my own anger roared in my ears, drowning out the anger of 
the crowd, and I realized what I could do. Bastards won’t shoot unless 
there’s trouble.
The dance was ending; I couldn’t just stop playing, because people would 
take that as the signal for the riot to start. Gritting my teeth, I decreased 
the tempo of the music. I wasn’t sure if this would make the dancers slow 
down, but it did. I slowed it more. The buzzing in my head became 
disjointed, confused, but this wasn’t working well enough. I felt like a 
fragile dam trying to hold back a blinding white river of anger. I closed my 
eyes and concentrated. Opening myself to the tide, I poured the energy 
into the earth under my feet, like rainwater into a field. Down.
My E-string snapped. The dance ended. Instead of exploding into a riot, 
though, people stopped, heads bowed, and slowly shuffled off, back toward 
the tents. Lucia looked around, drained and confused. She didn’t know 
what had happened, what had gone wrong. But Giovanni did. I could feel 
his glare burning against me like magefire; if he could have killed me right 
then, he would have. “Damn you,” he hissed, and I met his eyes for a long 
moment across the dark sea. “Traitor.”
Something jerked me backward, and I realized that Teleso had come up 
the steps to the scaffold and grabbed my arm. “Let’s go,” he said, and 
file:///C|/Downloads/Kritzer,%20Naomi%20-%20Eliana%...Eliana%2001]%20-%20Fires%20of%20the%20Faithful.html (285 of 400)08/02/2006 11:47:47

yanked me back down the steps. “You made the wrong choice.”
“My violin case,” I protested as Teleso dragged me into the keep.
“Shut up!” he shouted, and backhanded me across the face. I didn’t see it 
coming; the impact knocked me back against the wall. Teleso jerked me 
toward him again, then shoved me toward one of the soldiers. “Lock her 
up.” The soldier stared at Teleso. “You heard me! Lock her up.”
The soldier took my arm, leading me down a narrow staircase. “It’s all 
right,” he whispered. “One of us will get the case for you.”
“There was supposed to be a riot this evening,” I said.
“Yes,” the soldier said. “I don’t know what it was you did, but thank you.” 
He stopped where he was and released me to look into my eyes, wincing at 
the bruise forming across my cheek. “My orders were to shoot Signora 
Lucia. I didn’t want to.”
“What’s your name?” I asked. “You speak with a Verdiano accent. Does 
your family live near here?”
“No, thank the Lady. I am Verdiano, but my family lives well north of the 
wasteland. My name is Tomas.”
My cheek was beginning to ache and I pressed my hand against it, hoping 
that the cold from my hand would ease the swelling. “So you were 
supposed to reduce the number of mouths to feed, and take out Lucia.”
“Yes.” Tomas looked angry. “But we’re soldiers, not murderers. We won’t 
kill unarmed people in cold blood.” He met my eyes hesitantly. “That’s 
what Mario says.”
Mario. Why was I not surprised?
“Isn’t it just as bad to deliberately provoke a riot, just to have an excuse to

kill people?”
Tomas’s gaze faltered. “Probably,” he said. He was young, much younger 
than Mario, and he suddenly looked tragically sad.
“Never mind, Tomas,” I said. “It isn’t your fault. You’d better take me 
wherever it is you’re supposed to be taking me. Are you pulling a double 
shift already?”
“Yeah,” he said with a tired smile. “This way.”
We made our way down a hallway, then down another staircase that led to 
a row of cells. Tomas hesitated, looking embarrassed to be locking me up. 
“I heard you play, the other night,” he said. “You’re really good.”
“Thank you,” I said. I considered offering to play for him right there, but I 
was too tired. It was chilly, deep under the keep, and I shivered. “Can I 
have a blanket? It’s cold down here.”
“Oh!” he said, and looked around. “Here, you can have my cloak.” He 
shrugged off his black-and-red cloak and wrapped it around my shoulders.
“Is this allowed?” I asked.
Tomas shrugged. “I don’t think I’ll get into too much trouble.” He shuffled 
his feet. “Is there anything else I can do for you?”
I loosened the strings of my violin and laid it carefully on the stone slabs of 
the floor, wondering how I was going to get a new E-string. “One thing,” I 
said. “Am I a dangerous enough prisoner to rate a guard? I’d rather Teleso 
not visit me unescorted.”
Tomas blushed. “I understand, Signora Eliana. I’ll talk to Mario—he’ll 
arrange something.” He closed the door to the cell.
Even with the cloak, I was chilled. Without Tomas’s candle, the dungeon

was darker than anywhere I’d ever been. I couldn’t even see my hand in 
front of my face. I wrapped the cloak around me and curled up on the floor 
of the cell. I could hear my heart beating, and an echo of something else—I 
imagined I could hear a heart beating in the ground under my ear, or the 
echoes of the stamping feet earlier. The sound lulled me and comforted 
me, and I drifted off to sleep.
* * *
I closed my eyes, knowing that in an instant I would feel my flesh burn, 
and there was nothing I could do about it. As I heard the screams of my 
friends, though, I felt no pain. Unbelieving, I opened my eyes, and 
realized that as the magefire burned the air around me, it didn’t touch me.
I turned toward the hill. Five mages— that was all it took. I couldn’t see 
their faces, but suddenly I knew with utter certainty who one of them 
was, and that she was protecting me. Even as she killed everyone else.
* * *
I woke with a start in utter darkness. I was jumpy and imagining things 
that I couldn’t see, and without really thinking about it, I cupped my hand 
to summon witchlight.
To my shock, a dim glow leapt to life and stayed there. In the feeble but 
steady white light, I could see Mario sleeping in the guard’s chair, on the 
other side of my bars. I stared at the light and, after a moment or two, let it 
go out and lay back down.
Our magefire drained the Verdiani borderlands of every drop of energy 
and life they had.
Witchlight doesn’t work here. No magery does.

FIRES OF THE FAITHFUL - NAOMI KRITZER
I thought about the surge of energy I’d poured into the earth. Could this be 
done, for all of the wastelands? Or would you need the kind of anger that 
could start a riot? Or was I dreaming? I drifted back to sleep.
I woke later to find Mario shaking me gently. “Teleso wants you outside,” 
he said. I sat up and rubbed my eyes.
“Tomas’s cloak,” I said.
“I’ll get it back to him,” he said, so I took it off and laid it across Mario’s 
arm.
“My violin,” I said.
“We have the case,” he said. “Will you trust me to take care of your violin? 
I’ll return it to you later.”
I didn’t want to let him take it, but I wasn’t sure I had a choice, so I nodded 
and gave him the violin and bow. He took the violin gingerly, like he was 
afraid the thin wood would break, and I laughed and showed him how to 
hold it. “Don’t go swinging it around like a club,” I said, “and don’t drop it, 
but it’s not going to break in your hands or anything.”
He tucked it under his arm. “Ready?” he asked.
“For what?” I said, but he avoided my eyes.
I followed Mario up the stairs; we were joined by a larger group of soldiers 
and Mario passed my violin off to Tomas. They marched me out the side 
entrance. “There she is!” someone shouted, and I saw Lucia and Giovanni 
and a few others. I could tell Giovanni was still furious, even from here, 
but Lucia just looked worried. The soldiers led me up onto the scaffold to 
stand next to Teleso. For a split second I was terrified that he was about to 
have me hanged, but there weren’t any nooses.

Instead of making a speech to the onlookers, Teleso turned to me. He was 
as angry as he had been the previous evening, maybe even angrier. “I 
treated you with courtesy and hospitality,” he said. “I offered you comfort 
and safety. And you spit on the hand I extended. Do you have anything to 
say for yourself?”
I raised my voice slightly. “I averted a riot. Is that why you’re angry? Why 
does the commander of Ravenna want a riot?”
“Shut up!” he shouted, then lowered his voice again. “You could still 
apologize, Eliana. If you apologize sincerely enough, you might be able to 
persuade me to reopen the offer I made yesterday.”
I felt my face flush and I drew myself up to my full height, pitching my 
voice to be heard by everyone watching. “My body is not for sale, Teleso.”
His face slammed shut and he nodded once. Then he turned to the 
soldiers. “Tie her.”
Mario and the others took hold of my arms, Mario still avoiding my eyes. 
They bound my hands to the cross beam of the scaffold. Someone untied 
my sash, then pulled my tunic over my head, and I realized they were 
going to whip me.
I could feel Teleso’s eyes burning into my naked back and my face became 
scarlet. “For insolence,” Teleso shouted to the crowd. “For attempting to 
instigate a riot. For insubordination. Thirty lashes.”
I couldn’t see the conversation behind me, but I could hear it. “Mario can 
do it,” I heard Teleso say. Then Mario’s voice: “This is goatshit, Teleso, and 
you know it!”
“Fine,” Teleso’s voice, gloating. “Wouldn’t want to make you do anything 
you thought was wrong. Niccolo can do it.” I heard a choking gasp from

Mario, and someone else coming up onto the scaffold, then everyone 
moving out of the way. Then Teleso’s voice again: “And I’ll deal with you 
later, Mario.”
I clenched my hands into fists and tried to brace myself. There were a few 
moments of silence; Niccolo was letting me get scared, and I wished I 
could turn around to spit in his face. Then the lash hissed through the air 
and came down, and I felt my back tear like rent cloth.
I bit down on the edge of my tunic and managed to keep from crying out. 
There were tears in my eyes, but no one could see them. If I couldn’t spit in 
their faces, I could deny Niccolo and Teleso the pleasure of hearing me cry 
out. My blood pounded in my ears; I tried to focus on not crying out, like 
that would distract me from the lashing. I tried to count, but I kept losing 
track. I could smell my blood, and my stomach lurched; I gagged on my 
saliva. I clenched my fists, screwing my eyes shut, and waited for it to be 
over.
“That’s thirty,” I heard Mario’s outraged shout, but the whip came down 
once more.
“Oops,” I heard another voice say smoothly, and knew that must be 
Niccolo. Someone cut the rope around my wrists and I fell to the floor of 
the scaffold. I lay for a moment, my eyes closed, trying to get my legs to 
obey me. There was a scuffle somewhere near me, and I heard Mario’s 
voice speaking low and urgently. “Do yourself a favor, Teleso, and leave 
her.” Mario picked me up and lowered me off the scaffold into Lucia’s 
arms. “Take care of her,” he muttered.
My legs still weren’t holding me up; my head spun, and the edges of my 
vision were wavering. Lucia eased my tunic back over my head and I

nearly cried out as the wool rubbed against my back.
“My violin,” I said.
“I have it,” Lucia said. “Mario gave it to me.” She had slung my arm over 
her shoulders and was holding me up. Rafi ducked under my other arm. 
“Let’s get you home.”
My sight was clearing. “Let me sit down a minute,” I said. “I think if I wait 
for a moment or two, I’ll be able to stand by myself.” As soon as we were 
past the edge of the piazza, they let me sit.
People were staring at me from their tents again, I realized. I could see 
them peering out. But it was a different kind of stare, now. “She didn’t cry 
out,” I heard someone say, “not once. Just about told Teleso to go screw 
the horses, too.” Beyond Lucia, I could see a stranger touch his fist to his 
chest, then hold it out silently as he met my eyes.
“I think I can walk, if you’ll help me,” I said to Lucia, and she gave me her 
hand. I winced as I stood up, but I felt oddly buoyed. Rafi smiled at me 
kindly, and Lucia’s eyes glowed with her own inner light. On the other side 
of Lucia, I caught Giovanni’s eye. Pure malevolence met me, and I smiled 
back at him. Teleso had just made a serious mistake.
“Beneto was wrong,” I said to Lucia, once again pitching my voice to be 
heard by the onlookers. “Our strength is not just in numbers. Our strength 
is in our hearts. Our will is stronger than Teleso’s. When the time comes, 
we will fight him. And we will win.”

There is power in strangeness. 
 
—The Journey of Gèsu, chapter 7, verse 2. 
 
 
Isabella was at the door of Rafi’s tent almost as soon as Lucia had gotten 
me settled. “She’s resting,” I heard Lucia say, but I interrupted her.
“I’m fine,” I said. “Tell her to come in.”
I was lying on my stomach, a wet cloth across my back; I propped myself 
up on my elbows when Isabella came in. “I’ve sent for Petro,” Isabella said. 
“He’s one of my closest friends, and the best healer in Ravenna.”
“Would you like some tea?” Rafi asked Isabella. “Eliana got us some of the 
good kind a few nights ago.”
“Yes, thank you,” she said, settling against one of the rolled-up blankets. 
Giovanni glowered at her; she ignored him completely. Rafi brewed the tea 
and there were several heartbeats of strained silence.
“So what are you doing here?” Giovanni asked Isabella. “Come to tell us 
babes how we can’t do anything right?”
“You’d be well served to listen to me more often,” Isabella said mildly,

taking the cup of tea Rafi handed to her. “As would Eliana here. That 
funeral was an excellent opportunity.” She looked at me over the cup. “You 
have much to answer for, girl.”
“I will lead a breakout,” I said. “But I will do it on my own terms.”
“What are your terms?” Isabella asked as Giovanni sputtered.
“We are peasants, not targets for crossbow bolts or fuel for magefire,” I 
said. “Our strength is not just in numbers, it is in our arms and our hearts. 
When we break out, we’ll know how to fight, and how to work together so 
that we can watch each other’s backs instead of getting in each other’s way. 
We’ll wrest the crossbows from the hands of the soldiers who don’t throw 
them down. We’ll break out when Teleso is not fully prepared for a riot. 
And Lucia will not be the first to fall, as she was supposed to be last night.” 
I gave Giovanni a measured look, and he glowered back at me.
“You will lead a breakout!” he sputtered. “You. You? Her?”
“Where you lead, Generale,” Isabella said, “I will follow, and so will those 
who follow me.” She touched her fist to her chest and held it out in a salute.
This was too much for Giovanni. “Generale? Generale! With Beneto and 
Jesca gone, I am the Generale of the Third Army.”
“You may be the Generale of the Third Army,” I said, “but I am the 
Generale of the Army of Ravenna.”
“I can’t believe I’m hearing this,” Giovanni said. “You’re all traitors! All of 
you!” He leapt to his feet and stormed out.
Rafi shrugged. “Eliana’s right,” he said to Lucia. “People will follow her 
now.”
“She’s still a stranger here,” Lucia said.

“ ‘There is power in strangeness,’ ” Rafi said.
Isabella snorted. “That’s just a nice way of saying that because she’s new, 
no one hates her yet.”
“People may hate me soon enough,” I said, “but at least they won’t hate me 
because I want to make them learn how to fight with swords they’ll never 
have.”
Isabella smiled slowly. “Don’t take my support for granted, Generale-girl. 
You may lose us yet. But for now ... we’re with you.” She set down her cup. 
“If you’ll excuse me. Petro should be here soon.” She ducked out.
“Petro better not be one of those healers that likes to use salves that sting,” 
I said. Rafi laughed. Lucia was still staring after Isabella. “Lucia,” I said, 
and she looked up. “How many people does Isabella lead?”
“More than Beneto did, honestly,” Lucia said. “Although her influence 
doesn’t extend beyond Ravenna.”
“And she’s—what did you say she does, exactly?”
“Isabella is an old-time dissenter,” Lucia said. “She was making trouble for 
the Circle back when we were babies. Or at least complaining a lot.” She 
shrugged. “Isabella never committed herself to Beneto. That’s quite a coup 
you just made.”
“Giovanni’s going to be furious,” I said.
“He’s already furious,” Rafi said. “As you knew he would be.” He picked up 
Isabella’s cup and finished off the last few drops of tea. “So, Generale 
Eliana: where do you intend to lead us?”
“Out of Ravenna,” I said.
“And then?” Rafi wiped out the cup and put it away. “Beneto could never

answer this question for me. What then? March on Cuore?”
I hesitated. “Yes,” I said. “Eventually.”
“Everyone here? Children and grannies?”
“No, we’ll have to send them somewhere else.”
“Where?”
“I don’t know,” I said. “But I’ll think of something.”
Ran smiled. “And food? Supply lines? You won’t have the Cuore 
bureaucracy shuttling food to you.”
“No,” I said. “I suppose not.”
“How will you feed your army?”
“I’ll figure something out for that, too,” I said. “Before I lead the breakout.”
Rafi suddenly smiled at me, a radiant grin that took over his entire face. 
“Answer those questions, signora, and I am yours to command.” His smile 
faded to a wry hesitation. “Assuming I like the answers, of course.”
“Of course,” I said.
Lucia was smiling. “Giovanni’s going to kill me.”
“He’d better not,” I said.

followers, at least when they care to listen to me. We stand behind you, 
Generale.”
I regarded the two of them. “Why?” I asked. “Just because I told off Teleso 
and got beaten for it?”
“The truth is,” Rafi said, “we need a leader. Isabella knows it, and so do the

other groups in Ravenna. Beneto had the wit and charisma to pull people 
together, at least some of the time. Giovanni does not.”
“So people will follow me because I’m the alternative to Giovanni?”
“You understand your position pretty well,” Rafi said.
Lucia tipped her head and narrowed her eyes as she regarded me. “You do 
realize that you will still need Giovanni. We may all accept you as our 
general, but Beneto’s old commanders won’t. As far as they’re concerned, 
Giovanni is the only one qualified to lead. So long as you send Giovanni to 
deal with them, you should be all right. But you’ll have to come to terms 
with him, sooner or later.”
The healer arrived shortly after that. Petro was an old man who walked 
with a limp. He had a tiny store of herbs, which he could not replenish 
here in Ravenna and guarded jealously; Isabella had evidently ordered 
him to use some of them up to treat me. The salve didn’t sting, although 
being touched hurt enough as it was. When Petro had left, Lucia said, “You 
can lead the uprising starting tomorrow. For the rest of today, you’re going 
to rest.” I’m not sure how she kept Giovanni from coming back to the tent, 
but I dozed peacefully for the rest of the day.
By the next morning, I had settled on my top priority: military training. 
Not only did we need to train people to fight as a cohesive force, we needed 
to train more than the handful that Giovanni could teach in his tiny 
training ground. The trouble was, I couldn’t imagine Teleso sitting still for 
mass military exercises. I raised the issue over morning gruel.
“We’re not stupid,” Giovanni said. “Of course we’d like to train more 
people. There’s just no way to hide more than a handful.”
“Don’t fool yourself,” I said. “Teleso knows you’re there. He probably just

figures it’s a harmless diversion, like the Old Way.”
“Well, I think Teleso would see more than a handful as more than a 
diversion,” Rafi said.
“We need a way to disguise military training as a diversion,” I said.
“There’s no way,” Giovanni said. “You’re being ridiculous. This is what 
happens when someone who doesn’t know the first thing about the subject
—”
“What exactly is it you want to train people to do?” Lucia asked, pressing 
her hands to her head as if to shut out Giovanni.
“Fight as a group. Watch each other’s backs. Move when the others move. 
Work together without getting in each other’s way.”
“An army is not an orchestra,” Giovanni said, and stalked out.
I watched him go, then turned back to my breakfast, scraping the sides of 
the bowl with my fingers to get the last of the gruel. When Lucia had also 
finished eating, I eased on my tunic and we went down to Giovanni’s 
practice ground.
Giovanni was bullying Michel again. He called a break as soon as we came 
in and snarled, “You’re going against Beneto’s explicit orders.”
“You took orders from Beneto,” I said. “I didn’t. And Beneto’s dead.”
“You’re not the one in charge here,” he said. “I am!”
I glanced past Giovanni at the seven boys clustered against the wall. 
Michel’s face had lit up when I walked in, and something caught my eye. 
He had discarded his worn belt and replaced it with a red sash similar to 
mine. So had the others.
I lowered my voice and spoke just to Giovanni. “Giovanni, look around

you. Who do you think they’re going to follow? You’ll be less embarrassed 
if you back down now.”
Giovanni’s face went red, then white, and his lips tightened. He turned 
with mute appeal toward Lucia, but she stared him down.
“We’ll see,” he said, backing out of the training ground. “We’ll see.” He 
turned and ran out. I didn’t watch him go.
Michel and the others edged away from the wall. On a signal from Michel, 
they formed a ragged line and saluted me in unison. “What are your 
orders, Generale?” Michel asked.
“You know how to fight,” I said. “With a weapon or your fists. That’s not 
what you need to learn. What you need to learn is how to fight together.” I 
looked them over. “Round up a few more. Then practice fighting as a group
— three against three, four against four, five against five. And pull your 
punches. Am I clear?”
“Yes, Generale,” Michel said; the others nodded.
I sat down to watch them train; Lucia sat down beside me. They quickly 
divided into a group of three and a group of four, and started to circle the 
training ground. Michel was tall and broad-shouldered like my brothers, 
but with a surprisingly light, quick step; he was by far the best fighter in 
the group. He didn’t seem like the sort who’d be graceful; he seemed like 
he should be slow and awkward like my brothers, but he wasn’t. “Are we 
just supposed to beat on each other?” Michel asked after a little while.
“No. You need a goal, I guess. Hmm. Pretend—uh, pretend those sticks are 
crossbows. Three of you can be soldiers—you have the crossbows. The 
other four are Ravenessi—you try to take the crossbows away.”

After a few more false starts, we worked out the basic rules of the game. 
They switched to six on one, with the one playing the soldier. As long as 
the soldier had the “crossbow,” he could “shoot” a Ravenesse every few 
seconds by stopping, pointing the stick, and calling out the person’s name.
“It takes more time than that to cock a crossbow,” Michel said.
“Stick with these rules for now,” I said.
Watching them, I was suddenly reminded of games I’d played with my 
brothers, back when I was a child. Watching my army now was like 
watching a group of deadly serious grown-ups playing tag.
“That’s it,” I said aloud.
“What?” Lucia asked.
“This is how we’re going to train the whole camp. Everyone who wants to 
fight. We’ll make it a game.” I turned to Lucia, and she shook her head, 
trying to understand my excitement. “Everyone can learn—everyone can 
play. Don’t you see? Teleso doesn’t care how we amuse ourselves. As long 
as it’s a game, we can play it openly. We can train the whole camp that 
way.”
Michel and the others had paused to watch my excitement. “Are there 
others in Ravenna who would learn to fight if there was a way?” I asked.
“Yes,” Michel said. “Many. There isn’t space.”
“Listen,” I said. “We don’t need space. We’re going to call this game 
pastore e lupi, shepherd-and-wolves, instead of soldiers-and-prisoners, 
but the rules—and the purpose— stay the same.”
Michel and the others nodded, still a bit baffled.
“The wolves try to take away the shepherd’s bow; the shepherd tries to

take down the wolves. If all the wolves are dead before the shepherd loses 
his bow, the shepherd wins. If the wolves can take away the bow without 
losing more than half the wolves, they win. Play it in the open— the wolves 
can start from farther back, and the shepherd has to wait longer between 
shots. If it gets too easy, change the odds.” I looked around the circle of 
boys, and saw them catching my excitement. “Practice for a day. Then I 
want you to start teaching others. People can play after they come back 
from work .. . it’s almost midsummer, and the soldiers have been bringing 
them back well before dark. Don’t you see? So far as Teleso will know, this 
is just a game. Keep it quiet, at first. I’m hoping the game will catch on fast 
enough that Teleso won’t know where it started.”
They were nodding more enthusiastically now. “Yes, Generale,” Michel 
said, and they went back to the game.
When they stopped to rest, some time later, I took Michel aside.
“The seven of you already knew how to fight,” I said. He nodded. “That 
won’t be true for everyone with willing hands. I want you to find out how 
many people seem interested, but really don’t know what they’re doing, all 
right? I want them trained to fight—by you, or by someone else. This 
training ground may see some use yet.”
“And Giovanni?”
“We need all the allies we can get,” I said. “Even Giovanni.” I grimaced so 
that he knew I understood. “Say, where’d you get that sash, anyway?”
Michel grinned broadly. “There was a lady with a red blanket. She traded 
for a brown one and some extra ration chits.”
“Was it your idea?” I asked. He nodded. I slugged him affectionately on the 
shoulder. “I’m not sure I like the way you think, big brother. But it looks

good on you.”
On Lucia’s suggestion, I made the rounds while people were lined up for 
evening gruel, as Beneto had. To show them who was in charge, and that I 
was back on my feet. People smiled at me warmly, clasped my hands. I 
didn’t know how to work a crowd like Beneto, but the mystique of standing 
up to Teleso would carry me for a while yet—I hoped.
Later in the evening, Lucia and I got our own gruel. “Do you want to come 
to Mass later?” Lucia asked, as we waited in line.
“I ... I think dancing would hurt my back,” I said. “Playing, too; I’d have to 
rest the violin on my shoulder. I’ll come another day.”
“All right,” she said. My cheeks burned as her eyes searched across my 
face, but I met her eyes without flinching. It was an excuse, but it was a 
reasonable one. Once we had our gruel, she excused herself briefly to go 
speak with Rafi, and I cupped my hands around my bowl, waiting near the 
shadow of the keep. I really was exhausted, I realized suddenly, and my 
raw back burned under my tunic.
“Hey, signora,” a voice said softly behind my shoulder. I turned. It was the 
kind soldier, Mario, looking tired and ashamed.
“Mario,” I said. “How are you doing?”
Mario shrugged. “How are you doing?” he asked, gesturing toward my 
shoulder.
“Better than it looks like you expected,” I said. “I’m on my feet and the 
wounds aren’t festering.”
Mario lowered his eyes again. I stood uselessly, knowing that he blamed 
himself but not knowing what to say.

“I’m sorry,” he said, a few moments later. “Way too much of that was my 
fault.”
“Because you carried the message from Lucia? Because you helped to tie 
me? Because you told Teleso you wouldn’t beat me, so he had Niccolo do 
it?” All of those; it was all of those things and more. “Mario, you’re one of 
the few people in Ravenna who actually wants to do the right thing. Who 
even cares what the right thing is. Don’t you think that’s worth 
something?”
“I care,” he said. “But not enough. Or I wouldn’t have stood there and let 
them whip you.” He lowered his head again.
“What do you think you should have done?”
“I don’t know,” he said.
I looked around; Lucia showed no sign of returning. “Let’s go for a walk,” I 
said.
Mario and I went out to the hills around Ravenna, walking along the edge 
of the fence.
“You lead the reformers now, don’t you?” Mario said. “Not Giovanni.”
I hesitated for a moment; was this really the sort of thing I should be 
admitting to one of Teleso’s soldiers, even one I liked?
“It’s all right,” he said. “I don’t blame you for not telling me. But everyone 
knows.”
“Does Teleso have plans for me yet?” I asked.
“Not yet. But you know, Eliana—you’re setting yourself up. That’s why no 
one but Giovanni is challenging you for leadership. They’re hoping that the 
next time Teleso decides someone should swing, it will be you and not

them.”
I was silent. Mario sat down on the dusty hillside, and I sat down beside 
him. “Thank you for keeping an eye on me, that night in the dungeon,” I 
said.
“It was nothing.”
“Is there anyone in this valley who wants to be here?”
“Teleso,” Mario said. “But other than him, no.” He chuckled dryly. “They 
promised us that when the war was over, we’d receive our pay and be 
released from our oath to the Emperor. But somehow they decided the war 
hadn’t quite ended ... so here we are guarding the lot of you. Even Niccolo 
resents it; he says the Circle should send down some bureaucrats to build 
the wall if they want one—hire architects and laborers like they would to 
build a monument in Cuore. But, well, the bureaucrats would have 
refused. And the Circle has to have its damn wall.”
“Mario,” I said. “Where do you stand? I need to know. Are you with me, in 
the end, or with Teleso?”
Mario was silent for a long time. “I know what’s happening here is wrong. 
The Lady—” He glanced down at me and added, “I don’t expect you to 
understand. You’re Redentore, like Lucia. I hope you don’t hold it against 
me that I’m not.”
I shook my head. “Of course not.”
“The Lady has said that slavery is wrong. When she brought her Gift to 
Gaius, and told him the path we were to follow, that was one of the first 
things she said; we are all Her children and belong only to Her. And 
slavery is what’s going on here, no matter what kind of word games Teleso 
and the Circle play with it.”

FIRES OF THE FAITHFUL - NAOMI KRITZER
I nodded.
“And is it truly what the Emperor wants?” Mario said. “I swore my oath to 
the Emperor, not to the Circle. But Teleso takes orders from the Circle. 
That’s become blindingly clear to all of us.”
I blinked. Bella and Mira had both said that the Emperor didn’t really rule. 
I wondered if the rest of the army was as loyal to the Emperor as Mario.
“I helped to execute Beneto and Jesca. I stood by while Niccolo beat you,” 
Mario said. He tilted his head to try to meet my eyes, then looked away 
again. “If I disobey a direct order, Teleso could have me executed. And he 
would. He hates me. I don’t want to die, Eliana.”
“Mario,” I said, “I’m not asking you to throw your life away. Especially not 
when it wouldn’t do any good. It wouldn’t have done any good if you’d 
tried to protect me. But if there’s something you can do that would help—”
“I don’t know,” he said. “I don’t know if you can count on me.”
“But you know what’s right,” I said.
“Yes,” he said. “But I don’t know if I have the courage to do it.”
“Mario,” I said, and took his hand. “Won’t the Lady give you the courage 
you need?”
“What would you know about the Lady?” he said. “You’re Redentore.”
“I know what they told me when I was a child,” I said. “That She would 
always take care of me; that She wants me to do what I know in my heart is 
right; and that She would give me the strength I needed to face anything, if 
I asked.”
“But you don’t believe that anymore,” Mario said.

“It doesn’t matter what I believe, Mario,” I said. “What’s right is right, and 
you know that.”
For the first time that evening, Mario met my eyes full on. His eyes 
searched mine for a long moment. I’m not sure what he found there, but 
he squeezed my hand and said, “You’re right. I will trust in Her strength.”
“Trust Her,” I said. “And trust me, Mario. You can do what you know you 
need to do.”
“So what do you want from me?” he asked.
I held his hand tightly for a moment longer. “For now, I only needed to 
know that I will be able to trust you when I need you.” I let go of his hand 
and he took a long breath.
“Eliana,” he said. “Will you play for us again?”
“Of course,” I said. “It’s probably best if I don’t go into the keep, but if the 
soldiers can meet me somewhere outside ...”
“Of course,” he said.
“Then I’ll play as soon as my back is healed up enough that I can hold a 
violin without it hurting.” His enthusiasm turned to distress again, and I 
said, “Don’t worry about it. It wasn’t your fault, and it’s healing.”
We walked back down to Rafi’s tent. “I’ll leave you here, then,” Mario said. 
He folded my hand around something, then kissed my hand gently, before 
dropping it as if he was afraid I was going to slap him, and fleeing into the 
darkness. I opened my hand once he was gone, to see what he had given 
me: coiled tightly in my palm was a new E-string, to replace the one that 
broke during the funeral.
Ran and Lucia were still at Mass. I thought about going to bed, but despite

my exhaustion, my conversation with Mario had left me with a restless 
energy. I tucked my violin case under my arm and walked over to near 
where I knew they would be dancing. I circled the area and climbed a bit 
higher on the hill, sitting down in the shadow of the fence to watch them.
There were perhaps twenty Redentori, dancing in the moonlight. I 
recognized Lucia, Ran, Michel, and several more. Michel was even more 
graceful dancing than he was fighting; he danced with a wild enthusiasm, 
an ecstatic abandon that made my heart quicken just watching.
They had no violin tonight, but Lucia and Michel sang, his baritone 
blending with her clear alto. They paused in the dance for a moment to 
sing. Lucia’s face was shadowed, but I could fill in the details for myself. 
Her eyes were closed, her face sweet with delight in the ritual. I felt a stab 
of envy.
She will give you the strength you need to face anything. Lucia’s God gave 
her the same strength—as much as she needed. I couldn’t imagine having 
so much trust in something so powerful. Lucia knew we would succeed; I 
couldn’t be sure. In fact, I wasn’t even sure I’d wager tomorrow’s rations 
on it. It struck me that I was staking my life on it, but I was in too deep to 
back out now. From the corner of my eye, I saw movement. Giovanni sat 
down a few paces away from me, resting his chin on his arms as he 
watched the dancers.
“Do you ever envy them?” I asked.
“Why would I?”
I looked over at Giovanni. “ You never envy the strength your cousin draws 
from her faith?”
Giovanni paused. “Yes, I envy her sometimes,” he admitted.

“Were Beneto and Jesca Redentori?” I asked.
“After a fashion. They preferred that the Redentori ihink them Redentori, 
while those that pray to the Lady also claim them as theirs.” Giovanni 
shifted where he sat. “They had their own kind of faith. I think all Beneto 
needed to believe in was his cause and himself.” His voice turned bitter. 
“Isn’t that what you believe in?”
“I need more than just the cocky self-assurance of a naive schoolboy like 
Beneto,” I said. Giovanni gasped and smothered a laugh, and I knew I’d 
spoken his opinion of Beneto as well. “I need support. I need counsel.” I 
turned to Giovanni and saw him looking at me. “I need you on my side, 
Giovanni.”
“Thank you so much for your confidence in me,” he said. “You take away 
the one thing Beneto put me in charge of, and now you say you need me? 
Am I supposed to be impressed?”
“Beneto put you in charge of military training because he didn’t think it 
was important,” I said. “Was that what you wanted to be doing?”
“No,” he said.
“What was it you wanted?”
“I wanted to be in charge. I wanted to be the one to make the important 
decisions.” His voice became petulant. “I wanted to be Generale.”
“If the title means that much to you, Giovanni, I’ll call you whatever you 
want,” I said. “Look, I know as well as you do that the organization that 
sent you here will never accept me as a leader. I’ll do this with you or 
without you, but I would prefer to have you on my side.” He turned to 
glare at me and I clenched my fists, resisting the urge to smack him.

“Giovanni, I know that you would make a powerful ally. In any case, I 
think it’s fair to say that as far as the reformers are concerned, you are in 
charge. As for important decisions, you’ve got one now: are you with me, 
or against me?” He was silent. “Giovanni, I need to know where you stand. 
Do we have a truce?”
There was another long silence. Then: “Generale Giovanni,” he said.
“What?”
“Call me Generale, and I’m with you.”
We stood up, slowly, in the darkness, and looked at each other. Even when 
he stood up straight, I was taller than he was. Slowly, grudgingly, he held 
out his right hand, and I clasped it briefly. “Then, Generale,” I said, “as 
long as you understand that you take orders from me, I believe we have an 
understanding.”
I could see in the moonlight that he was clenching his teeth; he could 
probably see that I was, too.
“Yes,” he said. “We understand each other. Generale.”
On the hill below us, Mass had finished; Lucia and the others had gone 
home. “Are you coming back to Rafi’s tent?” I asked.
“Not yet,” he said, so I headed back on my own.
Rafi’s tent was on the other side of the piazza from where we were. I 
wound my way uncertainly through the maze of ragged tents, unsure of 
exactly where I was. The keep rose like a hulking shadow, my only 
landmark.
As I passed by the dark edge of a half-fallen wall, hands seized my arms 
and another clapped over my mouth. I bit down viciously on the hand that

covered my mouth, and gagged at the taste of blood as I felt the hand 
tighten in pain. Something cold and sharp pressed against my throat.
“Shut up,” a voice whispered, and the hands yanked me backward, behind 
the wall.
“Unlike your Redentore God,” a soft voice said with malicious satisfaction, 
“the Lady has told us that She does not want human sacrifices. But in your 
case, we think She’ll make an exception.”

The hands tightened, and the knife was pulled back for an instant. I knew 
that it was being drawn back for the final blow, and made a desperate 
attempt to wrench free. Then something whistled past my ear, and I heard 
the knife clatter to the ground as someone yelped. “Scatter!” a voice hissed, 
and I was turned loose as my attackers fled into the night. I stared around 
me, too stunned to move. As the surge of fear faded, my back began to

burn from the fabric rubbing against the welts.
Giovanni stepped out of the shadows. “Some Generale you are,” he said, 
and pulled his knife. He wiped it clean on a rag and then slipped it back 
into a sheath in his boot, tucking his trousers around it to conceal it.
“Did you follow me?” I said.
“It occurred to me that something like this might happen,” he said. “I 
thought it would be good to find out who wanted you dead at this point.”
“So you used me as bait.”
“Better to be bait than prey, isn’t it?” Giovanni said.
“Which was what you were turning yourself into.” He picked up the knife 
my attackers had dropped. “Let’s go before Teleso sends someone to arrest 
us for attempted murder or disturbing the peace.”
“So who were they?” I asked.
“I didn’t get a good look at most of them, but the one I wounded was a 
soldier named Rico.”
“I didn’t think they were in uniform.”
“They weren’t. Presumably, Teleso wants you assassinated rather than 
executed. Or maybe Rico and some friends decided to show some 
initiative.” We were about to cross the piazza, and Giovanni ducked into a 
shadow. “Here, you can keep this. Tuck it inside your boot.” He handed me 
the dropped knife.
“You’re cracked. I’ll cut myself.”
“You really don’t know the first thing about taking care of yourself, do 
you?” he said.
“Want me to break your arm to prove I do?”

“That won’t be necessary.” Giovanni tucked the knife into his own sleeve 
and wrapped a piece of cloth around his arm to bind it flat and secure. 
“Let’s go.”
I studied Giovanni as we crossed the piazza; he had a little bounce to his 
step. The smugness would have been obvious at twenty paces, and the self-
satisfaction at forty. “So this proved . . . ?” I asked.
“You need a bodyguard.”
“A bodyguard?” That really seemed ridiculous. “What, to follow me 
everywhere?”
“Yes,” Giovanni said. “I’ll talk to the men who’ve been training. Michel 
would make a good one, and the others can trade off with him. Also,” he 
added, and turned to give me a patronizing smile. “I’ll teach you some 
knife-fighting.”
“Knife-fighting.”
“You can have the knife the assassins dropped. We’ll make a sheath for it 
that will fit into your boot and keep it from cutting you. I’ll start training 
you tomorrow.”
Just what I need, I thought. We’d reached Rafi’s tent, and went inside.
Lucia and Rafi were horrified by the assassination attempt; Giovanni told 
them he’d headed home right after I had, and “fortunately” came upon the 
assassins just before they were going to kill me.
“Knife lessons are a good idea,” Lucia said. “This could happen again. And 
if Rico was motivated by faith, things could get even worse as we get closer 
to Dono alia Magia, at midsummer.”
I’d almost forgotten how soon the festival would be. “Did anyone ever try

to assassinate Beneto and Jesca?”
“Yes,” Giovanni said. “Once. But—” he thumped his hand on the ground 
for emphasis, “ Beneto and Jesca were never alone. Everywhere they went, 
they went together. That’s why you need a bodyguard.”
“Hmm,” Lucia said. “That’s a good idea.”
“Lucia.” I turned to her. “There was something my attackers said that I 
was wondering about. They said that the Lady didn’t want human 
sacrifices, unlike the Redentore God. What were they talking about?”
Lucia flushed angrily. “That’s just libel,” she said. “We say that through 
blood the land will be redeemed, but we mean sacramental blood, the 
wine that becomes the blood of Gèsu in the Mass.”
“Ah,” I said, and waited.
After a moment she continued. “There are those,” she admitted, “that 
would like to take that passage of scripture more literally.”
“Whose blood would they like to shed?”
“Well, Teleso’s, for starters. And the Circle’s. And their enemies, and the 
enemies of Gèsu ...”
“That seems like it could become a rather large group.”
“Well—yes. It could. But they’re wrong, anyway, and distorting scripture.” 
Lucia shook her head. “The only sacrifice that was needed is complete.”
This reminded me of something. “Hey, Lucia,” I said. “I’ve been meaning 
to tell you about this. The night I was in the dungeon—well, watch.” I 
closed my eyes for a minute to concentrate, cupped my hand, and 
summoned a tiny witchlight.
The whole tent fell silent. Giovanni reached out to hold his hand over it to

test for heat, as if he thought I’d somehow secreted a candle in my hand. 
“That’s impossible,” he said, after confirming that it was witchlight.
I closed my hand over it and let it go out. “Guess not,” I said. “Not 
anymore.”
“How?” Lucia breathed.
“When I defused the riot,” I said, “I poured the energy down into the 
ground. Maybe you’re right, Lucia—Old Way rituals really can redeem the 
earth.”
“Or blood,” Giovanni said. Lucia turned to stare at him sharply, and he 
tilted his head to look at her. “Beneto and Jesca’s blood.”
“That’s not right,” Lucia said. “It couldn’t have been their deaths.”
“Well, in a way, it might have been,” Rafi said. “The anger from their 
deaths fueled the dance as lamp oil fuels fire.”
“Either way, it doesn’t matter,” I said. “Not right now. Right now, what we 
need is to get out of Ravenna. But later—maybe the land can be restored.”
Giovanni was cupping his hand and staring at it, frustrated. “I can’t get a 
light.”
“It takes a lot of effort,” I said. “It’s probably just as well if you don’t. We 
don’t want to drain the earth again.”
“Besides,” Lucia said, batting his hand aside. “It’s a sin to use magery.”
“What?” I said. I hadn’t heard this before.
“It’s a sin,” she said.
“Because of the drain on the land?” I asked.
“No,” she said. “Because the Book of the Lady says that magery was a gift 
from the Lady. And since there is only one true God, we know it can’t be

right.”
“That makes no sense, Lucia,” I said. “The Book of the Lady also says that 
slavery is wrong. Does that mean slavery is right?”
“No, of course not.” Lucia gave me a look of earnest frustration. “There are 
plenty of reasons that slavery is wrong. But magery came only from Gaius, 
the Lady’s First Prophet—how can it be right?”
“What does it matter where it came from? I can make witchlight whether I 
believe in the Lady or not.”
“It matters, Eliana,” Lucia said.
I noticed from the corner of my eye that Giovanni was watching our 
conversation with avid interest; his eyes flicked back and forth between me 
and Lucia, a slight smirk playing on his lips. I wondered suddenly if he’d 
been through this same argument.
“I never heard this from my grandmother,” I said, “and she used to bless 
herself like a Redentore. I never heard this from Bella or Giorgi, at the 
conservatory.”
Rafi cleared his throat. “Maybe it would be easiest just to think about the 
harm magery brings to the land. It’s wrong for that reason—can you accept 
that?”
I nodded, a little reluctantly.
“It is wrong to go against God’s will,” Rafi said, “for no other reason than it 
is wrong to stand against God. But—” he caught my wrist and gave me a 
look even more earnest than Lucia’s. “But often to go against God’s word 
will also cause harm to others—and so it is wrong twice.”
“Exactly,” Lucia said.

“So magery is wrong because it goes against God, and also because it hurts 
the land.” Rafi took a breath to continue the explanation, then decided 
against it. “Don’t worry about why it goes against God, Eliana. It’s enough 
for now to know that it hurts the land.”
I nodded again, still uncertain. I wasn’t sure I liked where this line of 
reasoning was taking us. “So what else is against God’s will?”
Rafi and Lucia both laughed. “Get some sleep, Eliana,” Rafi said. “I’m too 
tired for deep theology tonight. We can continue this in the morning, can’t 
we?”
“I guess,” I said. I glanced at Giovanni; he looked a little disappointed that 
the argument was ending.
As we made our beds and lay down, Giovanni brushed my sleeve briefly 
and caught my eye; in the last of the lamplight before Rafi put out the 
light, Giovanni gave me a sardonic smile. “It really isn’t any stupider than 
some of the rules the Lady made,” he said. “Those just seem less stupid 
because you grew up with them.”
“Giovanni!” Lucia said. Her voice was shocked.
“Sorry,” he said. “Good night.”

“This is the hilt,” Giovanni said. “This is the blade.” He had carved two 
rough knives out of a piece of wood. We stood in the little training ground 
he’d been using to train Michel and the others—two mostly undamaged 
walls and a canvas sheet pulled across the gap. Teleso probably had his 
soldiers keeping a watch on it, but it was the closest thing to privacy we 
were going to get in Ravenna. “For obvious reasons, I don’t want you

waving a real knife at me while we’re practicing.” He handed me the knife.
He was going to enjoy this, I could already tell. “Do we assume that I get 
attacked with my knife already in my hand?”
“No,” he said, and took the wooden knife back. “We’re going to start with 
footwork.”
“With what?”
Giovanni had me clasp my hands behind my back, then reconsidered when 
I winced and had me put my hands on my hips instead. “The most 
important thing in knife fighting isn’t the knife, it’s how you move your 
body.”
“How about getting away from someone who grabs you?” I asked.
“We’ll get to that.” He had me follow him as he bounced oddly around on 
his feet, lunging forward, then back.
“What’s the point of this?” I asked after about a half an hour. “This is 
useless.”
“It’s only useless because you don’t know what you’re doing,” Giovanni 
said.
“Isn’t that what you’re supposed to be teaching me?” I asked. The morning 
was already growing hot; my face was damp, and my hair was sticking to 
my neck.
Giovanni turned around to face me. Far from snarling at me, he was half 
smiling; he really was enjoying seeing me run around in circles after him. 
“If you needed to teach me to play a violin, would you hand me your violin 
and a sheaf of sheet music?”
“No, of course not,” I said. “You can’t even read music.”

“Actually, I can,” he said. “I was taught at the university. But that’s beside 
the point. You’d teach me how to stand correctly, wouldn’t you? How to 
hold the violin and bow? You’d teach me to move the bow on the strings to 
make a noise that didn’t sound like a dying cat, right?”
I nodded.
“Well, I’m teaching you how to move with a knife. Trust me.”
He had me prancing in circles for another hour, then called a rest. “You’re 
not bad,” he said magnanimously.
“Thank you,” I said, clenching my teeth.
“We’d better rest for a while; Rafi will have my head if I work you too hard. 
He’s afraid you’ll get sick from your injuries.”
“I won’t,” I said.
Giovanni sat down on part of the fallen wall, tipping his head up to look at 
me. “You sound pretty sure of that,” he said with a derisive half-smirk. “I’d 
still better not take any chances. Besides, you’re out of breath. Have a 
seat.” He gestured toward another fallen stone. I sat down. I was out of 
breath, and hot and thirsty besides. Giovanni had brought along a 
wineskin to his training ground, and he tossed it to me. “Cooled tea,” he 
said. “It’s what you drink when you’re sparring at the university. Wine 
when you’re sparring will just give you a headache.”
I took a swig.
“I suppose if I’m training you I ought to tell you some principles, as well,” 
he said. “The code of honor, and all that. You’re a peasant, after all; I 
couldn’t really expect you to know.”
I looked at him over the wineskin and waited.

“Never strike from behind,” he said. “Or rather, never strike without 
warning. It’s dishonorable.”
“So, waiting behind a wall for someone, and then jumping out and killing 
them, that’s bad?”
“Exactly,” he said.
“Why should I follow this rule if my enemies aren’t going to?”
“You’re better than they are,” he said.
“What?” I said. “I’ve barely started to learn how to use a knife, and I’m up 
against trained soldiers. What do you mean I’m better than they are?”
“I mean morally better.”
“A lot of good it’s going to do me to be moral, honorable, and dead,” I said. 
“Striking from behind without warning sounds like a good way to keep 
myself alive.”
Giovanni was glaring at me. This really was my week; gain alliances with 
every leader in Ravenna, and then get every one of them angry at me over 
some article of faith. “Look,” I said. “What if I’m leading the uprising to 
break out of Ravenna, and I’ve got a crossbow, and I come upon somebody 
who’s got his back to me? What am I supposed to do then?”
“Warn him,” Giovanni said. “Then fire.”
“ Warn him?” I said. “I should say, ‘Hey you, I’m going to shoot you now’?”
Giovanni rolled his eyes. “It’s more traditional to yell an insult, or order 
him to surrender.”
“What if it’s Teleso?”
“Wouldn’t you want Teleso to know that it was you killing him?” Giovanni 
asked.

“As long as when we’re done, he’s dead and I’m not, I really don’t care,” I 
said.
Giovanni’s eyes narrowed as he stared at me. “Well, you’re a peasant,” he 
said. “I suppose it isn’t really fair to expect you to understand a 
gentleman’s code of honor.”
“And after all, you’re a gentleman,” I said. “I suppose it isn’t really fair to 
expect you to understand a commoner’s desire for survival.”
Giovanni stood up. “Let’s keep working.” He picked up the wooden knives 
and handed me one. “I think it’s time to try some attacks.” He set down his 
own knife. “We’ll assume that you’re starting the fight, and I’m unarmed. 
Attack me.” He put his hands on his hips and smiled at me.
Shrugging, I walked up and raised the knife. Giovanni caught my hand 
neatly and gave it a jerk to send me flying forward, off balance. A kick sent 
the knife spinning into the corner. “Grab it. Keep going,” he urged.
My back was too raw to roll, so I stalked to the corner and picked the knife 
back up. “Maybe you should teach me those moves,” I said.
He shrugged. “Later. Attack me again.”
I ran at him, impatient now. “Are you going to show me the right way to do 
this,” I demanded when he disarmed me again, “or are you going to keep 
me running around uselessly all day?”
“First you complain when I have you do exercises,” Giovanni said, “and 
now you’re complaining because I’ve got you holding a knife and you don’t 
know what to do with it.” He arched an eyebrow snidely. “Make up your 
mind. What do you want?”
I stepped close to Giovanni so that he had to look up to meet my eyes.

“Teach me how to break the hold the assassins put me in. Teach me how to 
hurt somebody if I have to. I want you to show me what I need to know to 
survive, Giovanni.”
He stepped back and set his knife down, looking thoughtful. “Show me 
what they did.”
“They grabbed me,” I said. “Here.” I set down my knife and moved behind 
him. “One of them pinned my arms, and put his hand over my mouth.” I 
started to cover Giovanni’s mouth with my hand, then pulled my hand 
away. “I bit him. The other one had a knife to my throat, here.” I picked up 
the knife again and showed him. “When they were going to kill me, they 
pulled it back, like this, to stab.”
“Huh,” Giovanni said. “Rico must not know much about knife fighting; he 
should’ve just cut your throat. I mean—not that I wish he had. But—uh. I’ll 
show you how to get out of the hold.”
Giovanni led me through a series of moves designed to break most 
common holds. I felt more in my element now; this was like what my 
brother Donato had taught me when I was a child. “Keep going,” Giovanni 
urged me as I broke free. “Pretend I attacked you. What are you going to 
do now?”
I kicked out, hooking Giovanni’s ankle with my foot and jerking it out from 
under him. He squawked in surprise and fell in a heap; I jumped on top of 
him, one knee in his stomach, hand raised. “Never mind!” Giovanni 
yelped. “Let me up.”
I climbed off Giovanni and he got up, brushing himself off. “I guess you 
know how to fight without a knife,” he said. “Hold out your hand.” I held 
out my hand as if I were going to clasp Giovanni’s. He put the knife in my

hand, point down, blade out. I closed my hand around the knife, 
tentatively raising the knife to stab. “Wrong,” Giovanni said, and turned 
my fist so that the knife pointed out away from my body. “The easiest way 
to do some damage in a knife-fight is to hold the knife like this. Don’t stab. 
Just punch, then drag the blade.” He took his own knife and demonstrated 
a slashing sideways blow. “You probably won’t kill anybody this way, but it 
shows you’re serious, and dangerous. Anyone expecting easy prey will 
probably run.”
“ ‘Probably’?”
He shook his head. “I’ll teach you more tomorrow.”

It was late spring, and the days were getting longer. The soldiers began 
refusing to keep their laborers out from dawn till dusk, since that meant 
working from dawn to dusk themselves. In the low-slanting daylight, the 
Ravenessi had found a new diversion: a game called Lupi, wolves. Even 
the people who weren’t playing it watched, cheering and placing bets on 
their favorite players.
My back was healing, but I wasn’t up for playing Lupi yet, so I spent most 
of my time talking to people, learning names and faces and home villages 
and family connections. Michel had taken to his new job of “bodyguard” 
with great enthusiasm, following me everywhere. When I turned and 
glared at him, he would at least fall back a pace or two.
A week or two later, I was talking with an old woman who had lined up for 
morning gruel when I saw a familiar face out of the corner of my eye. I 
whirled—I had seen familiar faces several times, but they had always 
belonged to strangers, rather than my mother or Donato or whomever I

thought it was at first glance. This wasn’t a family member— but it wasn’t a 
stranger, either. She didn’t see me; she was staring off into space, looking 
hungry and lost. “Giula?”
She looked up. “Eliana!” Her face lit up, and she left her place in line to 
run over and give me a hug. I winced as her arms rubbed against my back. 
“Love of the Lady, it’s been how long?”
I calculated. “Six weeks.”
Giula shook her head. “It seems so much longer.”
I nodded. It seemed like months since I had seen Giula. “How long have 
you been in Ravenna?”
“Just a day. My mother and father are here, too, and some of my brothers 
and sisters. I’m so glad to find you here.”
I followed Giula back to the line where her family still waited, Michel 
trailing me. “This is Eliana, one of my friends from the conservatory,” 
Giula said. Her father took my hand gravely and bowed. Her mother was a 
sweet-faced woman with a wary, helpless smile. “These are my parents, 
Lina and Elmo.” I smiled in greeting. “Axe your parents here?” Giula asked.
I lowered my eyes. “They’re dead. My family—they’re all dead.”
“Oh!” Giula covered her mouth. “Oh, I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have asked
—”
“How were you to know?” It had been long enough, now, that I could say it 
without choking back tears. “Once you’ve gotten some food, I’ll introduce 
you to some of my friends here.”
Giula glanced past my shoulder. “Who’s he? Is he your sweetheart?”
I followed her glance to Michel. “Oh—no. Michel is my bodyguard.”

Giula’s eyes went wide. “Your what?”
“It’s a long story,” I said.
Giula’s family was much too large to add to Rafi’s tent, but they had some 
blankets and canvas of their own and Michel and I helped them set up a 
tent on the perimeter near where Rafi lived. “Magery doesn’t work here,” I 
said. “Not even witchlight.” Not entirely true, but if Giovanni couldn’t get a 
witchlight, I was confident Giula wouldn’t be able to.
“Really?” Lina asked, astonished. “Did you hear that, Elmo? Want me to 
show you how to use a flint?” She smiled, oddly pleased. I remembered 
that Giula had told me that her mother couldn’t use magery.
“I’ll just have you light the fire for us,” Elmo said, putting one arm around 
her shoulders in a hug. Watching them, I felt the tears I hadn’t shed earlier 
rising in my throat, and blinked them away.
“Eliana,” Giula said. “What happened to your family?”
“The Circle burned my village,” I said. “Refugees trying to go north had 
gone there, and wouldn’t turn back.”
Giula’s eyes filled with tears. “Why do they hate us so much?”
“They’re afraid,” I said. “They don’t want all those hungry, angry people in 
Cuore.” Lina and Elmo were arranging their tent, so I pulled gently at 
Giula’s sleeve. “Let’s go,” I said. “I want to introduce you to Ran and 
Lucia.”
Giula blushed shyly as I introduced her to Ran, then looked up carefully to 
examine Lucia. “This is Giula,” I said. “She’s a friend of mine from the 
conservatory.”
Lucia scrutinized Giula. “It’s nice to meet you,” she said blandly, squeezing

Giula’s arm. Next to Lucia, Giula’s dimpled prettiness seemed dull and 
sallow; her sweetness seemed weak. Giula could never have survived 
Lucia’s trip from her seminary down to Verdia, even if God had appeared 
to personally tell her that she should go.
Under Lucia’s stare, Giula gulped anxiously and turned back toward me. 
“Is Lucia a musician?” she asked, flinching a little from my own appraising 
look.
“No,” I said. “She’s a dancer, though, and knows a lot of Old Way music.” 
Lucia nodded, trying to catch Giula’s eye again. “She’s taught me some 
new songs.”
“Oh!” Giula said, and glanced nervously at Ran.
“Don’t worry,” I said. “The Fedeli don’t come here.”
Giula smiled again, but didn’t look entirely convinced. I started wondering 
if I should have given her a few days to get her bearings before introducing 
her to my new friends.
Then Giovanni ducked into the tent, and Giula froze, her hand closing on 
my wrist. “What’s be doing here?” she said, shrinking back against me.
“He won’t hurt you,” I said. “Don’t worry, Giula.” The inn in Pluma where 
Giovanni had slapped Giula seemed like a lifetime ago, but I could 
understand why Giula was upset. I stroked her shoulder, trying to reassure 
her.
“Is he one of your friends?” she asked.
“No, not exactly.”
“I think I’d better go,” she whimpered and stood up. I followed her out of 
the tent. She walked rapidly back across Ravenna. I ran after her,

squinting in the bright sunlight. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see 
Michel, but he was keeping his distance.
“Giula—” I said.
“I understand you wanted me to meet your friends,” she said, turning back 
toward me. “But I really don’t understand why you have anything to do 
with him!”
“He’s Lucia’s cousin,” I said. “No one really likes him, Giula, honest!”
Giula shook her head. “Maybe I’ll like your friends more later,” she said, 
and went in to her family’s tent.
At a loss for what to say, I went back to Rafi’s tent. “Fragile flower,” 
Giovanni whispered as I came in, just loudly enough for me to hear.
“Giula seems nice,” Lucia said, but looked troubled.
“What?” I asked.
“She’s not one of us, is she?” Lucia meant that Giula was not Redentore.
“She played the music,” I said defensively. “I don’t think she’s been sealed, 
but it was only by chance that I was.”
“Nothing happens by chance,” Lucia said, then bit her lip. “It’s just—well, 
never mind. We’ll see once she’s settled in.”
I shook my head. “I guess.”
That night, listening to Lucia’s even breathing in the darkness of Rafi’s 
tent, I found my thoughts drifting from Giula to Mira. If we had left the 
conservatory together that spring afternoon when she suggested it, we 
would still have found my village devastated when we arrived. We might 
have come to Ravenna together just as I came to Ravenna alone. What 
would Lucia have thought of Mira, I wondered? She certainly wasn’t

anyone’s fragile flower. I rolled over, trying not to disturb anyone with my 
restlessness. It hurt too much to think about Mira.
I saw Giula only in passing the following day; she chatted with me, but 
made a hasty excuse to leave when Lucia joined me a moment later. Mario 
caught up with me that afternoon, and I agreed to meet some soldiers on 
the hillside to play that evening. I made one request: that at least for this 
first time, Mario bring soldiers like himself—men who hated what they 
were doing here; who knew, when they admitted it to themselves, that it 
was wrong.
My impromptu concerts had generally had a fairly good turnout, but that 
evening the Ravenessi avoided that corner of the valley, giving the 
gathering of soldiers a wide berth. Mario set up some torches so that the 
soldiers would be able to see me play, and the soldiers sat down on the 
hillside.
I played them some folk songs, then a solo piece I’d learned at the 
conservatory. “I need to rest for a minute,” I said after that. “Tell me your 
names, and where you’re from. I want to know who I’m playing for.”
Mario passed a lantern around the circle, so that I could see the faces. I 
already knew a few soldiers here—Mario and Tomas—and I did my best to 
remember each name and each face. Many of the soldiers were from 
Verdia, although most of them were from parts that were well north of the 
wasteland. I asked them if they were worried about their families, and they 
nodded. Even the messenger service didn’t like coming down to Ravenna; 
letters arrived four times a year, with the grain shipments. A few other 
soldiers were from Marino, and the rest from the more northerly 
provinces, near Cuore or Varena.

“Any requests?” I asked when the conversation paused.
“Something old,” one of the soldiers said.
I nodded. I’d only practiced this one briefly, but the tune was simple and I 
really liked it. “The Dance That Turned the Storm,” Lucia had called it. I 
sang the lyrics softly as I played. Rachamin, Arka. Rachamin, Gèsu. 
Rachamin, Arka, step-turn-step. Rachamin, Gèsu, step-turn-step. The 
soldiers didn’t dance, but many closed their eyes, and I could see them 
whispering the words as I played.
“Lucia calls that the Dance That Turned the Storm,” I said when I had 
finished. I lowered my violin. It was time to start talking; this was why I’d 
agreed to play, after all. I walked toward the soldiers, trying to make eye 
contact with as many as I could.
“I know that all of you are soldiers who serve justice,” I said. “I know that 
each of you is a man with a conscience, and that you all have stronger, 
clearer souls than some of the others here. You don’t glory in violence; you 
don’t offer to deal pain. You are men. Not Maledori.” I looked slowly 
around the dark circle, struggling to make out faces. They were nodding; 
some of them looked stricken, others relieved.
“None of you chose to be here, did you? And it’s easy to start feeling alone. 
You’re not alone. I just played the Dance That Turned the Storm. If you 
join together, you can turn any storm that comes against you.” Everyone 
was nodding, now. “I want you to promise yourselves not to be afraid to 
do what’s right. You know in your heart what the right thing is. And it 
doesn’t matter whether you worship Gèsu or the Lady. They both say the 
same thing about slavery.” I wasn’t sure what Gèsu had to say about 
slavery, come to think of it, but as far as I could tell, the Redentori other

than Lucia didn’t know that much about what Gèsu said about anything.
“I want to teach you the dance I just played for you. Stand up and form a 
circle. It’s not hard; Lucia taught it to me and even I could do it.”
They were awkward and self-conscious for a minute or two, but as I picked 
up the pace I could see them smiling. The energy of the dance hummed in 
my ears like the strings of my violin, lighting the landscape around me like 
moonlight. I found myself dancing along with them, facing them as I 
skipped around the circle while I played. I ended the song, finally, and 
pulled the energy around me gently, down into the earth under my feet. 
The hum quieted. I was tired, but oddly warmed. The soldiers sat back 
down for a few more songs, and then I pleaded exhaustion. Mario passed a 
hat for me again; the haul was less impressive this time, but it would help 
feed the Lupi players who practiced instead of working on the wall. I went 
back to Raft’s tent and was asleep before I’d pulled my cloak over me.
* * *
“So have you figured out yet how you’re going to feed your army?” Rafi 
asked. It was a warm day, but with a stiff breeze, and we sat outside Rafi’s 
tent, watching a group of children playing Lupi. “I hope you’re not 
planning to send those youngsters up against the soldiers.”
“No,” I said. “I’ve thought of what to do with the children.” Rafi looked up 
with interest. “My village was not in the wasteland—it came through the 
war with Vesuvia unscathed. The Circle destroyed Doratura.” I sighed into 
the breeze, closing my eyes for a moment. “The thing is, based on what the 
woman in the next village told me, the Doraturiani must have finished 
some of the spring planting before the village was destroyed. And the 
plants wouldn’t have come up yet when the fields were burned—in other

words, there are fields of food that are probably still there.”
“But if no one has been tending them—”
“There won’t be a lot. But there’s not a lot here, either.”
“It’s in ruins, though?”
“Yes. We would have to rebuild.”
“Weren’t there a few survivors from your village? What will they think of 
Ravenessi coming to live with them?”
“I doubt any of them went back,” I said, thinking of my night in the rubble 
of my parents’ house. “If they did . . . well, I don’t think they’ll mind living 
neighbors displacing the ghosts.”
Rafi digested this for a few minutes. “The neighboring village,” he said. 
“Won’t they have taken over the fields by now?”
I shook my head. “I doubt it,” I said. “They were ashamed, of what they 
had done—and the bodies lay in the open. I don’t think they could face the 
consequences of their own cowardice yet.”
“And if you’re wrong?”
I looked down to see that my hands had clenched into fists over the ends of 
my sash. “Then we take it from them. They stood by while my family died. 
They turned me away from their door.” My voice shook, and I looked up to 
see my anger reflected in Rafi’s eyes. “But, once we break out—the 
children, the elderly, anyone who doesn’t want to fight, they can go to 
Doratura. Plant what they can and harvest as much as possible.”
Rafi nodded.
“As for provisioning the army,” I said. “I saw a paper of calculations on 
Teleso’s desk, back when he was keeping me in his guest room. I think that

additional grain should be arriving soon. If we break out right after 
provisions arrive, we can take those provisions with us. Without the 
soldiers, the noncombatants, and those who will die in the fighting, those 
food stores will last a long time.”
Rafi nodded. “So is that what you’re waiting for?”
“Yes.”
“Sounds like you’ve thought of everything.”
The children who were playing nearby were finishing their game. The 
“shepherd” had just won and they were picking teams for the next game. 
“Not even close,” I said softly.
I excused myself sometime later, to go to the latrine. Trenches had been 
dug along the base of the south hill; a rough wall of half-rotted boards had 
been staked up to provide at least a token of privacy, although the soldiers 
on guard duty could easily stare down at anyone relieving themselves. The 
more modest relieved themselves only at night, but I didn’t care enough to 
worry about it. Michel, as my bodyguard, escorted me to the area, but let 
me duck behind the wall to relieve myself without his company.
The smell near the trench was terrible, especially in the heat of the day; the 
people who lived near it were the weakest and most destitute in Ravenna. 
The slum within a slum; most lacked even a makeshift tent, sleeping in the 
open and marking off territory by carving lines in the dust. I was stepping 
out to head back to Rafi’s tent when I caught a glimpse of Lucia, kneeling 
in the dust by a small bundle. She glanced up briefly, and I quickly ducked 
back behind the latrine wall. She looked back down.
“Rachamin, Arka,” she chanted. “Rachamin, Gèsu.”
There was another woman kneeling beside her, staring down anxiously. I

realized that what I had taken for a bundle of rags was a child, wrapped in 
blankets. A man stood nearby, staring at Lucia angrily.
“Good day, Lucia,” another woman said as she approached.
“Good day, Margherita,” Lucia said, and I peered around the wall again, 
shocked. Margherita was the closest approximation to Ravenna’s High 
Priestess of the Lady. “I’ll be done soon,” Lucia added, and Margherita sat 
down on the other side of the child. The woman who knelt beside Lucia 
gave Margherita a hostile glare.
Lucia took out a small vial from under her dress, dabbed the contents onto 
her finger and traced a cross on the child’s head. “Vinni, son of Ottone and 
Elettra,” she said, and then continued in the Old Tongue, alternating 
between spoken and chanted words. When she had finished, she clasped 
the hand of the woman beside her—Elettra, presumably—and they briefly 
bowed their heads in silent prayer, eyes closed.
“Your turn,” Lucia said, and backed off as Margherita pulled out her small 
pouch of dried crushed flowers. The man who had been glaring at Lucia 
knelt eagerly now, and assisted the priestess with the church healing rite. I 
was struck by the similarities of the rituals. Someone somewhere had -
done a lot of rather obvious borrowing. Lucia looked on, patting Elettra’s 
hand and whispering to her.
Margherita and Ottone prayed silently for a minute, just as Lucia and 
Elettra had. When Margherita was done, she and Lucia both stood up to 
go, promising to speak to one of the local healers. Margherita headed back 
toward the main camp, but Lucia paused by the edge of the latrine curtain.
“You can come out now, Eliana,” she said.

I stepped out. “Sorry.”
“No need to apologize,” she said, but her face showed hurt. I didn’t know 
what to say—I’m sorry, Lucia, I just don’t believe? I still don’t understand 
what the rules are for this faith of yours? Maybe somebody drew a cross on 
my head with water, but they didn’t draw it on my heart?—so I jerked my 
shoulder in a shamed shrug, and lowered my eyes.
Lucia turned her head to look at me and gave me one of her quirky smiles. 
“It’s probably just as well you stayed in hiding. If you’d come out to help 
pray, poor Ottone’s heart would probably have burst with fury.”
“So the child who was ill—”
“Has a Redentore mother and a Delia Chiesa father.”
“Delia Chiesa.” Of the church. I hadn’t heard the expression before.
“And Elettra just about had a fit at the thought of Margherita praying to 
the Lady over the boy. Fortunately,” she shrugged, “Margherita and I are 
both sensible enough to recognize that a useless prayer to a nonexistent 
deity won’t do any harm. I humor her, and she humors me.” Lucia sighed 
and brushed off her dress where she’d knelt in the dust, then tucked the 
tiny vial back into her dress. “Let’s go back to Rafi’s tent.”
“What about the healer?”
“Petro won’t go to them on my instructions. I have to ask Rafi, and he has 
to ask Isabella, and she has to send Petro. Nothing’s ever simple.”
“Do you think Petro would go on my instructions?” I asked.
She grinned. “No. But you could go straight to Isabella.” Her smile faded. 
“I doubt there’s much that Petro will be able to do for the boy.”
Isabella agreed, on my request, to send Petro. She seemed pleased that I

had asked; I could almost see a balance sheet of favors being tallied in her 
head. Afterward, Lucia suggested that we go to one of the hills to sit. “I’m 
tired,” she said. “I want to go somewhere quiet.”
Nowhere in Ravenna was exactly quiet, but the hills near the guard posts 
were less crowded. We picked an area patrolled by someone friendly and 
sat down. Michel was going to sit down beside us, but Lucia gave him a 
threatening stare, and he moved off along the hill to a spot where he could 
see us but couldn’t overhear our conversation.
“Do you know about Tomas, Eliana?” Lucia asked after a while.
“You mean the soldier?”
“No, not the soldier. Tomas the Doubter.” I looked at her blankly and she 
sighed. “Your education has been sadly lacking. Do you at least know of 
the Sacrifice and Resurrection? Oh, good God.” It was a prayer, eyes rolled 
heavenward for strength. “You know of Gèsu, at least.” I nodded 
vigorously and she sighed and began her story. “This is not the first 
terrible famine ...”
* * *
Centuries ago, the land was shattered and wasted, and it seemed that 
perhaps all of humanity would die. Our only hope lay in God’s mercy, but 
She turned Her back on us in anger. The world was Her child, but we had 
caused Her too much pain, and She had shut away the love She had once 
felt for us.
Aral Refuah, the Archangel Rafael, pleaded with Her to heal the world. 
Aral Din, the Archangel Michel, urged Her to give us one more chance—to 
devise a test for humanity, and if we passed the test, to spare us. Only Aral 
Mot, the Archangel Lucio, urged Her to let us die; we had brought this

destruction upon ourselves, he pointed out, and deserved no mercy.
God listened to Her advisors, but then turned away from them, and spoke: 
I will turn no more toward the world.
There is one more archangel, Aral Chedvah, the Archangel Gabriele. 
Gabriele also believed that humanity should be saved, but he knew that 
God would not save us unless She could be moved to love us again. 
Gabriele stole a fragment of God’s holy Light, and placed it in the womb of 
a pure young woman. And so she conceived a child, a son, and she named 
him Gèsu.
Gèsu was human, like us, but he carried the Light of God in his soul, and it 
would not let him rest—and so he began his journey. He became a teacher 
and a prophet, and many began to follow him, because they sensed the 
Light within his soul, and even when they did not understand his words, 
they longed for the Light of God. Because Gèsu was human, he loved his 
friends; because he had not God’s bitter anger, he loved the world and all 
humanity. And his Light grew ever brighter.
But there was one, called Giudas, who came to fear the Light; and so he 
betrayed Gèsu, going to the soldiers of the Empire and saying that Gèsu 
was going to lead an uprising against them. Soldiers came to arrest Gèsu, 
but two of his friends—Tomas and Mara—stood by him and spirited him 
away to a hidden cave. The soldiers knew that they would never find him 
by looking, so they took Giudas prisoner, and said that if Gèsu did not turn 
himself in, they would kill Giudas.
Despite Giudas’s betrayal, Gèsu loved him; when he heard this, he could 
not leave Giudas to die in his place. Tomas and Mara begged him not to go, 
but he kissed them and said, “I will be ever with you.”

The Empire crucified Gèsu, spilling his blood onto the broken earth, and 
buried his body in the sand.
When Gèsu died, the Light in his soul returned to God, and suddenly She 
felt the love he had felt for the world, a love so complete that he had 
willingly died for a traitor. God wept, and spoke to Her Angels, saying The 
world is My child; I will not let humanity die.
So God resurrected Gèsu and said, Through your blood shall the world be 
redeemed. Where his blood had fallen, flowers bloomed, and the wood of 
the cross burst into leaf.
And so Gèsu returned, and clasped hands with his followers to dance with 
them. Then he poured them wine. “This is my blood,” he said. “Share it 
among you, and redeem the earth.” He broke bread with them and said, 
“This is my body, which was broken for you and for all the world. Eat, and 
live forever.” Then he danced with them again and said, “Thus does God 
pour out Her Light upon us. So long as the children of Her Light sing and 
dance on the earth, God will never turn from us again.”

Lucia was silent for a long time after she finished the story. Finally I asked, 
“Why is Tomas called the Doubter?”
Lucia sat up again and laughed. “I almost forgot why I was telling you the 
story. When God returned Gèsu to the earth, he went first to Mara, and 
sent her to tell his other followers. But Tomas didn’t believe her. ‘Not until 
I touch his foot and feel the warmth of life, and touch his hand and feel it 
clasp mine, will I believe.’ When Gèsu came to them all the next day, he 
said to Tomas, ‘Reach out your hand and touch my foot. Let me clasp your 
hand. Now, will you believe?’ ” Lucia fell silent again for a bit. “I’ve

touched His feet,” she said. “I’ve reached out and felt His hand grasp mine. 
But I don’t know how to make someone else trust in something they can’t 
see. Not even you, Eliana.”
That night, I waited until Michel fell asleep and then went for a walk alone 
along the hillside. The moon was nearly full and I could pick my way 
easily. I could admit it; I had never trusted in things I couldn’t see. Lucia, 
on the other hand ... I found myself envious of her belief, even as I feared 
it. She was Fedele, faithful, in her own way. I could see her eyes, as I stared 
into the darkness, steady with her absolute conviction, lit with her inner 
light.
“There are some things that are never meaningless,” she had said. “God’s 
love is one.” Nights were cold in the wasteland; I clasped my arms around 
myself as I walked, trying to keep warm. There was something that I felt 
when I played the music that I could not explain. But I had had no grand 
visions like Lucia’s, and the bread Lucia put into my mouth during Mass 
just tasted like bread. What was I supposed to see? What was I supposed 
to feel? Church had always left me cold, but you weren’t expected to love 
the Lady with Lucia’s brand of fervent love—just to pray to her and obey 
her.
Sweet and gentle Lady—the words of the prayer my mother taught me 
when I was just learning to speak fell from my lips before I thought about 
it.

Hold me in your arms tonight 
I know that you are there.
 
 
I had said that prayer before bed each night until my fourth year at the 
conservatory, but the arms I had ached for—then as now—were my 
mother’s.
 
 
You keep us from the Maledori 
You guard the way to wrong 
Sweet and gentle Lady 
I’ll love you my whole life long.
 
 
The prayer didn’t quite scan, I noticed suddenly, and wondered what sorts 
of prayers Lucia would teach her children to say before going to bed. 
Something in the Old Tongue, probably. B’shem Arka, v’barah, v’nehora 
kadosha. That sort of thing.
“All right, God,” I said aloud. “I’ll make the same bargain with you that 
Rafi and Isabella and Giovanni and Lucia made with me. I’ll follow you as 
long as you’re leading somewhere I want to be going.” I knelt to touch the 
ground, then crossed myself. Looking up at the stars, I took out Bella’s 
cross, and kissed it. “I’m one of Yours now.”

I told myself that I believed. But perhaps it was just that I saw the Light in

Back at the conservatory, we always played a con-cert for the village 
during the Dono alia Magia festival. Aside from the hours and weeks of 
rehearsals, though, I participated little in the preparations. One day it 
would be late spring, and then the next day the conservatory would be 
decked with lights and the conductors would be shouting at the strings to 
pick up the pace, there was only a week left.
Festival preparations at Ravenna were subtle, but visible. People couldn’t 
really dress up, but they washed their clothes. Some even washed their 
tents; Ravenna was suddenly more colorful. Tallow became an extremely 
valuable commodity, and lamp oil even more so. “I didn’t even know there 
were this many Delle Chiese in Ravenna. I thought most of Ravenna 
followed the Old Way,” I said to Lucia, as we watched an old woman

named Betira making candles.
Lucia sighed. “Many,” she said, “but not most. There were Delle Chiese 
that attended the funeral . . . just as there are Redentori who will attend 
the Dono alia Magia festivities.”
“Does that bother you?”
“Maybe. But it’s pointless to fight against it.” She shrugged. “They’ll repent 
next week.” We were silent for a bit. “Are you playing for the soldiers again 
tonight?”
“Yes.”
“How much longer do you think you’ll be able to keep it up, before Teleso 
starts getting antsy?”
“I don’t know,” I said. Discreetly, I eased my collar away from my throat. 
“Mario will warn me. I hope.”
My concerts for the soldiers had become a twice-weekly event, once for the 
night shift and once for the day shift. More and more soldiers attended 
each time. That night I played for the day shift; Mario and Tomas were 
there, studying me from the darkness.
“You’re not alone,” I repeated. “It’s Teleso who is alone. We have each 
other. You have each other. Together, you can turn any storm that Teleso 
can raise. We can turn the storm.”
The regulars were already starting to form a circle, clasping the hands of 
the newcomers. Some of the newcomers looked nervous—others, relieved.
“You have the strength to do what you know in your heart is right,” I said. 
“You have all the strength you need.”
As they stood in the circle, I played the first notes of the dance, and they

started, the regulars leading the newcomers through the steps. As always, I 
felt the energy building, tonight like a light that jumped from hand to hand 
through the circle. When the dance finished, I pulled the energy down into 
the earth. Later, as the soldiers dispersed, Mario approached me. “Arianna
—Teleso’s maid—says she wishes she could hear you again,” he said.
“Does she ever get to leave the keep?” I asked.
“No,” Mario said.
“If she can tell me the next time Teleso gets drunk,” I said, “I can stand 
under one of the windows to play.”
Mario liked that idea. “That should be soon,” he said. “Teleso gets drunk 
pretty often.”
“So let me know next time, and I’ll come play.”
He hesitated a moment longer. “The girl Giula. The other violinist. Is she a 
friend of yours?”
“Yes,” I said. “We went to the same conservatory. Why?”
“You should know, then,” he said. “She’s been keeping company with 
Teleso.”
“Keeping company,” I said. “What do you mean, ‘keeping company’?”
Mario opened his mouth, then closed it and shook his head. “Look for her 
in the piazza tomorrow,” he said. “You’ll see what I mean.”
The next morning, I took a walk in the piazza when I had finished my 
gruel. I didn’t see Giula anywhere, and for a moment I thought that 
perhaps Mario had her confused with someone else. Then the front door of 
the keep opened— the door only Teleso used.
Giula was clean, and she had ribbons in her hair. She clasped her hands

around Teleso’s arm, tucking herself into his side as they walked. She saw 
me from across the piazza; her eyes narrowed briefly in a malicious glare, 
then she turned away, tugging Teleso gently in the other direction.
Michel edged up toward me. “I still don’t think this is such a good idea, 
Eliana,” he said.
“Shh,” I said. “Back off.”
Teleso glanced idly toward us; his face brightened slightly when he spotted 
me. He bent his head to whisper in Giula’s ear, then drew her across the 
piazza toward me.
Michel started edging up again and I stepped away from him, toward Giula 
and Teleso.
“Good afternoon, Eliana,” Teleso said. His smile was broad; he nudged 
Giula forward, like a peddler displaying his best wares. “Giula tells me 
you’re old friends.”
“Yes,” I said, looking at Giula. She met my eyes with a look of challenge 
that baffled me. “Hello, Giula.”
“Hello,” Giula said. “What are you bothering with me for? Where are your 
new friends?”
“I wanted to see you,” I said. “It’s been too long.”
“It has,” she said. “So why now, then? Are you jealous?” Again she shot me 
a look of challenge, then softened into a dimpled smile to look up at 
Teleso. Teleso gave her a perfunctory smile, then looked back at me.
“Jealous?” Jealous? “Why on earth would I be jealous?” Just as long as it’s 
not me. I met Teleso’s eyes evenly. “I’m delighted that you’re happy, Giula. 
I’m sure Teleso is taking good care of you.”

Giula glanced from me to Teleso, then huddled close to him again. “He 
told me what you did,” she said. Her lip was trembling.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” I said. “It wasn’t what I did, it was what I 
refused to—”
“He said you tried to start a riot,” she said. “At Beneto and Jesca’s funeral.”
My head snapped up, and Teleso met my eyes with a smirk. I bit back the 
urge to call him a liar right then and there—that seemed unnecessarily 
risky. “That’s an interesting way of describing what happened,” I said. 
“You might try asking a few other people for their version.” Out of the 
corner of my eye, I could see Michel edging toward me again.
“Why should I?” she said. “Are you saying Teleso would lie to me?”
“Giula!” I said. Again, I glanced at Teleso, wondering if there were some 
way I might get her alone, but he had a tight grip on her. “We’ve known 
each other for five years. Do you think I’d start a riot?”
“Well,” she said, tossing her ribbons and curls back over her shoulder. “I 
used to know you. But that was before your best friend was a boy who 
beats up girls he’s never met before.”
“He’s not my best friend!” I said. “I can’t stand Giovanni. Everyone else in 
Ravenna knows that, I can’t understand how you managed to miss it—”
“Right,” she said mockingly. “Sweet little stupid Giula. Don’t worry about 
telling her; if she’s too much of a fool to figure it out, who cares?”
I backed up a step, stunned by her fury, and nearly stepped on Michel’s 
foot. “Why are you angry at me?” I said. I realized that I was close to tears. 
“Giula, we’re friends.”
“We were friends,” she said. Her eyes narrowed, and her lips pressed

together into a painted pout. Then she turned back to Teleso, all simpering 
dimples again. “Did you have anything else to say to Eliana, darling?” she 
asked him.
Teleso was still staring at me, looking disappointed. Giula tugged on his 
sleeve and he looked down at her. “No, sweetness,” he said. “Let’s go back 
in. I’ve had enough sun for today.”
Giula gave me a final nod, and then turned away to sweep back across the 
piazza and into the keep.
* * *
I didn’t want to go back to Rafi’s tent, after that—I wanted to be alone, 
which was impossible in Ravenna, but if I walked along the edge of the 
valley, maybe no one would bother me. Maybe I could persuade Michel to 
keep his distance. Maybe.
“ Generate.”
“I really need to be alone, please,” I said.
“Generale!” The voice was insistent, and I turned; it was Amedeo.
“Leave me alone, crazy man,” I said.
“Leave her alone,” Amedeo said. “She’s already got one foot in the fire and 
she put it there herself.”
“Giula?” I asked.
Amedeo spat onto the ground. “She’s as good as dead,” he said. “ Let her 
go. You’ve got more important people to worry about. Shake her dust from 
your feet.”
I started to turn away, but he grabbed my wrist with his bony hand.
“Besides,” he said. “We’ve still got each other!” He kissed my hand and

leered at me.
I snatched my hand away. “Leave me alone!” Michel started toward us, 
then backed off.
“Oh,” Amedeo said, disappointed. “Scorned again! You prefer Mario, is 
that it? Or is it Lucia?” He smirked at me. “Bad luck there. Something the 
Redentori are going to have in common with the Lady—they won’t like 
that sort of thing. Two girls, two boys, you know. Like witchlight.” He held 
out his hand and a glow sprang into it. “It’s a sin.” He stared at the light in 
his hand as if it were a snake, screeched once, and put it out, shaking his 
hand as if he had touched something nasty.
I stared at him. “Do you have anything sensible to say to me, old man? Or 
are you just raving again?”
“God bless you,” Amedeo said, and went off back down into the valley, 
humming to himself.
Prefer Lucia? I sat down on the hill, staring down into Ravenna. Two girls? 
I wasn’t sure what Amedeo meant, what the Redentori were forbidding. I 
clasped my arms around my knees. Ten paces away, Michel stood idly, 
glancing around every few seconds to make sure nobody was getting into 
position to take a shot at me. I closed my eyes, trying to block out Michel, 
Ravenna, everything.
I’ve reached out and felt His hand grasp mine, I could hear Lucia’s voice 
saying. What was it that made Lucia seem to exude light? There are some 
things that are never meaningless. I thought of her face, brown from the 
sun and the wind, her hair bleached to straw. I wanted to dance with her, I 
realized. I wanted to do more than dance with her.
I opened my eyes and stood up, starting to walk again, remembering the

feeling of Lucia’s hand in mine. I wanted to touch her face; I wanted to feel 
her skin, softer than the velvet dress. I wanted to touch her hair, 
windblown and tangled, to run my hands through it.
My hands were shaking, and I wrenched my thoughts back to Ravenna, the 
reform movement, Michel’s patient step behind me. I stopped walking and 
closed my eyes again, trying desperately to focus. But instead of Ravenna, 
the image that flashed through my mind was Mira—Mira, by the 
conservatory wall, clasping my hand and looking into my eyes, giving me 
the smile that warmed me to the soles of my feet. Only this time her smile 
was knowing, and she took my hand tight enough to make me wince.
I opened my eyes again. Was that supposed to be against God’s will, like 
witchlight? I didn’t want to know. Walking quickly, like I could leave 
behind whatever part of myself Amedeo had seen, I headed back to Rafi’s 
tent.
I saw Giula the next day, from a distance. I was crossing the piazza when 
she came out for a walk, simpering on Teleso’s arm. They were inspecting 
the preparations for Dono alia Magia. I recognized the dress she wore; it 
was the wine-red velvet dress Teleso had tried to persuade me to put on. 
As I watched her, she looked over her shoulder and our eyes met. I could 
see her eyes flicking over me, looking me up and down, taking in my 
shabby clothes and dirty face. She had a little smirk on her face, and I 
knew what she was thinking. Look at her. I am so fortunate, and she is so 
foolish, to turn her back on all that I have gained. With a toss of her 
smooth-brushed hair, she turned back toward Teleso, who smiled down at 
her with pride in his most attractive possession.
I was going to be sick if I watched this much longer, so I strode off toward

Isabella’s tent and didn’t look back.
A few nights later, Mario sent word for me to meet him on the hillside, a 
few hours after his shift ended. “The grain arrived,” he said. “Late last 
night.”
“I can move soon, then,” I said.
“You can move now, and you should. You’re going to be in serious trouble 
soon, Eliana.”
“I’m going to wait until after Dono alia Magia,” I said. “That’s only another 
three days.”
Mario shook his head impatiently. “There is exactly one thing that has kept 
Teleso from stringing you up like Jesca, and that’s your old buddy, Giula. 
She’s kept him distracted. She’s done more for you than anyone else here— 
remember that when she’s cringing at your feet.”
“What do you mean?”
“When you’ve led the uprising. When you’ve led the breakout.” Mario’s 
face was stormy and I avoided his eyes. “That is what you’re planning, isn’t 
it?” he asked. I hesitated for a moment, and his voice grew impatient. “It’s 
a bit late to decide you don’t trust me. Those soldiers you’ve been lecturing 
on morality—are you going to lead us against our fellows? Against Teleso?”
“I’d sort of planned to play it by ear,” I said. I’d mainly been hoping the 
soldiers would stay out of the way when the uprising came—just stand 
back and not try to kill us— and that no one would try to kill them. 
“Leading you against your commander—” I shook my head.
“You could, you know.” Mario gripped my arm. “We’d follow you.”
“ ‘We’? Who are you speaking for, Mario? Not all the men who come to my

concerts.”
“No,” he said. “But many of them.”
“You hate Teleso that much? And the Circle?”
“We’ve been abandoned here,” Mario said. “Just as you have. All I ask—” 
He paused. “All I ask is that you invite my men to join you when you lead 
your insurrection. Ask us to join you. Don’t just turn your people against 
us.”
“I don’t turn away allies,” I said.
“We can be of use to you. I can get you into the keep, once you’ve started 
your uprising.”
“How?” I asked.
“A soldier named Bassio.” I recognized the name; Bassio had recently 
started coming to my concerts. He was a tall, quiet man, and the other 
soldiers had been surprised to see him. I hoped Teleso would be similarly 
surprised. “Tell me when you’re ready, and he’ll get into position,” Mario 
said. “He’ll open the door to the keep.”
“That’s good to know,” I said.
Mario nodded, and turned away to go, then turned back. “Remember what 
I said about Giula,” he said, and strode quickly away.
* * *
Dono alia Magia preparations continued, and Margherita led nightly 
prayer services. I knew that there were nightly prayer services in the 
barracks, but Mario came each night to pray with the Delia Chiese 
prisoners, taking off his sword and kneeling in the dust. Teleso, too, saw 
Mario at prayer, and I could see his eyes glint with anger and a hint of

satisfaction. He strolled the piazza with Giula regularly; I could see his 
eyes sweeping the crowd looking for me, so I stayed out of his sight as well 
as I could.
The popularity of the game, Lupi, continued to rise. Permanent teams had 
formed, and the people who weren’t playing the game were betting on the 
outcomes. Even Mario didn’t seem to suspect; it had worked perfectly.
There was another strange thing I’d noticed recently. Red sashes had 
become the fashion among Lupi players. I had no idea where all the red 
blankets were coming from, but there seemed to be plenty of red sashes to 
go around.

“We shouldn’t go,” Lucia said.
“You don’t have to,” I said. “I can go by myself.” “I don’t understand why 
you won’t just stay here.” “I want to see how they do the Dono alia Magia 
ritual,” I said. “Without magery.”
Giovanni sat beside Lucia, in Rafi’s tent, his eyes flicking from Lucia’s face 
to mine. “I want to go, too,” he said. Great, I thought, just what I need. 
Giovanni as company all evening. “I’m curious, too. I’ve been curious 
about all the Delia Chiese rituals, but you never let me go to any.” This last 
comment became a whine, directed at Lucia. “Fine,” she said. “We’ll all go.”
The ritual was to take place in the piazza. The tents along the edge had 
been taken down again, making the space larger. Unlit torches on high 
stakes ringed the periphery of the piazza, and dried horse dung had been 
heaped in the center for a fire. It was still daylight, and would be daylight 
for a while yet. Margherita was nowhere in sight, but the piazza was 
beginning to fill with the faithful and the onlookers. Some of the old

women had brought drums to beat, and younger people were dancing. Not 
the careful ritual dance of the Old Way, though; they danced with their 
own internal partners, flinging their bodies in wild gyrations. Michel was 
dancing in the piazza; he was as graceful dancing for the Lady as he was 
with the Redentori. He had asked me several days earlier if Lucia and 
Giovanni could protect me for the day, and I had assured him that I would 
be fine.
“Harlots,” Lucia said, her eyes locked onto the dancers.
Giovanni rolled his eyes. “I don’t see any harm in dancing steps that God 
didn’t write out for you,” he said. “I always liked dancing before the Dono 
alia Magia service.” Lucia glared at him, and he stayed where he was.
We spread out our cloaks and sat down on the ground on a slight rise at 
the edge of the expanded piazza. “You should see Dono alia Magia in 
Cuore,” Giovanni said to me. “I thought there were a lot of lights in 
Varena, but it’s nothing compared to Cuore. The Circle participates, of 
course. The whole city is lit up.”
“I can imagine.”
“I doubt it,” Giovanni said.
Petro, passing by, offered us a swig from his clay jug. Lucia shook her head 
primly, but Giovanni took the jug. “You should have some, Lucia,” he 
urged with a smirk, but she shook her head again and he returned the jug 
to Petro with a nod of thanks. “Best wine I’ve had in months,” Giovanni 
said when he’d gone. “Should’ve figured Petro would have a stash.”
“I’m surprised he’s sharing it,” I said, and Giovanni laughed. Lucia glared 
at both of us.

More of the old women arrived, joining the drummers. Some of them 
brought drums, but most just had pots or tin cups to bang together. The 
noise increased and sharpened. I wrinkled my nose. “We had drums at the 
conservatory,” I said. “Just drums.”
“You drive away the Maledori with noise,” Giovanni pointed out. “Any 
noise. We had all sorts of noisemakers in Varena and Cuore.”
“There’s nothing that says it has to be an unpleasant noise,” I said. Most of 
the old women had gotten onto the beat together, but a few were a hair 
behind, creating a clattering cacophony that sounded like a drunk cat in a 
room full of cymbals.
Twilight fell, and the faithful began to leave the piazza. The old women 
stayed, of course, still banging on their pots. Someone—Petro, maybe—was 
starting to light the torches. Giovanni fell silent. “I’ve never watched this 
before,” I said. “I was always one of the Blind, at the conservatory.”
“Figures,” Giovanni said.
“Give me a break, Giovanni. I suppose you were an honorary drummer.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” he said. “Of course I was one of the Blind, too.”
“Yes, you were,” Lucia said softly. She was smiling a little bit when I 
glanced back.
On a signal from someone I hadn’t seen, the drumming became more 
insistent, and more regular. They were almost all on the beat now. I 
remembered this moment, from the conservatory, standing blindfolded in 
the vestry of the church, my hand on Bella’s shoulder and Giula’s hand on 
my shoulder. Straining for the sound of the beat, for the signal that we 
could stop standing around and could wind our way into the church.

Here they came, finally. I’d never realized quite how simultaneously 
frightening and silly we must have looked. At the conservatory, we all had 
matching white blindfolds, but here people made do with what they could 
find. I saw more than a few red sashes used that way. The line was led by 
the priestess, Margherita, whose eyes were covered only with a thin veil 
that she could easily see through. Behind her was Giula, who had claimed 
the place of honor by virtue of her position as Teleso’s lady, and behind 
her, one of the women who lived by the latrines. To be next to Giula was no 
honor. Each person was blindfolded, led by the person in front. The 
faithful wound through Ravenna like an endless blind centipede. When 
they reached the piazza, Margherita began to spiral the line, so that it 
wound tight, packing people in. She signaled, and the drumming stopped. 
Silence was the cue: everyone dropped hands and sat down in the piazza, 
feeling carefully underneath them first. Margherita pulled off her blindfold 
and spoke to the crowd.
“Tonight is the Night of the Gift of the Lady.”
Crash. I jumped at the echoing cymbals.
“Centuries ago, our land was dark with war, ignorance, and superstition. 
The Empire that had kept the peace for a thousand years was crumbling, 
and barbarians invaded from the north. The Maledori nipped at our heels 
and leered at us from the shadows. Our people cried to their god in fear, 
but there was only silence.”
Crash.
“Then on this night, those centuries ago, the Lady came to a man called 
Gaius, shining in the darkness like a star come to earth. ‘Behold,’ She said. 
‘I bring the greatest of gifts.’ ”

“‘Behold,’ ” Lucia muttered beside me, “ ‘I am a stranger among you, yet I 
bring the greatest of gifts.’ The Journey of Gèsu, chapter 1, verse I.”
“So the Lady borrowed,” Giovanni said. “She steals only from the best.”
Margherita continued from the center of the piazza. “Gaius said, ‘What 
have you brought us?’ And the Lady said, ‘Open your eyes, Gaius. Open 
your eyes, and see!”
Crash.
That was the cue for everyone to pull off their blindfold, to see the ring of 
light that surrounded them.
“In Cuore,” Giovanni said, “the Circle created lights in the sky—not 
magefire, it wasn’t dangerous. Just pretty. All colors, too.”
At the conservatory, we were ringed by teachers, each of whom held a 
globe of witchlight. No one held witch-light here in Ravenna, of course. 
Instead, torches flickered brightly in the summer night.
“The Lady’s Gift to Gaius was magery,” Margherita said. “Gaius also 
learned the other things the Lady wanted for Her children—peace, 
prosperity, fertility, abundance, freedom. To provide these things, Gaius 
taught as many people magery as he could, and gathered in those with the 
strongest talent to serve the Emperor and protect the land.”
Giovanni snorted softly behind me. “To take over from the Emperor,” he 
said under his breath. “And divide power with the Fedeli, as poachers 
might divide the spoils from their hunt.”
“Mario is loyal to the Emperor,” I said.
Giovanni shrugged. “What good is the army without the Circle?”
“The Circle united the land, and magery spread,” Margherita said.

“Actually,” Giovanni said, “the Empire fell apart anyway. Magery spread 
all right, and now there are thousands of little Circles out there. Tough to 
control an empire with a handful of mages who don’t want to leave their 
comfortable enclave ...”
“Our people abandoned superstition. The Lady does not ask us to believe 
in things we can only imagine, but gives us light we can see by and faith we 
can touch,” Margherita said. “We can hold the Lady’s Gift in our hands.”
“Not here!” someone shouted. I realized with a lurch that it was Rafi. I 
looked at Lucia, but her eyes were as wide and horrified as mine.
Margherita never missed a beat. “The Lady promised Gaius that She would 
never turn away from us; Her love is perfect, true, and complete. And so, 
Her blessings were passed from Gaius to our grandparents to us. Please 
join with me—” and everyone joined in with her in a long hymn.
Lucia shook her head, not quite able to hide her smile. “You never expect 
Rafi to be the one who makes trouble, you know?”
Giovanni shrugged. “So what did you think?” he asked me.
“It’s strange, with fire instead of witchlight. It looks like we’re saying that 
until the Lady came, we didn’t have fire,” I said.
In the piazza, Margherita lit the bonfire and people tossed in handfuls of 
incense. A wave of rose-scented smoke washed over us.
“I’m going to be ill,” Lucia warned us. “I can’t stand that smell.”
“I’ve seen what I came to see,” I said. “We can go.”
“I’m staying,” Giovanni said. “Next is more dancing. I always liked 
dancing.”
“Harlot,” Lucia said to him.

“I’ll repent tomorrow,” he said with a mocking bow. “Or the day after. 
Tomorrow night is Midsummer’s Eve, isn’t it? And you know what they 
say about Midsummer’s Eve.”
“You’re hopeless,” she said, and turned her back on him. I followed her 
toward the hills.
“What do they say about Midsummer’s Eve?” I asked when we’d gotten a 
ways away.
“Oh, you know,” Lucia said. “Didn’t they say this in your village? Anything 
that happens that night doesn’t ‘count.’ ”
I grinned. “That does sound familiar. People said that sort of thing at the 
conservatory, but you know, if we were caught with a boy it would count 
no matter what night it was.”
“Well, the priests and priestesses at the seminary always said it was 
heresy, but it’s a very popular heresy all over, I think.”
We sat down on the hillside. From here, the torches looked like a ring of 
dancing jewels against the darkness. I sighed.
“You can go dance, too, if you like,” Lucia said. “I won’t hold it against 
you.”
“That’s all right. I’ve never been a very good dancer.”
Lucia leaned against my shoulder. “Lying’s a sin too, you know. You’re a 
fine dancer.”
“How would you know?” I said. “I play, I don’t dance.”
“I know,” Lucia said. She turned her head to look up at me, and give me a 
wry smile. My gaze nearly faltered, but I managed to smile back at her.
Lucia pulled away from me briefly and spread out her cloak; we lay down

on her cloak and covered ourselves with mine, leaning against each other 
to stay warm in the wasteland’s chill night breeze. “Do you ever think 
about your parents, Lucia?” I asked.
“Not very often,” she said. “I haven’t seen them for a long time.”
“Are they alive?”
“As far as I know.” Lucia sighed. “I tried to write to them once, last year. 
Before I came to Ravenna. Apparently, they refused to open my letter. So I 
might just as well be dead, as far as they’re concerned.”
“And Giovanni?”
“I don’t know what his parents think. He was their only son and they 
always let him get away with a lot. Joining a reform movement is probably 
just another little boy’s game, as far as they’re concerned.”
“I don’t know what my parents would have thought,” I said.
“Would you be here, if they were still alive?” Lucia asked.
“No.”
Under the cloak, Lucia’s hand found mine. “Your hands are cold,” she said.
“Sorry,” I said, and my voice trembled slightly.
Lucia turned her face toward mine in the moonlight; she smiled. I pulled 
one hand free of the cloak, and reached to touch her cheek. It was as soft 
as velvet; she closed her eyes briefly at their cold touch.
“Lucia,” I said, and my voice shook. “The last time I saw Amedeo, he said 
something—about women who feel toward women as Giula feels toward 
men.” I wanted to stop, but I had gone too far not to finish asking now. 
“He said that—that it’s one of the things that goes against God. Is it?”
Lucia’s hand tightened gently over mine. “Amedeo is a foolish old man.

Gèsu never said anything one way or the other.”
We lay in silence for a moment, and Lucia brushed my cheek gently. “I am 
not as you are, Eliana. But I don’t believe that God thinks any less of you.”
I was comforted, though I felt an odd wrench at her words, I am not as 
you are. But at least this didn’t fall into the strange category of things that 
the Redentori forbid. As Lucia’s hand fell away from my cheek, though, I 
remembered that Amedeo hadn’t said that the Redentori bad this 
prejudice in common with the followers of the Lady; he had said that they 
would have this in common. Amedeo is a crazy old man, I told myself, my 
hand tightening on Lucia’s. I’ve heard him say nothing that makes sense.
We stared up at the stars for a long time. Then—“Look!” Lucia gasped, and 
I turned my head to see the shooting star.
“Do Redentori wish on shooting stars?” I asked.
“I’ve never heard anyone say we can’t,” she said. “There was an old woman 
in one of the villages I visited before the war—she said that a shooting star 
was the Archangel Michel coming to earth from heaven.”
“Why?”
“I don’t know. So he can lead a battle on God’s side. Michel is Aral Din, the 
Angel of Justice. The patron of those who fight and die for God.”
“Like Beneto,”I said.
“Yes,” she said. “Or like you.”
I didn’t sleep that night.

As the sky lightened to gray, I got up quietly to go to the latrines, covering 
Lucia carefully so as not to wake her. I wished before long that I could

have brought my cloak; I could see the puffs of my breath as steam in the 
air. I didn’t think I was likely to sleep, but by the time I was finished at the 
latrine, I had decided that I was going to go back and lie down next to 
Lucia again, just to get warm.
“Eliana.”
I turned to see Mario, his cloak pulled around his face.
“You’re in danger,” he hissed. “Come on. We need to get you somewhere 
hidden.”
“Isabella’s,” I said.
“No. They’ll look there. Come on.” He had brought an extra cloak, and 
flung it around my shoulders; I pulled the hood over my face. The cloak 
was so long it trailed on the ground, and he hustled me along toward the 
keep. I pulled the wool around me, shivering. I still wanted to be sleeping 
next to Lucia.
“Teleso has ordered your arrest,” he said.
“Lucia—”
“Is not in danger,” he said. “It’s you he wants.”
Mario led me through the back door into the stables. The two young men 
on guard duty there were Tomas and Plautio; they saluted me gravely as 
Mario led me in.
“Do you have a plan, then?” Mario asked. “Or will we need to smuggle you 
out?”
“I’m not leaving,” I said.
“You have a plan, then?”

“Yes.” I closed my eyes for a minute, tipping my head back to rest it 
against the wall of the stable. “I was almost ready to lead the breakout. I 
wanted a few more days— people tend to get drunk during Dono alia 
Magia, if there’s any wine at all to be had. But I could do it now. I just need 
a crowd.”
“There’s a crowd—”
“Not in the piazza. That’s Teleso’s territory and he knows it. North hill. I 
need a crowd on the north hill at dawn.” I opened my eyes again and 
looked Mario in the face. “Tell Michel. He’ll get people there.”
“What then?”
“Then I start the uprising,” I said, and tried to smile.
Tomas and Plautio hid me in the stables as Michel and Mario were sent 
out to gather the Ravenessi to the north hill. All I could do at that point 
was to stay out of sight, so I huddled in a corner behind barrels of grain. 
The grain used for horse feed, I noticed, was better than what was fed to 
the Ravenessi. I wished I had Lucia with me, to keep me from worrying. 
Over and over, in my head, I rehearsed the words I was going to say. At 
one point, one of the horses snorted and stamped its foot, and I started 
with such force that I almost knocked over the barrels I was hidden 
behind. My heart pounded like a drum, and my head throbbed with each 
knock. My hands were shaking.
It’s just one of the horses, I thought, pressing my cold hands against my 
forehead and trying to rub away the pain. Nothing worth getting scared 
over. I realized a moment later that I had thought—for an instant—that the 
noise was someone like Niccolo coming into the stable. You’re going to be 
leaving the stable in a little while, I thought. Facing Teleso and Niccolo

and all the other soldiers who won’t surrender. It’s a bit late to be getting 
scared now.
I tried to focus again on what I would say, but the ache in my head and the 
sickness in my stomach were getting worse. I’m sick, I thought. Lady’s tits, 
I’m getting a fever. I pressed my palm against my forehead, but of course 
to my icy hands, anything would feel hot. I can’t get sick now. I’d let down 
Lucia, Mario, Michel . . . and Giovanni would gloat. That thought made 
me angry, and for a moment, I no longer felt afraid. And Teleso would be 
so pleased that I’d failed. I thought of Teleso laughing, his cold eyes 
brightening, his arm curling around Giula’s waist—
“Eliana.” Mario had come back so quietly that I hadn’t heard him. 
“Everything’s ready.”
I stood up. “Let’s go,” I said.
A handful of the soldiers closed in around me to conceal me as I left the 
stable; when we reached the edge of the crowd at the north hill, I slipped 
out. The crowd parted to make way for me as I strode toward the north 
hill. Some lowered their eyes as I passed; others held out their fists in 
salute. I climbed to the top of the hill, painfully aware of what an easy 
target I made; the crowd fell silent as I turned to them.
“I have no music for you today,” I said. “The dancing that was needed has 
been done.”
Deep in the crowd, I could see Lucia and Giovanni. Lucia’s eyes burned 
with her own light, but Giovanni’s face was lit too—and I realized with 
shock that his eyes burned with faith in me. Suddenly, I was no longer 
afraid. I could face down Teleso. Nothing was going to stop me.
“We have the strength we need,” I said. “We have the will that we need.”

Mario moved along the edge of the crowd, speaking urgently to each 
soldier.
“The Circle killed my family,” I said. “They burned my farm and herded me 
here like a dog. Why? Because they are afraid of us. They are afraid of 
thousands of hungry, angry people, standing outside their gates in Cuore 
and shouting, ‘Why? Why did you fight this war? The Vesuviano army 
could have done nothing worse to us than you have done!’
“They have left us to starve. They want us to die—they want our skeletons 
to lie bleached in the sun like those of our families that they have killed. 
They want us to die quietly. They have treated us like dogs that they can 
shut away or kill at will. But we are not dogs any longer. We are wolves.”
The crowd cried out. “Yes!” I heard someone shout.
“We are the wolves,” I said. “We have learned to hunt as a pack. We have 
learned to bring down the shepherd that would pick us off one by one with 
his crossbow. The sheep Teleso is now our easy prey. And we can turn on 
those who would leave us to starve!”
There was another cry from the crowd.
“Not all the soldiers are our enemies,” I said, and gestured so that people 
turned to face the soldiers that now ringed the edge of the crowd. “We are 
not the only ones who have been abandoned to die. They are prisoners as 
much as we are. Join us!” I shouted to the soldiers. “Cast aside Teleso and 
join us against our enemy. Against your enemy! Once we are dead Teleso 
will have no use for you, either. You are men, not monsters! You are not 
Teleso’s sheep—you are wolves, like us!”
Mario stepped forward, very deliberately. He held up a red sash, like the

Lupi wore, for all to see, then tied it around his waist. Around him, other 
soldiers brought out red sashes and tied them on.
A cheer broke forth from the crowd.
“To the keep,” I shouted. “We will tear down the walls with our anger! We 
will break into the storehouse of food! We will water the hills of Ravenna 
with the blood of our enemies.”
I raised my fist, and the battle cry of the Ravenessi army echoed across the 
valley like a pack of a thousand wolves hunting under the full moon.

As I stood on the hillside, I heard a zip near my ear and heard Giovanni 
shout, “Look out!” Realizing that I was being fired on, I scrambled down 
the slope and into the mass of Ravenessi, and we started to run.
I could see very little from the middle of the crowd; once we were moving, 
I realized that I had no way of communicating with my army, no way to 
direct our actions. To the keep ran through the crowd like spilled water; I 
pushed my way toward the front of the refugee army, trying desperately to 
lead it.

There were so many of us! I could see soldiers scattering like leaves in 
wind. Many of the soldiers had followed Mario’s lead and joined us, their 
insignias ripped from their sleeves, and others threw their crossbows to 
the ground, getting as far out of our way as they could. I saw Isabella hit a 
soldier on the head with a short club, then rip the crossbow from his arms 
and turn it against his fellows.
I heard screams of pain around me as we reached the keep and realized 
that we had been met with a torrent of crossbow bolts. I scanned the side 
of the keep, noticing the tiny narrow windows that provided just enough 
space for the bowmen to pick us off. Some of my men were trying to batter 
down the door. Where was Mario’s friend Bassio? I scanned the keep and 
with a sickening lurch of my stomach realized that his body swung from a 
rope out of one of the upper-story windows of the keep. “Oh no,” I 
whispered.
Another curtain of bolts fell on us and people scattered. Someone jerked 
on my arm—Giovanni. “Cover!” he shouted. “You idiot! We need to get 
under cover— don’t you realize they’re aiming for you?”
I let Giovanni drag me toward one of the residual walls at the edge of the 
piazza. “What now?” he asked.
“The soldier swinging by his neck was going to let us in,” I said.
Giovanni looked over the wall and quickly ducked back down. “Do you 
have a backup plan?” he asked.
“Got any suggestions?”
“Well, now is just a grand time to ask, Generale. You sure let us think you 
had everything under control.”
“Well, if you don’t, then—”

“We could leave,” he said. “Retreat now. The soldiers are in the keep; 
they’ll have to come out to follow us. We could get a head start—”
“We need the grain,” I said. “We need it. Or this is all for nothing—we’ll 
just starve even faster. Unless you had some ideas about how to feed our 
army.”
“You never asked,” he said.
“Well, do you?”
“No. Maybe if you’d asked earlier I’d have thought of something.”
Most of our army had found some cover by now, and we stared across the 
piazza. “Stalemate,” Giovanni said.
“Generate!”
I looked behind me as Mario ran up. “I can get us inside,” he said 
breathlessly.
“Bassio is dead,” I said.
Mario’s jaw tightened. “I know,” he said. “But I have another way. Through 
the south door. Get some people together to give us cover; the soldiers in 
the keep will fire as soon as we’re out in the open.”
I looked around, at a loss. The Lupi weren’t going to want to leave cover. 
Maybe if I left it first... I leapt up onto the wall I’d been hiding behind. 
“Follow me!” I shouted, and a new cheer went up from our army.
“What the hell,” Giovanni sputtered, but fortunately the crowd surged 
around me again and we ran through the rain of bolts.
The south door Mario had referred to was near the back of the keep, the 
smallest and grimiest entrance. We pushed and the door opened easily.

“How?” I asked as Mario passed me.
“Arianna,” he said. “She said she’d leave it open for us if she could.”
“I owe you,” I said.
“No,” he said. “You owe her.”
Our army surged into the keep. This was better; Teleso’s men would lose 
some of the advantages of their crossbows, firing along the twisting 
hallways of the keep. But it would be harder for us to use our numbers 
against them. “Spread out,” I said as my army surged in. “Open all the 
doors, set guards over anything of value. Find Teleso. Kill the ones who 
don’t surrender. Tonight, Ravenna will be ours.”
The wolves were on the hunt; the keep had become a trap. We could smell 
our prey, fleeing helplessly into the farthest corners. I found myself with 
Mario, Giovanni, Michel, and about a dozen more Lupi. Giovanni had a 
sword and a crossbow that he’d taken from a surrendering soldier; I 
realized, looking at him, that all I had to defend myself with was my knife.
“Upstairs,” Mario said, so we followed him up the narrow spiral. As we 
emerged into the corridor, there was a snap of a bolt hitting the wall, and 
we saw a soldier retreating into a room, trying frantically to reload his 
crossbow. It was Tullo, one of the boys who’d come to my concerts. As we 
advanced on him, he dropped the bow and drew his sword. “Traitors,” he 
said in a shaky voice. “We should have hanged you with Jesca and Beneto.”
“Wrong way to say you surrender,” Michel said, and the Lupi surged 
forward. Tullo got in one good swing, wounding someone across the arm, 
and then they ripped the sword out of his hands like the shepherd’s “bow” 
and threw it aside.
“Bastardo,” Michel said, and threw Tullo against the wall. “Bastardo.” I

heard a coughing choke and saw a gush of red; one of the Lupi had stabbed 
Tullo in the chest. They backed off as Tullo fell onto his face, his hands 
grasping at the rug under him.
“I surrender,” Tullo choked, and died.
“Come on,” I said, willing my voice not to tremble. “We are wolves. This is 
war. Come on.”
The hallway outside the room was empty. There was a row of doors; 
several were open, the rooms empty. Then we came to a barred door. 
“Leave us alone,” a voice shouted from behind the door. “Teleso isn’t in 
here.”
“Break it down,” I said, and Mario and Michel slammed into it, knocking it 
off its hinges. I started to follow them into the room, but they pulled up 
short. I saw two men backing up against the far wall—Vincente and Ilario, 
not soldiers I liked. I shouldered Michel out of the way so that I could see 
the rest of the room.
“One step more,” Vincente said, “and she dies.”
I felt myself blanch and my hands started shaking. They had Arianna, 
Teleso’s maidservant. Vincente gripped her firmly by the arms, and Ilario 
held a sword to her throat.
“Stay back,” I said over my shoulder.
“What is it?” Giovanni asked.
“How are you planning to get out of Ravenna?” Michel asked. “Even if we 
let you walk out of this room.”
“Let her go,” Mario said. He was clenching his teeth so tightly I could see 
the veins in his neck. “Damn you. Let her go.”

“Oh yeah,” Vincente said. “Teleso’s maid is your little cunt, isn’t she, 
Mario?” Vincente glanced at Ilario, who raised an eyebrow, then nodded. 
“We’ll give you an even trade,” Vincente continued. “You for her. You’ll 
make just as good a hostage.”
“Mario—” I whispered.
“You for her!” Vincente shouted, jerking Arianna’s arms behind her so that 
she grimaced in pain. “You have five seconds to make the trade.”
“I’ll do it!” Mario said. “Don’t hurt her. I’ll do it.”
“Drop your weapons,” Vincente said.
“Don’t do it,” Arianna said.
Ilario slapped her on the face with the flat of the sword. “He didn’t ask 
you.”
“Don’t touch her!” Mario said. “Leave her alone.” He handed me his sword 
and his bow. “Me for her. Swear on your honor as a soldier to honor that.”
“Swear on the same honor you swore your loyalty on?” Ilario said.
“Mario, don’t,” I said. “He’s going to kill both of you.”
“They need a hostage to get out of here,” Mario whispered. “I’ll have a 
better chance of breaking free than Arianna.” He started slowly across the 
room. As he approached, Ilario lowered the sword from Arianna’s throat, 
and Vincente relaxed his hold on her arms. Finally, they shoved her away; 
Vincente grabbed Mario’s arms and twisted them behind him.
“I never liked traitors,” Ilario said, and drew back his sword.
“Mario,” Arianna screamed, as Ilario stabbed Mario in the gut.
Vincente dropped Mario onto the floor and looked up with a smile of

vicious satisfaction. “You’re right; we’ll never get out of Ravenna. Might as 
well take the opportunity to kill the traitor.”
“You can join him!” Michel shouted, running across the room, Giovanni on 
his heels.
Arianna had thrown herself to her knees next to Mario. “Help him,” she 
begged me, and I knelt beside them.
“I don’t know anything about healing—” I whispered, tearing his shirt 
open. I gagged at the smell of blood and rent bowels. If I could stop the 
bleeding ... I used my knife to cut loose the edge of Mario’s tunic, to try to 
hold it over the wound. “Mario, Mario, hold on. I’ll find Petro—”
Mario shook his head, his face contorted in pain. “Waste of time,” he 
muttered. “Go on, both of you. We are wolves, and this is war.”
Arianna clasped Mario’s hand and raised her anguished eyes to meet mine. 
“Teleso was here,” she said. “There’s a secret door behind that tapestry.” 
She pointed. “It opens to a staircase that leads down to his study. Maybe 
you can stop him—”
I looked down at Mario; he had closed his eyes, pressing Arianna’s hand to 
his lips. Then I stood up. “Giovanni!” I said. The Lupi were tearing apart 
the two soldiers; I pushed aside the tapestry. “This leads to Teleso’s study. 
Six of you—with me. The rest—meet us there.”
I spared a last glance toward Mario; he was whispering something to 
Arianna, pressing a knife into her hand. Then I turned and tore down the 
stairs. The darkness closed around us as we ran. I still clutched Mario’s 
sword and bow, although now that I was running down the stairs it 
occurred to me that I didn’t have a clue how to use the sword, and the bow 
would be useless on a spiral staircase. Oh well; it was too late to back off

now. We emerged, breathless but unchallenged, in Teleso’s study. 
Giovanni burst in a moment later. “No one,” I said.
“We need to organize,” Giovanni said. “What do we still need to secure? 
Teleso’s soldiers have scattered, but it’s a safe bet that they’ll try to cause 
us as much trouble as possible.”
“The horses,” I said. “Teleso won’t get far on foot, and we need the horses. 
Also the wagons. And this study; there might be information here we can 
use. And—Oh, hell. The grain.” I stood, my arms still full of useless 
weaponry. “I didn’t send anybody to guard the grain. What if Teleso—?”
Giovanni glanced past me to the Lupi. “You—stables. You—wagons. You 
guard the study.” He looked back at me. “Come on. No, wait.” He pulled 
the sword out of my hand. “You’re holding this wrong.”
“Giovanni, who cares? Let’s go.”
“You don’t know how to use a sword. The middle of a battle is not the time 
to take up new weapons. Stick with your knife and the bow—you’re less 
likely to kill yourself with your own weapons. Just don’t shoot yourself in 
the foot.” He handed off the sword to one of the soldiers, then grabbed my 
arm to run for the granary.
It was down near the kitchens; the small northwest tower was used 
entirely for food storage. The keep swarmed with refugees. We went down 
some more stairs and then down a narrow hallway to a door that was 
already open. I felt panic beginning to rise in my throat, I’m such a fool, 
Teleso knows how badly we need this grain. He knows. Through the door. 
Into the tower—
Giovanni pulled up short, putting out one arm to hold me back. “Shh,” he 
said.

From beyond the door into the granary, we could hear someone talking. 
“Can’t you think of anything more original than carving my guts out?” a 
calm woman’s voice demanded. The voice was pitched to carry as far as 
possible. “Niccolo, I’d have expected something more interesting from 
you.”
It was Lucia’s voice. I looked at Giovanni and saw my own horrified 
expression in his face. Gesturing for silence, he pulled me closer to the 
door and we peered in.
Niccolo stood with his back to the door, his sword in one hand, a torch in 
the other. Lucia sat in front of him. Her knife was a few feet away. He’d 
apparently disarmed her and then paused to gloat.
“I could burn you alive along with the grain,” Niccolo said. “Would that 
satisfy your desire for a novel form of martyrdom?”
“Well,” Lucia said, her voice still calm and cheerful. “It is the sort of thing 
I’d expect from a lackey of the Fedeli—”
Giovanni raised his crossbow and peered carefully down the sights. For a 
moment I thought he was going to do the sensible thing and shoot Niccolo 
in the back. Then— “Niccolo!” he shouted.
Niccolo whirled just as Giovanni fired the bow. The bolt missed him by 
inches. I raised my own bow, fired, missed.
“What kind of idiot stands with his back to the door?” Giovanni 
demanded, drawing his sword.
“What kind of idiot messes up a perfectly good shot by warning the 
target?” I said.
Niccolo didn’t answer. He glanced from me to Giovanni with a leer of

satisfaction. He opened his mouth to speak, then cried out in pain, twisted 
around to look behind him in astonishment, and collapsed onto his face on 
the floor. The torch fell from his hand.
Lucia stood behind him, a bloody knife in her hand. “Sorry to mess up 
your duel, Giovanni,” she said. She stamped out the torch, then wiped the 
knife off on Niccolo’s tunic. “Teleso’s last orders, apparently—burn the 
grain.”
“Why didn’t he?” I asked. I still had my own knife in my hand. I slipped it 
back into the hidden sheath in my boot.
“You know Niccolo,” Lucia said. “I think I could have kept him talking for 
another hour. He wants to see you scared, or it’s just no fun.” She looked 
down at Niccolo’s body. “I think I’m going to be ill,” she said, and threw up.
Back upstairs, we headed outside to take stock of the situation. Nobody 
seemed to be firing; the clash of swords had been replaced by the cries of 
the injured and dying. The dusty ground of the piazza was stained a dark 
mud brown from blood, and there were bodies everywhere. Fallen Lupi 
mixed with loyalist soldiers and mutineers; many had clothing so bloody I 
couldn’t have said which side they’d died for. I saw Rafi moving from 
fallen body to fallen body, comforting the living and drawing a cross over 
each of the dead.
“Did we win?” I said.
“Yeah,” Giovanni said, looking surprised that I’d asked. “We won.”
The Ravenessi began to swarm through the keep, touching the rugs and 
the curtains and the eggshell-thin glasses, breaking and stealing and 
dirtying. People were carrying off an amazing variety of items. Michel 
dragged a wine barrel toward the piazza with one of his friends. Isabella

had carved up a haunch of meat from the pantry and was cooking it in the 
gruel pot. I thought I saw the glint of a gilt-edged mirror, and several 
people had carried off rugs and tapestries and furniture to decorate their 
makeshift tents.
I heard a piercing screech from the door of the keep. “Behold,” Severo 
cried. “Teleso’s whore.”
“No,” Giula shrieked, trying to tear her hand away from him. “Leave me 
alone, leave me alone.”
“You know where he is,” Severo said. “You know where he’s gone! Tell us!” 
He smacked her hard across the face.
“I don’t know. He left me alone. He said he’d come back but he never 
came, leave me alone.” Giula still wore the dark red velvet dress, but it was 
crumpled and bloodstained. “Help me, please, somebody. Please. Please 
leave me alone.”
I watched for a moment in silence.
“Tell us what you know,” Severo said.
“I don’t know anything. I swear. I’ll swear by anything you want. I don’t 
know.” Giula was nearly hysterical.
“Well, we have you, in any case,” Severo said gently, touching her cheek, 
then backhanding her again. “You, Teleso’s whore.”
The one other person who would have defended Giula was Mario. So I 
strode over to where Severo was beating her. “Leave her alone,” I said.
Severo turned toward me, an ugly expression on his face. “What do you 
mean?”
“I mean what I said. Leave her alone. It’s because of her I didn’t follow

Jesca and Beneto to the gallows. She kept Teleso distracted. So leave her 
alone.” He released her slowly, letting her fall to the ground. “Have your 
fun with someone else,” I said.
“Niccolo’s already dead. I was hoping to kill him myself.”
I snorted. “If you’d thought to go guard the grain, you’d have had your 
opportunity. Go help guard the horses. If Teleso tries for a horse to escape, 
you’ll have a shot at him.”
Severo shuffled off, and I helped Giula to her feet. “Go change into a 
different dress,” I said. “Something less conspicuous.”
“I don’t know what Teleso did with my old clothes,” she said.
“Take some clothes off one of the bodies,” I said, but she burst into tears 
again, so I stripped a soldier and gave Giula the uniform.
“Those are boy’s clothes,” she said.
I rolled my eyes. “You’re going to have to live with it,” I said. “You’ll just 
get into trouble again walking around in the velvet.” Still pouting, she took 
the clothing and vanished into a tent to change.
Tomas approached. He’d torn the insignia off his uniform and wore a red 
sash. He saluted me. “The stables, granary, and armory are secured,” 
Tomas said. “Teleso’s study is under guard.”
I blinked at Tomas for a moment. “Does anyone know what’s happened to 
Teleso?” I asked.
“No, Generale,” Tomas said. “We’ve checked all the hiding spots that the 
soldier-Lupi knew of.”
“Are any of the horses missing?” Giovanni asked.
“No,” Tomas said. “If he got away, he fled on foot. We’ve sent out a search

party.”
“Keep looking,” I said.
Tomas saluted and headed back toward the stables.
“Your orders will be needed,” Lucia said, “on the question of the soldiers 
who surrendered.”
“Lock the ones who surrendered in the dungeon,” I said. “We’ll let them 
out before we leave—without weapons or food, the ones with any sense will 
head north. The ones who mutinied, let them go free. They’re ours now.”
“What next?” Giovanni asked.
I stared at the bloodstained piazza. “We bury our dead.”
Giovanni and Lucia were both silent for a moment. Then Giovanni asked, 
“Did Teleso keep papers somewhere?”
I blinked at him.
“That’s something I can take care of this afternoon and tonight,” Giovanni 
said. “We should sort through them systematically. See if there’s any 
information of use to us.”
“Oh,” I said. “Of course. He kept papers in his study, I believe. That’s why I 
wanted a guard placed over it—as much to keep out the Ravenessi as the 
soldiers.”
Giovanni grinned—the friendliest look he’d given me yet. “I’ll take care of 
that tonight, then.”
Lucia slipped her arm around my waist. “Was there anything else you 
wanted to save, here? Or take for your own?”
“No,” I said. “I think everything important is under guard.”

“Then you’ve won,” Lucia said. “Celebrate your victory.”
Ran had formed uninjured volunteers into two groups, moving the injured 
inside out of the sun, and carrying the bodies down to the gravel pit near 
the wall. “Right,” I said. “Celebrate.” I walked out to the piazza and picked 
up one of the bodies. “We won.”
I couldn’t believe the number of dead, as I carried bodies. If I’d been 
asked, I wouldn’t have thought there were so many people in all of 
Ravenna. The bodies were still warm from the sunshine, and were only 
beginning to become stiff. Some of the bodies, I could carry alone—the 
Ravenessi were thin and light from deprivation. The soldiers I carried with 
one other. We stripped the soldiers’ bodies before placing them in the 
gravel pit to be buried, because we would need what they had to survive; 
the Ravenessi had nothing worth taking.
I did this.
The bodies were my fault. I hadn’t struck a single fatal blow—personally—
in the entire battle; the only attempt I’d made was my wasted shot at 
Niccolo. Nonetheless, every body here, every soldier or Ravenessi dead 
was my fault. Lady forgive me, I thought, when I started this I didn’t 
realize so many would die because of me.
In the midafternoon sun, I called over someone to help me with the body 
of a soldier. Michel had come to help carry bodies—I think he was trying to 
keep an eye on me, uncertain if his job as “bodyguard” was still required 
now that we’d won—and he came over to help me carry this one. It wasn’t 
until we were halfway to the gravel pit that I looked at the face of the man 
we carried. “Oh—” I gasped, and stumbled, nearly falling. “Lady’s tits. 
Mario.”

“Are you all right?” Michel asked. He lowered Mario’s feet and came to 
support me. I knelt slowly, cradling Mario’s body. I’d known he was dying
—no one could survive a wound like that—but I’d managed to push it out 
of my mind, telling myself I’d overestimated the severity of the injury. 
“Mario,” I said again.
“Do you want me to get someone else to carry him?” Michel asked.
“No!” I said. “No, I’ll do it—” I looked toward the gravel pit, only a short 
distance away. “Michel, go get a shovel. They’ll have some in the stables.”
“Yes, Generale,” he said, scrambling back to his feet. “I’ll be right back. 
Don’t go anywhere, all right? Don’t try to carry him by yourself.”
Mario’s hands were warm from the sun, and his eyes were closed, his face 
peaceful. The red sash he’d put on to start the mutiny was stained a darker 
brown and black from his blood. I closed my eyes for a moment, squeezing 
his warm, light hand.
“Generale,” Michel’s voice said, and I opened my eyes again. He’d brought 
a shovel, and Giovanni. Just who I wanted to see.
Giovanni’s face was sober as he lifted Mario’s feet. Michel carried the 
shovel. “Where did you want to take him?” Giovanni asked me.
“Out of the camp,” I said. “The other side of the hill.”
Giovanni nodded, and we carried Mario’s body out of the camp. We set 
Mario down and I took the shovel from Michel. “I didn’t want to bury him 
in the mass grave,” I said. My throat was tight. I waited for Giovanni’s 
sarcastic response, but he only nodded.
“Do you want to get your violin?” Giovanni asked. “To play him a funeral 
Mass?”

I shook my head. “Mario worshipped the Lady. We can’t give him a 
Redentore funeral.”
We took turns digging the grave. Finally it was deep enough; we lowered 
the body in.
“Should we get Margherita?” Michel asked.
I shook my head. “The Book of the Lady says that a soldier should be 
buried by his fellows,” I said. My voice caught again. “Mario was one of us. 
It’s right that we do it. Just-I-” I looked at Michel and Giovanni. “Don’t tell 
Lucia.”
“Don’t worry,” Giovanni said. “This will be between the three of us.”
We joined hands around the open grave. “From earth we come, to earth we 
return,” I said. My voice was shaking. “From dust we come, to dust we 
return. From our mothers’ wombs we come, to the Lady’s womb we 
return.”
“So shall it be,” Michel and Giovanni said.
We clapped our hands three times, to drive off the Maledori. “Those who 
walk with the Lord and the Lady in life will walk with Them in the life to 
come. Those who look to the Lord in life will regard Him in truth in the life 
to come. Those who cling to the Lady in life will be held in Her arms in the 
life to come.”
“So shall it be,” Michel and Giovanni said.
We clapped our hands three times again.
“Lord and Lady,” I said, and fell silent for a moment. Tradition required 
each of us to speak briefly, out loud to the Lord and the Lady, to tell Them 
why Mario’s soul deserved to be guided quickly to the life to come. My

throat closed, and I bowed my head, fighting back tears.
Giovanni touched my arm gently, then raised his hands to the sky. “Lord 
and Lady,” he said. “Mario was Your faithful servant when anyone else 
would have turned away from You. I have seen many in my life who 
claimed to have faith, of one kind or another. I’ve met Your Fedeli, I’ve 
prayed in Your cathedrals. I’ve met only a few who truly believed. And 
Mario put them all to shame.” Giovanni paused and started to lower his 
arms, then changed his mind and raised them again. “Guide his soul to the 
life to come,” he said, “or You’re a couple of petty small-minded deities 
with no respect for the best kind of man.” Giovanni lowered his arms.
“So may it be,” I said. I felt my lips twitch into a smile. I wasn’t sure what 
Mario would have thought of that eulogy. I hoped he’d approve.
Michel raised his hands to the sky. “Lord and Lady,” he said. “Mario was 
the bravest man I ever met. I’d been afraid of the battle I knew was coming
—even though I was training to fight in it, and training other people to 
fight in it, I was afraid that when it came right down to the actual battle I’d 
panic and run away. But Mario stood up and put on a sash like ours, and I 
knew I could fight. I could fight because he could fight, and he was turning 
away from everything he’d ever known. I was fighting for survival, but he 
was fighting because he believed in us— how could I not live up to that?” 
Michel paused. “So You’d better take his soul.” He looked as if he was 
going to continue, but thought the better of it and lowered his arms.
“So may it be,” Giovanni and I said.
It was my turn. I raised my arms again. “Lord and Lady,” I said. “Mario 
was the truest man I ever met. He joined our cause because he believed in 
us—and because he believed in You. His faith in You drove him to stand

against slavery; his faith in You made him turn against his commander. 
You were dearer to him than his life. But I’m not going to ask You to take 
his soul.” My voice broke. “You can give him back to us. We wouldn’t 
refuse.”
“So may it be,” Giovanni and Michel said.
We were silent for several minutes. Then I said, “Mario, return to the 
womb of the Lady.” We shoveled the dirt over his body, filling in the grave.
That was all there was to the funeral service. “Are you ready to go back?” 
Giovanni asked.
“I have another prayer to say,” I said, so Giovanni and Michel both bowed 
their heads and waited.
I knelt and drew a cross in the mound of dirt. “God,” I said. “Mario was not 
a Redentore. He believed in and loved the Lord and the Lady as Lucia 
believes in You. But Mario gave his life for Arianna because he loved her. 
He died like Gèsu to save someone else. There’s a line from The Journey 
that I’ve heard a few times: ‘There is no greater love than that of the one 
who gives his life for his friend.’ ” I took a deep breath. “I’ve heard people 
say that You turn Your back on those who lack God’s seal. Well, if You turn 
Your back on Mario, You’re a small-minded deity with no respect for the 
best kind of man.” I took out Bella’s cross and kissed it. “I have faith that 
You see beyond the form of worship to the faith and love below. Grant 
Your Light and Your peace to Mario. B’shem Arka, v’barah, v’nehora 
kadosha.”
“Amen,” Mario and Giovanni said.
“If you don’t mind,” I said, “I think I’d like to be alone for a little while.”

Mario died because of me. He gave his life to save Arianna, but he died 
because of me. I wept by his grave for a long time. There would be more 
fighting from here—I knew that. People would look to me to lead it. But all 
I could think of was all the people who had died. I didn’t want any more 
deaths on my soul.
I stared at Mario’s grave. I remembered him saying, “I don’t want to die,” 
his face sad and frightened like a child’s. Well, he had died anyway. What 
now? I stared down, remembering the last grave I’d dug, when I’d worked 
alone to bury my family. Could I bear to dig any more graves? What if I 
just walked away?
What would Mario say, if he were here? I closed my eyes, imagining 
Mario’s gentle face. Honor my memory, he would say, that was easy 
enough. Honor my sacrifice by not wasting it. Honor my life by showing 
the courage I showed, by doing what’s right even when it’s terrifying. 
Honor my memory by leading this struggle, if it’s truly the right thing to 
do. Bear this burden by being the best leader you can, and knowing that 
many more would lie dead today, had anyone else led this battle.
I stood up. “Good-bye, Mario,” I said, and brushed the dirt to erase the 
cross I’d drawn. “Thank you.”
When I returned to Ravenna, all the bodies had been buried, all the 
injured moved indoors. The keep’s contents had been largely emptied. I 
wasn’t sure what the Ravenessi were planning to do with the furniture; as 
far as I knew, no one was taking up permanent residence here, and the 
beds didn’t look portable.
I decided to visit my troops, and made a tour of the stables, the granary,

and the armory. The Lupi responded enthusiastically when they saw me; I 
shook everyone’s hand, told them they’d done a fine job, assured them 
there’d be more fighting if they were interested, and moved on.
As evening fell, Margherita lit a bonfire in the piazza. It was Midsummer’s 
Eve; I’d forgotten. Only a few families had decamped; most seemed 
inclined to stay with the festivities for a while yet. Margherita started to 
lead an almost Redentore-style dance in the piazza, and I realized 
suddenly that I had left my violin lying on the hill next to Lucia, where we 
had slept last night. In a panic, I ran to find it—of course, it was gone. 
Lady’s tits, Lady’s tits, I thought as I ran to Rafi’s tent—not there either. 
How could I be so stupid? What am I going to do? Where am I going to 
get another one? Maybe Lucia had taken it with her, left it somewhere. I 
went looking for Lucia.
Rafi’s hospital was in the keep; he’d taken over most of the first floor. 
Lucia knelt next to a woman with a wound so severe I was stunned that 
she was still alive. I waited for a moment, and Lucia looked up.
“My violin,” I whispered.
Lucia smiled. “Took you this long to go looking, did it?” She patted the 
hand of the woman she’d been sitting with, and rose to come over near me. 
Lucia walked stiffly, like she’d been kneeling for a long time. “It’s fine. I 
left it with Rafi, and he put it in Teleso’s study, with the Lupi guarding 
there. It’s probably still sitting on the chair in the corner by the desk.”
“Thank you,” I said. I lowered my eyes and glanced toward the woman 
Lucia had been sitting with. She had taken a bad wound from one of the 
bolts, and would not live much longer. I realized with a shock that it was 
Elettra—the Redentore woman with the sick child Lucia had prayed for. 
“It’s odd, Lucia—I feel very useless just now.”

“Come pray with me,” she said. “Just for a minute. It would comfort 
Elettra.”
I allowed Lucia to draw me to the woman’s side and knelt down. Lucia 
pulled a loop of ribbon from around her neck; it held a tiny vial. “Holy oil,” 
she said. “You know how to pray for healing?”
“Not really,” I said. Was she going to try to get me to do the full ritual? “I 
saw you do it once, that’s all.”
“Improvise, then,” she said. “Go on. Elettra knows you’re here.”
Elettra moaned softly, and I tentatively took her hand. It was cold and 
damp, and I held it for a moment, trying to warm it with my own. “Elettra, 
daughter of ...” I didn’t know her parents’ names. “Elettra, daughter of 
God.” I dabbed some of the oil onto my finger from the bottle Lucia had 
given me, and drew an X on Elettra’s forehead, then kissed it; it was hot 
under my lips, like the dust of Ravenna at midday. I drew an X on her 
hands, her feet, and over her heart, then clasped her hands and closed my 
eyes. “Refuya, Arka,” I sang. “Refuya, Gèsu.” A tiny thread of the energy I 
felt as I played the Dance That Turned the Storm came through me, and 
instead of sending it into the earth under my feet, I tried to send it through 
my hands, into Elettra’s body. I imagined her wounds closing, color 
returning to her cheeks, hope returning to her eyes. For just a moment, 
with my eyes closed, I could almost believe it was true.
Elettra moaned again, as the last notes of the song died away, and I 
opened my eyes to see her wound unchanged. I told myself that I wasn’t 
really disappointed; what did I expect? I shook my head and squeezed her 
hands gently, then detached myself. “I think I should go.”

Lucia caught my sleeve briefly. “I’ve been in here, Eliana, so I haven’t 
heard what’s going on—do you know if Mario—”
“Mario is dead,” I said.
Lucia nodded, her face grieved but serene. “What’s next?” she said. “Do we 
take on the Circle?”
I sat back on my heels. “Lady’s tits, I hope not,” I said. “We can defeat a 
demoralized pack of soldiers with eight-to-one odds when half of them 
mutiny and the other half run like hell. Do you think we’re ready to take 
on the Circle?”
“What, then?”
“I don’t know,” I said. “I’ll think of something.” Elettra moaned again, and 
Lucia glanced back toward her. “I think I’ll go down to Teleso’s study,” I 
said. “I should get my violin.”

Giovanni was alone in the study. He’d barred the door; I had to bang on it 
to get him to let me in. “Is working alone a good idea?” I asked.
Giovanni gave me a defensive look. “The Lupi wanted to go join the party. 
I didn’t see any harm in that. I barricaded the secret door, too,” he said, 
and pointed at the chair he’d shoved in front of it.
“You’re assuming that’s the only secret door.”
“What kind of idiot would build all his secret passages leading to the same 
room?”
“Teleso vanished without a trace,” I said. “And we still don’t know how. 
Have you found anything of interest?”
“Teleso’s hit list,” he said, waving a piece of paper at me. I took it and

looked at it. I’d seen the list before. Beneto and Jesca’s names, circled and 
then checked off. Lucia’s name, circled. My name had been added to the 
bottom, and circled. I snorted.
“I’ve also found demonstrable evidence that Teleso was embezzling,” 
Giovanni said. “Pocketing part of the money that was supposed to feed the 
Ravenessi and his men. He was doing a clumsy job of it, too. My father 
taught me some bookkeeping. I never took to it, but even I could spot 
Teleso’s number-juggling.”
“Is that all?”
“I’m afraid so. There’s plenty of paper left to go through, though.” 
Giovanni waved his hand at one of the piles. “Feel free to make yourself 
useful.”
No sarcastic comments came immediately to mind, so I sat down and 
started reading. I made slower progress than Giovanni. “Anything in 
particular that you’re looking for?” I asked.
He shrugged. “Stuff that’s interesting. Stuff we didn’t already know. You 
know. Useful information.”
I found a roster of soldiers’ names, with a small mark next to each. I took a 
close look. “I think this is a list of who Teleso thought was on his side,” I 
said.
“That’s useful,” Giovanni said. “Tell us which mutineers to keep an eye on.”
I leafed through a sheaf of folded papers tied with a blue ribbon. “Letters 
from his sister,” I said.
Giovanni snorted. “Those are useless.”
I read through one anyway and concluded he was right. I tossed the rest

aside.
“Hey,” Giovanni said. “Intelligence on the situation in Cuore. We can read 
these over later.”
The next stack was supply inventories. The next pile had a diagram of the 
wall, and how it should look when construction was complete. Under that 
was a rough sketch—a curving line with seven slashes along it. One was 
labeled “Ravenna.” “Hey, Giovanni,” I said. “What is this?”
He took the piece of paper and then spread it out on the desk, his interest 
growing rapidly. “You’ve found something,” he said. “Eliana, you have 
definitely found something.”
“What?” I asked. “I don’t have that oh-so-useful university background, 
you know.”
“Oh, give it up,” he said. “It’s a map. See, this is Ravenna. This is the wall, 
or where the wall will be when it’s all done. These other marks—they’re 
other camps like Ravenna. Probably also working on part of the wall.”
“Seven camps?” I asked.
“Six, now,” Giovanni said.
“Do they have the same numbers of soldiers and slaves?” I asked.
“It doesn’t say. They’re probably smaller. Up in Cuore, the reformers had 
only heard about Ravenna ... but, well, that probably doesn’t mean much. 
And who knows, these might be new. I’ve been out of touch for a while.” 
He pushed back a lock of glossy black hair. “So what do you think?”
“I think those are excellent targets,” I said. “I didn’t want to take the Circle 
on starting tomorrow—we’re still too new at this, and new in ways that 
playing Lupi isn’t going to solve.”

Giovanni nodded, his eyes glinting with excitement. “We need real 
battles,” he said. “We can become a real army once we’ve had a chance to 
fight.”
“It looks like we’ve got six chances,” I said. “More recruits, too. And even 
the ones who don’t join up—”
“They can stir up trouble,” he said. “Serve as distractions. Make our 
enemies divide their strength.”
Our eyes met, across the desk. Giovanni’s eyes were almost as bright as 
Lucia’s. “This could work,” I said.
“This could really work,” he said.
Our eyes held for a moment. Then he cupped the back of my neck with his 
hand, and drew my face toward his, pressing his lips against mine. I could 
feel the heat from his cheeks, and the roughness of his stubble; his hand 
was sweaty and damp on my neck.
I jerked away. “What are you doing?” I demanded.
His face flared red. “Um. Nothing.”
“Good,” I said. I felt a flush rising to my own cheeks.
Giovanni’s wounded pride was fueling irritation, then anger. “I think I’m 
going to go out for a walk,” he said. “Let me know if you find anything else 
interesting.” He slammed the door behind him.
I turned back to the pile of papers, trying to shrug off Giovanni. It was 
Midsummer’s Eve, I realized suddenly, and thought with a half-laugh that 
if I had slept with Giovanni, it wouldn’t count. Somehow, that didn’t make 
the idea any more attractive. I suddenly wondered if he was just outside in 
the corridor—I could imagine him out there, face flushed, heart pounding.

I got up to check, ready with a wisecrack if he was out there, but the hall 
was empty. Disappointed, I closed the door and sat back down. As I sorted 
through the papers, I heard a very, very faint creak. My head snapped up 
and I turned to look— and saw Teleso, emerging from behind a set of 
cabinets. He didn’t see me right away, but started toward the desk. If he 
had heard our voices, then heard the door open and close twice—he’d have 
thought the study was empty.
I sucked in my breath to shout for help and Teleso turned. Our eyes met; 
he was just as stunned to see me as I was to see him. Giovanni’s crossbow 
lay across the desk; I snatched it up and fired at Teleso. He howled in pain, 
and for an instant I thought I’d mortally wounded him, but I’d only caught 
him in his left thigh.
Teleso drew his sword. “Why, Eliana,” he said. “You just don’t like any 
men, do you?”
Lady’s tits, Lady’s tits, I thought, and threw down the crossbow, pulling 
my knife from the sheath hidden in my boot. “Not if you and Giovanni are 
a representative sample,” I said. This was going to be a very uneven fight, I 
thought, and a short one. Teleso was a soldier, trained for years in 
swordplay, and I stood here waving a knife, after a couple of lessons from 
Giovanni, that master of swordsmanship and tutelage. “Help!” I shouted. 
“Michel! Tomas!” I’d settle for Giovanni, but I’d be damned if I was going 
to shout for him.
Teleso lunged toward me, and I threw my chair into his path. He stumbled 
and I realized I’d injured his leg fairly badly with that crossbow bolt. 
Giovanni would probably know exactly how to use that to his advantage. 
Attack from the left side, I supposed, but I wasn’t really sure that was how

it worked. Teleso circled the room warily. I mirrored him, trying to look 
convincingly dangerous. As Teleso passed with his back to the study door, 
I looked straight past his shoulder and slapped a smile of relief onto my 
face. “Michel! Thank the Lady!” I exclaimed.
Teleso whirled to look, and I threw the knife at him. It embedded itself 
nicely in his right shoulder blade and he screeched again. Unfortunately, 
he still wasn’t dead, and I no longer had the knife. I grabbed the fireplace 
poker as Teleso wrenched his other arm around to pull out the knife, and 
hurled that at him as well.
“Bitch,” he shouted, and dodged aside. It missed his head, but bounced off 
his arm. He wasn’t dead, but he was holding the sword with his left hand 
now, and limping badly. His clothes, previously unsullied, were turning 
red with his blood.
“Help!” I shouted again. Where the hell was everybody?
“Enough with this,” Teleso said. Clenching his teeth, he lunged toward me 
again. I threw another chair in his path, but he saw it coming this time, 
and vaulted over it, throwing me against the wall and pinning me there 
with his sword’s blade. He smiled at me as I felt the blood drain from my 
face.
Talk fast, I thought. “You know, you’re really not a very good judge of 
people, Teleso,” I said.
“Why do you say that?” Teleso asked.
“Giovanni and I found that list of soldiers—who you thought were on your 
side.” Teleso was silent, the sword still at my throat. I closed my eyes for 
one heartbeat, then opened them again and looked him straight in the eye. 
“Assuming we interpreted your list correctly, you thought Niccolo was

yours. You know how you sent him to burn the grain? He jumped, Teleso—
he betrayed you.”
Teleso went rigid with shock, and I threw myself to the side. The sword 
grazed my throat, stinging. I shoved a chair between us, then ran behind 
the desk. I thought I remembered a weapon here earlier, and sure enough, 
stacked in Giovanni’s “useful” pile was an ornate dagger that had probably 
come out of Teleso’s desk. I grabbed it up, armed again.
“Not Niccolo,” Teleso said. “He wouldn’t betray me. He was the only one 
on my side!” His sword half sagged, he was still so stunned, and I grabbed 
up the poker in my left hand and advanced on him.
“Niccolo betrayed you,” I said. “And Giula was working for me. Day after 
tomorrow, she was going to poison your wine. Unfortunately, you moved 
before our plans were fully in place. But that’s all right—we beat you 
anyway.”
Teleso threw himself at me; I slammed the sword aside with the poker, 
almost knocking it out of his hand. “I’ll see you dead,” he shouted.
“Keep dreaming, bastardo,” I said. His sword was coming back up, and I 
decided to try for one more lie. “You know, it’s too bad you want me dead 
now,” I said. “If it weren’t for your garlic breath, I’d have found you very 
attractive.”
Teleso blanched, his sword sagging completely in total stunned shock. I 
lunged toward him, slamming my knife into his gut like the soldiers had 
stabbed Mario. He screamed in agony and fell to the floor, his sword 
slipping out of his hand. I kicked it out of his reach. Blood was pouring 
from the wound, drenching the rug, my hands, my tunic. The room 
smelled of blood and bowels, and I backed up, gagging.

The room was silent for a moment, except for Teleso’s gasping sobs.
“You had me beaten because I wouldn’t sleep with you!” I shouted. “You 
turned my friend against me! You ran a slave-labor camp while mouthing 
loyalty to the Lady!” I bent to pick up his sword. His eyes were closed. “But 
you know, Niccolo didn’t betray you. Giula wasn’t working for me. I never 
found you attractive, and you never had garlic breath. I hated you for what 
you were.”
I wasn’t sure if he heard me, but his face was in agony. Raising the sword, I 
brought it down as hard as I could. I didn’t fully sever his head, but his 
breathing stopped and his face went slack. I half expected to throw up, as 
Lucia had, but I was so relieved to have survived the fight that I couldn’t 
even smell the blood. “I am a wolf,” I said aloud, trying to catch my breath.
The door opened and Giovanni stared in. “Lady’s tits‘.” he shouted, and 
ran into the room. My hands were slick with blood, and the sword slipped 
out of my grasp and clanged to the floor. Giovanni grabbed my shoulders, 
looking me up and down. “Is any of this blood yours?”
“No,” I said. The gush of Teleso’s blood had been warm, but the blood was 
starting to cool, to solidify. I was suddenly overwhelmed with the 
disgusting feeling of it on me. “I need to go wash my hands.”
“Did you kill him?” Giovanni asked. “By yourself?”
“Yes,” I said.
“See?” Giovanni said. “Those knife lessons did come in handy. Come on. 
I’ll find Lucia and we can get you cleaned up.”
“Teleso came out to look for something,” I said. “Something in the desk—
and he was listening, so he must have assumed that we hadn’t already

found it.”
Giovanni’s eyes lit up. “I’ll find it,” he said. “I’ll take the desk apart if I have 
to.”
When I came back to the study, damp but clean, Giovanni held out a small 
box. “There was a hidden compartment in the back of the top drawer. This 
was inside.”
I sat down by the desk and opened the box. Inside was a single lock of 
black hair.
“His daughter’s,” Giovanni said. “I’d heard a rumor that he once had a 
wife, but I hadn’t quite believed it.”
I touched the soft curl gently. “What are we going to do with this?” I asked.
Giovanni shrugged. “Up to you.”
“What was done with Teleso’s body?” I asked.
“It was taken outside. Someone will toss it in with the rest of the bodies in 
the grave in the morning.”
Teleso’s body lay just outside the keep, with a few others who had died 
from their wounds tonight. The person who had carried out the body had 
set it down carefully, aligning the head with the rest of him. His body had 
stiffened, and I shuddered at the touch of his cold flesh, but this wouldn’t 
take long. I tucked the box with its lock of hair into Teleso’s torn shirt, 
beside his heart. Even Teleso deserved that much.
* * *
In the gray dawn, I stood by the ashes of the bonfire that had been kindled 
with the chairs from Teleso’s dining room. My hungover army was 
assembled before me, Teleso’s body wrapped in a shroud behind me.

“You have a choice now,” I said. “We know of villages that are not in the 
wasteland but were destroyed by the Circle. Those who don’t want to fight
—especially the children and the elderly—can resettle those villages. The 
land is good; the spring crops were planted and may even be growing. 
Hopefully, the rest of us will be making enough trouble soon to keep the 
Circle busy and well away from you.” I paused and looked at the faces of 
the people in my army. They looked back—sleepy in some cases, breathless 
in others. When my eyes met Michel’s, he saluted me, and I found myself 
smiling.
“For the rest of us,” I said, “yesterday is only the beginning of the fight. 
There are six more camps like Ravenna, with thousands more people like 
us, enslaved and starved and brutalized by the Circle. Six more camps.” I 
started to pace, energized by the anticipation of the crowd. No one looked 
sleepy anymore. “We’re going to march in like the tide—no one will stop 
us. We’re going to sweep in like fire—nothing will be left in our path. We’re 
going to run in like wolves—we hunt in a pack. We are going to free every 
one of our people, and give them a chance to join us. And then we will 
sweep into Cuore itself and burn the Circle with God’s fire—the fire of 
justice, and freedom, and righteous anger.” The crowd shifted and I knew 
they were coming. I had my army. “Are you with me?” I demanded.
“Yes!” The force of the cry nearly knocked me down.
“Are you with me?”
“Yes!”
“Then gather up what you need and meet me on the north hill in two 
hours. We march at midday.”
Giovanni waited for me at the door to the keep. “Good speech. No one is

going to go to Doratura.”
“None of the children will march with the army,” I said. “I won’t allow it.”
“Wise policy,” he said. “There weren’t any other papers of interest. I 
burned what was left.”
“Good.”
“Noon,” he said, and shook his head. “We’ll be out of here in 
midafternoon, at the earliest. Tomorrow would have been a bit more 
practical. Are the horses and wagons ready?”
“Maybe,” I said.
Giovanni shook his head in studied disbelief. “Meaning that you haven’t 
actually sent anyone to take care of it? What the hell kind of Generale are 
you, anyway?”
“The one who’s in charge here,” I said.
Giovanni sighed. “You need to learn how to delegate,” he said. “It’s the 
only way you’re going to be able to make this work. Generali don’t do 
everything themselves; even Beneto had a second.”
“Are you asking for the position?”
“Are you kidding? You should be my second.” He paused for a moment. 
“Also, you need to learn to ride a horse.”
“Why?”
“Because generali do not walk to battles. Besides, when you’re on a horse, 
it’s easy to get people’s attention. You’re up high where they can see you.”
“And shoot at me,” I said.
“Well, that’s why you also need a bodyguard, on another horse.”

“That would not be you,” I said.
“No, of course not. I don’t want to take a crossbow bolt for you. I’ll teach 
Michel to ride as well.”
“Great,” I muttered.
“The knife-fighting came in handy, didn’t it? Trust me on this.” He was 
enjoying himself, I could tell; he was going to enjoy the riding lessons even 
more.
Still, on Giovanni’s suggestion, I divided up my red-sashed soldiers into 
smaller companies, then put someone I knew and trusted in charge of each 
group. I could demote my officers later if they caused too much trouble. I 
sent the obvious children off to the village. My army was a strange mix—
two dozen of the mutineer soldiers mixed in with the Ravenessi. I hoped 
not too many of those were spies.
As I was checking over the soldiers, I found myself face-to-face with 
Arianna. She met my eyes challengingly, daring me to send her off to 
Doratura with the children.
“Do you really want to be here?” I asked.
She lifted her chin. “I won’t let you leave me behind. If you don’t let me 
join you, I’ll follow you. If you tie me up, I’ll—”
I touched her shoulder. “Fine,” I said. “You’ve convinced me.” She’d found 
a red sash somewhere. Looking at it for a moment, I realized it was a strip 
torn from the skirt of that red velvet dress.
Arianna noticed my look and smiled cautiously. “Giula wasn’t wearing it at 
the time,” she said. She carried Mario’s knife at her side.
“Well.” I looked around the army. There were hundreds of people,

spreading out across the ruins of the camp, and the plains around me. 
“Let’s go hunting.”
