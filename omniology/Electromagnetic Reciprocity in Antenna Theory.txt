Introduction
Reciprocity theorems are among the most intriguing concepts in the study of
wave ﬁelds. Since its introduction by H.A. Lorentz in 1896 [33], the concept
of reciprocity has become an integral part of (almost) all standard textbooks
on electromagnetic (EM) theory (e.g., [27], Sec. 3.8). Its early developments
in electrical engineering refer to Rayleigh’s (acoustic) reciprocity theorem [32]
and are closely related to Kirchhoff’s networks [5]. Widespread applications of
EM reciprocity were initially obstructed by a somewhat narrow understanding
of the concept of reciprocity and its conditions of validity [2,6]. An important
step forward in putting EM reciprocity into practical use was the introduction
of the concept of reaction [37]. While still limited to the “source-ﬁeld inter-
action” only, its illuminating notation has paved the way for the development
of novel approximate solutions (e.g., Ref. [8]) and variational computational
formulations [26]. The original EM reciprocity with the time-harmonic depen-
dence were extended by Welch, who ﬁrst presented an EM reciprocity theorem
of the time-correlation type applying to homogeneous, isotropic, and lossless
media [50] and, subsequently, changed the theorem into its time-convolution
type and included conductive losses [51]. A clear distinction between the reci-
procity theorem of the time-convolution and time-correlation types has been
later given by Bojarski [3] who has stressed the importance of the nature of
the time dependence with respect to the radiation condition. His generalized
time-domain (TD) reciprocity theorem, however, is restricted to homogeneous
and isotropic media, where the EM ﬁeld representation in terms of the scalar
and vector potentials applies. This has been later extended by de Hoop [14],
who has introduced the general forms of the EM reciprocity theorems for EM
ﬁeld states in linear, time-invariant, yet arbitrarily inhomogeneous,anisotropic,
and dispersive media.
The current understanding of the reciprocity theorem can be brieﬂy stated
as follows ([16], Sec. 28.1): “A reciprocity theorem interrelates, in a speciﬁc
manner, the EM ﬁeld or wave quantities that characterize two admissible states
that could occur in one and the same time-invariant domain of space. Each
of the two states can be associated with its own set of time-invariant medium

Introduction
parameters and its own set of source distributions.” In this general sense, the
reciprocity theorem is no longer understood as a mere statement about the
source-observer interchange, but it is rather envisaged as being representative
of the quantitative interaction between the observed ﬁeld quantity (or the EM
ﬁeld to be actually calculated) and an observational action (or a suitable testing
state) in any EM measurement (or computational) conﬁguration. Accordingly,
the reciprocity theorem encompasses all the formulations of direct/inverse
source/scattering problems [16,22,23] and can be thus understood as a truly
unifying principle in the wave ﬁeld modeling [15]. This view is also followed
throughout this book, where the EM reciprocity theorem is applied to analyze
EM reciprocity properties of multiport antenna systems.
In Chapter 1 we make the reader acquainted with some basic mathematical
tools necessary for the reciprocity-based antenna system analysis. In partic-
ular, we deﬁne the one-sided Laplace transformation and discuss its use in
the context of the EM reciprocity theorems of the time-convolution and time-
correlation types. Most of the results in the book are then derived under the
Laplace transformation, that is, in the complex-frequency domain (FD). Fur-
thermore,the generic (multiport) antenna conﬁguration is described. In partic-
ular, we discuss the antenna-system material constitutive parameters and the
proper deﬁnition of Kirchhoff-type accessible ports.
In Chapter 2 we analyze the conditions that must be placed upon the antenna-
system constitutive parameters to get one and the same radiated causal EM
wave ﬁelds. Since the proof of uniqueness largely relies on Lerch’s theorem,
this chapter is supplemented with Appendix A, where the theorem along with
its proof are given.
In Chapter 3 we provide a special form of the forward-scattering theorem (in
the complex-FD) that applies to the analyzed multiport antenna conﬁguration.
Its real-FD and time-domain (TD) counterparts are subsequently discussed in
the corresponding exercise at the end of the chapter.
In Chapter 4 it is shown that the classic (local) conjugate matching condition
has its (global) counterpart expressed in terms of the corresponding scattered
and radiated far-ﬁeld amplitudes. The full equivalence between the two match-
ing conditions is then demonstrated for an important class of small antennas
in the accompanying (solved) exercises.
In Chapter 5 we apply the reciprocity theorem of the time-convolution type
to one and the same 𝑁-port antenna system to ﬁnd its equivalent Kirchhoff
network representations. The corresponding equivalent source generators are
speciﬁed for the excitation via a known volume-current distribution and via an
incident plane wave. The chapter is concluded by a solved exercise, where the
relation between the absorption cross section of the load and the antenna gain
is rigorously derived for an 1-port antenna system.
TheimpactofascattererontheequivalentKirchhoffnetworkrepresentations
of a multiport antenna system is described in Chapter 6. Both transmitting and

Introduction

receiving situations are studied in detail. In the corresponding exercise, we
analyze the contribution of a small raindrop to the equivalent voltage-source
strength of a short-wire antenna.
In Chapter 7 the EM reciprocity theorems are applied to analyze the mutual
EM coupling between two multiport antenna systems. Here, without loss of
generality, the interaction is described in terms of (open-circuited) impedance
parameters. Some interesting properties of the transfer-impedance matrix that
follow from the application of the time-convolution and time-correlation reci-
procity theorems are pointed out.
The EM ﬁeld transfer between two multiport antenna systems is inevitably
affected by the presence of neighboring objects. In Chapter 8 we apply the EM
reciprocity theorems to show howthepresenceofsuch an objectmanifests itself
in the transfer-impedance matrix. This chapter is further supplemented with
an illustrative exercise that results in an efﬁcient formula for lightning-induced
EM coupling calculations.
In Chapter 9 we study EM compensation theorems that relate the change of
antenna-system EM scattering properties to its radiation characteristics in the
corresponding transmitting situation. The obtained compensation relations are
next applied to shed some light on the adequacy of the Kirchhoff network rep-
resentations of a multiport receiving antenna system. The concluding exercises
deal with special cases of the derived compensation theorems and with their
application to small antennas.

Basic Prerequisites
We shall investigate EM radiation, scattering, and reciprocity properties of
antenna systems, an example of which is shown in Figure 1.1. To analyze
such space–time problems, it is necessary to localize the point in the problem
conﬁguration and register the instant at which a given wave ﬁeld quantity
occurs in its evolution following the source excitation. To this end, we will
employ the Cartesian reference frame that is deﬁned via its basis vectors
{𝒊1, 𝒊2, 𝒊3} and the origin denoted by . Consequently, the (standard) basis
allows specifying the position of an observer via the linear combination:
𝑥1𝒊1 + 𝑥2𝒊2 + 𝑥3𝒊3
(1.1)
where {𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3} are the scalar and real-valued components of the position
vector (i.e., spatial coordinates, in short). Such linear combinations of theCarte-
sianbasisvectorscanberepresentedas1Darraysandwillbefurtherrepresented
by boldface symbols. In particular, the position vector will be denoted by 𝒙and
its components are denoted by 𝑥𝑘for 𝑘∈{1, 2, 3}. A natural extension in this
respect is a Cartesian tensor of rank 2 that can be represented by a 2D array.
Such quantities will be denoted by underlined boldface symbols. An example
from the category is a quantity denoted by 𝜼, for instance, whose components
are 𝜂𝑞,𝑟for 𝑞, 𝑟∈{1, 2, 3}. Consequently, we shall use the following notation
for the products between arrays:

The time coordinate is real-valued and will be denoted by 𝑡. Since we assume
that the sources generating the EM wave ﬁelds are switched on at the origin
𝑡= 0, we will analyze the excited EM ﬁeld quantities in {𝑡∈ℝ; 𝑡> 0} only,
which is possible in virtue of the universal property of causality.
1.1
Laplace Transformation
The one-sided Laplace transformation of a wave quantity 𝑓(𝒙, 𝑡) is deﬁned by
the following integral:
̂𝑓(𝒙, 𝑠) = 𝖫{𝑓(𝒙, 𝑡)} = ∫
∞
𝑡=0
exp(−𝑠𝑡)𝑓(𝒙, 𝑡)d𝑡
(1.9)
In the deﬁnition of Eq. (1.9), we shall limit ourselves to physical wave quantities
that are bounded such that 𝑓(𝒙, 𝑡) = 𝑂[exp(𝑠0𝑡)]1 with 𝑠0 ∈ℝbeing its expo-
nential order . For such functions, the Laplace integral converges if 𝑠is either
real-valued and positive with 𝑠> 𝑠0 or complex-valued with Re(𝑠) > 𝑠0. Ac-
cordingly, the right-half plane Re(𝑠) > 𝑠0 is the domain of regularity of the
causal wave quantity (see Figure 1.2). If Eq. (1.9) is viewed as an integral
equation to be solved for the unknown function 𝑓(𝒙, 𝑡), a natural question
as to its uniqueness arises. The question has been convincingly settled by
Lerch who proved that the image function known along the Lerch sequence
= {𝑠∈ℝ; 𝑠= 𝑠0 + 𝑛ℎ, ℎ> 0, 𝑛= 1, 2, ...} results in one and the same causal
original function. Since single-point discontinuities are of no practical impor-
tance, the ambiguity brought about by null functions may be ignored for our

purposes (see Appendix A). The solution of Eq. (1.9) can be expressed via the
Bromwich inversion integral:
𝑓(𝒙, 𝑡) =
1
2𝜋i ∫𝑠∈𝑟
exp(𝑠𝑡) ̂𝑓(𝒙, 𝑠)d𝑠
(1.10)
where 𝑟= {𝑠∈ℂ; Re(𝑠) = 𝑠0, −∞< Im(𝑠) < ∞} and we have tacitly assumed
that Eq. (1.9) converges absolutely at 𝑠= 𝑠0 (and hence for all Re(𝑠) > 𝑠0). A
special, yet frequently used, case arises for (bounded) functions of exponential
order 𝑠0 = 0 for which the Bromwich integral (1.10) can be rewritten using
the limit 𝑠= 𝛿+ i𝜔as 𝛿↓0, where 𝜔is the (real-valued) angular frequency.
Under this limit, Eqs. (1.9) and (1.10) express the Fourier transform of a causal
wave quantity. For more details about the Laplace transformation, we refer the
reader to Refs. [16,20,47,52].
1.2
Time Convolution
The time convolution between the causal wave quantities 𝑓(𝒙, 𝑡) and 𝑔(𝒙, 𝑡) is
deﬁned as
[𝑓∗𝑔](𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫𝜏∈ℝ
𝑓(𝒙, 𝜏)𝑔(𝒙, 𝑡−𝜏)d𝜏
(1.11)
An important property of the time-convolution operator is its commutativity
allowing to rewrite the latter as
[𝑔∗𝑓](𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫𝜏∈ℝ
𝑓(𝒙, 𝑡−𝜏)𝑔(𝒙, 𝜏)d𝜏
= ∫𝜏∈ℝ
𝑓(𝒙, 𝜏)𝑔(𝒙, 𝑡−𝜏)d𝜏= [𝑓∗𝑔](𝒙, 𝑡)
(1.12)
Applying the Laplace transformation to Eq. (1.11) yields
𝖫{[𝑓∗𝑔](𝒙, 𝑡)} = ̂𝑓(𝒙, 𝑠)̂𝑔(𝒙, 𝑠)
(1.13)
For Eq. (1.13) to make any sense, there must be at least one value of 𝑠for
which the Laplace integrals for ̂𝑓(𝒙, 𝑠) and ̂𝑔(𝒙, 𝑠) do converge simultaneously.
If 𝑓(𝒙, 𝑡) = 𝑂[exp(𝑠0𝑡)] and 𝑔(𝒙, 𝑡) = 𝑂[exp(𝜎0𝑡)], the region of convergence
for Eq. (1.13) is found in the domain extending to the right of max{𝑠0, 𝜎0}
(see Figure 1.3 for 𝜎0 > 𝑠0). Consequently, the right half-plane of the complex
frequency plane Re(𝑠) > max{𝑠0, 𝜎0} is the domain of regularity of the Laplace-
transformed time convolution given in Eq. (1.13).

1.3 Time Correlation

Figure 1.3 Region of convergence of ̂𝑓(𝒙, 𝑠)̂𝑔(𝒙, 𝑠) that is found as the intersection of
Re(𝑠) > 𝑠0 and Re(𝑠) > 𝜎0.
1.3
Time Correlation
The time correlation between the causal wave quantities 𝑓(𝒙, 𝑡) and 𝑔(𝒙, 𝑡) is
deﬁned as
[𝑓⋆𝑔](𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫𝜏∈ℝ
𝑓(𝒙, 𝜏)𝑔(𝒙, 𝜏−𝑡)d𝜏
(1.14)
In contrast to the time-convolution operator, the time-correlation one is not
commutative. Indeed, Eq. (1.14) can be rewritten as
[𝑓⋆𝑔](𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫𝜏∈ℝ
𝑓(𝒙, 𝜏+ 𝑡)𝑔(𝒙, 𝜏)d𝜏
(1.15)
which implies that
[𝑓⋆𝑔](𝒙, 𝑡) = [𝑔⋆𝑓](𝒙, −𝑡)
(1.16)
Also, by inspection of Eqs. (1.11) and (1.14), we may write
[𝑓⋆𝑔](𝒙, 𝑡) = [𝑓∗𝑔⊛](𝒙, 𝑡)d𝜏
(1.17)
where superscript ⊛applied to a space–time ﬁeld quantity represents the time-
reversal operator, that is,
𝑔⊛(𝒙, 𝑡) = 𝑔(𝒙, −𝑡)
(1.18)
Obviously, the time-reversed causal wave quantity has its support in
{𝑡∈ℝ; 𝑡< 0}, which in accordance with Eq. (1.9) implies that the domain
of convergence of its image function extends over a left half of the complex
𝑠-plane. Combination of Eqs. (1.17) and (1.18) with (1.13) and (1.9) then implies
that the Laplace transformation of Eq. (1.14) can be, yetformally only, written as
𝖫{[𝑓⋆𝑔](𝒙, 𝑡)} = ̂𝑓(𝒙, 𝑠)̂𝑔⊛(𝒙, 𝑠)
(1.19)

6
1 Basic Prerequisites
where superscript ⊛applied to a complex frequency domain ﬁeld quantity
represents the following operation:
̂𝑔⊛(𝒙, 𝑠) = ̂𝑔(𝒙, −𝑠)
(1.20)
For Eq. (1.19) to make any sense, there must be at least one value of 𝑠for
which the Laplace integrals for ̂𝑓(𝒙, 𝑠) and ̂𝑔(𝒙, −𝑠) do converge simultaneously.
Again, assuming 𝑓(𝒙, 𝑡) = 𝑂[exp(𝑠0𝑡)] and 𝑔(𝒙, 𝑡) = 𝑂[exp(𝜎0𝑡)], the region of
convergencefor Eq. (1.19) is found as the intersection of the domains of conver-
gence corresponding to ̂𝑓(𝒙, 𝑠) and ̂𝑔(𝒙, −𝑠). Hence, this region of convergence
is at most a strip of the complex frequency plane bounded by two verticals
{𝑠0 < Re(𝑠) < 𝜎0} (see Figure 1.4). In this respect it should be emphasized that
the vast majority of wave ﬁeld quantities we will deal with are bounded func-
tions of exponential order 𝑠0 = 0. For such a class of functions, Eq. (1.19) makes
a sense along the imaginary axis in the complex frequency plane only, that is, in
the limiting real-frequency domain for 𝑠= 𝛿+ i𝜔with 𝛿↓0 and 𝜔∈ℝ. Note
that in such a case, superscript ⊛in Eq. (1.20) has the meaning of complex
conjugate, that is, ̂𝑔⊛(𝒙, i𝜔) = ̂𝑔(𝒙, −i𝜔) since 𝑔(𝒙, 𝑡) is real-valued.
1.4
EM Reciprocity Theorems
In this section, a brief review concerning EM reciprocity theorems is given. In
accordance with Sec. 28 of Ref.[16], we shall distinguish between the reciprocity
theorems of the time-convolution and time-correlation types. The reciprocity
relations will be given in the complex-frequency domain.
To ﬁnd the reciprocity theorems in their generic form, we shall interrelate
two states of EM ﬁelds, say A and B, that are governed by the EM ﬁeld (Maxwell)
equations ([16], Sec. 24.4):

• ̂𝑱A,B = electric current volume density (A∕m2),
• ̂𝑲A,B = magnetic current volume density (V∕m2),
• ̂𝜼A,B = transverse admittance per length of the medium (S∕m),
• ̂𝜻A,B = longitudinal impedance per length of the medium (Ω∕m).
Equations (1.21) and (1.22) are in further supplemented with the constitutive
relations:
̂𝜼A,B(𝒙, 𝑠) = ̂𝝈A,B(𝒙, 𝑠) + 𝑠̂𝝐A,B(𝒙, 𝑠)
(1.23)
̂𝜻A,B(𝒙, 𝑠) = 𝑠̂𝝁A,B(𝒙, 𝑠)
(1.24)
where
• ̂𝝈A,B = electric conductivity (S∕m),
• ̂𝝐A,B = electric permittivity (F∕m), and
• ̂𝝁A,B = magnetic permeability (H∕m).
The medium described by such constitutiverelations can be inhomogeneous,
anisotropic, and dispersive in its EM behavior. A special yet useful case of
Eqs. (1.23) and (1.24) describes an instantaneously reacting (dispersion-free)
medium:
̂𝜼A,B(𝒙, 𝑠) = 𝑠𝝐A,B(𝒙)
(1.25)
̂𝜻A,B(𝒙, 𝑠) = 𝑠𝝁A,B(𝒙)
(1.26)
For isotropic materials the latter relations further simplify to
̂𝜼A,B(𝒙, 𝑠) = 𝑠𝜖A,B(𝒙)𝑰
(1.27)
̂𝜻A,B(𝒙, 𝑠) = 𝑠𝜇A,B(𝒙)𝑰

where 𝑰denotes the 3 × 3 identity matrix.

temporal behavior of the interacting wave ﬁeld quantities has been stressed by
Bojarski [3] who has introduced the time-convolution-and time-correlation-
type reciprocity theorems applying to homogeneous, isotropic, and lossless
media. This has been later clearly uniﬁed by de Hoop [14] who has further
generalized the reciprocity theorems by including general inhomogeneous,
anisotropic, and dispersive media.

Application of the Reciprocity Theorems to an Unbounded Domain
Whenevera reciprocitytheoremis appliedto an unbounded domain exteriorto
an antenna system, the surface integrals thatappear in Eqs. (1.30) and (1.36) will
be carried out over the outer bounding surface 𝜕Δ under the limit Δ →∞(see
Figure 1.5). To evaluate this contribution for causal EM ﬁeld states, we observe
that the EM wave ﬁeld radiated into the homogeneous, isotropic embedding
∞, whose EM properties are described by (real-valued and positive) electric
permittivity 𝜖0 and magnetic permeability 𝜇0, has the form of a spherical wave

(1.41)
as |𝒙| →∞, where { ̂𝑬∞, ̂𝑯∞} are the electric- and magnetic-type amplitude
radiation characteristics, 𝝃= 𝒙∕|𝒙| is the unit vector in the direction of obser-
vation, and 𝑐0 = (𝜖0𝜇0)−1∕2 > 0 is the EM wave speed. Now, making use of the
far-ﬁeld behavior (1.41) in the surface integral of the time-convolution type, we
get

(
̂𝑬A × ̂𝑯B −̂𝑬B × ̂𝑯A)
⋅𝝂d𝐴= 𝑂(Δ−1)
(1.42)
as Δ →∞, since the leading terms in the integrand that are of order Δ−2 cancel
each other. Hence, owing to causality of the interrelated EM wave ﬁelds, the
time-convolution-type surface integral over 𝜕Δ vanishes as Δ →∞. On the
other hand, the time-correlation type of the surface interaction integral leads
to a non-vanishing contribution:

Ω = {𝝃⋅𝝃= 1} deﬁning a unit sphere. Consequently, if the medium exterior
to 0 is source-free, we may, in view of its self-adjointness, write

where we have tacitly taken the limit Δ →∞(see Figure 1.5). In conclusion, the
surface integral contribution from the outer bounding surface 𝜕Δ is vanishing
only for the time-convolution interaction of two causal wave ﬁelds. The time-
correlation interaction results in the nonzero contribution (1.43) that for the
lossless embedding described by two positive scalar constants {𝜖0, 𝜇0} should
be approached via the real-frequency domain (see Section 1.3).
1.5
Description of the Antenna Conﬁguration
We will not limit our further analysis to a particular antenna geometry; instead,
we will take the advantage of the generic antenna model introduced in Ref.
[12], which encompasses all EM antennas used in practice (see Figure 1.6).
The antenna system occupies a bounded domain ⊂ℝ3 that is terminated by
surfaces 0 and 1. Surface 0 separates the antenna system from the exterior
domain denoted by ∞, while surface 1 represents the terminal surface where
the antenna system is accessible via its 𝑁-ports. The maximum diameter of the
domain enclosed by 1 is supposed to be small with respect to the pulse time
width of the excited EM wave ﬁelds. The bounding surfaces 0 and 1 may
partially overlap.
The antenna system consists of a linear and passive media, whose EM prop-
erties can be described by the (tensorial) transverse admittance and the lon-
gitudinal impedance, ̂𝜼= ̂𝜼(𝒙, 𝑠) and ̂𝜻= ̂𝜻(𝒙, 𝑠), respectively (see Eqs. (1.23)
and (1.24)). These constitutive functions are piecewise continuous functions
with respect to the position vector 𝒙, that is, they may show ﬁnite-jump dis-
continuities across bounded interfaces, and, in view of the uniqueness theorem
given in Chapter 2, they are positive deﬁnite tensors of rank 2 for all real and

positive values of 𝑠. The antenna system may also contain perfectly conducting
surfaces. The antenna structure itself is placed in the linear, homogeneous, and
isotropic embedding ∞, whose EM properties are deﬁned via its (real-valued
and positive) electric permittivity 𝜖0 and magnetic permeability 𝜇0.
1.5.1
Antenna Power Conservation
The power-reciprocity theorem in antenna theory [18] calls for the application
of the reciprocity theorem of the time-correlation type to the domain occupied
by the antenna system according to Table 1.3. Taking into account the orien-
tation of the outer normal vector along the bounding surfaces, one may arrive
at

No matter whether the antenna system operates in the transmitting or
receiving state, the volume integrals in Eqs. (1.46) and (1.47) are for
{𝑠= 𝛿+ i𝜔, 𝛿↓0, 𝜔∈ℝ} proportional to the (time-averaged) power dissi-
pated in between the exterior bounding surface 0 and the interface surface
1. In line with Eqs. (1.37) and (1.38), this contribution vanishes whenever the
medium in is time-reverse self-adjoint in its EM behavior. This includes,
in particular, the instantaneously reacting media whose electrical permittivity
and magnetic permeability are symmetrical tensors of rank 2, speciﬁcally
𝝐(𝒙) = 𝝐(𝒙)
(1.48)
𝝁(𝒙) = 𝝁(𝒙)
(1.49)
for all 𝒙∈, as well as (idealized) perfectly electrically conducting (PEC)
antenna models. An important class of antennas in this category is represented
by a wire antenna. For this antenna system, the external surface 0 is formed
by a closed cylindrical surface closely surrounding the PEC arms of the wire
antenna including the (vanishing) volume of the excitation gap. The latter
is enclosed by the cylindrical surface 1 that is at its ends crossed by the
antenna ports. Obviously, in this antenna conﬁguration, the terminal surface
1 partially overlaps with 0 (see Figure 1.7).

1.5.2
Antenna Interface Relations
The EM wave quantities on the terminal surface 1 of the antenna system can
be expressed in terms of its Kirchhoff-type quantities (see Ref. [16], Sec. 30.1).
To illustrate the procedure that leads to such a relation, we shall associate state
(A) from the previous section with the receiving situation (R) in which the
antenna system is externally irradiated by the incident EM wave ﬁelds. Since
the maximum diameter of the domain enclosed by 1 is small with respect
to the pulse time width of the excited ﬁelds, the electric ﬁeld strength ̂𝑬R
can be expressed as (the opposite of) the gradient of the scalar potential ̂𝜙R.
Consequently, the surface integral over 1 from Eq. (1.46) can be written as

dominated by the conduction current ﬂowing in the perfect conductors of the
𝑁-port termination and that these electric currents are in the receiving state

we have chosen a reference point where the scalar potential ̂𝜙R has the value

Antenna Uniqueness Theorem
The main purpose of this chapter is to determine what conditions lead, for
a given antenna excitation, to only one and the same (causal) radiated EM
wave ﬁeld. The standard procedure to solve the problem is based on the time-
domain Poynting’s theorem ([39], Sec. 9.2). For the general type of dispersive
media constituting the analyzed antenna system (see Section 1.5), however, this
way is not generally applicable. An elegant remedy of this situation has been
suggested by de Hoop [17], whose proof relies on Lerch’s uniqueness theorem
for the one-sided Laplace transformation with the real-valued and positive
parameter 𝑠. Following the lines of reasoning introduced in Ref. [17], it will
be next demonstrated that the transmitting antenna problem has the unique
solution provided that the antenna constitutive parametersare positive deﬁnite
tensors for all real and positive values of 𝑠.
2.1
Problem Description
We shall analyze the 𝑁-port antenna system that is excited by electric current
pulses 𝐼T
𝑛= 𝐼T
𝑛(𝑡) at its accessible ports (see Figure 2.1). Namely, under
the assumption that one and the same antenna excitation, 𝐼T
𝑛= 𝐼̃T
𝑛for all
𝑛∈{1, ..., 𝑁}, activates two distinct EM wave ﬁelds {𝑬T, 𝑯T} and {𝑬̃T, 𝑯̃T},
we will determine the conditions that lead to the contradiction.
2.2
Problem Solution
The EM wave ﬁelds radiated by the transmitting antenna system in states (T)
and (̃T) are governed by the EM ﬁeld equations (cf. Eqs. (1.21) and (1.22))
𝛁× ̂𝑯T, ̃T −̂𝜼⋅̂𝑬T, ̃T = 𝟎

for 𝒙∈, where ̂𝜼and ̂𝜻are the transverse admittance and the longitudinal
impedance (per length of the medium) describing the EM properties of the
medium in the bounded domain occupied by the antenna system(see Eqs. (1.23)
and (1.24)). The antenna system then radiates into the embedding where the
transmitted EM ﬁelds satisfy the source-free EM wave equations:
𝛁× ̂𝑯T, ̃T −𝑠𝜖0 ̂𝑬T, ̃T = 𝟎
(2.3)
𝛁× ̂𝑬T, ̃T + 𝑠𝜇0 ̂𝑯T, ̃T = 𝟎
(2.4)
for 𝒙∈∞. In virtue of causality, the radiated EM wave ﬁeld quantities
are bounded as |𝒙| →∞. The decisive point in a proof of uniqueness is the
demonstration that the corresponding homogeneous problem does not possess
a nonidentically vanishing solution. To this end, we deﬁne the ﬁeld difference:
{
Δ ̂𝑬T, Δ ̂𝑯T}
(𝒙, 𝑠) ≜
{ ̂𝑬̃T −̂𝑬T, ̂𝑯̃T −̂𝑯T}
(𝒙, 𝑠)
(2.5)

ﬁeld (namely, Eqs. (2.1)–(2.4)) in both states. Next, combining the ﬁeld
equations in the antenna domain, one ﬁnds

Now it is observed that the left-hand side of Eq. (2.9) is along Lerch’s sequence
= {𝑠∈ℝ; 𝑠= 𝑠0 + 𝑛ℎ, ℎ> 0, 𝑛= 1, 2, ...} real-valued and positive for any
non identicallyvanishing Δ ̂𝑬T and Δ ̂𝑯T. As long as ̂𝜼and ̂𝜻are positive deﬁnite
tensors of rank 2 for all 𝒙∈and 𝑠∈, Eq. (2.9) leads to a contradiction
unless Δ ̂𝑬T = 0 and Δ ̂𝑯T = 0 for all 𝒙∈∪∞. The latter thus implies the
unique solution:
{ ̂𝑬T, ̂𝑯T}(𝒙, 𝑠) = { ̂𝑬̃T, ̂𝑯̃T}(𝒙, 𝑠)
(2.10)
throughout the problem conﬁguration, that is, for all 𝒙∈∪∞and 𝑠∈.
The Lerch uniqueness theorem for the one-sided Laplace transformation then
offers the possibility of rewriting Eq. (2.10) in terms of the corresponding
causal wave ﬁelds
{𝑬T, 𝑯T}(𝒙, 𝑡) = {𝑬̃T, 𝑯̃T}(𝒙, 𝑡)
(2.11)
for all 𝒙∈∪∞and 𝑡> 0. In conclusion, it has been shown that there is only
one and the same (causal) radiated EM wave ﬁeld in the problem conﬁguration
provided that the constitutive relaxation functions describing the EM behavior
of the antenna system are positive deﬁnite tensors of rank 2 along the Lerch
sequence (and hence along the real positive axis {𝑠∈ℝ; 𝑠> 𝑠0}).

Forward-Scattering Theorem in Antenna Theory

Problem Description
In this chapter, we shall discuss the forward-scattering theorem concerning
the 𝑁-port receiving antenna system shown in Figure 3.1. The antenna system
is placed in the linear, homogeneous, and isotropic embedding whose EM
properties are described by real-valued and positive constants 𝜖0 and 𝜇0.
The antenna system under consideration is irradiated by the uniform EM
plane wave, namely,
̂𝑬i(𝒙, 𝑠) = 𝜶̂𝑒i(𝑠) exp(−𝑠𝜷⋅𝒙∕𝑐0)
(3.1)
̂𝑯i(𝒙, 𝑠) = (𝜷× 𝜶) 𝜂0 ̂𝑒i(𝑠) exp(−𝑠𝜷⋅𝒙∕𝑐0)
(3.2)
where 𝜶is a unit vector in the direction of polarization, 𝜷is a unit vector
in the direction of propagation, 𝑐0 = (𝜖0𝜇0)−1∕2 is the EM wave speed, and
𝜂0 = (𝜖0∕𝜇0)1∕2 is the EM wave admittance.
3.2
Problem Solution
The presence of the antenna system is accounted for via the scattered EM
wave ﬁeld that is deﬁned as the difference between the total EM ﬁeld in the
conﬁguration, { ̂𝑬R, ̂𝑯R}, and the incident ﬁeld, that is,
{ ̂𝑬s, ̂𝑯s}(𝒙, 𝑠) ≜{ ̂𝑬R, ̂𝑯R}(𝒙, 𝑠) −{ ̂𝑬i, ̂𝑯i}(𝒙, 𝑠)
(3.3)
Accordingly, the incident ﬁeld can be interpreted as the EM ﬁeld that would
exist in the problem conﬁguration if there were no antenna system. The scat-
tered ﬁeld admits the far-ﬁeld representation for causal EM wave ﬁelds ([16],
Sec. 26.11):
{ ̂𝑬s, ̂𝑯s}(𝒙, 𝑠) = { ̂𝑬s;∞, ̂𝑯s;∞}(𝝃, 𝑠)exp(−𝑠|𝒙|∕𝑐0)(4𝜋|𝒙|)−1
× [1 + 𝑂(|𝒙|−1)]

Making use of Eq. (3.3), it is observed that
̂𝑬i⊛× ̂𝑯s + ̂𝑬s × ̂𝑯i⊛+ ̂𝑬i × ̂𝑯s⊛+ ̂𝑬s⊛× ̂𝑯i

being the quantities that in the limit 𝑠= 𝛿+ i𝜔, 𝛿↓0, are proportional1 to
the (time-averaged) total power absorbed and scattered by the antenna system,
respectively. Also, thanks to thetime-reverse self-adjointness of the embedding,
we have
∫𝒙∈0
(
̂𝑬i × ̂𝑯i⊛+ ̂𝑬i⊛× ̂𝑯i)
⋅𝝂d𝐴= 0
(3.11)
Hence, upon combining Eqs. (3.6)–(3.11), we arrive at the desired relation:
̂𝑃a(𝑠) + ̂𝑃s(𝑠)
= 1

[̂𝑒i(𝑠) 𝜶⋅̂𝑬s;∞(𝜷, −𝑠) −̂𝑒i(−𝑠) 𝜶⋅̂𝑬s;∞(𝜷, 𝑠)]∕𝑠𝜇0
(3.12)
which is the general form of the forward-scattering theorem in the complex-
frequency domain. The theorem relates the sum of the scattered and absorbed
power by the receiving antenna system to the scattered far-ﬁeld amplitude
observed in the direction of propagation of the incident plane wave (i.e., in the
forward direction).
The terms on the left-hand side of Eq. (3.12) can be further elaborated
(see also Exercises in Chapter 9). To this end, the reciprocity theorem of
the time-correlation type is ﬁrst applied to the domain enclosed by 0 and
1 and to the total ﬁeld states (see Table 3.1). Making use of Eq. (1.36), this
yields

Antenna Matching Theorems
The maximum power transfer theorem in antenna theory is a corollary of
the property of antenna self-reciprocity that makes possible to represent a
receiving antenna system as a Kirchhoff-type equivalent network. This will be
rigorously justiﬁed in Chapter 5 for an 𝑁-port antenna system with the aid of
the reciprocity theorem of the time-convolution type applied to one and the
same antenna system operating either as a transmitter or as a receiver (see Refs
[12,19]). A classic result in this respect,known as the matching condition, states
that for a given radiation 𝑁× 𝑁matrix impedance ̂𝒁T(𝑠), the (time-averaged)
power dissipated in the antenna load is maximized whenever the impedance
𝑁× 𝑁matrix of the load ̂𝒁L(𝑠) is “matched” according to
̂𝒁L(i𝜔) = ̂𝒁T⊛(i𝜔)
(4.1)
for all 𝜔∈ℝof interest. Hence, the maximum power transfer is achieved if the
impedance matrix of the load is complex conjugate to the corresponding radi-
ation matrix impedance. Now, realizing the fact that the reciprocity theorem
makes possible to couple the (local) Kirchhoff quantities of the antenna equiv-
alent circuit to (global) EM wave ﬁeld quantities in the antenna embedding, an
interesting question arises what is the global-type counterpart of the matching
condition (4.1). Introducing such a global-type matching condition for a class
of reciprocal antennas is exactly the main purpose of this chapter.

Reciprocity Analysis of the Time-Correlation Type
The transmitting and receiving situations of an 𝑁-port antenna system (see
Figure 4.1) are mutually interrelated using the reciprocity theorem of the time-
correlation type.

impedance and admittance radiation matrices arises when the medium in 
is self-adjoint in its EM properties. To demonstrate this property, the reci-
procity theorem of the time-convolution type is applied to domain and to
two transmitting ﬁeld states, say (T) and (̃T), whose material states are each

4.1.2
Receiving State
The 𝑁-port antenna system is in its receiving state irradiated by the uniform
EM plane wave:
̂𝑬i(𝒙, 𝑠) = 𝜶̂𝑒i(𝑠) exp(−𝑠𝜷⋅𝒙∕𝑐0)
(3.1 revisited)
̂𝑯i(𝒙, 𝑠) = (𝜷× 𝜶) 𝜂0 ̂𝑒i(𝑠) exp(−𝑠𝜷⋅𝒙∕𝑐0)
(3.2 revisited)
In a standard way, we next introduce the scattered EM wave ﬁeld that accounts
for the presence of the receiving antenna system as the difference between
the total EM ﬁeld in the conﬁguration, { ̂𝑬R, ̂𝑯R}, and the incident wave ﬁeld,
namely
{ ̂𝑬s, ̂𝑯s}(𝒙, 𝑠) ≜{ ̂𝑬R, ̂𝑯R}(𝒙, 𝑠) −{ ̂𝑬i, ̂𝑯i}(𝒙, 𝑠)
(3.3 revisited)
The scatteredﬁeld is causal and hence has, far enough from the antenna system,
the form of a spherical wave expanding away from the origin, with { ̂𝑬s;∞, ̂𝑯s;∞}
being its far-ﬁeld amplitudes (see Eq. (3.4)). Consequently, the induced voltage
across the port of the receiving antenna system can be expressed as
̂𝑉R
𝑚(𝑠) =
𝑁
∑
𝑛=1
̂𝑍L
𝑚,𝑛(𝑠) ̂𝐼R
𝑛(𝑠)
(4.12)
for 𝑚= {1, … , 𝑁}, where ̂𝑍L
𝑚,𝑛(𝑠) is the impedance matrix of the antenna load.
Equivalently, we may write

𝑛(𝑠) =

𝑛,𝑚(𝑠) ̂𝑉R

(4.13)
for 𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}, using the admittance matrix of the antenna load ̂𝑌L
𝑛,𝑚(𝑠).
Combination of Eqs. (4.12) and (4.13) implies that the impedance and admit-
tance matrices of the antenna load are each other’s inverse. Accordingly, these

load matrices are interrelated in the same way as the radiation impedance and
admittance matrices (see Eqs. (4.4) and (4.5)).
4.1.3
Equivalent Matching Condition
In our efforts to ﬁnd the global-type counterpart of the classic (conjugate)
matching condition (4.1), we start with the combination of Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2)
and (4.11) that yields
∫𝒙∈0

̂𝑬i × ̂𝑯T⊛+ ̂𝑬T⊛× ̂𝑯i)
⋅𝝂d𝐴
= −̂𝑒i(𝑠) 𝜶⋅̂𝑬T;∞(𝜷, −𝑠)∕𝑠𝜇0
(4.14)
In the next step, we will apply the reciprocity theorem of the time-correlation
type to the domain exterior to the antenna system and to the scattered and
transmitted EM wave ﬁelds (see Table 4.2). Owing to the fact that both of these
wave ﬁelds are causal, we can directly make use of (1.45) and write
∫𝒙∈0
(
̂𝑬s × ̂𝑯T⊛+ ̂𝑬T⊛× ̂𝑯s)

(4.15)
The sum of Eqs. (4.14) and (4.15) along with Eq. (3.3) results in the following
reciprocity relation:

̂𝑬R × ̂𝑯T⊛+ ̂𝑬T⊛× ̂𝑯R)

the antenna system is reciprocal in its EM behavior (see Eq. (4.9)). This, with
regard to Eq. (4.19), implies that the matching condition (4.1) is for reciprocal
antennas equivalent to stating that

• Verify the validity of the global-type matching condition for a short
wire carrying a uniform electric current.
Hint: Start from the surface integral representation for the scattered ﬁeld
(3.5), apply the explicit-type boundary condition on the PEC surface of the wire
dipole, and take the limit 𝑠↓0. In this way, the electric dipole contribution to
the scattering tensor ̂𝑺can be expressed as
̂𝑺E(𝝃|𝜷, 𝑠) = −(𝑠2∕𝑐2
0)(𝑰−𝝃𝝃) ⋅̂𝜶E ⋅(𝑰−𝜷𝜷)
in which ̂𝜶E is the electric polarizability tensor that is related to the electric
dipole moment via
̂𝒑(𝑠) = 𝜖0 ̂𝑒i(𝑠) ̂𝜶E ⋅𝜶
Subsequently, express the electric dipole moment in terms of the induced
electric current ﬂowing across the antenna load, that is,
̂𝒑(𝑠) = −𝑠−1 ̂𝐼R(𝑠) 𝓵
where 𝓵is the vectorial length of the wire. The electric current ̂𝐼R can be
found with the aid of Th́evenin’s equivalent representation of a 1-port antenna
system. The open-circuit voltage generator for the incident plane wave can be
expressed in closed form ([18], Eq. (56))
̂𝑉G(𝑠) = ̂𝑒i(𝑠)𝜶⋅̂𝑬T;∞(−𝜷, 𝑠)∕𝑠𝜇0 ̂𝐼T(𝑠)
where the radiation amplitude of a conducting wire carrying a uniform electric
current distribution is given as
̂𝑬T;∞(𝝃, 𝑠) = 𝑠𝜇0 ̂𝐼T(𝑠)(𝝃𝝃−𝑰) ⋅𝓵
and the corresponding effective length follows (see Eq. (4.23)):
̂𝓵T;I(𝝃, 𝑠) = (𝝃𝝃−𝑰) ⋅𝓵
Hence, upon collecting the results, the polarizability tensor of theelectric dipole
can be expressed as
̂𝜶E = (𝑠𝜖0)−1( ̂𝑍T + ̂𝑍L)−1 𝓵𝓵

4.1 Reciprocity Analysis of the Time-Correlation Type

where we have used ̂𝐼R = ̂𝑉G∕( ̂𝑍T + ̂𝑍L). Knowing the polarizability tensor,
the corresponding scattering tensor follows:
̂𝑺E(𝝃|𝜷, 𝑠) = −𝑠𝜇0( ̂𝑍T + ̂𝑍L)−1[(𝑰−𝝃𝝃) ⋅𝓵][𝓵⋅(𝑰−𝜷𝜷)]
With the expressions for the scattering tensor and the effective length at our
disposal, we may evaluate the integral in Eq. (4.24) and get
∫𝝃∈Ω
̂𝓵T;I(𝝃, −𝑠) ⋅̂𝑺E(𝝃|𝜷, 𝑠) ⋅𝜶dΩ = 8𝜋

𝑠𝜇0𝓁2
̂𝑍T + ̂𝑍L 𝜶⋅𝓵
(4.25)
where 𝓁= |𝓵| is the length of the wire. Substitution of the results in the global-
type matching condition (4.24) results in
̂𝑍T(𝑠) + ̂𝑍L(𝑠) = −𝑠2𝜇0𝓁2∕3𝜋𝑐0
(4.26)
where we have used 𝜶⋅̂𝓵T;I(𝜷, −𝑠) = −𝜶⋅𝓵(see also Exercises in Chapter 9).
The last equality becomes more transparent in the real-FD under the limit
{𝑠= 𝛿+ i𝜔, 𝛿↓0, 𝜔∈ℝ}, that is,
̂𝑍T(i𝜔) + ̂𝑍L(i𝜔) = (𝜇0∕𝜖0)1∕2(4𝜋∕3)(𝓁∕𝜆)2
(4.27)
where 𝜆= 2𝜋𝑐0∕𝜔∈ℝwith 𝑐0 = (𝜖0𝜇0)−1∕2. The right-hand side of the last
equation can be identiﬁed with the radiation resistance ([30], Sec. 4.4a, Eq. (10))
of a short-wire antenna and we get
̂𝑍T(i𝜔) + ̂𝑍L(i𝜔) = 2Re[ ̂𝑍T(i𝜔)]
(4.28)
which is obviously satisﬁed when the classic (conjugate) matching condition
(4.1) applies.
• Verify the validity of the global-type matching condition for a small
loop carrying a uniform electric current.
Hint: The solution follows the lines of reasoning from the previous example.
At ﬁrst, express the magnetic dipole contribution to the scattering tensor ̂𝑺as
̂𝑺H(𝝃|𝜷, 𝑠) = (𝑠2∕𝑐2
0) 𝝃× ̂𝜶H × 𝜷
in which ̂𝜶H is the magnetic polarizability tensor that is related to the magnetic
dipole moment via
̂𝒎(𝑠) = (𝜖0∕𝜇0)1∕2 ̂𝑒i(𝑠) ̂𝜶H ⋅(𝜷× 𝜶)

40
4 Antenna Matching Theorems
Subsequently, express the magnetic dipole moment in terms of the induced
electric current ﬂowing across the antenna load, speciﬁcally
̂𝒎(𝑠) = −̂𝐼R(𝑠) 
where is the vectorial area of the loop. As in the previous example, the
electric current in the load is found using the reciprocity-based expression for
the voltage generator in Th́evenin’s circuit representation ([18], Eq. (56)). In
this expression, use the radiation characteristics of a conducting loop carrying
a uniform electric current distribution, namely,
̂𝑬T;∞(𝝃, 𝑠) = 𝜇0𝑐−1
0 𝑠2 ̂𝐼T(𝑠) 𝝃× 
and the corresponding effective length follows (see Eq. (4.23)):
̂𝓵T;I(𝝃, 𝑠) = 𝑠𝑐−1
0 𝝃× 
Hence, upon collecting the results, the polarizability tensor of the magnetic
dipole can be expressed as
̂𝜶H = −𝑠𝜇0( ̂𝑍T + ̂𝑍L)−1 
where we have used, again, ̂𝐼R = ̂𝑉G∕( ̂𝑍T + ̂𝑍L). Knowing the polarizability
tensor, the corresponding scattering tensor follows:
̂𝑺H(𝝃|𝜷, 𝑠) = (𝑠2∕𝑐2
0)𝑠𝜇0( ̂𝑍T + ̂𝑍L)−1(𝝃× )(𝜷× )
With the expressions for the scattering tensor and the effective length at our
disposal, we may evaluate the integral in Eq. (4.24) and get
∫𝝃∈Ω
̂𝓵T;I(𝝃, −𝑠) ⋅̂𝑺H(𝝃|𝜷, 𝑠) ⋅𝜶dΩ

global-type matching condition (4.24) results in
̂𝑍T(𝑠) + ̂𝑍L(𝑠) = 𝑠4𝜇02∕3𝜋𝑐3
0
(4.30)
Again, the limit {𝑠= 𝛿+ i𝜔, 𝛿↓0, 𝜔∈ℝ} reveals
̂𝑍T(i𝜔) + ̂𝑍L(i𝜔) = (𝜇0∕𝜖0)1∕2(16𝜋5∕3)(𝑟∕𝜆)2
(4.31)
The right-hand side of the latter is twice the radiation resistance of a small
current loop ([21], Sec. 2.6, Eq. (2.33)), which proves the validity of the global-
type matching condition Eq. (4.24) for the small-loop antenna.

Equivalent Kirchhoff Network Representations of a
Receiving Antenna System
The reciprocity relation between the transmit and receive antenna patterns is
among the most famous properties in antenna theory. Another closely related
consequence of EM reciprocity is the equivalent circuit representation of a
receiving antenna system. In this chapter, therefore, the reciprocity theorem of
the time-convolution type is systematically applied to construct Kirchhoff-type
equivalent network representations of an 𝑁-port receiving antenna system. In
accordance with Ref. [11], the Lorentz reciprocity theorem is applied to one
and the same antenna system operating either in its transmitting or receiving
state. The resulting (self-)reciprocity relation immediately offers the descrip-
tion for both the internal Th́evenin-voltage and Norton-current generators.
Closed-form expressions describing the internal generators are given for the
antenna excitation via a plane wave and via a given volume current distribution.
The description that follows is largely based on a seminal paper by de Hoop
et al. [19], where the reciprocity analysis is carried out entirely in the time
domain.
5.1
Reciprocity Analysis of the Time-Convolution Type
The transmitting and receiving situations of an 𝑁-port antenna system (see
Figure 4.1) are mutually interrelated using the reciprocity theorem of the time-
convolution type. The internal source strengths of the Kirchhoff equivalent
networks are speciﬁed for both the EM plane-wave incidence and the known
volume-source distribution.

(5.1)
Subsequently, the reciprocity theorem of the time-convolution type is applied
to the unbounded domain exterior to the antenna system and to the scattered
ﬁeld and transmitted ﬁeld states (see Table 5.1). Since both interrelated ﬁeld
states are causal, we may directly apply (1.44) and write
∫𝒙∈0
(
̂𝑬s × ̂𝑯T −̂𝑬T × ̂𝑯s)
⋅𝝂d𝐴= 0

0𝑠−2 ̂𝜂L(𝑠)̂𝜂P(−𝜷, 𝑠) ̂𝐺(−𝜷, 𝑠)
that relates the absorption cross section of the load in the receiving state to
the antenna gain in the corresponding transmitting situation. Thanks to the
property
(4𝜋)−1
∫𝝃∈Ω
̂𝐷(𝝃, 𝑠)dΩ = 1

50
5 Equivalent Kirchhoff Network Representations of a Receiving Antenna System
and {0 ≤̂𝜂P ≤1}, it is interesting to note that for the average absorption cross
section of the load the following inequality applies:
(4𝜋)−1
∫𝝃∈Ω
̂𝜎L(𝝃, 𝑠)dΩ ≤−𝜋𝑐2
0𝑠−2 ̂𝜂L(𝑠)̂𝜂T(𝑠)
Accordingly, for a loss-free antenna whose load and polarization are perfectly
“matched,” the average cross section of the load equals to −𝜋𝑐2
0𝑠−2, which for
𝑠= i𝜔corresponds to 𝜆2
0∕4𝜋, where 𝜆0 is the corresponding wavelength. For
more details on the subject, we refer the reader to Ref. [18].

The Antenna System in the Presence of a Scatterer
In real-life scenarios, antenna systems do operate in the vicinity of objects that
may electromagnetically couple to these systems and thus change their EM
characteristics. From this reason, it is of high practical importance to have a
description of the impact of an object on the antenna behavior that will make
possible to quantitatively assess potential consequences with regard to EM
interference and EM susceptibility aspects. This is exactly the main objective
of this chapter, where the relevant reciprocity analysis is carried out.
6.1
Receiving Antenna in the Presence of a Scatterer
In this section, we shall analyze two receiving situations differing from each
other in the presence of a scatterer that is located in the antenna embedding
(see Figure 6.1). The scatterer occupies domain whose bounding surface is
denoted by 𝜕. The receiving antenna system is in both receiving scenarios,
say (R) and (̃R), excited either by the uniform plane wave
̂𝑬i(𝒙, 𝑠) = 𝜶̂𝑒i(𝑠) exp(−𝑠𝜷⋅𝒙∕𝑐0)
(3.1 revisited)
̂𝑯i(𝒙, 𝑠) = (𝜷× 𝜶) 𝜂0 ̂𝑒i(𝑠) exp(−𝑠𝜷⋅𝒙∕𝑐0)
(3.2 revisited)
or by a deﬁned volume source distribution generating the incident EM wave
ﬁeld { ̂𝑬i, ̂𝑯i}(𝒙, 𝑠). As a consequence of the scatterer in scenario (̃R), the
scattered EM wave ﬁelds in the conﬁgurations are different and we may hence
deﬁne their difference, namely
{Δ ̂𝑬s, Δ ̂𝑯s}(𝒙, 𝑠) ≜{ ̂𝑬̃s −̂𝑬s, ̂𝑯̃s −̂𝑯s}(𝒙, 𝑠)
(6.1)
Since the incident EM wave ﬁeld remains the same, the change in the scattered
ﬁeld equals to the change in the total ﬁeld, that is,
{Δ ̂𝑬R, Δ ̂𝑯R}(𝒙, 𝑠) ≜{ ̂𝑬̃R −̂𝑬R, ̂𝑯̃R −̂𝑯R}(𝒙, 𝑠)
= {Δ ̂𝑬s, Δ ̂𝑯s}(𝒙, 𝑠)

6 The Antenna System in the Presence of a Scatterer
Figure 6.1 Receiving situations differing from each other in the presence of a scatterer.
The corresponding EM ﬁeld states will be denoted by (Δs) and (ΔR). In order
to describe the resulting change in the strength of internal generators of the
Kirchhoff-type equivalent circuits, the receiving states shown in Figure 6.1
will be interrelated with the corresponding transmitting situation without the
scatterer (see state (T) in Figure 4.1). Accordingly, we start with applying the
reciprocity theorem of the time-convolution type to the unbounded domain
exterior to the antenna system and the scattererand to the ﬁeld-differencestate
(ΔR) and the transmitting state (T) (see Table 6.1). Since both ﬁelds are causal
and source-free outside 0 ∪𝜕, we can make use of the conclusions drawn in
Section 1.4.3 and get
∫𝒙∈0∪𝜕
(
Δ ̂𝑬R × ̂𝑯T −̂𝑬T × Δ ̂𝑯R)
⋅𝝂d𝐴= 0
(6.3)
In the following step, the reciprocity of the time-convolution type is applied to
the total ﬁelds in states (R) and (T) and to the domain occupied by the scatterer
(see Table 6.2). Since these ﬁeld states are source-free here and since the
embedding is self-adjoint in its EM properties, we will end up with the zero
contribution from the relevant surface integral over the bounding surface of
the scatterer, that is,
∫𝒙∈𝜕
(
̂𝑬R × ̂𝑯T −̂𝑬T × ̂𝑯R)
⋅𝝂d𝐴= 0

The right-hand side of the latter can be further speciﬁed. For EM-penetrable
scatterers whose EM properties are described by the (tensorial) transverse
admittance and the longitudinal impedance, ̂𝜼s = ̂𝜼s(𝒙, 𝑠) and ̂𝜻s = ̂𝜻s(𝒙, 𝑠) (see
Eqs. (1.23) and (1.24)), respectively, the application of the reciprocity theorem
of the time-convolution type according to Table 6.3 leads to

(6.10)
lim
𝛿↓0 𝝂× ̂𝑯̃R(𝒙+ 𝛿𝝂, 𝑠) = 𝟎
(6.11)
for 𝒙∈𝜕, respectively. Equations (6.6)–(6.11) will next serve as the start-
ing point for expressing the change of source strength of the Kirchhoff-type
equivalent circuits.

Th´evenin’s Network
The change in the voltage-source strengths of the equivalent Th́evenin circuit

Δ ̂𝑉G
𝑚(𝑠) ≜̂𝑉̃G

with Eq. (5.16), the change in the voltage-source strength follows:

(6.14)
for 𝑚= {1, … , 𝑁}. Also, making use of the boundary conditions (6.10) and
(6.11), one may express the change as
Δ ̂𝑉G
𝑚(𝑠) = −∫𝒙∈𝜕
̂𝒆T;I
𝑚⋅𝜕̂𝑱̃R d𝐴

(6.17)
𝜕̂𝑲̃R(𝒙, 𝑠) ≜̂𝑬̃R(𝒙, 𝑠) × 𝝂(𝒙)
(6.18)
where surface 𝜕is approached from its exterior. A special form of Eq. (6.14)
under the ﬁrst-order Rayleigh–Gans–Born approximation ([16], Sec. 29.5) has
been previously applied to evaluate the effect of EM scattering from raindrops
to EM wave propagation ([9], Sec. 6.8).

Similar to the previous section, we start with the deﬁnition of the change in the
electric current-source strength of the Norton circuit generators

(6.19)
for 𝑚= {1, … , 𝑁}, where ̂𝐼̃G
𝑚and ̂𝐼G
𝑚are short-circuit electric currents that
apply to the case with and without the scatterer, respectively. Consequently,
making use of Eq. (5.12) in Eq. (6.6) along with Eq. (5.18), the change in the
current-source strength follows:
Δ ̂𝐼G
𝑚(𝑠) = ∫𝒙∈𝜕

(6.21)
Finally, making use of the boundary conditions (6.10) and (6.11), one may
express the change as

6.2
Transmitting Antenna in the Presence of a Scatterer
In this section, we shall describe the impact of a scatterer on the matrix of
the antenna radiation impedance (see Eq. (4.2)). To this end, we will mutually
interrelate two transmitting states depicted in Figure 6.2. Here, two 𝑁-port
transmitting antenna systems are excited at their accessible ports by either
electric currents 𝐼T
𝑛(𝑡) or voltages 𝑉T
𝑛(𝑡). The way of excitation is identical in
both scenarios. Thanks to the presence of the scatterer whose EM properties
differ from those of the embedding, the total radiated ﬁelds in the transmitting
situations are different. This difference is expressed as

(̃T) and (ΔT).
6.2.1
Analysis Based on the Reciprocity Theorem of the Time-Convolution
Type
The reciprocity analysis starts by applying the reciprocity theorem of the time-
convolution type to the unbounded domain exterior to the antenna system and
the scatterer and to the ﬁeld-difference state (ΔT) and the transmitting state
(T) in absence of the scatterer (see Table 6.4). In this way, making use of the
conclusions drawn in Section 1.4.3, we end up with

Analysis Based on the Reciprocity Theorem of the Time-Correlation Type
The present reciprocity analysis based on the reciprocity theorem of the
time-correlation type partly follows the lines of the previous Section 6.2.1.
Accordingly, we start with applying the reciprocity theorem to the unbounded
domain exterior to the transmitting antenna system and to (ΔT) and (T) states
(see Table 6.5).

60
6 The Antenna System in the Presence of a Scatterer
Table 6.6 Application of the reciprocity theorem.
Since both ﬁeld states are causal, we may apply the expression similar to
Eq. (1.45) and get

In the following step, the reciprocity of the time-correlation type is applied
to the bounded domain and, again, to (ΔT) and (T) states (see Table 6.6).
Using the generic form of the reciprocity theorem (1.36), we get the following
relation:
∫𝒙∈0
(
Δ ̂𝑬T × ̂𝑯T⊛+ ̂𝑬T⊛× Δ ̂𝑯T)

Here, the volume integral vanishes for the medium that is time-reverse self-
adjoint in its EM properties (see Eqs. (1.37) and (1.38)). This includes loss-
free antenna systems such as instantaneously reacting antennas described
with symmetric tensors of electric permittivity and magnetic permeability
(see Eqs. (1.48)–(1.49)), antenna systems made from PEC components (e.g.,
Figure 1.7), or, eventually, the combination of these cases. Furthermore, the
surface integral over the terminal surface of the antenna system can be ex-
pressed in terms of Kirchhoff quantities, namely

where we have used the fact that the excitation electric current is oriented
along the outer unit normal vector 𝝂on the terminal surface 1. Subsequently,
the reciprocity theorem of the time-correlation type is applied to the domain
occupied by the scatterer and to one and the same state (T) (see Table 6.7
and Figure 6.2). Owing to the fact that state (T) is in source-free and that the
embedding is self-adjoint in its EM properties, we get
∫𝒙∈𝜕
(
̂𝑬T × ̂𝑯T⊛+ ̂𝑬T⊛× ̂𝑯T)
⋅𝝂d𝐴= 0
(6.35)
In the ﬁnal step, Eqs. (6.32)–(6.35) are combined together, which in view of
Eq. (6.24) yields the desired reciprocity relation:

In deriving the latter relation, we have assumed that the volume integral in
Eq. (6.33) approaches zero, which applies to loss-free antenna systems. Equa-
tion (6.36) can be viewed as the time-correlation counterpart of the time-
convolution reciprocity relation (6.27).

Exercise
• Give an approximate expression for the contribution of a small spher-
ical raindrop to the Th́evenin voltage-source strength of a short-wire
antenna (see Fig. 6.3). For simplicity, let us assume that the raindrop
is located in the far-ﬁeld region of the antenna.
Hint: Use Eqs. (6.14) and (6.8) with Eq. (5.16) for 𝑁= 1 to express the change
of the Th́evenin voltage-source strength in terms of the equivalent contrast
electric current volume density:
Δ ̂𝑉G(𝑠) = −∫𝒙∈
̂𝒆T;I ⋅̂𝑱̃Rd𝑉
where is a spherical domain deﬁned by the location of its center and by its
(relativelysmall) radius 𝜚> 0. Now, under the assumption that the sensing ﬁeld
̂𝒆T;I is uniform over , we write
Δ ̂𝑉G(𝑠) ≃−̂𝒆T;I ⋅∫𝒙∈
̂𝑱̃Rd𝑉
where the volume integral of the contrast electric current density is associated
with 𝑠̂𝒑through the electric dipole moment ̂𝒑. The latter is, in virtue of the
Born-like approximation, expressed as
̂𝒑
𝖡≃𝜖0 ̂𝐼T(𝑠) ̂𝜶E ⋅̂𝒆T;I
using the polarizability tensor of the electric type, ̂𝜶E, for which we use the
static-ﬁeld approximation applying to a homogeneous dielectric sphere ([46],
Eq. (3.126)):
̂𝜶E = 4𝜋𝜚3[(𝜖r −1)∕(𝜖r + 2)]𝑰
where 𝜖r is its relative permittivity. Accordingly, we then write
Δ ̂𝑉G(𝑠) ≃−𝑠𝜖0 ̂𝐼T(𝑠) ̂𝒆T;I ⋅̂𝜶E ⋅̂𝒆T;I
= −4𝜋𝑠𝜖0 ̂𝐼T(𝑠) 𝜚3[(𝜖r −1)∕(𝜖r + 2)]̂𝒆T;I ⋅̂𝒆T;I
(6.41)
The radiated-ﬁeld EM ﬁeld constituents admit the far-ﬁeld expansion that can
be expressed as (see Eqs. (4.10) with (4.23) and (5.16))
̂𝒆T;I = 𝑠𝜇0 ̂𝓵T;I exp(−𝑠|𝒙|∕𝑐0)(4𝜋|𝒙|)−1[1 + 𝑂(|𝒙|−1)]

distribution reads
̂𝓵T;I(𝝃, 𝑠) = (𝝃𝝃−𝑰) ⋅𝓵
in which 𝓵is the vectorial length of the wire. Finally, after collecting the results,
we end up with

(6.43)
where 𝓁= |𝓵| is the length of the wire. Upon neglecting multiple scattering
effects, we may apply the latter expression to integrate the contributions from
a cluster of raindrops and, consequently, use the result to evaluate the corre-
sponding power received by the (matched) antenna. For more details on the
subject, we refer the reader to Sec. 6.8 of Ref. [9].

EM Coupling Between Two Multiport Antenna Systems
Perhaps the most famous consequence of reciprocity in EM theory is that
the transmitting and receiving patterns of an antenna system are, subject to
certain conditions, fully equivalent. This property is widely applied to a typical
antenna pattern measurementconﬁguration in which the (test) antenna, whose
EM radiation characteristics are measured, acts as a receiver of the signal
transmittedfrom the (stationary) referential antenna ([45], Ch. 13). A necessary
condition for such measurements to be successful is the property of reciprocity
of the corresponding transfer impedance ([38] Sec. 2.13). From this reason, it
is of high practical importance to carefully analyze the remote interaction of
two antenna systems. This is exactly the main purpose of this chapter, where
the transfer impedance matrix and its properties are analyzed with the aid of
reciprocity theorems of both the time-convolution and time-correlation types.
7.1
Description of the Problem Conﬁguration
We shall next distinguish between two scenarios shown in Figure 7.1, each
consisting of one transmitting and one receiving antenna located in the linear,
homogeneous, and isotropic embedding ∞. In the analysis that follows, an-
tenna (𝐴) is represented as an 𝑀-port system and antenna (𝐵) as a 𝑁-port
system. The antenna systems (𝐴) and (𝐵) consist of a medium whose EM prop-
erties are speciﬁedby the (tensorial) transverseadmittanceand the longitudinal
impedance denoted by {̂𝜼𝐴, ̂𝜻𝐴} and {̂𝜼𝐵, ̂𝜻𝐵} (see Eqs. (1.23) and (1.24)). The
analyzed antenna conﬁgurations may also contain (perfectly) conducting parts
(see Section 1.5 for details). In state (BA), antenna (𝐴) operates as a radiator of
EM wave ﬁelds and antenna (𝐵) acts as a loaded scatterer, while in state (AB)
their roles are mutually interchanged.
In accordance with standard network theory ([7], Ch. 8), EM coupling be-
tween two such linear and time-invariant antenna multiport systems can be
described in terms of network parameters. Without loss of generality, we shall
next choose the so-called (open-circuit) impedance parameters. Accordingly,
in state (BA), the voltages ̂𝑉𝐴;T

• ̂𝒁𝐴;T is the [𝑀× 𝑀] (radiation) impedance matrix describing the local in-
teractions of the 𝑀-port transmitting antenna system (𝐴).
• ̂𝒁𝐵;L is the [𝑁× 𝑁] (load) impedance matrix describing the local interac-
tions of the 𝑁-port receiving antenna system (𝐵).
• ̂𝒁𝐴𝐵is the [𝑀× 𝑁] (transfer) impedance matrix describing the remote in-
teractions from 𝑁-port receiving antenna system (𝐵) to 𝑀-port transmitting
antenna system (𝐴).
• ̂𝒁𝐵𝐴is the [𝑁× 𝑀] (transfer) impedance matrix describing the remote in-
teractions from 𝑀-port transmitting antenna system (𝐴) to 𝑁-port receiving
antenna system (𝐵).

In line with Sec. 30.4 of Ref. [16], such interaction can be described using one
[(𝑀+ 𝑁) × (𝑀+ 𝑁)] partitioned impedance matrix that is broken into the
impedance submatrices whose meaning is given above (see Figure 7.2). The

ments of the transfer matrix ̂𝒁𝐴𝐵, for instance, can be speciﬁed either as ̂𝑍𝐴𝐵
𝑝,𝑞
for 𝑝= {1, … , 𝑀} and 𝑞= {𝑀+ 1, … , 𝑀+ 𝑁} in the partitioned matrix in-
dex notation, or, equivalently, as ̂𝑍𝐴𝐵

using its local indices {𝑚, 𝑛}. In the description that follows, we shall prefer
the local index notation, while keeping the block matrix format in mind, in
particular, for computer implementation purposes.
Similar impedance parameters can also be deﬁned for state (AB), where
antenna (𝐵) operates as a transmitter, while antenna (𝐴) acts as a receiver.
Upon interchanging (𝐴) and (𝐵) in Eqs. (7.1) and (7.2), we obtain
̂𝑽𝐵;T(𝑠) = ̂𝒁𝐵;T(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑰𝐵;T(𝑠) + ̂𝒁𝐵𝐴(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑰𝐴;R(𝑠)

̂𝑽𝐴;R(𝑠) = ̂𝒁𝐴𝐵(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑰𝐵;T(𝑠) + ̂𝒁𝐴;L(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑰𝐴;R(𝑠)

Again, the system given in Eqs. (7.5) and (7.6) can be cast into the partitioned-
matrix form that is similar to the one described using Eqs. (7.3) and (7.4)
(cf. Figure 7.2).

Analysis Based on the Reciprocity Theorem of the
Time-Convolution Type
In this section, the mutual coupling between the two multiport antenna systems
is analyzed with the aid of the reciprocity theorem of the time-convolution type
(see Section 1.4.1). In the ﬁrst step, the reciprocity theorem is applied to the
unbounded domain exterior to both interacting antenna systems and to the
total EM wave ﬁelds in the analyzed situations (see Table 7.1).
Using the generic form of the reciprocity theorem (1.30) in combination with
the conclusions drawn in Section 1.4.3, we end up with

where we have taken into account the self-adjoint properties of the embedding.
If, in addition, antenna (𝐴) is reciprocal in its EM behavior, that is,
̂𝜼𝐴(𝒙, 𝑠) = (̂𝜼𝐴)(𝒙, 𝑠)
(7.8)
̂𝜻𝐴(𝒙, 𝑠) = (̂𝜻𝐴)(𝒙, 𝑠)

to the one taken on its terminal surface 𝐴

for arbitrary values of ̂𝐼𝐵;T

for all 𝑚= {1, … , 𝑀} and 𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}.
Finally, recall that the resulting Eq. (7.13) describing the transfer impedance
matrix of the interaction from antenna system (𝐵) to antenna system (𝐴) has
been derived under the assumption that antenna (𝐴) and the embedding are re-
ciprocal in their EM constitutive properties, whatever the reciprocity behavior
of antenna (𝐵).

is,

for arbitrary values of ̂𝐼𝐵;T

for all 𝑚= {1, … , 𝑀} and 𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}.
The resulting Eq. (7.18) describing the transfer impedance matrix of the inter-
action from antenna system (𝐴) to antenna system (𝐵) has been derived under
the assumption that antenna (𝐵) and the embedding are reciprocal in their EM
constitutive properties, whatever the reciprocity behavior of antenna (𝐴).
In the case that conditions (7.8) and (7.9) as well as (7.14) and (7.15) do

Finally, in the case that conditions (7.22) and (7.23) as well as (7.28) and (7.29)

Exercise
• Let us assume that antenna systems (𝐴) and (𝐵) are reciprocal and
loss-free in their EM properties and repeat the reciprocity analysis
for the (short-circuit) admittance network parameters.
Hint: The admittance-based description of the remote interaction of two
multiport antenna systems in state (BA) is
̂𝑰𝐴;T(𝑠) = ̂𝒀𝐴;T(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑽𝐴;T(𝑠) + ̂𝒀𝐴𝐵(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑽𝐵;R(𝑠)
̂𝑰𝐵;R(𝑠) = ̂𝒀𝐵𝐴(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑽𝐴;T(𝑠) + ̂𝒀𝐵;L(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑽𝐵;R(𝑠)
while for state (AB) we may write
̂𝑰𝐵;T(𝑠) = ̂𝒀𝐵;T(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑽𝐵;T(𝑠) + ̂𝒀𝐵𝐴(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑽𝐴;R(𝑠)
̂𝑰𝐴;R(𝑠) = ̂𝒀𝐴𝐵(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑽𝐵;T(𝑠) + ̂𝒀𝐴;L(𝑠) ⋅̂𝑽𝐴;R(𝑠)
Under the assumption that the antenna systems are reciprocal, the reciprocity
relation of the time-convolution type (7.7) directly leads to Eq. (7.19). If the
receiving antenna systems in both states are short-circuited, thatis, let ̂𝑉𝐴;R

7 EM Coupling Between Two Multiport Antenna Systems
Next, under the assumption that the antenna systems are loss-free, the reci-
procity relation of the time-correlation type (7.21) directly leads to Eq. (7.33)
that for short-circuited receiving antennas has the following form:

Compensation Theorems for the EM Coupling Between
Two Multiport Antennas
The EM ﬁeld transfer between two antenna systems is inevitably affected by the
presence of neighboring objects located in the antenna’s (radiative) coupling
path. A convenient tool to describe the impact of such an object is found in
EM compensation theorems. The concept of compensation is well known in
standardelectricalnetworktheorywhereitfurnishesanexpedientmethodology
for calculating the effect of a change in the value of a circuit element ([7], Sec.
9.6). The Kirchhoff circuit compensation theorems have been later generalized
to its EM form [35], thereby providing an effective instrument to formulate
and solve various EM boundary value problems [34]. In this chapter, we shall
apply reciprocity theorems of both the time-convolution and time-correlation
types to introduce the EM compensation theorems describing the impact of
a scattering object on the EM ﬁeld transfer between two multiport antenna
systems.
8.1
Description of the Problem Conﬁguration
In this chapter, we shall interrelate the transmitting–receiving scenarios as
shown in Figure 8.1 with those analyzed in Chapter 7. The problem conﬁg-
urations coincide with the ones from Figure 7.1 except for the presence of a
scattering object that is placed exterior to the domains occupied by the antenna
systems. The scatterer occupies domain whose bounding surface is denoted
by 𝜕. As far as its EM behavioris concerned, the medium of the scattereris de-
scribed via the general transverse admittance and the longitudinal impedance,
̂𝜼s = ̂𝜼s(𝒙, 𝑠) and ̂𝜻s = ̂𝜻s(𝒙, 𝑠), respectively (see Eqs. (1.23) and (1.24)), that in-
clude EM penetrable scatterers that are possibly inhomogeneous, anisotropic,
and dispersive. In case that the scatterer is perfectly conducting, the explicit-
type boundary conditions apply upon approaching 𝜕from its exterior domain
(cf. Eqs. (6.10) and (6.11)).
Thanks to the presence of the scatterer, the total ﬁelds in the corresponding
scenarios are not the same. Accordingly, we shall deﬁne the total ﬁeld difference

Analysis Based on the Reciprocity Theorem of the
Time-Convolution Type
In this section, the change in the impedance matrix describing the EM ﬁeld
remote interaction between two multiport antenna systems is analyzed with the
aid of the reciprocity theorem of the time-convolution type (see Section 1.4.1).
The reciprocity analysis concerning the change in state (BA) and state (AB) are
discussed separately in the following sections.
8.2.1
The Change in Scenario (𝐁𝐀)
In order to analyze the effect of the scatterer in state (BA), we start with
applying the reciprocity theorem to the unbounded domain exterior to the
antenna systems and the scatterer and to (AB) and (ΔBA) EM ﬁeld states
according to Table 8.1. Since the interrelated EM wave ﬁelds are causal, the
limiting process as described in Section 1.4.3 yields

0 ∪𝐵
0 ∪𝜕

Δ ̂𝑬BA × ̂𝑯AB −̂𝑬AB × Δ ̂𝑯BA)

If the medium of antenna system (𝐴) is self-adjoint in its EM constitutive
properties (see Eqs. (7.8) and (7.9)), the surface integral over its external surface
𝐴
0 can be directly expressed in terms ofthe relevant Kirchhoff circuit quantities
(see Section 1.5.2), namely
∫𝒙∈𝐴

Δ ̂𝑬BA × ̂𝑯AB −̂𝑬AB × Δ ̂𝑯BA)

where we have adhered to the orientation of the electric currents with respect
to the outer normal vector 𝝂along the terminal surface 𝐴

Similar interfacing relation applies to the reciprocal antenna system (𝐵), for
which we can write
∫𝒙∈𝐵

Subsequently,thereciprocitytheoremofthetime-convolutiontypeisappliedto
bounded domain and to the total ﬁelds in states (BA) and (AB) in the absence
of scatterer (see Table 8.2). Owing to the self-adjointness of the embedding and
thanks to the fact that these states are source-free in , we get

(
̂𝑬BA × ̂𝑯AB −̂𝑬AB × ̂𝑯BA)

Finally, upon combining Eqs. (8.3)–(8.6), we get the sought reciprocity relation
of the time-convolution type, speciﬁcally

terers, the right-hand side of Eq. (8.7) can be expressed in terms of equivalent

(8.10)
that can be substituted in Eq. (8.7) to get the ﬁnal reciprocityrelation pertaining
to EM penetrable scatterers. As an example, let us next closely look at the
scenario speciﬁed as follows:
1. The transmitting antennas in the both states (BA) and ( ̃
BA) are activated
by electric currents ̂𝐼𝐴;T
𝑚
and ̂𝐼𝐴;̃T
𝑚
, respectively, that are identical, that is,
̂𝐼𝐴;T
𝑚
= ̂𝐼𝐴;̃T
𝑚
for all 𝑚= {1, … , 𝑀}. Accordingly, we let Δ ̂𝐼𝐴;T
𝑚
= 0 for all
𝑚= {1, … , 𝑀}.
2. The receiving antennas in both states (BA) and ( ̃
BA) are open-circuited at
all of their accessible ports. Hence, we have ̂𝐼𝐵;R
𝑛
= 0 and ̂𝐼𝐵;̃R
𝑛
= 0 for all
𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}, which implies Δ ̂𝐼𝐵;R
𝑛
= 0 for all 𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}.
3. The receiving antenna in state (AB) is open-circuited at all of its terminal
ports. Hence, we let ̂𝐼𝐴;R
𝑚
= 0 for all 𝑚= {1, … , 𝑀}.

The Change in Scenario (𝐀𝐁)
In this section, we shall describe the impact of the scatterer on the antenna
remote interaction in state (AB) where antenna system (𝐵) operates as a multi-
port transmitter, while antenna system (𝐴) acts as a multiport loaded scatterer.
The reciprocity analysis follows the lines of reasoning from the previous sec-
tion. Accordingly, we begin with the application of the reciprocity theorem
to the exterior domain outside the antenna systems and the scatterer and to
states to (BA) and (ΔAB) EM ﬁeld states (see Table 8.4). In this way, using the

Substituting the latter equality in Eq. (8.17), we get the ﬁnal reciprocity relation
describing the impact of an EM penetrable scatterer. Finally, let us closely
analyze the following situation:
1. The transmitting antennas in both states (AB) and ( ̃
AB) are activated by
electric currents ̂𝐼𝐵;T
𝑛
and ̂𝐼𝐵;̃T
𝑛
, respectively, that are identical, that is,
̂𝐼𝐵;T
𝑛
= ̂𝐼𝐵;̃T
𝑛
for all 𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}. Accordingly, we let Δ ̂𝐼𝐵;T
𝑛
= 0 for all
𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}.
2. The receiving antennas in both states (AB) and ( ̃
AB) are open-circuited at
all of their accessible ports. Hence, we have ̂𝐼𝐴;R
𝑚
= 0 and ̂𝐼𝐴;̃R
𝑚
= 0 for all
𝑚= {1, … , 𝑀}, which implies Δ ̂𝐼𝐴;R
𝑚
= 0 for all 𝑚= {1, … , 𝑀}.
3. The receiving antenna in state (BA) is open-circuited at all of its terminal
ports. Hence, we let ̂𝐼𝐵;R
𝑛

Analysis Based on the Reciprocity Theorem of the
Time-Correlation Type
In this section, the reciprocity theorem of the time-correlation type (see Sec-
tion 1.4.2) is applied to analyze the remote interaction between two multiport
antenna systems. The analysis of the change in the mutual impedance matrices
is discussed separately for state (BA) and state (AB).
8.3.1
The Change in Scenario (𝐁𝐀)
To analyze the impact of presence of the scatterer in state (BA), the reciprocity
theorem is ﬁrst applied to the unbounded domain exterior to the antenna
systems and the scatterer and to (AB) and (ΔBA) EM ﬁeld states (see Table
8.5). Since the interrelated EM wave ﬁelds are causal, the limiting process as
described in Section 1.4.3 yields

properties (see Section 1.5.1), the integral over its bounding surface can be
expressed as

8 Compensation Theorems for the EM Coupling Between Two Multiport Antennas
Exercise
• Compensation theorems in EM theory are frequently used in con-
junction with the concept of surface impedance (e.g., Ref. [24]). Ac-
cordingly, let us analyze the EM ﬁeld from a vertical electrical dipole
over an imperfectly conducting ground and provide an approximate
model for the excited horizontal electric ﬁeld involving only the EM
ﬁelds for a PEC ground and the surface impedance.
Hint: The EM ﬁeld components that are parallel (denoted by subscript t) with
respect to the conducting ground at 𝑥3 = 0 (see Figure 8.2) can be expressed as
̂𝑬t(𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3, 𝑠) = ̂𝑗(𝑠)𝛁t𝜕3 ̂𝐺(𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3, 𝑠)∕𝑠𝜖0
̂𝑯t(𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3, 𝑠) = ̂𝑗(𝑠)[𝛁× ̂𝐺(𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3, 𝑠)𝒊3]t
in 𝑥3 > 0, where the Green’s function satisﬁes
(𝛁⋅𝛁) ̂𝐺−(𝑠2∕𝑐2
0) ̂𝐺= 0
for 𝑥3 > 0 along with the excitation condition:

with ℎ> 0 being the source height and the (Leontovich) impedance boundary
condition:
lim

where ̂𝑍(𝑠) is the surface impedance describing the reﬂection properties of the
boundary surface. Next, take the advantage of the problem shift invariance and

which entails ̃𝜕𝜅= −i𝑠𝛼𝜅with 𝜅∈{1, 2} and {𝑠∈ℝ; 𝑠> 0}. Then show that
̃𝐺(𝛼1, 𝛼2, 𝑥3, 𝑠) = exp[−𝑠𝛾0|𝑥3 −ℎ|]∕2𝑠𝛾0 + exp[−𝑠𝛾0(𝑥3 + ℎ)]∕2𝑠𝛾0

with respect to the PEC half-space and 𝛾0 = (𝑐−2

Hence, prove that

where (PEC) denotes the EM ﬁeld corresponding to the PEC half-space and
𝑥′
3 is the vertical coordinate of the source dipole. Note that the latter equality
does not involve any approximation but still requires the knowledge of the
equivalent electric current surface density on the surface of the non perfectly
conducting ground, whose calculation is in general a difﬁcult task. An efﬁcient
yet reasonably accurate way out of this difﬁculty is known as the Cooray–
Rubinstein formula [36], namely,
̂𝑬t(𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3, 𝑠)|𝑥′
3=ℎ

3=ℎ
+ ̂𝑍(𝑠) 𝝂× ̂𝑯PEC
t
(𝑥1, 𝑥2, 0+, 𝑠)|𝑥′
3=ℎ
This approximation makes possible to evaluate the EM ﬁeld excited by the
vertical electrical dipole above a non perfectly conducting ground using the
corresponding EM wave ﬁelds pertaining to the PEC half-space. As the latter
ﬁelds are known in closed form, the Cooray–Rubinstein formula is in particular
suitable for evaluating transient EM ﬁelds excited by lightning return strokes.
For analytical studies on its validity, we refer the reader to Refs [41,49] and a
generalization of the Cooray–Rubinstein formula in the time domain has been
introduced in Ref. [44].

Compensation Theorems for the EM Scattering of an

in radar cross section reduction and antenna characterization [1,28]. Accord-
ingly,weshallnextanalyzethepossibilityofcontrollingtheEMantennascatter-
ing of a multiport receiving antenna system by changing its loading impedance
matrix. More precisely, the reciprocity theorem of the time-convolution type
is applied to demonstrate that the change of antenna EM scattering is propor-
tional to the impulse-excited radiated EM wave ﬁeld constituents as deﬁned
in Section 5.1. Owing to the proportionality to the radiated ﬁelds in the corre-
sponding transmitting situation, this part of the total scattered EM wave ﬁeld
can be recognized as the “reradiated” EM wave ﬁeld. In this chapter, it is shown
that the Kirchhoff-type equivalent circuits introduced in Chapter 5 cannot be
in general used to calculate the power scattered by an antenna system but
merely to ﬁnd its re-radiated EM power. Although the latter quantity has no
direct physical signiﬁcance on its own, it is useful for gaining an insight into
the adequacy of the Kirchhoff-type equivalent networks in analyzing the EM
antenna scattering.
9.1
Description of the Problem Conﬁguration
In this section, we shall describe the impact of a change in the antenna load
on EM scattering of an 𝑁-port receiving antenna system. To this end, two
receiving scenarios differing in the antenna load only are analyzed with the
aid of the reciprocity theorem of the time-convolution type (see Figure 9.1).
The receiving states are denoted by (R) and (̃R) and the corresponding load
impedance matrices are ̂𝑍L
𝑚,𝑛and ̂𝑍̃L
𝑚,𝑛for 𝑚= {1, … , 𝑁} and 𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁},
respectively. The receiving antenna systems are in both scenarios irradiated
either by the uniform plane wave (see Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2)) or by the incident
EM wave ﬁeld generated by external sources. Consequently, the change in EM
scattering behavior is described using the scattered ﬁeld difference, namely,
{Δ ̂𝑬s, Δ ̂𝑯s}(𝒙, 𝑠) ≜{ ̂𝑬̃s −̂𝑬s, ̂𝑯̃s −̂𝑯s}(𝒙, 𝑠)

The change in the total EM wave ﬁelds manifests itself through the change of
the Kirchhoff circuit quantities associated with the antenna load (see Eqs. (4.12)
and (4.13)). Hence, we deﬁne

(9.2)
for all 𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}. Again, the corresponding EM ﬁeld states will be further
denoted by (Δs) and (ΔR). In order to express the change of the scattered
EM wave ﬁeld in the antenna embedding, the relevant EM ﬁeld states will be
interrelatedwith the testing ﬁeld state (B) that is deﬁned as a receiving situation
in which the antenna system is irradiated by (fundamental) testing electric or
magnetic current volume densities:

transmitting scenario (T) is shown in Figure 4.1.

Reciprocity Analysis
In the ﬁrst step of the analysis, we apply the reciprocity theorem of the time-
convolution type to the domain exterior to the antenna system and to (ΔR)

The following task to explore is the (reciprocity) relation between the trans-
mitting situation (T) and the testing ﬁeld state (B). To this end, the reciprocity
theoremis applied to the unbounded domain ∞according to Table 9.2, which

where, again, we have used the facts that both states are causal and the embed-
ding is self-adjoint in its EM behavior. The next step, again, consists of applying
the reciprocity theorem to the bounded domain and of interfacing the EM
wave ﬁeld quantities on the terminal surface with the relevant Kirchhoff circuit

the change of the antenna EM scattering with the electric-current and voltage-
impulse-excited radiated EM wave ﬁelds. The two cases shall be next discussed
separately.
9.2.1
Compensation Theorems in Terms of Electric Current-excited Sensing
EM Fields
To express the change in the antenna EM scattering using the electric-current
impulse-excited sensing EM wave ﬁelds, the reciprocity relation (9.10) is ﬁrst
re-written using Eq. (5.16), namely
̂𝜄B(𝑠) 𝒍B ⋅̂𝒆T;I
𝑛(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) ̂𝐼T
𝑛(𝑠) −̂𝜅B(𝑠) 𝒍B ⋅̂𝒉T;I

= −̂𝑉B
𝑛(𝑠) ̂𝐼T
𝑛(𝑠) −̂𝑉T
𝑛(𝑠) ̂𝐼B
𝑛(𝑠)
(9.11)
which in view of problem linearity applies to all 𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}. Consider-
ing the electric-current-excited testing wave ﬁelds with the open-circuited

receiving antenna system in state (B), that is, ̂𝜅B(𝑠) = 0 and ̂𝐼B
𝑛(𝑠) = 0 for all
𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}, the combination of Eqs. (9.7) and (9.11) leads to

𝑛(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)Δ ̂𝐼R
𝑛(𝑠)
(9.12)
for 𝒙𝑆∈∞, where we have invoked the condition that the resulting condition
has to hold for arbitrary ̂𝜄B(𝑠) 𝒍B. Similarly, the nonzero magnetic current testing
source with the open-circuited antenna system in situation (B) results in the
change of the scattered magnetic ﬁeld:
Δ ̂𝑯s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) = −
𝑁
∑
𝑛=1
̂𝒉T;I
𝑛(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)Δ ̂𝐼R

(9.13)
for 𝒙𝑆∈∞. Finally, note that the compensation theorems can also be ex-
pressed using the corresponding far-ﬁeld EM wave quantities. For instance, the
far-ﬁeld counterpart of Eq. (9.12) has the following form:
Δ ̂𝑬s;∞(𝝃, 𝑠) = −𝑠𝜇0

𝑛=1

and (4.23)) and Δ ̂𝑯s;∞= 𝜂0 𝝃× Δ ̂𝑬s;∞follows.
9.2.2
Compensation Theorems in Terms of Voltage-Excited Sensing EM Fields
The change in the antenna scattering can also be described with the aid of the
voltage-impulse-excited sensing EM wave ﬁelds deﬁned in Eq. (5.18). To this
end, the latter is used in Eq. (9.10) and we get
̂𝜄B(𝑠) 𝒍B ⋅̂𝒆T;V

(9.15)
for all 𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}. Assuming now that the receiving antenna system in
state (B) is short-circuited at all of its accessible ports, that is, ̂𝑉B
𝑛(𝑠) = 0 for all
𝑛= {1, … , 𝑁}, the change in the scatteredelectric ﬁeld strength can be written
as
Δ ̂𝑬s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) =

𝑛=1

(9.16)
for 𝒙𝑆∈∞, where we have taken ̂𝜅B(𝑠) = 0 and invoked the condition that
the resulting relation has to hold for arbitrary ̂𝜄B(𝑠) 𝒍B. Following the similar

lines of reasoning, the change of the scattered magnetic ﬁeld strength reads
Δ ̂𝑯s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) =

∑
𝑛=1
̂𝒉T;V
𝑛
(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)Δ ̂𝑉R

(9.17)

may write

(9.18)
for example,for all 𝝃∈Ω = {𝝃⋅𝝃= 1}, where we have used Eq. (5.10). Finally,
the electric-type far-ﬁeld amplitude follows from 𝜂0Δ ̂𝑬s;∞= Δ ̂𝑯s;∞× 𝝃.
9.2.3
Power Reciprocity Expressions
The compensationtheoremsderived in Sections 9.2.1 and 9.2.2 are next applied
to ﬁnd power-related antenna reciprocity relations that are useful for under-
standing the limitations of the Kirchhoff-type equivalent networks of a multi-
port receiving antenna system. To this end, we start with the antenna power–
reciprocity relation associated with the transmitting situation (cf. Eq. (1.46)):

(9.19)
that is found upon applying the reciprocity theorem of the time-correlation
type to the antenna domain and to one and the same transmitting state (T).
The interaction surface integral over the antenna bounding surface can be next
expressed using the radiated far-ﬁeld amplitudes (see Eqs. (1.45) and (4.10)):
∫𝒙∈0
(
̂𝑬T × ̂𝑯T⊛+ ̂𝑬T⊛× ̂𝑯T)

= (𝜂0∕8𝜋2)
∫𝝃∈Ω
̂𝑬T;∞(𝝃, 𝑠) ⋅̂𝑬T;∞(𝝃, −𝑠)dΩ
(9.20)
where we have used the time-reverse self-adjointness of the antenna embedding
together with the property of causality of the transmitted EM wave ﬁeld. Fur-
thermore, the surface integration on the antenna terminal surface is expressed

where we have adhered to the conventional orientation of the electric currents
in the transmitting situation. For loss-free reciprocal antenna systems, the
combination of Eqs. (9.19)–(9.21) with Eqs. (4.2) and (4.23) yields

quantity corresponding to the electric-current impulse-excited compensation
theorem (9.14) has the following form:

Now, if the receiving antenna system in state (R) is open-circuited at all of
its accessible ports, Eq. (9.24) can be, in the limit {𝑠= 𝛿+ i𝜔, 𝛿↓0, 𝜔∈ℝ},
interpreted as the (time-averaged) EM power dissipated internally in the rele-
vant Th ́𝑒venin equivalent network. Similarly, making use of the voltage-excited

which for the short-circuited receiving antenna system in the receiving state (R)
yields the expression for the internal power dissipated in the relevant Norton
equivalent network. In conclusion, it has been just demonstrated that the inter-
nal power dissipated in the Kirchhoff-type equivalent circuits can be related to
the (re-radiated)powerquantity associatedwith thechange of the scatteredEM
wave ﬁeld. The latter, in general, is not equal to the total EM power scattered
by the antenna system. An important exception in this respect are small dipole
antennas that do not show structural EM scattering. For more details on the
subject, we refer the reader to Refs [40,42] and to the references therein.

9 Compensation Theorems for the EM Scattering of an Antenna System
Exercises
• Give special forms of the derived compensation theorems concern-
ing a 1-port (a) open-circuited, (b) short-circuited, and (c) matched
receiving antenna in state (R).
Hint: If the receiving antenna in state (R) is open-circuited, we have ̂𝐼R(𝑠) = 0
and Eq. (9.12) with 𝑁= 1 leads to (cf. Ref. [10], Eq. (10))
Δ ̂𝑬s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)| ̂𝑍L→∞= ̂𝑬̃s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) −̂𝑬s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)| ̂𝑍L→∞
= −̂𝒆T;I(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) ̂𝐼̃R(𝑠)
= −̂𝒆T;I(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) ̂𝐼G(𝑠) ̂𝑌̃L(𝑠)∕[ ̂𝑌T(𝑠) + ̂𝑌̃L(𝑠)]
Equivalently, making use of the voltage-excited compensation theorem (9.16),
we may express the change as
Δ ̂𝑬s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)| ̂𝑍L→∞= ̂𝒆T;V(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)Δ ̂𝑉R(𝑠)
= −̂𝒆T;V(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) ̂𝑉G(𝑠) ̂𝑌̃L(𝑠)∕[ ̂𝑌T(𝑠) + ̂𝑌̃L(𝑠)]
which reveals that the sensing impulse-excited EM wave ﬁelds are interrelated
via the radiation impedance, that is, ̂𝒆T;I = ̂𝒆T;V ̂𝑍T. Similarly, if the receiving
antenna in state (R) is short-circuited, we have ̂𝑉R(𝑠) = 0 and Eq. (9.16) with
𝑁= 1 leads to
Δ ̂𝑬s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)| ̂𝑍L↓0 = ̂𝑬̃s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) −̂𝑬s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)| ̂𝑍L↓0
= ̂𝒆T;V(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) ̂𝑉̃R(𝑠)
= ̂𝒆T;V(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) ̂𝑉G(𝑠) ̂𝑍̃L(𝑠)∕[ ̂𝑍T(𝑠) + ̂𝑍̃L(𝑠)]
Equivalently, the electric-current-excited compensation theorem (9.12) yields
(cf. Ref. [10] Eq. (9))
Δ ̂𝑬s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)| ̂𝑍L↓0 = −̂𝒆T;I(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)Δ ̂𝐼R(𝑠)
= ̂𝒆T;I(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) ̂𝐼G(𝑠) ̂𝑍̃L(𝑠)∕
[ ̂𝑍T(𝑠) + ̂𝑍̃L(𝑠)
]
Finally, if the receiving antenna is matched to its transmitting state, the electric-
current-excited compensation theorem (9.12) leads to
Δ ̂𝑬s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)| ̂𝑍L→̂𝑍T = ̂𝑬̃s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) −̂𝑬s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)| ̂𝑍L→̂𝑍T
= −̂𝒆T;I(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)Δ ̂𝐼R(𝑠) = −1
2 ̂𝒆T;I(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) ̂𝐼G(𝑠)̂Γ(𝑠)

while its voltage-excited counterpart (9.16) gives
Δ ̂𝑬s(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)| ̂𝑍L→̂𝑍T = ̂𝒆T;V(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠)Δ ̂𝑉R(𝑠)
= −1
2 ̂𝒆T;V(𝒙𝑆, 𝑠) ̂𝑉G(𝑠)̂Γ(𝑠)
where we have introduced the reﬂection coefﬁcient
̂Γ(𝑠) = [ ̂𝑍T(𝑠) −̂𝑍̃L(𝑠)]∕[ ̂𝑍T(𝑠) + ̂𝑍̃L(𝑠)]
= [ ̂𝑌̃L(𝑠) −̂𝑌T(𝑠)]∕[ ̂𝑌T(𝑠) + ̂𝑌̃L(𝑠)]
Antenna scattering compensation theorems in terms of the reﬂection coefﬁ-
cient have been previously discussed by Hansen [25], for instance.
• Apply the electric-current impulse-excited compensation theorem
(9.12) and the forward-scattering theorem (3.12) to the case of open-
circuited, electric-current-excited small dipole antennas.
Hint: At ﬁrst, it is observed that the small dipole antennas share theproperties
𝜶⋅̂𝓵T;I(𝜷, −𝑠) = 𝜶⋅̂𝓵T;I(−𝜷, 𝑠)
𝜶⋅̂𝓵T;I(𝜷, 𝑠) = 𝜶⋅̂𝓵T;I(−𝜷, −𝑠)
where 𝜶is a unit vector in the direction of polarization and 𝜷is a unit vector in
the direction of propagation of the incident EM plane wave. Indeed, for a short
wire carrying a uniform electric current, we may write
𝜶⋅̂𝓵T;I(±𝜷, 𝑠) = −𝜶⋅𝓵
irrespective of 𝑠, where 𝓵is the vectorial length of the wire, while for a small
loop carrying a uniform electric current, we have
𝜶⋅̂𝓵T;I(−𝜷, 𝑠) = 𝑠𝑐−1
0 ⋅(𝜷× 𝜶) = 𝜶⋅̂𝓵T;I(𝜷, −𝑠)
𝜶⋅̂𝓵T;I(𝜷, 𝑠) = 𝑠𝑐−1
0 ⋅(𝜶× 𝜷) = 𝜶⋅̂𝓵T;I(−𝜷, −𝑠)
where is the vectorial area of the loop. The compensation theorem Eq. (9.12)
is then used to express the change of the co-polarized EM scattered ﬁeld in the
forward direction and we get
(𝑠𝜇0)−1𝜶⋅Δ ̂𝑬s;∞(𝜷, −𝑠)| ̂𝑍L→∞= 𝜶⋅̂𝓵T;I(−𝜷, 𝑠) ̂𝐼̃R(−𝑠)

where we have neglected the (structural) EM scattering of an open-circuited
small antenna. The right-hand side of the last relation can be in the limit
{𝑠= 𝛿+ i𝜔, 𝛿↓0, 𝜔∈ℝ} interpreted as the power dissipated in the internal
and load impedances of Th́evenin’s equivalent circuit. In accordance with the
general form of the forward-scattering theorem (3.12), the internal power can
be, for such a special class of antennas, associated with the scattered power,
while the power dissipated in the antenna load corresponds to the absorbed
power.

̂𝑓(𝑠) = ∫
∞
𝑡=0
exp(−𝑠𝑡)𝑓(𝑡)d𝑡
(A.1)
with {𝑠∈ℂ; Re(𝑠) > 𝑠0} being its transformation parameter. Interpreting
Eq. (1.9) as an integral equation, an important question as to its uniqueness
arises. This question has been settled by a Czech mathematician Matýǎs Lerch
(see Refs [31]; [52], Ch. II; and [20], Sec. 5) such that we may state:
Theorem A.1 Two original functions 𝑔(𝑡) and 𝑞(𝑡), whose image functions are
identical, that is, ̂𝑔(𝑠) ≡̂𝑞(𝑠), differ at most by a null function 𝑛(𝑡) for which
∫
𝑡
𝜏=0
𝑛(𝜏)d𝜏= 0
(A.2)
for all 𝑡≥0 and hence ̂𝑛(𝑠) = 0.
The question of uniqueness can be hence reduced to demonstrating that
the corresponding homogeneous integral equation, ̂𝑓(𝑠) = 0, does not posses a
nonzero solution.

Then 𝜓(𝑥) ≡0 in {0 ≤𝑥≤1}.

108
Appendix A Lerch’s Uniqueness Theorem
The lemma is next proved by contradiction along the lines presented in
Appendix I of Ref. [4]. Hence, if 𝜓(𝑥) is not identically zero in {0 ≤𝑥≤1},
there must be an interval {𝑎≤𝑥≤𝑏}, with 0 < 𝑎< 𝑏< 1, where 𝜓(𝑥) is either
positive or negative. Without loss of generality, we shall next assume the former
case:
𝜓(𝑥) = 0
for {0 ≤𝑥< 𝑎} ∪{𝑏< 𝑥≤1}
(A.4)
𝜓(𝑥) > 0
for {𝑎≤𝑥≤𝑏}
(A.5)
Let us next consider a function that is linear in 𝑥:
ℎ(𝑥) = (𝑥∕𝑎)H(𝑥) −[(𝑥−𝑥0)∕𝑎]H(𝑥−𝑥0)
−[(𝑥−𝑥0)∕(1 −𝑏)]H(𝑥−𝑥0) + [(𝑥−1)∕(1 −𝑏)]H(𝑥−1)
(A.6)
with 𝑥0 = 𝑎∕(1 −𝑏+ 𝑎) and H(𝑥) denotes the Heaviside unit step function.
Then, in virtue of (A.3), we should get
∫
1
𝑥=0
ℎ𝑚(𝑥)𝜓(𝑥)d𝑥= 0
for all 𝑚= {0, 1, …}
(A.7)
since ℎ𝑚(𝑥) is a polynomial in 𝑥. Next observe that
0 < ℎ(𝑥) < 1
for {0 ≤𝑥< 𝑎} ∪{𝑏< 𝑥≤1}
(A.8)
ℎ(𝑥) ≥1
for {𝑎≤𝑥≤𝑏}
(A.9)
which implies that ℎ𝑚(𝑥) can be made as small as we wish in {0 ≤𝑥< 𝑎} ∪{𝑏<
𝑥≤1} and as large as we wish in {𝑎< 𝑥< 𝑏} for the increasing positive integer
𝑚(see Fig. A.1). Consequently, our assumption (A.4)–(A.5) leads to
∫
1
𝑥=0
ℎ𝑚(𝑥)𝜓(𝑥)d𝑥> 0
for all 𝑚= {0, 1, …}
(A.10)
This is, however, in contradiction to (A.7) and hence to (A.3). It thus follows
that 𝜓(𝑥) ≡0 in {0 ≤𝑥≤1} and the lemma is proved.

(A.11)
In order to relax the requirement that 𝑓(𝑡) is a continuous function of time, we
do not apply the lemma to Eq. (A.11) but instead, we begin with the integration

proved that the Laplace transformation (A.1) of a causal function 𝑓(𝑡) is unique
for our purposes.
