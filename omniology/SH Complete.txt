Introduction
Welcome to Street Hypnosis Boot Camp.
Applause
Welcome back everyone. I’ve seen a lot of familiar faces which makes me 
very excited. I know that this means our job will be so much easier, so thanks 
for coming back. Let me check, how many of you are here for the first time? 
About half. How many of you have already done some form of hypnosis 
before? 
This is going to be such a breeze, isn’t it?
Probably more then what’s going to happen.
They’re going to get in so much trouble now.
I’m thinking that’s happening.
I’m excited. Let’s just have a quick second to find out where people are from. 
How many people are here from the U.S.? I’d guess that’s most of you. Is 
anyone here from somewhere not the U.S.? 
The Netherlands.
Not bad. We have the Netherlands, the U.S., Australia (that’s a long way to 
come, I hope it’s worth it), Scotland, Canada, Sweden (we like Sweden). A lot 
of you are from Australia, guess we’ll have to go there next. That’s the place 
to be.
Australia’s in the house.
We have a nice mix here. My name is Igor Ledochowski, as you probably 
already know. I’m here with the world’s fastest hypnotist Spencer Spencer. 
You will love him. 
Applause
How many of you have seen Spencer in action before? Wasn’t he amazing?
Cool.

Students:
For the next three days, even though it’s a four day course we’ll only be 
working for three days, do you know why?
We’re going to have fun on the fourth day.
You guessed it, on the fourth day you’ll have a lot of fun. You see, our aim for 
the next four days is to drill you. This is called boot camp for a reason. We’re 
going to work you hard. We’ll work you so hard, that by the fourth day every 
one of you in this room will be doing a show up here in Vegas, filmed, you’ll 
get a tape and everything. 
You’ll love it. It’ll be so easy you’ll wonder why you ever had any nerves or 
trepidation about that before. Wouldn’t that be something?
Yes.
How many of you feel a bit nervous about that right now?
Laughter
That’s only natural. One of the keys to creating confidence is competence. 
The key to creating competence, of course, is to practice correctly the right 
things. 
One of the things I want to ask you to do over the next three days with us is 
to give it your all. These are long days. We’ll be working 12 hours a day, from 
9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., long days. So, when you’re feeling tired, that’s the 
time to give it extra.
Has anyone here ever been to the Army? Isn’t that how the Army works in 
boot camp they tire you out? When you’re tired is when the skills come in, so 
when you actually being under pressure that’s where we’ll come out and we 
will tire you out, I promise you this. It’s guaranteed!
The only thing I’ll ask for you to do–
1. Number one is to keep a good attitude. Have fun with this. This is a fun 
thing to do. 
2. Number two is to give it your all, especially when you’re tired. Go that 
extra mile.
You know we’ll go to 9:30 at the latest; we will finish. Then you can go 
upstairs and collapse in your bed, and it’s done. So until 9:00 or 9:30, give it 
everything you’ve got. Are you guys going to be okay with this?
Yes!

Okay, now we’ve got some hypnotists in the room.
There we go. I wanted to add one thing real quick. Who has a cell phone in 
their pocket? Please turn it off or put it on vibrate and enjoy yourself, the 
show, your time here.
The clean show.
Okay, so we’re going to be working very hard over the next three days to 
prepare you, to teach you everything you need to know to be a great stage 
hypnotist and make a career out of this. 
Out of curiosity, how many people here are actually thinking of doing this 
part-time or full-time, as a kind of money earner, career type thing? About 
three-thirds of the group or something like that. Excellent! Well our aim is to 
give you everything you need, especially on day three, as we’ll look at things 
like the business aspect and stuff like that.
You can’t ask for better than Spencer for someone with experience on that 
side of things, so you’ll be getting Spencer not me. 
Spencer, haven’t you arranged something special as well on the last day, 
Sunday?
The last day we do have something special going down. We’ll be doing a bit 
of hypnosis for everyone here. It will be a mini demonstration of something 
you may see what I do when I do a hypnosis show, so we’ll throw something 
in for you all to enjoy. I think you’ll like that.
Then, Sunday night, I have a pass for everyone here to go to a local hypnosis 
show here in Vegas, no charge, if you’re interested. If you’re interested raise 
your hands, because I need to know how many tickets I need to get. 
This isn’t just a little show it’s like currently, the premiere hypnotist in Vegas. 
He’s on the strip at Planet Hollywood, which is a huge casino. I’ve seen the 
show it’s very exciting and fun. You’ll be seeing it right after you’ve done your 
show, so you can go in and go, I can do better then that.
Laughter
I have to tell you, you will be doing better then that, guaranteed!
You’ll have the enthusiasm still live and running inside you, whereas, doing 
these same shows every single day…he’s a great hypnotist don’t get me 
wrong, a great showman, so you’ll pick up a lot of stuff… but that’s a nice little 
bonus that Spencer arranged for you, so you can buy him a beer in the bar 
later.

Please do.
Applause
Just one note, please wait until Sunday to buy him that beer, because if all of 
you buy him a beer there’ll be no more teaching.
All right. You are about to embark on probably, one of the most fun and 
exciting careers that exists in my opinion. You’ve been doing it for what, 
some 18-20 years now?
Eighteen to twenty plus that, a long time.
When I first met Spencer I said how often do you work? He said I don’t work.
It’s not a job, its fun. When you get to travel around the world and meet 
people, get paid well and taken care of, it’s fun.
This is what I’d like all of you to understand, having the spirit of what we’re 
doing today. This is a tremendous amount of fun, so I want you to enjoy 
yourselves. We’re going to take the pressure right off you for the rest of the 
day.
In other words, whilst we’re doing the inductions and so on, you know the 
classic thing, just pretend to go into trance and just play along with it for now 
and we’ll see what happens. For those of you who have trained with me 
before kind of know what’s coming, but the point is that I don’t want you to 
feel that you have to get any specific results yet.
Right now it’s about training. The results will take care of themselves is that 
okay with you?
Yes.
All you have to do is say some words, point some things, look like a hypnotist 
and that’s pretty much it. Can you do that?
Yes.
Very good. The key thing I want you to focus on over the next three/four days 
is your attitude. In other words, how much fun, how much persona you are 
projecting. You can’t do that when you’re inhibited and in fear, unless of 
course, you’re on stage for seven days like the world’s most anxious 
hypnotist, which could be a draw all by itself.
Laughter

9
I’m guessing that’s not quite the stage persona you want to be cultivating, is 
that correct?
Yes.
So, spend the next few days just having fun, letting that excitement you have 
come through in what you’re doing and enjoy. That’s key, because if you 
don’t have that then you don’t have a show. We’ll teach you the mechanics, 
but one thing I can’t teach you is how to be yourself, because you have a lot 
more practice at doing that then I do.
Bring yourself to the table, enjoy it, have fun with it, play around with it and it’ll 
all go well.
When it comes to actually doing this, in terms of going live out there and 
having a go in the real world, you know something that’s going to be very 
important for you because you’ll have a reference experience and know 
you’ve done it.
Before Sunday we’ll make sure that you have plenty of dress rehearsal, so 
come Sunday, you’ll already know what you’re doing. My aim is to give you a 
skill that will be with you for the rest of your life. 
When I was young and at university I was into martial arts, etc. and one of my 
instructors tried to give us a talk during the day and said you’re coming close 
to your black belt soon and there’s something you should know. 
Once you reach your black belt, no matter what happens to you, how your 
career goes and so on, you will never go hungry because all you have to do 
is hang up a shingle and there’ll always be people who want to learn how to 
defend themselves. That made sense to me and I’d like to give you the same 
piece of advice.
No matter what happens to you in your life or career, after this weekend you 
will never go hungry because you’ll always have a skill you can fall back on, a 
skill that isn’t going to go out of fashion. That’s my aim for you, and it’s not a 
backup plan, it is actually a lifestyle. 
In other words, some of you will love it so much that you might think right 
now, I’ll dabble with it a bit and do a couple shows and so on…that’s kind of 
what happened to you isn’t it?
When I first started I was doing clinical hypnotherapy and got really burned 
out on it. After doing it for about 10 years and working with thousands of 
people, I decided I needed to lighten up a little bit. So, I began dabbling with 
it, working in nightclub after nightclub and it just hit me.

I said to myself, I can’t go back and be a clinician anymore I’ve got to go out 
there and just have fun, and it overtook my entire life. And, what he’s talking 
about is so true because you can pick your hours, your days and your city, 
and there’s no reason why you can’t…any time of your life you can pick up 
the phone and say I think I’m going to go out and make $5000 tonight, and 
you do.
It might take you an hour to do that. Would that be a hard thing to do? Or 
maybe you only make $1000 for an hour.
Oh dear.
Laughter
I have to go back to working at McSpencerald’s right?
Why not, let’s go back to McSpencerald’s. So, you’ll always have these skills 
that you can take with you everywhere for the rest of your life, whether it’s 
working in nightclubs or theaters, working in the corporate world or with clubs, 
organizations and schools, it all lies within you.
And if you have a taste for adventure folks, this is a great thing. You can get 
free cruises this way. You get invited to all kinds of exciting countries, 
seriously. Weren’t you just invited somewhere cool just recently?
One of the coolest places in the entire world. I just got back from Dubai. If you 
haven’t been there, it’s a place you better take extra money with, because 
there are no bargains there. I went there and did three incredible shows and it 
went so well they invited me to stay for an extra week. They twisted my arm.
The coolest thing about that, going someplace like Dubai and on that level 
that I have many experiences most of the time is that they treat you to first-
class roundtrip airfare, five star hotels, limousine service everywhere you go 
and you have a complete staff at your beck and call, taking care of all your 
needs. All you have to do is show up.
And, you never know what kind of royalty you’ll meet in foreign countries who 
will come to your show and give you expensive gifts. 
Doesn’t that beat paying $100,000 grand to go to law school?
Laughter

I’ll mention this quickly but won’t tell exactly what happened because it’s not 
proper protocol, but I was doing a demonstration at a club there called 
Kavali’s, which is the most exclusive club in Dubai. It’s a very sheik place. 
Dubai is a very cosmopolitan place. 
So I’m doing this demonstration, they invited me over there because they 
heard about me on the radio and TV. I was on all the media, it was 
everywhere in the Arab world. They did this incredibly huge article in the 
Saudi paper that is distributed to over a million people.
So, I was doing this demonstration and this gentleman comes up to me, takes 
my hand and looking down I feel this big wad of cash, he goes just put it in 
your pocket. I’m going okay cool. I’m not going to say how much it was but it 
was not bad, more then most people make in a month.
A few minutes later one of the sheiks came down and wanted to meet me 
again, he pulled me down and kisses me on the head, takes a watch off his 
arm and says this is for you. Yes, it is a Rolex.
Now, results do vary. 
Laughter
It could have been a Timex or Casio.
This is where I want you to get excited, because the potential for what you’re 
learning now is immense. It’s up to you with your imagination and creativity 
and how far you push it. If you want to just do local shows that’s fine, if you 
want to go more crazy and do crazy things that’s fine as well, but I wanted 
you to be inspired in terms of where this could go, if you start applying 
yourself. It will require that you apply yourself.

The potential is unlimited and you do need to apply yourself. It is a job, but it’s 
a fun job. It’s a lifestyle, that’s what it is. It’s something you embrace and 
sooner or later it embraces you and you become it. So, as a stage hypnotist 
you are the product and what’s being marketed is you.
Over the course of the next four days do not be me or Igor, be you. You have 
to be you, if you are just you and genuine in who you are then that’s what’s 
going to come out in the show. Don’t go out and try to emulate anybody else, 
just be you.
And perhaps one day you too will be in a city built in the middle of a desert, 
telling people things like, everyone put your hands out like this.
Exactly like that.
And, of course, that’s right…some people won’t quite understand what you 
mean…you say it’s very simple, you just put your hands out like this. 
One or two people will start catching on as you start doing this, but then 
they’ll go okay…put your hands out just like this.
When you put your hands out just like this…
Eventually, more and more people begin to understand what you’re doing. 
You’re doing a show right, put your hands out to this you’ll say to them, and 
they’ll put their hands out just like this with enthusiasm and eagerness.
They might even put their hands together.
And then perhaps interlock those fingers, as you say to them, squeeze those 
fists tightly, fingers locking tightly.
Make sure they’re locked and glued as tightly as you can imagine.
Imagine and feel those hands coming together tighter and tighter.
So tight that they do not want to come apart.
Watch those hands. Focus your mind.
Feel them tighter and tighter.

Tighter and tighter, like cement.
Like magnets stuck together.
Sticking tighter and tighter now.
Even if you wanted to take them apart they would stick tighter and tighter.
Feel that tightness developing now. Imagine it. Want it to be true and it will be 
true.
You can try to pull them apart, but they just stick tighter and tighter.
The harder you try the tighter the stick more and more, tighter together.
I’m sure you’re satisfied now how stuck they are, and I’ll know exactly how 
tight they are and how stuck they are when you close your eyes, if you want 
to.
And relax all the way down.
Just like that.
Fingers relaxing, as quickly as your mind relaxes, all the way down.
Because it just becomes easier and easier for you.
That’s right.
To let go like this.
Let those hands drift down into a comfortable relaxed place.
That’s right.
Your hands.
Letting go more.
Having a wisdom all of their own.
And each time that you respond to these ideas…
Teaching you about relaxation…
…and you just drop deeper.
…and opening up, hands releasing now.

Finding that place inside.
Calm.
Where everything is…
Performing
…soft.
The right level of mental relaxation.
Loosely feeling
That’s right.
Relaxed
To allow your unconscious mind
To drift down
And be free
Easily
To be yourself
Have the experience

And become even more
Each and every day
Beyond all the things you expected
And isn’t it fascinating
Lies
To discover that place
Who you truly are
Deep inside
Inside
Where everything lets go.
And beyond your wildest imagination
Four days
Lies a person
That lets go
That can really have fun
Learning
Enjoying

It beats automatically
Open your mind wide
And it does
To all that you are
And you are
All that you can be
And you will be
Is becoming now
And that’s why you’re here
More than you were
Feel good now
Begin to feel that inside
Let it spread
A sense of who you truly are
Throughout your mind
And bring that

More happiness
You know who you are
A real force for good
The person inside
You can amaze people
On stage
And they’ll be doing all the work
Every time 
They think its all you
But who is it really?
And don’t you be fooled
Because you know what it’s about
All you have to be

Who are you really?
To find out

Embrace the Attitude
Igor:
It would be a remix if you were starting a stage hypnosis course without there 
being hypnosis. I’m sorry we’re not going to start yet, because really it’s more 
important about what you’re doing then what we’re doing isn’t it.
Isn’t it about what you can do at the end of these four days? On day four 
you’ll be showing us exactly what you’re capable of. You’ll love this.
Now, one of the things that – those of you who have trained with me before, 
of course, we’re familiar with and for those of you that haven’t we’ll be familiar 
with you very soon– is one of those important things in acquiring a skill is that 
you adopt a role, something to tell your unconscious mind what to aspire to.
When you adopt a role, what I do not mean by that is that you beat yourself 
up every time you’re not performing like that and they’re like oh, my God I’m 
supposed to be doing it like this and I’m not doing it. That’s not what I’m 
talking about. 
When you adopt a role, it’s like…has anyone ever seen kids playing let’s 
pretend…they’re pouring tea that’s not in the cup and it’s like where’s the 
tea? Do you expect me to drink air what’s going on? But they come quite 
happy to pour the tea and if they make a mistake it’s no big deal, they build it 
into their fantasy.
Would it be all right for the next three days if you jumped in and pretended 
something? Maybe that you are the world’s fastest, funniest, cleverest, most 
impressive or anxious, whatever you want, stage hypnotist in the world? 
Wouldn’t that be something? 
You all have an idea of what kind of a stage hypnotist you want to be and 
what you want to be known for, like the most exciting, speed or the fastest 
hypnotist, charisma whatever…I want you to start adopting that persona right 
now and just pretend. If you fall short of it, do you know what’s going to 
happen? Nothing, seriously.
If you say I’m the world’s most charismatic hypnotist, no one is going to say 
no you’re not look, you have the charisma of a wet leaf of cabbage, and 
you’re like all right thank you. It’s not going to happen. You can step into the 
role step-by-step and if you make a mistake or fall out of character, no big 
deal, just step back into it afterwards.
This is more about you all having fun right. 

23
I remember a while back I went with one of my cousins to a murder mystery 
party. We dressed up like it was the 1920s or something like that, it was a lot 
of fun. Everyone is being from a fancy dressed party or something like that 
where you come as the wookie monster or shaving beast, etc.
Why do you do that? It’s so you can play out the character a little bit. So, 
would it be okay for you all to play up a little character whilst you’re here? 
Unfortunately, I don’t have any top hats and monocles to hand out, but you 
could pretend to be one of the world’s greatest hypnotists could you not?
You can be the greatest, the fastest, the cleverest or funniest, whatever 
superlative works for you, just choose one now. You don’t have to be stuck 
with it, you can cycle through them. You know the old saying ‘specialization is 
for insects.’ So you can be the fastest today and the cleverest tomorrow, and 
the funniest the day after.
Just choose one to start with, try it on for size and see what develops, is that 
fair?
Yes.
I want you to start getting into the role, by actually meeting everyone else in 
the room so everyone stand up and ask the magic questions which 
are…what do people normally ask when they meet each other. What do you 
do? And they go who the hell are you and why are you asking me these 
questions.
The typical question is simply, who are you? I don’t care if you give your 
name or not, but what I do care about is that everyone in this room knows 
you’re the world’s fastest, cleverest, etc. etc. hypnotist of all time. Who is 
really a function of what in this sense?
What do you do? Guess what, stage hypnotist, but not just a stage hypnotist 
you’re THE stage hypnotist. Then just have a couple seconds of chat about 
why you’re here and what it is that you’re going to be contributing to this 
seminar. Notice I’m not saying what are you here to learn? I’m asking you to 
tell people why I’ve invited you to come here to help me teach, because 
unfortunately, I’m nowhere near as good as you guys.
I’ll need your help, so tell everyone else why it is I invited you over and they’ll 
believe you. Is that easy to do? Three simple questions with three simple 
answers. There are eight of you in the room, so we’re going to give you eight 
minutes to meet everyone in the room. Off you go. 
Did you enjoy that so far? 
Yes.

Let’s add a little bit to it then shall we.
All right, here’s what I want you to do this time. This is something that 
happens to everybody when they begin doing stage hypnosis or even as a 
hypnotist. What I want you to do is this, nobody else knows anything about 
who you are or what you do, so when you’re doing a presentation it is your 
presentation, nobody knows what it’s about.
Even if there are other hypnotists in the room, they don’t have a clue about 
who you are or what the dynamics of your personality is or what your shows 
about, so what I want you to do now is the same exercise and let’s just 
exaggerate it. 
Imagine that you’re just talking to somebody and they know absolutely 
nothing about what it is you do, and you have to convince them right now that 
what you’re doing is the absolute best thing in the entire world. Does that 
make sense?
Yes.
Just to add something, which is whilst you’re doing this you may as well get 
outrageous. Convince them of something just totally and utterly ridiculous, as 
related to hypnosis. Why? Because you’re the authority and they will believe 
you. Now, you don’t have to do this in the real world, just here. Just go out on 
a limb for a bit and really put some conviction to what you’re saying. 
Let me tell you why this works. When I was over in Dubai, I was with a 
gentleman who wanted to do some street hypnosis, so I said okay cool let’s 
do it. We went out on the streets of Dubai hypnotizing people, it was kind of 
nutty, and I’m watching this guy who was convincing people that he knew 
what he was doing and I was watching going, they actually believe you.
That’s all it takes.
That’s all. It’s true.
Just like the Bellagio Brothers, put your hands up a second again isn’t that 
pretty much all you did? These guys here, you may have seen them on 
videos on the Internet, at the last hypnotherapy training these guys decided 
to go out randomly one day to the Bellagio.
The point is its fun isn’t it? Once you break that seal its so easy to do, so go 
ahead and do the same exercise again, only this time step into your shoes 
and through it all as fully and completely as you can by getting extravagant, 
outrageous and make claims that are crazy and people will believe you.
Are you having fun?

25
Students:
Igor:
[
]
Igor:
Students:
Yes!
Now, let’s do something crazy, why is it that suddenly the energy and 
enthusiasm in the room went up the minute you didn’t have to constrain 
yourself to being any particular way? Just something to keep in the back of 
your mind and whatever it is you just did, I want you to do more of that over 
the next three days.
Once you get out into the real world its okay to start quieting it down again 
and finding a more realistic persona, but whilst you’re in here please get as 
extreme as you can whilst keeping it PG.
Laughter
No nudity please, no suggestion of nudity, no mining of sex act’s that’s not 
the kind of show we’re doing here right now, just put it out there. So are you 
guys having fun with this?
Yes.

What we’re going to do now is we’re going to start going into this as an 
actual, being a hypnotist kind of thing. 
Can I borrow you sir, seeing as you’re close? Give him a round of applause.
Applause
How are you, are you good?
Yes.
Look at me, take a deep breath and sleep all the way, deeper, deeper, 
deeper that’s right all the way. I’m going to stand you up and you’re going 
deeper into trance as you stand on your own balance now. That’s right, 
deeper and deeper into trance, deeper and deeper. Hand out stiff and rigid, 
stiff and rigid.
The stiffer it gets the more you feel good inside. The stiffer it gets the better of 
a hypnotist you become. The stiffer it gets the better of a hypnotist you 
become. Stiff and rigid right now. Try and bend the arm, try as hard as you 
can, and relax. All the way down. All the way down that’s right, very good.
You’re doing a great job and because you’ve done such a great job Sperling, 
I want you to know that you’re going to be absolutely amazing at this. You’re 
going to take to this like a duck to water. People are going to look at you and 
go man, have you done this before? Of course, you have but this time you’ll 
be doing even better than ever before.
So with that thought inside your mind, one-two-three coming out slowly. Four-
five eyes open wide awake and feeling good. How are you doing?
Good.
Excellent. Good job, off you go. Applause
Slowly but surely ease back into the real world. Who wants to learn how to do 
that? Just a few people. Some of you have done this already to some extent, 
so bear with us as we build this up. We will be going into new territory I 
assure you, but we want to be sure we pick it up right at the beginning so that 
everything comes smoothly.

27
The most important thing when you do any form of hypnosis is that you have 
to have the right context for hypnosis to occur. That could be the simplest 
thing, I am a hypnotist and people go oh, really? Do you have the right 
context now?
Yes.
Versus I’m a hypnotist, ah huh. Do you have the right context now? What’s 
missing?
Attention.
Right. In fact, if you say it the right way with the right person, you’ll have 
attention and the bypassing of the critical factor, the first three stages of 
hypnosis in the same place, so that’s all I want you guys to do is go around 
the room with as many different people as possible.
Let me borrow you again. All I want you to do is put your hand on their 
shoulders and start controlling them a little bit. Spread your feet lightly and 
look at me…that’s it…do I have his attention?
Yes.
Have I controlled that attention?
Yes.
So all I want you to do is put your hands on his shoulders, ask him for one act 
of compliance like spreading his feet apart, looking up at you just one act of 
compliance. Say please do this or if you want to have two that’s fine, now do 
this as well or adjust it this way.
Now look at me…that’s it. Is this difficult?
No.
Can anyone look at other people?
Yes.
All right, off you go.
Did you all enjoy that?
Yes.

Was it easy? Did anyone find that difficult? I should hope not, because this 
isn’t exactly rocket science, yet.
The next step is to make sure we’re looking for something now. 
Can I borrow you again? You’ll have to control them physically, so we’ll 
invade their space slightly because that puts them a little on edge and you 
want them there. You’ll control them physically, act for an act of compliance 
(come forward and look up at me).
I want you to look at and focus on their eyes until you see a slight shift. Can 
you see how his face has relaxed a little bit? He’s sinking down a little and is 
becoming a little more cataleptic, in other words, there’s less motion from 
him, he’s not doing the whole moving around and all these little mannerisms 
are disappearing. 
Can you all see that? These are the things we’re looking for, so once you 
have that there, all you need to do is take one of your hands, cup it on the 
back of his head like this and pressing a little. If they have glasses ask to 
borrow their glasses, tell them and then show them they’re going to be put 
somewhere safe, maybe in your pocket or a chair no one will be sitting on.
Take control of that for safety reasons. So, you’re here, take this hand put it 
on the back of their head and all you’re going to do now is tip that head 
forward until it touches your shoulder. Is that hard to do?
No.
A couple of warnings here. For one, don’t do this – whack- did everyone get 
that? Noses break easily. Foreheads are nice, smooth and soft and they’re 
designed to fit into shoulders, I don’t know why but it’s true, God designed us 
to be hypnotists. So make sure the forehead is guided into your shoulder, not 
the knobbly, elbowy hard bit on the corner, just the curvy part because it fits 
there naturally.
Have them there and that’s it. Gently, don’t yank them in or break their necks, 
just bring them in so you’re controlling their balance. Is that easy to do?
Yes.
We have a question.
What if you’re vertically challenged, like I am and somebody is a foot taller 
than you?
The first thing to do is work with someone like Sperling and then you’ll realize 
that you can do anything. If you’re going to have someone slightly larger, just 
take half a step back so that you can brace yourself. 

29
All you’re going to do at this point is bring them in, take a step back so you 
can take the weight and slide them in gently until you have it right where you 
want it. Now, even then you don’t have to go the whole way. If they’re really 
tall you may want to sit them down, that’s fine too. 
You don’t actually have to drag them down, you just have to make sure they 
start coming forward a little, even if you don’t take their balance at that point 
that’s fine, but for most people you’ll be able to do it quite comfortably from 
your shoulder without any problems.
Does that answer your question?
Yes, thank you.
Any other questions?
I want to add something to that. I get that a lot because I’m vertically 
challenged a lot. I’m not a tall guy, although I work with a lot of really big 
people so I want to add another dimension to that. I know you’re doing this 
soft thing, I’m going to borrow your subject one more time…another thing you 
can do where they don’t even have to come down…oftentimes, I’ll just say 
look right here and sleep.
I’ll hold their heads like that and it makes it real easy to do.
These things are easy and we will play with other mechanics as we go along.
I just wanted to address that because it’s easy to do so there are a lot of 
different tricks you can do or mechanics you can do.
All right, for a moment just get used to a simple mechanics like this one and 
we’ll start playing elaboration. And by the way, if you prefer that version just 
go with that and adapt whatever we’re doing, it’ll be really easy.
Does everyone know what they’re doing? If so, just to confirm…
Number 1- Control them
Number 2- Get compliance 
Number 3- Eye contact
Number 4- Look for that state of focus to start to develop
Number 5- Cup your hand on the back of their necks and gently 
guide them into shoulder
That’s it; you don’t have to do anything else. Is that easy?
Yes.

Off you go –exercise-
Stay where you are and face the front. Is that easy so far?
Yes.
Okay. We have hand and shoulders, now we’re going to bring him forward. At 
this point we’re going to do something crazy. I hope this isn’t too advanced 
for you. We’re going to speak to him at the same time.
Look at me…sleep. That’s right deeper, all the way. On the count of five 
coming back, one-two-three, you’re almost there now. Take a deep breath, 
four and five, eyes open, wide awake. Good job, well done you.
Applause
I get all the love.
Laughter
Does that seem difficult to do? I don’t care what you do afterwards, all I care 
about is you do the same stuff you did a moment ago, only this time as you’re 
guiding them forwards you just say the word sleep, that’s it. They, of course, 
will pretend to go into trance for the moment and we’ll start elaborating and 
refining as we go on.
Right now I just want you to get used to that as a dynamic. Does that make 
sense? Any questions? Off you go, thank you very much. –Exercise- This is 
way too easy isn’t it?
Yes.
Good. Is anyone struggling with this so far, it should be pretty 
straightforward? 
Here’s what we’re going to do now, we’re going to start on the same thing but 
we’re going to get a little more hypnotic. 
(Can I borrow you for a moment, since you’re close?) So, you have the same 
setup. Behind their shoulders, take a step forward please, look at me, take a 
deep breath in, breathe out and sleep, all the way. That’s right.
At this point, I just wanted to add some simple language. Let’s go deeper, 
deeper, deeper, that’s right, deeper, that’s right, deeper. Is my language 
particularly complex right now? 
Laughter

31
In a moment I’ll count from one to five and on the count of five you’ll come 
back refreshed, alert, simply fantastic. 
One, coming up slowly
Two, a little bit more now
Three, feeling revitalized, refreshed
Four, getting ready to meet your new day
Five, coming back as a full powerful hypnotist ready to rock n’ roll
Applause
Is that easy so far? 
Yes.
Put your hands up if you have a question.
Real quick, I noticed when you’re cupping behind the head that you tap 
sometimes, but you didn’t mention that.
Don’t worry about the tapping yet, we’ll come to that. It’s hypno-tapping. 
Would it be normal to be a little bit nervous doing the rapid induction?
Sure, until you get used to it. Here’s the thing, if you’re not trying to achieve 
anything how will you get nervous? You’re not looking for results yet and yes, 
in the real world, until you get used to it you’ll be a little nervous and then 
you’ll start doing it.
For now, just treat it like going to a weird gym, like hold the exercise machine 
like this and pull the lever forward. Then push it back and hope for results, 
just think about those pure mechanics don’t think about hypnosis or anything 
else like that and it should take care of that for now. By the time you actually 
get to do the real hypnosis it’ll be easy.
Is that okay? Very good. Any other questions or comments? No, all right can I 
borrow you for a second. Then the other thing I want you to focus on…you’ve 
done the whole sleep thing, I know the complex language deeper, deeper, 
deeper…whilst they’re here what I want you to do is feel the shoulder and the 
back of their neck for how relaxed they are.
(Tense up a second) Do you see the tension here? If I step away, do you see 
how he stands on his own? (Now relax, all the way, that’s it). Now, you can 
already see his shoulders relaxing a little bit. If I start stepping away, do you 
see how his body follows me? I can feel the weight on me, does that make 
sense?
[

32
Every time he starts relaxing a bit more or puts his weight a bit more on top of 
your shoulders so you can feel it, just say something like that’s right, 
encourage him or say you’re doing great, something along those lines. What 
you’re looking for is the whole mechanics we had there, but notice where the 
relaxation is.
If they’re really tense, don’t worry about it. If they’re really relaxed that’s fine 
too. We’re not looking for it all we want you to do is to spot what’s actually 
happening. Does that make sense? 
This means you should do this with as many different people as possible, 
because every one will be different and what you need right now is a variety 
of experience. So don’t elaborate these things, take no more then 30 
seconds, move on to someone else and so on, you’re really better served 
with a lot of practice rather than spending a long time with one person.
I want you to be aware of one thing. When he’s talking about the relaxation, 
there will be times when you’re doing this with somebody and they’re so 
relaxed that they’re going to fall to the ground. It’s up to you to make sure you 
take care of them at all times.
So, if you have somebody and you see them start to collapse or feel them 
start to collapse, you want to take control, make sure they’re not going to fall 
and tell them your legs are stiff and rigid. I’m telling you it will happen.
So just look out for it for now. A moment again, notice to what levels you get. 
You shouldn’t be getting to that extreme just yet, but soon you will be so keep 
that in the back of your minds as an idea.
All right, off you go.
Was that easy?
Yes!
Remember, you are the show. The energy you bring to this is how your show 
will be, so I strongly encourage you to train that getting excited muscle if you 
want the audience to be that way as well. It’s just part of how it is. I don’t 
mind, we’re going to do a good job whichever way it goes.
But this is for you to train your whole state and personality, remember that’s 
part of what you’re doing here. 
Who felt different levels of relaxation with different people? Who felt that 
when you said something like that’s right, you’re doing great or deeper, at the 
right time the relaxation increased? Guess what, that makes you a hypnotist. 
Seriously!
Spencer:
Igor:
Students:

33
Relaxation isn’t the only way to hypnotize it’s just one of the simpler pathways 
into it. Does that make sense? We’ll cover lots of other ways of doing it in 
time too, but this is a very useful way of looking at it.
What I want you to do now is the same thing; we’re just going to add a few 
nuances, will that be okay?
Yes.
Can I borrow you, seeing that you’re close.
We have Merrick right here; we’ll do the same drill. Take a step forward or 
just take a step back. Look at me. Take a deep breath in and sleep all the 
way, that’s right. Deeper, deeper, deeper, that’s right deeper still, very good. 
What I want you to do here as he’s there going deeper into trance, I want you 
to test and feel for his balance just by slightly rocking backwards and 
forwards. Notice how much balance you have and if there’s not enough just 
lift him up a little bit until you’re balanced. 
If there’s not enough, you see how he doesn’t rock with me, I just say that’s it 
just let me have it. That’s it, a little more, that’s it there you go. So you’re 
going to encourage him to give you his balance. If he trusts you with his 
balance, chances are he’ll trust you with whatever internal process is going 
on too.
This is just a starting point. Now, coming back 1-2-3-4-5 rock n’ roll, good job 
well done.
Applause
One last thing, in terms of what you do with the head be gentle. If you’re 
going to do more of a shocking thing, you have two choices. 
1. Do it a-la the master whom you’ll see doing it very shortly. It’s just, 
take the hand on the shoulder, the shoulder can take more force then 
the head can. But again, don’t be jerking too hard.
This is my preference, especially when you’re working with more fragile 
people. 
2. Take one of your fingers and just have the cup of the hand there for 
stability, but only one finger does the pushing. So literally, if this is his 
head I’m just letting one finger do the tapping, because one finger 
won’t have that much power in it to wrench his neck out of proportion.

You do not want to be going sleep and the head goes rolling down the other 
end of the aisle and their body collapses in a spurt of blood, that’s a lawsuit 
waiting to happen, so you probably don’t want to have that. 
So we added two things. First, we’re putting a little more shock into the 
system. The simple way to do that is when you cup, just use your index, 
middle or ring finger to tap forward slightly and if he resists that’s no problem, 
you see how he’s resisting, there’s still a little bit of shock so you can still go 
from here and gently carry on guiding with the whole hand. It is not a yank 
with the whole hand.
Have I emphasized this one enough?
Yes.
What is it not?
It’s not using the whole hand.
What is it?
It’s a finger.
I have a question with regards to their style, like usually when I do this I sync 
with my object and then I go slow, but I can’t be really forceful.
Pretend for a moment that you are. Imagine one of these guys here who’s 
done it with you. Who here is okay with just being a bit more forceful, excited 
and so on? Grab her and everyone focus on her until she gets it. You’ll get it 
very soon. And then, all you have to do is be like them. Once you’ve had it a 
few times you’ll go oh, that’s easy I can do that.
For now we’re still working with mechanics, so the key here is you have all 
this stuff here. Hand cupped, little tip for a little shock, guide them in and say 
the word sleep, then the rest and you’ll be looking for the balance. Simple, 
easy, off you go. 
How are you doing, are you having fun?
Yes! Applause
Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. These are just the core mechanics of 
an instant induction. Next we’re going to look into exactly what’s going on 
here, the dynamics you’re looking for, so that every time you do it you can tell 
is this work or is it not so you know how to troubleshoot and fix it.

So next we’ll look at the mental dynamics behind the physical mechanics 
we’ve just been doing. Then we’re going to start drilling this in with variations 
so you have lots of different exciting instant inductions that make people go 
oh, that guy’s amazing. 
In fact, my aim is that by lunchtime you can do such good hypnosis that when 
you go out there, there are lots of conferences going on, have you seen this. 
Do I need say anything more? That’s my aim for lunchtime is that a good 
aim?

Inductions

Students:
Igor:
Failsafe Instant Inductions
All right, let me try that again. Are you guys having fun?
Yes!
Okay, what we’re going to do today is we’re going to focus a little bit on the 
mental dynamics of what you were doing just now, and then we’ll give you
more practice on those principles in actions. Does that sound fair?
First, what are you trying to achieve with all this convoluted rigmarole and 
so on? In the simplest way – and this is why a lot of people are afraid of 
instant inductions. Here’s what tends to happen.
If we can call this line normal consciousness, down here’s trance, up here is 
regular consciousness. What tends to happen is when we get a shock, 
when we’re alert in some way, the unconscious mind doesn’t know how to 
deal with it so you trance it out for a second to figure out, where do I look to 
find out how to deal with the situation?
The startle reflex won’t kick this is. Anything that startles you will basically,
reset the mind for a split second, which means it started unconsciousness. 
Make sense?
Here’s the problem. Here’s why people are afraid of instant inductions. This 
does not last very long because when a bus is speeding at you, you don’t 
need to be there half an hour to figure out whether or not this thing that’s 
coming towards you is healthy. So this doesn’t last very long. It’s a split 
second, sometimes a couple of seconds depending on the person. 
What then tends to happen is they’ll slowly start to return. Now at this stage, 
most hypnotists go, oh man, I messed up. When if all you do is go, sleep, 
damn it I messed up again, well of course you did because you got them to 
the right point, but you didn’t keep them there. Does that make sense?
So then we have the language like deeper and deeper. We’ll play more with 
actual language later on. What that does is it stabilizes them underneath 
the line. In other words, it keeps them in that slightly trance-like state. Does 
that make sense to everyone?

37
As a rule, two things you need to bear in mind with instant inductions are–
1. With 90% of the people you’ll meet, just things like doing a little jolt of 
some sort – a gentle one – and then sleep gets them there. Then 
immediately you roll into, that’s right, deeper and deeper, relaxing 
more, that’s it, give me more of your balance, or whatever you want 
to say to stabilize.
2. Sometimes, people are still a little bit scared. You may have 
misjudged them before you actually got to that place. If you’ve 
misjudged it, do you know what you do at that point? Then you go, 
sleep, and they’ll go, what? You just carry it right on. 
You say, that’s right, sleep. And again, sleep. And again, sleep. Do 
you want a quick demo of what I mean by that?
Yes.
Could I have a resistance subject please? A resistance, someone who can 
resist. I know I’m charming. There you go. Come on up. Give him a round of 
applause for being a real meany.
Applause
Part the resistance, and we’ll talk about it in Street Hypnosis, how to not set 
a frame up so they fight you, but it might be that he’s still a bit concerned or 
scared and he doesn’t know what to do. So when you say, that’s it, just 
spread your feet a little bit apart. Look at me. Take a deep breath, and 
sleep. 
Oh no, I failed. That’s it. Just sleep. Close your eyes. Sleep all the way. 
That’s it. Relax and sleep all the way. Relax. Relax. Sleep all the way. 
That’s it. You’re doing great. That’s it, deeper, deeper and deeper now. I’m 
going to count from 1-5, on the count of 5, eyes open, wide awake, feeling 
absolutely amazing.
1 – Coming up slowly. 2 - 3 - and as you’re coming through your body – 4 –
and 5 – eyes open, wide awake. Great job. Well done. 
Give him a round of applause.
Applause
You saw resistance, right? The point is if you keep going and you have that 
mannerism and say its okay. Whatever’s going to happen will be fine 
eventually, they’ll get the hint of like, oh, I know what I’m supposed to do. I

close my eyes, I relax and I let myself fall into this experience. That’s all. 
Does that make sense?
Does this make sense as a basic template of what you’re doing during 
these inductions? If you understand this, you can do any instant induction 
that you’ll ever come across, seriously.
Was it you that did the mobile phone induction? It’s pretty much like that. 
Somebody else’s eyeballs. Look into their eyes.
We’re going to just add a few more refinements onto that because again 
with the stage experience you’ll want to add a few more principles which 
are really important. Then we’re going to do a lot of drilling to get this into 
you, so it’s so much second nature that you actually start hypnotizing 
people when you shake their hand and be like sleep, oh I didn’t mean it
sorry, come back. 
I want to build on this a little bit. When he’s talking about how the mind goes 
down here – because in the subconscious mind, what kind of a mind is it? 
It’s a yes mind. The subconscious mind does whatever it’s told within 
reason. Correct? Do you guys know that? 
So when you do the rapid induction, what’s happening is the mind is going 
– because you take the body, basically, it’s going, where am I going, when 
you take it off of, its motion. The mind is going, what’s happening? So when 
it’s saying what’s happening, you’re saying sleep. Then it goes oh, okay. 
Got it. So that’s why the rapid induction works so quickly. Does that make 
sense? 
Somebody come up here. It doesn’t matter who it is. Yeah, come on up 
here. Just to show what that’s like. So when you have somebody – yeah, 
you can take your glasses off. Thanks. 
So when you’re doing that – and it doesn’t matter who you’re working with, 
it’s the same thing. The principle is like this. Just sleep. So what happens is 
– open your eyes – is the same thing is happening, is that you’re just – I tell 
people don’t snap your fingers like what you do to a dog, but I do it anyway. 
It looks good.
But it’s the same thing. You just say, look right here. Take a deep breath. 
Just sleep. So what happens is that when they’re coming down, the mind is 
going, well, what do I do? It’s looking for direction. Stand up. Right away. 
There you go. So it’s the same principle. Okay? 
I can’t impress that upon you more. The subconscious is a yes mind, so 
when you do this rapid induction, like this you just keep building on it. So 
Student:
Igor:
Spencer:

39
when you keep giving suggestions, like sleep, that’s it, relax and go even 
deeper loosely, limply rocks, that’s good. There you go. That’s very good. 
Loosely, limply relax.
When you’re doing something like that, you’re just deepening the 
suggestions. It’s a compounding effect. One suggestion builds upon 
another one. Open your eyes, wide awake. Very good. Now you notice I 
didn’t say I’m going to count to five, wide awake. I just said open your eyes, 
wide awake. 
Is the trance terminated? 
Yes. No.
Ain’t gonna happen.
Nobody knows yet. 
It doesn’t happen. I never terminate trance. I don’t terminate. When I begin 
working with somebody, I never terminate the formal type of trance because 
the formal trance termination, which is what a lot of people do – in a 
moment, I’m going to count from 1-5. I will say fully aware. At that time 
you’ll be fully awake, feeling fantastic in every way, or whatever you want to 
pile onto that. 
So I just say sleep, very good, cool. If I want to go further than that, I could 
just say make your arm stiff and rigid. Make a fist for me if you would, 
please. Very good. Make that arm stiff and rigid and powerful. So, stiff and 
so rigid and so powerful that you cannot bend that arm, try to bend it. The
arm will not bend. It’s stuck up there. 
Try as hard as you can. Reach over there and grab it. Try to pull it down. 
There you go. There you go. Try to pull it down. It’s stuck. It won’t come 
down. There you go. Isn’t that crazy? Tap you on the head, drop to your 
side. Go ever deeper to sleep. You see there? So that just becomes a 
compound technique. So you’re just building on it. 
Each time a person responds to a suggestion, it makes it easier for them to 
respond to future suggestions, right? Open your eyes, wide awake. 
We’ll get more into that later. I just wanted to share that with you very 
quickly. When you’re doing the rapid type of induction, the subconscious 
mind is a yes mind. You’re saying sleep, and the individual goes, okay. 
I build up that later on in the class, but I wanted you to have that idea in 
your mind on what’s going on psychologically. Thanks. Give Bill a round of 
applause. Make him feel good.

Pretty cool so far?

Are you glad you came?
Yes!
Good, now go home. I like that. Who said no? You can stay, all right? 
Everyone else, sorry. What we’re going to do now– may aim is by lunchtime 
to get you to do what you just saw happening here, would you like to do 
that?
Yes.
That requires speed drilling and just going for it over and over again. If you 
get the words slightly wrong no big deal, you just want to create the 
instincts for this. Does that make sense? 
Yes.
Okay. Everyone stand up please, with all the chairs to one side. 
As you’re moving your chairs over there, I’m going to talk to you for a 
moment, so go ahead and keep moving your chairs.
Keep moving your chairs over there as we talk.
Because there is going to be another dimension of this that we will go into 
later. I promise you.
All the chairs on that side please.
Because right now what’s happening is you’re learning some hypnotic 
inductions with who, a room full of hypnotists, right.
And, of course, at some point to be working with non-hypnotists. 
Non-hypnotists, and so you’re going to find the experience may be a little bit 
different. So we’re going to go into the dynamics of that later of what you do 
in the real world with real people, and how to overcome situations where 
maybe you’re going to have to really tweak that instant induction by creating 
rapport, and we’ll talk about that later.

41
Igor:
Absolutely. So for the moment let’s just drill in the skills. Once your chairs 
are over there, please everyone come back to the center. Leave a corner in 
the middle for the camera.

Induction Speed Drill 1
Now, what we’d like you to do is please separate yourself into four columns, 
four rows, roughly equal number. It doesn’t matter who’s in which one just 
four rows. Just organize yourself so we’ll have – why don’t you stand over 
here. 
One row behind this young man, one row right behind Linda, one row over 
here and we’ll have one row right behind you here. Everyone else line up 
behind these four people please, in just roughly the same numbers. 
Two more lines over here.
That’s it. One line here and one line right here. Come on forward.
One, two, three four.
Okay, line up behind these buys.
We need six lines then. Six equal lines. 
Six equal lines. So, just line up over there. This line, you guys turn and face 
each other. You guys turn and face each other. You guys turn and face 
each other.
Make sure you have a partner. If there is no partner, move. Make sure 
there’s a partner right in front of you. If not, then move over.
Wait a second. Just make sure that you’re partnered up with someone. If 
you are, just shake hands with the person you’ll be working with. There you 
go. Do you need someone?
Is there anybody without somebody?
You guys, everyone shake hands with the person across from you, and 
then put your hand up if you do not have a partner. Everyone have a 
partner? All right we’re going to have a lot of fun here. This is drilling time, 
folks. 
This line right here is going to stay static. So this line right here, this line 
right here is going to stay static. This line right here will stay exactly where 
you are. The second line, the one I haven’t touched yet, this line over here, 
second line, second line. You guys facing this wall, you’ll be moving around 
one each cycle.

So what we’re going to do is if you just walk to the end and everyone moves 
down one, just go ahead and move there. Everyone move down one. The 
same with you, Martin, just move to the end. Everyone move down one. 
Move to the end. Everyone move down one. 
If you’ve ever done speed dating, you know what we’re doing. 
Laughter
This is how hypnotists speed date. Guys or girls, it doesn’t matter. This is 
Vegas after all. All right, so you get the idea of this? Folks, just pay attention 
a second. You get the idea of this so far, right?
Yes.
What we’re looking for here is speed and smoothness. So let’s that try 
again. Front row move on around. That’s it, quickly. Move down quickly, as 
quickly as possible. All right and do it one more. Move one down. Okay
good. Pause, folks. Don’t worry about introducing yourselves yet. All right, 
pause, everyone. 
For this exercise, please do not concern yourself about introductions. In 
other words, just pretend that they’re there to be hypnotized and go straight 
for the hypnosis. The reason for this is we don’t want too much setup, chit 
chat and everything else. We want trance and trance after trance. Does that 
make sense to everyone?
Yes.
The only thing you’ll do – and for people who are wearing glasses, you may 
want to take them off if you can see okay. Otherwise, if you want to keep 
them on, make sure that you take the glasses off your partner before you 
start the trance when you go in. 
My preference is you keep them off. You’ll probably lose them up there as 
well, so keep them off. Maybe pop them to the side somewhere. You can 
put them on the stage and they’ll be safe or you can put them in your 
pocket, but make sure they’re somewhere where they can’t go flying 
anywhere. Does that make sense?
Yes.
So everyone, if you have short sight and you have your hands up, then you 
can’t put your hand up, right? Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to 
start with exactly what you did a moment ago, which means – I’m standing 
opposite Collin. This side’s going to be the hypnotist first; that side will be 
the hypnotist second.

I’m going to assume I have everything already. The only thing I’m going to 
do is – he’s not even going to be looking at me. The only thing we’re going 
to do is put my hands on. That tells you I’m good to go. 
Sleep. All the way down, deeper, deeper. That’s right, deeper. Good. Eyes 
open, wide awake. Excellent, well done! Then he’ll do the same to me, then 
we’ll switch round and the next one goes round. Does that make sense? It’s 
very simple. 
I want you to listen to our voices. The reasons are:
1. We’ll be saying things as you go along. Don’t worry about them too 
much. Just let them wash over you.
2. When I say switch, it means the person in the front over here, here 
and here will go to the back and everyone moves down as quickly as 
possible. If you haven’t had a go yet, that means you have to go 
faster. Make sense?
Yes.

here? Can you count out say 1-2-3 and so forth? Responses with 
numbers by rows
-Mixing it up, organizing rows.-
Let’s have 3 cups without water given to the last person on the left hand 
side. Everyone with a cup in the air, you are the end-point and the start 
point, the Alpha and Omega. What we’re going to do is a competition. In 
other words, he will trance him out, he will go the opposite and as soon as 
you’re done you’ll race to the back, everyone moves one down.
Your aim is to get the person with the cup to the front as quickly as possible 
without skipping a single person. Does that make sense?
Yes.
This will be mayhem I warn you. Folks, wait. I strongly recommend that as 
you do this you pay extra attention to their balance, because people will 
start to go at this point.
Control their balance. Make sure they’re safe above all else, but move the 
lines as quickly as possible. Any questions? Both people have a go. No one 
gets left behind. Are we ready for this?
Yes.
Off you go.
It’s getting close folks. Those cup bearers are coming forwards. The 
Olympic flame is almost ready to pop, who’s going to make it? Quickly, 
speed up. The faster you go the more likely you are to win. The cups 
coming closer to the end.
For $1 million dollars. Oh boy, here goes.
The last few people are up.
Almost, I think we have a winner.

You truly are the fastest hypnotists in Vegas. 
It’s okay. The rest of you guys have a chance to claim back your honor

Instant Induction Number 2
What we’re going to do now is we’re going to start going into different styles 
of instant inductions, just so you see the same principles in action. We’re 
going to break it down, bit by bit. Do you want to take the first bit?
Come on up here. There are other thing’s that you can do when you have 
something you can just be next to them and you’ve got a nice little hold on 
them, you’re making sure they’re not going to fall over. 
Look right here, and just sleep. So it’s another way that you can do an 
instant induction, wide awake. Did you see that? I say look right here. Take 
a deep breath in, and just sleep. It’s really a very simple technique. 
Now I’m watching a lot of you guys out there, and when you’re doing this 
you’re going, sleep, and you can do that very gently, and that’s cool, but do 
you want to be very dramatic? Look right here. SLEEP! So you can be a 
little more dramatic, and I’m telling you something, that when you add in 
that element of SLEEP, what happens is they go, oh shit, okay, whatever 
you say! 
No kidding, because you’re shocking the nervous system. The nervous 
system is part of the autonomic part of your conscious mind that says, yes 
sir. It knows that you mean business.
Wide awake. Okay, did you guys see that? Do you want to see it one more 
time? 
Yes.
Let me see how your hand is?
How my hand is? 
Turn around. Do it backwards. Turn so you’re facing backwards. There you 
go. 
Here’s the rear end. It’s just like you’re out on a date. That’s all it is. It’s my 
date. 
Damn.
The instant butt induction. How are you doing?
I’m good.

So it’s the same thing. You want to do this because it looks good, but you 
can just go, SLEEP. So I’m just going to give you a little pull. Just, SLEEP. 
You guys got that? Front and back. Turn around. One more time; sleep. 
Okay, wide awake. 
So it’s just going to be three simple phases. 
1. Put your hand around them to feel their balance.
2. Pull them in and say, sleep.
3. Lift their hand up at the same time to create a little bit of eye 
distraction. 
Is that simple? What I want you to do is stay in the line you’re in now. 
You’re not going to move around. You’re going to do backwards and 
forwards a few times to get used to it. Then we’ll start the competition 
again. 
And don’t worry if the person next to you is bigger than you are. That does 
not matter. Just put your arms around their waist and say, sleep. So you 
can do the same thing with your arm around their waist or on their shoulder. 
It doesn’t matter. Just remember that you are the one who’s controlling the 
scenario. 
Okay, any questions so far? Can we have some microphones here, please? 
Run rabbit. Okay, it’s not necessary to shake hands with your partner again. 
Put your hand up if you have no partner. Did we lose someone half way 
through? There you go. So go ahead.
The question is when we leave here and we start to do it to people…
We won’t do that. With other people, we’ll talk about this later. For now, 
we’ll just get used to the drill, and we’ll add those bits and pieces in later. 
Make sense? 
Left hand or right hand? 
Who cares? Seriously, who cares? All right. Are we good? Everyone ready? 
So with a partner – are you missing someone. 
He’s right there.
Oh, he was hiding. You scared him, didn’t you? All right, guys do three or 
four one way. So you’ll do three or four in one go, then you’ll do three or 
four in one go. Just get used to the dynamics, and then when we’re ready, 
we’ll start the competition again. We’ll move the cup to the back and see 
how quickly they can come forward. Does that make sense to everyone? 
So let’s start the first round first. 

49
So this side to three first in a row, and then the other side will do three in a 
row. Then we’ll pause, and we’ll actually start the competition up again. 
Ready to go? Off you go.
Okay, everyone. Just pause. Has everyone had three or four go’s? Yes? All 
right, is this easy to do? 
Yes.
Did you notice how you have to be extra careful on this one to maintain 
people’s balance? This is something you have to learn as a hypnotist. So 
feel it, get used to it and just do it. 
So who’s got the cups right now? Put the cups up in the air please. Did you 
get rid of your cup? There you go. All right, move the cups to the back of 
the room. Cups in the back. We’ve got two cups. All right, that’s cheating. 
Give me that cup. That’s my cup.

Anyone? Put your hand up? Do you feel nervous? Anyone? All right this is

we do the language?
Go ahead and go to the language.

51
Master Hypnotic Language
Igor:
Students:
Okay. We’ll step it down a pace. The magic cups can go away again. Now, 
again, those of you who have trained with me before will be familiar with 
this exercise. We just want to get to the idea of language now so you’ll start 
knowing how to speak as a hypnotist, as opposed to just how to perform 
like one. Does that make sense? 
Both are important. If you’re not performing like one, well then, the words 
themselves won’t do anything. If you have the words to back up your 
performance, of course, they get more powerful. 
Let’s see how to speak like hypnotists. Everyone just come forward, crowd 
into here please. Make sure you leave a nice space in the middle though, a
nice little corridor right here. Pretend the chairs are still there. Feel free to 
pop to this side.
Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to start playing with the power 
words, and I know you’re kind of becoming familiar with them. So you’ll get 
to go crazy with them. 
For those of you who are not familiar with power words, it’s just a way of 
speaking hypnotically using the language of the unconscious. Essentially, 
the unconscious mind reasons through association, did you know that 
before? Well, you do now.
We’re going to have words that allow you to associate one idea with 
another, and that allows you to smoothly flow between things. The first word 
I would like you to do use, because it’s simple, is the word 
. It 
allows you to link two ideas, which may not necessarily be linked. 
To keep it simple and keep it easy, what I want you guys to do is go around 
the room and tell people just the milling exercise at the beginning, just talk 
them and link any random idea with any other random idea through the 
word 
. The key here is to make it random. 
Don’t try to make sense of this. Don’t try to be sensible. It can be as garbled 
as hey, Colin, because you’re standing here, the sky’s going to fall down on 
my head. It doesn’t matter what you’re saying. What I want you to get to the 
point of is where your mind doesn’t quite know what’s going to come out of 
your mouth next. All that you know is that somewhere this word will turn up. 
Does that make sense to everyone? 
Yes.

the better you’ll do in this course. Easy?

you look at me, you’ll be a great hypnotist.
you walk outside, there will be people there that you can 
hypnotize. Shock- horror.
Now that makes a little bit too much sense, so we might go with something 
more like:
a deer comes into the room, the butterflies have 
starvation problems. 
Seriously, I’d like you to initially become very random with this because it 
forces your brain into a different cycle. Can you feel your brains working, 
guys? Yes? So is that easy to do? 
XY. Everyone understand 
this?
Yes.
All right. Off you go.
Is that easy to do?
Yes.
Okay. So let’s do another one –

Those doors are there,

There a carp in this room, 
you will have flowers in your 
ceiling. I don’t know why, but it does.
Is that easy to do? So shall we make it a little bit more challenging? Let’s do 
all three at once. 
you’re listening here, it means the butterflies outside are 
having a happy time. W
you speak something random, they 
will smile, 
that you’ll learn hypnosis more easily than 
ever before. 
Easy to do? You do not – let me emphasize this – you do not want to be 
making sense at all. So, I apologize if I made a bit too much sense there, as 
random as possible, that’s what we’re looking for. Is that easy?
Yes.
All right. Off you go. 
All right, easy.
No.
All right. Your brains should be whirling at a crazy mile an hour, but at least 
the language is starting to pop out. Is that right? Yes? Good. Fine. You’re 
exercising your brain, which is good.
We’re going to add one more layer. The phrase 
, or better still, 
For example:
those butterflies 
you to relax. 
You’re here 
the sky is purple. 
the sky is purple, 
people stand around, 
they’re looking at things, and 
that those people that you are a part of 
to look at those 
things in ways that are purple.
So, again, it doesn’t need to make sense. I hope what I’m saying is not 
making sense because if it is, then you guys need to stop taking whatever 
you’re taking. 
What I want you to do is go through those four in a cycle, again, not making 
sense. Then we’ll start turning it in to something more hypnotic. Is that 
good? Easy to do? Again, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. Your 
brain is just beading up. You should feel it like right on the edge of 
something. Like you’re about to fall off something.

That’s perfect. Especially as stage hypnotists, you want – in fact, you need 
to be able to think on your feet because lots of stuff will be happening, and 
this gets your brain ready for it. Make sense? Off you go. 
All right, guys wow! You guys are picking this up way quicker than usual. I 
like this. We’re going to have to do this like crazy, running people around 
these drills more often. 
This is pretty straightforward now. Your brains are kind of working extra 
time trying to figure out what to say in the middle of it because it’s going to 
be random, but the language itself is straightforward, isn’t it? 
Now I thought we’d make it a little bit easier for you guys. Do you remember 
the XY construction? Because the butterflies are out there flying in their
cycle, you’ll find that the Trumps and Donald are lower than you expect. 
So now what we’re going to do is take the same idea, but we’re going to 
make life easy. We’re going to start with something totally random. Why? 
Because when you’re on the stage, random things can happen, but I want 
to start utilizing it to move it towards something purposeful. 
What do we mean by terms like purposeful as a hypnotist? Well, when 
you’re in trance – did anyone when you did the whole trance thing feel a 
little bit more relaxed, yes anyone? Maybe get your hands up a little bit. Do 
you feel good? Do you have like a warm – not warm, but a glow and feel-
good feelings? Do you feel some kind of deepening process, like it 
intensifies whatever experience you had? 
So these are what we call deepeners. They make the experience they’re 
having more so. Here, we have some very simple themes. Relax, comfort, 
deeper and feel good those are the kinds of experiences you’ve been 
having whilst you’ve been going in and out of trances. 
Yes.
Thank you very much. So what you’re going to do now is exactly the same 
exercise. The X will be totally random – butterflies, purple-headed pygmies 
– I don’t care, whatever. The Y will be anything in this list. These are called 
trance themes. These themes make people feel more like they’re in trance. 
Does that make sense? So for example, 
Because those purple headed pygmies are outside waiting, it means you 
can... 
Relax.
And whenever you see a fantastic velvet mannequin, you will…

Relax.
There we go. 
Which means…?
You can go deeper.
Thank you and I know that you want to…
Relax.
Now is that difficult?
No.
No? It should be a lot easier than the last exercise. Remember, just keep 
half of it random – we’ll fill that in later – and half of it will be purposeful 
around the idea of deepening, trancing and so on. Make sense? 
Okay, spend two or three cycles with the same person, so you’re going 
through the whole list, in any order, I don’t care, two or three times with one 
person. They’ll do you and then you’ll go onto the next person. Make 
sense? Off you go. 
Are you guys enjoying this?
Yes!
It’s easy to do now, isn’t it? Isn’t this easier to do now that you actually have 
to make sense, rather than when you’re not. Isn’t that crazy? Half the time 
people are afraid of, how can I make this make sense? Actually, it’s easier 
to make than not, so you may as well, right? I know I can’t help it. 
Why are we doing this? This is the essence of hypnotic language. You 
realize that these words, there’s no magic behind them as they are? In 
other words, you don’t have to burn these into your mind and only use 
these. They’re examples of words that allow you to associate one idea to 
another. Does that make sense?
If you want more power words, there’s a deck of cards in the back called, 
The Street Hypnosis Deck. They have lots of examples. You can make your 
own now because you can come up with phrases like, more of this and 
more of that, sooner or later. These are all phrases you can kind of up 
make up on your own. 

56
Deeper Trances
What we’re going to do now is start using these purposely in terms of your 
hypnotic process. Hands up if you can do an instant induction. That should 
be all the hands right now because you’ve been doing it all morning. Are 
you a little bit afraid? Then I have a great exercise just for you coming up 
after lunch. I’m going to remember. Don’t worry. 
So you can do an instant induction. Remember, the bit that matters on the 
instant induction is not the induction, it’s what you do immediately 
afterwards. You want to keep that firm in your mind. It does not matter what 
I do for the induction. It’s what I follow up with that counts. 
The induction is easy. It’s like can anyone say the word sleep?
Sleep!
With conviction. I like that. The actual induction is not difficult, is it? So what 
we’re going to do now is stabilize the trance. How are we going to do this? 
Well, exactly how you just did there, which is you’re going to take one idea 
and one experience and associate it to something else. 
What kind of things would you want them to associate, or what kind of 
experience would you want them to have to stay more in this trance? This is 
technically known as deepening. 
Can I just borrow you guys for a minute? Face this lovely crowd over here. 
Take a deep breath. Sleep. All the way down, deeper. That’s right. 
Deeper and deeper because whenever you feel that relaxation 
becoming more comfortable, you’ll go deeper into trance, which 
means your amazing capacity to be a great hypnotist improves and 
skyrockets. So you may as well feel all that comfort growing stronger 
and stronger now. 
The stronger it feels, the more you relax. The more you relax, the 
better you feel. The better you feel, the wider your mind opens to 
becoming a great hypnotist and you know what I mean by that, don’t 
you? Very good. In a moment, I’m going to move you up so you have 
your own balance, but stay deep in trance. 
That’s right. There we go. Every time you feel this, you can just go 
deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. 
Do you see the association from one thing to the other? 
Students:
Igor:

57
And every time you feel this, your rate of confidence as a hypnotist 
just grows stronger and stronger and stronger. 
Notice how now I’m doing physically the same thing that you just did with 
language earlier on.
And you can relax. That’s right. Relaxing even more, that’s right, 
even more deeply. Each time you feel this, that’s right, deeper. 
That’s right, deeper. That’s right, deeper. 
Notice how we’re just doing simple movements. You can add the physical. 
It can actually be just intellectual in terms of the ideas.
Which means, you’re going to be even more comfortable, relaxed 
and ready to absorb all these hypnotic lessons and learning’s, just 
you wait to get back to school. Those kids will not know what hit 
them. That’s right. You can imagine that now, can you not? Enjoy it. 
That’s good. 
In a moment, I’m going to count from 1-3. At the count of 3, eyes 
open, wide awake. 1-2-3, eyes open. 
Good job. Give him a nice round of applause. 
Applause
Well done. Now everything you just saw, that’s not rocket science, is it? 
You can do all that. So what I want you to do now is exactly this. Spend like 
a minute or so with each person and then move on again. Volume will be 
more important right now. 
What I want you to do is put them in trance, and then use a combination of 
this principle, which is associate one thing to the other. You can use the 
language. Because I’m touching you on the shoulder, you’ll relax more. 
That’s right, relax more, and so on. 
Use something physical so you can do a physical deepener – with the 
tapping, the touching and the rocking – or you can use the actual language 
or you can use both. Honestly, right now I don’t care. It’s up to you. You’re 
the hypnotist, right?
Who’s a hypnotist in this room?
I am.
That’s what we like to see. Any questions? Great! Well, off you go.

Rock n’ roll. Is he still a little unsteady on his feet? That’s good. Are you 
guys having fun?
Yes!
What do you notice happening as you’re doing these deepening 
processes? 
They go deeper.
They go deeper. Do you feel it as a subject? Do you feel yourself getting 
more relaxed?
Yes.
More comfortable? 
Yes.
So something’s working. All you have to do is create that expectation, 
create that association and it will happen. As long as you just go with it. 
Now some people might be a bit more problematic than others. That’s fine. 
Do you know why? If you’re a stage hypnotist, you don’t use those people. 
You have like the law of numbers in your favor. So you always work with 
the people you enjoy working with. That’s the beauty of this game. 
You’re not a hypnotherapist, which means you don’t have to work with that 
particular person. Actually, even as a hypnotherapist, you don’t have to do 
that. The point is you get to choose who you want to work with and who you 
don’t. If you don’t feel like it, just say, you know what, you have a beard. I 
don’t like beards. Off my stage, if you feel like it. 
Don’t do the whole beard thing you might offend them by it.

Fractionation Deepener
Here’s what we’re going to play with now. You’ve got the idea of deepening. 
Have you been noticing that as the days continue, they become easier and 
easier to drop into this trance and it’s more useful? 
What’s going on here is something called fractionation. Here’s what we’re 
talking about. Basically, hypnotists found that when you put someone in 
trance, they come back and they go to a certain depth. Then the next week, 
they’ll put someone in trance and they’ll go a little bit deeper. The next week 
they come back, and they’ll go a little bit deeper still and so on.
So each time their depth, their quality of experience becomes more intense. 
It’s kind of a learning process. Like most things you learn, you go, oh I know 
which way to go with this and you let go into it more and so on. 
So then they discovered that rather than have to do this in three different 
weeks, you could do this in three different days. In fact, you could do it in 
the same day. In fact, you can do it right after one another so that it’s in the 
same session. 
We’re going to put everything you’ve learned so far together to create this 
wonderful deep trance for people, and it’s going to be a lot of fun. Are you 
ready for this?
Yes!
I like a volunteer who wants to experience a wonderful deep trance. Come 
on up Scott, how can I say no to excitement like that?
Okay, look at me and sleep. All the way down, deeper. That’s right, 
deeper. And stand on your own balance. That’s right, very good. On 
your own balance but going deeper and deeper still. Okay, every 
time you touch on the shoulder here, deeper, deeper, deeper still. 
Okay, open your eyes, wide awake. 
And sleep. All the way down, deeper, deeper, deeper. Back on your 
own balance, your legs carry your weight perfectly. Deeper, deeper, 
deeper still, okay, open your eyes, wide awake. 
And sleep. All the way down, deeper, deeper, deeper.
Are you noticing a slight improvement of responses as we go along?
Students:
Igor:

60
And deeper still, that’s right, deeper still. Okay, wide awake. How are 
you doing? 
Okay.
Okay sleep, all the way down, deeper, deeper, deeper still. 
And now you can start using your skills if you want to start playing the role 
of a true hypnotist. 
From now on, every time you hear me say the word sleep, and I’m 
looking directly at you, just in the context of this training, when I look 
at you and say the word sleep, you’ll go to this state or even deeper. 
Always remembering – that’s right. Very good. Always remembering 
to maintain firm balance on your legs so you’re safe at all times. Nod 
your head if you understand. Very good.
So just to recap, every time I look directly at you and say the word 
sleep, you’ll go instantly into a deep a state as this or even deeper, 
only in the context of this training, so you can have wonderful deep 
trances. Nod your head if accept and understand that. Very good. 
Wide awake. How are you doing?
Okay.
You may as well, right? 
Sleep. That’s right. All the way, all the way, all the way that’s it. Very
good. 
One word, crazy power. No, you’re just setting it up. It’s just a natural 
part of the process. 
Okay and wide awake. How are you doing? Are you feeling great 
here?
Yeah.
Okay, this one’s going to be the real killer.
And sleep, all the way, all the way that’s right, deeper- deeper. Let 
your unconscious mind start taking this on board. Your ability to go 
into deep trances like this helps you become a great hypnotist. If you 
can do it, everyone you work with can do it. That’s right. 
The way you feel right now, every single one of your subjects in a 
stage show or in a demonstration, or actually just the hypnotherapy 
clients will feel this good and go this deep and respond this

powerfully. So you should feel really good about yourself doing that. 
That’s right. 
In a moment, I’ll touch your shoulder again on the side like this, and 
you’ll be wide awake feeling actually amazing, feeling better than 
you’ve felt in weeks, feeling so good, the thrill of energy going right 
through you. You’ll want to be doing this with people straightaway. 
You simply can’t wait. You will want me to stop taking just so you can 
go out there and grab someone and do this with them.
Nod your head if you understand what I mean. Very good, wide 
awake, all the way awake. There you go. 
Good stuff. Very good. Give him a round of applause. 
Applause
Is that difficult, folks? It’s just doing what you did over and over and over 
again. It’s like doing that little line-up you did before, only on the same 
person. That poor person is going to have such a good time. It’s unreal. Do 
you want me to say anything more about this, or are you pretty much ready 
to dive in and do it? Do you want to do it?
Yes.
Off you go. 
All right, folks. How do you feel? Can we have a little bit of space in the 
middle here? How are you feeling guys? 
Good.
Are you having fun?
Yes!
Do you want more?
Yes!
You better come back after lunch then because it’s that time of day already. 
So what I’m going to ask you guys to do is – we may as well leave the 
chairs here. Do you guys need chairs because we’re going to be doing lots 
of active stuff anyway? So if you want to sit down, just grab a chair and chill 
out for a little bit, but then come back up and we’ll do lots of work.

The key thing is who here right now feels relatively competent as a 
hypnotist? Not necessarily that you have it all down pat, but relatively 
competent. 
Now far be it for me to suggest that as you go into lunch, if someone 
catches your eye and you tell them, I’m a great hypnotist. I’m doing a show 
here in Vegas on Sunday. Come. Free tickets if you like. 
You’re allowed to invite whoever you want to the show on Sunday, by the 
way. You realize this, right? So if you meet people – the room is going to be 
the size of half of this room. There are going to be two different – we’ll talk 
about that later on, but essentially, you’re allowed to bring anyone you wish 
to. You don’t have to, but if you meet people, you may as well. 
We’ll talk more about the dynamics of how that show is going to work and 
stuff like that a little bit later on. Probably tomorrow morning. For the 
moment though, just go out there and just have fun. If you want to put each 
other in trance whilst having lunch, who’s to stop you? 
It’s a little different in here than out there, so you may as well get used to 
different venues. Now if you get a little bit carried away and someone looks 
at you and goes, oh my God, what the hell did you just do to him? You’ll say
come over here and I’ll show you.
Laughter
There’s nothing that says the hypnotic context is better then you zoning 
someone else to the floor. So you may as well hook up with a buddy. This 
will be a fun thing to do. Stone each other during lunch and as people are 
staring, just invite them over and just say do you want some? 
Laughter
Sound like good fun? All right, guys any last words from you or should be 
just send them to lunch?
No, I do have one last word. I just noticed this, and I should have noticed it 
earlier, but here it is. When you’re doing this with somebody else, if they’re 
chewing gum or if they’ve got something in their mouth, make sure that they 
spit it out because they can choke on it, and you don’t want that 
responsibility. 
So that’s the only thing that I noticed that I wanted to add. Even in this room 
or out of this room, if you want to mess with somebody, if they’re chewing 
gum or they’re sucking on candy, make sure that they take it out and 
terminate it. That’s it.
That’s a good bit of advice. Thank you.

Hypnotically Locked Arm
So how’s everyone doing?
Good.
Remember, we are here to kind of produce a little love vibe, so let’s try this 
again. How are you guys doing?
Great.
Now I like that. All right, go through the room, hypnotize three people and 
come on back. Go.
All right, guys. Are you having fun with that?
Yes.
All right, let’s just try that one again. Are you guys having fun with that?
Yes!
Whew. Now we’re feeling the love. All right, we’re going to start building the 
pace up a little bit. We’re going to do the same thing, three people, we’re 
going to be very fast and we’re going to look for speed. It’s not 
hypnotherapy. We’re not trying to build this crazy amazing experience for 
them. Just enough to be like a strong thing. You’re going to be in and out 
within 20 or 30 seconds. It’s a quick process. 
Speed is your friend, especially in a stage show. You don’t want to be 
boring people into a trance. That’s not much of a show. Choose the ones 
that are responding the best, and then do your show. That’s all you’re 
doing. You’re not here to hypnotize the whole world. That’s more like Street 
Hypnosis stuff, and we can come onto that later.
For the moment, we’re going to pick our subjects, go in quick, out quick and 
it’s done. Make sense? 
So what we’re going to do now is, again, what we did before but another 
level. So you’re going to go and find three people and zone them out 1-2-3. 
What I want you to do is then just fractionate them. So bring them in, bring 

65
the out. In, out, in, out three times- four times, just for the responses you’re 
getting.
Once that’s happened, they’ll then have a go at you and then you find the 
next person, three people. You should no need more than, say, three 
minutes for everyone to have their chance both ways, but I’m going to be 
generous and give you five, which means the pressure’s on in terms of 
timing. We want speed. Off you go.
Is that easy? It’s a no brainer, isn’t it? Can I have a volunteer please? 
Anyone? Okay, great. Come on up. Are you ready?
Yes, I am.
Okay, just sleep, all the way. Deeper, that’s right, deeper. That’s it. 
Good, deeper still, all the way, deeper, deeper. Then when I count to 
three, eyes open, wide awake. 1-2-3 how are you feeling?
Good.
Sleep, all the way, deeper, deeper and deeper. Okay, great. Each time 
you go, the deeper you’ll go. Every time we repeat this process, you’ll go 
deeper and deeper still. What I want you to do is listen to the word sleep, 
and you’ll instantly drop in a state as deep as this or even deeper. Nod 
your head if you understand. Very good. 
Okay, eyes open. And sleep, deeper, deeper, deeper still. Very good. 
Arm out. Stiff and rigid. Stiff and rigid. Stiff like an iron bar. Feel the 
energy flowing through it like an iron bar, like cement. Locking it tight, 
licking it tight. Try and bend it and you cannot. Try and bend it. Take this 
hand and try and bend it if you can. Try it. Hard. And sleep. Relax, all the 
way down, deeper, deeper, deeper. You’re doing great. 
Eyes open, wide awake. You did an awesome job. Well done. How do 
you feel?
I feel very relaxed.
You did an amazing job with this one because now you fell from the inside 
out. Give a nice round of applause.
Applause
Do you mind staying here for a second just for the mechanics? So we’re 
doing exactly what we just did a moment ago, right? Now is it so much of a 
stretch to just add something, like put your hand out there, make it strong, 
make it stiff? Is that a difficult suggestion to present?
No.

No? The words aren’t exactly going to be taxing on our brains, are they? All 
right, I want a little more enthusiasm, guys.
No!
No, I’m afraid. Don’t make me do this. Oh my God, please. All right,
remember, if nothing else the people you’re working with right now will be 
kind to you and they’ll pretend anyways. So whatever happens, you’ll be a 
success. Let’s face it we’re in a training room. So you cut your teeth on 
these sort of things, and then we’ll start introducing, shall we say, more and 
more wild scenarios so you can do it anyplace, anytime, anywhere. 
By the way, essentially what you just saw happening here, will work in 90% 
of the places you go to just like that. The minute you say, I’m a hypnotist let 
me show you something cool. That’s pretty much the standard response 
you will get not always but most of the time. Does that make sense?
At the moment we’re not really there yet, all we want is a couple of cycles of 
fractionation to actually control it and just say, put it up here. Make is 
strong, lock it tight. Whatever you want to say and then relax. It’s already 
happening, isn’t it? Do you feel that?
Yeah.
You’re going to use your language to stimulate the imagination, stimulate 
the unconscious mind to do things. So how can we stimulate it? What kind 
of things can we say?
Lock it. Isn’t that a word that just implies things? Make is strong. Feel it 
getting stronger. Like cement, like concrete, like an iron bar. Like a lug of 
wood. These are all metaphors, aren’t they, for things that don’t bend very 
well. Like your old primary school headmaster, you know, very stiff and 
rigid? 
Come on. You can do better than that. That was at least worth something. 
Laughter
Thank you. All right, but do you see where we’re going with this? It’s not for 
me to dictate to you that these are the words you must say it’s irrelevant. 
It’s the idea that you’re communicating to them, which is a stiffness or 
rigidity, of things that are stiff and rigid in our day-to-day experience. Does 
that make sense?

67
Any questions on that, or is that easy to do? It’s easy to do, right? So go 
around, again, three people at least. I want you to do the fractionation as 
quickly as possible because we’re going to look for the stiff arm as quickly 
as possible. Make sense? Thanks, James. Off you go.
Have you guys tranced each other out? I think they’re both out. They look 
like, who’s the hypnotist? I don’t know. Am I? Are you? What’s going on 
here? Good job. How do you guys feel? 
Great.
Wasn’t that easier than you thought?
Yes.
Okay, so here’s the thing. You guys are doing great because you’re already 
putting in your own – you notice how your own unconscious mind is actually 
providing the language for you? Each one of you sounds very different, 
right? That’s what you want to have happen. I don’t want to give you a 
script because then you’ll get stuck, like what the hell did he say again? Oh 
man, was it stiff and rigid or was it rigid and stiff? Oh Christ. Meanwhile, 
they’re all going, what the hell is this about?

Invent Your Own Induction
It doesn’t matter if you understand what you’re trying to do. So we’re going 
to have a little bit of fun with this now. What I want you to do now is I want 
you to invent, create out of nothing, an instant induction, fractionate them 
and put the hand out there and lock it up. Okay?
What do I mean by inventing? Basically, you can do anything you want. 
Remember, the cycle is you induce some kind of shock or interruption of a 
pattern of some sort. Then you just deepen when you say the word sleep 
somewhere in the beginning of that cycle. Make sense? So, pretty much 
anything can do.
Can I just borrow you a second, seeing as you’re there? 
Just look at me. Sleep, all the way. That’s it, good, deeper, deeper, 
deeper. 
Do you see a little bit of a shock going on there? Not too much. Do you hear 
the word sleep?
And deeper, that’s right.
Is that easy?
And wide awake, eyes open. Good job. Well done. Sleep! All the 
way, deeper, deeper, deeper. 
You can go on all day long like this. 
Wide awake, eyes open. Good job. This one is for real. 
Give him a round of applause.
Applause
Here’s the key. I don’t want you spending more than 10 seconds on the 
setup. So whatever it is you’re doing, whether you’re going to boink them on 
the head – please no knuckle sandwiches. That’s the wrong kind of sleep. 
Whether you’re going to boink them on the head, shake their shoulders or 
pull their arm, or if you’re going to kind of rock them back gently, whatever it 
is:
1. Make sure it’s safe. Your partner trusts you with their physical well-
being, so make sure its safe.

2. You spend no more than 10 seconds setting it up so that you’re 
going straight into the meat of it, which is the fractionation and a stiff 
arm at the end of it. 
Does that make sense to you, folks? Any questions on that? 
Yeah, when you’re pulling on someone, you don’t have to be really forceful 
or anything? But you just couldn’t be real gentle, right?
We do not want force. It looks like its forceful, but it’s not. The reason it 
looks forceful is because the person is – can I just borrow you because 
you’re a big chap. Now I want you to just like tense all your muscles up for a 
second. Just tense them up. Everything. Now if I shake here, do you see 
how it doesn’t look like much because he’s absorbing all the shock because 
there’s tension and he’s fighting it. 
Now just relax. This is what all this was about. Let’s just get him to relax. 
And sleep, all the way, deeper. Good, deeper. Maintaining your own 
balance now, go in deeper. Maintain your own balance. Deeper, 
that’s right. Your legs carry your balance deeper and deeper still. 
You did a great job, as a result, of which of course, this exercise is 
going to be so easy for you that it’s unreal. 
For the rest of you, well, you missed out, didn’t you? 
Eyes open, wide awake. Good job. Well done. 
Okay, give him a nice round of applause. 
Applause
So I am not looking for any kind of physical violence because that’s going to 
get you sued and in jail, and someone’s boyfriend who you probably don’t 
want to have that kind of intimate relationship with. 
What you want to do is take care of your partner. The, shall we say, drama 
of it comes from your voice – your voice can be strong and powerful – from 
them being relaxed. Does that make sense? If you start with their body 
being physically relaxed, its must more dramatic. So that may be one of the 
clues as to whatever you invent. 
I just want you to invent something. If you’ve seen something on a stage 
that you’ve always wanted to try out or know how to do, then do that. Do 
your own version of that. If you read something in a book and you go, that

would be kind of cool, then do that. If you just want to make something up 
off the top of your head, then do that instead.
What I want you to do is start using these basic principles and put them all 
together into a nice little simple routine, which ends up with an arm locked, 
stiff and rigid. Make sense? Are you ready for a little bit more, or is that 
enough for now.
More.
All right. So we’re going to do one more thing now. We’re going to now 
create a contrast, which is going to amplify the likelihood that you’re going 
to get that arm stiff. In other words, you’re going to give the unconscious 
mind motivation, more reasons for locking the arm out. Does that make 
sense?
So we’re going to use this same pattern – X 
Y – to link the arm 
getting stiffer, more rigid and not being able to bend to something positive 
to them. Let’s see, maybe making hypnosis easier? Being a great 
hypnotist? Just feeling great? Wouldn’t these be useful things?
So the stiffer their arm becomes, the better you feel. The better you feel the 
more powerful you become as a hypnotist. So make that arm so stiff that 
not even you can bend it so that you can actually trust your unconscious 
mind to make you the best hypnotist in the world. 
Now make it stiff and rigid. Feel better and better.
Do you see how we’re linking motivation for the unconscious mind in with 
the actual result that we want? You don’t have to do it, but it’s a very nice 
little thing to add leverage and, of course, just make it a fun piece for them 
too. Make sense? Any questions? Go and invent. Off you go. 
Are you having fun with this?
Yes.
It’s pretty easy, isn’t it? Isn’t it weird? Who’s seen this sort of stuff done 
before by others? Who’s kind of wanted to give it a go but were a little bit 
timid? Like, oh, I don’t know about this. Now that you know, isn’t it a lot 
easier. Its like, is that all there is to it? Well, the answer is yes, but you’ve 
got to bear in mind that you know things. You’re looking for things that most 
people aren’t, so your timing changes and that’s really the crucial part. 
Do you mind sharing the story you just told me about in terms of what 
happened at lunchtime? Is that okay? I think this is just fun. Can we have a 
microphone up here, please? I mean, this is just to bear in mind that this is

like lunchtime on the first day of training, and this is what happens quite 
regularly when people do this. Go ahead.
Linda and I decided we were going to go out and do this. So I changed my 
tag to say, Master Hypnotist. That way, I didn’t have to tell people what I 
was. They knew. 
We went to a place and Linda said to this guy who was a masseuse and he 
wasn’t doing anything, she said I’m a hypnotist and we’re taking this class, 
I can relax you and give you a couple hours’ sleep in about 10 minutes
would you like it? He goes, sure. 
She did the fractionation and did a couple of different things, and then after 
she was finished with him, he was like, wow, that’s incredible. Then I 
stepped in, and he was still pretty in much state. I did the same thing again 
to him. Fractionated him again a couple of times, told him he was going to 
be great, he was going to do the best, he was going to actually get a lot 
more customers and everything else.
Finished with him, dropped him out of it – took him out and went about my 
business. 
While we were doing it, there was another man sitting there saying, oh I 
can’t be hypnotized. I never could be hypnotized. It doesn’t matter what I try 
to do. 
I looked at him and I said you know you’re the best one because when you 
say that, I can put you in deeper and better and quicker, and it’s no big deal 
and I’ll show it to you.
So anyway, meanwhile, the masseuse who we told would do better and 
everything and he would go out and get more customers immediately got 
one. He stands there and starts working on her, looks at Linda and goes 
like this, thinking, yeah, I got it. I said to the girl, he’s the best there is. 
So long story short, this guy comes over to me who told me he had 
problems, and we put him in, put him in. I kept fractionating him. I kept 
doing whatever I was supposed to be doing. I kept doing it, kept doing it, in 
and out, in and out. Open eyes, close them. I pinched his arm and brought 
it up and showed his wife that he didn’t feel anything. Then I did it again. 
Then I told him he had insomnia and he couldn’t sleep. So I told him when 
you pinch your ear, you’ll go out and you’ll actually go to sleep. You’ll go 
deeper and you’ll feel better and better. I did it four times and the fifth time I 
did it, I just looked at him and said, okay, go ahead, just touch your thing. 
He touched it and he just fell over on me. His wife just looked at me. 
Student:

72
Then we got the invitation. You’re welcome to come to Puerto Rico. Here’s 
my card. 
Of course you are.
He said we will take you wherever you want to go. 
Applause
He said we’ll set up shows, we’ll do whatever we got to do for you, but you 
are my hypnotist, and you’re coming to Puerto Rico.
Do you see what happens, guys, now when you go out there and start 
using stuff.
He had a Rolex on. I’m not quite as good as that, but I’ll get there.
We’ll build up to that one, shall we?
Okay.
The reason I want to share that with you is because this is really what
happens when you start embracing hypnosis as a lifestyle. Use it as a force 
for good. I mean he wasn’t doing anything abusive to this person, making 
them embarrassed or anything like that. No. He’s giving them good stuff, 
good suggestions about sleep, about having the customers and being 
confident and so on, and look what happens?
This is what? Halfway through the first day? Isn’t that insane?
We had a crowd around us. 
Of course you did. It always happens. Here’s the thing to think about, guys, 
which is start doing it. How different was it out there than in here? Linda, 
how much have you done before in terms of hypnosis?
Zero.
First day, from nothing. You guys can do this. It’s just a question of going 
out there and doing it. Now I’m not going to push you. It’s up to you guys 
when and where and how because you’ll find your own time. 
When you do what we’ve been doing today there’s no difference between 
this and someone who’s being paid $2,000, $3,000 or $5,000 to stand up
here and do a show. No difference given what you already know. So pat 
yourself on the back, there you go.

How to Beat Shyness
So, we had a couple of people who were still nervous about the hypnosis 
skills. Who were they? Come forward. Are you still nervous? Come forward. 
Who else was nervous? Debra, come here. Where’s Debbie gone? Trying 
to hide from us Debbie? Come forward. Anyone else. Everyone else is like, 
no, I was going to be shy, but I’m starting to change my mind. You as well, 
excellent!
What I want you to do is you guys just stand – everyone make a line behind 
these guys, please. Debbie, come forward. Form a line behind Debra, 
Karen and, is it Matt? Just form a line behind them, folks. Just roughly 
equal. Debbie, just separate yourself because you have separate lines. You 
have one line and he has one line. Don’t get greedy now. Don’t steal his 
line.
Here’s what I want you to do. You folks in the front just turn around and 
face the people behind you. You’re going to put them in a trance in 10 
seconds, and as soon as you’re done, send them off, go to the back and 
you’ll do the next person, all the way through. Go! Quickly, guys.
Do it again. Keep going. You’re doing great. The main reason for doing that 
is just to show you guys that competence builds confidence. How much 
more confident do you feel just after a few minutes of doing that? It’s just 
repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition. It will drill in. So the 
more you do it, the easier it becomes.
If any of you take a break after while, let’s say you don’t do it for a couple of 
months I get nerves as well, because I haven’t done it for a while. But once 
you start, it’s like riding a bike. It’s there, so just repeat, repeat, repeat.
What I recommend you do is you treat this as a boot camp. When you are 
done here at 9:00 tonight, rather than crashing out in bed, grab someone 
and do another hour out there somewhere, preferably not in the Venetian. 
Go to another hotel and destroy them. 
Why? I’ll tell you why. Because the minute you start doing it, even with 
yourselves, you will start drawing a crowd just like, I think it was Jim who 
said it a moment ago, you’ll draw a crowd. As the crowd gets drawn in, 
you’ll some people going like this. You’ll go up to them and go, come over 
here, and you’re in it. It’s easy to do, but you need to practice and that’s the 
one thing, I can’t do for you. Are you guys having fun with this?
Yes!

Hypnotic Tests & Demos
Okay. So let’s start getting into some suggestion demonstrations. These will 
be useful when it comes to do doing a stage show for selecting volunteers, 
also useful in Street Hypnosis to show some of the power of hypnosis. This, 
of course, was one of them, wasn’t it? 
So let’s play with a classic one. 
Everyone just go ahead and stick your hands out in front of you. Clap 
your hands together. Interlock the fingers. Turn the hand up so the 
knuckles are facing the ceiling, and now open your fingers up. 
Squeeze those hands. Open those fingers.
Now in a moment those fingers are going to start coming together. 
Feel those fingers come together, like a magnet. Imagine the magnet 
coming together. When those fingers touch, just close your eyes and 
go into a trance, closer and closer. Feel those fingers coming like a 
magnet, a force, pushing, locking, tighter and tighter. 
When those fingers touch, just close your eyes. When those fingers 
touch, and then close your eyes. When those fingers touch, just 
close your eyes. 
You guys rock. Look at you guys go. 
And because your eyes are closed right now, deep and relaxing in 
this comfortable state, it means that you can do this experiment so 
easily with people. It takes seconds to do, and you’ll instantly see 
who the quick responders are, who the good responders are and 
who you’re going to work them for a little while before you actually 
start doing anything crazy or dynamic with them.
For now, just allow your hand to rest, return to your sides. You’re 
eyes will only open as quickly as you can internalize how simple that 
was.
And it is simple, isn’t it? 
Yes.
So here’s what I want you to do. Just one-on-one for now, and we’ll start 
building into group stuff in a minute. It’s just three basic steps.
1. You’re getting the hands out. Remember the compliance stuff. You 
can make the shuffling steps if you want. That’s all good.
Students:
Igor:

75
2. Hands out, hands together, lock hands, press hands. The pressing of 
hands is important because if they’re hands are like this, this won’t 
work so well. You want their hands pressing together.
3. Quickly tell them what’s going to happen. Fingers are going to start 
coming together. Closer and closer like magnets drawing them. 
Why? Because for most people, they’re not going to last out here for 
very long. 
You’re just going to use the same stuff, associate responses or reactions to 
what’s going on. Does that make sense to everyone? Is that easy to do? I 
want you to spend no more than maximum a minute, but it really should be 
about 30 seconds just running people through this. 
Again, do one they do you and go find someone else. Just keep doing it 
over and over again, until its second nature. Easy. Off you go. 
Was that easy? 
Yes.
Now one of these suggestibility tests you’re doing here or, I prefer them as 
suggestion demonstrations, because they’re just showing the power of 
hypnosis through demonstrations. This one is pretty loaded in your favor. 
Why? Physiologically if you’re squeezing your hands together, those fingers 
will want to come together anyway. So it’s kind of loaded.
It’s useful as a warm-up routine for people, but when you want to select a 
good volunteer for a stage show, you want to make it increasingly more 
difficult for people to “succeed” with these demos. Why? Any ideas? 
You don’t want everyone.
Yeah. You don’t want everyone on stage. There’s like the whole audience 
on stage and there’s like one little grandma knitting in the background 
going, that’s nice dear. 
Laughter
That’s not the kind of show you’re necessarily, going to want, so you get to 
choose who you want to have. A lot of these pieces you’ll do just for the fun 
or just to warm yourselves up, because you’ll feel more confident. But, in 
time you’ll start doing more and more risky pieces precisely because you 
want to be able to filter through who’s really responding powerfully, who’s 
being okay and who’d give the knitting needle to and say, just go ahead and 
make some socks.

What we’re going to do now is we’re going to go through a whole bunch of 
different suggestion demos like these that you can start playing with, and 
we’ll start building into a group environment so you can actually start feeling 
like you’re on stage. Won’t that be something? 
Let’s start with everyone, hands out. Say, yes master. Only kidding. 
Laughter
See, I got them now. Oh yeah. 
Hands out. I want you to imagine two magnets, two powerful 
magnets in either palm. As you imagine, look at the space between 
those palms and feel those hands coming together. They want to 
come together, and they will come together. They’re beginning to 
move now, coming closer and closer together. Imagine it, feel it, let it 
happen.
When those hands touch, close your eyes go deep in trance and 
discover so many things about hypnosis, being fully balanced. That’s 
right. Staying full balanced in hypnosis as you discover the power of 
your own mind. That’s right. Imagine those magnets. Feel them. 
There you go. Now it’s happening, coming closer and closer. Feeling 
them closer and closer, drawing in closer and closer. 
When those fingers touch, your eyes will close, your hands will drop 
and you can go into a deep comfortable trance, totally in balance. 
Totally balanced by your own legs, that’s right. Deeper and deeper, 
that’s right. Those of you with your eyes closed right now, these 
suggestions will go 10 times deeper. Those of you with your eyes 
wide open you get to enjoy this for a totally different level. 
As you stand there listening to me right now, your ability to be a 
great stage hypnotist is going through the roof. I’d like you to 
visualize it right now. Imagine it. Think about you on the stage, how 
good it feels and the thunder of applause. People coming up to you 
afterwards shaking your hand, thinking what an amazing show that 
was. See it, feel it and enjoy it now.
When you’re ready, open your eyes and bring yourself back and that 
good feeling can continue in the back of your mind all the way 
through the rest of this training and probably the rest of your life. 
Woo.
Applause
So that one has no physical help involved. That’s purely based on 
suggestion. You can do that with people?

It’s no different from the stiff arm or this one really, is it? Okay, find a couple 
of people. Do it. Off you go. 
Woo. You guys are getting way ahead of the game. All I wanted was people 
just to put their hands together and that’s it. It’s not rocket science, right? 
We’re Master Hypnotists.
Well, I know. You’re way ahead of the game! So far, so good, right. Give 
me a little bit of space so we can just see your wonderful expression. There 
you go.
The question that I have is, for somebody they can look at the arms and 
then close real quickly, where others for me, it’s much better when I have 
my eyes closed. But when you are making the pick, would you want to pick 
someone that can do it with eyes open?
I don’t care. All that matter’s is are they responding? The point is what are 
they responding to? If your suggestion is, look between the spaces when 
those hands come together, you’re only sorting for the people who respond 
the quickest to your suggestions, whatever they are. 
So, we’re looking for the things you paid attention to this morning. Their 
focus, how concentrated are they? How distracted do they get? Are they 
beginning to sway a little bit? You sometimes see people literally doing this.
Do you think they’re ready to go? It’s not rocket science. It’s actually not 
that difficult to spot the good subjects. Basically, whatever you choose, for 
the stage version anyway, you only choose those subjects that respond the 
quickest, most dramatically and so on, and you discard the rest. Not 
because you can’t make anything of the rest, but just because you don’t 
have to. Does that make sense to you guys?
What about you see some shows where they just simply ask for volunteers?
Oh, we’ll come onto that. When it comes to the structure itself, you can do it 
either way. You can just ask for volunteers, but you still have to test them 
either way. 
Up on stage?
Up on stage, yes. Just so you know. Just so you know who to choose. 
And then you get the hard ones.

78
Igor:
Students:
Yeah, pretty much. Then you get the hard ones and you just kind of get rid 
of them along the way, just because that’s how the show goes. That’s how 
the show works. Don’t worry. We’re getting there. For now, are you having 
fun with this? Is this is easy? 
Yes!

79
The Performance Mind
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
All right, let’s throw some more classic things in, but before we start 
throwing in some more of the classic suggestion demos, what I want to start 
doing with you guys is actually preparing you mentally for an actual 
performance. 
There is a state of mind that will make you a great performer. Actually, 
makes sure that you can spot everything that’s going on and be in control of 
the stage to have a good time with everyone and so on would you like to 
learn how to do that?
Yes!
Seeing as we’ll be doing this standing up anyway, you may as well stay 
standing. 
I’d like you to pick a spot on the wall up here somewhere. Perhaps 
someplace where the light shimmers, something above eye level, focus 
on it intensely. So intensely, in fact, that your eyes begin to water a little 
bit perhaps because of strain or something like that. 
The moment you begin to feel your eyes strain, I want you to relax your 
eyes. Don’t close them. Keep them open, but relax them and you’ll notice 
your vision beginning to expand. You’ll begin to see the sides and the 
edge of the room, the gold of the wall, the blue of the floor, maybe in the 
lights and the ceiling. 
Let that vision continue to expand until it has a sense of wrapping all 
around you and you know you’ve got it when your breathing shifts. When 
your breathing shifts and is deeper and calmer, just raise your hand.
Meanwhile, allow your sense of expanding vision to continue. Once you 
have that, allow your eyes to come down only as slowly as you can look 
around the room maintaining that state. Your breathing doesn’t change. 
Your eyes still see the whole of the room, but you get to look around the 
room slowly enough that you can still see the whole of the room. Go 
ahead and try that out.
It should feel a little quieter inside your mind. This is your performance 
state. As you look around and you make sure you can see the whole 
room at the same time – the edges of the wall, the floor, the ceiling –
you’ve switched on your parasympathetic nervous system, the relaxation 
response. 

80
When you are relaxed, it’s easier to see everything that’s going on around 
you. When you’re relaxed as a performer, your best performances come 
out. 
So why not relax and take that into your performance so you can see 
everything that your subjects and volunteers are doing, whilst at the same 
time just feeling that good feeling inside? And you do, don’t you? Feel a 
good feeling? 
Did you enjoy that? So from now on, I’m going to ask you that every time 
you start an exercise, you start by getting that peripheral vision, and then 
you’re just talk them through the exercise and so on. 
Does that make sense?
You’re going to train it into your neurology so when you stand up on stage 
and you go, oh, you’ll just go, ah welcome to my show! Does that make 
sense?

81
More Hypnotic Demos
All right, folks. 
Maintaining that state, I want you to all put your hand out in front of you 
like so. Take one hand. The right hand – the one that most people write 
with – if your left-handed, it’s the other one, and turn it over so it’s facing 
up. With the right hand facing up, I want you to imagine that the right 
hand has a heavy bucket of sand in it, a heavy bucket of sand. 
The left wrist has a bunch of balloons tied to it, a bunch of balloons lifting 
up towards the sky, a heavy bucket of sand and a light set of balloons 
lifting up on the other wrist. 
Now I want you to pour water into that sand bucket so it gets heavier and 
heavier and heavier still. Yet that wrist becomes lighter and lighter. More 
balloons get out of it. Perhaps a swarm of butterflies comes tinkling in 
between those balloons, lifting it higher and higher and higher still.
Meanwhile, your right hand is getting heavier and heavier, dropping down 
lower and lower and lower still. Your left arm lifting higher and higher, 
that’s right. 
When you’re ready, just look around and notice the variation in response. 
Pretty cool, huh? Now bring yourself out of trance, shake your hands out 
and you are ready to rock n’ roll.
Is that easy? Again, we’re looking for a sequence of steps, just purely and 
simply so that we’re getting compliance as we go along. Then just imagine 
something heavy, something light, and create that contrast between the 
hands. It’s easy, isn’t it?
It’s so easy in fact you may as well play with your eyes to make that 
distinction. In other words, that performance state, to lock into more as 
you’re doing it. Off you go.
Is this easy or what?
Yes.
It’s easy stuff. All right, so are you having fun so far? 
Yes!

Ooh, that’s so close, on the line. 
Everyone put your hand out in front of you, please. Clap your hands 
together and interlock your fingers. I want you to start squeezing those 
fists together, those hands together. Squeeze them tight. Look at the top 
of your knuckles. 
Do not look at me. Look at the top of your thumbs and do not look away. 
Focus all of your attention. Squeeze those hands, tighter and tighter. Let 
them become tighter and tighter still, tighter and tighter still.
The harder you squeeze, the more they lock. They more they lock, the 
better you feel. The better you feel the tighter they become. Lock them 
tight. Lock them down so hard that they will not open. They will not open. 
No matter how hard you try, they are stuck. Locked tight. Locked tight. 
Go ahead and try. Try to open those hands, and they’re locked tight. The 
harder you try, the tighter they lock, and the better you feel. That’s right. 
Very good. And sleep. All the way down. Deeper, deeper, deeper, 
deeper, deeper still, that’s right. 
In a moment you’re going to open your eyes, wide awake. This time, 
however, you’ll find that this hand is just stuck to your head. 1-2-3 wide 
awake, stuck tight. Stuck tight. Try to remove your hand. What’s going 
on? 
It’s not moving.
It’s not moving. 
No.
Is that usual?
No.
Does that happen often? But you are awake, right?
Yeah. 
But that hand’s stuck? How does that work?
I don’t know.
You know what? Let’s try this. If you put this one here, perhaps this one will 
release. This one must be stuck instead now, right? Because one has to 
take the place of the other, right? What’s going on?

Now here’s a crazy thing. 
In a moment, you find that hand will start to lift, but only as quickly as 
you find it so hysterical that it happened that you’ll laugh and laugh and 
laugh. Go ahead and try it. 
There you go. As that hand begins to remove from your head, you’ll 
laugh harder and harder. By the time that hand has actually unstuck 
itself, you are laughing hysterically. That’s right. 
And sleep. All the way down, deeper, deeper. That’s right, deeper still.
Another suggestion has faded from your mind, knowing that you’ve done 
a great and amazing job. That’s right, an amazingly great job. You can 
have that good revitalizing feeling knowing that your unconscious mind 
did this, and you can do this with anyone. Feel that motivation. Feel that 
sense of achievement that you can do this too. 
Okay, 1-2-3 wide awake. Everyone, if your fingers are still locked just 
release those hands and feel good.
How are you doing?
I’m doing well.
Give her a nice round of applause.
Applause
You can do all this stuff. We’ll be coming onto this sort of stuff in the next 
segment. I just want to start giving you a little bit of a taste of where you’re 
going with this. It’s nothing different from what you’ve done already. 
Are you looking forward to this sort of thing?
Yes.
Go ahead.
Was there a particular reason why you chose her?

84
Igor:
Student:
Igor:
Students:
She was one of the fastest responders.
And you noticed that from the whites of her hands or whites of her 
knuckles?
Yeah, it was partly from the other exercises we did before. We stacked 
some of these just to watch different responses and, let’s put it this way, 
you’ve been in and out of trance all day long, so I could probably do it with 
most of you in the room, pretty much off the bat at this point. 
Earlier on, I noticed that she was responding much more quickly than the 
rest of you guys. Plus there’s the whole trance locking thing and so on. But 
in terms of what you recognize and what you look for, we’ll come onto that. 
Experience will be your guide. Here’s the crazy thing, guys. Once you get 
onto this, which will be in the next segment. You don’t necessarily have to 
do it now, but if you want to do it, then feel free. Can we just have you step 
aside a little bit? There you go. Can we have a microphone over here as 
well, please?
Once you start doing this, believe it or not, what you want to have happen is 
you want this to actually fail. Let me say this again. In this room right here, 
what you want to have happen when we start getting into more of the 
waking suggestion things, you want it to actually fail from time to time. Do 
you have any idea why?
A couple of things, it’s so you can tell the difference between who’s ready 
and who’s not. If everyone’s ready all the time, how are you going to know? 
Well, you don’t even have to think about that anymore. 
Then you start developing that sense of what was different about this 
person versus that person? You will have success in this room, guaranteed. 
It’s a no brainer. About at least half the people in this room will respond
quickly. I’d say about eight to 10 people in this room; you’ll be able to do 
that stuff just off the bat.
With some, it might not quite work out the same way. I mean some things 
you’ll have better results with than others. You want to watch what happens
so you begin to build experience. Does that make sense?
Then it’s also a fact that if it doesn’t work out, do you know what? No big 
deal. Do you know why? Do you want to have a default that gets you out of 
jail for any problem you get into? No matter how much you do this and it 
fails and you go, oh my God, I’m a bad hypnotist, do you want a get out of 
jail free card?
Yes.

85
Igor:
Student:
Igor:
Student:
Igor:
Yes? May I borrow you for this? It’s just failed, so what you do is you say; l
Look at me, and sleep, deeper, deeper, deeper. Now forget about all 
that. Just fade it from your mind. That’s right. Let it all go, as you just 
feel fantastic. In a moment, I’ll count from 1-3, and you’ll open your 
eyes feeling fantastic, having had a great time here. 1-2-3, open your 
eyes and having a great time.
How are you doing?
Fine.
Did you enjoy that?
Yes.
Fantastic. Off you go. That’s it. You’re done. As far as everyone else is 
concerned, it’s like, oh my God, the hypnotist just put him in trance and he 
did stuff. You cannot fail if you’re doing this especially on the streets. On the 
stage, honestly, if it doesn’t work out do you know what you do? You say, 
thank you very much and good-bye. So either way you win. Does that make 
sense to you guys? 

86
Twin Minute Demos 
So here’s what I want you guys to do now. I want you to pick groups of four 
people. All right, you’re going to get in a group of four people. In that group 
of four people, we’re going to have one being the stage hypnotist and three 
people being the “audience.” Your audience – it doesn’t matter who it is, 
guys. Just choose any random people. 
The one who is the hypnotist will start by getting yourself in that state. Look 
at your audience, and you have two minutes, only two minutes to do two 
different suggestion demonstrations. Two different hypnotic or waking 
hypnotic demonstrations this one, that one and this one, I don’t care which 
one it is. Two minutes to do both of them. 
At the end of that, you’ll rotate and the next person does their two minutes 
and so on. So the whole thing will take eight minutes tops.  
Are you ready for this? I’m going to ask you guys to keep time. In other 
words, have one person be the official time-keeper in the group because we 
do not want to waste time on the peripherals. We want to get into the show 
and so on. So if you can do it fast, then you can start doing it slower and 
really building it up if you need to. Does that make sense? Any questions? 
Are you ready to do it?
Yes.
All right, come on you guys. Are you ready to do this?
Yes!
Off you go–
How was that?
Cool. 
Who is starting to feel like a reach Vegas-style hypnotist? All right. It’s kind 
of getting there, isn’t it? You guys are awesome. I mean we packed a lot 
into this day, and we haven’t even come close to finishing yet. So I hope 
you guys are feeling really proud of what you’re doing because it is actually 
really, really solid stuff.

We’re learning all the mechanics today for the actual stage show, which 
we’ll be focusing on tomorrow. Can we have a microphone over here, 
please?
The key thing right now for you to start focusing on is the variety of 
responses. Can you see different people reacting slightly differently? Some 
a little bit more strongly, some a little bit more mildly, shall we say. By now, 
most people will be a little bit more at the strong of the end of the scale, but 
even so, you still have a bit of a range of responses. 
I just want you to start noticing these things because it’s going to be an 
important thing for you to look out for up here on the stage as a hypnotist 
doing your work, selecting the right people for your show.  .
Yeah, one thing I found is when the hypnotist was doing the thing, that has 
a very strong suggestive effect, that just saying it, like you just did. 
Yes. So just to emphasize, you, the hypnotist, are presenting the 
suggestion at every level. If you say, stick your hands out or stick your 
hands out, it’s a big difference, right? Imagine one hand so heavy. It feels 
heavier and heavier. The other hand is so light. 
Do you see what’s going on, of course, is you’re telling their unconscious 
mind how to respond? If I’m doing, so heavy, and so light, I’m telling them 
to do little things. I’m say, so heavy, so light. I’m already telling them how to 
respond. Does that make sense? So it’s a great thing.
These are the tricks you’ll be picking up and be doing more and more of as 
we continue through, especially the three days of the boot camp. 
Any other questions or comments? What have you guys been learning so 
far? I want a little feedback from you at this point.

Hypnotic Intent H+
Student:
Igor:
Student:
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
For me, a little bit – mostly is your H+ thing. Just believe it and it will happen 
pretty much. 
For example, you can believe that you’ll have to answer that phone call the 
next time that happens, right?
I believe I’ll turn it off.
So for those of you who are not familiar with the concept of H+, it’s 
basically, this intense as I hypnotize and intense desire for the experience 
to be positive. At that point, you’re creating this wonderful little vibe that 
people want to respond to by going into trance and whatever the 
experience is that you’re offering them. 
This is something called hypnotic intent in some schools. Some people 
don’t even teach it. The idea is people respond to you at all levels. If I’m 
going to be like, okay go into trance now, there might be something slightly 
wrong with the context it’s happening in.
Would you be feeling safe in someone’s hands that’s going okay- okay, 
okay, now go into a trance? It may not create the healthiest environment 
where people want to create trust and that sort of stuff. So you need to 
create that environment, and you do that by going there first.
Are you having a good time here, guys? Honestly? 
Yes.
If you will remember how good this feels the next time you try to hypnotize 
someone, you feel that and you go, you’re going to have the same 
experience I did. That’s it. That’s all it takes. You all had it. You all come 
from different walks of life, different countries and different professions. If 
you can do it, everyone else can do it too. 
Whether they do it right in front of you is really just a question of when and 
where. Most people you meet, bam! Just like that. It’s your attitude that tells 
them this will work. So that’s a key piece. Really, all we’ve been doing this 
morning, the mechanics are pretty straightforward. 
Really, the main thing we’ve been focusing on throughout the day today is 
building up your enthusiasm so that H+, that hypnotic intent, shines out and 
people go, yep, that’s exactly what I want to do. My hand is stuck and I 
guess that’s what’s going to happen. Go ahead.

89
Student:
Igor:
Student:
Igor:
So we are looking for those people who respond the quickest. Is that a 
percentage?
Yes. 
We can tell what percentage of the audience, when we are doing a show, 
that will be the quick responders?
Absolutely. Quick is one of the tests you’re looking for. You’re looking for 
quickness and completeness, shall we say. So some people are quick and 
go, yeah, that’s good. Others are like, oh my God, this is so cool. They’ll be 
very dramatic for your performance, but we’ll get into that tomorrow.
In terms of percentages, the numbers stated in terms of a stage show is 
one in five people will be a great subject for a show. So, basically, if you 
have an audience of five people, you’ll know you’ll be able to do a show. It’s 
true.
In public, it’s even better if you’re talking about Street Hypnosis and stuff 
like that. We’ll be talking a little bit about that later on today. It’s even easier 
because the ones that are interested will come in and go, wow, what’s that? 
Sleep. 
So the context actually makes Street Hypnosis easier if you get the context 
right. So yeah, you’re looking for one in five. What we were doing, by the 
way, just so you guys are aware, on the Sunday when you do your actual 
shows, you’re going to be doing shows in front of an audience of 30, 40 or 
maybe 50 people, depending if you’re inviting people to come down to it or 
not. It’s up to you. It doesn’t matter.
Now most stage hypnotists will be afraid of doing that. I want to tell you this 
right now. Don’t be afraid. It’s like, oh my God, I don’t know if I can do that 
in front of an audience because they’re looking for the odds. You guys will 
be so well ahead of the game that it will be so easy for you. When you guys 
come it’s like it’s no big deal. Whoever wants to come up, just come up? I’ll 
work with anyone.
So my ambition is to get you to the point at the end of these four days 
together where you’re doing stuff which most other stage hypnotists would 
be afraid to do, but for you it’s a no brainer. I mean think about it. Just think 
about what you just did there. How large was your audience just now? 
Three or four people. No more than that. So you’re already working against 
the odds, and it’s still working. What the hell’s going on there?
Let’s call a break here. It’s now – what time is it? Oh, we have a question 
over here first.

90
Student:
Igor:
Just a comment that while I was being hypnotized and the person had their 
hand on my shoulder, I actually felt a vibration. He was actually nervous 
and it generated through my entire body.
Right. So this is just part of getting used to it. As people get more used to it, 
that starts subsiding and you’ll be confident and relaxed. That’s just 
practiced repetition, basically, its good stuff.

The Hypnosis Lifestyle
Hey, what’s up, guys? 
What’s up?
All right, we’re going to have a good time. Now we’re going to get a little bit 
dirty, how’s that?
Yeah. Let’s do it.
All right. I have to keep it PG, so we’re not going to get too dirty, PG13. I’ve 
got to tell you a story about that real quick and then I’ll go on.
I did a lot of shows in Salt Lake. I produced a show there years ago, where I 
did it for 6 ½ years straight every Saturday night. At the time, it was the 
longest running comedy hypnosis show ever developed, Salt Lake City of 
all places.
We had about 500 people a week that came to my show. So over the 
course of time, I had the opportunity to hypnotize over 100,000 just right 
there at the show, not counting all the corporate gigs that I got out of that. 
Anyway, talking about this PG stuff, Salt Lake City was like that. 
I started working in a lot of nightclubs, doing a lot of nightclub acts. They 
approached me and said why don’t you come and do a show in a theater. I 
said no, I like to party I like to have a good time. You can go to nightclubs 
and people treat you right. Do you know what I’m saying? So, it’s a whole 
different thing. 
But then I thought about it, because they chased me for about three 
months, really wanting me to do it. So one day I sat back and I said to 
myself, I said self, it’s just an act. We’re just actors, so why limit yourself to 
what you can learn and what you can do. 
So I said okay, maybe I can’t say some of the things I normally say. Maybe 
I can’t do some of the things I normally do, but how can I stretch myself as 
a human being and become something different so more people can have 
an opportunity to help me make more money.  
I had to stretch and I did. I stretched. I went to this theater and said okay, I’ll 
do it, and it was PG. My show my PGG. Well, it was G+, PG17, yeah 

92
because there were a lot of innuendos, so a lot of what you can do in your 
shows is a lot of innuendos.
What I want to know right now – and I’m sorry that I was late. I just got a 
call from Canada, they wanted me to come up there and do a show for 
$5,000. So I’m sorry that I missed out on part of this earlier, the stuff you 
guys were doing. I say this to you because I want you to know what 
happens. 
All you have to do is walk away and when somebody calls and says we 
want you to come to Canada, we want to give you $5,000 and of course, 
we’ll pay your expenses and everything else on top of that. That’s even 
before you get there and then, of course, when you get there you make 
more money right, because you have other things that you sell while you’re 
there.
Then people want to see you for private hypnosis sessions, so you charge 
them $500 for an hour. It’s not too bad really. So you are learning 
something here that’s very cool and I think what you’ve been doing in the 
last segment was a lot of hypnotic tests is that correct?
Yes.
Somebody show me what you did. What did you learn?
We did suggestibility tests, practiced, the fractionation tests and practiced a 
lot. We put someone in trance, bring them back and then put them back into 
trance and the suggestibility, we did three or four kinds. 
All right, so we’re on track then. This is good. Do you feel pretty good about 
what you’ve learned so far?
Yes.
Do you feel like you’re professional hypnotists at this point?
Yes!
All right, I see a few eyes going, working on it almost there. Give us a 
couple more days. I’m going to tweak your minds a little bit more.

Conversion Inductions
Okay, this is very cool. With your tests, how do you convert a hypnotic test 
into a full blown hypnotic induction, I mean just drop somebody in a trance? 
Should be have some fun and show you how this is done?
Yes.
I’m going to show you how we do this, we’re going to take that from there 
and then we’re going to break up in to groups like we did earlier so you 
have the opportunity to do the exact same thing, but do it very carefully. I’m 
not very gentle, but I’ll try to be.
I need a volunteer up here.
I’ll volunteer.
Who’s that?
Me.
Did I have you up here before?
No.
Are you sure?
I was up there, but you didn’t put me into trance.
All right. Come on, Bill, right?
Yeah Bill.
Okay, give him some applause.

This is kind of like between demonstrational-type hypnosis – doing street 
hypnosis on the street – and you can also use it when doing a hypnosis 
show. We’re going to go more into the structure of doing a complete show 
later on tonight and tomorrow. 
Here’s a demonstration and I think for this one, you can do this. Let’s just 
do this.

Put your hands in front of you.  
Should I take my glasses off?
Oh you can keep them on. I don’t care. 
I don’t either.
I’m fine because I’m not going to smash your eyes or your face or your 
nose. 
Put your hands out there in front of you. Lock your hands together. 
Squeeze your hands together as tightly as you can. I want you to 
start your thumbs right there. Put them just like that. I want you to 
squeeze your hands together as tightly as you can. Squeeze them 
together, and make sure that your arms are locked and they are 
glued. 
Do you see what I’m doing? I want to make sure that his hands are tight 
and his arms are locked. They are glued and they will not come apart, so I 
want to make sure that they’re tight. I’m not going to fail I want to make sure 
that the person I’m working with has it all together. The person will not fail. I 
will not fail. If they’re not obeying what I’m saying, I’m going to keep working 
with them until they do. 
So, when you as a hypnotist go out and begin working with people, there’s 
no place to slide, just keep moving through it and don’t worry about it.
Make sure those hands are stuck tight, stuck tight, tight, tight, tight. 
Make sure your hands will not come apart. They’re stuck tight. Are 
you sure they’re stuck there, Bill? Are you sure? Sleep.
Okay, so you can see in this instance how you can take a simple test like 
that and you can turn that into an induction of any kind. Do you see how 
that works? It’s the same principle that we were talking about earlier.
Wide awake. Are you okay? Close your eyes. I’m going to count to 
three. Close your eyes. I’m going to count to three, open your eyes. 
This time you’re going to be – close your eyes. 
Do you see how sometimes you’ve got to take these people and tell them 
what to do?
I’m going to count to three. At number three, this time your eyes are 
going to be wide awake and you’ll be full of energy. Get ready. Here 
we go 1-2-3 wide awake. Good. How do you feel?
Great.

Okay. Now, you can shock a person into trance and you can shock them 
out. Did you see what I did? This is a backwards induction. That’s all it is, 
it’s like giving a person a triple espresso in the brain. It’s the same thing. 
The mind is going, what am I supposed to do? Sleep! Wake up!  
Do you see how we took that and converted that into a simple induction? 
Hang on here, Bill. Are you awake, we have a question?
Yeah. 
I’ve heard that when you bring somebody out extremely rapidly that it can 
cause headaches. Is that just a rumor or is it something we should be 
worried about?
I think it’s a nasty rumor. 
Really, okay. 
I mean on the serious side of it, when you’re working with anybody in 
hypnosis, anything can happen and that’s the truth. I mean, could it give 
somebody a headache? Possibly. Have I ever done it? No. Have I heard 
about it? Yeah, but normally that would happen if somebody is not using 
hypnosis properly. 
When you learn how to do hypnosis properly, you’re not going to have 
those problems. Now, let’s say that he did. For example, let’s say that I said 
wide awake and he goes oh, I’ve got a headache. What are you going to 
do? 
Put him back in?
Maybe, I don’t know. You can simply say that, but my thing would be –
because listen, I’m a concerned, compassionate human being. First, you 
must care about your subjects at all times. Be a decent human being. So 
first, I’m going to say Bill, you’ve got a headache, okay? Can you give me a 
headache? Okay cool.
You’ve got a neck ache? Far out okay, good. Have you ever had neck 
problems before? 
No. 
No. Just since I yanked you? Okay, cool. So there are no other reasons 
why you would have a headache or a neck ache, right?
No. 

96
Spencer:
Bill:
Spencer:
Bill:
Spencer:
Okay, good.
Whiplash.
Whiplash. Okay, so you’ve got whiplash because of me. Okay, cool. He 
doesn’t really have whiplash. We’re role-playing here, but do you see what 
I’m saying? I want to ask because first, if there’s a medical condition that’s 
underlying what’s going on with the person, I want to know if there’s a 
medical condition going on. 
Barring that, typically if somebody has a headache or something like that, it 
could just be because oh wow, the re-orientation was so rapid that the 
blood just went to their head very quickly. So I might just say 
Just take a deep breath. Just close your eyes. Just relax for just a 
second. Close your eyes and just relax. Good. Here you go. In a 
moment, I’m going to count to three and on number three, open your 
eyes feeling nice and relaxed. Your head is calm and clear. 
Everything feels fantastic in every way. Here we go. 1-2, nice and 
easy now and then 3, open your eyes. Your head is nice and clear. 
How do you feel now?
Great.
Okay, good. That’s a real simple way to do that. If they still have a 
headache when you do, I would do the same thing again. If they still have 
one, we’re going to talk about that Saturday when I talk more about how to 
do hypnotherapy, because there may be a time when you’re a stage 
hypnotist that you need to apply your skills as a hypnotherapist. 
Does everybody here have hypnotherapy skills?
Who here does not have training in hypnotherapy? Raise your hands. 
Some of you do not. Lots of material back there that’s going to teach you 
good stuff. Igor has some classes coming up and I’ve got training, so there 
are all sorts of things where you can learn. Get yourself competent in it to 
feel really good about it. 
That said; I’m going to teach you some cool mini-hypnotherapy techniques 
that you can utilize when you’re working with somebody if that ever 
happens in a stage show.
Are there any questions on the conversion there? What I want to do is I 
want to break up into groups, and I want to show you guys how to do this. 
Notice something too – here, you don’t have to leave right now. Let’s just 
say I just grabbed this guy off the street and I’m just doing this street-type 
hypnosis or demonstration or even if I’m on stage with him. Notice that I’ve 

97
always got my arm on him. I’m always holding onto the guy or the lady. 
Why? Because I want to make sure that they’re not going to fall. I want to 
make sure that I have got all their needs taken care of. 
That’s your role, as a stage hypnotist, a demonstrational hypnotist, the 
street hypnotist, or just as a human being. When you’re working with 
another person, please take it seriously. I’ve seen people get hurt by bad 
hypnotists who don’t know what they’re doing.
I’ve been doing this for over 25 years and trust me, I’ve seen hypnotists 
who say that they’re hypnotists who have been doing this for 20 or 30 years 
and I sometimes I have to choke. I just wonder, what is your point why are 
you doing this? I don’t say that to build myself up, but to let know that it’s 
really serious stuff going on here. 
You can have a seat, thanks, Bill. Give Bill a round of applause and make 
him feel good. 
Applause
If you’re working on multiple people how do you take care of all of them?
When I’m working on multiple people in a stage setting? You take one times 
10 and you multitask. You’re multitasking. When you’re working with a 
group, instead of one person you’re just working with a group. When you’re 
doing in stage presentation you’re working for two different audiences. 
You’re working for the people out here and then you’ve got your subjects up 
here on stage. 
You’ve got to keep your eyes on all these people up here and watch what 
they’re doing, and you have to keep your eyes on the audience, so you’re 
playing to two different audiences. You’ll learn in time how to control this 
and hopefully, you’ll learn enough of that this weekend that you’ll feel 
confident with that. 
You’re going to feel really confident doing it by going out there and just 
doing it. I can’t stress that enough upon any of you is that you just have to 
go out and do it. Get your feet wet and go do it. Knock on doors – and we’ll 
talk about how to knock on doors and get yourself into gigs where you can 
go and do it. 
One of the things that I was very lucky in also was before I began doing a 
lot stage work and I taught hypnosis at a local college for four years too. 
That was cool because at the college, I had 50 or 60 people in my class 
three nights a week, so I got to do a lot of cool stuff. It really helped me to 
hone my skills of speaking to people and doing demonstrations with people 
one-on-one.

I’m going to show you – and Igor’s going to show you. We’re going to show 
you the simple way to get good subjects with no problems up on stage so 
that your show is successful. A group is not different than one you just work 
with more people.
Let me show you one more of these tests and then we’re going to break up 
into groups and we’re going to do it. I need one more volunteer out here.  
This one we’re going to do sitting down. Let’s say that you’ve got somebody 
on stage and he’s sitting down. Because oftentimes, you want to get a little 
playful with people, it’s what you do you’re a performer. You guys are 
performers. When you’re on stage, you’re there for one reason and that’s to 
perform, it’s to give the audience a show. 
Yeah, they come to see all their friends get hypnotized because it’s kind of 
cool, but you know what? Who are they looking at? They’re looking at you. 
They want to know that you are awesome. They’re going to be watching. 
They’re going to look at your hair. They’re going to look at your clothes. 
They’re going to smell you. Everything about what you do. Keep that in 
mind. They’re there to see you, nothing else.

How are you doing, Steven?
Pretty good.
Good. Have you ever been hypnotized?
Yes.
Very cool. Of course you have been. Let’s just say that Steven’s up here 
and he’s part of the show and let’s say that I just started the show and I 
want to do a test with one person. Sometimes I’ll do that I’ll just do a test 
with one individual. Why? Can anybody answer that question for me before 
I even answer it?
Why would I do that? Why would I do a test with just one person in front of 
everybody before I begin? 
Maybe you spotted him beforehand, and you already know he’s going to be 
a flopper. 
Oh, so are you suggesting that me, the highly competent professional 
hypnotherapist, stage hypnotist who’s hypnotized over a million people is 
trying to set up somebody in the audience to come up here to make sure 
that I don’t screw up?
I’m not saying that you planned it. I’m saying that you like to make things 
easy on yourself and might have already said that guy right there is going to 
go. 
Okay. I’m going to hold onto that thought. I’m going to answer this for you 
guys. I’m going to answer it. Yes?
I’m thinking maybe you’re trying to show people how simple it is, how 
simple it is to do, that it’s not going to hurt anybody, it’s going to be fun, 
they’re going to be relaxed and it will make them want to be more 
cooperative. That’s what I’m thinking. 
Very good. Anybody else have an idea on this? Okay, right here?
Is it to show other people how to respond?

Wow, I like that one! Show other people how to respond. Anybody else 
have an idea?  
To build credibility.
Build credibility for who?
For the audience, so they know that you’re a confident, competent 
hypnotist. 
That’s a good one too. Say that again, louder I’m what?
Laughter
How’s that for a waking suggestion? Say it again.
You probably spotted something, maybe he’s faking…
So you think I probably spotted something. Let me tell you something, 
99.9% of the time I’m on stage, there’s a big bright light on me. Do you 
know why performers oftentimes wear sunglasses? Not because they think 
they’re cool, but because the lights are so bright it hurts your eyes. I wear 
them oftentimes on big stages because, number one, you can’t see the 
audience anyway. 
I can’t see the audience. It’s pretty dark out there, so I’m usually flying by 
the seat of my pants. I wear glasses sometimes when I start because it’s so 
bright it hurts my eyes until the lights go down. Do we have one more 
person with a thought on this?  
To start hypnotizing the audience so you can better subjects when you call 
for volunteers.
That’s a good one. Well, let me answer that for you because all of you were 
partially right. You were the most right. I want to show everybody else how 
to respond. I really do. I don’t really care if it’s somebody who’s a flopper, 
because honestly, when I first began, I wanted to do that. I wanted to know 
who they were. 
It’s like I’m not taking any chances. What if this person is resistant, how are 
you going to deal with that? You want to do a show and if all the sudden 
you don’t get this person hypnotized, they’re looking at you like, what the 
hell you doing? All the sudden, you start sweating. It’s like oh boy whew, 
this is not good. Wow. Everybody’s looking at you and you’re just going, oh. 
It just shows up all over you, and it’s not a good thing.
But now, you are learning to become competent, confident professional 
stage hypnotists, the best in the business, right? 

101
Students:
Spencer:
Steven:
Spencer:
Students:
Spencer:
Students
Spencer:
Right.
You have the skills to just walk right through that. So I don’t really care who 
it is, because even if the person does not respond the way that I think that 
they should, I’m going to teach them how to do it pretty quickly.
I don’t have a problem with that. I’ve been doing this long enough that I 
know that some people just need some quick training. It’s not a big deal, 
and that’s the difference between an amateur and a professional. 
The professional will take everything, even resistance, as an opportunity. 
Even if he has to take five minutes to teach the audience what hypnosis is 
and what it’s not. Because oftentimes, when a person does not go into 
trance it’s because you have not done your job properly to explain to them 
what hypnosis is. 
How are you doing?
I’m doing great. 
Hey listen, before we even begin this, let’s do something.
Put your hands out in front of you. Okay, this is pretty cool. Put your 
fingers just like this. Okay. 
I don’t really use this, but do you know what this is? Have you guys done 
this?
Yes.
Did you? How’s it work?
Fatigue.
Magnetic force. I’ve got some land. 
What I want you to do is just look at those two fingers. Get ready. 
What we’re going to do is I’m going to count from 10 down to 1, as I 
do those fingers are going to draw together. They’re going to close. 
They’re going to squeeze the other so tight, just like there’s a vice or 
a magnet just pulling them together. Squeeze them together. 
Look at them right now they’re starting to move together right now. 
10 they’re getting closer and closer. 9 they’re going closer and 
closer. You can actually feel them coming together, just like a vice is 
tugging on them, turning them, getting them closer and closer. 8-7-6 
they’re getting in there closer and closer. They want to squeeze 
:

102
together. They want to touch. When they touch, your eyes will close 
and you’ll just go into a deep trance– 5-4-3-2-1, just sleep.
There are so many different ways that you can do this and turn it into an 
induction. Is this making sense? Any kind of a test can be turned into an 
induction. You are limited only by your own creative imagination nothing 
more, nothing less.

103
Psychology of Demos
We’re going to teach you some very good solid foundational skills that you 
can learn and use. Feel free to take what you learn and build on it. Be 
creative. Your feet are stuck together. Put your fingers on your ears they 
won’t come off they stick tighter and tighter. The more you try to pull them 
off, the tighter they stick. 
Why does that suggestion work does anybody have an idea? 
You can open your eyes and pay attention.  
You’re telling him to hold onto it, but then you’re also telling him to take it 
off, so it’s a conflict of suggestion.
Can you elaborate more on what that conflict would be?
Well, hold it tighter and tighter, but try to let them go is not letting them go. 
It’s just to try, so what you’re doing is giving them two different suggestions.
I’ll expand on that more, later. This is very important. When you’re doing 
suggestibility tests and you’re turning them into an induction, I want you to 
understand what the psychological behind this is. Why does it work?
If I tell somebody that their hands are stuck, try to pull them apart and they 
stick tighter and tighter, why does that work?
It’s just that, as they said, it’s a conflict of interest. You’re telling them hold 
tighter and tighter and then you’re telling them to try, which is to feel. 
That’s interesting and I need to expound on that and make that even 
clearer. Because listen, people are going to ask you why it works. You don’t 
have to tell them, but you need to know yourself why things work, because 
you guys are the competent professional confident stage hypnotists. 
You have got to know this inside and out, why these things work. You’ve 
got to be able to explain it, to know this in your sleep with your eyes closed, 
driving down the road.  
It’s just that you overload by just saying words, it doesn’t matter if it’s pulling 
or holding the ears it just overloads the mind. 
Interesting concept, but that’s not it.

It’s the weaker part of the sentence which is causing the brain. Basically, as 
he said, to try is to fail, so using the weaker part of the system is going to 
make it to where they’re not going to be able to let go. 
Do I hear you saying that you respond to the stronger part of a suggestion 
or sentence if the opposing part is weaker?
Basically. 
Oh, okay very good. If you guys don’t know that, there is a DVD back there, 
How to Hypnotize Anyone at Anytime. Get it. Learn it. Study it. It’s all on 
there, okay. Let’s go onto the next thing.  
It’s pretty much part of the confidence game. In other words, giving that 
person the confidence and yourself that that will happen.
Sure. 
Is that…
No. You can say that, but that’s not true. Do you see what I just did? I kind 
of tricked her did you all notice that? But the professional just keeps going 
and just makes it part of the show.  
You just walk right through it because that’s also part of it. It you move and 
something happens, you just keep going with the flow. Performance is an 
art. When you’re being a stage hypnotist, trust me, it is an art. You’re a 
performer you’re up there to perform. It’s an art and a craft. You’ve got to 
work on it. You’ve got to hone it. You’ve got to shape yourself. Trust me on 
this. It is so cool once you do it.
You guys are actors. This is all an act. You have to build your persona of 
who do you want to be. Who are you? What do you want to be? Hallucinate 
the possibilities and be it. What have you always wanted to be on stage? If 
you could be anything you wanted to be, what would it be? It’s something 
you could think about for a couple of days.
Someone just gave me some information, which is really weird. He was 
telling me that when sobriety tests…
Sobriety tests?
…yeah, he was telling me that…
Was it a police officer?

105
Student:
…
Spencer:
[
]
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
yeah. When a police officer tells you to walk here, they’re controlling you. 
Put your feet together and try to walk that straight line, it’s almost like 
they’re putting that person in a hypnotic trance. The harder they try to walk 
that line, the more likely they will fail.
You can always just refuse the test. 
Laughter
I mean the worst they’re going to do is yank your license for a year anyway. 
Then if you get a good attorney, you’ll probably beat the rap anyway..
I’m still not sure I understand why that works if you tell somebody to stick 
something to a wall or hold your ear and it won’t come lose. What are the 
mechanics of that? I’m not sure I understand why that works.
Okay. Squeeze your hands together. Watch. 
Make your arms stiff and rigid. I want you to squeeze your hands 
together, squeeze your fingers against the back of your hands. 
Squeeze them as tight as you can. The more you squeeze them 
together, the tighter they lock. Try to pull them apart, they stick 
tighter and tighter. Try to pull them apart, they stick tighter and 
tighter.
You respond to the stronger part of the suggestion, if the alternative is 
weaker. Try to pull them apart, they sticker tighter and tighter. The mind 
takes that stronger part at the end and says, got it. Now if a person loosens 
their hands for any reason, I just go wait a minute, listen very carefully to 
what I’m saying. Squeeze them together, make sure those hands are 
locked, they are glued, they are stuck tight and I’ll keep working on them. 
That’s the psychology behind that. We’re going to go on and do some 
conversion.  
It’s challenging.
The professional hypnotist does not take a challenge. If somebody comes 
up to me and says, I bet you $1,000 you can’t hypnotize me. I’d say you’re 
right. Then if somebody comes up to me and says go ahead and hypnotize 
me, see if you can do it. I’ll say okay, $1,000. To me it’s like they’re coming 
up and just being smart asses to begin with. So it’s like, do you want me 
hypnotize you okay, its $1,000 it’s that easy. I’ll be happy to, but you’re 
going to pay me for it. 
So basically, there are cases that you just can’t – the psychology…

106
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
You can, but why do that? Why put yourself in that position, because that’s 
nothing more than somebody who wants to be a bully? Why not just diffuse 
the situation and make a joke out of it. Yeah, I’d love to do that just give me 
$1,000 I’ll help you with that. 
You’ll get people at shows that will do that. They’ll come up to you and 
they’re drunks, they’re just obnoxious people. You have to learn how to deal 
with these obnoxious people. So you can do it that way or of course, you 
can have some big bouncers and just say get them out of here. I’ve done 
that many times. You get all sorts of crazy people. You work in a bar you 
know what crazy people are like. 
I’ve done this for 20 years the best thing to do is have your patrol. Next 
round’s on me boys get them out.
There you go. I wouldn’t buy them a drink though. All right, thank you sir. 
Let’s do this. You don’t have to move your chairs, but I want you to just grab 
the person next to you and move your chairs together. Turn them together 
face-to-face – two, four, six. If you don’t have a partner please find one. 
I want you to practice this. Let’s do the hand lock to induction. You got that? 
Squeeze your hands tighter and tighter. Make sure your arms are 
stiff and rigid as a steel bar. Make sure their arms are stiff and rigid 
as a steel bar, and their hands are locked tight. They are glued and 
they will not come apart. Your fingers are stuck against the backs of 
your hands. They are stuck. They are glued. You cannot pull them 
apart. No matter how hard you try, they stick tighter and tighter.
You watch those people. Make sure those hands are stuck tight. You make
sure those arms are stiff and rigid and they will not bend. If a person goes, 
ahh, you go no stiff, rigid and powerful. You have got to be forceful. 
The stage hypnotist is a very commanding individual. They don’t take guff 
from anybody. You can’t. It’s just the nature of the performance. So you 
really want to do that. No matter if you want to be a comedy hypnotist, a 
serious hypnotist, a dramatic hypnotist or a very suspenseful type hypnotist. 
Look at me now and do not look away. 
I’m in Dubai, right? There’s this Italian guy up. He looked like a Mafiosa. 
You saw that picture of him, Liz. He comes up to me and starts talking this 
Italian thing. He goes, you stuck Italiano. Okay, look into my eyes. Breathe 
in deeply. Sleep. Oh, look at him everybody. Make him feel good he’s on 
the floor. So you can go into all these different things. You’re a showman, 
show woman or a show person. Dig it. Have fun. 

107
Your hands are locked. Once you get that done, take it and turn it into 
induction. Once you’ve got them like that, just grab their arm and say, 
sleep. Then just bring them down. Go for it.

Let me ask you guys, do you feel more confident now than you did five 
minutes ago?
Yes.
I’m telling you, man this stuff is wild. The possibilities are endless and the 
things that you guys are going to be doing when you leave here today will 
blow people’s minds. 
Now, I’m going to call for some questions later when we get done with this 
segment, but I want to move on with what I’m doing right now. So if 
everybody would do me a favor right now. 
Take your hands and put them in the air. Put them down. Lift up your 
right foot. Put it down. Lift up your left foot. Put it down. Go like this. 
Turn them over. Everybody say ahh.
Ahh.
Okay, now here’s my question.  
Everybody stand up. Everybody sit down. Stand up. Sit down. 
All right, what on Earth am I doing? I need you to raise your hand and I’ll 
give you a microphone, that’s the rule of the room. Right there is a guy. 
What on Earth am I doing?
You’re doing compliance entrainment.
Compliance entrainment.
You’re teaching them to follow your commands without thinking about it.
Okay. Could be, but I want to move into the language of the stage 
hypnotist. But that’s pretty technical, I like the way it sounds. 
Laughter
It makes me sound like I’m a dog trainer. Anybody else want to take a shot 
at that? We’re going into the language of the hypnotist. 
I was going to say compliance testing or compliance conditioning? You’re 
conditioning them to respond to you.

109
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Conditioning them to respond. Okay, that could be. Anybody else want to 
take a stab at this? 
Getting used to what you’re saying suggestively?
Okay, that’s interesting too. Here’s one right over here.
You’re getting audience involvement.
Audience involvement, I like that too that sounds pretty good. 
The thought that came to me is that you are positioning yourself as the one 
in charge, the one in control, the leader and what you say goes. Up, down, 
round and round. 
Bad ass, mo fo, boy. You can be whatever you want. 
You’re creating group rapport.
Creating group rapport. I like that too. Very cool. In the hypnotic world, we 
call it simply waking suggestions. You’re all correct – compliance. I try not 
to use that kind of word so much, even though that’s really what we’re 
doing. We do not to create the group psychology and get everybody doing 
the same thing and complying. 
It helps to build more fun with the audience. It helps to build more fun for 
you as the performer. If you get everybody involved doing the same thing 
and it makes it easier when you get to that part where you’re going to grab 
one or two people out and do some demonstrations. Yes, you’re going to 
look for the person who’s happy about responding. 
Take all these things into consideration. The stage hypnotist, his mind is 
always turning, churning and whirling around. He’s multitasking, 
multiplexing, maybe ADHD a little bit. He’s always looking at things that are 
going on with everybody, noticing what’s happening. He looks at the eyes, 
the nose, the ears, the mouth, the breath, the clothes, the way a person is 
leaning one way or the other – up or down, what they’re wearing, are their 
legs crossed or are they wide open. He wants to know everything.
You are an observer of human beings. This is your job. You have got to 
watch everything. No different for those of you who have done it in clinical 
work. If you’ve done clinical hypnotherapy at all, you know that as a clinical 
hypnotherapist, you have got to become your client, right. You have got to 
become your client. To become your client, you have to simply become like 
your client. If you can become like your clients, you can read their minds. 

110
If you can become like your audience, you can read your audience because 
as a performer, all these tests that we’re doing are to bring the audience to 
you. You’re bringing them your way and that’s the biggest role of the 
performer, is man what if I’m losing these guys, what if I’m really screwing 
up? The act is going wrong and I’m not getting what I want. I’ve got 15 
people on stage and I’ve only got two people left. Oh no, what am I doing to 
do?
So you’ve got to work hard to keep everybody up there that you can, to get 
the audience involved. You’ve got to work. You’ve got to keep them coming 
back. How do you keep them in the palm of your hand? That’s what you 
want to do. You want to keep them in the palm of your hand. They’re yours. 
They become butter in your hands. They’re clay and you mold the audience 
like you mold the subjects. You mold everybody. It’s what you do. 
Do you think you can do that?
Yes!
Wow! Some of you are going I don’t know, man I think I just got in over my 
head. How many of you are going, oh no? Anybody out there going uh oh? 
That’s cool, just remember, you don’t have to do what I do, you just have to 
do what I say. Be yourself in whatever it is that you do. That’s really the big 
key to it. 
You’re not going to be like me or anybody else. Be yourself. Be your own 
genuine, authentic self on stage and that’s the only thing that’s going to 
need to come across. You’ve got to let the show be your soul. You’ve got to 
put your soul into it. When you do that, then it becomes real. It becomes an 
art form. Then you can do waking suggestions. You can do tests. You can 
do inductions. 
When people feel that you are real and genuine and you’re just having a 
good time, no matter how you present it, then you’re just your real authentic 
self that’s the biggest suggestion of all.
What is a waking suggestion? 
When you talk about waking suggestions in the hypnosis show, it begins 
with you; when people see you. So, my first experience that’s a waking 
suggestion, they look at it and they go I think this guy is serious. There’s 
something about that that just looks real I think he might be the real deal. 
He might be a stage hypnotist. I can tell by the way he presents that he’s 
not messing around.
You do the same thing. The hypnotic thing begins with your promotion of 
who you are as a human being. It could be on the Internet or it could be 
posters for your show. Does that make sense? When you walk down the 
Students:
Spencer:

111
street, are you a hypnotist? Who are you? These are things that go on in 
your mind, but there’s a time, of course, when you just turn it all off 
because, of course, you can’t be a hypnotist all the time. It gets just a little 
bit nutty. 
It gets really nutty and can become overwhelming, especially if you have 
the opportunity – and someday you will have the opportunity – to travel to 
places where they take very good care of you and you’ll be like this 
celebrity where everybody’s looking at you because you’re all over the TV, 
radio and newspaper. You can’t go anywhere because everybody knows, 
hey, aren’t you… it’s you. Yes.
Pretty soon you kind of go, I just want to go to the beach. Put on the 
sunglasses and hat and disappear. When you get to do that, then it’s kind 
of cool. It’s kind of fun. 
So the suggestion begins with your promotion of who you are as a person 
in your show because that’s why you’re here – to do shows or promotions. 
Whether you want to work on the stage, in a theater or nightclub, whether 
you want to do corporate gigs or whether you use it to hone your 
demonstrational skills in your own business for a group of people to excite 
the imaginations of your clients by doing demonstrations in getting a little 
compliance going there. 
So you get these yes sets that are going on because you want to build 
rapport with everybody and a waking suggestion continues. It continues 
with your promotion on your video with your photographs, with your own 
presence. When people come to your show, the suggestions continue. Your 
show in the showroom or, however, you present that you want it to look 
elegant and cool. 
You have the stage setup, you have your chairs, you’ve got speakers, 
you’ve got a technician back there working and you’ve got a crew. This all 
says, I think this is serious. It’s all put together pretty well. I think we should 
pay attention to this.
These are all indirect suggestions. An indirect suggestion is also a waking 
suggestion. When you go to a doctor and the doctor says oh, you look 
terrible. That’s why you don’t go to doctors.

Street Hypnosis Gift
How many of you were at the one-day training that I did I think it was in 
November over at Lowe’s? How many of you here? When I was here with 
these guys, remember we did the handshake?
You looked awful.
How does that work?
It’s wonderful.
Yeah. Please stand up. So say again. You were at Lowe’s and what 
happened, what was the suggestion. 
You were in the class, and you were teaching. In fact, we walked out and 
then remember that little yogurt place? It was an awesome place. We went 
there and poor little girl, she just looked awful tired. Basically, he showed us 
how us, hey, how are you doing? Oh, my God, you look awfully tired. You’re 
holding their hand and you go, how would you like to feel and have a lot of 
energy right now? Wouldn’t that gift feel good to you? He talked us through 
the whole then.
Then you’re just shaking their hands and on four, you close their eyes and 
make them feel really good and then wake them back up. Boom! Hey, don’t 
you feel great? Isn’t that awesome. You did wonderful. They’re like oh yeah. 
So it was cool. We tried it a Wal-Mart and they wanted to kick us out. 
In fact, I think that is so cool–there are only a handful of you that know that–
I’m going to teach the rest of you that right now. It’s a very cool waking 
suggestion and it’s a good way for you to practice your demonstrational 
skills out there on the strip tonight, out there in the rooms in the casino. Try 
not to do it to the guy flipping cards. Somebody will grab you by the back of 
the neck and then you’ll be in this room where people are beating you to a 
bloody pulp.
I would suggest not near the gambling.
That’s what I’m talking about right there, they take it pretty seriously. Just 
like you are taking it seriously when you’re a stage hypnotist, right? Those 
guys out there mean business and they’re known to thump you.  
I need a volunteer up here please, with this waking suggestion. Yeah, come 
on up here. Eric, how are you doing?

Where are you from?
Amsterdam.
Oh yeah, we talked on the Internet, didn’t we? That’s right. Okay. Good, 
cool. One of the reasons I picked you is because it’s a long flight, right? Is 
the jet lag going down a little bit?
Yes.
I thought you looked kind of bad. No, so I want to help you because if I can 
show you a way to feel a little bit better in less than a minute, you’d like that 
wouldn’t you?
Sure.
Are you getting this? Listen to what I’m doing. Watch. He’s got jet lag. You 
got jet lag you look awful. You’ve got to be tired. I know I just got back from 
Dubai. It’s the same kind of a trip, maybe about six hours more, but its jet 
lag. 
Yeah, I can see that.
You can see that in me?
You’re jetlagged.
I’m jetlagged.
Laughter
Wow, you feel how he turned that around on me. If I could show you a way 
to relax in less than a minute, you’d like that wouldn’t you?
Sure.
Here’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to take your hand and I’m going to 
shake it four times 1-2-3-4 just like that. The first time I shake your hand, 
your eyes are going to want to close down, and that’s fine. 
The second time, they’re going to feel heavier. The third time, just close 
them down all the way and the fourth time, just relax completely. Very cool.
So what I want you to do right now is first, take a deep breathe in 
and exhale. That’s very good. Take another deep breath in. Good. 
The first time I shake your hand, your eyes are going to begin to 
close down. The second time, go ahead and let them begin to close 

114
down. That’s it. Close down all the way. Just relax completely. That’s 
it all the way down.
I’m going to talk to the audience while I’m sitting here swinging your 
arm around. 
What I’m doing is I’m telling him exactly what to do. So pay attention 
because what I’m doing is I’m also, as I’m doing this, I want to make sure 
that he’s loose, limp and relaxed just like an old wet rag, like an old doll. 
Okay? If this arm is still tight, I’m going to still work it out and say there you 
go, just relax it all. Just let it go.
Now, why do I say take some deep breaths? Because …
Breath is the key to relaxation. 
Relaxation is the key to suggestion. 
Suggestion is the key to hypnosis. 
So now we’ve got him nice and relaxed. This is what I like to do. You walk 
up to the person – this is just waking hypnosis nothing more, nothing less. 
You can turn this into an induction. Basically, it’s already an induction. He’s 
already gone. You just say good, just sleep, all the way down. 
Then, of course, your leg is always braced back here – your back leg –
because you don’t want him to fall over. No matter how little you are, you 
just use that back leg as leverage. Just tighten it up so you’re always there. 
Of course, if you’re a guy or gal, make sure you’re not getting whacked 
because it just doesn’t look good. It’s inappropriate, so I say it in jest, but at 
the same time, this is a serious thing too. 
You want to make sure because if something like that happened, it could be 
misconstrued, and you just don’t want those kinds of ramification, especially 
if you’re in a foreign country that really looks down on things like that. 
In a moment, what I want you to do is go inside your body and find a 
place that is very calm and relaxed, just put it right there in your 
stomach. Find a place in your life, put it right there in your stomach 
and put your hand on it please. Good. 
Take another deep breath into that. Good. I’m going to count to 
three. On number three, open your eyes, bringing back that 
wonderful feeling, feeling relaxed and comfortable in every way. 
Here we go 1-2-3, open your eyes, all the way back. Now take a 
long, deep breath. Fill up your lungs and stretch. 
How do you feel? Wonderful! Okay, did you guys see that? Let’s break up 
into groups and let’s do that little experience right there. This is called 
waking hypnosis. Again, the waking hypnosis, I want you to take it from that 

115
into an induction. Did you guys see how I did that? Do I need to show you 
again?
Yes.
Okay. Have a seat. I’ll take one more person very quickly. Sure, come on 
up. It’s the same thing. Find somebody. Oh, you looked stressed out. This 
is what you do. You walk up to somebody – this is a waking suggestion, 
and this works very good if you’re out there and you walk into a restaurant 
or into a store. People are stressed out to the max. They’re overloaded and 
overstimulated with everything that’s going on out there. 
If I could show you a way to relax in less than a minute you’d like that, 
wouldn’t you?
Yes.
Of course you would. So here’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to take your 
hand and shake it. I’m going to shake your hand four times. 
The first time I do, your eyes are going to want to close down. 
The second time, your eyes are going to want to close down even further. 
The third time, just let them close down, and 
The fourth time, just relax completely.  
What I want you to do is take a deep breath in and exhale.
Now remember, I have a person breathe, because breath helps you to 
relax. You get oxygen into the brain and the brain goes ahh, yes. Now if you 
are a smoker, smoking doesn’t relax you, the deep breathing does. –A little 
tip from the hypnotist.–
Take another deep breath in now and exhale. Good. The second 
time I shake your hand, your eyes are going to want to close down 
all the way and the third time, just close them down all the way. 
Good. The fourth time, just relax completely. There you go. 
Do you see how we do that? It’s very simple. Good. 
Relax all the way down. There you go. 
You can do this during class, but don’t do this out there with people on the 
strip that you might have somebody smack you, but here in class you can 
do it because everybody knows that we’re doing hypnosis. So practice it 
here in class. I mean you can do whatever you want. I’m not here to tell you 
what to do.

Good, now just sleep all the way down. Way down. Good. Nice and 
relaxed. Good.
They’re already there. You’re just saying good, now just let it go all the way 
and just sleep. You can do it anyway that you want to. 
On the count of three, open your eyes feeling fantastic. Before I do, 
standing up straight, I want you to go inside yourself, and I want you 
to find a place in your life where you’re totally calm and at peace with 
yourself. Got it? 
Just take that and put it in your stomach. Put your hand down there 
please. Good. Breathe into it. Good. I’m going to count to three. 
Bring that good feeling all the way back with you 1-2-3, eyes all the 
way open now. Take a long, deep breath. Fill up your lungs and 
stretch. Good. How do you feel?
Good. 
Good. See, more waking suggestions. Open your eyes feeling wonderful, 
feeling great feeling good. Give him a round of applause and make him feel 
good.
Applause
Another hypnotic tip for you from the hypnotherapeutic side of this –
because I started as a clinical hypnotherapist, so I worked very hard as a 
clinician for about 10 years, working with everything you could imagine. 
When I do that, when I have a person find a happy time in their life and put 
it in their stomach, it’s because people hold onto anxiety right here. This is 
usually where a person feels stressed, tension and anxiety is right here in 
the pit of their gut. 
So if you can anchor them for this moment to this good feeling, wouldn’t 
that be a cool thing for you to be able to do and for them to be able to take 
with them? Give them a gift. I mean seriously, you’re out there playing with 
people, but give them a gift. Give them something very nice. That’s what 
that’s for. 
Now open your eyes, feeling wonderful. 
All right, let’s have at it. 
We’ve got to move along because time’s running out. You can practice this 
on your break if you haven’t done this. How many of you guys got to do 
three people? How many of you did two? All right, that’s good enough.

When you started off, you were talking about awful tired. I was wondering 
what exactly the suggestion was. Are you feeling awful or are you feeling 
tired? What was the point of that double…
How would you like it to be?
I don’t know. 
However an individual wants to take it there’s no rhyme or reason for either 
one, truthfully. You could just say oh wow, you look very tired. You look 
awfully tired. You look terrible. You can go into all sorts of tangents, but you 
could use you look awfully tired and, of course, there’s that double meaning 
in there, right?
Yeah.
You don’t need to do that. There again, this isn’t about using conversational 
language or mind bending language in this segment. This is just about 
learning how to work with people, how to get comfortable with people. Put 
all the rest of that aside. Wow, you look tired and stressed, man, if I could 
show you a way to relax in less than a minute you’d like that wouldn’t you?
Excellent. Thank you. 
You’re welcome. Did everybody get that? Does that make sense? All right 
good.

Group Hypnosis Demo
Let’s move on to another thing here because when you’re working with 
groups, there will be a part where you will do like a fractionization type of 
relaxation. Not always because groups will be different. Sometimes you’ll 
work with groups where you don’t need to do anything except just look at 
somebody and go sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep. It’s just way cool and it 
looks good. It’s not for every group.
With other groups, we have to do things like, all right, I’m going to teach you 
guys how to relax before we do anything at all. This is another way to work 
with groups. 
This is also about doing suggestibility tests and it’s about getting convincers 
with the people that you’re working with out there so that they know that 
something different is going on with them.
For example, everybody sit back in your chairs. Put your feet flat on the 
floor. Take your hands and put your hands palms down on your lap. All 
right, cool. Before we begin, I’m going to do a little group thing. You guys 
like doing group things, right? All right good. 
Go ahead and close your eyes down all the way. In just a moment, I 
will begin to relax you step-by-step and as I do, simply concentrate. 
What I’d like you to do right now first is just take a long deep breath 
in through your nose and hold it all the way in. Exhale slowly through 
your mouth and just sleep now.
When you hear me use the words “sleep” or “sleep now” during this 
little demonstration, it’s simply a word. It’s a suggestion. It’s an idea 
for your mind and body to relax completely. During your time here 
with me, whenever you hear me use the word “sleep” or “sleep now,” 
it’s simply a suggestion, an anchor for your mind and body to relax 
instantly and completely. 
So I’d like you to think about relaxing all the muscles from the top of 
your head down to the tips of your toes. Think it and you will begin to 
experience it. Think of relaxing all the muscles from the top of your 
head down to the tips of your toes. Think it and you will begin to 
experience it.
Breathe in deeply and breathe out. The deeper you breathe the 
better you feel. The better you feel the more relaxed you become. 
The more relaxed you become, the easier it is for you to follow 
simple hypnotic ideas. 

119
Take another deep breath in and breathe out. Send a wave of 
relaxation one more time from the top of your head all the way down 
to the tips of your toes. Think it and you will be experience it. You 
may even think about taking a blue ray of light and as you breathe in, 
just breathe in that blue ray of light. Send it down to every muscle, 
nerve, cell and fiber of your body. Think it and you will begin to 
experience it.
I want you to make sure that your neck is comfortable. So if you 
would, go ahead and move your head about just a little bit. Move 
your head around and get all the stress, all the tension and all of the 
anxiety of the day out of you. Let it go completely. Move your head 
around and as you do that your head will come to rest. Let it rest 
down on your shoulder or even down towards your chest. Let all the 
tension go. Let yourself relax. Relaxing easily, naturally and 
comfortable. 
You can start by thinking about relaxing the muscles in your head 
and across your face, all the way down into your neck and across 
your shoulders. Let all those muscles become loose, limp and 
completely relaxed. Let it go down your arms, your right arm, your 
left arm and into your hands. Relax. Relax. Relax.
All the muscles in your chest and your stomach let them become 
completely loose, all limp and lazy. Even into your back, all the large 
and small muscles running up and down your spine let them go. 
Think it and you will begin to experience it.
You will experience all the muscles relaxing in your body, your torso 
and down into your legs - right leg, left leg - it doesn’t matter which 
leg relaxes first. It could be your hands, the handiest place to let go 
before your leg does. 
What’s important is that you know how to relax comfortably here in 
the chair in your feet, into your toes, so that every muscle, every 
nerve and fiber is totally loose and limp and completely relaxed.
As you relax, I want you to notice that you do have two arms. You 
have a right arm; you have a left arm. Focus on your arms. Focus on 
those hands. In a moment, I’m going to count from 1 to 10 and as I 
do, your hand, your arm – and it doesn’t matter which one, because 
your body knows which arm is going to feel light and which is going 
to be heavy. 
As I count from 1 to 10, allow that light arm to begin to move and lift 
and rise and drift right up into the air, right up towards the ceiling, 
relaxing you more and more. You might even want to imagine that 
there’s a balloon in front of you. A beautiful balloon filled with helium. 

120
With each number I count from 1 to 10, that balloon continues to 
expand, and as it does that balloon gets lighter and lighter, and 
there’s a string attached to the balloon coming down and it’s 
wrapped around your wrist, the wrist of that arm, that hand that’s 
light. 
On number one now, that balloon begins to move and lift and rise up 
into the air. That string is actually tugging on your wrist. It’s actually 
lifting your arm, your hand up off of your lap, up into the air, up 
towards the ceiling, relaxing you more and more. At the same time, 
your other arm is heavy. 
Number two and three it’s moving, lifting, rising and floating. Number 
four, higher and higher still, coming up all the way. Number five and 
six, that arm now begins to go faster and faster. The more you 
breathe, the faster it goes up into the air at number seven and 
number eight. On number nine, I want you to take that light arm and 
put it directly above your head. The arm that feels lighter than the 
heavy arm, bring it all the way above your head right now. Do it now. 
I want you to make a tight fist above your head. Make a tight fist if 
you would please. I want you to squeeze that hand together as 
tightly as you can. Squeeze it together tighter and tighter. Make sure 
that the hand is tight; your arm is locked tight, it’s like a solid steel 
bar. 
I want you to squeeze that hand together. Make sure that hand is 
locked. It’s glued. It will not come apart. Your arm is tight. It will not 
bend. Try to bend your arm and it’s stuck above your head. Your 
hand will not come apart. Your hand is stuck. Your hand will not 
open. It’s stuck tight. Very good. 
Before you do another thing, simply open your eyes and look around. 
Very cool. Release your hands, release your arms and take a deep 
breath. Now just relax. 
What am I doing here? This is a simple fractionation teaching the mind and 
body how to relax. You as a stage hypnotist will use this often in an 
audience. Why? Well, time’s ticking, I got two minutes to tell you and then 
we’re going to take a break.
You want to find the people who are highly responsive and from that you 
can pick people out of the audience to bring up on stage to do 
demonstrations. Outside of doing this in a stage show environment, just 
using it in a corporate situation or doing demonstrations for corporate 
groups, it’s a win-win situation because you want to find the best subjects, 
and then you can do demonstrations. 

121
The purpose of doing demonstrations for smaller groups is to excite the 
imagination of everybody in the room. Wow, if this can happen for that 
person, what can hypnosis do for me? If it’s possible for them, what is the 
possibility for me?
Some people didn’t have the same response. Maybe their arm didn’t go as 
high or maybe it didn’t move at all. That is not a problem. Within the human 
condition, the human mind, we all have different levels of responsiveness. 
That’s not a big idea to the stage hypnotist. 
When you’re doing stage hypnosis you’re just there for one reason – to 
perform, to excite the imagination and to get the very best subjects up here 
on the stage so that you can do your show. You’re not there to try to teach 
somebody else how to go into trance when you’re up here trying to do a 
show, that’s not what it’s about. 
If you have a subject come up here that wants to try to hypnotized and 
they’re having a hard time, thank you for coming up here. I think you’ll enjoy 
the show more out here. Come back again and try another time. Make it no 
big deal. The hypnotist does not fail. The subject fails by not responding 
appropriately. Make it part of the show, but don’t make a big deal out of it.
I know a lot of hypnotists will get freaked out and go oh, my gosh, they’re 
not responding right. What am I going to do? Just get them off the stage. 
Use good subjects. If you apply a test like this beforehand and you say 
okay, all you people with your arms that are still stuck in there, I think you’re 
going to have a lot of fun come on up here to the stage right now and take a 
seat. 
Does that make sense?
Yes!
My job here is to make sure that you guys go out there and do a good job 
because you know what? You are going to be a reflection of what it is that 
Igor and I are teaching you. So you are going to get the best of the best 
here because we want to make sure that when you guys go out there and 
do that, you’re going to be a reflection of what we’re teaching you. 
Listen, I’m going to have nothing but the best people out there doing the 
best shows around the world, got it.
Yes.
All right. If you’re out there and you’re doing a bad show, I don’t know you.

DVD 5 – Group Induction Secrets, Corporate Inductions
& How to Deal with Problems

Students:
Corporate Group Inductions
Well, let’s get on with it. Where were we? How many of you are confident 
about getting out there and doing this thing now?
Yeah.
All right, we’re there we’re going for it. What are we going to do now? Oh 
boy, look at this. Let’s do some more group inductions. I want to work on 
that some more, because as a stage hypnotist you’ll be doing a great thing 
when doing demonstrations. I’m telling you, this will open the doors to so 
many possibilities for you guys that you’ll be speechless.
Oftentimes, the stage hypnotist will get gigs working with Corporate 
America. Corporate America pays ka-Ching. They pay big money because 
they’ve got big money to spend and they want to do every year for 
entertainment– ka-Ching, ka-Ching.
If you think about it, I mean really, if a company has 500 or 1,000 
employees, they’re paying some big bucks out there. They’ve got some 
money that they’re paying and they’re going to have to pay taxes, but if they 
have somebody for entertainment, that’s a write-off.  
The smart employer, the CEO is going to go wow, HR person, let’s find 
some entertainment. Let’s keep the money right here. Let’s make our 
employees feel good. Let’s do something great for them. That’s where you 
come in.  
Oftentimes, you’ll find that companies will call a hypnotist to come in and do 
things like stress management seminars, because hypnotists are proficient 
in stress management. That’s what you do, I think you do, smoking 
cessation, weight loss type stuff, insomnia or wellness programs that 
corporation’s have.
So, when you’re doing these types of presentations, people have heard 
about you because you have a presence on the Internet and you all have a 
website built. You know that you need to, right? 
Right.

124
Spencer:
[
]
By a raise of hands, how many people in here do not have a website? Stick 
around with me, I’ll hook you up, don’t worry about it. I got you covered 
there. We want you guys to look spiffy-diffy. 
When Corporate America comes knocking at your door and they want you 
to come in to do a presentation, group inductions is the way to begin it. You 
go in there and you might talk about whatever your presentation may be, 
but at some point you’re going to want to do two things. 
i. You’ll want to do a group demonstration for relaxation because that’s 
usually what they call you in for. 
ii. Then from the group induction where you do the demonstration of 
the group induction, you will pick some people out of the audience 
and you’ll bring them up for a one-on-one demonstration. 
That’s when the fireworks begin. This is your moment to shine. That’s why 
they hired you. Because you’re cool, you’ve got the goods, man. You can 
help people relax instantly is what you can do, and you will. This is what 
you’re going to be doing you’re going to help people to relax, to chill and 
feel about themselves. 
Let’s do a group induction again. This time we don’t really have to go all the 
way through it. Now, again, if you’re chewing gum, swallow it or put it 
underneath the chair like you did in school or spit it in a napkin. 
Laughter
The reason I say this is because I’ve seen it happen. I’ve seen people in 
hypnosis chewing on gum and sometimes the gum will fall apart because of 
the acids in your mouth. I’ve seen big old long, stringy globs and it just 
doesn’t look good. 
You can be kind of goofy and play off of that because that’s part of doing 
the hypnosis show. It’s like you’re always looking for improv. As a stage 
hypnotist, you have your routines but you are the master of improv. 
You’ve got to be quick on your toes and light on your feet. See what’s going 
on and go oh, how can I use this to make my show better? What can I do 
with this person? Oh, you didn’t do what you were supposed to do, but 
that’s okay. Why? Sleep. Oh, do it differently then.
So let’s just imagine for a second, so that we can press on through here 
that you’re all asleep, with your eyes closed down all the way. 
With your eyes closed down all the way, just the way that you like it 
to be, both eyes closed down all the way, you can quickly remember 
what it’s like to be so comfortable. In fact, I know that you’re here for 

125
my presentation on stress today and because of that, I’m going to 
help you to make this very simple for yourself.
I’d like you to think of a place that you’ve gone in your mind, in your 
body for a time that’s in your mind because anything you’ve done out 
there is in there, your mind. So if you could just stop and think about 
that place now, a place that you’ve been where you’re comfortable 
and relaxed and nobody will bother or disturb you, I want you to find 
that place right now.
As you begin to think about that place now, then just nod your head 
for me if you would please. That’s right. Now I want you to simply 
breathe into that image. Breathe into that image of that place that 
you’ve been to. Make it as powerful and real as you can without 
trying too hard. 
I want you to make this picture vivid in your mind. Imagine that you’re 
there right now, all the sounds, all the sights, all the smells, all the 
textures and even the taste. Imagine yourself there now. Be there. 
Make this image as real as you can. Expand this image. Make it 
bigger and even bigger. Really enjoy that place. That’s right. You’ve 
been there before.  
Listen, each and every time that you relax, you’re going to relax 
deeper and faster. Each and every time your eyes close, you will 
relax deeper and faster. Every time that you close your eyes with the 
intention of going into hypnosis, you will relax deeper and you will 
relax 
faster. 
Whenever 
I 
say 
the 
word 
“sleep” 
or 
“sleep now,” it’s simply a word, a cue for your mind and your body to 
relax instantly.
Whenever I say the word “sleep” or “sleep now,” your eyes close, 
your body becomes loose and limp and relaxed easily and naturally. 
In this place in this space in your mind where you’ve gone before, 
this is your place, your special place that you can relax comfortably, 
and it feels so good to be there, this place that you’ve been to.
I want you to take another deep breath into it. That’s right. Just let it 
spread out through your entire body. There you go. Yeah, that feels 
so good to be there. That’s right. 
In a moment I’ll count to three, on number three just open your eyes 
and come all the way back and we’re going to talk about this for just 
a moment 1-2-3, eyes all the way open now. Come all the way back. 
Very good. How do you guys all feel?
Great.
Students:

126
Spencer:
Yeah. If you felt better before, you’re feeling even better now. So when 
you’re doing a group, what better way is there? We don’t have to spend a 
lot of time, especially in a smaller intimate group. We don’t have to go 
through a whole fractionization type of relaxation, going from your head to 
your toes. You can simply go into a place that a person’s been to that 
makes them feel comfortable, and you can be there now without wasting a 
lot of time.
So there are many different strategies that you, the professional trained 
competent, confident, powerful state hypnotist, skills and tools that you 
have learned and now today you’ll take with you forever, from this point on 
that you’ll remember, you’ll use. 

127
Regression Demo
So now that you’ve got people in this state and they’re feeling good, it’s like, 
wow, how did that happen so quickly and so easily? What can you now do? 
You can do a demonstration. 
Scratching your head, your name is? Come on up here. You were 
scratching your head so you looked like you needed to come up here. 
Laughter
Wendy?
Yes.
Good. Can I borrow you for a second?
Yes.
This is Wendy and I’m going to borrow Wendy for a second because I just 
want to show you guys a demonstration real quick. Do you mind if I just 
help you relax real quickly?
Sure.
This is very cool. You’re not going to fall over. Your legs are nice and 
strong. Very good.
Take a deep breath in. Close your eyes and lean way back. There 
you go. Loose and limp and relaxed. Good. Now listen very carefully. 
I’m going to drop your arm down to your side and when I do, let’s just 
go back in time very quickly. I’m going to drop your arm to your side, 
and let’s just go back in time to a time when you were just a little girl, 
before 10 years old – a very happy time only – and just be there right 
now.
Where you are is it daytime or nighttime? 
Daytime.
Inside or outside?
Outside.
Are you alone or is somebody with you?

of three, open your eyes and come all the way back 1-2-3, wide 
awake. Good. How do you feel?
Good.
Have a seat here for a second please. Let me ask you something. What did 
you think about that?
That was cool. 
Yeah, going back that quickly. Did you know that you could do that?
Yeah.
You did know that?
Yeah.
Far out. So listen, you guys. When you’re doing a demonstration, I mean a 
regression is a very simple thing to do. When you’re doing it, I only use 
happy times. Why do I only use happy times? 
Abreaction.
So you don’t get an abreaction, right. Is there anybody in here that does not 
know what an abreaction is? Two people, okay. For you who don’t know 
what an abreaction is, it’s having an experience in your body about 
something that happened a long time ago, usually bad.

130
For example,– this is not you– but let’s just say that there is somebody who 
had a bad experience as a child, a little boy or little girl who was maybe 
touched inappropriately. If you say, go back to a time in your life when you 
were younger, I like to cover it and say just a happy time only because if 
you just say go back to any time and all the sudden they’re crying, it’s an 
abreaction. 
They may be reliving this memory and having this physical experience in 
their body that you may not be ready to deal with. If you’re doing a 
demonstration you sure don’t want that to happen in front of a group of 
people that you’re trying to motivate.  
Laughter
They’re going whoa, what’s going on? You’re going, oh boy, I don’t know. I 
always do happy times. Now, is it possible that even if I do a happy time 
that something bad could come out? Yeah. That sucks! It’s happened to 
me, so I’m not saying it can’t happen. Anything that could ever happen to 
any hypnotist has happened to me, so I’m coming to you with good 
information here.
I’ve done all the wrong things so hopefully, I don’t continue to make those 
mistakes. If you have something that happens like that, just deal with it 
appropriately. 
The first rule in hypnotherapy is – does anybody know?
Stay calm. Don’t panic.
Wow! Let me tell you my idea, deal with what emerges. You don’t panic, 
you do stay calm, but whatever happens hey listen, you’re the professional, 
simply deal with what emerges. If something happens, like wow that’s cool. 
Let’s fix that real quick. Let’s just take care of that real quick. Thank you.
Thank you.
Give her a round of applause. Make her feel good.

Get Business Through Demos

Can you see the benefit of doing a group type of induction like that and then 
taking one person out of the audience or out of the group and bringing them 
up and doing a demonstration? When you do that, what goes on in the 
minds of the people in the audience?
I wonder if they can help me later.
Before we answer all these, let’s get some microphones out here because 
I’d like to get some of this feedback. It’s not just you. I should be saying, 
let’s give you a microphone and have you stand up. I sometimes get ahead 
of myself. 
The people are going wow that looks like it works maybe I should get his 
card because I need to lose 30 pounds.
Right. Check that out. I need to lose 30 pounds let me get that guy’s card, 
this is pretty cool. How much is 30 pounds worth?
Two hundred and ten dollars.
Okay, $210 for one session.
Per pound.
Per pound. Or, could it be $2,500 for a program? That’s the only thing I do. I 
don’t sell one-on-one I sell programs. Why? Because, listen, weight loss 
has to do with lifestyle changes folks, and we’re there to help. You can go 
around and you can do one-on-one seminars. Get a bunch of people and 
do a weight loss or a stop smoking thing. 
It’s like a shotgun. Some people are going to get hit in the rear end and 
they’re going to change, and a lot of people are not going to get that big 
blast right in the middle they’re just going to get a little pellet here and there. 
In hypnosis, take the shotgun with one person, you condense it and get 
close up. Change! Get that gun up close. Bam! 
So, when you do it over and over through repetition in a program, the 
results skyrocket and you’ll have more business than you know what to do 
with. Seriously, I worked in a little town for a while and I was only making 
$15,000 a month, but it wasn’t too bad, just doing programs. Really, that’s 
not bad money. 
Who wouldn’t work for $15,000 a month come on, seriously it’s not bad.

Q&A Session
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
The question I remember your asking is; do we see the benefit in doing this 
kind of group work and then finding someone to do a demo with. I guess I 
don’t see the benefit of that if we’re talking about stage hypnosis. I see the 
benefit of that if we’ve been hired by a group to do wellness training or 
something like that, and I guess I don’t see the benefit of doing regression 
in stage work.
Okay.
So, in answer to your question do you see the benefit, no, I don’t at this 
point so help me.
I get it. Whoa. How many people heard me say that if you’re doing this for 
groups like corporate stuff, how many of you heard me say that? What I 
was talking about was if you’re working in smaller groups like corporate, this 
works very well. 
Let’s translate that for a second onto the stage and let’s talk about 
regression and I don’t see the benefit of doing that. Are you referring to that 
as far as working with like in corporate demonstration or on stage?
No, I was thinking in the context of on stage.
Okay, so my question for you would be what do you see troublesome to you 
about doing a regression with somebody on stage?
I’m not sure I see the likely entertainment value of that.
Let me explain that to you then. Here’s the entertainment value because I 
think it’s a blast. Now not everybody agrees with me, that’s okay and that’s 
what’s so awesome about being humans. We can all agree to disagree and 
we can all get along and that’s what’s fantastic. 
I’ve done regressions in my shows since day one, but I don’t do it like this. 
I’ll say in a moment I’m going to count to three, you’re all little children and 
we’re going to go for a rollercoaster ride. We’re going to have a lot of fun 1-
2-3, hi kids. Hi. They’re out there doing all this little kid stuff. 
For entertainment value it’s a lot of fun. If you want to do a stage show and 
not do a regression, you don’t have to it’s no big deal. There’s an 
entertainment value there, but you have to remember you’re not there to 
demean the people up here. 

134
You always want to respect them. So you do it in a way that’s respectful of 
them and be sure you don’t go into something that could be inappropriate 
for little kids. 
Does that make sense? Does that help?
It does help because in different contexts, I do see the value.
Good. I’m glad you found value then. Give him a hand.
Applause
Getting back to where we were as far as you’re doing this corporate 
relaxation thing and getting everybody relaxed and it’s nice and great. Then 
you just picked Wendy you said because she was scratching her head, but 
in other words, you haven’t done a suggestibility. You’ve just done a 
relaxation with a group of us you just picked one person out of there?
Let’s stop for just a moment. What is suggestibility? 
It’s hypnosis.
Stop. Stand there for a second so I can address this again. What is 
suggestibility? No, never mind sit down. Are you getting it? 
I get it. 
Okay. Suggestibility is nothing more than offering a suggestion, whether it’s 
to close your eyes and go into an experience, that’s a suggestion. So there 
are many different ways to approach suggestibility. Did I really pick her 
because was scratching her head? I mean she was, but here’s the way my 
mind thinks. Do you really want to know?
Think of it this way. I kind of look for the goofiest things I can possibly come 
up with. It kind of just throws people off. It’s like, scratching her head, so 
you’re going to use somebody because they’re scratching their head? I 
don’t know. That’s not how I think. There’s no rhyme or reason for it. 
In fact, so much of what I do, I do unconsciously anymore because I’ve 
done it for so long, and it just happens. Sometimes I have to stop and think, 
well, why did I do that? Then I run it through it through my brain and go oh, 
okay, that’s why I did that. If I look at it logically and seriously and 
unbiasedly, I’ll go oh okay, that’s why I did it. I have to question myself, so 
thank you for questioning me.

Yeah, the entertainment value for the regression well, you’re up there 
advertising yourself, you’re advertising your different services and you’re 
showing the people what you can do. Some people might say well yeah, I 
need to go back to that time to address that situation and deal with it. It’s 
like handing out a business card, isn’t it?
Exactly. Listen, even during a show when you’re doing a presentation and 
you do a regression or no matter what you do, trust me on this. People are 
going to come up to you at the end of the show and they’re going to go, 
wow, that was amazing. 
I’ve got this cousin… 
I’ve got this brother… 
I’ve got this wife… 
My husband… 
Or me…
Its like, can I lose weight? 
I want to stop smoking. 
I’m stressed can you help me with this?
So the presentation of the stage show is to excite the imagination. You may 
want to only be a performer. That’s great. Go out and be a performer. You 
may never want to do therapy at all. I personally do not like doing therapy. 
I’m done with it. I will work with people though, because they pay me money 
to do it. I don’t mind taking money, but it’s not what I do or pursue in my 
everyday life.
I’m kind of like, argh. I tried it, it creeps me out, but that’s my own trance 
thing. I need help with it I need to see a hypnotist. 
I’ll give you my card.
There you go. I’m very happy doing what I do. I love doing stage work. It’s 
my deal, but there’s so much value in doing that presentation because 
people will come up to you. 
Because you have excited their imagination, they look at you and go, wow 
you are the one you can help. You’re the missing link. I’ve been to all these 
other people, but there’s something about what you’ve done, what I’ve seen 
about who you are that I think I can get some help. 
Trust me on this. One of the neatest things that I hear from people is, like I 
believe that you can help me. If I can help one human being make a 
significant positive change in their life because of what I do as a showman, 
my whole day is made. 

136
I don’t really care about the entertainment. I love doing entertainment, but if 
somebody comes up there and says, I know you can help me and if I can, 
wow. For me, that’s the bonus there, but I hate doing therapy. 
I don’t like doing it that much. I really don’t like it, but I will because I can do 
it very well. I’ve done it for a long time, and it’s a very natural process, and it 
will become natural for you too. You’ll find as working with large groups that 
you’re going to begin to notice things about people that you’ve never 
noticed before about people individually. And you’ll know things about 
people individually in a group that you’ve never noticed in a group before. 
It’s amazing. 

137
Short Group Inductions
Let’s do another group thing here. I need a volunteer. Eric, I haven’t seen 
you up here. Come on up here. Let’s just imagine for a second Eric, that 
you’re a hypnotist. 
I am. I’m a master hypnotist.
Master Hypnotists don’t chew gum in front of other people on stage.
My bad all right. 
Pretend you didn’t see him do that.
Hey, I’m just trying to be compliant. 
I know it’s very cool. Here’s what I want you to do very quickly because I 
want you to have an experience here. Okay, you’re a Master Hypnotist, 
right, correct, you’re cool; you’ve got it all down?
Absolutely.
Everything’s happening. Everything’s flowing. Okay, good. Let’s just 
imagine for a second that you’re doing a stage show and it hasn’t begun, 
but you’re going to do this quick induction. You only have like 30 seconds to 
do it with a group. Here’s your group. You’ve got 30 seconds.
On you?
No, not me the group.
I’m doing the group? Okay. All right. 
I’d like everyone to stick both hands out in front of you and I want 
you to slap them together and rub them real fast. That’s right. Faster, 
faster, faster. Now I want you to take them like this and start 
pumping them like you’re milking a cow. That’s right. Pump them like 
you’re milking a cow and slap.
All right, now I want you to imagine that you’ve got a magnet in front 
of them. Feel that fuzzy, buzzy feeling in your hands. The magnet is 
squeezing them together, just like that and when they touch you’re 
going to drop your hands down and you’re going to go into trance. As 
soon as they touch, they’re going to drop down and go into a trance.

Close your eyes. That’s right. Deeper and deeper down you go. The 
deeper you go, the better you feel. The better you feel the deeper 
you go. And counting 1-2-3, eyes wide open, wide awake, fully alert, 
feeling wonderful in every way. 
Give him a round of applause and make him feel good. Thank you. 
Applause
Wow that was fast! That was good. I gave him 37 seconds. Not bad, right. 
Very cool. I like that. See how he did that? You guys can do that too. I don’t 
think I’ve ever done it that fast. That was awesome. 
See what happens when you put a little bit of pressure on people. You’d be 
amazed at the things that you could actually accomplish when you’re put in 
a position to do it. When you’re told to do it, you have to, it’s like if you’re life 
depended on it, you can do it. 
Here’s what we’re going to do. Let’s divide up into two groups. Linda, I don’t 
know who you are. Stand up, please, since you’re just right there in front. 
You can be the leader of this group. Arthur, you look like a powerful 
hypnotist. Why don’t you stand up? You’re nervous, aren’t you? What 
comes next? You do. 
Here’s what I want you to do. This is your group here. You guys focus on 
him and imagine that you don’t hear any of this stuff over here. So this is 
going to take some action on your part to focus Arthur, he is your hypnotist, 
your presenter. 
Linda here is yours. You guys over here ignore them. Just focus over here 
on her. It’s going to take all your active participation to do this. With that 
said, I want you and you to be hypnotists to your respective audience for 
the moment and I want you to simply show me what you can do as a group. 
You’ve got one minute to do a group induction.  
After you do the group testing here, I want you to turn it into an induction by 
taking one or two people out of there and ripping them down quickly. You’ll
bring them up here. You’ve got one minute and then you’ve got one minute 
to bring them up, so you’ve got two minutes total, beginning right now. 
Okay, have a seat. Give everybody a round of applause.
Applause
In the group induction, when you’re working with groups and doing groups, 
there are a few tricks of the trade. I’m not sure it’s really a trick of the trade; 
it’s just deepeners, using language skills in order to produce a deeper, more 
powerful trance.

If you’ve been listening to what I say or what Igor has been saying – did we 
begin today? It’s been a long day and we’re not even halfway through. 
Listen to what we do. 
For example, when you close your eyes, go ahead and close your 
eyes, I want you to pay attention for a moment with your eyes closed. 
Listen to what I have to say this is very important, because I think 
you’re going to benefit more from it from the inside than from the 
outside. With your eyes closed down, I want you to notice that you 
breathe. 
As you breathe, your breath relaxes you even more. The more you 
breathe, the better you feel. The better you feel, the deeper you relax. 
Listen to the words. The words I continue to use are compounded 
words that help you to relax. It doesn’t matter how you relax because 
your mind and body knows how to get you there quickly, easily and 
gently. 
As you go ahead and get there, as quickly as you want to, you can 
slow everything down inside and just be there because when you 
relax your head and your shoulders, everything follows all the way 
down your body. Every suggestion that you get is compounded upon 
another suggestion. Listen. 
Whenever I say the words “sleep” or “sleep now,” your eyes close, 
your body relaxes completely. Why do I say the words sleep or sleep 
now? Listen. It’s an anchor. You’re anchoring individuals to a state of 
relaxation so that when you’re working with them as a group or 
individually, in your state hypnosis presentation, all you need to do is 
say the words “sleep” or “sleep now.” Their eyes will close and their 
body will become loose, limp and relaxed.
This is one of the tricks, I guess, of the stage hypnotist. It’s to reinduce 
trance very quickly. Now the audience does not know this, but you know 
this now, what you’re doing. You just make it part of the show so it seems 
like it’s just a part of the show because nobody really thinks about it. You’re 
the one who knows it, and you’re the one who thinks about it. 
Whenever I say the words “sleep” or “sleep now,” your eyes close 
and you relax completely. The more you breathe, the better you feel. 
As you continue to relax, you’re going to hear music. The sound of 
the music helps you to relax. You’ll even hear sounds. Every time 
you hear the audience applause, it just helps you to go even deeper 
and deeper into hypnosis.

140
If the person next to you moves or touches you or if you feel them 
shift in their chairs, it simply helps you to relax and go even deeper 
into trance. Every time your eyes open and close, you just sink 
deeper and deeper. You let go a little bit further, quicker and faster. 
Open your eyes and come back for just a moment, please. Okay, 
good. 
Now I want to get a little bit of feedback on this because I want to make 
sure that you guys are all following me with what I’m saying and with what 
I’m doing. Is there anybody that does not understand what I just did? If 
there is, please raise your hand. 
Okay, everybody understands. You not sure you understand? How many of 
you are getting totally bazonkered and wasted? Oh, I love it. We’re wearing 
down all resistance. –Resistance is futile.–
I’ll tell you what, what’s going to happen is that you’re going to take away 
from these next four days and everything that you learn here you’re going to 
walk away and at some point, all of the sudden you’re going to go, whoa 
wow! What can I do now? You’re going to be going out there and busting 
down doors. You’re going to be taking over the world. Well, after me. We’ll 
all go there together. Let’s all go on the journey together, shall we?
Was that the fractionization to keep saying it over and over again, saying 
sleep and sleep now? I’m a little confused on that.
When you’re working with a group, whether it’s a group out here or you’re 
audience up here on stage, it’s nothing more than just continued 
deepeners. I just continue to deepen the trance and give suggestions. 
They’re just multiple suggestions and I just trailer one on top of another.
Every time your eyes open and close, you will go deeper into trance. 
Whenever I say the word “sleep,” your eyes close. Your body relaxes. 
Every sound around you helps you to relax. Everything becomes a 
suggestion. Everything is a suggestion. 
When you sneeze, relax and go even deeper into sleep. If you get an itch, 
itch it and relax into that feeling. So everything becomes a suggestion. 
Everything becomes suggestibility because everything in my world is 
hypnosis. Hypnosis is nothing more than suggestion. 
A suggestion is nothing more than well, look around. You have people with 
long hair, short hair, black hair, gray hair, orange hair, no hair. It all 
suggests something to us, right? I mean we’re all a product of our 
environment. Everything is a suggestion. So as a performer, how you 
appear on stage suggests something to people. How you look and how you 
dress. 
Student:
Spencer:

141
Do you wear one watch or two? What does that suggest? The guy’s crazy. I 
don’t know. I always want to know what time it is. I’m not taking any 
chances. I got two time zones I’ve got to watch out for. Actually, I do it 
because I can. How’s that? That’s the thing.
Is it the stage hypnosis version of like a boilerplate? Is that kind of what 
you’re talking about? Whatever happens makes you go deeper.
Exactly, yes. What’s a boilerplate, I’m not familiar with that?
That’s something Igor taught us when we were doing hypnotherapy training. 
The boilerplate for safety reasons so nothing else messes with your client, 
any external noises. Making them go deeper, it’s the stage hypnosis version 
of a boilerplate.
Right. Anything you do in therapy is the same thing. If you’re working with 
somebody in a clinical setting and you happen to have an office with a lot of 
noise around you, it’s like, as a person walks down the hallway, just let that 
sound relax you even more, so yeah.
The human mind is a fragile thing, and it’s in your hands. Treat it very kindly 
and with respect. I live in a little place called Montana. Does anybody know 
where that is? I live in Kalispell, Montana. Does anybody know where that 
is? No. It’s that way, north. It’s that close to Canada.
They’ve got this place up there called Big Mountain where we go skiing. I 
was skiing a couple of weeks ago with my son who is 6 ½ years old. All the 
sudden, he’s become this skier. The other day we were skiing and I’m 
skiing backwards and I’m watching him. He’s like this, going like this with 
his hand behind his back because he doesn’t use poles. I do because I 
learned with poles, but he didn’t. So he’s back there going like this, going 
look at me. Then he goes, I’m a bat. Kids are crazy skiing.
You never know what’s going to happen. I’ll get back to that later. I go off on 
these tangents in my own mind, but I hope that you can enjoy the ride every 
once in a while. 
Laughter
The mind, treat it with respect. So I try to treat people with respect like I do 
my little guy. It’s the same thing you do as a stage hypnotist. You never 
know what’s going to happen, but you do the best you can. 
If you have somebody that really seems to be having some difficulty, you, 
the trained professional, analytical and highly competent hypnotherapist –
not the stage hypnotist – will use your mind, and you say listen, here’s my 
card. Please give me a call afterwards I’d like to see you. No cost. No

charge. Come and see me in my office the first session is on me. Take care 
of them.
Always take care of them. Be cool that way, if you can. If you’re not in town, 
refer them to somebody that maybe you know that would help you do that. 
Does that make sense? All right. So always do that if you can. It’s the nice 
thing to do.

Student:
I hope that’s it’s a good time to ask this question, although the previous 
presentation made it a bit weird now. I want to ask you, what would you 
suggest, how would you cope with people from the college, for example. 
You get on stage, and you have people laughing. How do you deal with 
that? How do you deal with people laughing – because I found it very hard 
to actually induce hypnosis to them.
I’m sorry you find it hard. Why do people laugh? That’s a good question. I 
want to open that up. I want to pick your brains. Let’s find out why they 
laugh. I could sit up here and give you all the answers and I know that if you 
asked that question there are more people that have the same question.
The stage hypnotist has to dance on his feet. Why are they laughing? Let’s 
see if we can figure it out.
A lot of times in street hypnosis, you invade a person’s space or you ask 
them to look into your eyes. The person looking into your eyes, this is very 
intense, they get very nervous and start smiling and laughing. They might 
even do a few other things. 
Interesting. Any other thoughts on that? Why does the person laugh if 
you’re trying to hypnotize them?
I was saying nervousness. 
They’re laughing because they’re nervous?
Yeah. They don’t know what’s going to happen. 
They don’t know what’s going to happen. Could very well be. 
She stole my answer.
I would say it could be an emotional release. They’re losing control a little 
bit and they’re just laughing about it.
They could be having a good time. They could be entertained. 
Yeah, they could be just drunk, if you’re at a 21 and over venue.
They could be with a bunch of their buddies and they don’t want to look like 
the odd man out, so they’re just grouply making fun of or laughing at you.

144
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Students:
Could be. Now, I’m going to answer that the best way that I can for you. 
Why do people laugh? Who knows why they laugh. I have no idea, but 
usually laughing and crying are two the extremes. It’s a release of anxiety. 
For example, if a person is laughing it’s just a way for them to release 
tension for the most part. That’s what they’re doing, it’s kind of a way for 
them to let go of tension because they’re kind of nervous to be up there, 
that’s one way that the human psyche releases anxiety and apprehension is 
by laughing.
I’ve had people sit there and laugh and laugh and laugh. It’s kind of like, I 
think don’t stop now. Let it out. Just let it out, man. Just go with the flow. 
Get it out of you. They’ll be laughing and laughing and I’ll go okay good. 
Sleep! Just take them down. It’s the same thing. Do you see what I’m 
saying? 
You can use that as a rapid induction, as a shock induction because they’re 
laughing and so it’s kind of like ah, sleep! What? Okay. They may get up 
and laugh at you again. So you just go through it again. Did that answer 
your question?
Yes. Basically, I think you suggested shocking induction, a rapid induction. 
Well, I don’t know that I recommend anything. It’s hard to say because 
every time that you go out and do a performance.
I’m saying that’s a possibility. The bigger answer is I don’t know. I wish I 
could say if this happens, you do this, but it doesn’t work that way. You 
have to be quick on your feet and you just every situation differently. So 
maybe I could do that as a shock induction. It could work beautifully. Maybe 
I could say, listen, I think you’d have a lot more fun laughing out there and 
just take them off the stage. 
A lot of it comes through experience of doing a lot of shows, working with a 
lot of people, learning how to read a person and read your situation on 
stage. I’ve done thousands of shows, thousands. I can’t even count how 
many. I’ve forgotten. Everything is different. The thing is if somebody is 
laughing and you try something and it doesn’t work, do something else.
One size does not fit all in hypnosis, especially on the stage. However,
when people come to your show – stage hypnotists – they come to whose 
show?  
My show.

Spencer:
That’s right. When they come to my show – let’s just pretend it’s your show, 
and they’re out there and you’re doing your group induction, when people 
come and they’re sitting out there, you come out there boldly because they 
have announced you. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, please put your hands together for the world’s 
goofiest hypnotist. Be whatever you want to be, the world’s goofiest 
hypnotist. How many of you out there want to be hypnotized? Oh good you 
do, sit back in your chairs we’re going to have a good time right now. It 
doesn’t matter because you are the commander of the show.
However you want to come across, you come across. However you set 
people at ease is how you do it. However you create rapport, because it’s 
all about creating rapport with your audience and every audience is 
different. If somebody hires you as the world’s goofiest hypnotist, they’re 
expecting the world’s goofiest hypnotist. 
So if you go out there as the world’s goofiest hypnotist and that’s what they 
expect, but you go out there and you’re not, do you think they’d take you 
seriously as being the goofiest? Well, maybe, but probably not. So you lose 
rapport with people right away. That goes back to suggestibility, waking 
suggestions and waking hypnosis. Your show begins with who you are in 
your promotions. 
So when you go out there, you better dang well be that which you are 
because that’s what they expect, nothing different. Don’t try to do a change-
up. Be your genuine authentic self. 
Yeah, not so much a question, but maybe I can get into agreement with you 
on something. It had a little bit to do with what this fellow was saying earlier. 
In my mind – and I think there’s an old saying that life is a stage. I mean 
basically, I went out in the warehouse and did two guys that were on smoke 
breaks that work here. 
What did you do?
Hypnotized them. Point is everywhere is a stage. In other words, in my 
mind I don’t differentiate between a stage with five chairs up there or six 
chairs up there with people getting up there. Even if you’re at a Lion’s Club 
or wherever you’re at, that is stage hypnosis or if you’re in a living room with 
your friends, stage hypnosis. Or you’re at Denny’s, stage hypnosis – in my 
mind.
That’s good because, as you just said, that’s in your mind and that’s a good 
place, because when you begin with it in your mind, that’s where it begins. 
The whole role of the stage hypnotist begins in your mind. My mind. You 
can change your mind at any time, if you don’t mind. 

146
There are times when I don’t want to be a stage hypnotist. When I go to 
Montana, I’m just a dad. I’m just a dad that hangs out with his kid and I kind 
of dig that role. That’s probably my favorite role, just going out there and 
hanging out with my boy, because I have him half the time. I go out there 
and hang out with him, and we just do cool things that dads and kids do – I 
hope most dads and most kids. We just have a blast. 
My son, I’ve got to tell you, man he sees what I do all the time and now he 
goes around going, sleep now. He’s getting it down. The other day he goes 
I want to be in a play. I’m going oh boy, here it comes. Now he wants to be 
in a play. I can see this coming out, another little guy in there.
I want to do some more of these suggestibility tests. Do you guys feel pretty 
good about suggestibility tests? Do you want to practice some more. 
Yeah.
I don’t know. I want to kind of open up this segment to you because I want 
to know what you want from me in the next 20 minutes. I mean we’ve got a 
lot more to do tonight and in the next three days, but what do you want from 
me in the next 20 minutes that revolves around groups and 
demonstrations?
More suggestibility tests.
I hear that one. Shout out loud.
More practice. 
Got it.
Short group inductions.
The ones you had us do are much shorter than the time you allowed for
yourself to do us.
Oh. How unfair is that?  
I have a question. You had two people stand up here and show us 
something. I’m not sure what we were supposed to get from that and where 
that was supposed to go.
What I wanted to do was I just wanted to have an idea of where people are 
at in their own minds with themselves and with a group. So that was for me 
to see what they’re doing with a group and where their level is.

Let’s go ahead I want to do some more, short group inductions and then 
we’re going to do more suggestibility tests for the next 20 minutes. Is that 
fair? Because I want you guys to go out of here at lunch time or at dinner 
time, and I want you to really use what we’ve done here and get good at it. I 
want you to feel good about what I’ve done here with you.  
I take a lot of shortcuts because I think there’s a quick way to get to doing 
stage hypnosis rapidly without a lot of technical stuff.

148
The Easiest Group Induction
Spencer:
Let’s do another group thing, and you want to see a faster group thing? Let 
me take you through this one. I did this at the last training at Lowe’s. Those 
of you who were there may remember this. This is a pretty quick one. This 
is another little journey through your mind and you can use this one with a 
group.   
This works beautifully because anybody can do it. There’s absolutely no 
resistance, and that’s what the stage hypnotist may run into more than 
anything is resistance by people saying, I cannot be hypnotized. I cannot do 
any of that. That’s what happens even to the hypnotist. 
What I want you to do is close your eyes. I want you to for just a 
moment imagine that you’re standing out in front of your house. It 
could be an apartment. It could be a duplex. Wherever you live, I 
want you to imagine that you’re standing out there right now looking 
at it, and there’s nobody there inside except you’re going to be going 
there in a moment. 
When you find yourself standing out there in front of that dwelling of 
yours, nod your head, and do that very quickly. Very cool. Let’s go a 
little bit further. Let’s walk up to the door. Walk up to the house. I 
want you in your mind’s eye to go ahead and open the door. Maybe 
you’re turning a knob or hitting a latch. Go ahead and do that.
You’re going to walk inside. There’s nobody there, but as you walk 
inside, I want you to notice the surroundings. I want you to go to your 
front room where there’s maybe some knick-knacks and furniture 
whatever’s in there. As you notice that, once again, please nod your 
head. Very good. 
You’ve all been to your home before so you know exactly what that’s 
like, but it’s been a long day. What I want you to do is find a place 
that you can relax. Maybe it’s the couch. Maybe it’s a chair. Find that 
now. Sit down or lie down. 
When you find yourself sitting or lying down, once again nod your 
head, please. Very cool. Now, I want you to notice yourself sitting 
there or lying there, and you’re going to go ahead and sleep for a 
little bit. Maybe you’re going to take five or 10 minutes. 
Take a deep breath in and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, 
just notice yourself sitting there or lying there just going into a deep, 

149
deep sleep, becoming relaxed and comfortable, everything turning 
loose. 
As you notice yourself sitting there or lying there going into a deep 
sleep, time is drifting by slowly. It’s almost as if time is speeding up 
now as one minute goes by, two minutes, five minutes has just 
drifted by. Ten minutes. Fifteen minutes has gone by and you’ve 
been sitting there or lying there relaxing.
You notice yourself now sitting there or lying there, and it’s time to 
wake up because you’re starting to feel a little bit hungry. So you 
notice yourself waking up there, and you get up off the couch and 
you go into the kitchen.
In the kitchen, you’re hungry and so you look inside the kitchen for 
something to eat, something that has your name on it. You go into 
the refrigerator or you go into the cupboard and you prepare that 
meal very quickly. Go ahead and just take a bit of it because you are 
hungry. Go ahead and take a bit and really let that roll across your 
tongue in your mouth, taste that. Oh boy, that tastes good.
As you begin to taste that food and have that sensation, rolling down 
across your tongue and down your throat, nod your head once again, 
if you would please. Very good. Yeah, that’s awesome. That’s good. 
Now go ahead and open your eyes. Come all the way back for a 
moment please. Okay, great. 
Now, I’m sitting here and I’m watching each and every one of you. Trust me 
on this, this is a hypnotic induction. What can you do with this? You can do 
many things with this in a group or individually. You’re leading a person 
every step of the way. 
When you find yourself standing out in front of the house, nod your head. 
You get the head nod. All right. They’re with me. Walk up to the door. 
Reach down. When you have the handle, nod your head, another good 
sign. Walk inside. Look around. When you notice all the surroundings, nod 
your head. 
You are on a roll, hypnotist. Notice yourself sitting down or lying down 
because it’s been a long day. Take a couple of deep breaths in. Breath is 
the key to what?
Relaxation.
Relaxation is the key to what?
Suggestions.

Suggestion is the key to what?
Hypnosis.
We didn’t even tell them what we were doing, did we? We’re hypnotizing 
these people. See yourself relaxing there. Take a deep breath and just 
relax, all the way down. Take a minute, take five, take 10, however long you 
need. But now it’s time to open your eyes and get up and go into kitchen 
because you’re really hungry. 
So you get up and when you notice yourself getting up, nod your head. 
Going into the kitchen and looking around, finding something good to eat. 
Eat it. Take a bite. Taste it. Savor it. Experience it on your tongue and in 
your mouth. That’s delicious, isn’t it? Nod your head. When you really got 
that, open your eyes. 
Okay, now I’m curious. When I point to you, tell me what you ate. 
Sushi. 
Cake.
Swiss and pepperoni sandwich.
Cheerios.
Can you see what’s happening here. We’ve just taken a group 
demonstration, a suggestibility test, is all it is. Now can you take that and 
turn that into an induction? Or are we already induced? I mean there’s a 
fine line there.
Even when you do a suggestibility, just think about it. Is it already an 
induction, or are you following through with an induction just to deepen the 
trance? As a performer, you are there to perform. You already know that a 
person is in trance, when a person steps up to your stage. 
If you’ve done your job right, most of the time, because there are still times 
when you’ll have to drop people off the stage, when you’ve done this kind of 
a presentation. Beforehand you already know you’ve got a stage full of 
people, who are already in trance, before you even begin to do your show 
and the rest of it is fluff, filler and presentation. Your style and this is where 
you get to shine. 
People, believe it or not, like to see people getting hypnotized for some 
crazy reason. Even though you’re doing this out there already to everybody, 
it’s like those of you who really have something good, who can really feel 
yourself salivating, I want you guys to come on up here and have a seat. 
Let’s have some fun.  

151
How many of you salivated? Raise your hands if you salivated. All right. 
Good. We’ve got a bunch of you that salivated. You salivaters come on up 
here. You see? I want you salivaters. You bring them on up because you 
know you’ve got yourself some very good subjects. 
Even though you’ve got your good subjects up here – the salivaters – you 
still may have some people up here that won’t go any further than that, and 
you’ll have to send them off the stage. No big deal. Make it a part of your 
show. Don’t be stressed out about it. 
What I want you to do is, go ahead and pick somebody you have not 
worked with yet please. I’ll give you like three minutes to run through that 
and then the other person, do it to the other one. Let’s run through that.
Remember, you’re doing a simple visualization that’s very simple that 
anybody can do.

Is everybody paying attention? She had a question here, and I want to 
address that. Her question for me was – she was wondering – she said, I 
don’t know that I feel comfortable if I’m out there in the real world having a 
guy come down on my happy place.  
That’s a good question because in different cultures, for example, over in 
Saudi Arabia. You do not touch the ladies. You do not touch their head. You 
keep your distance. How do you do hypnosis that way?
Here, the thing is well, can we do this without – it’s like, I don’t want a guy 
down there. I don’t want that impression. Simple. You can do something like 
this. Just close your eyes and just sleep. So just do that and just keep them 
off of that part like that. Does that make sense? Or you can do the same 
thing. You can be next them and say, just close your eyes, just sleep. Just 
keep their head – you can control the environment at all times. 
Does that make sense to you guys? All right. Do you guys know how to do 
that? Are you comfortable with that? Okay, good.
I feel comfortable in here. I’m just thinking out in the world. 
The other thing you can do if you’re working with somebody of the opposite 
sex, it’s the same thing. You can simply just have him sit down and do 
nothing else. Have him sit down and just say, take a deep breath, and just 
close your eyes and just sleep. So you can do the same thing without 
having to get them close. 
There are always ways around that. Open your eyes come all the way back. 
You guys know how to do that, correct? You’re comfortable with hypnotizing 
people just sitting there. It’s the same thing or standing up without having all 
those touchy things. Are you good?
Yeah.
All right. Thank you. Okay, good.

here, and I’m kind of curious. How old are you?
I turned 16 on June 3rd.
He turned 16 on June 3rd.

Why are you here? I want to know this for myself. 
He wants to get into bars.
His dad made him come. Oh, I see. This is his dad right here. Why are you 
here?
I think hypnosis is a powerful skill. As Igor said at the beginning, it’s a skill 
you can have for the rest of your life. You can also use it to help other 
people, and I might use it to go into the field of medicine. I might now, but 
either way, I’ll always have something I can use to help other people and 
help yourself.
Very cool. All right, good.

I wanted to know that because the first time I ever did hypnosis, I was 12 
years old. So what sparked my imagination was when I was 12 years old, I 
had a girlfriend and she taught me how to hypnotize her. Her father was in 
the Navy and it just was like playing Simon Says when I was 12, right? I 
never forget that experience, and it just stayed with me forever. Here I am. 
Now that I’m 22, I’m still doing it.
Laughter
Hey, what are you laughing about? Come on.
Benjamin Button.
Benjamin Button. I’m curious, aren’t I? And you’re going to be curious about 
just how young I am. I think with that, I think we’ve got about another minute 
left. You guys got some good skills. I would encourage you during dinner to 
eat dinner because we’ve got more stuff coming at you. 

154
We’re going to take everything that we’ve learned today, we’re going to 
wrap it up all into one package and see how it all works together so that we 
can all do it as a group, going from A to Z with everything we’ve learned 
today because tomorrow we’ve got a huge day coming at you too. Yes, we 
have 10 seconds.
Is it appropriate in stage hypnosis to do the one where you fall back? Do 
you know what I mean?
The sway test? Good question. He’s talking about the sway test. Let’s take 
dinner, after dinner I’ll take a few minutes and show you how to do the 
backward sway test. It’s very cool.

The Sway Test
The sway test. We left that off, so we’re going to do the sway test right now, 
right here in Las Vegas, Nevada. I need somebody I don’t know and that 
I’ve never hypnotized. Come on up here, your arm was up there quick.
Applause
Brian, do I know you?
Nope.
This is the sway test. There again, I’m going to show you how this works, 
and then you can do this and you can turn this as a test into an induction. 
There are two different ways that you can do this. I want you to be very 
careful of the person you’re working with because, if they fall over on top of 
you, you can both go down to the ground and you don’t want that to 
happen.
Let me move the chairs out of the way. It’s kind of like if you do a rapid 
induction and you say, sleep. If you’re a little guy or a big guy, you’ve 
always got this leg planted behind you, right? Leverage. It’s the same thing 
with the sway test.
For example, if I take him this way – and you can go frontwards or 
backwards, but I’ll go like this. Just close your eyes down. Now, I’ve seen 
this done a number of ways. There is not a right way to do it; there’s not a 
wrong way, some people are just a little goofier than others. Be whatever 
you want to be. A lot of this stuff I just find kind of goofy to begin with and I 
don’t even know why I do this. 
Some of the things that people do, they’ll kind of – put your feet together, 
please. I want you feet together because you have more of an off-balance, 
right? It’s easier to get somebody off balance that way. You want to make 
sure that you hold onto them because they could fall over, so you want to 
be careful.  
Eyes closed. All right, here’s what I’m going to do. In a moment I’m 
going to take my hands off your back. When I do, you’re going to 
feel…

156
Watch what I’m doing. I’m not doing anything, but because I’m holding him 
like this and he’s already kind of off balance when I release my hands, 
automatically he’s going to start coming backwards. So the psychology here 
is this, you’re a magic person. 
In just a moment, I will take my hands off your back and you will feel 
a force coming from behind your back. It’s like a magnet, drawing 
you backwards. Drawing you and pulling you backwards. You cannot 
stop it. Just feel it and come backwards. Let yourself go. I will catch 
you. You will not fall over. 
Leg planted. You’re ready for this, right? Let’s see what happens. I’ve had 
big guys fall on me it’s not a pleasant experience. Okay, get ready. Feel 
this.
Get ready now. When I release my hands, I want you to feel yourself 
falling backwards. When you do, just let yourself go, all the way 
back; going back, back, back, back. Okay, now.
Did you hear that thud? Oh, I felt it. Whoa. Did we get that? Okay, good. 
That’s a simple sway test backwards. Now how do you turn that into an 
induction? Simple, same way. 
When I take my hands off of your back, you will feel yourself going 
backwards. When you do, let yourself go. I will catch you. Get ready 
now. You’re beginning to come backwards now. The magnet is 
drawing you backwards. You’re coming all the way back, coming 
back, coming back all the way back. And sleep! Go all the way down. 
Loosely, limp and relaxed. 
Did you see how that works? At the same time, you’re bracing yourself. 
Wide awake. 
Applause
Thank you. You could also do it going forwards. So if I have you this way. In 
a moment, you can all practice this it’s so much fun. You little gals, be 
careful. I’ll have you little gals work with little gals. Seriously, if you’ve got a 
big guy coming down on you, it can hurt. 
Laughter
It doesn’t have to hurt though. Anyway, see that’s the power of innuendos. 
It’s not what you say, it’s what they interpret. Kind of like no, don’t even go 
there. Everything you use as part of your show just let it slide.

157
Close your eyes, down all the way. In a moment, I’m going to take 
my arms off of your shoulders. When I do, you’re going to feel 
yourself coming forward. I’m going to kind of give a little tug and 
you’re coming forward all the way, all the way, all the way. There.
Open your eyes for a second. I want to explain this. You will have some 
people, when you’re doing the sway test, for example… kind of catch 
yourself because you’re like, what the heck’s happening. 
Okay, close your eyes. You’re coming forward, coming forward, 
coming forward. Listen to me. Don’t fall. Be resistant. Trip around a 
little bit, okay? You’re coming forward because I am great at what I 
do. 
Okay, wait a minute. If you get somebody like this, here’s what’s happening. 
They’re not ready. They’re just not ready. It’s not a big deal, but for you, the 
trained competent, confident, professional stage hypnotist, this is not a 
problem. You move right through it. It’s no big deal. It’s just a situation to be 
handled. That’s all it is. Nothing fazes you, because you are professionals. 
You are the cream of the crop. Nothing, nobody is better than you. 
Feet together. 
You like that? That was pretty darn good, I have to say so. Okay, so if 
they’re resisting, it’s no big deal. 
Listen very carefully. Just let yourself fall forward. I’m going to catch 
you. Everything’s going to be fine. Just let yourself go. No big deal. 
Everything’s going to be just fine. Close your eyes, and just feel 
yourself now coming forward, coming forward, all the way forward. 
And sleep!
You can do the same thing, you see? That’s what the sway test is. There’s 
nothing more to it then that. Now, let’s say that you have, for example, 
come on up here. You’ll see this happen a lot of times in shows. Why 
people do it, I don’t know but they seem to have fun doing it. 
This is how sometimes you’ll pick out some good subjects. You’ll say who
wants to be hypnotized come on up. I’m going to break you guys up 
because I want you guys to do the sway test so that we can move forward. 
So what I was saying is that sometimes you’ll see a presentation, and you 
may even want to incorporate this into your show. I don’t know. I present 
these to you so you have options, and that’s all. 
It’s also something you can use on the street, doing a street demonstration, 
it’s fun, powerful and very effective. No big deal. So that’s what I wanted 
you guys to do. Thank you very much. Give them a round of applause and 
make them feel good.

Are you guys feeling comfortable that you are ready to give this a good go? 
When doing the sway test, is there anything that – let’s say – what are the 
limits you should place on the size differential between you and the people 
you’re working with. Like let’s say you get some guy that’s 350 pounds, he’s 
6’ 8” and you’re 5’ 6”.
That would be a little ridiculous to begin with. At some point, we have to 
think this doesn’t make sense and then just follow your instincts and go, this 
doesn’t make sense.
But, I mean in your performance, have you ever come across that situation 
where you felt I couldn’t do it on this guy? Have you seen that happen?
I’m a little cagey though. There are times when I probably shouldn’t do a lot 
of things that I do, how’s that? Does that make sense? I mean if someone’s 
really big, I probably am not going to risk that, but I don’t do the sway test in 
my shows. I show it to you for options. 
If somebody’s really big and I think that I might get hurt, I’m going to just 
say sit down and do something with him seated because I don’t want to get 
hurt. I don’t want them to get hurt and I don’t want something that I do to 
look bad and the audience is going, what are you, a fool?
We’ll take these two questions and then we’ll move through.
Yeah, the sway test was pretty good, but I have seen you do things – I don’t 
know what this is. I’ve seen people walk past you and you snap your fingers 
and they hit the floor and you didn’t catch them they just fell. So, I mean 
you’re talking about having to catch people and I’ve seen you drop them 
like a sack of potatoes. 
I’ve also seen you, which they recommend we don’t, is put a person across 
two chairs.
The human bridge? Yeah, I’ll get into that and talk about that later.
I don’t know whether that’s going to be something that we’d want to do as 
hypnotists or is that something only you can do or what?
I will talk about that tomorrow. I’ll talk about the human bridge – the ins and 
outs and the do’s and don’ts. 

159
As far as somebody just dropping down like a sack of potatoes, I told you 
I’m a little cagey. I go the extra distance, but I do it because I know the 
person is not going to get hurt. That comes with experience. Listen, it’s like 
this. If you’re in a car accident and you’re all tensed up, you’re going to get 
hurt more than somebody who’s totally relaxed.   
So if a person’s walking by me and I say sleep and they’re going down on 
the floor, number one, I’m right there next to them watching where they’re 
going to fall and I’ve already predetermined, prejudged and I’ve already run 
the whole scenario in my mind exactly how they’re going to fall. That’s how 
my mind goes ahead of this thing, it’s like playing chess. 
I look at the stage show, with me it’s like playing a game of chess. I’m 
always 10 moves ahead of everybody else. I know where they’re going to 
land. So if I think they’re going to land inappropriately, I’m going to be there 
to catch them or I’ll have an assistant there. I’ll say, get ready. Boom! And 
take them down. Does that help?   
Women with high heels, do you have to make them take their shoes off, I 
mean for the sway test, do the shoes impede that?
You know what probably not, but could you? That’s a personal call on your 
own. Really it is. Listen, I can’t even count how many shows I’ve done, and 
I’ve never had a problem with a woman wearing high heels. But there 
again, I’m saying I don’t do the sway test. Would I take her shoes off, 
maybe I would just because of the spikey little things that she may have on. 
It could break her ankle and I wouldn’t want to take that risk. 
It goes back to always watch the person. Take care of your participants. 
Their welfare is number one.
How come you don’t do the sway test?
I don’t know. I have things that I do for my own that I really enjoy doing. 
There are other’s that really enjoy doing the sway test. I think what you’ll 
discover as you continue to learn more about stage hypnosis and begin to 
practice it, is you’ll find routines that you like to do for yourself, which are 
the ones that you’ll want to do, the ones that you’re comfortable with. That’s 
all.
I’ve tried all of it to see if I liked it. It didn’t really fit with my personality, the 
way that I want to present a show, but other people do it, they do it very well 
and I think it looks pretty cool. It’s just not my deal.
With that said, everybody stand up. Move all those chairs to the side again 
and let’s get these lines going. That way, I can see what you’re doing and 
see if there’s something going down that I need to take care of, let me be 
able to do that.

Okay folks, who’s feeling a little lethargic after that long day and the meal 
and everything else? Here’s what I’m going to do. Number one, remember, 
this is the last hour or so of training tonight. This is the time where you 
really make it or break it as a hypnotist. This is the time to really push for it. 
It’s only an hour and you’ll have a lot of time. Two people here with groups 
behind. Two over here with groups behind and two over here, so we have 
six rows in total just like before. 
Row A turn your backs to Row B.
Everyone face this way. There you go.
Row B, you get to do the sway test with the person now. 
Off you go… 
You all had an opportunity to do that, correct?
Yes.
Do you all feel good about that?
Yes.
You have a new little tool, a little toy that you can play with tonight, right? 
With that said get your chairs and put them back.
Actually, no chairs because we’re about to do street hypnosis. 
Oh man, stay right where you are. Now it’s going to get ugly.

The Power of Street Hypnosis

Spencer:
Who here as heard the term – I know its crazy – street hypnosis? I know its 
nuts, isn’t it? Who here would like to do some street hypnosis, maybe 
tonight even? Walk up to a random stranger, put them in trance and do 
some cool things with them. Feel fantastic, walk off and they’re thinking, 
who the hell was that person? Wouldn’t that be something?
Can I tell a story?
Please. Do you want to come up here so the camera can actually see you 
as well? 
First off, I’d like to apologize for showing up late to class. Sorry. Secondly, 
we were at dinner tonight and Steve – where are you? Steve, I’m going to 
brag on you, only because you’re a hypno hog. You stole my thunder man, 
but that’s okay. 
The person that showed us to a table broke his tooth, so his tooth was 
broken just maybe 45 minutes ago. We were talking to him and he goes, 
I’m in pain. I’m terrible. He goes, I apologize what do you guys do? I said 
well, we’re hypnotherapists. We here learning to do street hypnosis and 
actually do stage performance. He goes, you guys are hypnotists? Boom! 
Yeah, he wanted it.
So we were sitting down and he’s like, I’ve got this toothache. Then Steve 
comes over, grabs his hand and goes, I’m going to make the pain go away 
for you. He uses the scale pain. Has anyone ever seen this done, where 
they take it and they scale the pain up and down. 
He took the guy’s pain – not completely away – but took it to the level 
where he could actually tolerate it. He was talking differently. He was 
actually feeling good. He came back. Four waitresses were coming up to us 
and then they thought we were what? Psychics. Then they thought we were 
psychics. No, we’re hypnotists.
So there are about six or seven people coming from the hotel staff up here 
that are coming down here to the Sunday show. They’re bringing their 
guests and everything else like that so, kudos to you, Steve.
Applause
Very good.

Two-Minute Street Hypnosis

Now folks, just so you realize there is nothing that these guys are doing that 
you can’t do already. This is after one day of training. I’d like to prove that to 
you would that be fair? Yes? 
I want you to just mill around like this is a public gathering. I’d like you to 
just find for the moment, just one person and just go up to them like you did 
this morning and say very congruently, hi, I’m a hypnotist. 
Then I want you to say something nice – like, you look like you’re having 
fun here – just as a way of a little chit-chat. Can I show you something 
cool? Yeah? Put your hands out like this. Where am I going?
Suggestion test.
You know these things already. These are easy, aren’t they? Can you walk 
up to a person, a pretend stranger in this room and say hi, I’m a hypnotist? 
Is that hard? Can you say something like a vaguely pleasant, sort of chatty 
thing, which is maybe a throwaway line to allow you to say something, like 
let me show you something cool. Is that easy to do?
In fact, if you want to go hardcore, you don’t even do the chit-chat. You go 
hi, I’m a hypnotist, can I show you something cool? Put your hands out like 
this. It’s crazy, I know, isn’t it? It gets better.
I want you to do is go around the room, introduce yourself as a hypnotist 
and ask if you might show them something. You can phrase it anyway you 
want – can I show you something cool? Here’s a cool trick on the power of 
the mind. Would you like to use your mind in a better way? Whatever way 
you going to phrase it, I really don’t care. Experiment, other people will 
experiment with you and you’ll find phrasing that works for you.
All you do is:
1. Suggestion test.
2. Take that straight into a conversion to an instant induction.
3. Once they’re there, fractionate it once or twice. 
4. Do a little stiff arm thing on top of that.
So you’ve done a whole little mini-skit and you’re done. This should be a no 
brainer for you guys by this stage. It’s just everything you’ve been doing 
today put together into one little two-minute package. This does not take 
more than two minutes. If you’re here 15 minutes later going and now the 
arm is getting stiff and… that’s really the wrong kind of hypnosis. 

163
I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that style of hypnosis. It has its 
place, but it’s not on the street. Does that make sense?
Yes.
You should be able to do the whole routine, fractionation, a quick demo – I 
call them street demos just because it’s not a test and that way people can’t 
fail them. Do the street demo, fractionation and one extra little thing to wow 
them away. It’s very easy to do. Two minutes, bam-bam you’re through. 
Come back and then if you’re good, we’ll show you something really cool. 
Would you like that?
Yes.
Off you go. Let’s see some energy.

Are you all enjoying this?
Yes.
What we’re going to do now is we’re going to start building this into a full 
blown street hypnosis routine. Why? Because why not? How many of you 
are planning to go out tonight and maybe trying this stuff out? Get together 
and you know what, even if you don’t want to do it, just hang out with these 
guys and watch them just because its fun and you never know, you may get 
inspired and have a go as well. 
I strongly recommend you go out and just put that extra mile in, even if it’s 
just an extra hour or so just to do it. Isn’t it inspiring, isn’t it fun for those of 
you who have done it already? This will show you that the difference 
between here and out there is small to none. In fact, usually out there you 
get better responses because people are just blown away by it, they don’t 
even know what’s going on.
What I’d like to do now is prepare you for that moment a little bit more in 
terms of what you’re looking for and in terms of looking at the dynamic. I 
know you’ve done a lot of stuff with Spencer about the dynamic of stage 
and of what’s going on inside people’s minds and so on. We want to apply 
that to a street hypnosis session would that be useful?
Yes.
The very first thing you do is, we’re going to just look at the mechanics of a 
session, and then we’re going to look at the dynamics separately.  
The first thing you’re looking for – and one and two really are the same 
thing – is you’ve got to test their attitude. If you go up to a group of people 
and go hi guys and they go, what do you want? Is that a good group to be 
doing streets demos with? You go, actually nothing.
Laughter
Why work so hard? I remember when I first started doing it years ago it was 
really a lot of awful stuff, nothing like you are capable of right now. I was 
terrified and I thought I had to make it work with everyone. Now it’s like, you 
know what I don’t want it do it with you, don’t worry about it I’ll go with these 
guys here. 

165
So find people that you might think are fun. If they look like they’re having 
fun, just go up and say hey guys, you look like you’re having fun I’m a 
hypnotist. Can I show you something cool? What we’ve just done here is 
very important. It’s a little throwaway line. 
We start to feed their attitude by giving them a reason to take part. You look 
like you’re fun. You look like you’re smart. What is the implication here, that 
what we’re about to do is going to be fun or what we’re going to be doing 
here is for smart people? Is that going to create a cooperation frame 
between you and them or a competition, like I’ll show you Mr. Hypnotist 
Man that you don’t have power over me? Which is it?
Cooperation.
So the one thing you do not want to do is create this thing like hey, I’m 
Hypno-Man, yeah! Try and resist me now and I will hypnotize you to do 
stupid things and you can’t stop me! You can try that out tonight if you want. 
Laughter
You won’t get a refund if you do all right. The attitude that they present to 
you when you start the whole interaction off, that is the key. It tells you 
whether, or not you even want to continue in the first place. 
Part of the attitude then comes with compliance. Will they do what you ask? 
Can you stand over here a second, just stand over there. You want to play 
with the whole group. Let me re-emphasize this. One of the biggest 
mistakes you can make is switch to one person ignoring the rest of the 
group, because the group dynamic is not in your favor. You want the group 
with you, even if you’re not working with the whole group. Does that make 
sense?
You want everyone being fascinated. Just say, just move around here. 
Don’t worry, if you’re scared that’s fine, just watch you’ll enjoy this. You, 
you’re going to be good. So you’re involving people so that they don’t start 
messing with the dynamic of what’s going on there. Does that make sense?
How do we do it? We test for compliance. Even people who aren’t 
necessarily volunteering for your demos, you’ll still get them to comply by 
saying you just stand over here and over there. Give them a little bit of 
space, they’ll be fine. If they’re not compliant, what do you do? You say you 
know what guys, its okay we’ll go somewhere else and do something 
different. At least you can talk about it or something like that, but you don’t 
want to start any kind of demo if the dynamic is not in your favor. Does that 
make sense to everyone?
Student:

This is one of the biggest mistakes I see people do. Usually this happens at 
parties. Someone says go on then, hypnotize me, and people go, all right. 
You’re already going to lose at that point, aren’t you? It doesn’t mean you 
can’t do it, but if you know about these two things, then you’re going to look 
for the attitude to be in place before you actually begin anything that is more 
hypnotic. 
You could actually say okay, I just want to see if you can actually 
concentrate properly first. So you put a challenge on saying can you keep 
up rather than, can you fight me? Then you do the whole compliance thing, 
like move them around, move them up a little bit. You can do a classic 
suggestion demo at that point – a street demo, but now it’s a test of 
concentration, rather than a test of can I make the Hypnotist Man fail. Do 
you see how we doing this so far? 
Next, we’re looking for attention and focus. We’re looking for the people 
who are most attentive and most focused on whom?
You.
No, me. Exactly! You are the hypnotist. That means you are the center of 
attention for that demo. It doesn’t mean that you have to be the world’s 
biggest egotist. You can be if you want to, but you don’t have to be, but 
whilst you’re doing the demo, all the energy, all the attention is flowing 
through you. You’re the channel that everything’s going through. Does that 
make sense?
If you’re not again, you risk things slipping off one way or another. So you’re 
looking for attention. This is where the demos are perfect. These street 
demos we’ve been playing with – the hands, the sway, the finger vice, the 
finger lock, all that sort of stuff – are perfect because it allows you to test for 
people’s focus. 
You’ll see some people there and they’re going, whoa. You’ve seen this 
happen once or twice today, right? You’ll see some people going like this. 
Which of the two are you going to select? 
The first one.
Exactly. So these demos are called suggestibility tests, not to see whether, 
or not someone will be hypnotizable or pass or fail. It’s just for you to know 
who the heck you’re going to work with. That’s it! So the two things you’re 
looking for are:
1. Speed of response. 
Students:
Igor:
Students:
Igor:

167
How quickly are they responding? If you say in a moment, you’ll feel 
magnets pull those hands together, boom, that’s probably a good person to 
work with. The other thing you’re looking for is, I’ll use the words…
2. Emersion of experience.
They get absorbed by the experience. It’s not just focus. Focus in part of it, 
but this is a bigger thing with the whole reality. You can see it kind of 
happening, where nothing else exists except for those hands, and they’re 
so there. Does that make sense?
You’re looking for these two things, in terms of who you’re going to select. 
Finally, once you’ve don’t the demo and you’ve had a successful result with 
at least once person in that group, and you’ve seen elements of speed and 
emersion in terms of their response, well, as far as I’m concerned, you’re 
home free. You can do anything at that point, really, within ethical limits.
Don’t come crying to me if you get arrested for, I don’t know, making 
someone into a pygmy monkey for the rest of his life. Who knows? Just 
keep it fun, keep it lighthearted and we’ll show you some cool things to do 
with that. But really, at that point, you can do whatever you want – instant 
inductions, fractionations or more demos. You can do all the class things –
sticking people around the place, that’s always a fun favorite for people. 
Even the whole routines, everything we’ll be doing tomorrow. All those 
things will be possible at that point because you’ve just opened the door 
with all this. Does that kind of make sense?
There is one last thing I’d like you to keep in mind which is what do you do if 
things go wrong, if they don’t work out any ideas? 
Run! You bring them out and tell them – it’s the same as an abreaction, 
right?
Okay, I actually don’t mean an abreaction. I mean like you say, you can’t 
bend your arm and they go like this, that sort of thing.
Okay, well, in that case, you would just go to something else and keep 
trying different tests.
Here’s the simple rule. If it doesn’t work, do an instant induction, deepen, 
fractionate and do it again. I have actually done this, we did this, remember 
the guy in Missoula? Even this thing here just wasn’t working too well. It 
was like, oh bugger. 
So what happens? You put him in and you do it again and again, and you 
fractionate it and fractionate it. After about 10 minutes, he’s like this. I say 
Student:
Igor:
Student:
Igor:

168
your arm is stiff and he’s going, I don’t care about my arm. I don’t even 
know who I am anymore.
Laughter
So just fractionate, fractionate, fractionate and eventually, you’ll get it. It 
may not even hold for that long if the person at that point is not 
concentrating properly or whatever it is. It’s not a big deal. It will hold long 
enough to be impressive and then you do what you suggested; run!
Really, you can’t go wrong because aren’t instant inductions easy? So just 
think in the back of your mind, wash, rise, repeat. If it hasn’t worked out, 
don’t panic. Instant induction – that’s the wash; the rinsing bit is deepening; 
repeat is you try it again. Simple, isn’t it? 
That gives you a little package for street hypnosis, which is easy, it’s 
simple, it’s robust and it will pretty much work anywhere you go. Seem 
cool?

Important Group Dynamics
Igor:
What I want you to do now is get into groups of three or four people. We’re 
going to give you a little bit longer because each one’s going to have a go 
at this. Can I actually borrow four people up here on stage just so I can 
show you? Just come on up.
Now the group or whoever you’re working with, I want you to pretend like 
these guys are at a bar, they’re just chatting to know each other. All you’re 
going to do is go in and just say hey guys, what’s up? My name is Igor. I’m 
a hypnotist. You guys look like you’re having a great time. Can I just show 
you something really cool about the power of the mind. Would that be cool? 
Just put your hands out like this. 
Where am I? We’ve just done exactly all we’ve been looking at here. All I’m 
doing now is working with a slightly larger group, so it feels like a little bit 
more trepidation. It’s like oh, they’re having a conversation and what if I 
interrupt? 
Look at them. They’re still there. Now you can relax. But you’re doing the 
same things. Hi, introduce yourself, I’m a hypnotist, so they know why 
you’re there. Let me show you something cool. You may even get ask their 
permission. Would it be okay if I show you something cool about the power 
of the mind, yes? Okay, put your hands like this. Thank you and just relax. 
Is that easy? So we’re going to do exactly the same thing you just did a 
moment ago, only this time we’re going to work the group dynamic and 
you’re going to be looking at those five steps.
In other words, whose got the best attitude whilst you’re doing the 
suggestion thing or whatever, who is really responding most dramatically. 
You just watch. If you’re not sure, you know what you do? Do another one, 
seriously. 
If you’re not sure – let’s say you’re doing this one and they’re all kind of 
responding okay. So you’re not sure who you’re going to choose, so you 
say okay, this time put your hands out like this. Now there are magnets 
coming closer, closer, closer. One goes like this and one’s still like this a 
half an hour later. So if you’re not sure, you just do something else. Does 
that make sense to you all? 
I want you all to get a chance to experience what it feels like to walk in on a 
group of people with a big smile on your face saying hey guys, I’m a 
hypnotist. Can I show you something cool? Simple as that. Then go straight 
into your routine. Choose one person from the group. You can choose 

170
several, but for now just choose one person in the group. You’ll do exactly 
what you did, only this time – let’s say we choose Jimmy over here – this 
time we off of the group. 
And sleep. All the way, deeper, deeper. That’s right, all the way. 
There you go. 
Now you’re going to play up to the group. 
On balance, on your own feet that’s it, nice and deep. 
Now you can play it up to the group.
Watch this, guys. Do you want to see something cool? Just stand 
back a second because this might hurt you. You’ll be nice and strong 
with this. Make it strong. Stiff and rigid, stiff and rigid, like an iron bar, 
stiff and rigid, no matter how hard you try to move it, you cannot 
bend it. No one can bend it. Try to bend that arm and notice how stiff 
and rigid it is. 
Go ahead and touch it. That’s pretty intense, isn’t it? That’s a hypno-
arm there. And relax. All the way down. All the way down. See, I 
have special hypno-powers and deeper still. Okay, wide awake. 
Eyes open. Good job. Well done, you. How do you feel about that?
So do you see how we’re playing it up for the group a little bit as well, maybe 
even have a little bit of fun with it? So you’re still involving them, you’ve just 
chosen the one person to have a little bit of fun interaction with. Easy? Give 
these guys a round of applause. Thanks, folks.

How are you all doing? Good? Oh, come on, it’s the last 20 minutes. How 
are you doing?
Great!
Now I feel you. Did you enjoy that exercise?
Yes.
Can you see yourself using it in real life? I mean pretty much every piece is 
there. Here’s a hint. When you’re doing this and you want to get a good 
result, like to warm the group up, you do something like the finger vice. It’s 
pretty much a no brainer, most people will “pass it” and do well. 
Then, if you want to actually select someone, do something like this or the 
hand clasp or something like that. Why? Because you’re now looking for 
people who could be more hyper-responsive so you can do more advanced 
and crazy stuff with them. Does that make sense?
Just play the range between you. You have plenty of tools, plenty of demos 
you can do. Just mix it up and have fun with it. You can bounce from table 
to table, from venue to venue and have a lot of fun with this, would that be 
fair to say?
Now, wouldn’t it be good if we were doing all these things to have a good 
kick ass thing you can do at the end. I apologize for my language. It’s 
French. I’m European. I can’t help it. But wouldn’t it be good to have a 
slightly bleeped out thing that you can finish off as a great big finale, rather 
than just saying, there you go that was the demo, well done, yay. Wouldn’t 
that be nice to have?
Yes.
Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to have a little piece, which is 
simple. In fact, can I have a volunteer please, someone who wants to feel 
great. Come on up. May I borrow your glasses they’ll be safe? 
You won’t be able to see through them.
That’s all right. I have my own. They’re like mine now, aren’t they? Are you 
ready for this?

172
And sleep, all the way, deeper, deeper, deeper that’s right. Now find 
your own balance. That’s it, going deeper and deeper still as you find 
your own balance, on your own legs, very good. Excellent! This hand 
now is stiff and rigid. Just as before, make a fist, stiff and rigid, stiff 
and rigid. Make a fist with that hand. Make a fist. Make it strong, 
stronger and stronger. 
The stronger it gets, the better you feel. The strongest this gets, the 
better you feel. The stronger this gets, the better you feel. That’s 
right. Stiff and rigid so that you can’t bend it and no one can bend 
this. As that happens, try to bend it. Try to bend it now. And relax it. 
Keep it stiff and rigid for now. 
As the arm relaxes, the fist will get tense because inside the fist, I 
want you to put a memory, a memory of something wonderful and 
charming from your past. Something you may have forgotten about. 
Something you may not have thought of in years. Feel that memory 
inside that fist, traveling up the arm into your shoulder, into your body 
and re-experience that now. Remember how good it felt. Can you do 
that now?
That’s right. Feel that memory growing stronger and stronger. Every 
time you squeeze that fist, that memory becomes stronger. Squeeze 
that fist and it becomes stronger. Squeeze that fist and it becomes 
stronger until you are positively glowing with a light. That face of 
yours will start lighting up. You might have a smile on your face. 
You’ll have this feel-good feeling inside of you, that’s right. 
Remember just how good it felt to have that charming memory.
Now I want you to have something important happen. Find your own 
balance. That’s right. Find your own balance. Good. Relax the arm 
and relax the wrist. Relax the fist and that memory will fade, but the 
cool thing is as soon as you squeeze that fist, those good feelings 
come flooding back, and you might not even remember the memory 
fully. Perhaps you will. Let’s find out, shall we?
Squeeze your fist and watch those feelings come back. Isn’t that 
amazing? This is something you can take with you for the rest of 
your life, anytime you need it, that fist and your will to make it so. 
You think of that fist, you think of that memory, you squeeze that fist 
and you will feel this good. Do you want to try that out now? Okay, 
relax the fist 1-2, wide awake. Open your arms. How you doing? Are 
you doing good?
That’s pretty cool, isn’t it? That’s what hypnosis can do for you. Thank you 
for sharing.

Isn’t that a charming way to leave people? So, after doing all the skits and 
the power of hypnosis, you’re actually leaving them with something that 
shows them, hey, this stuff can actually do good things. It’s a genuine force 
of good. 
I like to do little things like that as a little crescendo to it. You might too. The 
very simple thing is go on a one-to-one basis now. Find one partner and 
just have one go each, because we’re coming to the end of the night. I want 
you to select one of your little demos, whether it’s this, the hand clasp or the 
arm lock. I don’t care what it is. Once they succeed in it, I’d like you to 
attach something very positive. 
The easiest way to do this is to get them to come up with some random 
positive memory, some fun experience or happy experience from the past. 
Then bring it back to life so they can really enjoy it in the now. Simple? Add 
some fuel to the actual test working or whatever it is. I mean, sometimes 
you’ll have the energy inside their hands and that’s the energy of someone 
they truly love, and they can feel that love all over again. 
You can get as creative as you want, but the essence of it is really what we 
did today. It’s this, isn’t it? You just associate one thing to the other. Does 
that make sense to you? You’re only as constrained as your imagination is 
limited. So you may as well go beyond what you thought you could do and 
actually have fun with this.   
Are there any questions? All right, take two minutes apiece. Do that quickly. 
Come back in a positive happy glow and we’ll wrap up for the night. Off you 
go.

energy levels. You should feel bushed right now. Some of you are probably 
thinking, it’s time to go to sleep, and that’s fine. But I recommend that even 
if you are going to go to sleep, just take a half an hour and go somewhere. 
Where are you going tonight is it the MGM or something? Is that right?
Yeah.

Hands up again those of you who are going out tonight to do a little bit of 
street hypnosis. Even if you’re not actually doing it – put your hands up so 
people can see –tag along with these guys. Make sure you grab them 
outside in the corridor. If nothing else, you’re going to have blast watching 
them to stuff, right?
Who knows, maybe you’ll get inspired to do something yourself. There’s no 
pressure. It’s just whatever you feel inspired to do. So you know you have 
been working hard, right? They’ve been working hard, haven’t they?
I think they’ve been working very hard.
And that’s a good thing. 
It’s the best thing ever.
Because when you work hard…
You get good at what you do.
And you are good at what you do know, aren’t you?
And you’re getting better.
And the better you feel about your skills…
The deeper you take people into trance.
And trance is a funny thing, isn’t it?
Because it’s about exciting the imagination.
And you get excited all the way down.
And that’s where you want to go. 
In a calm place.
Inside your mind now. 
It can be great excitement.
When everything just lets go for a moment.
And you really don’t have to think.
And why would you want to…

To really learn…
To really take it in…
Grow.
Expand.
Make changes…
Easily.
Everything you’ve learned today.
And it’s so natural to you.
Stimulating your brain.
And you can take it with you.
So natural…
That you’ll take it to others…
And…
It’s a part of you…
At night when you dream.
The dream can be vivid.

They’ve worked harder than I’ve seen anybody work in a long time.
And far be it for us to suggest that they might take anything of this and 
dream about it or do anything with it, because I think they’ve worked hard 
enough, really haven’t they.
I think so I think it’s time to just play.

I think it’s time you just go out there and let the world just take you in 
whatever way it wants to, and you just follow your instincts. Wouldn’t that be 
fair to say? Rather than us telling you what to do, you may as well just go 
out and just let your instincts guide you, right.
Bring back stories. 
And video footage. I have a camera I’ll give that to you. Hold the camera 
up. Okay, not you. We’ll have someone more alive. He’s like I’m in trance I 
don’t know what I’m doing. Look after the camera whilst he’s holding it, 
would you? Just take some footage of you guys having fun, that’s all it’s 
really about. 
Who’s going to go with us in our group?
Spartans!
It’s more like a fun thing to do, guys. Enjoy yourselves. Just go out there. 
You know the principles and really this is just principles in action, right. 
Wouldn’t that be fair to say? So have a great time with it, folks. Give 
yourself a nice round of applause because you deserve it. 
Applause
Now go home. Tomorrow morning we’ll start at 9:00 on the dot, so please 
be ready to come in a little bit beforehand so that we can start getting 
everything rolled in.

Fun With Street Hypnosis
All right, here’s what we’re going to do today, we’re going to have a good 
day. How many of you went out last night and did something crazy? Wow! 
Briefly I’d like to hear what happened. Who would like to share real quick? 
Actually, a couple of us who went out, we had a crew. We went out like a 
pack of wolves. It was very interesting. We went in there and Ed was the 
shiner of the night. Where is he? He was the shiner. He was getting all 
kinds of people. 
I found this group of guys from England though, and they were all sitting at 
the table. So I was like okay, there’s my group I’m going to get them. So I 
went in there and got them. This one guy, I got him to do a finger lock. I did 
the suggestibility test and we got the finger lock. He couldn’t unlock his 
fingers. I tried to take it into an instant induction, but he was so focused on 
his fingers, that he would not go to sleep. 
So I just ran with it, I was like, okay, we’re just going to flow with it, that’s 
cool right? He did that and I broke off for a little bit, then I came back and 
got the other guy and just did the handshake induction. I gave him a bunch 
of energy and confidence and all of that.
After that, it kind of went downhill. I tried to get this other group of girls, but 
it was cool. I was remembering what you guys were saying, like we don’t 
fail; they fail because we’re the hypnotists. So they’re just not suggestible 
it’s not my fault. That’s how I was playing it off. I had a whole group of girls. 
We did the finger lock and they were supposed to…
What were you trying to do with the group of women?
Well, I was just trying to see who was more suggestible so I could get 
one…
Get them ready?
Yeah and go from there, right? So I was just practicing, getting in the habit 
of just messing with people basically, and decided I’m just going in there 
and attack a group. 
After all of their hands popped open, I played it off like, you guys just 
messed up my show. None of you are suggestible I can’t use any of you. I 

184
just played it off and they were all cracking up and everything. So I invited 
them to the show on Sunday. 
Long story short, I was two out of three. Hypnotized two, failed on three, but 
there’s never really any failures. It felt good. I was happy. I was just having 
fun. 
Awesome! Does anybody else have something they want to share? Give 
him a round of applause he did good.
Applause
Well, it was mixed revues last night actually. Bill, right out of the shoot, 
down at the bus shuttle, hypnotized a lady like boom! It was amazing. I’ve 
got it on my little video camera. I, on the other hand, didn’t do quite as well. 
It was a learning experience. So I think the first clue should have been the 
stack of empty beers that were stacked on their table. 
Two of the guys seemed to be having a good time. So I went up and said 
hey, you look like you’re having a good time. I’m a hypnotist. Can I show 
you something kind of fun and whacky? And they’re like, no!
Laughter and Applause
We had a big group and this brave one broke the ice. Oh, you have a 
picture? We went to the bar at The Wynn and there were seven of us. 
I was in Vegas many years ago and didn’t like the whole bar pit manager. 
There was a gentleman standing all by himself who looked like a pit 
manager at the bar, so that would be the last person I’d go up to. 
So he goes up to him first and says, can I show you – and he did the 
suggestibility test. He comes back with a $20 bill. He’s like, I like this. His 
beer was free. Then Kristin and I went up to three men at a table and said, 
can we show you something fun? We’re hypnotists. They were like, no!
They were gay.
Laughter
If two women came up to me and said, do you want to have some fun…
They said no! 
I wouldn’t tell them I’m a hypnotist, though.
We figured they either thought we were hookers or we were out to get their 
money. So I decided, okay, I will not be beat. I went and looked for a table

of women and there were three young waitress girls. I have daughters, so I 
knew I could get there. 
So I went up and two of them were like, we don’t want you to read our 
minds. I said I’m not a psychic; I’m a hypnotist. People don’t know. Then 
they said we’re not paying you. I said we don’t want any money. Not even a 
tip. We don’t want any money. That was what I think the essence of what 
maybe those men thought too. So we did a suggestibility test and the one 
that was the best at it was scared to death to be hypnotized. 
And she was what, the best one?
The most suggestible. 
Did you hear that? You’re going to run into this often. You’re going to find 
that the person who has the greatest fear is usually the person who’s the 
mostly highly responsive.
Because they know.
So for you, when you hear that, you should be going ping! A light goes on 
and you’re going, all right this is going to be a good one. 
I think we pretty much figured all three of them would. The second one was 
like, I’ll do it. So I asked her what she would like to improve in your life. She 
said relationships. 
I went and sat next to her and I did the just fell on my shoulder, I brought 
her up, fell on my shoulder. I looked up and all seven people were crowded 
around the table. My group, my homies were all there. So I did an in-and-
out several times and then stiff arm and her friends were taking pictures. 
They couldn’t believe it. 
Then I gave her the suggestions of relationship in the pit of her stomach, 
and she can get good guys now, get rid of the bad guys and all kinds of 
stuff. I pulled all kinds of stuff out of the air. Then the guys took over and…
Good. Did you guys hear what she just said?  
I pulled a lot of stuff out of the air.
Out of the air. Yeah. The stage hypnotist, the professional stage hypnotist 
pulls things out of the air. They are the master of improv. They take a 
situation and they make it work. Go ahead.
Then, he came in and grabbed the one girl who was like, oh no, I can’t. She 
was a little crazy and he had her drinking fake drinks. Who else? Yeah, he 
took the one that was scared to death and he ended up putting her under

so all three of the girls, we just had fun, and then the guy that he started 
with asked us not to do this anymore and to please stop, so the night ended 
with that.
Very cool. Good for you. Pass that back behind you, please.
Applause
Hi. First, I just wanted to thank you and Igor because when I got home 
yesterday, I wanted to go with the guys, but my wife, who’s over in the hotel 
phoned me up and said, you need to get back, I’ve got some news for you. 
Before I came over, I went to my local Miner’s Club – Coal Miner’s Club, 
and said I’m a hypnotist and I’m looking for work. They confirmed last night, 
and I’ve got my first job as soon as I return in two weeks.
Applause
Right on.
That’s the first confirmed one. The second one is not confirmed until I get 
my proof that I’m working in Vegas at the moment. 
Laughter
And I’m going to get a couple of old service buddies back home – it’s the 
first job I’m going to have had in five years since my accident. I’ve been 
unable to work, I lost my job with the Army through this accident, so I’m 
going to be entertaining the guys before they go over to Afghanistan as well 
in a month’s time on production of the video, of course.
Excellent!
Then last night we went to dinner – myself and the wife. The drinks waitress 
came over at the Mirage and she looked really miserable. I said you look 
awful. I still had the badge on and she asked, what do you do? I’m a 
hypnotist. Oh. I said can I do something for you? I said you look really 
awful. Well yeah, I suppose it wasn’t the usual what I was expecting, no, 
have a nice day. 
She looked really miserable. I did the suggestibility test, stuck her hands 
together and I told her it was funny and getting funnier and funnier. The 
more she tried to release it the funnier it would get. I said that feeling you’ve 
got right now, that’s going to stay with you for the rest of the evening. And 
for the rest of the evening, she had this big grin on her face. She just 
couldn’t stop grinning. It was fantastic. 
Far out. Thank you so much.

The Preshow
When you’re doing a show, professional stage hypnotists, you always have 
a crew to help out. What’s your job, hypnotist? Your job is to do your job. 
There’s a whole business to show business besides just doing your show, 
but you need to focus on what you’re doing in your show. 
So you have people that help you to move things around to make your 
show possible. The hypnotist always makes sure the chairs are together, at 
least I do. I never use chairs that have arms in them, that way people won’t 
be able to fall on top of each other. You want them to fall on top of each 
other because it looks good.
Let me run you through briefly what it’s like to do a show. This is kind of like 
a preshow routine that happens. Let’s just imagine for a second that you’re 
the audience. You’ve come here. You’ve paid the big bucks to see the 
show. You’ve paid $100 a ticket to come to see my show, which you should 
enjoy doing, right.  
Oh yeah. Yes.
Good. No discounts for those of you who aren’t speaking up. Anyway, 
we’ve got our DJ. I want to run through this real quickly to show you what 
it’s like and then we’re going to break up and do this in little groups. Then 
I’m going to show you how I do it with a large group and then we’re going to 
break up into small groups and you’re going to have the opportunity to do 
that with yourselves.
If I could have number three please.  
You can use a microphone, a headset or a lapel mic, my preference is to 
use a headset. That way my hands are free, but a microphone looks cool in 
your hand, so I always have another microphone over here because I can 
take it from here and when I’m talking to my subjects up here, I can still 
speak without having to go back and forth. 
With the intro – there are different parts to the show. In the preshow, you 
have the audience that comes in, the music is that people entering hear, 
they’re sitting down and waiting for the show to begin.  
So when you’re doing a show, you’re always getting ready. Before the show 
begins, you go half a day early and you run through the entire routine. You 
make sure everything is tight. You work with your DJ to make sure your 
sound is working. You make sure everything is happening. 
Students:
Spencer:

189
You go through every single routine in your mind, and you do it with the DJ 
to make sure that you guys are both on the same page. It’s very important 
because you want the show to be flawless. Even during a show, you may 
have something that comes off incorrectly, and you just make that part of 
your show. It’s kind of like yeah, bring that music down just a little bit that 
would be cool. 
Then you just go on with your show and just make it a part of it because no 
matter how good you are or your DJ, there will be times when things just 
happen, just manage it and just make it a part of your show.
So the audience is coming into the show. They’ve seen all the promotions, 
they’ve seen your website and they’ve seen the posters. They’ve seen 
everything happening. They paid the money and they’re sitting in here. You, 
the professional stage hypnotist, are off stage in the back room, which is 
usually called The Green Room in a professional theater. If it’s in a 
professional bar it’s called The Bathroom.
Laughter
Or The Kitchen if it’s in a restaurant. All venues are different. I prefer 
venues that have a Green Room, one of those little places where you go 
and they have a nice big room back there with a sofa. They’ve got a wet 
bar. They’ve got an ironing board so you can take your clothes in there and 
make sure they’re all nicely pressed before you do your show.
They’ve got these big mirrors there with lights on them so you can look at 
yourself. And ladies, you can do your face up; and guys, you can do your 
hair and your face or whatever it is that you need to do. Make sure your 
clothes look good and you’re ready. You can brush your teeth, spray and 
everything so you don’t go out there and talk to people with bad breath and 
stink and things are out of order.
This is all stuff that happens in the preshow for you guys, as a professional 
hypnotist. Now whether it’s in a big theater or whether it’s at the Elk’s 
Lodge. It doesn’t really matter. It’s the same thing because all eyes are 
going to be on you.
So, the audience is there and we’re gathered to see the hypnotist come. 
Now in a big theater, you want to be off stage. You don’t want to be seen 
before the show. You just don’t want to be. It’s not what you do. You want 
to be mysterious. You want to magically appear when they call out your 
name.
Now, if you’re at the Elk’s Lodge, the Moose Lodge, the Lion’s Club or your
local bar or something like that, no big deal you’re probably going to be 
sitting there having a cocktail with somebody anyway. 
[
]

190
Then when it’s time for you to do your show, you just get up there and do it 
and everybody’s half looped anyway, so it doesn’t really matter. You’re just 
there to have a good time. However, when you get on the big stage, 
everything changes. You’ve got to be the guy that is not seen until the show 
begins. 
So here we are in Las Vegas. I’m going to go down here to The Green 
Room for just a second. Good Green Rooms always have a TV monitor, 
which is cool because you can watch people coming into the theater, you 
can see where they’re sitting and get a look at their eyes and their face. 
It’s kind of fun to see people coming in and bee-bopping around. You’ve got 
music playing in the background because you’re setting a stage. So in my 
shows, what I do is I always set the stage. I’ll let people in about 30 minutes 
early, and I’ll have music that I’ve put together playing. It’s music that I’ve 
created myself. You can use music that you enjoy whatever you want to 
use. 
I’ve created my own music for my own show that’s kind of mysterious and 
fun and funky. I have this eclectic blend of stuff and people are going, what 
the hell is that? Because what I want to do is put people in a different stage 
of consciousness. I don’t want to give them anything that’s too familiar. 
I like to give people something that’s different because it takes them out of 
their world of reality and they have to think wow, where are we going with 
this? What is this? This is different. So I’m already creating this trance state 
with people right away with my music that’s part of the preshow. Does that 
make sense?
Yes.
You can use whatever you want. If it’s in a country bar, I’ll play Garth 
Brooks or something because everybody can relate to that. There’s a 
difference between working in a bar situation and working in a theater 
where it’s a show that you’ve promote or have been hired to do, and they’re
paying you $10,000 or $20,000 or $50,000 to go do. Whole different level, 
but do them all because they’re all fun to do.
My preference now is working large theaters, but I’ll tell you what I’ll go to a 
bar any day of the week, if I’m paid to go and if they charge people at the 
door. If you accept a job – and we’ll talk more about this in the business –
where they just hire you to come into a nightclub just to perform, chances 
are you’re going to have a poor show. Why? Because you’re not a 
destination. 
Students:
Spencer:

191
Your show better be a destination. If you want the best volunteers, the best 
subjects, the best show and the best audience participation, you need to be 
a destination. You don’t need to be the sideshow, where people are coming 
in – well, we’re going to go get drunk anyway. Let’s go where they have a 
hypnotist. Let’s go and check it out. No big deal. We’re still going to party. 
You’re not the main attraction.
So, when you get into the professional realm, no matter where you perform, 
make sure that it’s paid, that people pay to come to see you and you’ll 
greater success then anything.
Now, back to the preshow – we talked about that and that’s part of the 
preshow too– you’ve got your posters up and so you’re back here in your 
Green Room. Then you have the announcer and he goes, ladies and 
gentlemen, please do me a favor – and you’re back there going oh shit, 
there it goes. Maybe you have some butterflies going. You’ve got to go to 
the bathroom one last time. Take a drink of water. Get ready for this, if 
you’re the nervous type. 
Or, you can anchor yourself to a very exciting state. This is what I do. I 
simply, as soon as I get up on stage, I have the microphone. Or as soon as 
I get up on stage if I don’t have a mic, if I just have the hand held. As soon 
as I walk out there, I go into a whole different persona. It’s the stage 
hypnotist persona. 
If I have this, I just anchor to a state where I become just the entertainer, 
nothing else matters, nothing else exists but this. It’s just about what I can 
do for these people. Does that make sense?
That’s what I want you to do. In your preshow, when you get ready, you 
become the hypnotist. You’re nothing else. You’re no longer who you are. 
You become that. You become that person, that individual, that persona, 
that psyche. You become the entertainer.
When you get off stage, you’re just the same old guy that you were before 
you went out to the stage – or the same lady. But, when you’re on stage 
people are looking, so you have that buzz.
So I anchor myself to the state. You can find any kind of positive stage, and 
I’ll show you how to do that here in a little bit. How to anchor yourself to a 
very positive, upbeat, powerful state so that when you get up there on 
stage, you’re there, you’re ready and you’re not going to have butterflies.

192
Step 1: Your Introduction
So anyway, you have the announcement. They say ladies and gentlemen, 
please do me a favor and give Spencer a powerful round of applause and 
the audience claps.
Applause
All right, how are you guys doing out there? Are you guys having a good 
time so far?
Yes!
Are you guys ready to be hypnotized?
Yes!
All right. Let me ask, before I even begin, how many people in here have 
been hypnotized before? Raise your hands. Oh, this is going to be a good 
night for sure. Let me ask you, if you have not been hypnotized, raise your 
hands. Wow! One person has not been hypnotized. Wow. Okay, very cool.
Well, before I begin, let me tell you a little bit about what hypnosis is so that 
when you get ready to come up here and enjoy yourself, you’re going to 
already know what’s happening. 
Listen to the words that I’m using. I’m telling people what to expect. Part of 
what I’m doing is building this mental expectancy with people so that when 
they come up here, my job is already done out here in the audience. My job 
is done. I’ve done it. I’m ready. We’re ready to rock and roll. 
How many of you have been hypnotized? And you raise your hands. What 
am I doing right away? 
Getting compliance.
I am getting compliance. I’m getting those yeses. I want to know if you’ve 
been hypnotized, raise your hands. If you have not been hypnotized, raise 
your hands. I’m getting everybody to follow along with these waking 
suggestions left and right. Nobody’s going to escape from the hypnotist. 
I want everybody out there – there is no wrong way to do it and there is no 
wrong answer. I’m going to get the hands going up one way or another. If 
I’m in a place where I see somebody who’s not doing anything and just kind

of looking at me – you’ll have that. People looking at you like, what’s your 
deal, buddy?
For example, you’re like, what’s the matter man didn’t you have a good 
night last night? Did your wife kick you out of the house? You’re not here to 
have fun? What’s happening with you? So you can throw little one-liners in 
there and just have fun with people. They may look at you and you go wow, 
you’re one that’s pretty cool. Well, we’re still going to have a good time.
You’ll run into this every once in awhile, not very often, but there’s always 
somebody out there that wants to one-up you, the hypnotist, on the stage; 
not always, but it can happen. So I bring this out to you in the preshow 
because it can happen. Just notice and observe people because what you 
want to do is get people coming your way. 
We talked a little bit about that yesterday. You want them in the palm of 
your hand. I want everybody right here so that I can mold them. I want them 
right there so I can squeeze them a little bit. I want to take their little brains, 
and squish them together. I want them to do what I want them to do. It 
doesn’t always work, but we give it our best shot.
So at this point, you understand where I’m going so far, right?
Yes.
All right. From there, I’m going well, I’ll tell you what. Let me tell you a little 
bit about hypnosis before we even begin, because I know that some of you 
out there think that you haven’t been hypnotized, so let me tell you what it’s 
like. Have you driven in a car and you’ve gone from your house to the store 
or to work. Yes?
Yes.
Everybody’s done that. How many times have you been driving and you just 
kind of like got there? You just happened to get there and its like, how did I 
get here? Or you passed your house and you’re going, oh shoot. How many 
of you have done that? Yeah. Everybody’s done that that’s called highway 
hypnosis, somehow you just got there. 
I’ll tell you, I do that every time I get on a plane and fly overseas. You get on 
a flight and it takes you 12 or 20 hours and it’s a long flight, how did you get 
there? It’s a plane trance it’s weird, especially when you go over 10 or 12 
time zones. It’s crazy.
All the sudden, your whole world is upside down. But let me tell you another 
time when you’ve been hypnotized. How about when you watch a movie? 
How many of you have been to a big movie theater? Raise your hands. 
Very cool. 
Students:
Spencer:
Students:
Spencer:

194
You know, you’re sitting there, you’re watching the big screen and you see 
the characters. You laugh and you cry, you become amused, amazed, 
whatever, but you become involved in the characters. That’s what the 
movie is for. The actors are up there to create a sense inside of you, a 
feeling so when you identify with that feeling, you have been hypnotized. 
That’s based on suggestion. 
Let me tell you another time. How about when you read a book? How many 
times have you read a book and you said I’m going to sit down and read 
this book for a few minutes and then all the sudden, you became so 
engrossed in it that hours passed? The book was over. It’s like, wow! How 
many of you have done that? That’s a hypnotic state of mind.
Now for those of you who haven’t raised your hands because you can’t 
identify, let me ask you this. How many times have you said to yourself, I 
am so tired I just need five minutes? Then you go find a chair. You say I’m 
just going to take five minutes. I’m going to close my eyes and after five 
minutes, I’ll open my eyes and I’m going to feel great. I just need these five 
minutes.
So you sit down, you take that five minutes and then all the sudden 
magically, for some reason, five minutes pass, you open your eyes and you 
feel wonderful. How many of you have done that? You have hypnotized 
yourself. You have given yourself a self hypnotic suggestion.   
So everybody has been hypnotized. Everybody has been and everybody 
will be tonight. I want you to enjoy what we’re going to do for you. 

195
Step 2: Get Volunteers
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
So here’s what I’m going to do. Let’s do a group thing, everybody sit back in 
your chairs. Put your feet flat on the floor. Take your hands – give me a 
volunteer up here. Come on up here. You’re a good volunteer. How do you 
pronounce your name?
Yuichi.
Okay, everybody do what Yuichi does. Take your hands and put 
them above your head. Palms together and interlock your fingers. 
Arms up high. Squeeze your hands together as tightly as you can. 
Now watch what I’m doing. I’m making sure those arms are up there stiff 
and rigid, right? I am the confident, competent, professional stage hypnotist. 
I don’t care who I pick out of the audience. I don’t care who wants to 
volunteer. There is a risk in this for you, but you can do this. 
Squeeze your hands together as tightly as you can. Close your eyes 
down all the way. I want you to close your eyes down all the way, 
and I want you to imagine that your hands are locked. They are 
glued and they will not come apart. Squeeze them together tighter 
and tighter, and make sure those hands are locked. They are glued.
Your fingers are stuck against the back of your hands. Your palms 
stick tighter and tighter. 
Your arms are stiff and rigid and powerful. They will not bend. Your 
hands are locked together. They will not pull apart. You can try to 
pull them apart, but they stick tighter and tighter. Try hard to pull your 
hands apart. They’re stuck tight. They will not come apart. Try hard, 
but they stick tighter and tighter.   
Very good, open your eyes and just look around. Okay, now if you’re 
hands are stuck together, and if you are good person and want to 
have a lot of fun, I invite you right now to come to the stage and let’s 
get going with the show. I need all these chairs filled up man-woman-
man-woman. You can relax. I think I’ll keep you. Go ahead and have 
a seat right there.
Do you see how I’m doing this I’m now calling for volunteers? What I’ve 
done is I’ve just very quickly gone out there and talked to the audience, and 
what I want to do is create a sense of rapport. Does everybody in here 
understand what rapport is? Is there anybody here that does not know what 
rapport is? If you do not, raise your hands.   

196
I’m going to go over it quickly. Rapport is that you want to be able to identify 
with the audience, and you know that people relate on three levels.
1. By what they see
2. By what they feel, and
3. By what they hear
So you want to do is communicate in a language that allows individuals to 
see things visually. The presentation is very visual. I speak loudly because I 
want them to hear what I’m doing, so I talk in words that they can listen to 
because I want them to hear what I’m doing. 
Then it goes into the feeling. I want you to have this feeling, this sense of 
what we’re going. Put your hands together. Let’s get a little tactile. I want 
people to really relate to all this. 
Then I pull up my volunteer here. Now it’s very simple. I have one, two, 
three, four seats up here that are empty. I need four more people up here. 
I’d like to have two men and two ladies come up here right now. The two 
best looking men and the two best looking ladies stand up right now and 
come forward.
Come forward. Give this powerful guy right here a round of applause and 
make him feel good.
Applause
Give this good looking guy a round of applause.
Applause
Give this lovely lady a wonderful round of applause too.
Applause
Very cool. Stand right here for a minute if you would, please. Stand up. Let 
me take you right here. Hang on for just one moment, please. I’ll take you, 
stand up right here. I’m going to put you right there. Actually, I’m going to 
take you right here instead. I’m going to take you, and I’m going to put you 
over here and I’m going to put you right here. That’s no problem come on 
over here. I’m going to put you right there, very cool. Have a seat sit back in 
your chairs. 
What am I doing to these people? I am doing compliance because I want 
them to follow along with what I’m doing, but I also want to have man-
woman-man-woman. The reason for me is because I want to make sure 
there’s a guy on the end because in the hypnosis show, a person can fall 
[
]
[
]
[
]

197
over. So if somebody is going to fall over, I don’t want it to be a lady I want 
it to be a guy. 
I’ve seen it happen. It doesn’t happen very often. We’re going to talk about 
safety later because we want to make sure that everybody is safe, but I’ve 
got these guys where I want them.
Now something also, when you’re working in a show let’s say that you have 
a lady that has a dress on. You want to make sure the dress covers 
everything because you don’t want people down there being peeping Toms. 
You want to make sure that they’re comfortable because if they feel 
uncomfortable, they are not going to be a good subject. 
That goes back to respecting your volunteers. Have respect and dignity 
because they’re human beings also. You’re going to have some fun, but do 
it in a way that’s very respectful as much as possible. 
Wow! Good looking people. How are you guys doing? Nice. And your name 
is?
Roy.
Hey Roy. How are you doing?
Good, Spencer.
And your name is?
Kristen. Very good. 
So anyway, I like to find out who these people are so I’ll meet them a little 
bit here. Brian, how are you doing?
Fine. Thank you.
And you?

So we’ve got our volunteers up here. What are we going to do next? What 
I’d like to do is another test. I’ve already done a test out here, right? 
Now what I want you to do is sit back in your chairs. Put your arms 
directly in front of you. Squeeze your hands together just like this. 
Put our arms up right there. I want you to stare at your thumbs, right 
there, just stare at your thumbs. Squeeze your hands together one 
more time. Squeeze them together as tightly as you can. Make sure 
that your hands are locked and they are glued and they will not come 
apart.
Squeeze your hands together as tightly as you can. Make sure 
you’re staring directly at your thumbs, directly at your thumbs, 
squeezing your hands together as tightly as you can. Make sure 
those hands are glued and they are glued and they will not come 
apart. Make sure that they are stuck tight, stuck tight, and they will 
not come apart.
Try to pull them apart, they lock tighter and tighter. Try as hard as 
you can to pull them apart, but they are stuck tight. They will not 
come apart. 
You guys can keep playing with that. This is the second test and I do this in 
every show because you know what? You may have a person that goes like 
this. If that’s the case, I’m going to simply just direct them off the stage. I’m 
going to say listen, I think you’re going to have more fun out here. 
It’s not a big deal. You just matter-of-factly take control of your stage. Are 
you messing with me back there? Oh, you guys want to take your hands 
apart? 
Look right here. When my hand comes down, release your hands 
and put your palms down on your lap. Close your eyes down all the 
way. Close your eyes down all the way, very good. Continue to allow 
your eyes to remain closed until I ask you to open them. 
I do not intend on doing that, yet. I’m also telling them what to do. I’ll want 
them to be compliant. I want them to go along with what we’re doing. This is 
a show. It’s a performance and you are the conductor. 
I’m constantly talking here to my volunteers, and I’m constantly turning 
around and talking to the audience because you have to perform for two 
sets of people. You’ve got to make sure you’re with these guys, and then 
Step 3: Suggestion Demo
Spencer:

199
you’ve got to come out here and make sure that the people out here are 
following you. 
You want to see a lot of smiles. Also, you want to hear a lot of whoa. When 
you’re doing your job right, you’ll get people out there going whoa, whoa 
what’s happening? Have fun with it. You’ll know once you begin to do it how 
much fun it’s going to be. 
So I’ve got my people up here hands and palms down. From here, you can 
go into any kind of induction you want to. You’re going to have a couple of 
different kinds of shows that you’ll be doing and different audiences, and 
they’re all going to respond differently. 
You can walk into a high school and you’ve got a bunch of kids. Man, you 
can just drop them on the floor like flies. It’s real easy. College is the same 
way. 
When you get into a corporate crowd you have older people and they’ve got 
their co-workers out there so it’s a whole different kind of presentation that 
you’re doing, because they’ve got to save face for tomorrow and for some 
of the things that you do, they may go oh, I don’t know so they’re going to 
have more reservations.

200
Step 4: The Induction 
Spencer:
So I’ve got the people up here and I’m going to go through an induction, I’m 
not going to do that now, but with the induction part, you can do like a 
fractionization, which is something I like to do. 
There are two parts to that. Is it necessary? Sometimes - never. I do it 
usually for one reason because the people in the audience want to see 
people getting hypnotized. Sometimes if you do it too quickly, people don’t 
get it. They think oh, maybe its set up. So what people want is to watch 
people go into trance. 
They’re seeing these tests that you’re doing here in the audience and the 
tests that you’re doing right here and they’re going wow, that’s crazy. 
You have to understand. This is not my music, we’re using royalty-free 
music, so I have to re-invent what I’m doing in my mind as I go along. 
That’s the thing with having your own music, because I go along with my 
music and I’m always listening to everything that’s going on and if 
something comes up different, it just kind of throws me off and I go whoa, 
what’s that about?
A number of years ago, I did a show for playboy and I got down to LA and 
they go, Mr. Spencer, here’s your music. I go what? They go, here’s the 
music for your show. I go, no I have my own. They go, no I’m sorry but we 
can’t use yours because of copyright laws, so here you go. I’m going oh, my 
gosh. I had like three hours to try to build a whole new routine for this 
playboy show that we did. It was crazy, but we did it. We pulled it off. It 
worked. It was great and we had a fun time. 
So you’ve got your people up here. You’ve got your volunteers up here and 
we’ve done the tests, because I want to know who’s a good subject and 
who’s not. The induction part of it, the fractionization can be as simple as:
Take a deep breath in and breathe out. In just a moment, I will begin 
to relax you step-by-step, as I do just simply concentrate on the 
sound of my voice. I want them to concentrate on the sound of my 
voice, and I tell them, listen to the sound of my voice. 
During your time here with me, the sound of my voice, the touch of 
my hand, the music and the applause from the audience simply 
helps you to relax and go deeper and deeper into hypnosis. 

201
Everything now is about a deepening technique, so I continue deepening 
the trance. Some of these guys may already be in a deep trance, but some 
may be in a light trance. My job now is to make sure that I get everybody 
into the same depth of trance so that they’re all excellent subjects so we 
can have a lot of fun. 
You’ll discover as you begin to go out there in the real world and do this 
with real people who aren’t a bunch of hypnotists in a room who are 
floppers that the rules are going to change. You’re going to have to be a 
little bit more delicate in what you do in your presentation because it’s going 
to be different out there. 
That’s why we’re going to practice over and over in here today, so you guys 
really get this down. 
Relax all the muscles in your head and across your face, down your 
shoulders. What I want you to do is just roll your neck around a little 
bit, would you? Just roll your head around on your neck. Get all the 
stress and all the tension and anxiety out of there. 
Just relax all those muscles. There you go. Let everything go. There 
you go loosely, limply and relaxed. 
And I always say to people, during your time here with me, that touching my 
hand – because I’m going to be touching people, and I want them to know 
that I’m going to touch them. Why? Well, it’s the same thing as in clinical 
work. For those of you who are familiar with doing clinical hypnotherapy, 
you never touch a client unless you let them know you’re going to because 
you may get a big abreaction. 
The same thing applies on the stage. I never touch my subjects unless I let 
them know that I’m going to be touching them, so I let them know up front 
that I’m going to be touching them tonight.  
Listen, as you continue to relax with each breath that you take, you 
may even notice the person next to you move and shift in their 
position. As they do, simply allow those easy movements to help you 
go deeper and deeper and deeper. All those movements help you to 
relax and go even deeper. 
Now, if they happen to put their head on your shoulder, simply enjoy that. 
Enjoy that feeling of their head on your shoulder and have fun with that. 
There you go, way down. There you go.
So it’s the same thing. 

202
When you feel the person next to you touch you, just relax and go 
even deeper to sleep. 
Now there will be times when you are doing this, a person puts their head
on somebody’s shoulder and they’ll open their eyes and they’ll wake up and 
go, what’s going on? You are the trained professional, confident, competent 
stage hypnotist, right? What are you going to do? You have two choices. 
You can either say:
1.
Open your eyes. You’re bugged by these two people on your 
shoulders. You can close your eyes and sleep. Way down. 
2.
And you’re kind of bugged you’re looking at them going, wow. 
And so you’re a good role player. Sleep. Not bad, huh? Okay, 
good. I want you to really enjoy this, so why don’t you go ahead 
and just close your eyes down all the way. There you go. 
Please close your eyes and just relax and enjoy this.  
It might be something as simple as that, and it might be something that’s 
much more difficult, where he just isn’t going to let go because he’s like 
going, I like this feeling. I don’t know if I want to let it go. 
So, I’ll just continue going through the induction, and I’ll let that person sit 
there to hold them up and then after I get everybody else hypnotized, as I 
begin my first routine, I’ll take the person and say thank you very much and 
get them off the stage or have my assistant do that. 
Just make it part of the show. You are trained, competent, confident, 
professional stage hypnotist. You are the consummate ultimate performer, 
nothing fazes you. You deal with what emerges, just like in therapy, right. 
Just handle it. Make it look cool. Make it be smooth. Yeah, you’re going to 
enjoy it out there. 
Then just turn around and go back and start working with people. Trust me 
people are going to be watching you, not them going off the stage. They 
may notice him for a second, but you just go back into your routine and start 
working with somebody else. Just enjoy what you’re doing with that and you 
can have a great time.
Now, these people up here are relaxing.
You can continue to relax all the muscles in your body. 
Now if you folks out there would like to try hypnosis also, I invite you 
to sit back in your chairs and close your eyes down all the way. Put 
your hands, palms down on your lap and your feet flat on the floor. 

203
Now open your eyes, I’m not really asking you to do this I’m going to 
explain what I’m doing. I will do this in the show this is part of the preshow. 
What I do is I have the audience, as I begin doing this, they’re watching 
these people and I’m going, this is pretty cool. 
Now if you guys would like to experience hypnosis yourself and you’re 
maybe a little bit antsy about coming up here to sleep with this hypnotist… 
Laughter
I shouldn’t give away my zinger, should I? 
Go ahead and sit back in your chair, put your feet flat on the floor and 
hands, palms down in your lap. Just a few moments of hypnotic 
relaxation is equal to hours of sleep. In fact, after tonight’s 
presentation, you can go home and party all night long and have a 
great time. So go ahead close your eyes down all the way. 
Breathe in deeply and breathe out. Breathe in deeply and breathe out. 
Breathe in peace and relaxation. Release any stress, any tension, 
any anxiety that you may have. In just a moment, I will begin to 
continue to relax you step-by-step. 
I do this and the people out here in the audience – they’re going for it too. 
Not everybody, but you’ll get a number of people out there. Why I do this is 
because I’ll get people out there in the audience who will get hypnotized. I 
think that’s really cool. I’m doing my show up here and these guys are in 
trance, and I might get two or three or four or five or six or seven or eight or 
nine or ten – who knows – people out there who are hypnotized.
So when I get ready to do my first routine, I’m going to go, before I begin 
though, is there anybody out there that’s sitting next to you that appears to 
be in a trance? You’ll know who they are because their head’s either on 
your shoulder or in your lap, or maybe they’re on the floor. I don’t know, but 
if there’s somebody like that next to you, please raise your hand.
They raise their hands and I’ll go this is cool. Do you know why? Because 
now you get to go out there you get to mess with somebody in the 
audience. 
The second part to that is people dig having you, the performer, come out 
there because wow, they’re next to you. They can see you. You’re there. 
They can almost touch you. I know it’s crazy, but this is how people think of 
the performer. This is the psychology there. 
For example, go to sleep, right there you, young man. There you go. Thank 
you. Let’s pretend that he just went to sleep in the audience.   
[
]

204
If there’s somebody next to you, please raise your hand. Oh, there’s 
somebody next to you? Very good. 
Let me just show you what this is like. I’ll just go off the stage and go, 
excuse me just a second I’m going to go talk to this guy. 
I’m going to touch you right now, sleep very, very deeply. In a 
moment, I’m going to count to three. On number three, your butt’s 
going to be on fire and you’ll very quickly run up to the stage as fast 
as you can because your butt’s on fire. On the stage there’s some 
water. Get ready now 1-2-3 quickly go, quickly, quickly. And sleep. 
Okay, very good. 
Now do you see how we have fun with that? That’s why I’ve got another 
volunteer. Hey, give the volunteer a round of applause, folks. Make him feel 
good.
Applause
Come on up here. Have a seat. Do you see how that works? So, if you 
have like four or five people and you can use your creative imagination to 
come up with different things that you want to say to an individual. Trust 
me, I pick my people very well and I have a lot of one-liners, depending on 
the audience, that you can do.
Remember, you’re playing to the audience and you want to be respectful of 
the audience that you’re with. So you want to keep your show clean, but 
you can use innuendos too that are fun because we’re all adults. A little bit 
of adult stuff is a good thing. It’s a good thing because adults get it, but if 
you’ve got little children, you want to be a little more playful, which is why I 
don’t do shows that little children can go to, except for my son he can go to 
them now. He’s 6 ½, he gets it, but sometimes wonders what I’m doing. 
Okay, so we’ve got our people up here. We’ve got whatever people out 
there in the audience up here to be hypnotized. Now, listen there are three 
kinds of people who probably will never be hypnotized. I want to educate
people. 
1. A small child cannot be hypnotized because they’re already in a 
hypnotic state of mind up until about the age of 8 or 9, somewhere 
along there. 
Whatever you tell that child, they will do they don’t have a critical factor. 
Whatever you do with that child, they’re going to do. That’s why you, the 
parent, are the family hypnotist. How many of you have a small child? Very 
cool. Whatever you teach that child is what they are going to learn. It will be 
up to you to raise that child correctly. So be a good parent, love your kids 
and that’s all I’m going to say about the kids.
[
]

205
2. The second kind of person who cannot or will not be hypnotized is 
somebody who’s had a little too much to drink, or who’s been on the 
buzz there a little bit because they can’t concentrate and you don’t 
want someone who can’t concentrate because they already think 
they’re hypnotized anyway. 
3. The third kind of person is somebody who just has a very low IQ. 
Of course, that’s not you, or you wouldn’t be here, so you can all be 
hypnotized at different times. Let’s get on with the show. 
In a moment, I’m going to count to three, and then I have my first routine set 
up. I’m not going to go into that right now. That will be in the next section 
because I just want to go through this part right here, and then we’re going 
to break into little groups, and you guys can have this experience yourself. 
So I’ve these people up here. They all seem to be doing pretty good. I’m 
going to count to 3, and on number 3, everybody open your eyes. 1-2-3, 
wide awake guys. 
Give them a round of applause. Make them feel good. 
Applause
Now sit back in your chair one more time. Take a deep breath in. 
Exhale and just sleep. Way down.
I’m constantly just putting people into trance. Oh, just stop it. Stop it. Some 
people’s children. When you get people like that I’ll either, take them and 
just drop them down real quick or I’ll just take them and throw them off 
stage. I’m not going to worry about it. 
Way down. There you go. Very cool.

Play With The Panel
Hello? How are you doing? Are you having a good time? Okay, good. Are 
you hypnotized tonight? You think so? 
Everybody open your eyes, wide awake. Okay, cool. Open your eyes 
one more time. And your name was?
Roy.
Roy, what do you do? 
The best I can.
You do the best you can. Okay. Are you hypnotized tonight?
Maybe. 
Maybe? Oh, have you ever been before?
Yeah.
You have been. But maybe you’re not really sure right now, right?
I’m awake now. 
Oh, you’re awake now. So what do you do in real life what kind of work do 
you do?
Solar installations. 
Very cool, I’m glad that you’re here. Sleep! You don’t mind if he’s on your 
lap there for a minute, do you? You can move your hands. Hi, and your 
name?
Kristin.
Kristin, what do you do?
I’m a hypnotist. 
You’re a hypnotist. Really, is that what you do, no kidding. Where do you do 
hypnosis at?
Wherever.

Wow! Okay, very cool. So if you’re a hypnotist, let me ask you – are you 
hypnotized right now?
Yeah, I think so. 
I would think so. Well, it’s good to have you here. Sleep! 
You’re next. Hi, your name is Brian, right. What do you do?
I’m a hypnotist. 
Oh, you’re a hypnotist too, right on. Wow, I got a bunch of hypnotists in 
here. What kind of hypnotist are you?
Hypnotherapist.
A hypnotherapist. And where do you do hypnotherapy at?
In Denmark. 
In Denmark. Let me ask you, being a hypnotherapist, why do you think 
people are doing this isn’t this kind of weird? Do they need therapy, do you 
think? You have no bloody idea. Good to have you here anyway. Sleep!
I want to meet everybody and I want to find out a little bit about them. 
Because what I’m doing, in my mind, I want to know who these people are 
because when I ask them who they are, it helps me to go okay, so this is 
what you do. It helps me to put some things in my mind on where I want to 
go with them and what I can do with them at some point. 
Even though I have all my show laid out – how I want it to appear, how I 
want it to work – there’s always that little part of my mind that – you know, 
you have to be ready for improv. You’ve got to fly by the seat of your pants 
sometimes, because even though you have everything laid out, you may 
not have everybody who’s going to be responsive to everything that you do. 
So I always have about 50 or 60 different routines that I can break into at 
any given moment and then, of course, just basic improv. I’m not a 
comedian. I could not stand up for an hour and talk to people and make 
them laugh. I think that’s the hardest job in the world. But give me a whole 
bunch of people up on stage and I can create mayhem.
Hi, and your name again was?

I’m doing okay.
Yeah, do you want to do better?
Yes.
Yeah, I thought you did. Where are you from?
I’m from Portland.

Oh, well you know they have the Rose Parade there and it’s one of the 
most beautiful things that you could ever imagine, I mean they’ve got these 
roses – I mean they’re everywhere. Actually, it should be going on pretty 
soon, right?
I think so?
Yeah, I mean this is the time of the year where the roses start coming out, 
and wow, that’s awesome. All those brilliant colors. Where did you come 
from before you went to Portland?
Eugene, Oregon.
You made a big leap, didn’t you? What is that? About two hours? 
Yeah. 
Good to have you here. Sleep!
So anyway, it’s the same thing. I want to meet everybody and find out a 
little bit more about them because I look for experiences in my mind that I 
can relate to who they are. Yeah, I know where Portland is. I know they
have roses there. 
Portland is a beautiful city. They’ve got a beautiful river that runs through it. 
They’ve got great fishing. They’ve got some of the best coffee shots in the 
world, outside of Seattle. It’s a lot of fun there, and they’ve got this huge
bookstore downtown. It’s like three stories. It takes up big blocks. What’s it 
called? 
Powell’s.
Powell’s. That’s the one. It’s an incredible bookstore. Anyway, I draw so 
much from my life experiences because I’ve traveled all over the world. So 
it’s fun to do and you can use that in your show.
These are the people we’re going to work with, do me a favor and give 
them a powerful round of applause. Make them feel good. 
Applause
All right. We’ve just done a preshow. Now we’re ready to do our regular 
show. Okay? I’m not going to do that right now. I just wanted to take you up 
to this point to show you what this looks like and how it feels. Do you guys 
think you can do this?
Yes!

Are you guys ready for this?
Yes!
Who’s not ready? I didn’t hear everybody out there saying, yeah. Are we 
ready to be hypnotists?
Yes!
All right and we become hypnotists by doing. We do and we do and we do it 
over and over and over again. I want you guys to do it here. If you do it 
here, you can take it out there and you can do it out there. 
Our goal by the end of these next few days is for you guys to go out there –
and you already have a show coming up, so that’s awesome – and for you 
guys to go home to your home towns, book a show next week and make 
yourself $5,000. Would that be awesome?
Yes!
Yeah, how about if you did two shows for $5,000 each - $10,000 next 
week? Why not? Have fun with it, right? It’s the most incredible profession I 
can even imagine.
I’m going to count to three. On number three, sit up in your chairs. All 
this applause will be for you. 
Now listen, what I say is that all this applause is for you. I like to do that, 
and I encourage you to do that yourself. I see a lot of stage hypnotists that 
are flat and it really drives me crazy. You want to get as much audience 
participation as you can possibly get. 
If you get the audience going, these guys are going to go more because 
listen, the more noise you make, the more they’re going to act out for you. 
The more they act out for you, the more noise you need to make. 
Do you hear what I’m saying? I’m giving dual suggestions here. The more 
noise that you make, the more the people up here on stage are going to act 
out for you. The more they act out, the more noise you need to make. So 
I’m giving these dual suggestions because I want everybody involved. If I 
can get everybody involved, we’re going to have a great time. 
Do me a favor and give these guys a thunderous round of applause.
Applause
Just like that, very cool. You keep that up and we’re going to have a good 
time. And that’s it. 

211
I’m going to count to three. At the number three, sit up in your chairs. 
Once again, all this applause is for you 1-2-3, wide awake 
everybody, wide awake. Wake up. Come on.

Troubleshooting Q&A’s
I have a question more related to what you were saying about how not to 
take subjects that are drunk or on drugs, but in Las Vegas or in the venues 
you’re in, most people are already drinking. How to you differentiate 
between someone who’s – obviously, you can tell if someone is just 
stumbling drunk, but most people at a bar or in a club are going to be 
already intoxicated.
That’s a presumption on your part. A lot of the people will be drinking, and 
most people are drinking, but not everybody is drunk. So when I say drunk, 
I’m talking about the person who comes up there obviously drunk. That’s 
when you say thanks man, I think you’re going to have a much better time 
out there. That’s how I handle that. Does that make sense?
Yeah, so does a little bit of alcohol affect hypnosis that much?
No. A little bit doesn’t, but everybody’s different. Everybody has a different 
tolerance, so I don’t know. It’s just something that you’re going to get a feel 
for as you begin to work with people. Some people can have a few drinks, 
but if they’ve had too much to drink, they’re not going to concentrate and 
they’re going to be kind of goofy. You’ll see a lot of drunks, and they’re just 
being goofy. Just get them off the stage. 
There are times when I’ve had somebody who’s been goofy drunk like that, 
and I’ll just grab them and say sleep and I’ll them on the floor. Just leave 
them there. They’re better off over there. They’re not going to bug me, and 
they’re not going to bug the audience. Then if you get the person who’s 
really drunk who’s just obnoxious, then you just get a bouncer to get them 
out of there. The thing is the audience isn’t there to watch a crazy drunk. 
They don’t want them up there. 
Yeah, I was just going to say I’ve been bartending for 20 years and I’m a 
hypnotist. I pull almost all of my client’s right out of my bar. There’s a big 
difference between somebody who has a scotch or a beer after work and 
somebody who slams a bottle of scotch after work. 
It’s pretty obvious, even a rooky bartender is going to be able to pick that 
guy out. You’re going to see him. You will. Somebody who’s got a shot and 
a beer in them – I mean I’m hypnotizing people in my bar all the time 

213
without them even knowing it, constantly. That’s how I get my clients, so the 
alcohol thing, you’ll be able to tell. 
So does that make sense for you then? So don’t worry about it. It won’t 
happen that often, but I say that because if the person is really drunk, 
they’re going to be a bad subject anyway. 
I guess I would say my fear – that might not even be the best word, but for 
me, the most important part of being a stage hypnotist is the pre-talk. To 
me, I think if you get the pre-talk down, everything is like a piece of cake. I 
got most of what you’re saying can you go over it again?
Sure. I’d be happy to do that. I hear what you’re saying. I want to add 
something to that. Probably 99% of the time, I never do a pre-talk. I do it as 
I go up and start talking to people, and I do it very quickly. After I get 
volunteers up here, then I do a pre-talk with these people up here on the 
stage. 
That’s just the way that I do it, but there’s a lot of value in what you’re 
saying because it will stack the odds in your favor by talking to the audience 
for a little bit, and talking to them about hypnosis – what it’s like and how 
the mind works. So if you wanted to do education and entertainment, you 
can certainly do that. Does that make sense?  
Not necessarily education, because I realize that we’re entertainers and we 
don’t really want to educate people about what hypnosis is all about, but 
getting our volunteers. I mean the fear I was talking about is calling for 
volunteers and no one comes forward. I’m thinking that whatever your pre-
talk is sets the rapport that you need to have…
Let me tell you a story that I think you can relate to. I was invited to do a 
high school reunion. I think it was a 20-year reunion. They hired me and 
they paid me a lot of money. This was in Utah a number of years ago. So I 
went to it, and I got up there and they introduced me. It was in a ballroom 
like this, which is where high school reunions are. I went in there and talked 
to the group for a while. I gave a nice pre-talk, a very thorough one. 
Then I said whoever would like to try this, please come on up. Nobody 
wanted to get hypnotized. Nobody wanted to come up. I’m sitting there 
going, wow. It doesn’t really matter to me because I’ve already been paid, 
but you guys are here and I’m here. I’ll tell you what, how about I give this 
to you because I don’t want to just leave here and take your money. 
How about if I talk to you a little more about the dynamics of the human 
mind would that interest you? They go, yeah, so I spent the next 15 minutes 
talking about why people have fears and insecurities. I talked to them about 
anxiety. I talked to them about confidence and no confidence and about 
what it’s like to grow up as a child with all your friends.

So now, here we are 20 years later in a room, if somebody sees what I’m 
doing right now that’s different then what I did 20 years ago or if I have had 
some secrets. Then, all the sudden I’m hypnotized and they see something 
that happened or they hear me say something that happened, boy, that’s 
not going to be good. I don’t want any of my secrets to come out. 
This high school reunion invited me to do a show and they paid me a lot of 
money. Nobody wanted to get hypnotized after a lengthy pre-talk. A very, 
very good one, I did a good job. I already had maybe 2,000 shows under
my belt, so I was pretty confident in what I was doing, but nobody wanted to 
come up, so I decided to talk to them about their own fears and insecurities. 
After I did that, I said now you know what, you guys can continue to live in 
that fear or you can take a risk right now and enjoy something really cool 
that could happen for you just by coming up here and having a good time. 
Who would like to do that now? The whole stage filled up. How do you 
know? Even on the best night, setting up right, there are so many different 
dynamics to that. 
Another example I wanted to add on to that. When I was doing shows at the 
Avalon Theater – I did that for 6 ½ years straight, every Saturday night – I 
never did a pre-talk; never. Partly was because people already knew what 
to expect. They knew what to expect because they had heard about what I 
do to people when they come to my show there. I don’t mess around, man. 
I’d have people come to the show lining up in front of the stage. I’d have 30 
or 40 people lined up in front of the stage. You’re shaking your head 
because you were there. How many of my shows did you go to there in Salt 
Lake?
Quite a few. Yeah, I’ll ask you to talk about that later because I think that 
was pretty cool you were there, I didn’t realize that. But I liked to take 20, 30 
or however many people wanted to volunteer. They would come up here 
and they would line up sometimes two and three bodies thick. I’d have them 
put their hands over their heads and they’d lock them up like this. Then I’d 
just take and grab them and say, sleep, and just drop them across the 
stage. That’s it. That was my show. It had begun right then. 
People would walk in, the lights were off, I had strobe lights going, I had 
funky flashing lights going and I had smoke everywhere. It was like a rock n’ 
roll show, it was a rock n’ roll show. It was a nice production. I’d just drop 
people. Then after they were dropped, I’d say everybody on the count of 
three get up here on the chairs very quickly, and I went right into my routine 
just like that, just smoked it down.

215
There’s an entertainment aspect of it. It depends on how you want to 
present yourself. Who are you talking to? I would never do that for a 
corporate group. I would take time. I would dress up and give them what 
they want. I would talk to them very politely in a very businesslike manner 
because I would have more rapport. 
But, people coming to that show, they just wanted to be messed with. They 
just wanted to see what’s the hypnotist going to do tonight? What’s he 
going to wear this time? What’s he going to look like? What’s he going to do 
that’s crazy? 
Does that answer that question? Does anybody else have any questions 
before we break into little groups? 
Yeah, I don’t know how relevant it is, but like you got a room – have you 
pre-designated I’m going to have 20 chairs up there on the stage? I guess 
it’s a ratio maybe. You have 250 people in the audience, so you say to your 
staff or whatever, I want 20 chairs. Or is it 10 or five. How do you develop 
how many you want to work with?
The chairs that are sitting up here are part of the suggestion. I’ve got 20 
empty chairs up there. People are sitting up there going, one, two, three… 
they’re looking around going I wonder who’s going to be doing this? People 
are out there talking about it, and they’re trying to figure out what’s going to 
be happening? So I always have 20 chairs up there. 
I normally will not do an audience under 500 people anyway. I just don’t 
want to. I like larger audiences, but I will. I mean if somebody hires me and 
wants to pay me $5,000 to do 200 people, that’s fine. I don’t care. But I’ll 
still have the same amount of chairs up there. That gives everybody an 
opportunity. 
Whoever wants to try it they can, because even if you have 20 chairs, 
maybe not everybody will get hypnotized, but I’m going to give them a 
chance. My job is not to educate these people. It’s like let’s have fun. If 
you’re not going to be a good subject, get off my stage.
Right. Now again, going back to – I live in a real small town. I’m going to do 
the Elk’s Lodge or the Lion’s Club. You know four, five or six. That way, you 
can kind of keep it under control. 
Those are the most fun. No. Don’t do five or six chairs up there. Don’t. Don’t 
do it. Don’t have less than 15 chairs up on your stage ever. 
Don’t have less than 15?

Don’t do it. Don’t do it. Do not do it. If you only have five chairs, you’ve only 
got five people. What if they all suck? You’re going to have a bad night. I 
would rather have 15 possibilities up here than five people that are not 
going to be very responsive, especially in the Elk’s Lodge. 
I’ll be lucky to have 50 people at the Elk’s Lodge.
Say that again.
I’ll be lucky to have 50 people at the Elk’s Lodge.
That’s interesting programming you’re doing for yourself how does that 
work? Do you hear what you’re saying?
I don’t get it. No. Oh, I see what you’re saying. Okay.
I say that with all due respect because, listen, we’re here to program 
ourselves to be powerful, confident, competent stage hypnotists, and we 
have to think differently. I am not going to go into a room where I’m going to 
be lucky if I get 50 people. No way. I’m going to make sure that I have at 
least 100, 200, 500 or whatever it’s going to take to make my show 
successful.
I see. 
Applause
That’s part of the deal. We only have a few more minutes, so I want to 
break up into groups. I know that we’re covering a lot of ground.
Yesterday we were talking about shock. I noticed you did the shock 
induction and they stayed there the whole time. How does that work?
I hear what you’re saying. Understand that we’re a room full of hypnotists. 
Can I do that in a room of non-hypnotists? Yes, but there’s a different level 
of what we’re doing in this room where things take place unconsciously. 
I don’t want to sugar-coat it and make it sound like something different is 
going on. If I do a shock induction and they stand there, why do they stand 
there? Well, number one they’re hypnotized and I tell them to stand there. 
The unconscious mind does what it’s told. If there’s no other logical reason 
for it to not do it, it will say okay. That’s the nature of the subconscious 
mind. 
The conscious mind is the intellectual mind that’s always going whoa, 
what’s going on here? The subconscious mind is the emotional mind and it 

217
just goes yep, whatever you want I don’t care. It’s the one that says yep, 
feels good to me. Does that make sense?
Yeah, it’s just that it was very clear yesterday that you want to take 
advantage of that moment, because they’ll come back up. 
Are you talking about like doing a street demonstration type thing?
Is it different than what you just did?
It’s really no different. What did you want to say?
I would sometimes come back up, like I know that my eyes opened a 
couple of times, but when I heard the sound of his voice and you guys 
laughing, I remember my mind said oh, deepen. Go down, and I would go 
back down to the same deep state.
Listen, the people that I have up here on stage that I’m going to keep, 
they’re hypnotized no matter. They can sit there and chat back and forth 
and they can look at you and smile and do whatever, but I can over there 
and go sleep, it doesn’t really matter because they’re still going to drop. 
Wide awake, do you see what I’m saying? It doesn’t really matter because 
you are the constant performer. You take control of what’s happening. So 
we don’t worry about those things. I know you’re asking because you 
haven’t seen it, you’re not familiar with it and you haven’t done that so you 
don’t have that experience. 
That’s what we’re doing here now. That’s why I’m going over this and really 
stressing it to you and trying to give it to you in a real simple manner. It’s 
like, this is what you can do, and you’re going to know it as you get out 
there and begin to do it and have the experience. One day you’re going to 
go, I get it. Now I get it. It just works. You’ll know by doing. 
I’m so proud of all you who have been going out there and just doing it, I 
think it’s awesome. You guys are blowing my mind. I’m going to have to 
follow some of you guys out there and see what’s happening. 
Spencer?
Yes?
Don, may I interject something there.
Yes.
I think one of the things that – I don’t know if you were in the Hypnosis 
Certification Program training that we did with Igor, but one of the things 
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:

Spencer:

218
that we learned in that is that just because somebody opens their eyes or 
says something does not necessarily mean that they have come out of 
trance. They can still be in trance and they can actually still respond.
Does that clarify that for you?
Yes.
It is important to do the deepeners. If you think back, what I’ve been saying 
is everything is a deepener. I’ve already clarified that. Everything I do –
listen, during your time up here with me, the sound of my voice helps you to 
go deeper into hypnosis. So, as I’m talking they’re still going deeper. 
There’s a part, like she said I hear his voice and I just seem to get 
hypnotized. 
So the sound of my voice, the music and everything becomes a hypnotic 
suggestion; everything. Everything in the environment is part of it.
Can I just add a little something?
Add it.
Thank you. Last night I had a group of four people in front of me. It was a 
husband and wife, husband and wife. I was doing a quick induction and the 
gentleman with the baseball cap on was going down really quick. So I woke 
everybody else up and I listened to what you said last night about bringing 
the audience in.
So I had them stand all around me and I said, okay, we’re going to have 
some fun with them. Wake up, wake up; watch, watch, watch. I said, okay 
play with the ball, your energy ball in your hand. The guy was going like 
this. I said, the more you play with the ball, the deeper you’re going to go. 
Just like Don was up there just talking about the sound of my voice, the 
laughter of the crowd, the applause, that has a deepening effect. So they’re 
getting fractionated when they come up and they go down. Then, I said 
what I’m going to do is I’m going to take your baseball cap off and as soon 
as I take your baseball cap off, you are going to go down.
I took it and he went out. He had his hands in front of him and I was playing 
with the crowd at that point, and I said okay here we go. I just grabbed him 
and jerked him and sleep. Just like Don was saying, use the words that he’s 
saying. Listen to him. Every time you apply something, use the sound 
around you. 
We were in a bar last night. You couldn’t frickin’ hear your own voice. There 
were four women up in front of us and one of them was scared to fly. I took 
Spencer:
Student:

Spencer:

219
the music, had her dance with the music to get over the fear of flying. So 
you can use anything around you to put people down.
Okay, let’s move on. We’ve only got a couple of minutes left, so I need to 
wrap up this session anyway. 
Let me ask you, are you getting a good understanding of this preshow, 
before the show even begins? Is it making sense to you?
Yes.
Is it really making sense to you?
Yes!
Okay. 
What we’re going to be doing here, in two minutes we’re going to be taking 
a break. Go outside and mingle with yourselves. Enjoy it. When we come 
back, Igor is going to be taking over the next section. He’s going to do a 
bunch of group things with you to help take what we’ve done here and build 
on it so you can have some more fun with that.
Have I woken these guys up yet?
No.
Are you guys woken up yet? A couple of you. Yes. No. Well, that will give 
you something to think about, and when you think about this other thing, 
remember, everybody is already in a trance. It doesn’t matter. You don’t 
have to apply a hypnotic induction to put a person in a trance. Even a 
person that says I cannot be hypnotized I go, oh cool, you’re the, “I can’t be 
hypnotized trance person.”
So everybody is in a trance already. We’ve just got to figure out what it is. 
Once we figure out what that trance is, anybody can be hypnotized quick. 
Just have fun with it, and that’s all I do. If you’re out there on the street 
doing it’s the same thing I do on stage with somebody. If I’m having a 
problem, if I have time, I might talk to them and figure out what’s going on. 
Who are you? What do you need? What do you want? I’ll talk to them and 
get some rapport-building skills going on there. 
Then when I find that moment of passivity that I know then I’ll say, oh cool. 
Sleep! Bam! Does that make sense? The moment of passivity when you’re 
doing street hypnosis, or even stage hypnosis, I’m always looking at 
people. I’m looking at their eyes. I’m looking at their demeanor. I’m trying to 
figure out who’s who, what’s what and how am I going to do it?
Spencer:
Students:
Spencer:

220
I look for that moment of passivity. It’s this look that you see in a persons 
eyes and in their face and when you know, it’s like yeah, they’re mine. For 
those of you out there who have been doing this and hypnotizing a lot of 
people, you know what I mean. The moment of passivity is that moment 
when a person’s conscious mind just kind of goes… and the subconscious 
mind opens up and you can go, sleep, now!
So go out and have a moment of passivity. We’ll see you back here in just a 
little bit.

Practice Your Intro
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
Welcome back. How are you all doing? 
Great.
Did you enjoy the last section? 
Yes.
If I understand it correctly, you spent the morning looking at the whole 
preshow thing, how to get to the point where the show is actually rolling and 
you’re doing all your demos and that sort of stuff.  
What we’re going to do now is get you guys to do it. It’s one thing seeing it. 
It’s actually another thing rehearsing it and doing it yourself. In a moment, 
we’re going to hand out a little strip of paper like this. I’d like you to look for 
your name and we’re going to get into groups of six. 
You’ll notice that there will be gray and white strips, and each pairing of 
gray and white is one group, so there will be one group of six. In fact, I 
might as well just quickly give you an announcement and read the names 
out. We’re going to have, I think, its 12 or 13 groups. 
So if I just point to different parts of the room, if you would just move over 
there. Bring chairs with you because you’re going to do exactly the same 
thing you saw Spence doing here. So you’ll have six people per group. 
Some groups will be a little smaller just because of numbers. We’ll manage 
those. Don’t worry about the strips right now. We’ll hand them out 
afterwards. We’ll just move into groups now. Then we’ll start doing those 
things bit by bit. Sound good?   
So you all have your groups. Make yourselves comfortable. Here’s what 
we’re going to do. Give each other within your groups a number from 1-5 or 
1-6. That will be the order you’ll be taking turns in today. It allows us to keep 
things rolling as we go along. 
I want number 1 to be the hypnotist first, then number 2, 3 and so on and so 
forth. Make sense? Go ahead and number yourselves now and then we’ll 
start the actual training. 
Hypnotists please stand up. Everyone else, please line up in front of them 
as though you were sitting in these chairs here. Okay, I think we’re looking 
good here. 

222
We’re going to start with the whole preshow step-by-step. We’re going to 
assume that the intro music and all that stuff we’ve been talking about, has 
been dealt with. So you have just been announced. You’re going to now 
walk onto the stage and you’re going to do two things. You’re going to be 
off stage in a moment and you’re going to walk on like someone just 
introduced you. In fact, you can have one of your group members introduce 
you if you like. 
You’re going to walk on with a big smile in your full performance character. 
Make sure you walk on you get into that peripheral vision state we did 
yesterday. When you walk on, two things you’re going to do, the only things 
you’re going to do are:
1. Introduce yourself. 
Hi, I’m Igor. 
2. Give them a 10- maybe 20-second intro about the show or hypnosis 
in general.
Hi, I’m Igor. I’m your hypnotist tonight. We’re going to have a great time. For 
those of you who don’t about hypnosis, it’s just the power of the mind. 
We’re not going to ask you to do anything today other than have fun. I’m 
going to ask you to do nothing I wouldn’t ask my own mother to do. 
It doesn’t really matter how you introduce yourself. I only want to have a 10-
to 20-second self intro, plus an intro for your show in general. Does that 
make sense? It’s going to be very, very quick. In this next bit we’re going to 
be zipping through a lot of things very quickly and you’ll have several go’s 
at this so I don’t think about it too much. It will evolve as we go along. 
Do you have a general idea of what you want to say when you introduce 
yourself and your show, yes?
Hypnotists, put your hands up when you have general idea of what you 
want to say. All right, put your hands down. Put your hands up if you have 
any questions about this or any concerns or you’re not quite sure what to 
say yet. Here’s your chance. You will be fine because you get to watch 
them first.  
[Makes comment].
Heterosexual, yeah well, that’s good. You’re just going to introduce 
yourself, like hi, my name is Bill. I’m Bill the fastest hypnotist in the world, or 
whatever and then you’re going to introduce your show. Today is a good 
family show. Hypnosis is just the power of the mind. I’m going to show you 
some amazing things. 
Student:
Igor:

223
It’s just to make people feel excited about your show that’s all. Remember, 
what is the point of the introduction? It’s to encourage people to volunteer. 
When they come in, people don’t know what to expect yet. Your 
introduction will decide whether, or not people will want to volunteer. 
If you come in and go h-h-h hi, I’m going to hypnotize you now. Please 
come on stage, they’ll go, I don’t know about this. Why don’t you go? So the 
whole purpose of your introduction is to let people know what character 
your show will be and that they’ll be safe up here whatever venue you 
happen to be in.
In nightclubs you can be a little bit more outrageous; at family affairs, you’ll 
be a little bit more conservation; at corporate shows, you’ll be very
conservative and on. Does that make sense? So just have that sense of 
how you’re going to introduce yourself. Walk on, do the intro and in 30 
seconds’ time I will cut you off, and the next person will be on. We’ll be 
rolling through this very quickly. Make sense?
Does everyone know what we’re doing? Hypnotists off stage, please. Keep 
an ear out for me because I’m going to be timing you and I’ll be switching 
around each group. Okay folks, starting now, 30 seconds, introduce 
yourselves.

224
Get Volunteers
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
Student:
Igor:
Okay, folks. Face in so you can see. Was that fun? 
Yes.
A little bit hectic, right? Did you feel a little bit of tingle, like the excitement 
beginning to build now? This is what a show feels like. This is what you’ll be 
doing on the final day, but right now we’re just getting into it step-by-step.
The second step I want you to get used to is calling for volunteers. So, now 
that you’ve got people excited about your show, you want people to start 
volunteering to come on board. Right now, you’re just talking to an 
audience. Do you see what I mean? 
Here’s what I’m going to do. We’re going to have in each group three 
people come up and volunteer. Decide who’s going to be number 1, 2, 3 
and then 4 for volunteers, and numbers 5 and 6 will stay in the audience. 
You have to have a split between audience and volunteers, so that you get 
used to looking in both directions. Make sense? 
Volunteers, when you come up please take your chairs up with you 
because we don’t have enough chairs to go around. When the volunteers 
come up, come up individually. So we’ll have one volunteer, the hypnotist 
will have to keep talking and kind of get you excited and then we’re going to 
get a second volunteer; keep talking, get them excited and then get a third 
volunteer. Does that make sense?
You will have one minute to do the whole thing. You’ll have one minute to 
come in, introduce yourself, call for volunteers and keep teasing them to 
make sure more volunteers come up on stage until you have your full three 
seats. Does that make sense? You have only one minute for the whole lot. 
Decide how you’re going to present that time. Just remember, they’re not all 
going to come up at once, so you’re going to have extra time to keep 
getting them excited and coming up. Does that make sense to everyone? 
Any questions? 
Could you run through it for us?
Sure.
Hi guys, I am Igor. Thank you for your kind welcome. We have a great show 
for you today. It’s all about the power of the mind. I’m going to show you the 
most amazing things about how your mind works. Up here you see five 

225
chairs. In a moment, I’m going to ask you guys to come up here if you want 
to experience the true power of your own mind. 
You’re going to have the most fun you’ve experienced in a long time. Rest 
assured I’m not going to ask anyone here to do anything I wouldn’t ask my 
own mother to do. So, if you want to have fun, if you want to have a 
discovery of your mind, just come on up right now and experience the 
power of hypnosis in your life. Come on up right now. 
Does that work? Then as people start coming up, that’s right. You’re the 
first one. You’re going to have such a great time. Up you come. Sit right 
over here. Okay everyone else, come on up, come on up. 
Sound good?
Yes.
You have one minute, so please get ready. Is everybody ready to start? 
Your minute starts now. 
Applause
Are you starting to feel it? All right. The pressure’s on.
Students:
Igor:

226
Suggestion Demo
Igor:
So, we’ve come on, we’ve introduced ourselves, we’ve excited people 
about the show and we’ve called for volunteers. The next step in the 
sequence is to get more volunteers through the testing phase.
You can kind of mix these up a little bit. You can do the test first and then 
call for volunteers or you can call for volunteer’s first, test everyone and 
have a second run of volunteers come up after that. That’s a very nice way 
of getting more volunteers. Does that make sense? 
I’m going to give you two minutes apiece. In those two minutes, you will 
come on, you will introduce yourself, you will introduce your show, you will 
call for volunteers and you will do a quick, simple suggestion demo. It could 
finger vice, it could hand lock, it could be this one. I don’t care which one it 
is, but you’re going to do this with the whole audience. 
When you first call for volunteers, only one person will come up. Just like 
one of those really quiet shows. You’re going to do the test with the whole 
audience and maybe the person on stage if you want, it’s up to you. You’ll 
do it to the whole audience and then whoever can succeed with that, you’ll 
invite them to come up as well. 
Don’t force them. They can still have a choice. You’ll say you guys did 
great. Come on up. You’ll have a great time. You’ll be surprised with how 
good this is, and so on and so forth. Does that make sense?
You’re just adding one more layer to what you’ve done, which is test and 
another call for volunteers. Easy? Ready for this? All right, number 1, 
please get ready. Number 1, are you ready? All right this group’s almost 
ready. Okay, your two minutes start now – exercise begins-.
All stop and just face the front again, please. 

227
The Induction
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
How’s that? Are you guys having fun? 
Yee haw.
Much better. Do you guys feel like you’re starting to do some showmanship 
stuff here? You’re like in a show, yes? 
The next step is we’re going to do the whole thing again. This time you’re 
going to get three minutes apiece. You may actually have less time in the 
actual show, but three minutes is decent time. 
In the three minutes, you’ll do the same self intro. You’re still into your 
show. You’ll call for volunteers you’ll test and get more volunteers. Then 
we’re going to do the full induction. The full induction is not technically 
necessary to do stage hypnosis, but its part of what people expect, so you 
may as well give it to them. 
I want you to remember three things for the formal induction.
1. Ask the audience to be quiet for the next segment. Build up that 
sense of mystery. Be quiet enough that you can actually do the 
induction with the people on the stage. Help them concentrate. 
So ask the audience politely to give you the space and give the people on 
the stage enough space to be hypnotized and so to be quiet for a few 
minutes whilst you do that.
2. Do your induction.
Literally, take no more than 30 or 40 seconds because you don’t have that 
much time.
3. Get what’s left of your audience to give the people in trance a great 
big cheer as a kind of building anticipation. 
A nice way to frame it is to say, you guys on the stage here, in a moment 
you’re going to hear the sound of your fellow people in the audience 
clapping and applauding. Every time you hear that, you’ll go deeper, and 
you’ll have an even better show. 
That sets the atmosphere up so these guys, when they applaud these guys, 
they’ll further in trance and they get a better show, so they get a sense of 
like hey, I’m going to hypno-applaud these people. Does that make sense? 
It’s just a very nice frame to build the applause from the audience. 

228
So is that easy to do? Three minutes apiece. Ready to do this- number 1, 
please get ready. All right folks, ready? Begin. 
Bring your chairs back to the main group. Your time is up. Give yourself a 
round of applause.  
Applause

229
Time Control
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
A couple of things. Did you notice how three minutes is not a very long time 
when you’re doing stuff? This is important. When you do a regular stage 
show, you’ll probably have 15 minutes to do the whole thing you’ve just 
been doing so far; 10 minutes if you want to and that’s a luxury, isn’t it? 
However, this Sunday, remember you’re doing a 9-minute show. If you run 
over, you have like 9 ½ minutes, but then we pull you off. So if it’s the 
middle of the show, you’ll get pulled off in the middle of the show; 
otherwise, the next person in line won’t have a chance to do their own 
promo tape. Does that make sense?
This means you have to be precise in your timing. Don’t worry. You’ll have 
another go at this. Tomorrow we’ll be drilling you on all the timings and 
drilling you on kind of a mini show as well so that you can get prepared for it 
properly. However, this is a taste and something for you to start thinking 
about is what can you cut out? 
Some of you were done with the whole thing within two minutes. Some 
went up to the three-minute mark and you only just started doing the 
suggestion tests and so on. Does that make sense?
So you can do it within the time it is absolutely possible, you just have to cut 
out a lot of the fat in between, all of the wording and verbiage and all that 
sort of stuff. You can start adding that back in as you have more time in 
your show and are making more of a meal of it so people get entertained by 
it too. Does that make sense?
So you should be able to scale your show all the way down to nine minutes, 
which is what you’ll be doing on Sunday. That’s the shortest show in the 
world. If we actually had time to contact the Guinness Book of Records to 
confirm it, you’d probably be in the record books because this is literally the 
shortest hypnosis show if the world and it will be a fun show. 
Then when you do a normal show, like a 60-minute or 90-minute show, you 
have 10 or 15 minutes to do the whole thing. So you can really take your 
time with it. Don’t take half an hour because doing half a show of just doing 
an induction is not fun. 
Did you enjoy that?
Yes!
Thank you.

Play With Your Audience
Other then that let’s get to work, I need some volunteers. Let’s pick up 
where we left off earlier. I have five chairs here, which means I need five 
volunteers. I need three men and two women or I need five women. I want 
the best looking women in here and the best looking guys.
If you didn’t stand up right now and come forward, what does that say about 
what you’re saying to yourself unconsciously folks? I do say that in my 
shows, because it puts a little bit of guilt and shame on people. Well, the 
pressure’s on when you’re doing a show to get people up there. 
That’s my son, if anybody wants to see him. I should put a little voice in the 
background that goes, sleep. Look at that picture of my son. I actually have 
one of him doing that I should put that on there. I have a little video of him 
doing that. He’s got on one of my jackets and a pair of shades
How are you guys doing?
Great!
Are you ready to do this? I’ve got to get my paper to follow the script, unlike 
what I normally do. Wow, have you guys ever been hypnotized before?
Yes.
No kidding, so are you guys ready for this?
Yes.
This is going to be cool, I like this. Patrick? Where are you from again?
Scotland.
It’s good to have you here. Debra, where are you from?
Norman, Oklahoma.
Michael?

That’s the way I work, I mean if I say, why don’t you just bring me down 
there. It’s a lot easier for both of us. 
Linda, where are you from?
Dayton, Ohio
Dayton, Ohio.
I’m sorry I took mine off at lunch and haven’t put it back on, sorry. It’s a New 
York thing.
You took it off at lunch. This is a clean show. 
Sometimes you don’t want people reading your information, I hate that.
Okay, cool. Let’s get right to it. You have all been hypnotized before, you’ve 
all done this, so this shouldn’t be too difficult for you. 
Debra, sleep!
Linda, how are you doing, sleep!
Michael, are you happy now? 
Oh yeah, thanks very much.
You’re bringing me to Australia, right? What the hypnotist giveth, the 
hypnotist can take away. Good to have you here, Michael, sleep!
I don’t need to know your name. I just need to know that you’re going to go 
to sleep. Yeah, you’re next, sleep!

Warm Up 1: Beach Trip
Spencer:
Very good. We get everyone hypnotized very quickly because we want to 
move through rapidly, so we’re going to go into the first routine. But before 
we do, I’m going to give you a little deepening, because they’ve been kind 
of sitting out there and walking around and I want to make sure that my 
guys up here are very responsive.
Is there anybody else out there who would like to play with this right now? If 
you do, sit back in your chair. I’m serious, man. If you want to do this, I’ll 
take you all through it, but you can watch out there with your eyes wide 
open, with your ears, wide awake, listening, watching, observing and doing. 
The first routine will be number 2, in just a minute and I’ll give you a cue for 
that.
When you’re doing a show, after you’ve got people hypnotized, you always 
set it up… there are two things that are included in the shows that I always 
do.
1. I always have music in the background.
Once the show begins, I always have some music going in the background, 
some kind of little ditty is playing. The reason I do that is because I do not 
like to have a dead spot. There’s nothing worse than having silence in 
between the skits. I want things to keep on groovin’, things to happen. 
2. I always do the same routines.
Once I get to that point, and I’ve got the people up here hypnotized the way 
I want to, I’m ready to do my first routine. Now when I do my routines, I do a 
lot of the same routines every time. The reason I do the same routines is 
because still, even though you’ve got some great subjects, you don’t know 
if they’re all going to be great subjects. 
Some of these people may respond to an idea and others may not. You 
never know. You hope that you’ve got great subjects, so I do the same 
routines every time because now I’m going to weed out the people who I 
think are really good and who I think would have more fun in the audience. 
With that said, after I’ve got the people up here – remember, this is where 
we left off last time, right with people dropped. Okay, so we’ve got them 
dropped again. That was a hard task. 
In a moment, I’m going to count to three and we’re going to see just 
how well you guys have concentrated. I’m going to count to three 

233
and we’re going to go to the beach. We’re going to have a good time. 
On the beach, we’re going to have a fantastic time on the beach. 
You’re walking around, you’ve been talking to people, you’ve had a 
little too much to drink, but you’re really having a good time.
In fact, I’ll count to three, you’ll sit up in your chairs and you’ve had 
way too much to drink. In fact, you’re just a little bit drunk. The 
craziest thing you’ve ever felt. Right now you can even feel that 
coming into your mind. You’re feeling a little woozy, you’re not going 
to throw up your stomach is fine. 
You see, I want to make it clear they’re not going to get sick. You can tell a 
person that they’re drunk, but I’ve seen people chuck on stage, not a 
pleasant sight. Remember, you’re the hypnotist, it is a suggestion and 
people do take suggestions literally. So remember your role is always to 
watch out for what’s happening. So even if I give them a suggestion, I’m still 
going to watch them and make sure that, to the best of my ability, nothing is 
going to go south on me.
Before we go any further, right now I’m going to count to three. 
Everybody sit up in your chairs, eyes still closed, going deeper and 
deeper to sleep. I want you to put a seatbelt on very quickly. I’ll count 
to three you’ll put a seatbelt on because you’re a little bit drunk. You 
had too much drink 1-2-3, sit up in your chairs very quickly. Sit up in 
your chairs and put on a seatbelt. Do it quickly. Put on your seatbelt. 
Quickly, put on your seatbelt. Put it on nice and tight, nice and tight.
Eyes all the way closed down, sleeping very, very deeply still. Still 
sleeping very deeply very good. Very cool. Nice. Nice. Nice.
This time I’m going to count to three, and at number three…
And this is how we do the cue I’m going to count to three and the music 
beings.
1-2-3, okay cool. You’re just on the beach right now. Kind of bee-
bopping around. You’ve had a lot to drink. Put your hand out there 
for a second. Let me give you something to drink. There you go. 
Have a glass. There you go. Have a drink right there. Have a drink. 
Take a drink. Really enjoy that. 
Oh yeah, take it down. This is a double shot of the best Tequila 
you’ve ever had. Oh yeah, this is really getting good now this is 
some of the best stuff you’ve ever had. I’m telling you this is 
awesome. This is good. Go ahead. Take another drink. It’s going to 
make you laugh. Take another drink it’s going to make you laugh. It’s 
so good.

234
You guys out there, make a lot of noise because the more noise you make 
the more they act out. The more they act out, the more noise you need to 
make. 
Keep on drinking. Hey, I just found this really cool bud on the beach, 
man who wants to try this? Who wants to try this? Oh, you do down 
there? Let’s go for it. Here, take a hit off of that. Take a big hit off it. 
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Take that. Pass it down. Pass it over, man. Pass 
it over. Give her a hit of that. Oh, you want to keep it. Don’t bogart 
that joint, my friend. Pass it over. 
Take a big hit off of that. Oh man, if that doesn’t make your eyes go 
backwards, nothing’s going to. Whew. Oh yeah. Okay, Michael, take 
a big hit off that, man. Blow the smoke out. Oh yeah, blow some 
smoke rings, buddy. Oh yeah. Oh man, that feels so good. That is 
some of the best bud I’ve ever had. 
Yeah, keep on smoking that baby. Oh yeah. That feels so good. Oh 
yeah, right on. Oh yeah. Wow, Michael, what do you think about that, 
man?
It’s good. 
Yeah, what kind is it?
Hydrohead. 
Hydrohead, man that’s some good stuff. 
Hey Debra, how are you feeling? 
Good.
Yeah, you’re getting pretty wasted, aren’t you?
Yeah. 
Do you want another hit off of that?
Yeah. 
Give Debra another hit off of that, Michael. Come on. Take another 
hit off of that, man. Oh yeah. Wow. Whew. Pass it down. Pass it on 
down. Pass it back down to Linda she hasn’t had any. Linda, reach 
out. Come on, Linda. Give that to Linda. She hasn’t had any. Go 
ahead and take a hit off of that.

I’ll tell you what, let’s get off the beach. Let’s get in the car, man. 
Let’s get on a little dune buggy. You’ve got your seatbelts on, right? 
We’re in a dune buggy we’re driving down the sand right now. There 
you go. Everything is cool, but look out here comes some big sand 
dunes. 
Look out for the sand dunes and POP! Oh boy, look out. You’re 
going to go over that hill again, and POP! There you go. Go ahead 
and turn to your left. Turn to your left and watch out for the sand. 
Then turn to your right. Look out! Don’t fall out of the dune buggy.
Look at the police. There are some cops coming down. Here comes 
the beach patrol. Here comes the beach patrol. Throw your joint out 
the window. Throw it out the window. What are you going to do with 
your drink? What are you going to do with it?
Applause and laughter
All right. You guys are doing good. Here’s what I’m going to have 
you do. Go ahead and take another big drink of that and this time 
when you do you’re going to pass out. Take another and you’re just 
going to pass out this time. And just sleep! Way down. 
Give them a round of applause. Make them feel good.
Applause
Let’s talk about what this is about. I want to find out who’s a good subject, 
so we give them the idea they’ve been drinking on the beach. So they’re 
drinking on the beach they’re having some cocktails. You can see they’re 
really getting into this, too, right? They’re like going this is some good stuff, 
man. This is like free drinking. 
So when you go out and do some street hypnosis tonight, you can say 
listen, I can save you a lot of money tonight. Don’t give $50 to the bartender 
just give me $20, and I’ll give you a better night with absolutely no 
hangover, exactly.   
So with these people here – sleep! There you go. Loosely, limply, 
relaxed very good, stuck to your chair? Stuck to your chair? 
You notice how I put a safety belt on everybody, a seatbelt when they went 
through that ride. That’s a safety thing that you can do to make sure that 
they don’t fall out of their chairs. Does that mean they won’t fall out of their 
chairs? No. But you’re trying to do the best you can with what you’ve got. 
So if you add on these safety features, it will help you to do your best to 
take care of your subjects at all times.

236
So we started with the drink, and I thought well okay, most people like to 
have a hit once in a while. Not me, I don’t do it. No, I really don’t. You can 
laugh, but I don’t. I just don’t. 
Anyway, moving along, then we moved onto the next routine, where 
everybody’s drunk and then they get a little bit stoned, which is pretty cool. 
It’s fun because the audience wants to see these people acting out. That’s 
what makes it fun and makes it an audience participation show, because 
you guys get to see what they’re doing and you’re going wow, I can relate 
to that. 
So when I’m picking out routines as a hypnotist, I’m always thinking, first, of 
things that I can relate to. Oh-oh, busted. Wait a minute Igor gave this to 
me, okay?
Laughter
He gave that to me. That’s not mine really. 
If you can relate to it, then you can present it. So, when you’re working on 
developing skits on your own – not today, we’ve got skits for you, but when 
you go out into the real world – look around the world in your own life. If you 
can relate to it, then you can convey that to the people on stage, and you 
can convey it to the audience.
If you’re trying to emulate somebody else because you think it’s kind of fun 
or kind of goofy but you don’t really feel it, you just think that it would work it 
probably isn’t going to come off as well because you can’t feel it. 
Remember, I said that this is an art. It’s a craft to me. It’s your soul, so put 
your soul into it. 
If it can move you, then you can move others, but it’s got to get you going 
first. If it gets you going, then you can convey that, that’s what makes it fun. 
That’s what gives you the energy as a performer. If you’ve got it in you, you 
can give it out to them and everybody’s going to have a good time. Yep. I’ve 
been on one of these rides before, but I was very young and foolish.
Everybody up here is sleeping very, very deeply.
How do we go onto the next routine, because right now we have 
background music playing? 
Okay, so after I say sleep, then this music comes back up it’s about 50% 
down. It’s just some little ditty in the background, that’s a transition between 
routines. There again, find something that you like. 
I’m going to get into more of the mechanics of working with the DJ because 
you have all this stuff and it’s coordinated. As soon as one thing’s done, 
[
]

237
you’re blending into the next routine. It all becomes automatic and it all 
becomes very natural so you’re just flowing.
Is anybody in here a DJ or ever DJ’d? Okay, cool so you know what it’s like. 
Do the scratching thing. If you’ve got a Mac, go get a DJ program. It’s very 
easy to use iTunes and if you’re a PC person, get a Mac!
Laughter
I should have stock in that company for all the times I talk about a Mac. 
So we have this music going in the background between routines and I get 
the audience reaction. Give them a powerful round of applause. You give 
them a round of applause and say cool, this is a lot of fun.
Applause

Warm Up 2: Big Band
In a moment, I’m going to count to three. On number three, you guys 
are going to be in a band. You’re going to be playing instruments. 
When the music begins, pick your favorite instrument, and you’re 
going to be playing in the band.
And that will be number five. You can just hold up your hand when you’re 
ready to make that transition because I like to do everything smoothly. 
Even when I’m working with a DJ, I’m always watching them to make sure 
that we’re on cue. 
On number three, sit up in your chairs. You guys are in a band 
playing your favorite instrument 1-2-3, play that instrument right now. 
Play that instrument. 
Give it up for them, you guys. Come on. 
Applause
Come on, play that instrument. Come on. That’s right. Play that 
guitar. Oh yeah, play that trombone. Play that trombone. There you 
go. Give it up. Play that guitar. Come on get on the drums, man. 
You’ve got to play the drums. Get the drums going. Come on, make 
those drums really go. Make those drums happen. There you go. Let 
it happen, guys. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Stand up and really go for it. 
Get down baby. Whew. Oh yeah. Play that trombone, baby. Come 
on, play your instrument. Come on play. Get up there and play with 
everybody. Show us how you play those drums, man. Come on, play 
those drums. There you go… 
And freeze!
Okay, you can add a little flare in there. You can just say freeze and 
everybody’s like mannequins and they’re frozen. It’s a nice touch in the 
show when you do something like that. 
Then, of course, you say freeze and you turn around like whoa, what’s 
going on? It’s like you don’t have any idea what’s happening you’re just as 
amazed as the audience is, like, what’s going on? This is crazy. 
The individual I’m touching right now wake up. Hey, what are you 
doing?
Playing bass guitar.

Hey, my dear, wake up, wake up. What do you have in your mouth?
Uh, a trombone. 
It looks like very nice one. Okay. Have a seat.
Give her a round of applause, too.
Applause
Notice I said earlier that I am not a comedian, but you can look at people 
and you can throw things in there, little one-liners that are fun. People can 
read into whatever they want from their own life experience. That’s what 
makes it kind of goofy, so have fun with it. 
Hey Linda, wide awake hey, what are you doing? Are you having a 
good time?
Yeah.
You really are, aren’t you? Yeah, come here. Sleep! There you go.

Individual Routines
Now listen, in just one minute, I’m going to count to three. On 
number three, open your eyes, feeling fantastic in every way. But 
right now, you can’t open your eyes. Whenever I ask you your name, 
you won’t remember your name. You’ve lost your mind. You’ve lost 
your name. It doesn’t come out of your head. You’ve lost your name. 
You’ve absolutely forgotten your name. You don’t know what it is. 
In fact, if you try to say your name, your mind just goes blank, your 
throat locks up and you forget your name. It’s just that simple. On the 
count of three, open your eyes, feeling fantastic 1-2-3, wide awake.
Hey, do you know what? I need to set you down over here because 
you keep wobbling around. Can you have a seat over here? Very 
cool, thank you. Okay, good. 
What am I doing? I’m trying to set the stage for later. Do I have to ask her 
anything now? No, because I’m just setting some things up that I want to 
present later in the demonstration. 
Have a seat, my friend. Thank you. What are you doing up there? 
I don’t know.
You don’t know? Very good. 
Wide awake Patrick, wake up. How are you doing? 
Yeah. 
Are you okay?
Yeah.
What are you doing what’s in your hand? 
I don’t know.
You don’t know? It looks like a joint, so here have a seat. 
He’s still holding onto that that’s kind of crazy. Oh boy. He even looks like 
he’s a little out of it.

Oh you know what your name tag’s missing, I forgot, what was your

live?
Ohio.
Yeah? Where are you at now?
Las Vegas.
Nice. Okay, what’s 5 + 5?
10.
Well, then she knows. And your name was…
Laughter
Isn’t that crazy? And sleep! Okay.
Applause
Its fun to throw in some little zingers like that, and you can use it right now 
or you can do other things. You can send it out into the audience, and then 
you can play with them later. It’s always fun to have these little things 
happening at all times to get all this different interaction because people are 
fascinated. It’s like, what? She can’t remember her name, really? 
It’s like the people she’s with are going, that can’t be so. She never acts like 
that. That’s crazy. This stuff must be real. They would never do that, but 
why are they doing that?
Stage hypnotists, listen to me. You have a lot of power on stage, but don’t 
be fooled by it. When I’m done here, I’m going to Montana and being a dad. 
This is my alter ego. When you’re a stage hypnotist you’ve got a lot of 
power and you have a lot of fun. Have an alter ego and have fun with it. 
But remember when you’re done with the stage to go home and be a real 
human being again, because that’s more important than coming up here 
and doing all of this. This just pays for me to have fun being a single dad. 
That’s all it does. That’s what’s most important to me as a stage hypnotist at 
this point in my life. 
Hey Michael, sleep! Way down deeper and deeper. Listen very 
carefully as you go deeper and deeper to sleep, for the rest of the 
day, whenever I ask you your name you’re going to forget your 
name, but you’re going to have a different one. It’s going to be the

name of a different female. Whenever I ask you your name, it’s the 
name of a different lady. It’s always a different name. 
Michael is no longer your name. Whenever I ask you your name, it’s 
the name of a different female. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen, 
but every time I ask you your name, it’s a different name of a 
different lady, wide awake. 
Okay, how are you doing? 
Good.
Debra, right?
Yeah.
Very good. Are you having a good time? 
Yeah.
Good. Nice to have you here, sleep! Now listen, I’m going to send 
you back out into the audience because you keep flopping over and I 
need a little bit more room up here. So I’m going to send you back 
out here to the audience, sleep! Wake up. I’m going to send you 
back out to the audience. 
Now listen very carefully. When I do, whenever you hear me say the 
word hypnosis, whenever you hear me say the word hypnosis, you’re 
going to jump up and you’re going to call me a fake because you 
think that there’s nothing real about hypnosis. 
Whenever you hear me say the word hypnosis, you’re going to get 
up and call me a fake. You think that hypnosis is nothing but 
fraudulence, and that I’m nothing more than a fraud. That’s it. I’m just 
a fraud. 
Sit up, wide awake. Debra, hey wake up. Listen dear, I’m trying to do 
a show here and you keep falling over and going to sleep and I can’t 
have that. There are other people out there that will probably make 
better use of the chair here, so I’m going to send you back out to the 
audience. Is that okay?
Uh huh.
All right. Give her a round of applause. Make her feel good.

Thank you. Did you see how I grabbed her head and helped her off the 
stage? It will either be me doing that or an assistant because when they 
leave the stage area, we want to take care of their safety. We want to make 
sure they get back down to wherever they’re going. Depending on what 
routine you’re doing, you may send them back to where they were or you 
may put them in a specific chair, depending on how you’re framing the 
whole situation. 
Are you still doing good over there, Patrick?
Yeah.
Right on. Are you having a good time?
Yeah. 
And your name was…
Melissa.
Melissa. Cool. I like that name, Melissa. Wait a minute. What was 
your name?
Michelle. Okay, I like that. 
Laughter and applause
Wide awake. Wake up, wake up, wake up. I’m trying to do a show. 
Stop that. What was your name again? 
And your name was… And you are…
Samantha.
Samantha. Well, I’ll tell you, the things that happen when you do 
hypnosis, folks. 
FAKE!

FAKE!
Debra, sit down. I’m trying to do a show up here. What is your 
name?
Miranda.
Laughter
Miranda, okay. 
So, do you see where I’m going with this? When you’re doing stage shows, 
we’ve got our first guest down, I am already looking for people that I can 
use individually for separate routines. You do group routines, then you do 
individual routines and that’s what makes it a lot of fun for the audience. 
That’s why they come to see you – the extremely powerful, confident, 
competent stage hypnotist – and pay you big money.  
Yes. 
All right. My only goal here is to make you rich. All right, you’re welcome.
Good man.
I will send you an email with my tithing amount.
And you are…
Uh.
Forget about it go to sleep. Listen very carefully I’m going to tell you 
who you are. The next time I ask you who you are, you still don’t 
know your name, but you speak only in an alien language. You 
speak only in an alien language. You no longer speak the English 
language, but you speak an alien language, which is a series of 
bleeps, blurps, blups, whatever they are, but you only speak in an 
alien language. 

245
Wide awake my dear. So anyway, as we were talking about 
earlier…
FAKE!
Debra, I’m trying to do something up here. Can you just sit down and 
chill? Pretty soon I’m going to send Samantha, Miranda, Melissa or 
whatever her name is down there and she’s going to have a word 
with you. Wow! That’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen.  
Hey Patrick, sleep! Listen very carefully. I know you’ve got one good 
arm and that’s all you need to be a Sheriff, okay? That’s all you need 
to be a Sheriff is that one good arm, buddy. It’s the best arm ever. I 
mean that arm is not just an arm, it is a gun. I mean it’s a big gun. 
You’re a big gunned armed guy and you can do anything you want 
with this big gun. 
We’re talking just about your arm. That’s the big gun. So right now, 
sleep. Sleep very deeply and you’re going to be the big gunned one-
armed Sheriff. Wide awake. Okay, good. 
So what I’m doing now is I’m framing for a new skit. I keep setting up these 
frames. I like to play with my audience and my subjects. I like to get close 
up and personal because it’s a lot of fun to do that. That’s why I like 
hypnosis.
FAKE!
Debra, I’ve had enough of you, sleep!
And that’s how you take care of people like that.
Applause
It looks really good, but you interject all these sayings when you’re doing 
these skits. You just interject them so that you set the pace for what the rest 
of the show is going to be like and there are so many different things that 
we’re going to get into later.
Oh boy, I don’t know why she keeps falling asleep. 
Up. Linda, come up here for a minute would you please? Can you do 
me a favor? She keeps falling down and going to sleep and it’s just 
bothering me. A minute ago we were on the beach having a good 
time and here she is falling asleep. Can you tell her to wake up?

we’re going to move onto the next routine. I’ll count to three, wide

What’s everyone laughing at?
Hello, Sheriff. 
Hi.
How are you doing?
Good.
You know I’m having some problems up here with some of these 
people. What do have there?
My big gun.
That is your big gun, isn’t it? What are you going to do with it?
I might have to shoot somebody.
I’ll tell you what, the next time one of these people get out of line, I 
want you to go ahead and just shoot them with it and you watch what 
happens. They’re going to go to sleep as soon as you shoot them 
with that arm, that gun, that one-armed long gun of yours they’re 
going to go to sleep do you know that? Do you want to see how it 
works? 
I’d like to take out that woman there first, that Linda woman. How do 
like that?

Your name?

Everybody sit back in your chairs take a deep breath and sleep! Way 
down. There you go. 
I always put people to sleep before I do the next routine. Of course, we 
have music in the background between routines– our little ditty– By the time 
we get to your show on Sunday, guys, it’s going to be tight.

Warm Up 3: Horse Race
In a moment, I’m going to count to three. At number three, you’re 
going to sit in your chairs and we’re going to go to the races. You 
guys are all going to be on a horse. We’re going to have a good time. 
Before you get on that horse, though, what I want you to do is just go 
ahead and grab onto the reins if you would, please. Hold onto the 
reins. Grab the reins. There you go. 
Now, watch what I’m doing. I’m saying, right now reach out and grab the 
reins. I want to make sure I’ve got some really good responsive people up 
there. If they’re not grabbing the reins they may not be the best subjects. So 
I’m watching at all times. 
Grab the reins. Get ready. On number three, we’re going to go ride. 
We’re going to go for that race. Get ready now. I’m going to give you 
a number– number one, number two, number three, number r and 
number 5. 
Get ready on number three. When the music begins, I want you to 
ride that pony. Ride that pony as hard as you can. Make sure your 
stuck in your chair. That pony will not leave the stage. Get ready 
now. 1-2-3, ride that horse! Keep on riding that horse. Come on, let it 
go. Come on, ride that horse. There you go. 
Come on number two. Go number two. Go on number one faster and 
faster number one. Go number one. Go number three. Go, go, go. 
Here comes number four riding that horse. There you go. Come on 
number five. Hurry. There you go. 
Keep on going number three faster and faster. Come on, reach down 
there and give that horse a hug. Give your horse a hug. It’s working 
hard for you. There you go. Slap it on the butt. Slap it on the butt. Oh 
there you go. Nice. Give it a little kiss. It’s working hard for you. Give 
it a kiss. There you go. Yeah, ride that horse. Sit back on your horse 
now. Come on, get it going.
The race is on. The race is on. Here comes number one, number 
two, number three. Number three is coming down faster and faster. 
Number two to the side. Number two, keep over. Oh watch out, 
number two. Number two get number three out of the way. Push him 
over just a little bit. Push him over.
Come on number four. Get number three out of the way. Push 
number three over. Come on. Come on. Get her out of the way. 
Come on. Get some reaction. There you go. 

251
Come on. Get him out of the way. Come on. You know you want to 
get that prize because the prize is out there in front of you. The race 
is out there. There you are. There you are. 
You’re getting to the finish. You’re getting to the finish. The first one 
to the finish is going to win $1 million. You want to get it. Reach out 
there. Reach out there. Get your horse’s head out there. Come on. 
You’re going to win by a nose. There you go. Here you go. And 
sleep! Way down.
Give them a round of applause. Make them feel good.
Applause
So, another little example of the fun that we can have. You’re limited only 
by your own creative imagination. In a little bit, you too will be doing this for 
people riding a horse. Even you will be on a horse yourself. Who wants to 
go for a horse ride? Wanna ride the pony? Okay, very good it’s the same 
thing.
After you’ve done your preshow and you begin your routines, this is what 
we’re going to do for the rest of the evening. We’re going to go from one 
routine to another. Between each routine, you’ve got music playing in the 
background so there’s no dead space. 
As you’re doing your set-up here, you’re picking out people that you want to 
use one-on-one. So you’re giving them a pre-hypnotic suggestion. You’re 
either working on them here, or you’ll take a couple people and you’ll put 
them out here in the audience so you can play with them out there because 
everybody likes to see somebody coming out next to them. 
Are you okay, Patrick? Do you know everybody? Relax. Let yourself 
relax down. Just sleep. Go inside and become nice and peaceful 
inside. There you go. Relax comfortably. There you go everything 
nice, loose and relaxed, very comfortable inside and breathing easy. 
There you go.
I noticed he was breathing a little bit funny. I’m going to always watch out 
for my volunteers. You guys need to do that also because you never know 
where a person’s coming from. It was probably no big deal, but still, there’s 
always something in your mind going, are you breathing right? Is there 
something going on? 
Always- always- always take care of your subjects no matter what you do, 
because sometimes you can do some routines that were very fast and high-
paced and might be over the energy level for some people. So you always 
[
]
Spencer:

252
have to be cautious about that. Also when you’re picking subjects to do 
specific routines, you’ve got to be very careful about that. 
In a moment, I’m going to count to three. I don’t know if you guys can 
be any more hypnotized than this, but listen very carefully. For the 
rest of the day, you’re going to enjoy telling everyone what a 
fantastic time you had coming up here and getting hypnotized. 
You’re going to have a fantastic time going out there into the world 
and telling everybody what a fantastic time you had learning stage 
hypnosis and you’re going to tell them who taught you, and you’re 
going to enjoy telling everybody to visit our websites. 
Okay, I’m going to count to three. Open your eyes, wide awake. All 
this applause is for you 1-2-3, wide awake everybody.
Applause

feel good

Q&A Session
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
All right, so we’ve gone through some routines here and we’ve played with 
them a little bit. What I’d like to do is open it up for the next few minutes for 
some questions. I’m sure that some of you have some questions on what 
on Earth I’m doing? There’s one guy right there, please stand up.
I have a question around safety. Basically, you thought this fellow was 
breathing abnormally. 
Would you actually get the person out of trance first before making sure the 
person is okay or do you still keep them in trance?
No, I’d rather have the person in trance and give him a direct suggestion to 
be calm, cool and relaxed because you’re talking to the unconscious mind, 
much more effective. The hypnotist is perfect for emergencies because 
you’re dealing with the unconscious mind. 
One time I came upon an accident. I’ve told this story before. I had one of 
my sons with me. This has been years ago. We came upon an accident. It 
was in the wintertime. This little Volkswagen Bug had run into the back of 
this truck, this flatbed, and it went into the back window of the truck and 
smashed through. This woman who was driving it, it cut her open and her 
top lip was just hanging down. Her teeth were all jutted back and blood was 
just dripping everywhere.
My son said dad, are you going to stop and help her. I said, no. The 
paramedics will be here. He goes, dad, no, you’ve got to stop and help her, 
so I said okay. We stopped and we were the first ones on the scene, so I 
got out of the car and she was obviously in shock.
I just said, look at me. Listen very carefully. Because I know she’s already 
in a hypnotic state of mind. Blood stop flowing! You are calm and 
comfortable. Everything inside is becoming calm and comfortable right now. 
The blood is stopping. Everything is easy and soft.
The blood stopped and all the sudden she went from screaming like crazy 
to ahhh. Okay? You guys have some amazing gifts. Being a stage 
hypnotist, you’re going to learn things that nobody else will learn. You can 
be a hypnotist – a clinical hypnotist – but you’re going to learn more things 
by doing stage work than you could ever imagine possible. Trust me on 
this.

254
It’s so amazing the things that you’ll be able to do to help people because 
your confidence will all the sudden really begin to skyrocket with the skills 
that you’re learning through what you’re doing over these four days. You 
can take and transfer these out there on the street in real life emergencies if 
you need to, realizing that you’re not a medical doctor and that I’m not 
offering treating, diagnosing or curing. But the things you can do, you can 
be very, very helpful.
Any other questions? Yes, right there?
Another question about a safety issue. When it comes to making people 
imagine that they’re smoking dope, what about if someone has had, say, 
atenolol, and that could trigger and asthma attack on stage?
If they had what?
What if that could trigger an asthma attack on stage?
Anything is possible, and that’s why I say, whether you’re a stage performer 
or whatever, I mean anything is possible, and that’s why I always stress –
listen, always pay attention to your subjects and watch them. I mean we 
can’t predict what’s going to happen ever. Even in a class like this or any 
kind of training, we can never predict. All we can do is just watch and notice 
and do our best to offer support to another human being.
Would that be something that we could use in our pre-talk to the audience, 
so people who have an illness or people who are pregnant not to get up as 
volunteers?
You can use that in the pre-talk. If I see somebody that comes up here and 
they’re a small child or they’re pregnant, I’m going to say, well, I think that 
you’ve already had a good time, so I’m going to send you back to the 
audience.
Laughter
Okay. Thank you. Thanks.
Because I don’t want a pregnant woman up here. I really don’t. So there are 
things that you’ll learn that you can be very tactful about. She wants to be 
up there. Say, I really congratulate you for wanting to come up here, but 
you’re going to feel much safer out here. Okay?
Before you release everybody, is it ever necessary to cancel any of the 
suggestions?

Is it necessary to cancel any of the suggestions? No. Yes. Yes. No. Well, 
here, listen, people always ask, man if you hypnotize somebody, is it going 
to stick forever? Obviously not, but it could but not the way that you think. 
Usually what happens is that after you’re done with the show, pretty soon 
people will go whew and come back to their senses because this is just like 
a big dream up here anyway. 
I always at the end of the show – we haven’t even got to that part yet – I’ll 
always end the show with:
In a moment, I’m going to count from 1-5. I will say wake up and then 
you’re going to feel fantastic in every way. All suggestions are now 
removed, except for just a couple. One of those suggestions I’m 
going to leave you with is that you can tell all your friends what a 
fantastic time you had coming out to the hypnosis show, and you’re 
going to invite them to come back over and over again and to visit 
my website.
All right. These are things that I do. The second suggestion is I always give 
my subjects up here positive motivation because they put it all out here by 
coming up here. So I give them a gift and that gift that is the other 
suggestion that I will let them keep if they choose to. So it’s a positive 
suggestion. Maybe they want to stop smoking or lose weight or have more 
confidence, more success. So I try to instill something valuable for them for 
coming up there and volunteering. 
Okay and your next question would be…
My question is, when you put these people to sleep, in terms of their 
physical gesture, if it’s an uncomfortable one, it’s very easy to let them go 
out of hypnosis because it’s uncomfortable.
Do your question is if I have people up here and they’re laying across each 
other and if they’re uncomfortable, will that cause them to come out of 
hypnosis? Is that the question?
Yes.
Yes, they can. Not always, but they can. There again, I’m watching them. 
So I’m going to notice. If I think a person is uncomfortable – yes you were a 
little bit yesterday.  
This morning.
This morning. The days are all running together. But when you’re doing a 
show, you’re going to watch all this. When you’re doing a show, you’re 
going to notice that probably everybody is just there. They’re just all on top 
of each other having a good time, so you’ll watch them it’s the same thing. 

256
You watch out for their comfort level because it can. I’ve heard people say 
well, I was doing really good until that person touched me. Then I kind of 
popped out of it. Then they don’t go back into trance. I just invite them off 
the stage. 
You let them off, or do you try to resolve the issue by readjusting and stuff?
It depends on what I’m noticing at the moment. I mean that’s kind of a 
judgment call that you’re going to have to make, that I make every time. If 
it’s something simple, I may just readjust people and just say sleep and put 
them back so they don’t feel uncomfortable. Or, if I think by looking at them 
that it’s going to be a problem. Then I might say, you know what, I think 
you’ll have more fun out in the audience. Thank you very much for coming 
up here.
Okay. Can I have a quick second question, just out of my own curiosity? 
When you asked Michael to come up with all these female names, a lot of 
them come with an ‘M’ to start. Does that anything to do with the fact his 
name is Michael?
Does it have anything to do with it? I don’t have a clue, actually. 
Right here, yes? Do you have a microphone?
I was wondering, I forget what his name is, the guy that didn’t have a name 
tag. He didn’t seem like he was responsive and animated as the other 
participants. Would that be kind of the person you’d want to maybe ease off 
stage and back into the audience.
And I’m so glad that you asked, and I’m so glad that you noticed that. Who 
else noticed that? Yeah. Most of you noticed that. And did you notice I 
didn’t really do much with him? I just played around it because sometimes 
it’s better just to keep somebody up there and work around him, instead of 
just dismissing him in the middle of what you’re doing. 
I’m glad you guys noticed that, and that’s an excellent question. Good 
observation. 
Yeah, my question has to do with the arrangement of the skits. I was just 
wondering whether or not – do you start with easier skits because it 
seemed like, by going up you’re going to have like amnesia, when you did 
your thing, it started like hot and cold or do you just go and start anywhere? 
Make an easy one, kind of like build their hypnotic trance up until you get it 
right. Like you don’t know your name or…

Experience will be your best teacher. I mean that’s the best answer I have 
for you. I mean you’re going to have some groups of people where you can 
do absolutely anything with, and it doesn’t matter what the order is. 
That said, what I do in my shows is I always do two or three things as a 
group first. I usually always do two or three things as a group because 
when you get the group going together, this group dynamic, it makes it 
easier for people to now be individually sought out and utilized. 
So I will always do a group thing because that way the pressure’s on. We’re 
all doing this, and they all feel good about it. Then, of course, the more a 
person responds to a suggestion or an idea, what happens? 
They turn into a star?
They turn into a star, yeah. But each time that you give a person an idea 
and they act upon it, it makes it easier for them to accept successive 
suggestions. Every time you give a person a suggestion in hypnosis and 
they respond, they just go even deeper into trance. 
So the order is not that important. There again, that will come with 
experience. For example, if you’re doing a high school graduation night. 
High school kids, easy. You can do whatever you want with them. You can 
go, sleep! They’ll drop like butterflies.
So there are a lot of variations. Corporate crowds, it’s going to be a little bit 
different. There again, experience. So the more people that you’ve got, the 
easier it’s going to be for you to determine what you’re going to do. 
I have a routine that I follow. I have my skits that I do in every show. That’s 
what I do. I’ve done it for years. I love it, and it just works. I’m not going to 
reinvent my own wheel, but I reinvent a lot of my presentation because 
times are changing. A lot of the stuff is the same thing. It works for me. It’s a 
natural flow. I can do it in my sleep. And within the routines that I have, I 
have a lot of different variations that I can go off into.
So if I’m doing something and I’m thinking, oops, this is getting the kind of 
response I want, then I just simply switch and do something else. If I can’t 
go in the front door, I’m going to go into the back door. If the back door 
doesn’t work, I’m going to go into the side door. However I can get them.
Is it possible that a person may not be able to act out or experience 
something you’re suggestion. Let’s say if somebody has never been drunk. 
Let’s say somebody’s never done pot. Let’s say whatever. What will 
happen? Will that person maybe come out of the trance? Will they just sit 
there and go, duh!

258
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
One of two things will happen. 
Everybody has seen somebody drunk or stoned. That’s kind of a no brainer. 
Even if you’ve never had the experience, most of us have seen somebody 
on TV. You can’t get away from it in the United States of America. Foreign 
countries, you can. But here, you can do whatever you want so people have 
had that experience, so they know what it looks like and they can emulate 
it. 
Now there will be different cultures that you go to or different streams of 
society where it’s not appropriate. For example, I was doing a show and 
everybody was following along really good with everything that I did. This 
one lady was fantastic and I thought, oh, I’m going to use her because 
she’s cool. I was doing this routine and everybody’s going to get a drink. 
There you go. Have a drink. She goes, I’m sorry, but it’s against my religion. 
She’s a good Mormon woman, but it was against her religion. Now other 
Mormons may have been a little naughtier than her, but for her, she was 
sticking to her vows and covenants, which is awesome. So that was cool. I 
said, okay. Have a soda instead.   
There again, improvise, improvise, improvise. Any other questions on what 
we’ve been doing? Yes?
Just as a standard, you talked about a $5,000 show, or a $10,000 show. 
How long is your show, and how many…
As quick as possible to get the most amount of money as I can.
Just as a parameter. I mean you’ve got to give them at least an hour or an 
hour and a half, I guess. Also how many skits might you go through in a 
standard show?
It depends. I have about 50 routines that I have. I go through maybe about 
16 or 17. 
In how much time?
I give myself anywhere between 60 and 75 minutes max. No more than 
that. Why don’t you want to do it longer then that? Because people don’t 
have an attention span for something longer then that. If you get up there 
and do a show, sizzle it, make it look hot and then get off the stage, man, 
and just let them drip for me. That was great! Come back for more.
If you draw it out too long, it just can become boring. I had a conflict when I 
was doing a show at the theater because this guy, man, he just really 
irritated me, but he wanted me to do half the show, and then he wanted to 

259
take an Intermission for like 20 minutes so he could sell popcorn and 
concessions right, and then do the other half of the show. 
I did it. It didn’t matter. I didn’t care. Everybody was on stage and at 
Intermission time, I just said, and sleep! I made sure they were all laid out 
on the floor. So they were all just laying on the floor sleeping for about 10 or 
15 minutes. 
I went to the back room and had a drink and some popcorn and stuff like 
that. Everybody had their thing. Then I’d go back and change my clothes. 
I’d come back on stage and I just framed it so it was nice. So when 
Intermission was over, I’m back up there. The lights come back on and we 
had this music playing.
Then I say, are you guys ready to get back on with the show? We’re going 
to have a great time. In just a moment, I am going to count to three. At 
number 3, the music will begin. Everybody on the floor get up off the floor 
and you will begin to respond to whatever the suggestion was at that point. 
You can do it. I don’t recommend it, but when you do a show for 6 ½ solid 
years, every Saturday night, you learn a lot of skills and a lot of things you 
can do that really makes things different for what you’re doing – the 
dynamics of doing a show for groups. 
You mentioned before that often you can’t see out into the audience 
because of the lights. So how are you picking people based on 
suggestibility tests? I mean how does that work if you can’t see what’s 
going on in the audience?
Well, I don’t need to see what’s going on in the audience. I mean I just have 
them put their hands up. I say, if you’re hands are stuck and if you want to 
have fun, come up to the stage. 
Then again, if you take that a little bit further, when I have everybody up 
here, they’re sleeping and I’m doing the induction and people are out there 
in the audience, some may be going to sleep. I’ll say if there’s anybody out 
there – if it’s a lighting issue –that appears to be in hypnosis next to you, 
please raise your hand. 
Then I have this coordinated with the lighting director, and they bring the 
house lights up about halfway, so I can look out and see what’s happening. 
Then when the show goes back on, the lights come down and we just want 
the lights right here on the stage. All the focus is right here on the stage, on 
you and on your subjects.
Applause Thank you.

Naughty Routines
Spencer:
Let me talk about one girl here that you haven’t met yet. Her name is 
Bonnie, and she is my blow-up doll. People ask about a little bit more risqué 
things. So let me address that because people want to know about it. I’m 
not here to teach a risqué show, but whenever you get to do a show, if you 
want to be a little bit more risqué, you can do that.
Let me give you, from my experience over the last 20 odd years of doing 
stage hypnosis shows around the world and doing entertainment, if you do 
a show that attracts all audiences, you’ll have more fun and you’ll make 
more money.  
That said, I do have Bonnie, she’s a blow-up doll. I dress her in clothes, it’s 
kind of fun routine. It doesn’t have to be a naughty routine, but it’s kind of 
fine because people will see the blow-up doll, and immediately their mind 
gets naughty because of the blow-up doll, and her name’s Bonnie. She 
wears a mini skirt, and she’s kind of cute. 
So anyway, I’ll bring her up on stage and I’ll say, 
Listen, in a moment, I’m going to count to the three. I’ve got this 
beautiful woman up here. Open your eyes. It’s like the person I’m 
touching right now, you want to dance with her so bad, and she’s like 
the cutest thing ever. You really want to be with her. She’s hot. 
Then I’ll say 1-2-3 and the music will play, and I’ll be sitting here talking to 
this blow-up doll, and they’re all back there watching me. Pretty soon this 
guy comes up there and he’s like, hey, hey, hey. I want to talk to her. So I 
can use a blow-up doll in that kind of routine in any kind of setting and keep 
it clean and fun.
If I see somebody starting to overboard, then I’ll just say, whoa, hands off, 
sleep! Just change the mood very quickly so that I don’t offend people. But 
you can go to a certain level of non-offensiveness with just about anything 
and have fun and keep it clean at the same time. 
The most successful people are the ones who keep their shows clean. So I 
really want to emphasize that. If you do that, you’re going to have a good 
time. There are people out there who are the XXX hypnotists and stuff like 
that. Some people like that. Pick your battles wisely. If you want to be rich 
and successful and make more money than anybody else in this business, 
keep it clean. Have a good time. The most successful person here in Las 
Vegas, not a hypnotist, was always a clean act. Just a little heads up for 
you on that.

If you’re doing a gig for a corporate environment, I mean I wouldn’t talk 
about smoking weed or something like that in there. So I’m sure you have a 
list of skits that you would do besides the ones that you did tonight?
Oh yeah, we have more skits that we’re going to go into. Yeah, definitely. 
There again, what I said earlier was when somebody books me, they send 
me an email and say, I want to hire you buddy boy. You look like the guy for 
us. I say, cool. Then I talk to them on the phone – and we’ll get into the 
business aspect tomorrow on how to book gigs and how to talk to your 
clients.
My question is like, okay, well, what kind of a show do you want? This is 
your show. It’s your money. I give them options– G, PG, PG17, R– you tell 
me. I let them tell me. Then I do that kind of show because they’re paying 
the money. 
Yes, Jay?
Yeah, so you actually my mind moving a little bit more with regards to the 
blow-up doll.
Laughter
What other props would you suggest that we use?
Well, I think Bonnie’s enough for you.
Laughter
Don’t tell my wife.
I’m going to tell your wife. I’ll probably sit by her on an airplane again. I use 
a lot of different props. A lot of props I use depending on the routine. Maybe 
I’ll have a couple of guys dancing together, and get some of those feather 
boas and put them on them and make them foo foo kind of guys, and just 
have fun like that.
Maybe I’ll put a wig on somebody and turn them into some kind of other 
character. Maybe I’ll give them a plastic air guitar to play or drumsticks or 
whatever. There again, you’re only limited by your own creative 
imagination. 
I can tell you everything I can do, or you might learn better just by using 
your own creative imagination and thinking, what could I do if I could? If I 
could do anything I wanted to do, what would I do? If I could be anything I 
wanted to be on stage, who would I be? Get crazy with it. Have fun. Maybe 

262
you want to be – I am Jake with Bonnie the Blow-up Doll as my sidekick. 
She will hypnotize you. Look into her eyes, and only her eyes. 
So there are a lot of things that you can frame in a way that’s fun and still 
safe for people. Any other questions? No, wow! Have you guys learned 
everything you needed to learn in this segment?
No.
Then you haven’t asked enough questions. 
I misunderstood you. This is great!
Oh, there’s more to learn, we are not done by a long shot. We just keep 
building and building and building and building and building, and it will not 
collapse. It will just continue to expand. 
I wanted to ask what would be the best route to take as far as like putting 
your own skit together. I know your imagination is the best way to go, but 
what would be a good way theme wise to start or even help us with that 
also. Like okay, can we sit down? Do we have exercises on putting our own 
thing together?
What we have is we have some specific exercises that we want you to go 
through because it’s going to be easier for you guys to get this if we have 
things already put together and I demonstrate. You’re going to see that 
what I demonstrated, you guys will get out there and do this also. I want you 
to be comfortable watching what I do and apply it to yourselves. Because 
you’ve seen it it’s like okay, I can do that. 
Then from there, man, let your imagination go crazy. 
Okay. That’s all I wanted to know.
So you could go to YouTube. Go to hypnotist shows. Do whatever you want 
to, to see what other people are doing and see what makes sense to you. 
Myself, I just used to watch comedy shows all the time and watch 
comedians. They were always kind of goofy. Their minds work goofy. So I 
hung around with a lot of comics.
In the early days, I’d always work with comics. They would be an opening 
act for me, and then I’d be the headliner. We’ll talk more about that in the 
business aspect of it. You know, when you go out there and you want to 
book yourself because you’re never an opening act hypnotist. 
The hypnotist is not an opening act. You are the headliner. You’re the 
headliner; you ain’t opening act. You ain’t no 20-minute skididdle out there. 
You’re the big honcho when you get out there.

How do you decide who does what?
How do I decide who does what?
Yeah.
I’m the conductor. This is my orchestra, and it’s up to me to determine who 
plays the drums and who plays what. For example, in the band, I just said, 
you’re in a band and you’re all playing an instrument. You pick the 
instrument you wanted. You had the trombone thing going. You wanted the 
big trombone. 
But for the other, like the individual skits, was there – did you just pick, or 
were you looking for certain things to decide who was going to do which 
individual little bit?
Well, I always look for that person who I think is going to be a lot of fun and 
be very animated. So I’m always looking for the number one because you 
may have a group of people up here, and may have some people who are 
good and some who are maybe not as good. So I’m going to be looking for 
the very best subjects to do all the different skits with. So that’s what I’m 
looking for.
Other than that, there’s no rhyme or reason for it. It depends on the routine. 
If the routine calls for two women, or a woman and a man, or a man, or two 
men or whatever, I’ll pick according to whatever my skit is at the moment. 
Other than that, it’s a free for all. It is a free for all in the mind. 
Any other questions are we done? We have 30 seconds? Oh, we’re done. 
You’ve got five seconds.
Do you keep a cheat sheet up there?
Huh? How offended am I by that? Of course I do. No I don’t. No. No. I do 
have them memorized. I do have a sheet up there by my sound technician. 
They’ll have one, but they don’t even use that. They just use my computer. I 
just take my computer and everything’s on there. So they use the whole 
thing. But I’ve got everything in my mind. 
I’ve memorized it. So you memorize your own thing too because there’s 
nothing that looks worse than this. So be professional and work out the 
routines. I mean really, take the time to do it. We’ll go into that because 
even before I do a show, when I’m in the room with the DJ setting up, I go 
through the entire show in my mind with him, live, music playing, everything 
to make sure that he’s on cue with me, and that we’re on the same page. 

264
You’re going to get to a point where you will begin to have dreams of being 
a stage hypnotist. I’m wondering just by a raise of hands – and then you 
can get out of here for a break – how many people had dreams last night 
about being a stage hypnotist? Very cool. 
Here’s what one of my martial arts teachers told me. He said, when you 
begin to dream it, you become it. When you begin to dream it, it’s becoming 
absorbed inside of your body. It becomes a part of you.
So with that said, I am going to give you guys a boot for a few minutes. 
When you come back, we’ll have some more fun.

Practice Warm Ups
Welcome back, guys. How are you guys doing?
Great.
I’m not so convinced. How are you guys doing?
Great!
Excellent. Did you enjoy the last session?
Yes.
Did you learn a lot from it?
Yes.
Would you like to do it?
Yes?
Yes, No, Maybe. What is this? Do you want to do the same thing?
Yes!
What I want to do in this session here is to go step-by-step through the 
same thing you saw. Why? Because you’ve got the current experience for 
the field work to go with it. It does not mean that you have to be stuck with 
the same routines and just do that for the rest of your life. 
These are just training wheels to get used to the process of selecting things 
and going things and so on. Then what we’ll do from there, we’re start 
building into it so you can start finding your own routines. You can still have 
other routines and you can just mix and match, depending on the venue, 
the people you’re with and just what you feeling like doing as well. 
My aim is that by the end of today, you can pick up any book of stage 
hypnosis, any DVD on stage hypnosis, watch it and just go, I can do that, 
no problem. I can do it even better than that. Or better still, you’ll watch a 
TV show or a comedian like Spence does. You watch something and it 

266
inspires you and you go, you know what, you could have a fun dynamic 
going on here. 
Maybe you see two kids fighting on a bus and you go, that would be 
awesome to recreate on a stage because it’s hysterical. So now life starts 
inspiring you. But before you can get there, you need to have some 
experience of actually doing this stuff, which is what right now is all about. 
Are you guys good with that?
Yes!
Thank you. Whew. So go ahead and break back up into your groups – the 
13 groups from before. As soon as you’re sitting down, face the front again, 
which tells me that we’re ready to start beginning the whole cycle. Off you 
go.
So here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to be, basically, recreating 
the same experience you had up here a moment ago, but we’re going to be 
doing a dry run just to get the feel for doing the skits and so on. To make 
life easy, we’re going to pretend you’ve done the whole intro stuff, the stuff 
you did earlier today. 
So now you’ve basically, done the induction and you’re ready to roll. So 
Step 1, this is going to be the Warm-up Phase. I want you to set a scene. 
What is the scene that Spencer set? A beach, right? How can you set a 
scene, given the fact that you’re going to have about one minute to do this 
whole thing, including a skit?
Here’s a simple way. We’re going to take a trip to the beach. Are you 
ready? Is that setting the scene? It doesn’t take very long, does it? You 
don’t need to add, the cool waves washing away and the sun is shining. 
That’s a different context. If you want to do that, you do that during the 
induction, but you don’t do this now. 
1. Set the scene 
We want a beach. What was the second thing Spencer did? Any ideas? 
Anyone remember?
2. Seatbelts
Did you see how Spencer built the safety parameters into the skit? We’re 
going to the beach so you’ll get in the car, you better buckle up. Now you 
can just add a safety suggestion saying, every time you sit in that chair, 
you’ll be safely strapped in. You don’t leave the chair unless asked to move. 
Students:
Igor:

267
So you’re making it as a side comment in the scene setting. The audience 
won’t really know what’s going on, but of course, your panel, your 
volunteers will be responding to that and you create a bit of safety, while 
still creating the atmosphere that you want for the scene. 
What was the third thing he did?
We smoked dope.
You smoked dope. Okay folks, we’re going to have a great time now. Oh 
yeah.
Give them a choice.
Exactly. 
3. You give them a choice. 
In the skit that you’re going to do, you can give them a choice between 
getting drunk and getting stoned, just give them the whole experience. 
You’re on a beach, there’s a fire being lit, people are having a great time. 
Hey, have a drink and look there’s a joint; do you want to have a joint? Just 
take a toke. Enjoy it. So you‘re going to spend one minute getting them 
drunk or stoned, and that’s it.
Now to be a little bit more hypnotic about the whole thing, you have a group 
of five people, apart from you guys. Actually, we might be Debbie in with 
you guys just so you have six as well, and you can play it that way. 
So, you have a group of five people that are going to be your volunteers, 
just like Spencer had here. So I want you to do an instant induction on each 
one of them. That should hopefully take 10 seconds for the whole lot. 
Whack them in. Then, as soon as you put them into an induction, set the 
scene, set the safety parameters, get them drunk or stoned and start 
playing up the whole effect so they’ll start acting it out.
You only have one minute to do the whole thing, so you better get your 
skates on and really get these guys into what you’re doing. There’s only 
one thing I’ll add to this. 
If there’s a volunteer who’s not responding as fully as you’d like them to, tap 
them on the shoulder, wake them up and put them back in trance. Do it 
again, so you’re fractionating two or three times, and then reset exactly the 
same scene again if you have time to do that in that one minute segment. 
Student:
Igor:
Student:
Igor:

268
So now we’re walking pretty quickly, aren’t we? Rest assured you don’t 
have to do the whole fractionation, that’s just extra if you feel like it. This is 
the only thing we want to do. Is that easy?
Yes.
All right, folks. Where’s my watch? Here it is. Get yourself ready hypnotists. 
Oh, actually, do you know what? Seeing as we’ve just moved groups 
around a little bit, please redo numbers. Whoever just joined the group as 
the last number in the sequence, just make sure that everyone knows what 
numbers you guys are, just tell each other your number. 
Just to make this absolutely clear, we’ll pretend that we have, for the 
moment, no audience. They’re going to be behind you somewhere. So the 
people in your group are now the volunteers for your show. Does that make 
sense? 
You’re not going to go through any selection process or anything like that 
that’s all done now. You’ve even done the induction or you might do a quick 
induction now just to set the scene. You’re going straight into where we left 
off the last time you and I were working together. Does that make sense 
now? 
So we’re going to have no audience, just the panel and that’s the only 
people you’re working with. You’ll have 60 seconds to get this whole thing 
done. Hypnotist No. 1, please be ready. Everyone else please be seated. 
Your time starts now, off you go.
Give yourself a round of applause, folks.
Applause
You can do better than that. Come on.
Applause
Stay in your groups. How do you feel? 
Drunk.
I’m the world’s most wasted hypnotist. Sleep! 
Okay, settle down. There’s a question here.

Quick Exercise Demo
Student:
Igor:
We seem to be a little bit confused. Were we supposed to do an induction 
first and then go to the beach or just assuming that the induction’s already 
been done?
You’re going to do the instant induction you’re not going to do a full two- or 
three-minute induction. Just do everyone an instant 1-2-3-4-5, if I can 
demonstrate for a moment.
Hi, how are you doing? Sleep! All the way down deeper, deeper. 
Relax. That’s right. 
Sleep! All the way. Deeper and deeper. 
Sleep! All the way. Deeper and deeper.
Hi. Sleep! All the way. That’s right. Good.
How are you doing? Sleep! All the way. Deeper and deeper. Good.
You, step aside. Sleep! All the way. 
How are you doing? Ready? Sleep! All the way. Deeper and deeper. 
Now I have them pretty much there. All I’m going to do now is tell them 
we’re ready to go to the beach. 
While we’re going to the beach, put your belts on. That’s right, 
seatbelts on. We’re going to have a nice little trip to the beach. 
Ready for this- 1-2-3- wide awake. 
Ha ha. No more beach. It doesn’t take very long.

How To Make Transitions
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
Student:
Igor:
Arthur:
Igor:
Are you all good with this?
Yes.
We’re going to do the same thing again. This time, we’ll start with the same 
process instant induction. Have everyone lying in their chair. It will take you 
probably about 10 seconds to do the whole row. So you’ll have another 50 
seconds to do a bit of a skit with these guys. 
What we’re going to do now is do two skits back to back, so you get the feel 
for transitioning between warm-up routines. The two skits we’re going to 
use, again, you’ve seen them up here already are:
1. The Big Bandstand where they’re all playing instruments.
2. The Horse Races and you can encourage them to whip their horses, 
kiss their horses, hug them, go faster and make a race out it. So a 
day at the races.
We will be playing the music for you. We’ll switch the music for you. When 
the music switches, you switch scenes. Does that make sense? Does 
everyone understand what they’re doing? Go ahead?
Spencer had them stand up with their instruments. Do you want us to do 
that?
No, keep them in their seats for now, just so you get used to this whole 
process. We’ll do standing skits afterwards so you get used to maneuvering 
people when they’re standing separately. It just keeps life a lot easier for 
you at this point where you just want to make it nice and easy, and then 
we’ll build up from there. 
Arthur has a question first. Go ahead, Arthur.
Does the music have to be so loud it’s hard to hear the hypnotist?
To some extent, we have to turn it up; otherwise, everyone in the room 
won’t hear it. Its part of what you have to deal with in a stage show. The 
bonus of a stage show is that you’ll have a microphone. Here, you’ll have to 
just get in close and just project, so make sure that you get in close.
If someone’s not responding, just get in closer and make sure that they 
hear you, so you’re playing with the group. It will happen for real as well. 
You’ll have people over here, you’ll say something and people will miss it. 

271
So you’ll have to come back up and say, that’s right, you are Superman. 
Stand up now and be loud and proud, or whatever. 
This just gets you used to the stage a little more. There’s one promise I’ll 
make you guys. There’s one promise I can absolutely make you guys. If 
you decide to do any kind of show, which of course, on Sunday you will, I 
can guarantee you if something can go wrong, it will. At least something will 
go wrong, so you may as well just accept it and learn how to roll with it, 
rather than trying to have the perfect show where nothing will go wrong. 
It’s better to learn how to roll with it than to try to eliminate it. You eliminate 
it as best you can, and then you roll with the rest. All good?
Can we put them in a circle?
That’s fine. You can get in a circle. It’s all good. I mean you’ll play with it 
and you’ll come up with ideas. Remember, you’re the hypnotist. It’s your 
stage. If it’s not working for you, change it. All right everyone good? 
Please let’s have Hypnotist No. 1 up and ready. Hypnotist No. 1 begin.

Give yourself a round of applause, folks.

How much fun are you guys having?
A lot!
Just think of this, guys – Come back to me. Come back to me. Just think of 
this, folks. Very soon, you’ll be getting paid to enjoy yourself like this? Isn’t 
that something? Who here wants to get paid to have this much fun? It’s 
possible. That’s all this stage hypnosis thing is about, right? 
Okay, let’s take a deep breath. Calm down, calm down, calm down. Would 
it be fair to say that you’ve got a good handle on how to do an Introduction 
for the stage? Like your Introduction and the induction and all that sort of 
stuff, right, straightforward? 
Would it be fair to say you have a good handle on how to warm people up 
to be responsive as subjects, like you’ve just been doing now? Would that 
be fair to say? Yes or no? I don’t know.
Yes.
So now what I want to do is get to the main meat of your show, the main 
routines. Can you remember some of the main or the bigger routines, that 
one-on-one sort of stuff that Spencer was doing? What kind of things did he 
begin with?
Forget your name.
Forget your name. What else?
Send someone back to the audience.
Send someone back with an anchor, with a personal suggestion. What 
else?
Alien language.
Alien language and changing names. 

273
What we’re going to do now is play with the first three things that he was 
doing, which work quite nice as a routine on their own. We have three 
routines:
1. Forget your name.
2. Change your name every time you say it. Usually changed to the 
name of someone of the opposite sex.
3. Speak in an alien language. 
You can say speak Chinese and, of course, if there are some Chinese 
people in the room at that point, they probably will. So choose another 
language, like German or something that they’re unlikely to know. At that 
point, you’re going to get more of the comics and sounds out of it, or Alien 
of course.
The key thing here is, if you’re going to give them something like the Alien 
language and you say, you’re going to speak Alien, most people have no 
idea what that means. Notice the way Spencer introduced it was to give 
them an idea of what it means – you’ll bleep, blurp and make all kinds of 
sounds that are alien or foreign to you. 
So you give them some idea of what it is. If you’re particularly good with 
weird sounds, make a few weird sounds to kind of encourage them along 
the way while you’re presenting the suggestion. 
So this is what we’re going to do now. We’re going to practice the transition 
from the warm-up routine you’ve just been doing into a full blown one-on-
one type skit routine, which these three things are about. This is really what 
the meat of the show is about. 
Did you guys enjoy the Bandstand? It was kind of a fun one to do. So, what 
we’ll do is we’ll start the same way, instant induction with everyone. We’ll go 
into the Bandstand for maybe about 30 or 40 seconds. Then when the 
Bandstand music stops – there will be no music for these skits here – when 
the Bandstand music stops, I want you to put them back in trance.
1. We’ve got the warm-up.
2. Then you’ll put them back in trance as they’re transitioning. 
3. Then you deepen it a little bit as well if you want, as a transitioning 
between Bandstand and some of the other stuff. 
Now whilst you’re doing the Bandstand and they’re all playing drums and 
the music and all the rest of it, you choose who you think is going to be fun 
to work with for the next section. If you choose wrong, it doesn’t matter. You 
can always change it halfway through. After all, this is your show.

274
So just choose someone who you want to get to forget their name. You 
have a couple of choices here. You can choose three people: one to forget 
their name; one to change their name; one to speak Alien. 
Or you can have one person forget their name first, and then follow it up by 
saying, oh, now you can have someone else’s name. In other words, you 
change your name every time. For a guy, it will be a girl’s name; or for a 
girl, it will be a guy’s name.
It’s entirely up to you what you do. You’re going to use three people or just 
two, and escalate the actual suggestions. Whichever way you want to play 
it is fine with me. The only thing you’re going to do is:
1. Induction
2. Bandstand trance
3. Skits or routines in silence 
Is that easy to do? Yes?
Yes.
Do you want a quick demo of this?
Yes.
All right. Can I have five volunteers up on the stage? Or actually just three 
will do. Three volunteers on the stage, please quickly. One more. Thank 
you very much. Have a seat here, here and here. Have a seat. Can I 
borrow your glasses? There you go. Very good. 
Okay, everyone just look at me.
And sleep! All the way. That’s it. 
And sleep! All the way. That’s right. All the way. 
And sleep! All the way. Deeper and deeper and deeper. Very good.
Everyone, we’re going to go and watch a great show, the Bandstand. 
In fact, you are the show. You’re going to enjoy yourselves so much. 
You’re going to show off all your talent, your favorite friends, your 
favorite movie stars and the audience. The better you play and the 
louder you play, the more they will love you. 
Are you ready? Pick up your instrument. And play away. Okay, make 
sure that you are the star performer here. The louder you play and 
the better you play, the more they will watch you, the more they will 
love you.
Everyone else, clap along.

Applause
And stop. 
Everyone sit back down. Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, all the way. Very 
good. So, speaking to you right now, in a moment, when I touch your 
shoulder, in a moment I’m going to wake you guys up and you’re 
going to find the strangest thing.
Whenever I ask your name, you simply won’t know. You will 
remember everything else about your life. You will remember 
everything else about the show. It’s just simply when I ask your 
name it’s escaped your mind. You don’t know what it is. It’s the 
strangest thing. It will be kind of funny to you in some ways. 
I’m going to touch you on the shoulder right now. Every time you 
speak, you’ll speak in an Alien tongue. You can understand me just 
fine, but you’ll be speaking in an Alien voice. There will be all kinds of 
bleeps and blurps and all kinds of strange sounds that no one else 
can understand but make perfect sense to you, nod your head if you 
understand– very good– 1-2-3 wide awake. 
So how are you guys doing?
Good.
Say again?
Biddle beep.

Each time I ask you though, the girl’s name will change. It will be

277
Everyone, sleep! Sleep! Sleep! All suggestions are removed now. 
You’ll have a fantastic time, especially when you go out there and be 
a hypnotist. You’re going to have such a great time. 
In fact, you’ll have a better time than your subjects, which means 
they’ll be infected by your sense of humor, by your life and what 
you’re doing. You might even find yourself inventing skits on the fly 
just because they’re fun. 
Nod your head if you understand. Okay, all other suggestions, apart 
from the fact that you are going to have the best time ever as you do 
the show. 1-2-3, wide awake ready to rejoin the audience.
Give them a round of applause.

Practice Your Routines
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
Okay, folks. Is that easy? You’ll have two minutes. The first minute will be 
the Intro stuff and the Big Band. Then when the music cuts, you’ll get to 
play with the audience a little bit with three skits, in any way you want to. 
Then we’ll come back and we’ll just switch around until everyone’s done 
that. Any questions? 
Number 1, please get ready. Two minutes each, so it will be roughly just 
under a minute for the first Bandstand, and then you’ll have about a minute 
or so for the second bit. 
Hypnotists, when you finish your show, when you’ve had time to switch 
hypnotists, make sure you put your volunteers to sleep first. Then bring 
them back with a clear suggestion. So you always have that routine of 
putting them in trance, clearing suggestion and finishing up.
Does that make sense to everyone?
Yes.
So when you finish your skits, at the end, you put them to sleep, clear the 
suggestion and then hand off to the next hypnotist. Okay, folks. Are we 
ready? Okay, number three begin.

Invent A Routine
Igor:
[
]
All right, folks. Can you guys just come around so you can see this? You 
can leave your chairs there because you’re coming back to them. Just bring 
yourselves over here to see this. Bring your partners out of trance, folks. 
This is not hypnotherapy. Just 1-2-3, wide awake, will do. 1-2-3, wide 
awake, will do. There you go. Just bring them back. We’re not doing 
hypnotherapy here, folks. This is a show. It doesn’t take very long. 
All right, first, how much fun are you guys having?
Applause
Who here is starting to feel like a genuine stage hypnotist? Are you feeling 
it? Good. 
So I thought it would be fun before the break to do one more cycle like this, 
but it starts with answering one of the questions asked earlier on. Just start 
spurring your creativity. What I want you to do is to surprise yourself. Here’s 
what I mean.
You’re going to be the hypnotist. You’re going to start with Bandstand 
again, just because you’re used to it. We’re going to do that only for 30 
seconds, just to kind of give you a little bit of thinking time, observation time, 
just feel-good time. 
As soon as the music switches, I want you to invent a routine. Just start 
with anything. It’s not as tough as it sounds. You can choose something you 
already saw someone do, something you’ve seen Spencer do up here or 
something you’ve always wanted to try. I don’t care what it is. It can even 
be a repeat of what we just did now. 
What I want to give you an opportunity of doing is watching people doing 
one of their group routines and saying, you know that person, yeah, that 
person’s digging it. I feel like I’m going to do something like this with them. 
Does that make sense to you guys?
You’re only going to have a minute and half, so 30 seconds for the warm-
up, and like a minute or so to start playing with the routine. Whether it works 
or it doesn’t, I don’t really care. It doesn’t really matter. What matters is that 
you start looking for the opportunities, rather than trying to script it out hard 
lined. 
Does that make sense to everyone? Any questions? This time, make sure 
you’re really observing all your subjects, just to see which one you want to 

280
play with, what comes to mind that fits that person as you see them 
performing. There will always be one of them; maybe there will be two. 
Make sense? Easy. One question over here… 
Can you repeat what we’re supposed to do?
Okay, just to repeat what we’re supposed to do. You’re going to do exactly 
what you did then. 
1. Instant inductions. Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.
2. The Big Band – 30 seconds.
3. When the music changes, you get to invent, make up a new routine. 
It can be something you’ve seen, something you’ve heard about, something 
you always wanted to try or something that no one has seen on this planet 
before you came along. I really don’t care what it is. 
If you’re stuck, do you know what to do? One of these things. So, you’re 
never stuck. The point is you’ll always have something to pull out of your 
back pocket when you need it. 
Does that make sense to everyone? Yes? Excellent! All right. Get back in 
your groups. Number 1, please get ready. Okay, number 1, begin.
Student:
Igor:

281
Run A Smooth Show
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
Are all the groups complete, more or less? For some of the people, like half 
their brain’s shut off, but that’s all right. How are you guys keeping up? 
Good.
So we’re on one of the last two sessions, so just keep going, guys. This is a 
boot camp. Dig deep. Dig deep now. Come on, deeper and deeper.
Notice how you’re starting to perform like a stage hypnotist. It’s a lot of fun 
once you get into it, right? You’ll learn as you start doing it that more of the 
energy comes from your volunteers than from you because otherwise you’d 
burn out after an hour’s show. That will come with time, so don’t concern 
yourself about that element too much just yet.
What I want to cover a little bit are the dynamics in terms of how I would 
tend to sequence things, just to make it a little easier. Now remember, as 
Spencer said, if you have the right context, the right subjects and the right 
situation, you can pretty much do anything straight off the bat. It’s no big 
deal. 
What we’re trying to do here is create a solid foundation, so you have 
everything lined up in such a way that you get the best possible outcome, 
no matter what group you have in front of you. Does that make sense?
If that’s your starting point, then everything after that is just a variation of it. 
You can drop something or move some things, but you’re doing it on 
purpose and you know how to fix it if things don’t quite go right. Does that 
make sense, everyone?
We normally start with:
1. The self-intro.
2. The intro to your show.
3. Calling up volunteers.
4. Doing a little suggestion test with the volunteers.
5. More volunteers.
6. A little induction to have the whole ritual.
7. Plug in exactly what you did a moment ago.
Do you see how the whole thing becomes a nice, rich show-type 
environment? Here’s something that I’d like you to keep in mind. In terms of 
how you select your routines, when you’re warming people up, the first 
thing you’re going to look for, is physical routines, group routines and 
physical group routines.

282
Any ideas why? Why would you want to have physical group routines?
Physical suggestions are easy and get group compliance. 
That’s part of the reason, but not the main one. 
You want people to move because that’s what your show’s all about.
Exactly. So he’s saying you want people to move because that’s what your 
show is all about. Essentially, what you’re looking for is your warm-up 
routines first, get people moving so that they realize this is a demonstration. 
They can have the best experience inside their head, but if no one sees it –
I mean who here would like to see a show where for 19 minutes you see 
this?
I might be having a great time in here, but you’re going, what the hell is 
this? Is this like modern art or something? So you’re looking for the most 
responsive subject, and they may not necessarily be the best subject or the 
deepest subject or anything like that. You’re looking for the most responsive 
subjects because this is a show. 
You can also encourage people to get more emotion in because the more 
they get physically involved, the more they kind of lose themselves in the 
experience as well. 
Of course, the other thing you’re looking for is you’re already starting to 
choose which people do I want to use next when I start doing the one-on-
one stuff? You’re beginning to notice this guy here is a little bit into it. This 
other guy’s is really into it. Which one do you use? You want physical group 
routines, which gives you a chance to check out who you’re going to be 
using next. 
The next thing you’re looking for are mental routines. They can be 
emotional routines – changing their emotions – or having experiences like 
forgetting a name or something like that, or amnesia or some mental 
experience.
What you’re doing here is, again, all the simple things you’re doing – with 
like name change or forgetting name or forgetting a number – you’re taking 
a low level risk to again find out which ones are responding well so you can, 
for example, choose someone to send into the audience later on to do 
crazy stuff. 
For example, you may have noticed when Steve was up here, he didn’t 
forget his name. So you have two choices. You can do what I did, which 
was just put him in trance and work with someone else. No big deal. 
Everyone will forget that by the end of the show. Or you fractionate him. 
Student:
Igor:
Student:
Igor:

283
You put him in, put him out, put him in, put him out and try again. 
Depending on how much time you have and, honestly, how much effort you 
want to put into it. 
Would I then choose someone like Scott straightaway to go in for a post-
hypnotic suggestion and go into the audience to do something? Not at that 
point. Now I might after I fractionated him and got success with a simple 
mental routine, like name amnesia, number amnesia, changing name or 
something like that. 
I’m looking to see if he’s not only responding physically, but also does he 
have the mental experience as well because now I have the material to do 
a good show, don’t I? See how that works? 
Once you’ve chosen your physically responsive subjects, once you have 
chosen your mentally responsive subjects, pretty much you’re open to 
anything. I mean you saw the heckler routine and the Sheriff. You can build 
that up. I’ve seen things like the Sheriff build up into a 20-minute routine, 
which was hysterical just because they really milked it. 
That only works if you’ve been watching out for the ones that are, physically 
responsive and going to have their own experience as well. So there’s this 
little, I guess, escalation of hypnotic things, experiences. 
By the way, I’m not saying that someone who’s got a mental experience is 
deeper in trance than someone who’s got a physical experience. I’m not. 
These are purely to do with shows. These are just useful things to do in a 
show. That’s all. Are we good?

Your 7-Step Show
So now we want to put everything together so you have an experience of 
doing that. I want to take five minutes and I want you back in your groups 
again. You’re going to have five minutes from start to finish. We’re going to 
be sequencing to the music for all of you. I want you to really make an effort 
to stick to the music, stick to your timings, because when the five minutes 
are up, I want you to have gone through the whole segment of what you’re 
doing. 
So what is it you’re going to be doing?
1. You’re going to start with an Intro. 
You’re going to be in The Green Room, and as soon as the general 
background music starts, you’re going to be doing your Intro. That will last 
for a few, shall we say, for like 10 seconds or so. Then the volume will go 
up on that normal Intro kind of music, that sort of background music, which 
is, basically, your calling for volunteers.
2. Call for volunteers.
You’ll be given about 30 seconds of that, so you’re now coming close to the 
minute mark. At that point, the music will go back down again to a lower 
level.
3. Do your tests and calling for more volunteers.
This time, just to keep it easy. When you do your first call for volunteers, 
maybe one or two people will come up. No more than that. When you do 
your tests with the three people that are left over, then of course the rest will 
come up, and you’ll again work with five subjects, just to kind of play with 
the dynamic a little bit. 
It doesn’t mean you have to use all five subjects on your stage, but you’ll be 
playing with all five subjects, and you’ll pretend there’s an audience behind 
you. The rest of the room is your audience. 
Does all this make sense so far? It’s what you did earlier today. So let’s just 
get the timings on this. You’ll have a minute for this and a minute for that. 
We’re now into minute 2. 
4. Do an induction.
Now we’re going to do an induction. I want you to do a group induction. You 
can do the whole sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep. That’s fine. There’s no 

285
problem with that, but I want you to add maybe 30 seconds or 40 seconds 
of maybe taking them on a beach trip or just progressive relaxation, 
whatever you want to do. 
The point is the audience has come here to see you do this magical, 
mystical experience. Unless you specifically structure your show so there is 
no induction – which some people have done as a gimmick – most people 
expect to see it. It’s just part of the mystery of the show. So you may as well 
give them that mystery. 
So we’re now at 2 ½ to 3 minutes. Actually, you know what? We’ll give you 
30 seconds for this because you’ll need more time for the actual show 
element. 
Let me emphasize why I’m pushing you with these timings. Tomorrow, we’ll 
be going into this in much more detail, and we’ll actually start constructing 
your shows. On Sunday, you will be doing a 9-minute show. Right now, 
you’ll be doing a dry run of a set piece of a 5-minute show, but already see 
how close those timings get. 
If you let the timing slip in here, well, on your show, you may not have a 
chance to complete all the big dramatic stuff, which means your promo tape 
won’t be anywhere near as exciting as you’d like it to be. So I’m pushing 
you just so that you can actually a great 9-minute show with all the bells 
and whistles in place. 
The irony is, come Sunday, it will be easier. Any guesses why? Well, 
because you’ve practiced and it’s easy, but the big reason is the fact that 
here you’ve got to work with whoever is in your group. On Sunday, you’ll 
have a whole audience, and you get to select who the heck you want. You 
can have anyone you want. So at that point, you’ll actually have to work a 
lot less because they’ll be doing most of the work for you. 
So is everyone good for the first 2 ½ minutes? All right. We’re going to cycle 
through these very quickly. We’re going to do two warm-up routines: the 
drunk/stoned one for about 30 seconds and then we’ll move straight into the 
Big Band for about 30 seconds again. 
So again, you’re just really ripping people through these experiences as 
quickly as possible.
On Sunday, you get to choose whether you want to do one warm-up, two 
warm-ups or three warm-ups. You get to choose. You get to choose 
however you want to use your time up. That’s entirely your choice. For now, 
we’re pushing you through these things so you’re familiar with every 
segment of a show. 
Make sense? Yes?

Igor:
Yes.
Did you have a question? Can I have a microphone over here, please?
With the testing volunteers and the induction, that’s a group induction, and 
after you have the volunteer up there, you do the test with them 
demonstrating to the rest of the audience what to do, and you bring up 
more volunteers…
Actually you’ll do the test with the audience. This test here is primarily for 
the audience so you can get more people from the audience to come up on 
stage.
And you use the volunteer to demonstrate to the audience what they’re 
going to do?
No. Let’s say you’re my audience. Can I just borrow you? You’ll be up here 
as one of my volunteers, just to set the dynamic. So my first call for 
volunteers gets me one solitary person. I’m going, oh man, this better be a 
good subject or I’m really screwed on this show.
So now what I’m going to do is, okay, I need more volunteers. Everyone, 
please stand up with your hands out like this. Now you can join along or you 
might even make a show of it. Say, do what Arthur does. Okay? 
Sit down. Thank you. Give him a round of applause for that.
Applause
So the point here, the test – folks, let’s have your attention. This is a good 
question. The point of the test here is you’re doing it with the audience 
because whoever passes the test in the audience, you’ll say – and Spencer 
actually gave you the line for this – if your hands are stuck together and you 
want to have some fun, come on up and join the show, or something like 
that.
And so you wouldn’t use that suggestibility test as an induction, or could
you? 
You can. Absolutely. You can do anything you want.
So you just tell them to relax, or you could do a very rapid…
For the induction here just do something simple, like what you Spencer 
doing. Just do the beach induction. It will fit into the other thing. Just give 
them soothing sounds, soothing imagery, soothing visualizations. Just 
make a soothing experience for them.

287
Why? Because it’s a show as much for them watching as it is for these 
people experiencing it. As far as you’re concerned, all you have to do is go, 
sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, and you’re really into it at that point, but 
they don’t know that. So you can actually do that. You can actually have 
your volunteers up, put them all in trance – sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep 
– and they’ll all go, oh that’s crazy! 
Remember, if you need an induction, you’ll first turn to your audience and 
say okay folks, we’re about to do something really important here. I’m going 
to ask you to be quiet for the next few moments so I can put these people in 
trance and make sure that they give you a great show. As soon as this is 
done, you can clap, stomp your feet and applaud as much as you want. For 
right now, let’s give them a chance to actually get into the experience fully. 
So it makes it even more mysterious for the audience because now they 
have to do something. Like, oh, be very quiet. 
Does that answer your question?
Yes. Thank you. 
Very good. So are we all good until the first warm-up routine? Yes?
Yes.
Then we’ll just go right back. So up until this point, we’ve been doing the 
physical routines. 
Now we’re going to do our first mental routines, which could be:
1. Forget something.
2. Name change.
3. Alien language.
That will be another minute. So now we’re onto 4 ½ minutes. Your last 30 
seconds is the end of the show. It gives you a little bit of slush time, so if 
you’re running a little long on some of these things you can catch up a little 
bit at the end there. But essentially, I want you to make sure that at the end 
of the show, you put them all back in trance, you clear all suggestions and 
then wake them back up, give them a big thank you and send them back 
out to the audience. Does that make sense?
So now you’re walking through an entire show in a small format. Then we’ll 
start talking about more routines you can use so that you can have some 
more choices on the actual day. Does that work for you?
Yes.

Are you happy with this?

Any questions? Then we’ll come on down here as well.
Igor, my question is how will we know that our show is about to finish? That 
was a problem last time.
On Sunday or now?
No, now. Will you give us a, 15 seconds left?
All this happens with music. So at this stage, you’ll have the general horse 
race music. At it will be at a low level. When the level goes up, in other 
words it becomes louder, that will be your call for volunteers. 
As soon as the level drops again, it gives you enough quiet to do the test 
with the audience. When the music switches – and I’ll talk about this in a 
minute with Matt to be sure we’ve got the right music – the music will switch 
to the induction music. So when the music switches, you should be in the 
induction phase.
When the music switches again, you’ll be in the drunk/stoned phase. When 
it switches again, you’ll be in the Bandstand phase. When it goes back to 
the regular background music, you’re in this phase here. Yeah, we’ll switch 
it again. I’ll find a track for you guys. 
So when the music switches a final time and it’s completely different music 
that you won’t have heard until this point that will be your cue that you 
better start wrapping things up. 
Does that make sense? Yes? So do listen to the music. Do not skip ahead. 
I know you guys have a group of five. Please stay to these times as well. 
It’s in your interest because otherwise, you’ll have half a show on the day, 
and I’m guess you don’t want that, right?
There’s a question here first, and then we’ll pass it over here.
It was the same question. Musical cues.
Okay, fine. So let’s give Scott a go.
For point number 6, are we doing one mental routine or more than one?

289
Igor:
Student:
Igor:
As many as you want. More importantly, as many as you can fit in and if 
you can do all three, by all means, do so. If you can only do one, then milk 
it. It’s entirely up to you. This is where you get to start taking control of a 
little bit of the session. 
Is this clear as a process? One last question over here.
I just wanted to clarify if that Intro is also the Introduction of hypnosis as 
well?
Exactly, the whole thing. So you are now pretending that you’re off stage. 
Someone just said, the amazing hypnotist is ready. You’re going to come 
on stage and go, hi. So you’re starting the whole show from scratch. You 
say hi, my name is… This is hypnosis. This is my show come on up, etc. 
So why don’t we take a minute to organize yourselves back in groups. So 
you guys go over here, and get Number 1 ready to start rolling. I’m going to 
cue up the music for you guys.

Are you ready with the music in the back there? Hypnotist Number 1, 
please give me a thumbs up if you’re ready to go. All right, let’s begin.
How are you doing?
Great.
Was that fun?
Yes.
All right, let me try that again. Folks, was that fun?
Yes!
Give yourself a round of applause. You deserve it.

Do you want to do more of this?
Yes.
Yes maybe? No? All right, we’re having a break right now. So I think we’ve 
run five minutes over on this little session, but it was worth doing just for the 
fun of it. So let’s be back here – it’s now 4:50. Let’s be back here by 5:00, 
and we’ll be starting at 5:05 on the dot. All right? 
So just take care of whatever natural breaks you need to. So be back here 
at 5:00. We’re starting at 5:05 on the dot. So off you go. 

291
Skit Music
Igor:
Student:
Igor:
So the second white piece of paper, the one you actually have on your chair 
is this. It’s entitled, Music for Skits. What we’re going to be doing is, you 
may have noticed we’ve been playing some music here whilst you’re doing 
here little mini shows today, right? 
We have that music available for you, and each room that we go into on 
Sunday for the shows will have an iPod and these 24 tracks on it. So you 
should recognize a lot of these skits or routines, because you’ve seen them, 
done them or talked about them with Spencer. 
Tomorrow, we’ll talk more about this stuff. Tomorrow, you’re going to 
actually start choosing the skits you’ll want to use for your own show, and 
you can choose anything on these things if you want music. If you don’t 
care about music, you can choose anything at all as well. Does that make 
sense? It’s just this is the music you’ll be able to use on the actual show 
and unfortunately, nothing else. I’ll explain why in a moment. 
Could you tell us now please?
Okay, sure. The main reason has to do with copyrights. In order to be able 
to use music and a formal DVD and put that onto your promo tape, you 
have to pay an exorbitant fees on copyrights and so on, and you’ll have to 
pay a fee every time it gets reprinted and stuff like that. It’s just a nightmare. 
So we’ve got royalty-free music for that. That just takes the nightmare 
totally away.
In terms of doing your shows, each country is a little different, so you have 
to check into the rules. As a rule, each country has a copyrights or a 
musical rights association, where people who want to play music pay 
money, and they split it up with some complex formula so the actual artists 
get the money for whatever is being played and used.
Now as a rule, technically, as a hypnotist, when you’re using this music, it 
should be licensed by this organization to be using the various tracks and 
so on. In practice, no hypnotist I know of ever does that. The few that have 
actually approached these musical rights associations have just been told 
to go away. This is so insignificant for us it’s not worth our time. Just go 
away and use it anyway. 
So there’s not going to be any trouble, but legally speaking, I can’t tell you 
to do that because it’s, at least in the U.S. and a lot of other countries, that’s 
not the case. You technically have to pay some licensing fees. The best 
thing to do is check with whatever – in the U.K. it’s the PRS, the Performing

292
Rights Society. The U.S. will have an equivalent. Just check with them, and 
as soon as they tell you to go away and jump in the lake, then you can go, 
great. I’ve done what I can, and they ignored me. Make sense?
For the purpose of the show here, we’ve got royalty-free music, so you 
don’t have to even consider that at all. That headache’s been taken care of 
for you. 
Do have a look at these skits tonight. See which ones appeal to you. The 
only one we will not be doing is Number 21. Everyone looks at me and 
goes, all right. For obvious reasons, it’s kind of on there just so you know 
that if that’s the kind of show you want to have, well, I’m sure it will keep 
you company tonight?
The key thing here is – and I know Spencer has already talked to you about 
this a little bit, if you do want to go for more of the X-rated type shows, or 
the adult type shows, by all means, do so. Just remember two things:
1. Nothing will stigmatize you more quickly than that. 
In other words, once you start doing those kinds of shows and that’s what 
you’re known for. That’s pretty much what you’re stuck with. It’s going to be 
very difficult to get out of that mold. Versus if you have a general show, you 
have the flexibility to go into any kind of environment. So that’s one 
consideration to take into account.
2. Only ever do an adult show if it’s advertised as an adult show. 
That way, the audience becomes self-selecting. Otherwise, you’re going to 
have an absolute nightmare up on stage when you start suggesting the 
wrong kinds of things to people and they weren’t prepared or expecting it. 
You’ll have the nightmare on stage or off stage afterwards, and it’s not fair 
to your audience either. So if you’re going to go down that road, that’s the 
only way to do it. Make sure everyone actually understands ahead of time 
what they’re letting themselves into.
Honestly, personally, I don’t see the point. If you want to do that, it’s a 
personal choice. I can’t stop you. I’m just warning you about the 
consequences and, personally, I don’t see the point of it. It’s up to you what 
you do. 
So we’re all cool with the white piece of paper? Do check through it and 
start thinking about what you might find interesting. Think about how you 
might phrase it because tomorrow we’ll start putting it all together. You don’t 
have to design your show tonight. That’s not what I’m suggesting. Just kind 
of get inspired by some of these things, and imagine how you might do this.

Igor:
Edward:
Igor:
Did you say that we could hear this music somewhere? Do you have it?
Unfortunately, we can’t give you all a copy yet, just because we haven’t got 
enough. We thought we’d bring the CDs, but then everyone hasn’t got a CD 
player, so there’s no way we can get you to hear it. What we will do, 
though, if you like is tomorrow at lunch break – it will take about hour to play 
through all these songs because there’s quite a few of them and they’re like 
three minutes apiece. 
What we can do is at some point during the lunch break tomorrow, we can 
play the 24 songs in order and give you like a minute sample, so in like a 
half an hour or 20 minutes, you’ll get a sense of what they all sound like, 
and that will give you a taste of it. Would you guys like to do that?
That would be great. Thank you.
So it means your lunch break will be a bit shorter tomorrow, so be prepared 
for that. If you want to listen in, make sure you pick up a sandwich or 
something from the sandwich store, but tomorrow we can arrange that for 
you guys to have a listen. All right.
So is everyone cool with the white sheet?

The Law

Student:
Igor:
Student:
Igor:
Do you have any questions on this? Otherwise, I’ll just leave this and we’ll 
just get onto the other stuff.  
Yeah, one of the things that you said, me coming from Scotland and Great 
Britain, we have such a thing as the Hypnotism Act of 1952. Now I’ve just 
learned before I came out here that before I make a booking to get myself 
on stage, I’m going to have to jump through some loopholes. 
Yes, you do.
One of them being I cannot advertise myself as a hypnotist or that I’m going 
to hypnotize someone on stage…
Not necessarily. 
It must be self-hypnosis. 
Not necessarily. It depends on what you’re doing. Stage hypnosis is legal n 
the U.K. The Hypnotism Act, basically, means you have to be certified by 
the local authority in which you want to be performing a show. They have to 
say yes, you’re approved for doing a show in this area. 
So there are two ways – there’s a cheat way around it. What some people 
do is they don’t actually do a stage hypnosis show. They do a lecture on 
stage hypnosis or they do research on hypnosis, and as long as people fill 
out a form, it’s technically covered. I wouldn’t go down that road. It’s not a 
very safe road to go.
The simpler thing to do is call up your local authority, tell them you’re a 
stage hypnotist, you’ve been trained in Las Vegas and you have your 
promo and stuff like that, so you can show them that you’re good at this 
work. If they need to they can come to us for references and that you now 
want to start working in the U.K. and that you want to work in such and such 
a venue, that you’re professionally trained and that you’ve done all these 
bits and pieces. 
Tell them that you’ve done a show on the Strip in Vegas – because you will 
have done that. Then, ask what the process is that you need to go through 
to get approved or marked for approval to be allowed to do a stage show 
there.

295
Some authorities are more hard lined, and some authorities are easier, but 
most of them you’ll get through if you can demonstrate competence. Let’s 
face it, with a promo tape, it’s very easy. Just send it to them and say, 
watch me. 
I’ve been told as well that as long as a sect is private clubs, especially 
Glasgow because Glasgow has a ban on public displays. I mean you can’t 
even do the street hypnosis. If you get caught doing street hypnosis in the 
street, you go to jail. There’s no public display of hypnosis.
I can’t comment on that. As I say, it’s been a long time since I’ve needed a 
lawyer and that didn’t do Scottish law.
That’s why I’m hoping to move over here. 
Well, actually, this is very true. As a stage hypnotist, you’re open to work 
anywhere. You can go to some of the Islands, for example, where there’s 
no regulation. You just go. You can work on a cruise ship. Again, there’s no 
regulation there. You just have to get into that sort of scene. You could 
even be booked in America and be paid to fly over and do some shows and 
have fun at the same time. So you’re not stuck within the U.K. arena. 
Although if you do want to work in the U.K. arena, I recommend that you get 
yourself licensed by the local authority you’ll be performing in. Then if you 
become a traveling hypnotist, it’s a lot easier. Once you’ve got one license, 
it gets easier and easier to get a license in other places too.

How to Invent New Routines
Spencer:
Create Your Own Routines
He’s handing on by a thread. I’ll bet. He’s losing it. That’s probably a pretty 
good term there. 
Well, we’re going to lose it a little bit more, but not too much. We’re going to 
slow it down a little bit because I want to talk about some other things. 
Before I do, how did you guys like doing that? Yeah! So are you guys 
starting to get the groove of it, man? Are you starting to feel like you’re a 
real professional competent, confident and extreme powerful stage 
hypnotist?
You guys are. I’m telling you right now. I’m looking at you, and I can see 
this confidence just oozing out of you. This is good. I know you’re also 
drained and exhausted, so I recognize both aspects going on, but that’s 
good because when you get to this point, you’ve got to go further. You’ve 
got to go a little bit further. 
I can tell you that from my career that sometimes I get exhausted being on 
the road and sometimes you’re just wiped out and you’ve just got one more 
show to do and I’m just going, oh no, I can’t do it. I’ll be laying in the room 
going I really just don’t even want to get up. I just want to stay in bed. I just 
want to watch some stupid thing on TV or I’ll turn on my light and sound 
machine instead and just zone out. I use that every single day.
I know that I’ve got to do one more show. I’ve just got to do it. I’ve got to be 
ready for it. I anchor myself, like I talked about before. I go there, get on 
stage and do that last thing and give it everything I’ve got, and then I drop 
for a week or two. 
So when you’re done with this, you can go home and drop for a week or 
two, after you book your first show. Then you can drop because you’ve got 
a show coming up, a big show. 
Let me ask you how many of you plan on doing your first big comedy 
hypnosis show within the next 30 days? Raise your hands. I like that, a 
whole bunch of you.
So let’s do this. Let’s go down this list here. You guys have done all these 
really incredibly cool techniques. Now I have a few more techniques here–
two more skits. Instead of breaking down into groups and getting 
yourselves all bottled again, let’s just talk about it, and I’m going to open it 

297
up. I’m going to throw out a routine, and you guys just tell me what you 
would do with, and I’ll tell you what I might do with it. How does that sound? 
That will give your mind a little bit of a break. 
I’m starting to see people out there dropping. How many of you people here 
are married? Raise your hand if you’re married. How many of you are in a 
relationship? Let me ask you this, let’s narrow it down. How many of you 
are married or in a relationship and planning on taking this as a serious full-
time career? Quite a few of you, okay. Awesome!
You’re going to need a very supportive partner. You’ve got that? That’s right 
on. So you’re going to need a very supportive partner, because it’s a very 
unique profession and oftentimes, it will take you to places that you don’t 
take a spouse or a buddy with. Sometimes you just have to go on your own. 
I’m letting you know this ahead of time to work on your relationships and 
keep them solid because you need to put as much energy into your 
relationship as you do into your job. You don’t want to lose that because of 
your passion for what you’re going to be doing because it is something that 
can easily overtake you and it can become your mistress or your mister. 
I know I had to give you the down side to it. There’s always a downside, but 
a supportive partner, man. Bring your partner into your work. Let them know 
what it is that you’re doing. Share your life with them. Share your work. 
Invite them to go with you everywhere that you do. Make them a part of it. 
Maybe they can be that part that takes the phone calls for you. 
They could be your manager. They could do all your bookings. They can 
take care of the paperwork. Include them in what you’re doing. Make them 
feel important in it. That’s all I’m going to say. So you guys work that out, 
and you’re going to be good with it. 
With that said, I’ve got a lot of things to say though. I’ll say more about that 
tomorrow when we get to the business aspect of it. Right now, get ready for 
a microphone, and when you do get a microphone, you’re going to stand up 
and you’re going to speak into the microphone. You guys are good at this. 
Let’s just say the individual I’m touching right now, this is your luckiest day 
in the world. This is your luckiest day in the world. What would you do with 
that routine? I’m looking for some feedback. Here’s a guy right who knows 
right now, this is your luckiest day in the world. What are you going to do?
I would say this is your luckiest day in the world. You have won a lotto 
ticket, but you can’t find it. It’s somewhere in your pockets or on your body, 
but you can’t find it. You’re checking everywhere for it, but you can’t find it. 
No matter how hard you try, you won’t take off your clothes, but you can’t 
find that ticket and it’s getting frustrating.

Does anybody else have an idea on that, the luckiest day in the world, right 
here?
Okay, it’s the luckiest day in the world for you. You’ve just won the Nobel 
Peace Prize and everyone here is waiting for your speech. 
Cool. So this is the luckiest day in the world for you. You’ve just won the 
Nobel Peace Prize. I’m going to count to three, and on three you’re eyes 
will open. I’m going to give you the microphone and you can give us your 
acceptance speech, because you are the luckiest guy in the world on the 
luckiest day. Here’s the microphone. 1-2-3, and the guy grabs it. Very cool.  
Anybody else? Just when you thought it was all over, we’re going to pick 
your brains some more. We’re going to bring out the juices.
All right, you’re the luckiest person in the world. You just won $1 million. I 
want you to express to the audience how excited you are and give shout 
outs to your family and friends and go as wild as you want. Let him do a 
little speech to the family. 
All right. I like that, and you can even do that as a group. This is your 
luckiest day in the world. On the count of three, open your arms. We’re 
going to find out just what happened to you guys. Boom, boom, boom. Then 
you can rip them down.
Go ahead, my dear.
This is the luckiest day in your life. You’ve won $10 million and you can’t tell 
anyone, but every time someone says to you, how come you look so happy, 
if you tell them that you won $10 million, you won’t get the check. 
I like that. Very cool. I can kind of relate to that. I can’t tell you exactly where 
that came from, but you know I got one. 
It’s recording your every move.
It’s recording my every move? It means nothing because we don’t know 
exactly where it came from, and that’s all I have to promise. 
This is the luckiest day of the world for you. You just won the lottery, and 
you’re going to be doing your lucky dance that helped you win that lottery. 
So get going.

Oh, so in a moment, I’m going to count to three, the music begins and 
you’re going to give us your lucky dance.  
That’s right. And anyone who joins in gets to share the lottery with you.
Good. There you go. Now you got everybody involved with it. I like it. 
The only problem is their share of the lottery comes out of your pocket. 
Oh no, wow. There you go. You bring them up and then tear them down.
Yes, sir?
Today is the luckiest day of your life. You just won $10 million, but do you 
see those people sitting next to you. One of them is going to steal it 
tomorrow and you’ve got figure out which one it is.
Very cool. And how can you build on that? 
What you do is you walk behind them, and you’ll notice that they either, 
have wallets or pocketbooks. Look at their butts. As you look at their butts, 
you’ll notice one of them just has that, look at the butt and you’ll know by 
looking at it which one it is, and when you find it… I don’t know what you 
can do that’s PG13. When you find that butt, identify that person and ask 
them why they’re going to steal your money. Confront them with it and 
make a deal with them that maybe they won’t steal it and maybe you can do 
something together nice with it. 
Cool. I like it. Good. Does anybody else want to do this? There’s someone 
right there, so you don’t have to walk so far. 
Today’s the luckiest day in your life. The girl that you’ve been pursuing (or 
man) forever, Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie, it doesn’t matter who it is, has 
called you and asked you on a date. The problem is you haven’t had a 
shower in three days because you’ve been camping. You’ve only got three 
minutes to primp yourself before they pick you up in the limo. 
On the count of three, open your eyes. Get your primped proper for this 
meeting. Then you can have a little bag of makeup over here to the side. So 
you can build on that. Over here, I’m going to give you this little bag of 
makeup. You have to have more of your props. 
I’ve got this great big bag full of props for every occasion, so I’m always 
thinking what can I do? What’s in my bag? So I’ll take out some makeup. I 
have this little makeup kit. It’s got mascara, it’s got lipstick and I even have 
panties and bra and all that kind of stuff. Really make yourself look hot. 
Very cool. Get themselves all clowned up. That’s pretty goofy. It’s a lot of 
fun. Yes, dear?

Today is your luckiest day in your life because you find the source that from 
now on all your questions will be answered. 
You’ve found the source? Now with that, do you know what I think I would 
do? You found the source. The individual I’m touching right now, in a 
moment I’m going to count to three, your eyes open, you are the source. 
You are the source with all the answers because the luckiest person here in 
the world has questions for you. Count of three your eyes open, 1-2-3. And 
so why are you so lucky? Oh because I found the source. The source? 
Where is the source? Oh, I’m the source. 
So you’ve got another thing going on there. See how you can just fall into 
these things? You’ve got to be quick on your toes. 
Do you have a microphone? Please stand up.
This is the luckiest day because you just saved 10% on car insurance. I 
would recommend canceling your other insurance after the big accident. 
Yeah, why not just make him a little lizard. 
And you’re now the Geico lizard. 
There you go. 
It’s the luckiest day in your life because you just won the Academy Awards 
that you’ve been trying to get for 20 years 1-2-3, acceptance speech.
That’s fine. They get up there and then you have music in the background 
for the acceptance speech. So you have to have all this stuff set up. It’s 
already in your mind, it’s in the frame. On the count of three, open your 
eyes and give the acceptance speech. 1-2-3, eyes open up. Oh wow, this is 
so cool. You won, man. Come on up here. Here’s a microphone. Tell us 
what it’s like when the music begins automatically. Then the music starts 
and he gives his little speech. 
So you have all these things set up in your mind so when you’re doing 
these routines, you already have this going in your mind what’s going to 
happen. You’re five steps ahead all the time. It’s like playing chess. You’re 
ahead of everybody at all times. It’s on that mental programming. Listen to 
it. You’ll get it. 
One more and then we’re going to move on to the next one. 
You’re the luckiest person in the world because I have here in my pocket a 
check for $1 million for the first person to show me their belly button. Then I 
put them all out and tell them they haven’t got a belly button. 

301
Spencer:

Okay, so I’ve got a check in my pocket for $1 million for the first person that 
does what now?
To show me their belly button, but I’ve put them all out and tell them they 
haven’t got one. When they look for it, they can’t find.
Oh, they can look for it, but they can’t find it. Okay, that’s kind of funny. I like 
that because it’s like, show me your belly button and you can have this 
money. Then they go and they can’t find their belly button. Where’s my belly 
button? That’s cool. 
And then you can do, is it an innie or is it an outie? It’s a little kid thing right. 
Have you got an innie or an outie? How many people here have an inny? 
Raise your hand. How many have an outie? I’m just kind of curious. I’m 
telling you, this is how my mind works. I’m just kind of curious about who’s 
got an innie and who’s got an outie. 
All right, let’s go on to the next one. All right, here’s a good one. How about 
the individual I’m touching right now, you are the world’s sexiest spy. 
Actually, this will follow up, you get the guy up and you tell him he’s the 
world’s sexiest spy. Then you have two different ladies, and you tell them 
that they are his co-spies, and they’re both in love with him, but he has to 
choose which one he’s going to take on the next mission. So they’re 
arguing over him, but they can’t hit each other. He’s in the middle and he’s 
got to decide, and the world is about to explode.
The plot thickens. I like that, yeah. You have these women in a cat fight. 
Now you want to frame that very carefully. When you’re giving this 
information on that kind of skit, it’s a lot of fun. 
In a moment, I’ll count to three, the person I’m touching you are the world’s 
sexiest spy. You’ve got these two beautiful women assistants, they’re 
fighting over you and they’re going to fight over you. Boy, I’ll tell you what, 
they’re going to fight like I’ve never seen anybody fight. However, listen 
very carefully, you two ladies, you assistants, you will not touch each other. 
You will say whatever you want to each other. You will get just as nasty as 
you want, but you will not hit anybody at all, but you verbally say whatever 
you want. 
No spitting. No whizzing on somebody. I was doing this nightclub show and 
I gave this suggestion, and this guy was out there. I said, you can say 
whatever you want. I said something like, ladies and gentlemen, you get 
very angry. You want to start a fight with me. I love doing it. I said, but you 
can’t get on my stage and you can’t throw anything at me. 

302
So this guy is back there, and he gets on a chair and he starts taking the 
chair and getting it closer and getting it closer. Then he gets up there and 
just throws it at me, and I’m going, oh this is not good. So always be a little 
bit careful because you don’t want the audience people to get hurt either. 
Yes, go ahead, sir?
You’re the world’s sexiest spy, and it’s your mission to romance one of the 
other contestants on the stage. What you don’t realize is that you have the 
world’s worst body odor. 
Oh, good. I like that. Okay, so go on and build on that. But you have the 
worst body odor. How would you complete that? But you have the worst 
body odor. You’ve got to put your people up here. 
What I would be looking for is what the person who is supposed to be 
seduced is going to be doing. 
Okay, and…
And you, the person who’s being seduced, realize that this is a spy and you 
have to put up with him, but you’re trying to escape while he’s making his 
advances.
Okay. Anybody else?
Hello? You’re the world’s sexiest spy and you’re in the President’s office. 
He’s about to tell him the secret code word, but you have the worst case of 
stuttering and you just can’t get that word out to tell the President, and the 
President is just sitting there waiting for you with the code word.
I like that. I had this guy in Dubai and made him really hate my guts bad. 
He’s out in the audience and he’s just yelling at me every time I said this 
trigger word. He’s out there cussing at me. I mean he’s using words that 
you don’t use in Dubai. You can’t use naughty words there, and you can’t 
drink alcohol in public. There are some very strict things going on there. 
So I had this big list of do’s and don’ts from the management at the theater 
that I couldn’t do. But you know me. It’s hard to keep me down. So I had 
figure out a way around it. So, it’s like, I’m not going to give a suggestion, 
but I’ll let him say whatever he wants to. So he starts using language that’s 
really bad and I’m judging the audience because I wanted to hear how the 
audience would react. 
If I hear them going oh no, then I’m going to calm it down very quickly, but 
they’re out there going whoa, yeah. Get him, get him. I knew the 
management was going to be after me later that evening too. So he’s out 
there bantering at me and I said look at you, you keep talking, but your 
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:

303
tongue is falling out. As you’re talking me, your tongue is falling out of your 
mouth.
So he’s sitting there cussing at me, mumbling. You know what I’m saying, 
right? I said, don’t tell me. Turn around and tell the audience. So he’s 
mumbling. You can turn these things around in so many different varieties, 
and I think I have that on YouTube somewhere if you want to go look it up, 
under sleep now. 
What I would do is use the world’s sexiest spy, but what I would do is 
reverse the roles. I would make it a female spy and she has the worst case 
of halitosis. The individual she’s trying to seduce, this guy, he has the 
secret information. She’s trying to seduce him, but he keeps running. He 
keeps moving over or running around the chairs. They’re staying on stage 
and they’re not doing anything violent. She’s just trying to woo him. I’d 
make sure she looked really good.
You’d do that hypnotically, right?
I just think it would be funny to watch a beautiful woman chase a guy 
around with stink breath.
That’s cool. Well, how about you take it a step further. The person I’m 
touching right now, you’re the world’s most beautiful female spy, but it’s 
really a guy. I’m not saying a transvestite, but you know the way the mind 
works. So it’s kind of fun to add that dimension. The person I’m touching 
right now, you’re the world’s sexiest spy. You are a female, and you are so 
hot. It’s incredible. You’ve got halitosis, but this person over here wants you 
bad and wants your information. 
It’s another guy, and this guy’s trying to get close. So there’s another 
dimension, or something you might add to give it a little bit more comedy, 
this woo factor. It’s like all the sudden, there’s two guys going after each 
other. That’s insane. 
Okay, cool. One more on the sexiest guy, okay.
You’re the world’s sexiest spy, but you’ve got a bad case of crabs, so you 
can’t stop itching yourself. 
Okay. I know what kind of shows you’re going to be doing. Let’s go onto the 
next routine. Sounds like high school? You haven’t worked in the bars I’ve 
been in. 
All right, let’s go onto another one. This time let’s do it this way. The person 
I’m touching right now, you are a country rock star. You’re a country rock 
star. Who’s going to do something out there? Let’s have some new blood 
Student:
Spencer:

out there. Raise your hands new blood. Come on, man. Stretch your brains. 
You’ve got to stretch your brain, a country-rock star. 
All right, there’s new blood right over there. Look at Matt. He hasn’t said a 
word. You know who Matt is, don’t you? He’s that good-looking guy in the 
suit. 
Thank you. Thank you very much. 
We haven’t got to Elvis yet.
I’d have them sing me a song about his ex-wife and his horse. 
Okay.
I’d just let him take his imagination and go from there. 
Very good. I like that. That’s good. Yeah, so you’re a country rock star. I’m 
going to count to three, open your eyes, you’re a country rock star, and 
you’re going to sing a song about your ex-wife and your horse. That’s good.
Now remember, when you’re doing these, most people have a very creative 
imagination that are really in trance. So on something like that, I might save 
for working in a nightclub where you’re going to have bunch of yahoos in 
there. I’m not saying that in a negative way, but we typecast people. 
Go ahead, Brian, and then I’ll get to you.
Yeah, you’re a country rock star, and you don’t have any voice. Only fifth 
word you say will be out loud. 
Okay, you’re a country rock star and every fifth word that you say will be out 
loud. Very cool. Okay. I like that, yeah. It’s amazing what people will do. I 
think you had your hand up next.
You’re a country rock star, but you only perform with your horse on stage. 
Part of your act is that you do quite a lot of moving around and dancing, and 
it happens that your horse has diarrhea on this particular night. 
Okay. Yuk. Okay, let’s go onto the next one. Your horse has diarrhea. You 
know what? Personally, I would stay away from crabs and diarrhea in my 
show. This is about you becoming yourself and doing your shows, so have 
fun with it.  
Yes? Stand up.

your song and the lyrics that you wrote, and she’s claiming that she wrote 
them. You’re having an interview with People Magazine about American’s 
sweetheart and what you have to say about that. 
Very cool. There’s a good one, kids. We’ve got time for one more. 
You’re a country rock star, and let’s say you’re a guy, you’d be Garth 
Brooks or somebody like that, but when you start to sing, you’re going to 
sing as a female. Or if you’re a female, then you would be singing as a 
man, so opposite singing. 
Okay, very cool. Let’s just do one more with some new blood. New blood 
and we have just run out of time. Thank you all so much. Time is up and we 
are going to be taking a break right now for lunch. Enjoy your lunch, and we 
will see you back here at 7:30 p.m. One hour from now.

All right, folks. Here’s what I’m thinking of doing. Let’s have a look at the 
time. We’re at 8:00, so we’re going to have a nice easy evening. What I 
want to do is take you through some more demonstration. Before the break 
Spencer talked to you about different skits you can do different routines and 
so on.
So what I thought we’d do now is again bring them back to life a little bit so 
you can actually watch them in action and see a true master at work. 
Maybe you can think in the back of your mind, this is what I’ll be doing so 
once I become a successful stage hypnotist. So you actually see the feel of 
the performance, as well as just the idea of the routine. Do you see the 
difference?
So unless anyone has any other question, I’m just going to hand you over 
to Spence, and let him carry on with what he’s really good at. Any 
questions? In that case, give Spence a big round of applause.
Applause
All right. Well, what do you want to do? Learn? Burn? Burn the learning into 
your brain. Okay, where did we end up last time? With a bunch of people up
here sleeping, right? Do you want to see some more routines? I’ll just move 
through them real quick.
Yes.
Okay, I need some volunteers, someone who hasn’t been up here before, 
new blood. If you have not been up here before, come on up here. How are 
you doing?
Good.
I haven’t met you yet, have I.
Nope.
How are you doing?
Good. 
I’ll put you right over there. Here we go. All right. How many of you are 
really exhausted at this point, awfully tired? You look awfully tired. If I can 
show you a way to have fun in just about 30 minutes, you’d like that, right?

And because we’re going to do this, I’m going to throw a little wrench into it. 
Please come on up here. I’m going to have a little fun with this. Okay, come 
on up here, big guy. Over here, you are going to be my assistant hypnotist 
tonight. 
Applause
How do you like that? That’s the good thing about being the hypnotist. You 
can do whatever you want. You can pull anybody from out of the crowd and 
say, you’re going to be my assistant. I’ve been watching you and I think 
you’re pretty cool.
Thank you, sir. 
You’re welcome. You didn’t have to say that, but thank you. All right, so 
here’s what we’re going to do. We’ve got some skits in here. Let’s pull up 
some new skits. Do we have different music on these other skits? I don’t 
want to go through the same ones. Or should I just do it off the top of my 
mind.
Yeah, top of your mind.
All right. We don’t care about the music, but we want music because we’re 
used to music. 
We’re going to do this together. I’m going to do one and then you do one. 
All right? What I want you to do is first let’s get these guys hypnotized. So 
let’s do this. You stand over on this side. Everybody sit back in your chairs. 
Now remember what we did earlier. 
Somewhat.
Somewhat? Okay, I want you to get serious, and let’s go through it. I want 
these guys all hypnotized, and I need it done just like that. Time is wasting.
How are you doing, sir?
Good.
That’s good. Sleep!

Who’s out there clicking? A bunch of clickers. When I was doing my show 
the other day, I was doing that all the time. Every time I’d click, you’d hear 
like 500 people all clicking at the same time. 
Get your head off of there. Okay. 
In just a moment, I’m going to count to 3, and we’re going to have a 
good time. 
Remember how we do this? Get over here. Pick one. Oh, you like that one, 
don’t you? All right. I’m going to let you pick the routines.

309
World's Sexiest Spy
In just a moment, I’m going to count to 3. Everybody sit up in your 
chairs and open your eyes, feeling fantastic in every way. The 
individual I’m touching right now, sleep very deeply. You’re going to 
sit up in your chair, and you are the world’s sexiest spy. You are the 
world’s sexiest spy. 
Do you have the number on that? Give him the number. Number six. 
The individual I’m touching right now, sit up and you will be the 
world’s sexist spy. Now listen very carefully. The people that are 
sitting around you, they’re like bad guys from around the world. It’s 
your job to find out who they are, but they don’t know who you are. 
You’re just a sexy spy, and you’re going to go around and you’re 
going to talk to them and get into every one of these people’s heads 
and figure out who they are. 
Now listen all you guys I’m touching right now, there is spy in here. 
You don’t know who it is. You’re going to be very curious about who 
it’s going to be. I’m going to count to 3, open your eyes, and we’re 
going to see where this takes us 1-2-3, wide awake. Sit up in your 
chairs.
And let’s have that spy music please. Very cool.
How are you guys doing up here? All right. So you guys look like 
you’re pretty cool. What are you up to, man? 
Oh, I don’t know. 
Come on up here for a second. Tell me something. How are you 
doing?
Good. 
Yeah, you are aren’t you? Tell me, what is it that you do?
I’m a spy. Shh.
Wow. No, I’m not going to say anything to nobody. So mum is the 
word. Yes it is. So as the world’s sexiest spy, what’s your job? What 
do you do? What do you spy on?
Bad people.

He’s naughty? What is he doing that’s naughty?
He’s looking away. 
He’s looking away. Okay. So what’s he doing? What do you think 
he’s doing by looking away?
He’s trying to not let me find out who he is. 
Oh really?
Now I want to point out something. I had the microphone. She took it into 
her hand, right? Never let your subject take the microphone away from you. 
Always take it back, unless it’s something that you’re doing. There are two 
reasons for that. 
1. You always want to control your stage.
2. If you’ve got a microphone that’s expensive and they’re hypnotized, 
they might drop it on the floor and you may lose like $800 for a 
microphone. 
So I always guard these with my life. If I give them a microphone, I always 
give them one of those cheap Radio Shack type ones that you can pick up 
for like $29.95. All right. So just keep that in mind. 
Wow. So who else is up here? Oh yeah, so tell me about this guy.
I think he has a secret.
Really? What do you think that secret is? I know that you were 
taught to read minds. 
He has weapons of mass destruction.
Really?

He could be a spy. 
He could be a spy? Wow. What if they’re all spies, do you think 
maybe these guys are all spies?
Just me.
Just you? Do you know what? I was reading your résumé and I hear 
that you can actually read people’s minds. 
Yeah, that’s true.
This is awesome, and you can really know what people are thinking. 
I mean you can look at a person, and you know what’s on their mind. 
You do, don’t you?
I do. 
What’s on my mind?
It’s dirty.
Laughter and Applause
She’s right. Let’s get some other responses out of her. 
I’m going to point to a few people, and you kind of give me an idea 
what’s on their mind. Okay? Because you’re really good at this, and I 
really like a spy that knows everything. For example, what’s this guy 
all about?
Oh, he likes lollypops.
Okay, wow. So he likes lollypops. Yeah, that’s nice. 
He likes green lollypops. 
Green lollypops, right on. Well, that’s pretty good. You are very good

Oh, you went to spy school. Well, this is very, very cool. 
I’ll tell you what, as a professional competent, confident stage hypnotist, 
you have your moments. 
How about this guy down here in the black shirt? Look at that. 
What’s that weird thing on his chest?
It’s a suck. So I think he likes to do sucking.
Laughter
Oh wow. Okay. Wow. We want to stay away from that one, right? He 
just sucks secrets out of your mind, right? Yeah, you’re a good spy. 
How about this guy over here in the black jacket and the dark hair?
Oh, he knows martial arts. 
Whoa. You are good. What kind of martial arts does he know?
Like Tae Bo.
Tae Bo. You do that very, very well. I like the way you do that. You 
really are a nice spy. I like that. So tell me, if I want to be a spy like 
you, what do I need to do?
You have to wear really sexy clothes, and then you have to go to spy 
school.
Oh really? Do you think I have a chance of that?
Hmmm. Maybe. 
Okay, maybe. Very well. Go ahead and have a seat back over there.
Everyone, give her a round of applause. Make her feel good.

Sleep very deeply. Let’s just burn it up a little bit. The guy I’m 
touching right now is sleeping very, very deeply. The person I’m 
touching right now, sleep very, very deeply. There you go.
In a moment, I’m going to count to three, the music will begin. You’re 
going to stand up and you’re going to look across and see the most 
beautiful woman you’ve ever seen standing up looking for you. This 
is the best thing that’s ever happened to you in your entire life. I’m 
going to count to three, and you’re going to stand up, and the most 
beautiful woman you’ve ever seen is going to stand looking directly 
at you. 
You know who she is because she will be standing up looking 
directly at you. You want a little bit of the action. You’re going to have 
so much fun. You’re going to want to dance with her because she is 
hot. She has got the most sandals on her feet. Love the T-shirt. 
You’re going to dance. You’re going to come together like you’ve 
never danced before. When the music begins, when I count to 3, 
you’re on. 
The individual I’m touching right now, sleep very, very deeply. I’ve 
got a treat for you because I know you’re here alone and you want 
something bad. So I’ve got a special date for you. On the count of 3, 
the music will begin, you will stand up, you will look to your left and 
you’ll see the most beautiful woman standing up. She is hot, 
beautiful, the nicest thing in the room. You just want a little bit of that 
action. You will dance with her like you’ve never danced before. 
You’re going to be a little shy, maybe a little coy coming together, 
checking each other out, wondering what’s going to happen. But 
then you come together and you will embrace, and you will dance 
the dance of love and passion. Get ready. On 3, getting up and 
looking at the woman on the right getting up, looking at the woman to 
the left getting up, and you will get together, dancing like you’ve 
never danced before and you dig it.
Here we go. 1-2-3. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. 
Laughter
Yeah. There she is. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. 
Laughter and Applause

Let’s see you move it. Move and groove it babies, come on. Let him 
have it. Oh yeah. You embrace, closer and closer. Do a slow dance 
for us. Twirl around, easily. Come on, whisper sweet nothings in 
each other’s ears. I know you love it. 
On the count of 3, open your eyes, you are stuck together and your 
hands are stuck to the other person. 1-2-3, eyes wide open, and 
you’re stuck to that person, wide awake. Hey, what’s going on here?
Um, she wasn’t what I thought she’d be.
Oh, she wasn’t? What did you think she was going to be?
I was hoping she’d be a lot taller.
A lot taller, but you’re not too disappointed, right? Here, turn around 
here for a second so I can talk to you a little bit better. You’re not 
really disappointed, are you?
Well, it depends on what I wanted.
How about you? You look like you’re having a good time.
Yeah.
Laughter
I don’t really think so, but we’ll go with it anyway. Is this something 
you normally do in public?
Yeah.
How about you? Wide awake, you’re with a guy. Hey, guys. What 
are you doing? What’s happening here? What are you doing with this 
guy?
I don’t know. I don’t think he likes me
You don’t think he likes you. What are you up to here?

Hypno-Heckler
Spencer:
Pick a number, any number, my friend. So do you see what’s happening 
here is that you get the people and you have a little dynamic going on. You 
may have a routine in your mind on something you want to perform, but 
within each routine there is a lot of leeway to improvise. 
I never know what I’m going to do. I just kind of look at the people and I play 
with them, and then I kind of go, what are they going to say? Then I can 
respond to something that they say, whether it’s them or the world’s sexiest 
spy. So there are all these things you can come up with within your mind 
that you can throw in a one-liner or something like that and you can play off 
it.
Now something I like to do in the shows that you saw me here earlier with 
the little heckler, is I like to have somebody out in the audience who gets 
really antagonistic towards me. The reason I do that is because I’ve been 
up here messing with them, and the audience likes to see people finally get 
even with the hypnotist. So I do this because I’m just that kind of a guy. 
Sleep very, very deeply here Doug. 
I’m going to pick him because he’s a big honcho.  
Now listen very carefully, Doug. I’m going to send you back out into 
the audience because I need more room up here. But for now sleep 
very deeply. I’m going to put you out there, but whenever you hear 
me say the words 
, whenever you hear me say 
the words 
, you jump up and you tell me to shut 
up in no uncertain terms.
You just don’t like the way that I say 
. Every time 
I say the words 
, it just irritates you. You just 
don’t like it at all. In fact, you don’t like me. You have no idea why I 
am up here. Whenever I say the words 
, it 
irritates you, and you tell me to shut up in no uncertain terms.
Listen carefully, each time I say it, you get madder and madder. You 
will yell at me. You will say whatever you want to me. You will not 
throw anything at me. 
Remember, I told you earlier about that safety feature?
You will not throw anything at me. You will not spit on me. You will 
not pee on me. You will not shake your thing. You will leave 
Las Vegas, Nevada

everything in place. You can only verbally say and abuse me 
however you want to. 
If you’re in an auditorium and there are children, you’ll say, please watch 
your language. So be respectful of the audience that you’re in at all times.
I’m going to count to 3, I’m going to send you back out into the 
audience. Whenever you hear me say the words 
, it makes you very upset and you tell me to shut up in no 
uncertain terms. 
Finally, if you want to come up here to the stage and you want to 
pick a fight with me. You want to pick a fight with this hypnotist 
because you’re tired of it. You’ve had it, and you want to come up 
here and have a piece of me. 
This guy’s big. I’m taking a risk.
If you try to get up on my stage, you’re going to lose your favorite 
body part. Be very careful. If you try to get up on my stage, you may 
lose your favorite body part.
I’ve had people that don’t care. That’s when it gets scary.
On the count of 3, open your eyes, wide awake. Was it Doug or 
Douglas, what do you prefer?
Doug.
Having a good time so far?
Yeah, it’s fun. 
Yeah, it’s great, huh? Man this is awesome. I like you a lot. You’re a 
good guy, but you keep falling asleep and I need a little bit more 
space up here, so I’m going to have you go back out into the 
audience. Is that cool with you?
Sure.
Maybe I’ll use you later. Maybe you can come back up here, but I 
think you’ll have more fun, okay? 
Okay.
Thanks a lot, man.

Remember what I said earlier, everything is a deepener. Do you remember 
what we did in the preshow? Everything you hear around you makes you go 
deeper into hypnosis. So, during the entire show, no matter where we’re at, 
everything is still happening, it’s still occurring. It doesn’t matter if you’re in 
Timbuktu. It doesn’t matter if you’re in Dubai; LA; Chicago; New York or 
Toronto, Canada. It doesn’t even matter if you’re right here in Las Vegas, 
Nevada.
Be careful how you say that!
Pardon me?
Be careful how you say that.
Doug? Is that you? Be careful about what? Is there something 
wrong?
Oh, be careful.
Okay, that’s cool. No big deal. Anyway, we’re going to go on and we’re 
going to do some more stuff here. Give me another number. And 23 is

You’re only about 6 years old. Happy times only. On the count of 
three, open your eyes, and you’re just little children, and you’re 
having a lot of fun. You guys are all very, very hyper. You can’t sit in 
your chairs very well. You’re moving and fidgeting all over the place. 
Your mind is spinning, and let me tell you something, do not let me 
catch you making faces at me behind my back when I’m talking to 
the audience right here because we will be on TV. You be on your 
very best behavior. If I catch you making faces at me behind my

In a moment, what I’m going to do is I’m going to count to 5. On 
number 5, I will say wide awake. At that time, you will be wide 
awake, feeling fantastic in every way. All the suggestions will now be 
removed. 
So what I’m going to do now is just formal transformation to show you what 
that’s like. Okay? Here we go. 
I’m going to count from 1-5. On number 5, you will be wide awake 
and feeling fantastic in every single way. Before I do though, I want 
you to go inside your body and I want you to find one thing that you’d 
want to change in your lives more than anything. Maybe you want 
more confidence, more success whatever that is, find that right now. 
When you have that in your mind, nod your head. Do it quickly. Very 
cool.
I want you to take that thought, and I want you to breathe into it. Give 
it energy, give it life, send it into the future and attach a powerful 
emotion to it. 
We’re anchoring into a beautiful state now. All right. I like to do that at the 
end of the show. I want them to feel good about it, feel that with you.
In a moment, I’m going to count from 1-5. On number 5, open your 
eyes, feeling fantastic in every way, accepting one more powerful 
round of applause from the audience because you guys were the 
stars of the show. When you hear this round of applause, it will 
cement in your mind this idea that you want for yourself. Get ready 
now. On number 5, open your eyes, feeling fantastic in every single 
way.
You will keep that one suggestion I gave you however. Here we go. 
1-2-3-4-5, wide awake, you guys.

Okay, so do you guys have a general idea of how that works, right? So now
you’ve got something going on in your mind. Do you have a question? You 
better stand up. Take this. And what is it very quickly. We’re running out of 
time.
I noticed when you say sleep, and everyone is in a trance, they really kind 
of fall down and really slouch, instead of just going and sitting like that. If 
they do kind of just fall around and you kind of position them so they’re lying 
down, is that so the audience thinks that they’re really kind of asleep, or so 
that they are asleep, or is it better to have them in a really sleeping, 
slouching position than just kind of sitting like this?
It doesn’t really matter. It’s your show. All it is for me is just about 
showmanship, and it looks fun. I could take people and drop them over like
this or I can put them this way, or I can put them upside down on their head, 
or I can throw them on the floor. It just depends on what the feel of your 
show is at the moment. That was just something I’m doing here, playing 
around. 
Maybe during the real show, I’ll just keep everybody in their chairs. So 
much is dependent upon your subjects. You may walk into a room to do a 
show, have everything in your mind exactly how you want it, but you’re 
going to have subjects that are going to test and try everything you know 
about stage hypnosis. You may have to shift everything you’re doing on a 
dime. 
When the girls started fighting or kicking around, maybe it got out of control, 
what would you do to calm that down?
Oh I don’t know. I just let it go on for a while. The reason I do that is 
because the audience, tell me, did you guys think that was pretty cool to 
watch them just get goofy. 
Yeah.
Because I’m trying to do a show so it looks like they’re out of control. Listen, 
they think they’re 6 years old, so let them play like little kids. I’ve got a 6-
year-old. He gets goofy sometimes. I don’t care. Just be goofy.
Yeah, but what it started getting a little too physical, pulling hair…
Oh, I’ve had that happen.

Really?
Oh yeah, yeah. They can get real ugly.
You just let them go?
No, I don’t let them go. I might just go, sleep!
Yeah, stop it.
Then I’ll say, now listen very carefully. No pulling hair. 
Right.  
Wide awake, children. So you just handle the situation that way because 
you don’t want anybody to get hurt, the volunteers, they’re back there 
having a cat fight. Any other questions?

You guys are ready for an early night, aren’t you?
Yes.
Okay. Well, this has been a good day. You have a lot of information to think 
about. We’re going to send you off here soon. But I want you to think of 
everything that you’ve learned today with what we’ve presented to you, and 
let that roll around in your mind. As it rolls around in your mind, it’s going to 
be very powerful. You’ll have the dreams again, and if you haven’t had 
them, they’re going to happen.
And when you close your eyes and think about it, how good it feels…
Once again…
To finally end the day.
Moving.
And everything continues to flow.
Just calm.
Easily.
And just pause with your eyes closed.
All the way.
And drift deeper.
That’s right. Enjoy that feeling. That’s right. Enjoy that feeling.
That’s right. 
Deeper. That’s good.
The more you drift…
The more you let go.
The better you feel.

It’s unbelievable, isn’t it?
So whenever you’re ready to accept these ideas, to become a firm deep-
lasting impression on your subconscious mind, then your eyes will open up, 
and they’ll open up at that moment when you’ve accepted these ideas and 
you know that they have been instilled deep inside of yourself. At that 
moment, you can come all the way back. 
Whew. Is it me, or is it hot in here? Are all the eyes almost open? So how 
are you guys doing? Want to try that again? How are you guys doing?
Applause
All right, guys I think you deserve a slightly early break today. Have a great 
night. Those of you who want to go and do some street hypnosis well, you 
can let us know about it tomorrow. Off you go.

DVD 12 – The Complete Guide to Setting Up Your Own Show

Start Of Day
Do you all feel like you’re hypnotists now? It’s a progressive thing you know, 
you go from point A to point Z, and I don’t know what you all did this morning 
but when I walked in it looked like you all were doing some stage hypnosis 
work. Is that correct?
Yes.
So, at this point I’m curious, how many of you feel like you could walk out of 
here and do a stage show? Right on, I like it.
Can we have time to go find cute outfits?
I’ll tell you what, there are some really awesome outfits around here, I’ve 
been walking around looking at a lot of these stores and they have some 
nice clothes for the guys, ladies whoa! They’re open late. 
Are they open late?
No, Victoria Secret isn’t the place to get clothes for the stage, that’s where 
you get your undies. But they have some great clothes and if you want some 
really cool clothes for the stage, figure you’ll put out around $2000 to $5000. 
You can do less then that, but for some really funky stuff you can do it for 
about a grand, or $500. 
A lot of things I do is, go to old thrift stores to find old funky jackets and stuff, 
because I can get those for under $100, like $30-$40. I’ve got some of the 
coolest coats just from thrift stores. Especially if you live in L.A., I mean go 
down to Melrose. They have places there in Santa Monica, some funky 
stores down there, but any city will have them.
I live in this little place called Kalispell, Montana and I found a jacket down in 
Missoula, which is about 2 hrs south of there. They have this store there with 
this cool old velvet jackets and stuff, so I picked up a couple because I 
thought they were cool. I don’t know if I’ll ever use them, but I like them.
Before I take any questions I want to go a little further, because what we’re 
going to focus on here for the next while in this segment is this. We’re going 
to go over the anatomy of what it’s like to set up a show. You already know 
how to do a show, you’re already there. 

344
What goes on in the background? We’ve got music laid out here for you. We 
have music running and you all just do your thing, but what do I do when I 
have to find a DJ? For years I had a sound guy. In fact, I’ve had many 
different sound technicians. The last guy that worked with me was Dave, who 
was with me for 6 ½ years. He traveled all over the world with me, he was a 
good guy. 
Whenever I had a gig I’d just call him on the phone and say hey Dave man, 
we’re going to the Caribbean do you want to go? He’d say yeah. I go do you 
think your wife will mind? I don’t care, I’m there with you bro. It’s cool to have 
somebody to work with that knows your routine and is free to travel with you. 
So if you don’t have a sound technician that works with you all the time that 
can run your sound, lighting, etc. then option number two is, when you go to 
a different city is to hire a local DJ. Hire somebody to work for you. Most 
good DJ’s, you can spend a half hour with them, go over your show with 
them and they have it down tight. A good DJ is worth $100 to $300, whatever 
they charge, but I don’t think you’ll pay more than $300. 
Although, I think when I was in Dubai, these guys charged a lot of money. I 
think they were charging like 1000 dirham per night, so I was paying them 
about $360 per night, not too bad. Then I had assistants, models that worked 
in the show as well, which is a nice touch, but it’s worth it to put on a good 
presentation.

345
For Wall A Show
We’re not going to get into that part yet, let’s get into the part where we just 
go into a theater or into the Elks Lodge, high school or whatever it is. Or, for 
those of you who are more, high spirited, you go to a place in whatever town 
you’re in and promote your own show. You rent a hall and set up everything 
yourself. You take all the risk. Everything is you. 
It’s called for-walling, which is when you go into a location, rent a room, pay 
for all the advertising, do all the promotion, do all the ticketing sales, etc. it’s 
all on you. Of course, when you do for-walling you get people to go out there 
and work for you. You network it and delegate responsibilities to people. You 
build a crew around you to help you to reach your goals and you compensate 
everybody accordingly, because that’s what you need to do.
Let’s go like this for a second. Let’s pretend I’m a hypnotist and I’m going all 
right, I need $5000 next week because I’m going to have some teeth pulled. 
Everybody has something happening, like I want to buy a new dog or maybe 
I want to buy a motorcycle or, if I’m a lady maybe I want to buy some new 
clothes, new shoes.
So you think like this, this is how I think, I need this much money $5000 in 
the next week, how am I going to produce that? Then I look around, you 
know I live in Kalispell, so let’s just say I’m not on the road traveling around 
the world doing what I want to do so I want to get a local gig in Kalispell, for 
example, because that’s close.
I do shows there about twice a year because I live there and people love it. I 
love working in smaller venues. I like working with a close audience. Here’s 
what I do. First, I contact the venue. The venue I happen to use there is the 
Elk’s Lodge. Why do I use that? It’s the only decent venue in town. It reminds 
me of an old dive bar. Everything is red velvet, but they have a nice stage 
with a nice backdrop, so it all works out good. 
I’ll get 300-400 people coming to the show, all paying $15 apiece, which isn’t 
a bad night. I don’t have to do much to promote it because everybody there 
knows who I am, it’s a small community and word spreads like wildfire. If you 
do the math that’s $6000 and of that I’ll probably spend $500 on advertising, 
which brings it down to $5500. That’s not too bad.
But, once I get there to do the show then I have my back room sales where I 
usually pick up an extra $500 or $1000 there. Not a bad way to go right? 
Could you do that once a week yourself?
Yes!

346
Spencer:

Spencer:
Here’s what I do in that regards.
I’ll find the venue, call them up and make a date. Now, a lot of times, what 
really frustrates me is that they want to charge me for a room. I don’t want to 
have to pay for a room. I want to get it for free, I don’t want to pay anywhere 
from $200 to $1000. Wouldn’t that be cool to be able to walk into a place and 
get a room free?
Yeah.
The alternative to that is to go somewhere and have someone hire you, 
which can also happen. I’m a risk taker though, for the most part. The bigger 
the risk the bigger the profit, that’s just the way it is. So I’ve got the room and 
I talk to them. 
I say Lori, hey it’s Spencer and I’m thinking about doing another show there. 
We did a great job last time and I know I brought in so many people that you 
all probably sold out $5000 or $6000 in booze in the back room. I’m thinking 
about coming back again, do you think we can have that room for nothing 
this time? Of course, so they give me the room for nothing, that’s how I 
approach it.
If you go to hotels it’s the same thing. A lot of times hotels will say well, we’re 
going to charge you $300 for the room, $400 for the room for the evening 
and I always go you know what though, and I make sure if it’s a hotel that 
they have a bar there. I want it catered, because you’re going to have adults 
and they’ll want a drink.
So I’ll say listen, I’m bringing 400-500 people to my show and they’re all 
going to be drinking, so why don’t we have a cash bar in the back of the 
room. This is how it normally works out. If you have a cash bar in the back of 
the room, people buy booze and what happens then is you have to match 
the cost of the room with the sale of the booze and you’ll be covered, 
wherein they usually won’t ask you for a dime. Does that make sense?
Yes.
That’s one of the easiest ways to approach hotels and properties. If you 
approach one that doesn’t want to work with you then go somewhere else. 
Or, if you can’t find one then you don’t pay the $300. You have to do the 
math and calculate it for yourself.
So I’ve got my room at the Elks. Now I have to find somebody to run my 
sound. If I don’t know anybody I go on the Internet first and look around for 
local DJs. I want to see their websites, who they are and what they’re doing. 
You have to use the Internet folks, that’s a major resource and the one you 
need.

347
I put ads on Craig’s List. Hey, need a DJ for a comedy hypnosis show 
coming up in two months. Go to my website and send me an email. So I 
receive emails with references and I take it from there to determine who I 
want to hire. We negotiate a price and that’s it. I ask them, what do you want 
to charge? Oh, $300 which is insane. Do you know where we are? This is 
Kalispell and nobody gets $300 for doing this, but I’ll give you $150 and they 
say okay.
It’s all about negotiation. No matter what we do it’s always about negotiation. 
Since you’re the one doing the job and the hiring, you have the greater 
negotiating skills right? So it’s all about business and you keep it that way. 
It’s nothing personal. Everybody wants to make a buck. 
Then, I’ll put another ad on Craig’s List. You need to use this it’s a great way 
to promote yourself. I’ll put something on there under events in this city. 
Coming to this city, comedy hypnosis show with Spencer, the world’s fastest 
hypnotist, tickets now available online. Then I’ll go look for a street team that 
sells tickets. Contact me. Compensation zero. What will you get for it? If you 
bring people to my show I’ll give you $2 to $5 for everyone you bring to the 
show.
Then I print out coupons and send it to them online, a little piece of paper 
with a code on them. They print them and hand them out and they take the 
risk just like I do. It costs me nothing except a few minutes of my time to 
develop the little coupons.
Say again where you’re getting the crew to do that work is that on Craig’s 
List?
Yes, that’s where I go. In any major city that I go to, whether it’s Salt Lake, 
L.A., New York, Chicago or Atlanta, it doesn’t matter. 
What’s the listing you run?
I list it under events, crew or gigs. It’s easy that way, because anymore 
people go to the Internet and savvy people use Craig’s List and I want 
people who are savvy that use the Internet. Because people on the Internet 
are on social media and they work it hard.
If you have these people out and they’re selling tickets, are they collecting 
the money and how do you get the money from them?
They’re not collecting a dime, I’m no fool. All they’re doing is passing out 
discount coupons to people. Then the people bring the coupons and pay at 
the door or they can go to my website and buy them from there. No, don’t 
ever give another person the power to take your money, that’s a big huge 
mistake.

You said a line crew. How would you advertise for a street crew? What was 
the name you associated with them, the one’s that sell the tickets?
I just say I’m looking for a street team to help promote a comedy hypnosis 
show.
Okay.
There are all kinds of people out there that are, just as happy as bugs to do 
it. Women who want part-time income, work from your home, you don’t have 
to go anywhere. All you have to do is be a social butterfly and women are 
just that.
What does the street team actually do?
They promote the show by handing out flyers and posters. They put them 
everywhere, every street corner, café, beauty shop, every story, on every 
windshield, etc. they plaster the town that I’ll be appearing in. Because when 
I go into that town I want to see my face everywhere. When I drive down the 
street, I want to look in that store window and see my face. If I walk into a 
barber shop I want to see my face.
So you make up these coupons, give them to the street crew, who passes 
them out to generally anybody and everybody, as many as they can and you 
say there’s a code on that coupon, so you know it came from them obviously 
and you pay them for each coupon that came from them. 
What about the people that are walking in the front door and paying $12, as 
opposed to the people who got in for the discounted $6?
I make an extra $2 right. It doesn’t matter to me. Nobody cares. It’s the same 
thing here in Vegas some people have discount coupons and some people 
pay full price.

How To Hire A DJ
Let’s get back to the business of the DJ. How do you work with a DJ and how 
do you find a DJ? You find a DJ by going to the yellow pages or the Internet. 
You call them up and say hey, Mr. DJ. My name is Spencer, I’m a hypnotist 
and I’m coming to your town to do a comedy hypnosis show. 
My first question is have you ever worked with a hypnotist? No. Have you 
ever seen a hypnosis show? Oh yeah, I’ve seen them on YouTube they’re 
pretty cool, or yeah when I was in high school I saw one and it was a blast.
I say great, then you have an idea of what a hypnosis show is like, I can work 
with that. My second question is this. What kind of a sound system do you 
have? Most DJ’s love a decent sound system, so I want to make sure they 
have at least two 15” speakers to go out on the side, powered through an 
amplifier instead of self powered. 
I want to make sure they have two monitors that come up on the stage, 
because when you’re working with people you want monitors on the stage 
facing the subjects so the subjects can hear what you’re saying. If you have 
your speakers out here pointing towards the audience, the audience can 
hear what you’re saying, but it sometimes becomes muffled for the guys up 
here trying to listen to you.
So, if you have monitors on the stage pointing towards your subjects, they’ll 
be able to hear clearly what you’re saying and they need to hear clearly. If 
they can’t clearly hear what you’re saying, you may lose them, they may 
come out of trance and you’ll have less people up here on your stage which 
will affect your show and your presentation.
So my questions to Mr. DJ are what kind of sound system do you have? I 
want to make sure we’re on the same page. Also, I carry my own mics 
because I like my own. I have a wireless headset, a handheld wireless and 
another one that’s hardwired that has a line on it which goes directly to the 
mixing board. 
The reason I had that one hardwired is because sometimes you may run into 
an area where you get a lot of scrambled signals, so if that’s the case then 
your headset or wireless mic may not work efficiently. I use that as a backup, 
just in case I need to have something hardwired. It won’t happen often, but 
could happen, so that’s something to keep in mind when you’re doing a 
show.
So, I got Mr. DJ and I’m happy. My next question is do you know how to use 
a computer. Trust me, some people still don’t. Are you familiar with Macs? I’ll 
tell you why I ask. 

350
When I go do a show and I have my DJ that I’ve hired, I say because you’re 
going to be running the show. I say I don’t need your equipment, everything 
runs from my laptop. Everything I need to run my hypnosis show is in here. 
All the music is here with a line that goes to my mixing board and everything 
goes through there.
Back in the old days I used to use CD players. That no longer works and 
they have other things people used to use, but I’ve found for me, my Mac is 
the easiest way to run your show is on a laptop. I use iTunes. I also use 
another program called DJ. It’s a cool program for Mac. But, if you’re a 
Windows person, they have software available that you can use too that will 
work for you and is just as cool as what we have for the Macs.
I’m not a PC guy so I don’t know what they are, but I know PC guys have 
them. The guys I work with do have PCs with iTunes, so I give them my 
playlist to put on their computers and we run the show. However, my first 
preference in finding a DJ for me is that they need to have a Mac, because if 
they have a Mac then I know we are brothers. If you’re a Mac person you 
know what I’m talking about, we’re a cult. 
So I’ve got my DJ and have this going on, let’s do this.
What’s a good one where you don’t get a lot of interference?
Shop around there are different ones out there. Audiotechnica makes a good 
one; there are a few different kinds available. For a good mic you’ll spend 
$600 for a decent one, because you want to make sure it projects, especially 
if you’re in a large auditorium that seats a couple thousand, that it projects 
good.
But, on the other hand, if you go into a large theater like that, they will usually 
have all the equipment that you could possibly need. I just have backups for 
everything. I have two complete sound systems, because I used to work in a 
huge theater. I’ve got a garage full of big speakers, amplifiers, everything you 
could think of needing.
Shop around, fit your budget just don’t go to Radio Shack. I’m not saying 
that’s a bad thing but you want somebody a little more high-end for what 
you’re doing, because you have to come across nice, crisp and clear.
I have a suggestion. I run sound equipment for my shows now and I use a 
program called Sound Plant and they just came out with a Mac version. It 
makes your entire keyboard a macro, which means if I tell somebody to 
press #1 and my music will come on, when they press 1 the music comes 
on. If they press it again the music crescendo’s out and it’s over with, fading 
itself out.

This is a program for PCs and they just came out with one for Mac. Write that 
down, research it and see how it works for you.
The other thing that’s nice about it, the old version– I already have the new 
version since I had the old version– but it’s just been put out recently to 
purchase. The new version will actually have the words of the songs on your 
keys on the screen and the keyboard on your screen will be the full size of 
your screen, which makes it super easy for anyone to work it from high 
school to senior, because it’ll all be right there on your screen.
Very good, thanks. 
Real quick, how about remote. Would you recommend that, where you 
control it?
My recommendation for that is no. Some people use it. I think if you want to 
be a professional then be professional and hire somebody to run it. It looks 
better that way and you’re not bogged down with having to fool with it, etc. 
I’ve seen some people who have this little thing up on stage, they press a 
button and want to do the whole thing to save some money, but save 
yourself the headaches and get someone to do it for you. It makes more 
sense and looks better.
Would it make sense to have your own DJ or does that not make sense cost-
wise, to have your own DJ so he knows your music and travels around with 
you?
If you can afford it, by all means, do. If you have someone who’s available to 
travel with you all the time heck yeah, why not? I had a guy with me like I 
said for 6 ½ years. He started as a friend. He went to the Army, got out of the 
Army, he took a liking to me, he attended my shows and one day when one 
of the guys working for me couldn’t make it, he asked if he could try and I 
gave him a chance.
He did a good job and we got along well, so he stuck with me and wherever I 
went he went too. He liked doing it.
Is it expense?
Well, it’s not really expensive. It doesn’t cost you anything, for example, if 
you’re going to another location, getting hired to do a show then you put that 
into the cost. I need an extra plane ticket or hotel room, it’s the way it is and 
they pay for it. You just add that into your expenses.
If I’m paying for it, I want to make sure I’ll make enough money to cover my 
butt on him. I even have someone who can keep other people away from me 
when doing a show. Because when you’re a performer doing entertainment 
everybody wants a piece of you.

352
It’s nice to have someone and Dave is a big Ex-Marine, kind of intimidating 
looking and would always keep people away. Plus, he was big and strong, so 
he could lift all the equipment. He would set everything up and then all I had 
to do was my show. That’s what you need to do is be able to walk into a 
room and just do your show. 
Have a good sound person. Let them set up everything and tear it down, 
your job is to perform, do your show and be the stage hypnotist. You don’t 
really want to have to involve yourself with all the other things. But, you are 
going to learn all those things because if you don’t know that then you can’t 
teach it to somebody else. 
So, we’re finding our DJ. Let’s do this. I need somebody who wants to play 
with me. 
Laughter
Not like that. You guys, I can’t say anything.

Train Your DJ
Let’s just imagine that he’s a DJ.
Applause
He’s a DJ and let’s just pretend I’m talking to you. So you’re a DJ right?
Yes.
Cool. What have you done in the past?
Lots of shows.
Cool, have you ever worked with a hypnotist?
Many.
So you kind of have an idea of how that goes. 
I love Macs.
I dig it. That’s going to work very well for me. Here’s what I want to do. I’m 
going to go through my show with you very quickly. Let’s run through it so 
you get it in your mind. I’m going to show you how that works.
Let’s just imagine that we’re in a theater or something. I’m going to pull out 
my Mac and I usually like we’re at a table, so let’s bring the table up here 
and make this look just as real as we can. This is all preshow stuff. We’re 
getting setup, we’ve gone to the Elks Lodge to get everything ready and I’m 
pulling up my Mac. We’re going to open up my iTunes because that’s where 
I keep everything, and I have another program called DJ, which is an 
awesome program and the one I like to work with.
I click on my comedy hypnosis show and everything is right here. What I 
like to do is go through all my routines with the guy running my show. Let 
me give you an idea of what that’s like when I have somebody fresh out of 
nowhere, because I want them to know what it’s like.
So, we have our opening stuff that we do here. This is our opening show, so 
when the show begins I’ll be bringing people in and they’ll be listening to 
this stuff here, so we’re doing this. This is where people are coming in and 
sitting down, they just want their minds tweaked.

When we begin and after I get people hypnotized we’ll use this one here, 
which is the opening mix. Then, about 11 minutes into the show the music 
shifts.
Eleven minutes?
Just let this music place, because you’ll introduce me, I’m going to come up 
at this point and you can just let this music play. You can see where it shifts 
at nine minutes and 20 seconds, so you don’t have to do anything because 
I’m up there and will be talking to the audience, like this.
During this first part– go back to the beginning of the audio please–
Nine, twenty.
During this part right here, I’ll be out here talking to the people doing what I 
call a preshow thing where I’ll be talking about hypnosis. I’ll be saying okay 
everybody puts your hands above your head, squeeze your hands together 
as tightly as you can to help me get some good subjects. 
Once I get my subjects I’m going to bring them up on stage. You don’t have 
to do anything with this music, because once they’re up on stage I’ve got it 
set where the music is going to make a transition naturally, so you don’t 
even have to deal with it. That makes it easy for you it’s like a no-brainer. 
So it just goes on and then when we get to this point here, the music slows 
down and during this point, after I get people on stage, I’m going to 
hypnotize them by doing a little induction, telling them to relax, breathe in 
and out and all this kind of stuff. You’ve seen a show so you know what I’m 
talking about.
Yeah.
So when I have everyone just where I want them, they’re hypnotized and 
I’m ready to go to the next level, then we’re going to go to the next one. Let 
me show you how this works, because this is how I do it. I’m going to say 
okay cool, it looks like we’ve got some good subjects. In a moment I’m 
going to count to three and on number three, everybody sit up in your chair, 
open your eyes and we’re going to go on a little car rid. 
On three sit in your chair, we’re going to go for a car ride. So you can see 
here I’ve got this queued up where it says car ride. It’s pretty easy, it’s going 
to go like this. I’m going to go I’m going to count to three, everybody sit up 
in your chair. When I begin to count one, I want you to make that transition 
so it’s already going.
Alex:
Spencer:
Alex:
Spencer:
Alex:
Spencer:

355
Let’s imagine them doing that. I’m going to count to three, sit up in your 
chairs let’s go for a car ride. One, make the transition please. Scroll down 
you can do it. 
Let that go. So they’re doing that and I’m going to run through this routine 
with people. Then when I’m done with the routine I’m just going to say 
sleep. When I say sleep this stops.
You don’t want to do it.
I’ve got another program I don’t have up here right now, it’s not a big deal, 
but I have a background tune. Just put it on this one, add it to the left please 
and I’ll have that set for you later, but that’s something in the background. 
This goes between every skit that I do, so that’s how that works. 
Now I need to get ready for the next one, so what I want you to do is go 
down here.
Band play.
Yes, let’s do that one. So in a moment, at the count of three, everybody sit 
up in your chairs, you’re going to be in a band. You’ve got drum sticks in 
your hands, I want to see you now put the drum sticks in your hands and 
roam around a little bit, crack your knuckles and get ready for this because 
you can win a million bucks if you have what it takes. 
I’ll count to three, sit up in your chairs, play the drums, here we go 1-2-3 
and you’re already there see how that works? We’re just going to make 
those transitions like that very fast. Now, during this bit right here I’m going 
to do one thing. During this bit right here they’ll be drumming and stuff and 
I’m going to say freeze and when I do just hit the space bar.
Then I’ll talk to people for a second and they’re going to freeze, they’ll be 
really animated and in all these weird positions. Then I’m going to give them 
another suggestion and then say ‘now play’, so when I say play again then 
hit it. And ‘now play’ and then we’re going to go through this and let this 
happen. 
When I’m done with this routine I’m going to say and ‘wide awake’ and all 
this applause is for you, which takes you back to the regular music. You just 
have to have that prepared and there again, I’ll have that on a separate 
track so everything flows naturally.
It always goes back to that?
Alex:
Spencer:
Alex:
Spencer:
Alex:

356
Spencer:
Students:
Spencer:
Students:
Spencer:
Yes. In a moment I’m going to count to three, everybody sit up in your 
chairs, we’re going to go for a little horse ride. Get ready on three. Make 
sure you have your leathers and boots on. On three, let’s go for that horse 
ride, it’s an old dusty trail 1-2-3. Easy.
Let’s go to what is important, because I think you’ve got this down really 
well and what I want to do now is go to where it is an important part of it and 
that’s really, just the end of it. To me, what’s important in the show is the 
beginning and ending of the show. I want to leave something happening at 
the end, because it’s very important how this transitions.
At the end of it you see where it says wake up, if you could scroll down 
there. There you go, hang onto that. At the end of the show something 
happens here. I’m going to say, ‘because everybody’s been with me for a 
long time, they’ve been hypnotized, you’ve been doing all these routines but 
now the show is coming to an end’, so this is what I want to do.
You have to pay attention. In just a moment I’m going to count from one to 
five and then I will say wide awake. When I say that to you I’m going to look 
at you and I’m going to look at you every time I do a routine, because I want 
to make sure we’re on the same page.
For example, when I say in a moment I’m going to count to three and you’re 
in a car, I’ll be looking at you and when you’re ready you’re going to 
go…because then I know I can proceed with the routine. I don’t want you 
looking around, because when I say three I want those people doing what I 
tell them to do and everything has to coordinate exactly.
Does this make sense to everyone?
Yes.
Are you finding this helpful?
Yes.
Okay, because when you step into a room and you’re working with a DJ, 
you’ve got to have everything setup perfectly. When I do a show I’m a 
perfectionist, man I want things tight. I want things to happen the way I want 
them to happen. 
So, at the end of the show when I’m done with everything, here’s what’s 
going to happen. People are going to be sitting there and I’m going to give 
everybody a gift. I’m going to tell everybody, sit back in your chair, put your 
arm above your head and make a tight fist. I’m going to say I want you to go 
inside right now and find one thing you want to change in your life. 

357
Maybe you want more confidence, more motivation or more success, 
whatever that is find it right now. When you have that in your mind breathe 
into it deeply. They’ll be breathing in you can see it and I’ll say very cool. 
In just a moment I’m going to count from one to five and then I will say wake 
up. Play it. When I point to you I’ll say wake up. Very cool. Then I’ll say 
wake up at that time and everybody will be wide awake feeling fantastic in 
every way, all the suggestions will now be removed.
That’s how that goes. Pretty simple. Then I’m going to keep talking to the 
people, this song keeps playing it’s a very powerful song which leads to a 
crescendo and then I dismiss everybody. Then when that’s done I have 
music that plays after that and you have nothing else you have to do, 
except sit back and drink a beer.
Too easy.
All right man it works, nice.
Applause
This is how I approach it every time. Sometimes it may take me 20 minutes 
or sometimes even a couple of hours. 
For example, when I was in Dubai, I was in a different level of this. This is 
like if I’m working in a local club or something like that, I can do it very 
quickly with a good smart DJ. In Dubai it was different because I was 
working with people from different countries with different languages and I 
had a sound person who was running the sound. I had a lighting director 
who was running all the lights, because we had these beautiful overhead 
lights.
Gels and then everything that’s coming down on the stage; I’ll set a curtain 
person because we had a large curtain in the back that had to go up at a 
specific time, because in my show I have a big drop down screen with a 
large video presentation that starts before the show even begins. 
Then, when people come into the theater I’ve got this huge screen (movie 
theater screen) that comes down and I have this video presentation that I 
developed, where if people come in there they get mesmerized for about 20 
minutes. It puts them into a hypnotic state of mind or into my kind of 
weirdness. It’s a very weird video, but its’ a lot of fun, so they watch that. 
So, I have that and then I also have a stage assistant who’s a lovely lady. 
The purpose of the assistant is for eye candy and somebody you can play 
off of. She does a couple different things or if you’re a lady, you may want a 
guy to be your assistant, which can look good too.
Alex:
Spencer:
[

358
The purpose of the assistant is to keep everybody under control up here on 
the stage. If anybody falls off, you get them back on their chairs. And, of 
course, I do some routines with my assistant that, of course, excites the 
imaginations of my audience in different ways.
So I have all these people I need to coordinate and work with. What I do is 
go down on the stage and I’ve got my crew up in the sound booth and I go 
over the entire show from the very beginning of it until the very end, 
because I want to make sure all the sound is tight.
When you’re in a big room like that and you don’t have a DJ who’s close to 
you, he’s at the other end of the theater, then you want to make sure you 
can see him, they can see you and the show is tight, because you’re 
coordinating it with a lot of different people. So it’s a different arena then just 
working by yourself into a smaller venue when you’re getting into a bigger 
theater like that. It’s a lot of fun.
So, I will spend an hour maybe two, going over the entire production and I’ll 
go over it several times until I feel like everybody’s on the same page as I 
am. When you’re doing a performance like that, you want it to be really 
smooth, because people are coming there and paying $60 a ticket. That’s a 
lot of money, so you want to make sure you have it down tight.

359
Show Q&As
Are there any questions to what we’ve covered up to this point? If so please 
raise your hands. 
Do you have any recommendations for lighting, if you’re working in those 
situations?
Lighting will depend on the venue that you’re in. If you’re in a large theater, 
when I do shows, talking about lighting I always want all the lighting down in 
the room, except on the stage. I just want lighting up on the stage area and 
that’s it.
Why?
Because I don’t want people looking around at each other. I want all the 
folks to be up here. This is where people need to be paying attention right 
here on the stage, on you the performer, and your subjects. This is where 
it’s all happening, so I darken the entire room and keep lights on only on the 
stage area.
Now you know if you’re in a hotel ballroom like this or if you’re in a local 
club, you may not be able to do that. The way around that is to bring in your 
own lights. You can have some lights on stands that are placed in various 
locations, all pointing to the stage. You can have some little cans and gels 
with different colors on there. My colors are blue, red and yellow, depending 
on what I want to create.
It depends on how high tech you want to get with your show. You can do it 
anywhere from, just coming into a place like that with all the lights on, have 
a bunch of chairs up here, do a show and have a great time, still making a 
ton of money. It doesn’t matter how you do it. 
If you want to take it to a higher, more professional level and be like a 
hypno-God, then you want to do it right. Then you have a crew, a huge 
theater, it’s opulent and looks great. You’re dressed to the max…when I do 
my shows on those kinds of stages I have this wonderful velvet jacket I 
wear with leather pants. It looks good and it’s a lot of fun.
It’s a whole different level of showmanship. If I go into a local club or 
something like that, I wear a pair of Levi’s and a shirt but I still look good, 
because you don’t want to look bad. The rule of thumb in any kind of 
presentation is, always look better than your audience. Anybody can hire a 
plain Jane person to go into a performance.

Igor went over how to use copyright free music, but if we want to use 
copyrighted music how do we start going about doing that for the show?
Listen, when I first started doing this I had that conflict so what I did was to 
call and ask specifically. I told them I was a stage hypnotist, I’m doing 
shows and they asked me what I did. I told them I used various parts of a 
song in my routine and they said don’t worry about it it’s not a problem. 
That’s what they told me. Yourself, you may want to check on that yourself.
I have been in clubs, this has happened, even in a nightclub, if a band is in 
there playing a cover song of some rock n’ roll group but they don’t have a 
license, they can get sued. Technically and legally, they have to have a 
license in every nightclub to play music, even if it’s on a juke box. It can get 
pretty nasty that way. 
However, I’ve never had a problem with that and I did call and check on that 
for myself, because I didn’t want to have a problem with that. There’s a few 
of them out there that have the rights for different artists, just cover yourself. 
I doubt that you’ll ever have a problem with it, but it’s certainly worth 
checking into.
Again, I think I mentioned yesterday, when I did a show for Playboy that 
they threw away all my music and said here, you’ll be using this music 
because we use it to televise around the world.
Before you were talking about for walls, renting your own hall, etc. The 
question I want to ask, I don’t know if it means I’m getting ahead of myself 
or if anybody thought about that. How do you integrate dances, eye candy 
and the sexy girls dancing, before the show goes on and all this happening 
before you even walk out on stage, to get the audience pumped up before 
you get into your show? 
To keep it simple right now, if you want to go into all of that then I really 
recommend getting the mentoring program where we could really go into 
depth on that and I can help you create your own specific persona. What I 
would do at this point before you get there is K.I.S.S. (keep it simple).
You don’t need to do all that. It’s as simple as, if I just want to do the Elks in 
Kalispell, Montana. So there it’s not a big deal; it’s just an Elks Lodge, 
population grizzly bears. What I’ll do there is get everything setup, I’ll get a 
DJ, I’ve got a gal up there and three people that have worked for me in the 
past.
They all do a fantastic job and they’ll go in there to get everything setup, I 
don’t have to do anything, they’ll just go in and play whatever funky music 
they want to and then about 20 minutes before the show I have my own 
music that I want them to play. Because I want to put everybody into my 
mindset and it helps me to immensely prepare for what I’m going to do. 

361
That’s all I do and when the last one of my songs comes on they announce 
me…
…then we go on from there.
The eye candy stuff is something different. Could I have an assistant there? 
Sure I could, so for example, if I had somebody working with me in that 
capacity. For example, you’ll see I have a video of the show I did in Dubai, 
it’s on my site at SleepNow.com, from beginning to end. You’ll see what my 
assistant does there. 
After my video presentation goes away, the screen goes up, I come out this 
way from behind the chairs and there’s an opening and she comes from this 
side stage right, takes a chair and puts it back in so all the chairs are lined 
up together. Her job is to stay in the background over here all the time, until 
I ask her to do something specifically.
What I do with her during the show, when people are sitting in the chairs…I 
always say during the show, ‘
. 
She looks pretty hot and is dressed appropriately for the show, so she’s 
always going back to touch them on the shoulder and saying relax. She 
smells good, who wouldn’t want to be touched by that. Relax and people 
just kind of melt since it feels good. Does that help? 
That’s the capacity I use her in, it’s a lot of fun and she also brings me 
props when I need them. When I need the handheld mic she brings it to me 
so I don’t have to do anything. When I’m done with it I’ll be talking to the 
audience, I’ll make a motion and she’ll come and take it from me, making it 
look like a natural part of what I’m doing. Of course, everybody wants to 
look at her again anyway, so it’s all good.  
In reference to the music, I noticed you play Axle F while making a 
suggestion, is that like an anchor for the subjects as well, to know the 
suggestion is coming up?
It’s just the background music. You can use any kind of music you want. 
But you play the same music every time?
Yes. I have four different background things, I don’t even use that one 
anymore, but as a demonstration I have something else I created. I have 
my own music I use for my show. I use that as something that flows through 
the entire show, so when I’m done with a skit then that music plays and 
people all know it.
ladies and gentleman, welcome to the hypnosis show here in Kalispell, 
Montana. Do me a favor and give him a powerful round of applause, make 
him feel good
during your time with me here, at the sound of 
my voice and touch of my hand, the music simply helps you to go deeper 
and deeper into sleep. Whenever my assistant touches you on your 
shoulders and tells you to relax, just let go even more

So yes, it’s like an anchor so it becomes an anchor, because it’s like yeah, 
we know what’s going to happen next. 
Do any of the venues that you go to require that you have insurance? Do 
you carry insurance? Is that something we should consider as well for 
liability?
That’s a very important question let me answer that for you. Yes, you 
should carry insurance.
Where do we get that?
There are a few places available. One place to go to is Clowns of the USA. 
There’s another one, but I can’t think of who they are, because they had this 
big insurance fight about six months ago. They carry specialty insurance for 
stage hypnotists it’s a $2 million policy and will cost you about $200 a year. 
It’s not that big a deal, if something happens you want your ass covered.
Protect yourself and the people and truthfully, a lot of places won’t let you 
perform unless you have that. You can go into a bar and they probably 
won’t ask you for it, Elks Lodges and places like that, but if you go to 
colleges they’ll ask for the writer. If you go to big theaters they too will ask 
for the writer. If you go to Dubai, you ain’t working there without a writer or 
somebody who sponsors you into the country anyway.
If you go to most foreign countries, you ain’t working there unless you have 
a sponsor. It’s not going to happen, because they have very strict laws 
about foreigners coming to their country and working. So you have to have 
people there who sponsor you. It’s a lot of red tape. I’m just so lucky they do 
all the red tape for me. They call me, they put it all together and I just show 
up.
The insurances you mentioned, are they international? I know in the UK it 
costs around 1000£ and covers just the UK?
You’ll have to check, you can ask them. I know the Clowns of the USA only 
do coverage in the continental U.S. and in Canada and Hawaii. Outside of 
that I don’t believe they do that’s why when I worked out of the country, I 
leave all of that to my sponsors, they take care of all that.
Oftentimes, the venues that hire you there will take care of all that, it’s 
written into the contract and is part of the fees that are paid. For example, 
this gig I just did it cost $40,000 just to put it together. That’s before we 
even made a dime, so you can see that sometimes some gigs cost a lot of 
money just to put together.

We’re going to learn how to do it here for next to nothing. We can do it for 
under $500. You don’t need to spend $40,000 unless you want to go 
overseas and have a sponsor and everything else. 
Where do you find the royalty free music?
Online.
Where?
On the Internet. Jus Google royalty free music and there will be a bunch of 
sites that come up there where you can buy whatever you want. Truly, if 
you have a song you like, you may want to write directly to the artist and 
see if you can have rights to it. A lot of artists are very generous and will 
give you the rights to use their music for a small amount.
They don’t care. It gets them out there all the time they just want to be paid 
something. Don’t be shy or afraid to ask somebody, just go on the Internet 
and listen to music. If there’s something out there that floats your boat that 
you think you can use in a routine, contact the artist and say wow, I dig your 
thing, I think I can use this, would that be okay? What would you charge me 
for the rights to your song?
People are very generous, so don’t be afraid to approach somebody. They 
want to help you and they want to get their stuff out there.
MusicBakery.com is a good place to get royalty free music. Have you ever 
used hypnotic music in your presentation and would you recommend 
something like that, because it might take the whole audience into more 
trance?
All you need to do is come to one of my shows and you’ll hear hypnotic 
music created by me. I create my own music. I have fun with it because my 
brain sometimes just does not go to sleep. So some of my best creativity 
comes with a bottle of wine, late at night when I have nothing else to do I’ll 
sit with my trusty Mac and use tons of different programs on there that I 
create music with.
I play with stuff, pull out my guitar and play with something or I’ll get a beat 
in my head and I’ll start putting different loops and tracks and things 
together until it’s like yeah, in the groove, etc. 
So, in regards to insurance again, if you have a therapy business I’ve been 
told if you’re insured by that and they find out you’re doing stage shows 
they’ll drop you. I’ve been told to not tell the insurance company you have 
for your therapy business that you’re doing stage shows. What are your 
thoughts on that?

I think that’s true, there are some insurance companies when you’re doing 
hypnotherapy that don’t want you doing stage work. They have issues. 
They need therapy themselves. They think there’s something wrong with it, 
but that’s my personal opinion about it. Look into it, if they don’t want you to 
and would get rid of your coverage because of that, then you may want to 
find a provider that will cover you on both ends.
Are you still insured with your therapy business or is it all for your stage 
shows?
Mine is all stage stuff. I really don’t do much therapy at all it’s just not where 
I am.
When I work with people it’s the kind of stuff that I would do after a show or 
something, or I do mentoring and stuff like that, but mentoring isn’t therapy. 
When I do coaching it’s not therapy. It’s not what you do it’s what you say 
you do. So for those of you out there saying well, they won’t let me do 
hypnosis in Scotland, then don’t say you’re doing hypnosis, call it something 
else. 
I was in Saudi Arabia a few years ago for a month. There was a guy who 
was doing hypnotizing type of stuff there and got his head cut off for doing 
it. That was a bummer. I heard about it and thought I should be careful and I 
was doing a lecture there one night to a group of people, and there was 
another gentleman there doing a lecture that same week who had a very 
similar type crowd.
He was doing exactly what I do, but he called it ‘science of the mind’. 
Semantics is everything when you’re dealing with some of these items. 
As far as the music goes, generally, you’ll have it on as the people are 
coming in, sitting down and 20 minutes before your show. Is there any point 
in time when you just lose the music obviously, or when you have a moment 
when you freeze and shut the music off? Or, do you have something going 
all the time?
I have something going all the time. I don’t like dead spots, I like something 
always happening because it keeps the mind involved because what 
happens, if you have so much stuff going on and all of a sudden it just 
becomes dead, then it’s like people wake up and go what the hell 
happened?
It’s like a trance breaker, in a way, so for me I always have something going 
in the background, because it sounds professional, it looks good, it’s a great 
segue and what you want is something to come across just like that. Make 
everything flow. It’s like you’re tripping out and watching these waves of 
energy, music and performance happening. 

365
To me it’s like a big orchestra that I see in my mind just happening so I want 
this to continue…that’s how I see it during a performance.
How much do you ask as a beginner stage hypnotist? Do you ask the same 
price for every show or the bigger the audience the more you ask?
As much as you can possibly get. Never short change yourself! If you’re 
doing a show in your hometown, obviously you can do it for a little less than 
if you had to drive for two hours and spend 4 hours on the road, buy gas 
and maybe you’re so tired when you’re done doing a show that you’ll want 
to spend the night.
Listen, when you start doing a show and you really put a lot of energy into it, 
it’s a lot of work and draining. When I get done with a show, because when I 
do a show I put a lot of energy into it, when I’m done I’m spent. It’s done, 
I’m over with. I’m happy to do one show a week and that’s about it. I don’t 
like to do more. 
When I was in Dubai and had to do four, I thought oh my goodness, but 
then I thought okay, I can do it for a little bit. You put a lot of energy into it. 
Years ago they wanted me to come to Vegas to do a show and I had a 
show at the new Frontier. I negotiated that deal for a few months, they had 
the big marquee out there with my name on it for three months and they 
had this big poster of me that was taller then this room.
The negotiations continued between my attorney and theirs, we had a real 
frustrating time. We had ads in all the local papers and magazines, booklets 
plus up and down the strip, on taxi’s and everything, but we had some 
negotiation problems, something I couldn’t overlook.
The night I was supposed to show up for the first show I decided to go fly 
fishing. I stayed away from Vegas for a while. There were some things in 
the contract that I couldn’t live with and they weren’t willing to change them; 
they kept saying… the thing is when you negotiate a contract you have to 
play hardball. If there’s something in a contract that you just can’t live with 
then you just can’t live with it.
To take a contract and have somebody try to control my life saying, if 
there’s anything we don’t like about you, what you say, what you do, how 
you smell, anything about that then we’re going to kick you out within 24 
hours. I said listen dude, I can’t do that. He said we’re not going to do that. I
said then take it out of the contract. 
We worked on this for about three months, rewriting the contract, so he kept 
saying we’re not going to do that. I said then you need to change the 
contract. So the night of the show that was sold out I didn’t show up. I lost 
about $12 million bucks a year, but so be it, I can live with myself. Why work 
under conditions that you can’t live with.

And some things you can negotiate and live with, but sometimes you have 
to make a choice and mine was to go fly fishing.

Thanks. 
When you see somebody like at the Improv or a comedy show, what is the 
normal financial arrangement there? Are they paying a fee to bring the 
hypnotist in or is there a share of the door, etc.?
That’s going to depend upon the venue and upon you as the performer. 
Your reputation will go out in front of you. Obviously, the more experience 
you have, the more you can demand and that’s the way it is. 
When I work in a comedy club, which I won’t do very often, the main reason 
is that they just don’t pay enough. Here’s what happens when you go to a 
comedy club. They’ll usually have one or two opening acts that will get up 
there and banter for 10-15 minutes. Then they have what’s called the 
headliner.
In most places, the opening act will get between $150 and $300. The 
headliner gets whatever they can get $500, $700, $1000, $2000, $5000, 
whatever they can demand, which again comes with your level of 
experience and your ability to BS.
When I started studying hypnotherapy years ago, I had a wise instructor 
who said 
. There’s another one people always ask me, well I’ve never done 
this how am I going to make the money or get these gigs? You know what, 
fake it till you make it. That’s all you have to do.
They don’t know who you are. But you know who you are, and if you walk 
up there with an err of confidence anybody will give you an opportunity. Say 
listen, let me come do a show, it won’t cost you anything. I don’t even want 
you to pay me, just let me come in and do a show. 
You help me promote it and take all the money from the booths and you’ll 
get lots of drinks from that. I’ll just take the door or I’ll split the door with you, 
anything to get inside of a room you can do, but you need to get out there 
and get the experience, whatever it takes, fake it till you make it.
What does, I’ll just take the door mean?
Ticket sales. Listen, most places don’t care about ticket sales because
they’re going to make so much money on the booze, that’s all they care 
about.

Here in Vegas, they don’t care about the showroom. They limit most shows 
to about an hour because they want people out on the floor gambling. All 
you are is a lost leader item. It’s like going to the grocery store, they have 
these lost leader items on the end of the aisles, but the big thing comes 
down the aisle but it’s no big deal.
I know you said you don’t do small venues or small shows like under a few 
hundred people…
I will. As a rule I do not, but I like to and I will because I really enjoy working 
with smaller more intimate crowds; they’re a lot of fun.
...so as a beginner, for people starting out, we can’t expect to have an 
expectation of getting 500 on a first show. What do you think is the 
minimum amount of people that someone should perform with?
Personally, I wouldn’t do a show with under 100 people. I have done it and 
they’ve been some of the most fun I’ve ever done, but I’ve been doing it for 
a long time. If you’re new at this, then I wouldn’t do it for less than 100 
people. The reason for that is the more people you have, the more 
opportunity you have to get good subjects.
The hypnosis show is like this, it’s like a moth being drawn to the flame. 
When you put it out there (hypnosis), you get this somnambulist out there 
who goes yeah…I want to be hypnotized. A somnambulist is a person who 
walks or talks in their sleep, they’re natural trance people.
We wall do that on some level, anyway. So the hypnosis show draws a real 
element of people who are fascinated with the show and the more people 
we have the easier it is to get people who really want to come out and get 
hypnotized and have a good time, so stack it in your favor and have at least 
100 people in there. 
Like I said I’ve done it in smaller venues and have had a fantastic show, so 
you never know. I did this show once and 40 people showed up to it and I 
thought this is stupid I can’t even pay for the venue I’m not going to do this. 
I said listen everybody, thanks for coming out but I’m not going to do it 
because there’s not enough people here. I’m going to give you all your 
money back and even buy you a drink I’m going to take a loss on this.
They go oh, no please stay and do it. I said no, I’m not going to do it. They 
said please we all want to get hypnotized. I said well if you all get 
hypnotized there won’t be anybody out there and they said we don’t care. 
So I said okay and it was one of the funniest nights I’ve ever had. I lost 
money, not as much because I kept all the money since they stayed, but 
that was a long time ago.

I’ve never heard that description of a somnambulist before as someone that 
walks or talks in their sleep. I’ve heard other descriptions for it that were 
more scientific like clinical, but would that be a good question to ask the 
audience, like how many people here talk in their sleep or have sleep 
walked before, as a way to filter out good subjects?
I wouldn’t worry about that. You could do that, but I don’t worry about that. 
My thing is…listen, I’m glad you guys are here who’s ready to have a good 
time…
Woo-woo.
All right, who wants to be hypnotized?
Woo.
Wow, so I guess the rest of you are here to watch those guys get messed 
with right. Okay cool, that’s what it’s all about, because if you’re not going to 
do it we can watch them and you’re still going to have a good time no 
matter what you do. So, those of you who do want to have a good time, 
come on up and let’s party. That’s how I approach it.
Some people get into the technical kind of stuff, but my feelings are is that 
when I’m doing a show that most people aren’t there for education, they’re 
there for entertainment. So what I try to do is give them an entertainment 
value for their dollar. If they want to do education, in the back of the room 
go pick up that flyer because I’ll be doing a seminar in two days, invite all 
your friends for $50 each. All I need is 200 people, have a good night.
That’s part of the backroom sales and I try to keep that to a minimum.
You mentioned earlier that you recorded the Dubai shows and it’s running 
on your website. It makes me wonder, at what point does it become your 
right to record it or the venues right to record it. Can they control what you 
record in any way, how you use it, sell it or display it?
No, it has nothing to do with them. It’s my show. Do you know how much I 
had to pay for that venue? The room alone was $6000 a night, so it’s mine.
So does it depend on whose paid, because had you negotiated the kind of 
deal where the host is paying for everything, would that then be that they 
say the material is ours?
No, you negotiate all that in the contract. In my contracts everything belongs 
to me, everything. Nobody has the right to videotape record it in any way 
without the permission of Sleep Now Productions, Inc. Anybody who does 
that will be sued and will be held liable. 

369
Even at seminars like this we don’t allow anybody else to do recording of 
any kind, because we’re putting a lot of effort into what we’re doing. This is 
our business. It’s a business it’s not just a performance so we have to treat 
it that way. So, anybody kind of performer whether it’s the stage hypnotist or 
Madonna whoever, they own the rights to their performance no matter 
where they go.
A venue may say we want to split that with you and some venues will do 
that. They go listen, anything you do in the back room we want 20% of all 
the sales you do. It’s standard in many of the larger theaters. It is what it is. 
Cool, I’ll split it with you take your 20% that’s fine, no big deal because 
that’s still 28% of something you didn’t have to begin with. That’s how I look 
at it.
Super quick…since I’m brand new and have never done a show before, I 
don’t have a contract. Where could I get a boilerplate that I could at least 
hand to an attorney so he wouldn’t charge me for every single word that he 
ever saw?
I won’t charge you that much.
For yours?
Drop me an email and I’ll send you a copy, no big deal.
Thank you.
If you want a copy of a simple contract that you can use in anything, go to 
my website, drop me an email and I’ll be happy to send you one. 
It’s a little off the technical as far as dollars and cents, but my thought is, 
just a couple of skit ideas between a high school, college and a corporation. 
Let’s hold onto that because we’re going to cover that in the next section. 
Spencer, of course, has done this for a while so he has an idea of what to 
look for in a contract. I’m telling you, you don’t want to get screwed out of a 
couple things so find a local attorney who can help you, but like Spencer 
said he’ll shoot you a contract. It’ll probably be pretty solid, but for anybody 
else you can find them online, just make sure you’re not getting jogged 
because you didn’t look at the certain things that are in there.
Exactly. When you’re out there doing your own thing, every time somebody 
contacts me and wants to do a gig, I fill out a contract and send it to them. 
They sign it, send me a deposit and everything happens. It’s pretty 
straightforward; whenever I book a gig I want 50% down and I want the 
balance paid 30 days before I perform.

Or, if it’s within a 60 day period, I get paid everything in advance before I 
even show up. I have expenses I’ve got to cover and I’m not going to take it 
out of my own pocket for somebody else. Because there’s nothing worse 
then getting to a place and having somebody say they’re going to pay you 
and you don’t get paid. That can happen, so you want to cover your ass at 
all times. 

371
Abreactions
It’s nothing personal it’s just business, it’s not a big deal when somebody 
hires you like that. But what happens if you’re doing a show and somebody 
has some kind of an abreaction and freaks out? I want to cover that for a 
second and then when we come back after lunch I’ll go into it a little more 
in-depth, because we only have about five minutes left and that’s it.
I need somebody who wants to role play with me. Who wants to be messed 
up? All right Edward. Anyway, let’s say I’m doing a show and Edward is 
sitting up on stage as one of the subjects and he’s having some type of 
abreaction and I need to stop whatever I’m doing to work with this guy. It’s 
happened to me before and it can happen to you, it’s just the nature of the 
business of the beast.
And you, the professionally trained analytical and highly competent 
hypnotherapist, besides being a confident, competent stage hypnotist 
professional right, there’s another layer to this…you know how to handle 
anything that comes in front of you, you deal with what emerges. 
So, for example, let’s say something is happening with him and he’s having 
some kind of melt down, he doesn’t know what’s happening and he’s 
freaking out. Can you freak out for me? I may just watch him for a moment 
and let him get filmed.
Dude where am I?
Are you okay?
I don’t like this. Don’t touch me.
Are you all right?
Don’t touch me where am I?
Are you sure?
I don’t know what’s going on.
Hey cool, stop for a second. Look right here.
What?

Take a deep breath in and sleep. Now, what I’m going to do is help a 
person to get out of that completely, very quickly. Sometimes you may want 
to do something like that and it does not work, you don’t know and that’s 
what happens is that you never know what’s going to happen. 
First, what I would do if I’ve got somebody like that I might tell them to sleep 
and say listen, I’m going to count to three, open your eyes and have you 
come off the stage. My assistant is going to help you, she’ll take you back 
stage and talk to you for a little bit.
So my first rule is that I’m going to have my assistant take them off the 
stage and I’m going to go wow, what was that all about? He’ll be back in a 
few moments, but until he gets back let’s go on with the show. I’ll make it 
part of the show first and foremost, because you are the consummate 
performer, the entertainer, so the show must go on.
That said; I’m also not a mean person. I’m a really nice guy and if 
something happens and I have been known to stop a show because 
somebody is having difficulty and I will work with them. Trust me on this, the 
audience is very generous and they think it’s cool that you would take out 
that time to help another human being.
Don’t ever be afraid to stop and help somebody who needs help, because 
you never know what’s going to happen. There may be a time when you 
need help with something and you’ll be glad that somebody stopped to help 
you. 
So anyway, he’s wigging out, going nutty and fruity and stuff like that, so I 
make him sit down and say audience excuse me for just a moment I need 
to help this guy for a second. 
Edward, open your eyes and be nice and calm with me. How are you 
doing buddy? What seems to be going on?
I don’t know where I am.
Okay, good. Close your eyes again. Listen, I’m going to count to 
three, you’re going to open your eyes and wake up all the way 1-2-3, 
all the way awake. How are you doing?
Okay.
Let’s take it to a different dimension. Let’s say the guy is really freaking out 
and having a bad time. I might do a mini session with him. I’ll say close your 
eyes for just a second, you know, you’re shaking a little bit because 
something is going on. 

373
I have a very straight line approach like, what’s going on in your 
body, where do you feel that, what’s happening?
In my shoulders.
In your shoulders okay, go in your shoulders very quickly, go in your 
shoulders, you got that? Go to that feeling; let’s go back very quickly 
to an earlier time when you had that same feeling. Where that takes 
you is it daytime or nighttime? 
Daytime.
Inside or outside?
Inside.
Alone or is somebody with you?
Somebody’s with me.
Good. How old do you seem to be?
Forty.
Right on, good. What’s happening?
I’m in my office.
Okay, let’s do this very quickly. Before we do anything, let’s take that 
information and what’s happening in your office and let’s move 
through it very quickly. I want you to take yourself out of that
moment, just breathe into it and then relax. Let’s move to before that 
moment happened and be nice and calm.
Let’s take that moment that happened there and let’s just take it out 
of your brain for a second. For example, just lift it up and move it 
over to the side so its not even there, can you do that? Now, let’s go 
into your life some time where you had something really cool happen 
to you, got it?
Let’s put that back in that spot so you have something really cool 
happening, got it? Now let’s bring it all together, merge it all together, 
on the count of three open your eyes and bring everything back 
feeling great 1-2-3. Good, how do you feel?
Relaxed.
Good. Is everything good?

That’s one way to approach it on something simple. You may have 
something that’s more intense then that, but hypnotherapy doesn’t have to 
be very difficult or long. I can take a hypnotherapy session and turn it to 
something that only takes a couple minutes to do instead of hours to work 
with.
The nice thing about being a performer is that you learn all these really cool 
techniques that you can get through things very quickly. 
Thanks Edward. 
I’d like to role play this a little, so when we come back from lunch I want to 
talk more about this, because it’s a serious thing that can happen and our 
job is to take care of everyone and make them feel good. We’ll talk about 
doing a mini hypnotherapy session and I’ll show you a couple other 
techniques that will be valuable for you to use. Would you like that?
Yes. Applause
So far have you gotten some good information this morning?
Yes!
After lunch we’ve got a list of things that will have to do with how to book 
shows with everything from cruise lines to theaters and how to work the 
whole gamut of business, so when you are done your day you can go on 
the phone tonight and book a show, right?

The Stage
Let’s find out how to make some money. Who’s here to make money? 
Joe’s making money he just booked a show.
You just booked a show?
He’s going to Italy three days after he gets back.
Italy.
No.
Where is it?
At home in southern California.
What part?
Orange County.
All right, the big OC. What part of Orange County?
Irvine.
I used to go to Irvine Park when I was a little whipper-snapper. I grew up in 
Woodier. It’s not the same as it was back then. Hey Joe, where you going 
with that trance in your hand? How much you getting paid buddy?
Twenty five hundred dollars.
Twenty five hundred dollars, give Joe a round of applause.
Applause
Where did you book it? Stand up Joe, because Joe just booked a show in 
Orange County for $2500 after only two and a half days in the boot camp 
stage hypnosis course here in wonderful Las Vegas, Nevada. Joe, please

It’ll be on a Tuesday, two weeks from now at the UC Irvine Bren Center. It 
seats a few thousand, I’m hoping for at least a few hundred. I’m working with 
some of the students on campus. I have several friends that work there too, 
so I’m getting the venue for free and I’m working on getting as many students 
there as possible.
Applause
Right on, that is going to be fun. If that doesn’t inspire you all nothing will. 
What do you do right now Joe, do you work or are you retired?
Sort of.
Cool. Well, you know what, even if you’re not sort of retired, $2500 for a 
couple hours of work isn’t bad wages is it?
Not bad at all.
That’s awesome! I like to hear stories like that. The cool thing about that too, 
working at the college, you’ll get a lot of gigs. Orange County is a good place 
and they should have somebody doing a full-time show there. The thing that 
Orange County and L.A. County competes with is Las Vegas, because it’s so 
cheap to come to Vegas. 
But they have some venues down there…I was there a few years ago looking 
around and thought…there are some great places here if somebody would 
just build a show there, they could do it weekly and bank, making as much as 
the guys in Vegas or more.
It’s a huge market. You could probably do three or four shows a week in one 
venue, that’s just the way it is there it’s a huge market. You can draw 
everybody from Orange County, from L.A. County, San Diego County, all 
over down there and that’s basically, all of southern California. You’re on your 
way. When I come to your show can I get free passes? Of course…the 
professional stage hypnotist notices all ambiance of people. All nuances are 
there, we keep our eyes open.
I want to digress for a moment. Your stage is like this, you have your stage 
area and you have your two speakers out here going out towards the 
audience and then you have your two monitors going here to the people on 
stage. I wanted to give you a diagram of what that looked like so you’d have 
that clear in your mind, because I know I do a lot of pointing like that and I 
know some people are diagram kind of people, so here is your diagram.

377
Equipment Set Up
Then, on this side I drew you another diagram. I don’t do a lot of artwork 
because I am not an artist. I draw stick people. Here you go, there’s your 
setup. Don’t be messing with me now, I worked hard on this. Can anybody 
tell me what I’ve done here?
Boxes and switches, mind mapping…
There you go. Here you are sitting right here, here’s your sound guy. Here 
you have your table and where they’re using their laptop or whatever medium 
you used, maybe they’re doing spinning discs, however they have that set up. 
This is so, for example, if you’re working in a nightclub, the Elks Lodge or 
something, you’re new at this and you’re not real comfortable with your 
person being way back in the back of the room, maybe you have them sitting 
over here at a table and they’re set up that way.
Then, if during the show you need to walk over there, make it part of the 
show and check it out. You come back and the audience doesn’t notice it too 
much but you can play that as part of the show. So anyway, from your laptop 
to run the sound, the sound goes out to this thing called a mixing board. You 
can get a mixing board at Radio Shack, they come in all sizes and shapes 
right now and for what your needs are you probably won’t need one with 
more than four channels on it.
It’ll run you around $400 to $700 and will do the job for you perfectly. You’ll 
need a mixing board if you’re running your own sound, and I recommend that 
at some point you get your own equipment. It’s so much cooler to have your 
own equipment then to use somebody else’s. I don’t know how many times 
I’ve walked into a venue and thought, what have I done? 
Now from the mixer where you mix all your sound in here and have all these
little buttons and stuff. It looks really cool with little things that slide up and 
down. Then from the mixer you have wires that go down here into this little 
thing here called an amplifier, which is a little gadget that powers the 
speakers. You cannot power the speakers without it.
So for your sound, you have your main line coming from your laptop that 
goes into a little control knob, that’s the mixer. If you don’t know what a mixer 
is look in the back. If you see the machine with all the knobs on the far end of 
the table, that’s it.
Well basically, they go down to an amp and from the amp you have wires that 
go out to power the speakers. You can see the lines hanging from the 
speakers here and that’s how your basic setup is, that goes out to your side

ones on the stage and then her are the two monitors that are coming back 
onto your stage.
That’s your basic setup for as far as sound goes. When you get to larger 
theaters, like if you’re working at a college that has sound or if you go to a 
high school with a nice auditorium that has a cool stage, which a lot of them 
have now that are very elegant with a good sound room.
All you do is patch into their system. That just means…I take my laptop and 
plug right into their mixer. It’s very simple to do. Does that make sense?
What’s your monitor?
A monitor is, basically, a speaker that’s sitting in front of you pointing towards 
the subjects on stage. It’s just something that you, as a performer, can hear 
yourself talking and that the people up on stage can hear you. Otherwise, if 
the speakers are just going outwards, the sound is oftentimes muffled and the 
people on stage don’t get a clear audio of what you’re saying.
Does everybody understand that?
I just want you to understand the elements of that if you’re doing your own 
show, so that if you want to go that route you can buy your own equipment. If 
you buy your own equipment you’re probably going to spend…for the mixer 
probably $300, amplifier you’ll pay around $800, for good speakers at least 
15” and you’re saying you like the self powered ones –I don’t like them. They 
may be good now they’ve changed but I haven’t really looked at them– I use 
self power and use the amplifier. For good speakers you’ll pay around $700 
to $1500 each.
I have some in my garage in Kalispell if anyone wants to come buy them, 
because I no longer use them. For the smaller monitors you’ll spend $500 to 
$1000 on them.
What size are the monitors?
The monitors are about the same size, like 15”. They can be a bit smaller but 
I like to have at least 15” and these can be 17”, depending on the size of the 
room. Down on the floor here you’ll see what they call sub-woofers, which 
gives it base and tonality. Without those down there the speakers up here 
would sound a bit higher pitched, so that gives it more base and soul.
At the theater I had I took the big sub-woofers and put them under the stage, 
so when I had my music playing the people on stage would feel it because 
the base would be humping through the floor. I did it on purpose.
When we watched you in Las Vegas you had that video thing going on before 
you came out, how did you make that? Did you just do that on your Mac with 
Student:

the eyes looking the wrong ways and all that crazy hypno stuff, all the stuff in 
your head that nobody really wants to know about?
That’s true. Yes, I made that on the Mac.
Thanks.
And with different software programs, I just threw it all together.
What he’s referring to, if you weren’t in Vegas, at the show we had a big 
screen on the side and I projected a preshow video on the screen to entertain 
the audience before the show began. I do that because it’s a lot of fun and 
sometimes I’ll put clips of my shows on the monitor so people get an idea of 
what I’m going to do.
They’ll think, so that’s what he’s going to do to us huh, wow! It excites the 
imagination at the same time. So, if you want to use a big screen behind you 
with a projector, create some type of video montage or whatever, you can do 
that. I’ve got four or five different video montages. A lot of them are various 
clips from my shows over the years with me standing on people, etc.

The Human Bridge
I want to talk about that for a second before we move forward. How many of 
you want to know about standing on top of a person, the human bridge? I’ve 
been instructed not to show you but to tell you how it works. I’ve seen too 
many hypnotists do this and have seen too many people hurt, so if you’re 
going to do this then you better damn well get it right. I’ll show you how to do 
it right, so no one gets hurt. Because you can hurt somebody with the human 
bridge, so you have to be very careful.
When I was in Salt Lake I did that every week. It was like the finale of my 
show and it looked very cool. Where’s the guy that’s been to my show? I’m 
interested, stand up and take a mic. I’d like to hear about this. He was telling 
me the other day that he used to go to my show in Salt Lake City, the one I 
did at the Avalon Theater for 6 ½ years, so I was intrigued about this story 
and I haven’t heard it yet. Just take a moment and share with everyone and 
me too...
It all depends, like the routines you were doing?
No, I mean the show. What was it like to go to the show that I did at the 
Avalon?
It was pretty magical like. 
Laughter
When you went, what was the experience? Was there a lot of people there? 
How many times did you go?
I’ve been quite a few times. It’s been about 12-13 years ago.
Wow! Has it been that long?
I’m 25, so that was a while ago. 
I’m 35…
The routines, some of them I can remember pretty well, like you were having 
people drive the car and you caught a speed bump.
Let me ask you this. When you walked into the theater and the show began, 
what was it like at the beginning of the show, do you remember that?
It was like a magic show almost, except it was hypnotic. (thank you)

Okay well, you enjoyed the show though didn’t you, let’s just go with that?
Yeah. In fact, it drove a lot of the people I knew over there. My neighbor was 
a weekly…
I have a question, because something is coming to my brain right now and if 
I’m not mistaken, did you come up on stage before?
Yes.
I’m starting to remember something. Did you come up there and you thought 
you were Elvis Presley?
Yes sir. I had the name tag and everything. 
I remember that. At one point I remember I told you to stay off the stage didn’t 
I?
I don’t remember that.
I do remember that. 
Laughter
I don’t mean that in a bad way, but I did a show there every week and I would 
get hundreds of people that would come to the show and people would want 
to come up all the time to get hypnotized over and over again, but I always 
wanted to get some new people. I remember you came up and I had this 
Elvis thing going on and you came up a lot. I remember now.
That’s me.
Tell them, what was it like when I always stood on top of somebody?
You were really fragile when you did it, very cautious. You would stand up on 
the chair, of course, you had those metal folding chairs right?
No, I had some nice beautiful supports on the side.
I mean the chairs where people sat. 
Yes, those were metal. I had everybody sitting on the stage.
Then you had the black and yellow sawhorses.
Come up here.

That’s good enough for now, I just wanted to get your feedback, but you went 
to the show numerous times, you took a lot of people there and had a great 
time right?
Yes. 
You got your bang for the buck. 
Yes, I mean it was like $3-$4 a night?
Hell no man, it was $6 back then and I finally got the got at the theater to 
raise it to $8. I said no, I want to charge $10 and then I wanted him to raise it 
to $12 and he said no. I said bye.
He was a negotiable guy.
I left at that time and took my show to another venue after 6 ½ years I got 
tired of him. No big deal. It was time to move up and make more money but 
he didn’t want to, so I did. 
With this human bridge, when you have subjects up there and you’re doing 
your show. I’m always looking to keep in my mind who I’m going to use for 
that routine. I notice people and decide who’s a good subject. I always pick 
the smallest person on stage. 
Let’s say for example, you’re sitting in a chair hypnotized and so I simply go, 
how would you like to be the most powerful person in this room tonight? 
Sure.
Awesome! Have you ever had a back or neck problem?
No.
Perfect. I want to cover myself on tape. I record every one of my 
presentations. Have you ever had a neck or back problem? If she says yes, 
then I’m going to go okay cool and then I’ll pick somebody else, because 
when you do the human bridge somebody can get hurt because you’re 
making their body stiff and rigid as a steel bar and you’re going to put them 
across two supports and then stand on top of them.
It’s really pretty cool. So, for example, I don’t have the kind of supports I want 
but I’m going to give you an idea of what I would do. I’ll get another volunteer 
up here to help me and to show you how to perform this without performing it. 
I just want to give you the mechanics of it, so if you decide you want to go off 
and do it at some point you’re on your own.

383
Let’s say we’re going to use two chairs like this, for example. Then I’ll have 
another assistant, I need a strong guy. 
I have a judo black belt.
Okay, but are you strong?
What do you want me to do?
When I do this, I’m not going to demonstrate this, but I want to show you the 
mechanics. When I do this I always have an assistant who’s going to help me 
lift the person and put them between two supports. We’re not going to do 
anything I just need you to stand there. With a human bridge what I’m going 
to do is take this individual and the way I approach it. 
Look right here, take a deep breath and make your body stiff and rigid. 
Make everything stiff and rigid and powerful. Put your arms behind your 
back and lock your fingers just like that. Make every muscle stiff and 
rigid. Close your eyes, stand and sleep. Make everything stiff and rigid 
and powerful. I’m going to go down here and make sure everything is 
stiff, rigid and powerful, because I want their body to be stiff and rigid.
Put your head back please. Make everything stiff and rigid and powerful.
Now, I’ve got this person like this and their body is stiff and rigid. I put their 
hands back to make sure everything is nice, stiff and rigid. 
I’m going to do this, I’m going to say open your eyes and relax 
everything, good take another deep breath. When I said sleep make 
your body stiff and rigid. Stiff and rigid and powerful. Stiff and rigid and 
powerful and I’m going to go through this…stiff and rigid and powerful…
I’m going to go through it two or three times, because I want their body to be 
stiff and rigid. I want to make sure they are in total compliance of what I have 
to say. 
Bring your feet together. Your body is stiff and rigid and powerful. 
At this point, when I’m sure they’re where I want them to be, I simply say…
In a moment I’m going to bring you backwards and I do it while your 
body remains stiff and rigid and powerful at all times. Stiff and rigid and 
powerful.
When I do that I’m going to bring her back. You’ll lift up her feet…stiff and 
rigid and powerful, lift them up. You can see the rigidity of the body. Put her 
down now. Standing up. Relax. At this point, I’m not going to do this but, what 
Student:
Spencer:
Student:

384
you want to do when you have the supports is to put the body with the legs 
right here, this part on the calves over one part of the support. So if we have 
it like this, the calves would be here and the mistake I see some hypnotists 
make is they will take a person and put their foot on there and put their head 
on the other part.
I’ve seen a hypnotist do that and then they go to stand on somebody and 
they collapse. You can hurt somebody really bad. I always put a support 
between here and right here across the broad of the back. Then on the 
supports I use I have them nicely padded so the person doesn’t get hurt, 
because when I stand on them I stand on them all the way.
For example, if she’s there and you can hallucinate this, then finally I stand 
on top of her and I put one foot when she’s there right here. Then I place the 
other foot right smack in her gut. Then it’s like boom.
That would be impressive.
It is. If you want to see a demonstration, go to YouTube or my website. 
Why are you always worried you’re going to hurt someone, especially if it’s in 
a venue where its strangers coming up?
No, I am not ever. That’s why I always ask the questions. If I feel like 
somebody could get hurt I will not do it it’s that simple. I’ve done shows where 
I can’t find a small gal, so I’ll find the smallest guy I can find. Now, keep in 
mind, if you’re like a 250 pound hunk of man and you want to stand on a little 
lady like this, I would think twice and be very careful.
If I was considering doing this routine, I would take a man like him and a lady 
like her and then have him stand on top of her.
Very good. You can do that but you would want to manage every aspect of it, 
right. For example, when I’m doing this, and you know if you have a stage like 
this perhaps you could have two stands right there. Let’s say this is a person 
and you have them down there lower, you can walk right off the stage and on 
top of somebody just like that, if you have the two supports on the floor.
If you’re back here and you have somebody up here that’s high, then of 
course, you’ll have something back here that you can stand on. You’ll have 
the assistant come over here and help you stand on top of the person. They 
guide you so you don’t fall off. While I’m up there I have them release my 
hand and do my thing for however long I want to stand there for the audience 
to get the wow factor.
Then I take their hand and get down and I’ll simply sit down, cluck her down 
in my lap and rock her to sleep. Wake her up and everybody’s happy. Then, 
Student:
Spencer:

when I’m done with that I take the lady and say, do you realize that you just 
had me standing on top of you?
No.
Do me a favor folks, give her a powerful round of applause while she takes a 
bow and make her feel good.
Applause
Then I go further then that and say you know what, you have an 
incredibly powerful mind. Everything you ever wanted to achieve in your 
life you can achieve because of what you can achieve right now, so I 
want you to take this feeling in this moment with you into the rest of your 
life. Give her another powerful round of applause and make her feel 
good.
Applause
I hope that settles your curiosity about that. They are good for various 
reasons, which I’m not going to demonstrate here.
I was just curious, if you found an insurance company that will actually let you 
do that, because I’ve looked around and a lot of insurance companies make 
you go through a safety course and they say don’t do that or you’re not 
insured.
I’ve never had an insurance company say one thing to me. Maybe I haven’t 
asked the right questions. Maybe they haven’t sent me the right forms, 
because I haven’t seen that yet, Michael. Is that something you’ve run into?
Well, when you go out looking for insurance and stuff, there are a lot of 
disclaimers. Now they have you take a course here in Las Vegas or from 
some other person on stage hypnosis safety before you can even get your 
insurance.
I see they changed it because they had a big fight. What’s he’s talking about 
is that last year they had a big fight in the industry about insurance for the 
stage hypnotist and all these different conflicting people…to me it was one of 
those political things inside the industry which I don’t like at all. I don’t like 
politics in the industry. I’m not a political guy. 
I like to say here it is its free, take it, use it, if you don’t want it then discard it. 
I don’t like the politics where one segment says you can only do this or only 
do that, that doesn’t set well with me. Being a free spirited person I like to do 
whatever I want.

Promote Yourself
Let’s talk now about your promo pack. You’re a stage hypnotist. You’ve been 
hypnotizing people. You’re good at what you do. You’re feeling good right?
Yes!
You’re ready to go out and make some money now right?
Yes!
But you don’t have all the things you need in order to put it together correctly, 
for most things, except for Joe over there. He’s my hustler. You can all do 
that.
Let me tell you, when you go out and begin to promote yourself, there are 
some things that most venues are going to want, they’re going to want to see 
this thing, especially if you’re going to colleges or high schools and 
universities. If you want to get on the circuit of county, state or city fairs, 
anything, people want to know who you are. 
It’s like who are you? It’s like who are you to come to me to do a show, I 
mean, what are your credentials? This is what people want. I’m going to write 
down some ideas on how to do promotions. 
1. First, they’re going to want a video or a DVD. They want to see you in 
action. They want to see what you have.
Who’s getting a demo from Las Vegas tomorrow?
Woo-hoo! 
Do you think that’s going to be impressive to somebody?
Yes!
That’s why we’re here in Las Vegas. Because you can take this demo and 
say here’s a demo of a show I just did recently at the Venetian Hotel in Las 
Vegas, Nevada. Are you lying?
No!
No. You have been busting your butt the last few days and you have another 
afternoon of busting your butt, and all day tomorrow you’ll be doing more 
stage hypnosis, so you have some experience. In fact, I can tell you this for 
Students:

certain, I’ve been in this business for over 25 years and I’ve trained a lot of 
people. This is one of the most intensive classes I’ve ever participated in for 
stage hypnosis where you are getting more then 99.9% of anybody out there 
whose taking any other type of course, trust me. Your DVD has to look good. 
2. Before you have your DVD you have to have your persona, who are 
you? 
Hallucinate right now the possibility. On your piece of paper in front of you, 
write down who you are. Who do you want to be known as? The booty priest. 
The world’s fastest hypnotist. Who do you want to be? The amazing you. The 
world’s sexiest spy. Who do you want to be? The world’s shortest hypnotist. 
The world’s tallest hypnotist. The funniest guy or the funniest hypnotist ever. 
The Jewish hypnotist. The Muslim hypnotist. 
It doesn’t matter who you are. A clean comedy hypnotist. The dirty hypnotist. 
What do you want to be? Hallucinate, write it down. Start mind mapping it and 
create some possibilities for yourself.
Let me ask you. How many people in here have already thought of some kind 
of title for themselves? Cool. I’m not going to ask you what that is, but I’m 
going to ask you to go as quickly as you can to the world wide web and make 
sure there’s not a domain with that name and register it now before 
somebody else in the room does, because somebody else in here may get 
really mad at you. The first one there wins. That’s just how it is.
If you’d like to share what you think your name is I’d like to hear it. Does 
anybody have a name they’d like to share? You do, is it Elvis? Okay, never 
mind. So, go to the Internet and get yourself a domain name. 
Now, if you’re not familiar with that process, find somebody who can help you 
with that. If you have the skills do it yourself, just do it. You want a presence 
on the Internet. People will go I’ve never done this before, what do I put on 
there? How do I promote myself? 
I’ve got this name, I’m the Las Vegas tomorrow hypnotist, tomorrow’s Las 
Vegas hypnotist, fake it till you make it. The DVD, how do you get the video? 
You have the video clips from tomorrow, so that’s the easy part. If you have 
Mark to do the editing to put the extra titles and stuff on there to doll it up, 
spend the extra money to do it. 
Don’t just get the pictures yourself and think you can do it yourself, unless 
you have editing experience and software to do it. Don’t short change 
yourself have him do that for you that’s what he does. Have him help you out 
with that part. 
Then, you take that DVD and make a bunch of copies of it. Make 100-200 
copies, that’ll be your calling card. You’ll go to a club and say hey, I’m Joe the 

388
hypnotist. I’m wondering if I can do a job here. I’m looking for a place to bring 
my show and he’ll go well, do you have a DVD, a video of yourself? You can 
say yeah, as a matter of fact I do, here it is. So now you have your DVD, your 
promo is done.
You’ve got your name that you need to have so you can give it to Mark, so 
when he edits it and puts your name on there that’s done, because you want 
that on there and you want your contact information on that DVD as well. So 
you want to have your website put together. That’s a must in today’s society. 
If you don’t have it you’re going to die, trust me on this, because somebody 
else is going to have it.
There are 100 other hypnotists out there just like you right now that want your 
job. This is one reason I quit going to county fairs. I did them for a while and 
then I was at this convention, here in Las Vegas. They have it every year, the 
International Association of Fairs and Expos (IAFE), where if you want to 
work at state and county fairs, you have to go there. 
It’s where all the entertainers come to sell themselves and get bought. You 
rent a little booth, set it up, you look cute and you stand there for three days. 
By the end of the three days you’re really tired, unless you have somebody 
doing it for you but you want to be there because you’re selling yourself, 
because you are the product.
The fair market is a tough market to get in, because there are a lot of people 
out there who are new and the fairs don’t have a large budget, so oftentimes, 
what they do is undercut you. I just say fine undercut me. It’s not going to 
work I’m not going to do that. If you’re not going to pay me at least $2500 a 
day for six days straight I’m not going to do it. Plus paying for my plane and 
hotel fees, plus buying my food.
Not when they have somebody else who’s going to come in there and say 
well, gee I’ll do it for $300 a day. Forget about it. For me anyway, but if you 
want the experience of going on the circuit, by all means, please do it. I’m not 
saying don’t do it. I’m saying there are pitfalls in there and there are also 
reasons to do it to get the experience, because then you’re on a tour and you 
get to go do all these different fairs.
You’ll have a lot of stiff competition out there. A lot of people who have been 
doing it for years that go to the same markets year after year. My biggest 
encouragement would be, in your own hometown or county, find a place 
there to lock into and really work on honing your skills, get it down tight. 
That’s what all comedians and performers do.
Do you think Jay Leno just gets up on stage and starts yapping away? 
Seinfeld, no, they go to these little dive comedy clubs and they get out there 
and they try out new material to see how it works on an audience. If it works 

389
they use it, but if it doesn’t work they go I guess it didn’t work too well, so I’m 
not going to use that.
I do the same thing. If there’s something new I’m working on I’ll try that first. 
I’ll go to a market where people have no idea who I am. I’ll pick a little town in 
nowhere USA. I’ll develop a show and I’ll try out some new material to see 
how it works. If it works, great, then I can build on it. If it sinks then I’ll change 
it. So that’s a good way for you to hone your skills is to find someplace and 
do it.
3. Now, talking about the world wide web, you can also get on the 
comedy circuit where you’ll be dealing with a lot of sleazebag hotels, 
which is fun for a lot of people if you like the road. 
It’s a fun way to learn because you get to sleep in one-star motels. We just 
dropped from hotels to motels and you get to eat road food because they will 
feed you, which is greasy, non-nutritional foods, a step up from road kill and 
sometimes it is road kill.
But you have a lot of fun stories that you can eventually tell to people on the 
road. If I had more time I could tell you hundreds of road horror stories that 
I’ve had over the years. 
I’m going to digress and go back to the promo pack. So you have the DVD, 
your name, the World Wide Web you want that, all this goes on your DVD 
and in today’s market that’s all you need is a website because everybody has 
a computer. Just plug them into that.
4. Besides the World Wide Web, use social media to promote yourself.
If you want to be big use social media networks like Facebook, MySpace, 
Ning (you can create your own page there), Twitter, LinkedIn, Plaxo, Stumble 
Upon, there are all sorts of social media. When you have your DVD done, go 
to YouTube and put your promo there. It costs you nothing and then all of a 
sudden people all over the world will see you. Now you have international 
exposure because you’re on YouTube.
The Internet has changed the way we do business and I find myself having to 
constantly move and shift in proportion to what the world is giving us as far as 
promotions. 
5. Business cards, you can have business cards
I don’t use business cards anymore. People ask me for them but I don’t carry 
them. Maybe I should but I don’t, but have them. They don’t cost that much to 
produce and if you’re out here, like in Vegas, you can take a DVD and a 
business card to every hotel in town and give them to the entertainment 
director in each hotel. They’ll put them in a stock of 500 others of people just 
like you doing the same thing.

390
It’s not what you know it’s who you know in this business, trust me.
It’s not how good you are it’s who you know. You can be the best hypnotist in 
the world but if you don’t get out there and network to meet people you’re not 
going to get anywhere and so much of this profession is networking-
networking-networking, meeting people and being a social butterfly for a 
while, you just have to do it.
I don’t have to do it as much as I used to, but when I first started I busted my 
ass doing this. So, I’m letting you know that I busted my ass doing this for 
years, being out there and meeting people, which is what got me around the 
world numerous times. That’s what got me to Playboy and six or seven other 
countries, where you can command fees that pay you $10,000 to $40,000 a 
gig and then you have international exposure.
So you have to pay the price and you’ll get there if you want it bad enough. If 
you’re hungry enough you’ll get there. Who’s hungry in here?
Whoa!
All right. Be that hungry and I promise you will get there.
Before we move forward let’s take your questions now. 
How many languages can you do your show in?
English. Habla Espanol un poquito…enough to get me in trouble.
So you never do translations?
If I’m in a foreign country and people don’t understand me I just use a 
translator.
The direct ones, the one that when you say when they’re here…
Yes, I’ll say something and then I’ll have somebody next to me who repeats it 
in that language, that’s not a problem for me. Why not use a translator? I 
don’t care as long as I’m getting paid.
Do you have any experience using agents or booking companies and do you 
have any thoughts or advice on that?
Yes. We’ll get to that shortly.
It’s about uploading video. If you go to a place called Tube Mogul, it has all 
the major video sites on it, so you can simply plug in your video and then it’ll 
upload to all the major sites and will then get tracking on how many hits you 
get from each site.

Cool.
I strongly advise you, if you’re going into social media, if you don’t know your 
way about to get someone that does. It can be a bit expensive, but it’s well 
worth it, because you can get huge doing that.
Do you need to have releases from the people who are in your shows if
you’re going to put them out, broadcast them, like on YouTube and your 
website?
Yes, you should get releases. Good question.
How do you do that? 
I ask them for them. No, I tell them before the show that this is going to be 
videotaped and have them sign a release form that releases me of any 
liability and says they agree to be videotaped, be on any medium and that 
they release all rights to me.
That’s everyone who comes in the door?
Everyone that comes up on my stage that I use for a video. 
He asked, just the people on the stage right?
Listen, I tell people before the show begins, I say listen this is being 
videotaped. If you do not want to be videotaped do not come up on my stage, 
because I will sell this videotape. Again, if you do not want to be on my stage 
and videotaped, do not come up on stage. If you come up on my stage then 
you’re giving me permission to be videotaped and I say that as I’m being 
videotaped, so when they come up my ass is covered.
Let’s move on. The other thing with promotions is this.
6. Newspaper articles
Whenever you go to do a show you want to send out a press release to every 
newspaper and radio station in town. You want to send a press release to 
every television station in town. You want to send a press release to every 
Internet development company in the area to let them know that you are 
going to be in town. You want to let them know who you are, what your show 
is about, what you’ll be doing in your show and how to contact you for 
interviews.
If you want free publicity then you need to contact all the media. Ninety 
percent of the time you will be turned down. If you are persistent you will be 
on the phone, in the studio, in front of somebody or on TV giving an interview. 

392
It’s the coolest thing ever. Once you’re on TV, you are the local celebrity. 
Once you’re on the radio, everybody hears you. 
When I was in Dubai, I don’t know how they heard about the show, but all of 
a sudden Virgin Radio picked up on it and we didn’t have to pay them a dime, 
but they asked me to come to their studio and they did a 45 minute interview. 
Their listenership was 500,000 people in the Gulf region. The highest 
listenership of any radio station and it cost me nothing.
Do you know how much it would cost you to buy 45 minutes of time on radio 
during drive time? 
Twenty thousand a month.
More money than you make in a year for most people, I think. It’s very 
expensive and it was free. Same thing happened with another radio station. 
They did the same thing and gave me a 30 minute spot, just because they 
were fascinated with hypnosis and they thought it was great that I was the 
world’s fastest hypnotist and from America. Plus, I had a very good manager 
who was busting doors down to get me in.
He’s always out there beating on the doors that’s his job, is to promote me 
and brand me in the Middle East. If you get somebody like that and make it a 
partnership, you can go a long ways. Just know who you are and what your 
limitations are, then develop a group to work with and share the bounty with 
everyone.
Let’s say you do radio and TV shows, you’ve sent press releases, you follow 
up with phone calls and send emails. Maybe you talk to people, keep 
knocking on doors, keep sending emails and get on the phone to talk with 
these people. That’s how you get on the radio and TV or in the newspaper.
7. How about doing some lecture demos free? 
If you want to get major exposure out there, write to the paper. Send them 
something that says listen, free demonstrations with free lecture on hypnosis. 
The public is invited at no charge, 1 hour free lecture. You’d be amazed at 
how many people will show up. 
I used to do stop smoking weight loss seminars and charge people $60-$70 
apiece. I got maybe 50 to 100 people in there so I said forget about it it’s free. 
Stop smoking no charge. All of a sudden I doubled and tripled the number of 
people coming to the seminars. Fine, I’d just sell in the back of the room my 
programs to stop smoking and lose weight and made more money that way 
then I did by charging them to come to the seminar.
Then, if you were doing a show, that’s a bonus because when you’re in a 
town doing a show, the next night you’re ready to do a stop smoking/ weight

loss seminar or stress management seminar. Do you know how many people 
will come to it? Most of them. 
So if you’re doing a show and you have 200 people there, they’ll go out and 
tell people wow! I saw that hypnotist he was fantastic and by the way, 
tomorrow he’s going to conduct a weight loss/stop smoking and stress 
management seminar; let’s go. They’re going to go out there and bring 
people back. It won’t cost you anything. You could probably pick up an extra 
$5000 to $10,000 doing that. 
That’s why I live in Montana. I’ll go there and do a show and then I’ll go 
fishing for two or three weeks. That’s why I do this, so I can go fishing. I like 
to fish and mountain bike. 
How do you contact agents and deal with them? What has your experience 
been, in terms of their ability to help?
It depends on the agent. Most agents aren’t going to deal with you unless you 
can produce extraordinary amounts of money for them. If you can fill a room 
with 1000 to 2000 people six nights a week, they’ll go I’m interested in you, 
because that’s more money in their pocket. There are a lot of sites out there 
where they have different people promoting hypnotists, magicians and things 
like that. 
If you want to get on a site, there are some sites like All Time Favorites, Gig 
Masters, Super Solid Something, but there are different sites where you can 
put your information or DVD about you the stage hypnotist. It will cost but 
people use it. Party Pop is another one, but you’ll get some gigs from them 
and you’ll also be on there with about 300 to 500 other hypnotists competing 
for the same person who’s looking for you.
The competition is stiff but…how many people in here golf raise your hands? 
You true blue golfers, when you go out and golf who do you play against? 
Yourself. This is no different. You’re not in competition with any other 
hypnotists. Listen to this, there’s more of enough of everything for everybody. 
If you want to attract shows attract abundance and you attract abundance by 
knowing there’s more than enough of everything for everybody.
If you get into the spirit of competition with other people, then you’re going to 
be competing with everybody. All you have to do is go out there and be the 
best you can be for yourself and the Universe will go; what an awesome 
person you are. You are there to support everybody, so support everybody 
and you’ll be supported yourself. If you do that you’ll have a massive amount 
of business coming to you at all times. 
Caveat…you have to get out there and bust your butt right. You still have to 
work. You still have to get out there and get the experience. You have to 
knock on doors. Working with agents can be tricky, because a lot of agents 
Student:
Spencer:

394
don’t take people like us in this business, so most people in this business 
become their own agents. You promote yourself and you may find somebody 
that you work with that does promotions for you.
I have a guy now and that’s what he does, he just does promotions for me, 
which is cool I don’t have to deal with it and I don’t really want to I hate it. I 
don’t like the business part of it. I need to know the business part of it but at 
some point I said okay, if he goes out there and gets me a show for $10,000 
a night and he gets $2000 or $3000 grand of that that’s $7000 grand I didn’t 
have to begin with, why not?
There’s more than enough of everything for everybody, right?
Right.
So keep that in mind. When you’re working with agents, they’ll take anywhere 
between 10 and 30% of your chunk at the door.
When I first started with this I worked with different agents in Salt Lake City 
and they actually got me a lot of work. They would charge me 20%. No big 
deal, because they got me into a lot of nightclubs and got me a lot of work 
because they were the entertainment bureau, so they worked with a lot of 
different entertainers.
I happened to be very good at what I did, so they got me a lot of gigs. There 
were some other hypnotists running around town at that time and by the time 
I got done with the town I was the last man standing, because I worked very 
hard at what I did. I wasn’t trying to get rid of anybody, just go out and do 
your thing. Be your genuine, authentic self and be good at it.
There’s not much more you can say about working with agents. When you go 
into venue you can do door splits also, for example, you go into a club and 
they don’t have the $1500 or $2000 to pay you for a show because they’re 
used to paying a band $500 to $700 a night for 5 guys and who are you, just 
one person and you want $2000. They laugh at you, for what? These guys 
are going to play all night, you’re only going to be on for an hour, that’s 
insane and they don’t like that.
So you can do a door split. We’ll charge $15 at the door, you keep half and I 
take half, how’s that for an hour? That’s not a bad deal for either of you. It 
gets you in the door and gets you a lot of work. This is a good way to get 
yourself in the door. Say I’ll do nothing man, just give me the door and you 
keep all the booze. If you start trying to get the booze from them, getting a 
percentage of that then they’ll get queasy on you. 
So, you’re for-walling, you buy the venue, pay for all the promotion, you take 
all the risk and you take whatever you get at the door. By the end of the night 
you hope you broke even. Sometimes you can do very well. I for-wall all the 
time now and I wouldn’t do it unless I was making money.

Where To Get Hired
How do you get booked at county fairs? 
I talked about that earlier. If you want to get booked at a county fair, go to the 
IAFE, because that’s the only way they’re going to hire you. You may be able 
to talk to your local fair board director and sell yourself, but they usually have, 
because the fairs come up through June, July, August and September in the 
states. But here it is March, they’ve already gone in November and have 
booked their acts, so most of the county fairs are already done and over with 
for this year. So come this November, if you want part of the action you need 
to go to the expo.
Colleges also have one called NACA. In order to get on the college circuit, 
most of the time–and a lot of times I can call and talk to different fraternities 
and get in there with them they’ll hire you–if you want to get on the college 
circuit you need to go to this NACA. They hold it every year and you have to 
showcase your show in front of a group of people. They will choose who they 
feel is the best suited person to put on the tour for all the colleges around the 
country.
Myself, I call the different universities that I want to work at and talk to a 
different fraternity or organization there. I’ll say listen, I’m a hypnotist. How 
would you like to make some money? They’ll want to make money for their 
organization, so you work out a deal with them. It’s very simple to do, and 
then you don’t have to go to the NACA.
High schools– take your promo pack, send it to the principal. After you send it 
to the principal you call them up on the phone. Hello Mr. Principal, this is Joe 
the hypnotist did you get that promo pack I sent you? Yes, I did. Awesome! 
What did you think about that? It sucks I’m not interested. Okay, great do you 
know anybody who would be? Or, I don’t know I haven’t had time to look at it. 
Well, I’ll tell you what, when you have a moment to look at it is it okay if I give 
you a call back?
My website is on there and we have lots of additional information on there. 
High schools are no different you simply approach the principal at the high 
schools. Then, every high school has a grad night. Hypnotists are the favorite 
at grad nights across this country. High schools love the hypnotist on grad 
night. 
Grad night is when they lock all the kids in for the night and they have 
entertainers come in and do things. Hypnotists are a favorite there. They 
don’t have big budgets, but if you do 20 grad nights in a month and you 

397
charge them only $1000, that’s not a bad month right? That’s not a bad way 
to go.
A lot of people like to specialize in different markets and that’s how you 
approach them.
There again, whatever state you live in, go to different cities and to their high 
schools or send them all a promo kit and an email. Call them up and ask who 
you need to talk to. You have to do the footwork. You have to knock on doors 
to make anything happen. You have to go out there and do it. You have the 
skills, now you have to go do the business. This is show business. 
Here’s what frustrates me sometimes. People look at what I do and they go 
well geez, who do you think you are, you go out there and make $10,000 a 
night to do a show, $20,000 on this thing and $5000 grand on that. It’s like 
they get an attitude with me and you know what, I’ve spent 25 years busting 
my ass to do this. You don’t know what goes on behind the scenes. For every 
one hour show that I do it probably takes me five to six hours of preparation 
before and after, so it’s not just about going out there and doing the one hour 
show.
You’ve spent hours developing this show by doing your work with the DVDs 
and your promo’s, updating your website and talking to the media, whoever.
You have done a lot of work beforehand to make sure your show comes off 
without a hitch, that you make money, they get entertained and that you 
follow up with whoever wants to talk with you afterwards.
So never feel bad for charging people a lot of money for what you do, 
because you’re worth it. You’ve put in the work. In just these four days you 
guys are busting your balls, right guys.

Q&A Session
I’ll take questions right now and then we’ll go on with more of the business.
Just on the concept of for-walling you call it, that’s where you say I’m going to 
rent out this hall and I’m going to keep some of the money of the tickets and 
the venue gets the other half or whatever percentage you’re giving them or 
do you keep all the money?
All the money. You also have all the risk.
So with that you’re going to advertise yourself beforehand, because you said 
before, never be like a sideshow, you always want to be the destination. So 
you’re going to make sure you advertise yourself before that?
That’s right. 
You do that and sell your own tickets. For example, when I do a show like 
that I do all my own ticketing. I use PayPal. It’s simple and easy, I’ve used it 
for years it’s a piece of cake. When I go to do a show and do a for-wall, I’ll 
say buy your tickets here, they click here and go to my sales page. It asks 
how many tickets you want. If they buy one ticket they pay top price, if they 
buy four or five, I’ll take a couple dollars off. The more tickets you buy the 
less it is. It goes through PayPal and into my bank account. Ka-ching and I’m 
ready.
I also do something else, I put on there that everybody who goes to my 
website and buys a ticket I’m going to give them two free audio CDs that are 
worth more than the cost of the ticket. A lot of value there, so they come there 
and spend $15 and I’ll give them $30 to $40 in products.
What does it cost me to do that, to give them something like that? I don’t 
know maybe $.50 who knows. It’s digital. It took me time to create it. I had to 
write out scripts, record and edit it. I had to package it and put it on the 
website, upload it and do all the design work, because I do all my own design 
work on my website.  
I don’t know about anywhere else in the country, but where I am in South 
Carolina, we all have PTA associations and just to let you know, in my own 
personal business, it’s not the principal that runs the business of the school; 
his job is to run the school. It’s the head PTA teacher association and they’re 
always doing fundraisers, so they’re looking for new material and they will 
split the funds with you that you bring into it.

They will market and advertise. They’ll send it home through their kids 
throughout the entire school system and you can get your name out there. 
For instance, I’ll go and speak to the parents about college education and 
doing different things to get better grants for schools and the PTA Association 
will actually charge at the door to have people come and they want to hear it, 
so they’re always looking for a fundraiser, so that’s a great idea. 
Let me talk a little bit more on that so we don’t get too far off.
I do a lot of fundraisers, they area great way to make money. It costs you 
absolutely nothing to do. In fact, I did one two months ago at this little high 
school called Eureka in the north country of where I live. They had me do it 
last year and I had so much bloody fun I did it again this year, they asked me 
to come back.
It’s not bad, I go do a fundraiser, they do all the work, I walk away with over 
$2500 and they walked away raising like $4000 themselves. I don’t care. It’s 
a community service thing for me. They do all the work and I still didn’t get 
paid a bad salary, I got paid very well and it was only an hour drive from 
where I live. They put me up in a hotel for the night. I sold a bunch of 
products at the end of it.
That’s what I was going to say then you can sell all your products at the back 
door.
That’s right at the back of the room. It’s a no-brainer. I’ve got the whole 
fundraising thing down. If you need more information you know where to find 
me, go to my website and drop me an email so we can talk more about that. 
When you do a for-wall, do you arrange preliminary acts for yourself or do 
you just do it all by yourself?
It depends. For example, a couple years ago I opened a non-smoking 
comedy club in Kalispell and I ran it for three months, then I got divorced and 
took some time off to deal with that. What I did there was a lot of fun because 
I did a weekly show and I had comics come in who would do…I did my show 
once or twice a month, because it was always the biggest thing that 
happened there. 
I would have comedians come in and there’d be an opening act for 20 
minutes and then I would do the headliner. Same thing comics, you have an 
opening act and then you have a headliner.
Did you pay the comics or do you negotiate?
I tell them what I’m going to pay them. If they want to work in my club they’re 
going to take what they get, it’s pretty simple.

Back to the equipment…are you schlepping all that from venue to venue? Do 
you take all that equipment with you?
If the venue doesn’t have it I take it with me. 
How does that translate when you travel?
If I have to travel, it depends, if I’m traveling within three hours its no big deal, 
I’ve got a mini van that will haul all my road gear, so I have a road van that 
goes with me when I do local stuff. If I jump on a plane and go somewhere, I 
just hire a local DJ, I don’t worry about it and they do all this.
This is your basic setup if you have your own equipment. Even locally I hardly 
take mine out of the garage anymore, because I have people I can pay to do 
it all. I don’t want to lift anything anymore. I’m tired. Maybe when my son gets 
bigger he can do it for me, but right now he’s not big enough.

Types Of Venues
When you’re working at high schools and colleges, the people are floppers. 
They’re easy to work with when you’re doing a hypnosis show. The easiest 
shows you’ll ever do is working the high schools and colleges, because 
they’re highly responsive, they’re a lot of fun so you can walk up to them, sit 
them down in the chairs and say sleep, sleep, sleep and have a lot of fun with 
it.
The induction is nothing more then just dramatic. It adds a layer of suspense 
and drama to your show, so please do that also because it looks cool. People 
like to see people get hypnotized, falling all over and you’ll see some people
dropping sooner than others. Working with them is different than working in a 
nightclub or in a corporate gig where people are a little more hardwired to 
who they think they are, so your job is a little more difficult, because they’re 
either drinking or they have rigidity of thought because of where they are.
Military is different too. If you happen to get a gig on a military base, which is 
very uncommon because they tell you to never let yourself be hypnotized. 
But, if you happen to get onto a military base…and I had a lady who called 
me on this a while back, because she was thinking about doing mentoring 
with me…she decided she couldn’t afford it so she paid me by the hour to just 
talk to me and get some feedback.
I think she made a big mistake, but she was doing this military base and she 
said nobody would get hypnotized, I didn’t know what to do. I said well, what 
did you do? She goes I couldn’t do anything. I said and that’s why you need a 
mentor. Had you talked to me beforehand we could have eliminated that 
problem right off, because there’s a way you talk to people in the military that 
you can’t talk to the general population.
You have to go in the back door with the military, in the way that their mind 
processes information. Hopefully, you have enough skills to do that. I don’t 
have enough time to go into detail about how to do that exactly with the 
military, because it’s a whole different hypnotic process. But, if you think you 
can go to the military and do a regular show, think twice it’s going to be very 
difficult because they’re trained to not be receptive to people who are 
hypnotists or interrogating them.
You the hypnotist are an interrogator to them, so you have to learn how to 
talk to them, because they’re very rigid. It’s the same thing with police 
officers. You’ll have the same thing with cops up on stage, so you have to 
take an entirely different approach with these individuals because they’re 
trained to resist people like us.

402
Who wants to work on a cruise ship?
Hell yeah.
Here’s what you have to do. You have to get a hold of the cruise director, the 
entertainment director on the cruise ship. You have to bang on doors and 
sending out promo stuff. You have to go knock on the door and if I were you I 
would go meet them personally. If you want to go on a cruise line go down 
and meet them personally. Take a cruise. The cruise director is usually on 
there.
They already have entertainment, say hey listen I’m a hypnotist. Maybe they’ll 
let you get up there and do something real quick, who knows? That’s how 
you get on a cruise ship you’ve got to talk to the entertainment director 
because they book all the shows. 
Now, you’ll get a lot of entertainment directors on cruise ships and in places 
like Las Vegas and in casinos around the country that will only work through 
a talent agency. How do you get into a talent agency? The same way, like 
this, and if you don’t have all the big references under your name you fake it 
till you make it. 
Go meet these people personally, develop a relationship with them because if 
you think you’re going to pick up the phone and say hey, my name’s Spencer 
man I’m a hypnotist and I’ve got nothing to back that up, can you put me on 
your roster of entertainers? They’re going to say who the hell are you? 
Because they have dozens of people with big names that have worldwide 
followers, so the best way to do that is to go wherever their office is, knock on 
their doors and have a meeting with them.
When you’re dealing with talent agents and things like that, honestly, the best 
way is to network. Take the time, spend the money, go knock on their door 
and take them out to lunch. Build a relationship with them and let them know 
you’re a real person, you’re good at what you do, you’re looking for some 
work and would they support you in it. Does that make sense? It’s not easy, 
but it can be done.
I’m not creating a downer for anybody here am I?
No.
Giving you a lot of good ideas, right?
Yes.
Do you want to know the business of show business? You’re going to get it 
from me, here it comes.

How to book a theater? The theater is no different than any other gig. If you 
go to a nice theater that seats 2000 people, a very ornate thing in your local 
community, they’re going to charge you $2000 - $3000 a night to book a 
show. Then they’re probably going to want to take a cut out of your profit. 
But on the upside, when you work with a theater they will also do ticket sales 
for you, which they’ll take a percentage from. They’ll have a ticketing agency 
they work with. And for the most part they also have to work with unions, so 
you have to have union techs working on-site also, so there’s a lot of extra 
expense like security and staff that comes into play that you have to figure 
into your hypnosis show if you want to work in a larger venue.
Now, that’s if you’re buying it and for-walling it. You may be able to sell it to 
them. If you want to sell your show to a theater or to somebody else, then 
you’ll want to find a sponsor. A sponsor is a person who pays you a lot of 
money $500, $1000 or $5000. They give that to you so that they can be 
associated with you and your show. 
They want that, because when you do a show and they have a poster of you 
out there, their name is on their, whether it’s Hertz or Nike, Nokia, Marlboro, 
whoever it is, they get to put their name on there. It’s play money to them, but 
they want to make sure it’s branded correctly, so if you’re good at what you 
do, you treat people right and you have a good reputation, you might pick up 
a sponsor and that’s always a good thing.
When I went to Dubai I had a sponsor who paid for all my limousine services. 
I had a sponsor who paid for my hotels. I had a sponsor that bought my 
roundtrip first-class airfare, that’s $15,000 to $16,000 just for that. I don’t want 
to pay for that. I could go coach for $1000, but why? Why, when you can sit in 
first-class in little cubicles where your chair reclines and has a little vibrating 
massager on it, you have your own private little TV and you get free drinks 
and food the entire trip? Why go coach when you can go first-class? 
Especially when you have a sponsor, so when you work it out right you find 
sponsors to help you and you can find sponsors even at this level. When I do 
shows I look for sponsors. Hell, even in Kalispell, I’ll go around to people I 
know and say hey, how would you like to sponsor this thing? They ask what I 
mean and I say well, I have to sell tickets, etc. 
It’s like, you could use more help in your business so just imagine, 200-300 
people out there hypnotized when I say go shopping at the Redneck check, 
would that not be cool? I really have a sponsor with that name in Montana. 
She has this antique store and boutique, she’s a cool lady.
Do you see what I’m saying? Who in your community can do that? Maybe it’s 
the local insurance agency. Maybe it’s a local automotive dealer. Automotive 
dealers are cool, somebody who worked for me did it, went to this automotive 

404
dealer and said listen, we need a sponsor and this guy bought 50 tickets on 
the spot to the show so that we would put his name on our posters.
Isn’t that cool? What he did was he took the 50 tickets and then he put an ad 
in the paper telling people that he was giving away free tickets to the comedy 
hypnosis show for Spencer at SleepNow.com. How much more free publicity 
did I get from that?
A lot.
You see what I’m saying. Am I getting the wheels turning here? There are a 
lot of ways that you can promote yourselves, just be creative. The sky is the 
limit in this business.

Extra Cash
How to make extra cash? Again, the back of the room. People are going to 
buy the stop smoking/weight loss/stress management/insomnia…that’s what I 
sell the most of. I don’t carry anything with me anymore because that’s what 
people buy. They also buy my hypno-sex. They really do, when I’m doing 
these shows and there again, if you don’t have that yet I encourage you 
strongly to get that, because it has everything you need in there that people 
will buy in the back of the room.
If you already have your own products, feel free to use them, if you don’t, 
don’t rewrite the will. Get it, use it, take the products you know, copy them 
and put your name on there it doesn’t matter. It’s already done, so make life 
simple for yourself. So that’s where the money is, there’s a lot of money in the 
back room sales. 
Besides that, when you’re doing your show, other extra cash is your weekend 
seminars. Say you do a show on a Thursday or Friday night, Saturday night 
you’re doing a seminar or Saturday afternoon you’re doing a seminar. Or, 
you’re going to spend the weekend, you do a show Saturday night...the best 
nights to do a show are Wednesday through Saturday. Stay away from 
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.
I wouldn’t do it those days unless somebody else buys you and pays you to 
do it as a corporate gig. Do not try to for-wall yourself on a Sunday, Monday 
or Tuesday. Wednesday is iffy, Thursday is iffy, Friday and Saturday are no-
brainers, but you’re in competition for all the other local things because 
weekends is the time when people party, so that’s the time to do it.
Weekend seminars, also when you’re doing your shows, people are going to 
want hypnotherapy, be prepared to spend an extra day. If you do a show 
Friday night, hey I’ll be here all day tomorrow. If you need hypnotherapy I’ll be 
here. Its $150 a session or whatever you want to charge, have them come to 
your hotel room and make sure you have a nice suite so they don’t feel like 
they’re in the fleabag road kill motel from hell.
Make sure you’re in a nice five-star hotel suite and everything is made up so 
they don’t feel uncomfortable coming to your room and make sure when you 
do a show that you videotape each and every show. People up here will buy 
videotapes to your show. They will buy videotapes of what happened, so 
videotape each and every show because you’ll make an extra $20-$40 for 
every person that buys a videotape. 
If you have 10 people up here, multiply that by 30, which gives you some 
extra chunk change there also.

Maybe I’m a little bit beyond this, because before you were talking about how 
great your show was keeping it clean and how a clean show gets you the 
greatest audience, but I see a lot of hypnotists here on the strip and big 
venues like in New York or Las Vegas. They have a technique called a 
handshake orgasm.
I know it sounds weird but here on the strip there are a lot of big time 
hypnotists that do that. How would that fit into our venue? What we’re trying 
to do right now in order to make the most money?
That’s not weird. I’m going to answer this and then I’m done.
I would say this, if you’re working in a nightclub and that’s what people 
expect, have fun with it. If you want to make the most money, stay away from 
it. That’s all I can say in what you’re doing. 
Here in Vegas, this is sin city, people want to see nutty, fruity, crazy things so 
if I walk up to somebody and it’s been a great show, when I shake your hand 
you’re going to have the most incredibly orgasm you’ve ever had in your 
entire life, goodnight. You can do that if that’s what you want to be known as 
and Igor mentioned that yesterday, if you want to be known as that, you will 
be labeled as that and people will always know you for that which will limit 
you in what you can do.
That said, we’re going to break, time is up and we’ll talk to you afterwards
Did you all learn a lot?

DVD 14 – Your State Hypnosis Business Questions Answered
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Q&A Session
Wow, I didn’t realize I was doing another segment. I’ve got to see what 
we’re doing. I was crunching all this stuff thinking, man, I’m out of time. 
Wow. I don’t have anything else to say now. 
What about hypnotherapy?
Hypnotherapy? Oh boy, you guys are so needy. I’m going to have to do 
some hypnotherapy, I guess. I say that in a loving way, of course. What I 
want to do is give you a little bit of Q&A because if you have any more 
specific questions – I mean there’s a lot to cover. In the business, I covered 
a lot of information there, I know. 
We talked about agents, colleges, high schools, clubs, military, theaters, 
cruise ships and so on. So there’s a lot of information. We talked about 
insurance, where to get insurance and everything else. If you have more 
specific questions, I want you to ask me that because, truly, I am here for 
you. If there’s a question you have on your mind that you did not ask me, I 
am not going to be responsible for that because I’m going to do my best to 
give you everything that I’ve got. 
So if there’s something specific, now is your time to please, please ask me 
that question specifically. If you’ve got a microphone, please stand up back 
there, my dear.
Hello. I just want to find out what length of time does it take to promote a gig 
if you’re going to for-wall it yourself?
That is an excellent question. Her question is how long does it take – how 
much leeway should you give yourself if you’re going to do a show? Boy oh 
boy oh. That’s a dandy question. There are so many answers to it. So I’m 
going to give you three of them.
1. I don’t know.
2. As a rule of thumb, if you’re doing a large venue, like in a theater, 
you want to give yourself anywhere between – I’m talking about a 
theater that seats 2,000 or 3,000 people, right. One of these nice 
theaters where they do operas and things at. If you’re doing a gig like 
that, you’re going to give yourself three to six months.

408
Truthfully, when you’re working with those theaters, they aren’t going to 
deal with you unless you have at least three to six months to work with, 
preferably six months. They’ve got these things booked out way far out 
ahead of time, and they’ve got it down to a rocket science, and they want 
that much time to help you promote your show so that it’s successful.
3. That said I’ve put together a show in a week.
Would that be for a local gig?
For a local gig? Yeah, it can be for a local gig. Here’s an interesting thought 
on that. The thing I just did in Dubai – there again, a lot of it’s a cultural 
thing, too. When we put that together, I was approached on that – is this 
March? Okay, I was there in February 8, 9, 10 to the 16th and I stayed 
another week. We did not start promoting that until a month before. 
I was telling the guy, I said you know what? We do not have enough time. I 
mean this is insane. We’re spending over $40,000 to do this. That’s not 
enough time. You know what? Small market, social networking, it was a 
click, I’m a hypnotist, I’m an American, I’ve got a good résumé, people went 
there and saw it and said, let’s go do it.
And you got full shows out of that?
What?
You got full shows out of that?
We had nice full shows, and then we got invited to a place called Kavali’s, 
where they just wanted me to do a demonstration. So we went there and 
they paid me to go over there just to have appearance. I didn’t have to do 
anything, just appear. 
Thank you.
After that, they hired me to come back and do a show a week later. Then 
they put me up in a nice flat for a week. So you never know when you get 
going with it, but if you’re doing a local gig – for example, let’s say you’re 
doing the local Lion’s Club in your home town, give yourself a month for 
promotion.
Here’s why. Because when you do the promotions in your local market –
and maybe six weeks might be better – because you want to make sure 
that you get in all the local rags, the newspapers, the throwaways and 
everything, and you can get free listings in all of those. If you go to the 
newspapers and on the Internet, now they have a place to submit your 
event. So submit your event. Do it in advance. Give it six weeks so people 
can read about it.

Then a lot of magazines are monthly magazines, all your big entertainment 
magazines in a lot of your smaller municipalities, and they come out once a 
month. So you want to have that time to put it in there, even if it’s a free 
listing, or if you take out a nice quarter page or half page or full page ad, 
which is going to cost you more money. You want to make sure that you 
have enough time to get it into every paper that everybody’s going to be 
reading.
Every market will dictate where you want to spend money on promotion. 
Hands down, if you’re going to spend money on promotions, radio is the 
best. There again, talk to your local market and find out how to do it. It’s 
changing. 
There used to be in the day where you could go into any town and get radio 
interviews. A lot of the bigger radio stations now, the ones that are owned 
by larger corporations, unless you spend a lot of money for advertising, they 
will not have you come in for an interview. There again, that’s in the states 
anymore. Some of the smaller stations that are locally owned will be happy 
to have you come in for an interview. There again, you have to still do the 
work. Knock, knock, knock on doors. 
The thing that I like to do after I’m done with interviews with the radio 
people is like to send them a little gift as a thank you. If they drink, I can 
send them a nice bottle of champagne or a nice bottle of vino. Or if it’s a 
lady, I’ll send them some flowers or send them a couple of tickets to a 
dinner somewhere. Just treat them good. They took care of you, so take 
care of them. Then they’ll be happy to have you come back for another 
interview the next time you come to town.
Six weeks, depending on if you’re doing a fund raiser where you’ve got a 
whole school doing all the work for you. That makes it really nice. 
What kind of skits do you prefer when you’re doing corporate work?
What type of skits do I prefer?
Yeah. Is there anything in particular that you go for? I mean you’re not 
going to be doing the strip teases and stuff like that necessarily.
Yes, I will. I’ll do a strip tease, but I’ll strip it down so it’s not so teasing. Do 
you see what I’m saying? You can do these same routines. I have my same 
routines that I’ve done for years. It’s just that how I present them may 
change between a nightclub, a college or a corporate clean show. 
So I’ll change how I structure it and the way that I use words. My 
vocabulary may change, obviously, because I don’t want to use curse 
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:

410
words that may slip out in a nightclub-type environment where they kind of 
expect that. 
What I do in that kind of situation is I put the onerous on the individuals. I 
will give a suggestion and let them make up the bloops, the blips and the 
blunders. If they do it, then it’s okay. I just say, whoa. If they do it, it’s their 
fault, and if I do it, then it looks bad on me. 
I know you’re at the point now where you can probably sit back and people 
just call you. Hey, Don, come do a show. In the beginning you had to bust 
your keester. How long do you think you were just pounding it and pounding 
it before they just started calling you?
You know what? I think that there are days when I still feel like I’m pounding 
it. No matter how long you’ve been in this business. Doing stage hypnosis I 
think is a whole different level of entertainment than if you’re a rock star or 
something like that and you have millions of followers around the world 
because we don’t have an original song that everybody’s going to be 
singing. So it’s a different kind of structure.
So I think the way that I like to look at it is, you know what? When the 
rollercoaster’s going, jump on and just go with the flow. If it’s going downhill 
and you’re just flying, go with it because tomorrow it may be going uphill 
and it might be a little bit more of a struggle. That’s how I look at that. 
Thanks.
Sure. To answer that a little bit more specifically, also because I busted my 
butt for about five years doing a lot of nightclubs, I worked the nightclub 
circuit hard. I was living in Salt Lake City, and I worked everything between 
Salt Lake; Provo; Ogden; Twin Falls, Idaho; Boise, Idaho; Jackson Hole, 
Wyoming; St. George, Utah; Wendover, Nevada; Sun Valley, Idaho; Park 
City; Deer Valley; and every municipality and every city you could imagine 
in Utah, Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming because that was my region.
I worked a lot of those just going around doing nightclubs. I worked really 
hard doing all those for about five years. After doing that, a lot of them knew 
me and I’d just call them up and say, hey, I’m going to be in town next 
week, can you get me on. They’d say yeah, right on, we’d love to see you 
again. 
There’s a lot of follow up. So if you go and do a good show, and people are 
happy and they’re making money, then they’re going to want to have you 
back. But I busted my butt for a number of years, and then I think what 
really helped me too is when I began working in the theater for 6 ½ years 
because I had anywhere from 300, 400 or 500 people a week coming to my 
show. So then you have a whole different level because you’ve got all these 
people, and you’re consistent.

You’ve drive down State Street, and you’re always seeing your sign up 
there – World’s Fastest Hypnotist, Every Saturday Night. When you 70,000 
drive-bys a day seeing it, that’s pretty good publicity. Then all of the 
sudden, all the people in the Utah market starting calling me for corporate 
gigs.
Then I had people who would come to the show that were in Salt Lake and 
had heard about me who were from outside the area. Then they would 
begin calling me for corporate gigs because they had recognized me. Then 
I would get people from around the world calling me. Hollywood called me 
for some gigs, so I got those also doing some fun stuff. 
So it will snowball?
It will snowball, but you’ve got to put in the work. If you put in the work, the 
effort, and make yourself known, it’s going to happen. If you want to be a 
celebrity in your local market, find yourself a place to do a show and do it 
every single week. Do it. If you do it, you’re going to get a following. If you 
live in a small place where you don’t have enough people to come every 
week, sacrifice people. Sacrifice. You’re going to have to move to a bigger 
city. 
Make it happen, even if you have to get on a plane and fly. Where I live, 
there’s nobody there. I could probably do a show once a month and get 
away with it because people are just bored to death and they want 
something to do.
Do you do the same show every week if you’re doing it in the same place?
Guess what? Here’s the nice thing about being a hypnotist. You can do the 
same show in the same place every week and have a different audience, 
and it’s always a new show. But I do have a lot of routines where I can 
change it up. 
I’m sorry, you’ve mentioned a couple of times about problems with doing 
military and police people. Can you give us a three-minute real short what 
the problem is and a better way to approach it, just a three minute blurp?
Oh how you go in the back door? You want to know the real deep secrets?
Well, yeah. That’s why I’m here.
Oh you’re here for the military? 
No, if there’s a potential problem, I’d like to run into it before I hit it.

All you have to do is go to the Middle East, and you’re on their list. Yeah, 
you go in the back door, it’s the same thing. All I do is I just become the drill 
sergeant. That’s real simple. I just become the drill sergeant at that point. I’ll 
just play the routine. Listen, this whole thing is just an act anyway. So it 
doesn’t matter where I’m at, I’ll just fall into the role of where I think I need 
to be to fit the scenario.
If I’m doing a corporate gig, I’m not going to be as crazy and animated as I 
normally am. I’ll just be a little bit more reserved, a little bit more 
conventional and I’ll change my movements. I’ll be a little bit more elegant. 
I’ll be more like Igor, which is a good thing. He has a style of presentation 
that he does, so I will move into this role in a corporate situation to make 
sure that everybody is following along with what I have to say. 
So I’ll just switch my personality in order to give the experience that people 
need. Military is very structured and rigid. It’s kind of like, sit back in your 
chairs. Now I want to tell you right now that you will not tell me any of your 
secrets. I am not here to get any military secrets from you. You are here for 
one reason and one reason alone, and that is to have a good time. Usually, 
that’s enough for me to get what I need out of them.
Does that help? Okay, sure. 
You had mentioned that you sell the DVD of the show.
Yes, ma’am.
How do you do that because it’s going to take a little while to get that?
There are two ways to do that.
1. You can travel with a DVD recorder that duplicates four, five or six 
CDs or DVDs at a time. You can do your show and have that all 
prepared within about 15 minutes. Everything’s done. Here you go. 
People are going to be hanging around that long.
2. If you don’t have that capacity, because that will cost you an extra 
grand to get a machine that does that, you can simply just tell them 
you’ll have it to them in a week or two. Go home, make dupes and 
send it to them.
Which way is the best? Have them fill out a coupon with name, address and 
all that good stuff?
Yeah, what I do is when somebody wants that – for example, let’s say I just 
did a show and you want a copy of my tape, and I don’t have any way to 

413
reproduce it right now. So I just simply say all I need is a check and I’ll have 
that out to you in about a week. 
Money, money, money, money– money talks and bullshit walks. This is 
true. Listen, check this out. Now this is about as crazy as it gets. I was 
doing this show in Dubai and I told everybody up on stage, if you’re up here 
on stage, I invite you to come back tomorrow night, no charge, it’s on me 
because you were on stage, and I want you to watch the show. I do that in 
my shows for people who were up on stage. I invite them to come back to 
the next show if I’m going to be there.
So this one guy comes up and goes, Mr. Spencer, I’m not going to be here 
tomorrow night, so can I have one of your DVDs instead for the cost of 
that? I go, of course not. He wanted a DVD on how to hypnotize in 
exchange for not being there the next night. He goes, but if I’m not going to 
be here and you were going to give me a seat anyway, why can’t I have a 
DVD? I said, because you can’t. You’re either here or you’re not. It’s not a 
big deal. 
When you were talking about wardrobe before, is that a tax write-off? And 
your stage appearance?
Yeah. Your whole life is a write-off. I love it. 
Are there any other peculiar things that we might not think of?
The cool thing about it is your life, basically, does become a write-off. If 
there are any tax accountants in here, tell me I’m wrong or correct me. Your 
wardrobe – hey, this watch, I bought it for my show. I got this jewelry for my 
show. I bought these for my show. This shirt is for my show. I have to go 
out to dinner to talk to somebody. It’s for my show. I have to drive from here 
to there, I’ve got write it off. It’s for my show. 
Do you think I’d cut my hair if it wasn’t for my show? No, I would not. You’ve 
got to have the look. So everything actually becomes a write-off. There 
again, I will instruct you to talk to your tax accountant and let them give you 
legal advice on that. Personally, everything is a write-off because you are 
the product. As a stage hypnotist, you’re the product. So it’s pretty groovy. 
A couple of things. Wouldn’t you say, first of all, just to kind of ponder a 
minute, that in a way, we’re getting a break in a way that hypnosis has kind 
of come a long ways since 25 years ago. I imagine it was really difficult 
breaking in 25 years ago. It seems to have gained some more credibility. 
The second thing is when you say you do a demo after your show, what’s a 
demo?
I never said I do a demo, but let address the first thing you said. Hypnosis 
has come a long way over the last 25 years. I give a lot of credit of that to 
the stage hypnotist. Truthfully, without the stage hypnotist, most hypnosis 
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:

414
would go away because the stage hypnotist creates and excites the 
imagination for a lot of people. It has given credibility to the field of 
hypnotherapy.
I started as a hypnotherapist. When I started as a hypnotherapist years 
ago, we were in about the same position as 20 years before than when 
chiropractors real quack-o-practors. That’s what they were. Now they’re just 
a money-making machine. No offense to anybody who’s a chiropractor. You 
have fine tuned it like dentists have also. They’ve learned how to make a lot 
of money doing their profession.
Hypnotherapists now some people have also brought that to a level where 
they have streamlined it into programs that make them a lot of money at the 
same time. So hypnosis has come a long way over the last 20 years. Thank 
you mostly to the ongoing workings of the stage hypnotist and to those 
people in the hypnotherapy profession who have worked very, very hard to 
bring it to a level of excellence and professionalism that it deserves.
In truth, the professional hypnotherapist is more highly qualified to deal with 
the human psyche than any psychologist or any psychiatrist that I’ve ever 
met. How many of you would agree with that statement? That’s right 
because it’s a specialized field. We are masters in working with the human 
mind. 
We have taken the time to learn what motivates human beings to do what 
they 
do. We learned 
things 
like 
hypnotherapy, 
hypnosis, 
NLP, 
neurolinguistic programming, and we learned all these other mind 
technologies that help us to help other people to understand why people do 
what they do. Why do we make the decisions that we do? 
The keen observer of human beings, being most of us in this room, we are 
in a unique position to be great people-helpers on this planet, better than 
anybody else. I think, for me, what I like more than anything is that I have a 
unique perspective on human beings that few other people have. 
Part of that comes from being a stage hypnotist too, not just being a 
hypnotherapist, which is where I began. That gave me one perspective on 
people, but going in to the world of stage hypnosis, you have a whole 
different dimension. So when I bring that all together, I’m just going, whoa. 
It’s kind of a nutty, fruity world we live in. 

415
What To Charge
Student:
Spencer:
Regarding travel, would you suggest the radius? I know that you get paid 
for your travel, but for someone who’s starting out, when do you negotiate 
travel? I know what local might be, but when do you start charging? I mean 
Joe got $2,500, but how do you know…
The easiest way to do that is just look at where you’re going, and you figure 
that in on the cost. Let’s say, for example, that you live here in Las Vegas, 
and somebody wants you to go to LA to do a show. You can jump on a 
plane roundtrip for probably $150 or something like that. Or you can drive 
down there in about five hours one way and about five hours back.
What I would do is I wouldn’t say, well, I’m going to charge you $2,000 plus 
expenses. I would just say $3,000, all inclusive. They don’t want to have to 
deal with that. They don’t want to have to deal with what do you mean 
expenses? What do you mean plus lodging? No, $3,000 all-inclusive and 
then you take care of all the incidentals so that they don’t have to. Make it 
as easy as you possibly can for them. 
That said, there are two dimensions to this. Often times when people 
contact me, I’ll give them a choice of what kind of a show they want. My first 
question when somebody calls me is, what is your budget? I want to know 
what their budget is.
They go, we’re thinking about doing a show over here in Los Angeles, and I 
know you live in Las Vegas. What do you charge? I go well, let me ask you 
first, who is this for? I want to know who the show is for. Ask who it’s for. 
Let me write this down. Maybe this will help. I will switch into my teacher 
role now. 
Who is the show for?
Where is the show at?
What’s it for?
Who is going to tell me how much money they have? If it’s a large 
corporation, like IBM and they’ve got like 20,000 employees, they got some 
Ka-chunk change to spend. Not a big deal. So I want to know who they are.
Where it’s going to be is going to tell me where I have to go. If it’s only an 
hour away it’s not a big deal. If it’s four or five hours away or cross-country, 
it’s going to add another dimension to it. I’ll ask what it’s for meaning is it a 
private party? Is it a corporate function? What kind of an event is it for? 
What’s happening? Who’s going to be there and where is it going to be? 

416
Then my next question is:
What’s your budget?
They’ll say oh, we were thinking maybe about $500. I say, well, you know 
what? Wow, $500. I think I could find somebody who may be able to do that 
for you. I give them two choices. I say here’s how I work. I can give you a 
couple of different options, and I’m going to be happy to send that to you in 
an email. Then I’ll write it down in an email. 
When is the event?
When is the next question? When are you thinking about doing this 
because I have to check my calendar? I’ve got to make sure that day is 
even available to me. If the day is available to me, then we’ll talk further. So 
the plot, it thickens.
I want to know when. Oh man, I don’t think I can do it on that date because 
I’m booked up. Or, you know I’ve got something that’s going to be over here 
that’s close to you, so I might be able to squeeze you in and give you a 
better rate. If I can’t, if I have nothing there, then here are your options:
1. Do you want a show where I just come there and give you a 
performance, a comedy hypnosis show for your group of 500; or
2. Do you want a production? A production is going to cost a little bit 
more, but it’s a whole lot more fun.
The difference in price is about $2,000. Do you want a lower-end one that’s 
going to cost you $2,000 or would you like one that might cost you $4,000? 
Depending on the location, it could be $3,000 or it could be $6,000. Do you 
see what I’m saying?
And the difference in a production at a low-end is…
The difference in a production is if I’m going to do a production, I’m going to 
make sure that I have special lights, effects and different effect lighting and 
everything else. So I’m going to build it up and make it look like a real cool 
show, like a Vegas show, more of a production. I’ll charge extra because 
I’m going to have to pay extra for it.
My work’s not going to be that much more, but I’m going to have to hire a 
crew to do everything else, and I’ll hire somebody locally to put that all 
together for me.

Hey. 
So you then said that you would send an email that has a couple of options. 
Then in the options, what do you do? Do you talk about door splits or 
different rates?
This has to do with corporate. If corporate calls me. Then after I talk to them 
on the phone, I tell them if I get an agreement that they want to do that, 
what I’m doing is I’m talking to them and I already have my computer open. 
I’ve got my contract out in front of me, and I’m already putting their name, 
date, phone number, everything in on the contract. Then I say listen, I’m 
going to ship you over a contract right now because I’m so busy right now, I 
don’t know if I can hold that date for you. 
So it’s already ready for them. Now all they have to do is just sign it and 
send it back, and then they’re obligated?
They have to send me a deposit within 72 hours or I can’t hold it because I 
don’t know – here’s the deal. I get so many calls. If somebody calls me 
tomorrow and says, I want to do a show on this date, and I say, well I don’t 
know. I promised it to these people, but they haven’t given me a deposit, 
and they want to pay me right now. These guys may beg out and I may lose 
both of them. I don’t want that to happen. 
It’s like selling a house. A few years ago, I was living in Mesa, Arizona. I 
had a very beautiful house on a golf course with a beautiful swimming pool 
in the backyard. I had to move from there, so I sold my house. I’ll be 
damned, the first person I sold it to gave me $2,000, but you always put the 
weasel clause in there. So he lost his $2,000 I got, because whatever fell 
through for him fell through. 
Then I finally sold my house about a week later, and I’ll be damned if the 
same day I sold it, some guy comes up to me and goes, I want to give you 
an extra $50,000 cash for your house. Oh yeah. Wasn’t that crazy? So what 
do you do? It’s the same thing. I always get the deposit up front, and then 
the balance within 30 days prior to the show. 
I have the contract out to them by email within five minutes. I say, all I need 
you to do is sign that and send it back to me by email right now, and then 
just put a deposit in the mail. Or I’ll send them a link to PayPal where they 
can send me a deposit. That’s why I have PayPal, automatic payment. I 
may lose a little bit, 2% of fees, but you know what? I’ve got it. I’ve got 
myself a deal. I’d rather take the deal right here, right now.

When you’re taking the bookings, are you concerned about asking them 
about the setup that they’re going to have? Are you going to ask them if 
they have a platform or a stage?
What happens is if corporate hires me, I tell them – it’s in the contract – I tell 
them what I need. It’s all spelled out in the contract. I say I need a riser. I 
need my riser to be a certain dimension, which is usually about 20 x 12. I 
need a backdrop, and I need microphones. I’ll hire a local DJ and he can do 
the rest of it. I just tell them I need a riser and that I’ll hire a local DJ to do 
the rest of it. 
All right, I have a question from a previous experience this past year. I had 
booked a gig for New Year’s Eve. They paid the deposit and they signed 
the contract. My contract states that they’ll pay me prior to performance –
not 30 days out. Two weeks out she cancelled on me because she 
rebooked the room to somebody else. How would you handle somebody 
breaking your contract?
A lawsuit. Just sue them. 
Do you feel that may hurt your reputation? Because whenever I’ve posted 
questions on the forum, they think it will ruin my reputation by having a 
lawsuit on the books.
This is business. If somebody hires me and they back out on it and if I lose 
it because I could have booked that for somebody else for maybe twice as 
much, they’re stealing from me. They are stealing from me. I don’t take it 
personally. Just sue them. No big deal.
I had two questions.
I chose shows like Montel. How do you go about getting gigs there? 
Another question is when you double up on a stage show, what’s the 
advantage of that?
When you double up on a stage show?
Yeah, some hypnotists here have two guys that do the routine. They work 
together on stage.
Is there an advantage to that?
What is the advantage?

419
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
There is no advantage. That’s just something they wanted to do. I prefer 
working by myself.
And TV gigs?
How do you get on TV appearances? How do you get on Montel and Oprah 
and all those other goofy shows? Jerry Springer, that’s easy. All you’ve got 
to do is be a redneck and say, I had hypno-sex with my neighbor’s dog. 
That’s pretty easy. And the cat was sure pissed off. I know it’s kind of raw.
If you want to get on those kinds of shows, honestly, every TV show has a 
production director. So go on the Internet, look up the show and find out 
who produces it, and send them a tape. 
If you want to do better than that, go to where they are, knock on the door, 
tell them who you are and give them a tape. Tell them who you are and 
show them what you’ve got. That’s how Hollywood works. Hollywood works 
best through networking. It’s not what you know; it’s who you know. If you 
want to know, you’ve got to get out there and bust your balls. 
There are a number of agencies you can be involved with down in L.A., that 
are good for socializing and networking with people. So if you want to get 
involved on that level, go down to LA and sign up with a few agencies down 
there. Most agencies down there you can sign up with them for nothing. 
They don’t care, if they get you a gig great for them. If they don’t, they 
haven’t lost anything. If they do, they get money off you. So it’s just another 
name on their roster. 
Other than that, I would go directly to the company that produces the 
various shows, and just begin to research who you need to talk to. You’ll 
find somebody in there. A lot of those places, they are looking for people 
like you. They want to have information from people like you. Then they can 
make a decision after they check you out. You never know. It’s a crap 
shoot. Hollywood is a crap shoot. It really is because you never know. 
Even when you’re doing a movie, you know what? They don’t always pick 
the smartest, best-looking, most talented person to do the show. They’re 
looking for a certain type. So these casting agents have something in their 
mind that they’re looking at when they’re typecasting people for a show. 
I may think I’m the perfect person for this part, but they may like the way 
this guy looks. There’s something about him that makes more sense than 
you; therefore, they’re going to hire him, who has absolutely no experience. 
I’m going to go, that sucks, but that’s Hollywood. Get used to rejection. If 
you want to be an actor or if you want to be a performer, get used to 
rejection. 

420
If you want to be the World’s Greatest Salesperson, get used to rejection 
because if you can’t handle rejection, you are not going to be able to go all 
the way that you need to go to be a successful stage hypnotist or 
successful in any other areas of your life. Does that make sense? You guys 
all know that. So just go for it, man. Just go for it. It’s a natural, normal part 
of life, man. 
When somebody says no to me, I go, how can I get around that? To me it’s 
nothing more than an opportunity for me to become better, to achieve 
greater things.
My personal curiosity, you say you tape every show.
I do.
You’ve been doing it…
Except the bad ones.
Have you ever done a bad one?
Oh, I have bad shows.
So do you have a library of like 20 years’ of shows.
I do. I have my very first show I ever did.
Are they tape or digital?
I have boxes full of every performance I’ve ever done. 
I want to see your first test.
Well, you know, I’m going to have to go back and look at the first show 
before I can make that commitment. 
Laughter
I’m going to do that. I’m going to do that for you guys, seriously. That’s a 
good challenge for me. I’m going to go back and find it. I’ll have to convert it 
from VHS.
From Polaroid. 
Yeah, from Polaroid. It should have been a beta. Beta is better than VHS, 
but it was VHS. I’ll do that. I’ll get it done some time in the next couple of 
months. Hold me to it. Write to me and let me know.

I was just going to say what a great marketing idea. Show you now and 
then say, look where I came from. I can teach you too.
Okay. Not a bad idea. 
I was going to say the same thing. We had the question how long did it 
take? Did you have a mentor like Don Spencer teaching you when you first 
came into the business?
Well okay, that’s a good question did I have a mentor? Let me answer that 
for you. When I first began doing this, no, I did not have a mentor. Back in 
my day – this makes me sound like an old guy – but back when I began 
doing this, there were no mentors to speak of. There were classes you 
could take on stage hypnosis. 
I took a class once with Orman McGill, who became a friend of mine. I don’t 
know if you all know who that was or are familiar with the name, but he was 
a good guy and I took a number of classes with him. I lived down in San 
Diego at the time, and I first studied hypnosis at a place called The 
Hypnotism Training Institute of San Diego. I studied there for a year and a 
half, three or four nights a week and on weekends.
Orman was part of the staff, and he came in four or five times during the 
year and a half. One of the classes he did was on stage hypnosis. I think it 
was only like a three- or four-hour class where he did some hypnosis on 
people and then he talked about it. 
Was it extensive? No. Did they have any mentors? No. I learned the hard 
way. I went around and I watched every stage hypnosis show I could 
possibly see. I watched every hypnotist that was out there doing anything at 
the time to see what they were doing. I said to myself, I can be better than 
that. I hope that you’re sitting out there right now looking at me saying, I can 
be better than Spencer because I want you to. 
That’s the attitude you have to have. I can be better than that guy. To me, if 
I get my ego out of the way, there are a lot of guys out there that do great 
shows. I think it’s awesome to watch people who do really good shows. So 
that’s how I learned. I just went out and began to watch people and I 
thought, you know what, I’ve got some cahonies, man. I can do that. So I 
just started doing it, and I just kind of like got out there and just started 
doing it. 
I’ll tell you what, if there were someone back then in that day that was a 
mentor that could have taken me by the hand and shown me the in’s and 
out’s, I would have hired them like that. No problem, just like I took flying 
lessons. I took flying lessons to learn how to fly a plane because I didn’t 
want to just do it by myself.

I wanted somebody to show me how to do it. Like here, get in there, all 
you’ve got to do is just go. There’s that control, pull that back and make 
sure you’ve got your foot down, man, and there you go. Pull back and have 
fun. I scared the hell out of my kids when I took them up. 
I hope this is not a silly question, but what do you consider a good show or 
a bad show? As long as it goes pretty good, what are you looking for, I 
guess, is what I’m getting it. 
What am I looking for?
Yeah, overall.
Here’s what I look for more than anything – and I don’t really care about the 
people that are hypnotized. They’re going to be goofy anyway. They’re just 
going to be hypnotized and they’re going to do whatever happens. I think 
what makes or breaks a show, is the performer. You are the show. That’s 
my point of view. 
I think the performer has to have charisma. You have to have stage 
presence. You have to look good. If there’s something unique about your 
performance where I’m going to go, I kind of liked that. That’s pretty cool 
how that works. One of the good things to build your performance is to 
study performers. Look at performers. How can you develop some of the 
style and flare that other performers have? How can you incorporate that 
into yourself?
It is an act. Yes, be yourself, but be bigger than yourself. Acting is nothing 
more than being bigger than yourself. That’s all it is. When you’re an actor 
on the stage, you just have to become bigger than what you normally are. 
When you’re on a stage production – who does stage work? 
Where’s Alex? You do stage work too and Alex does. Okay, you know that 
when you’re on the stage, you have to talk louder. You have to product 
yourself, and you have to be a little bit more animated about what you do in 
order to get that across to the audience that’s out there. Is that correct? 
Yeah, okay? 
It’s no different than doing a stage presentation. When I’m not up here, I’m 
just the guy out there eating salad with everybody else. But when I’m up 
here, I’m on. I try to do my best to be that thing, the hypnotist. Right now, I 
am the hypnotist. So I try to project myself bigger than what I am because 
I’m a small guy anyway. 

423
I have this thing that I do with myself. I do this by studying other people and 
what they do in their lives. I study actors. I study comedians. I study 
magicians. I study how they appear on stage and what they do. I’m looking 
for these nuances and how can I develop that and integrate that into what 
I’m doing to give the best performance possible. 
What do I look for? I don’t look at the people who are hypnotized I don’t 
care about that. When I look at other hypnotists’ shows, I’m looking at the 
person. I’m looking at how they come across to me. That’s what I look at. 
Yes, I was wondering what to do if you get somebody that does something 
that just cracks you up so bad you just lose it. What if they just do 
something that surprises you so much that you don’t know what to do?
I just laugh. I mean I go with the flow. I have people that do goofy things, 
and sometimes I’m so amazed by what they’re doing, I lose it. I don’t have a 
problem with that. I’m like everybody else. I’m seeing this for the first time 
too. So a lot of things, I know what a person’s going to do because I frame it 
that way, but within framing a scenario, I have no idea exactly how they’re 
going to respond. So I’m always amazed. 
There was another guy in a show and I gave him a suggestion and asked 
him who he was. I said, you’re your favorite TV character, and he stands up 
and says, I’m Superman. I go, really? So what can you do as Superman? 
He goes, I can fly. Then he runs off the side of the stage and jumps down. 
He dives off like he’s flying. At the theater, it’s a cement floor, so you hear 
this thug. I’m going, oh no. 
The people were out there going oh, dear God, and everything just stops. 
They’re looking at me going, you are in big trouble, dude. I was just hoping 
there wasn’t blood everywhere. I looked down and he looks at me and I go, 
are you all right? He goes, oh man that was cool!
Laughter
He gets back up on the stage. He didn’t get hurt. He landed just right. 
Knock on wood, whoever it is. You never know. 
I’ll tell you another one too. I think I told this at Lowe’s, but for those of you 
who weren’t there, I was doing another show. I had everybody as little 
children. You’re little 6-year-old kids and you’re having a good time. We’re 
going to go on a rollercoaster and we’re going to have a lot of fun. This is 
going to be great. You won’t get sick. You won’t wet your pants or anything 
like that.

So they’re sitting there, they pull down their safety bar and put on their 
seatbelts. They’re sitting there getting ready to go. They’re all excited. 
They’ve given me their tickets, and we’re ready to go. I look down and I can 
see this one guy’s face turning red. I’m going, not a good sign. Not a good 
sign. I walked over to this guy and go, the person I’m touching right now, 
your head is cool, calm and your stomach is relaxed. You feel good, perfect 
in every way. Take a deep breath and just relax all the way down.
You could see this guy breathing a sigh of relief. I’m going, all right, man. 
That was a close call. That was a close call. In just a moment, I’m going to 
count to three. The music will begin and we’re going to go for a ride. I look 
over and he’s freaking out. I go; calm and cool, everything is relaxed inside. 
He’s sitting there breathing deeply. I turn around and I go, that was another 
close call, folks. Let’s see if we can get this thing going. I turned around and 
all the sudden he’s losing it all over the stage. He just chucks. 
You know how big that stage was, right? This stage was huge, and this stuff 
was – I don’t know where it came from. I mean there was so much of it, and 
he did it like three times, three big heaves. That would be like my most 
embarrassing moment.
So the audience is out there freaking out, and all these people up here that 
were hypnotized that they’re little kids, they were like little kids going, ooh. It 
didn’t break their trances. They were all just going, ooh. He got sick. He 
threw up. I’m going, oh my gosh. 
So I said, will somebody please go get the manager of the theater and have 
him bring a mop up here? He was pretty pissed off at me, actually. He goes 
I’m not going to be cleaning that up. I said, Art, get up here and clean it up, 
man. I can’t do it because I’ve got a show to run. So he came up there with 
a little bucket and cleaned it all up. He was mad at me for about two months 
after that, but he cleaned it up. 
After he got that all cleaned up, I took the guy that threw up – after he was 
done, we gave him a towel and he cleaned himself off a little bit. I had one 
of my assistant’s who was a hypnotherapist at the time – I said, please take 
him outside and give him some fresh air and give him some water to drink. 
Give him whatever he wants. I think he had gone to Kentucky Fried Chicken 
that night or something. That’s all I can think from what I saw. So if you’re 
thinking about going out to dinner tonight, you might think twice. 
So anyway, what I did for this gentleman, and it was very nice because I 
gave him free passes to the show for the next year. The audience was very 
generous too because I took the time to take care of his needs. After I got 
done with that, the show continued. Everybody stayed in form, and I think 
there was about another 45 minutes left of the show.

How did you keep the energy going in between that?
The question was, how do I keep the energy going in between that? I didn’t 
need to. There was already enough energy out there. My sound guys just 
put on some music and I said, excuse us for a moment. Go out and have an 
Intermission. Go have some sodas and have some popcorn. Stay away 
from the chicken. As soon as we get this cleaned up, we’ll start the show 
back up again. 
Then my guy was down there he started playing music again, and the show 
just went on. You make it part of the show in a kind of sick sort of a way. 
Don, I don’t know whether you’ve had any problems with someone actually 
doing something bad to themselves, because they fell or broke something, 
like they’re injured.
I’ve never had a person injure themselves in my show, ever.
Okay, so maybe from experience talking to others or hearing about other 
experiences, how would you cope with such a situation, not to lose face 
going forward? Say that happened, what would you do?
If somebody hurt themselves?
Yes.
I would stop the show and make sure their needs were taken care of.
But after the show? Because there may some rumors like, don’t go and see 
Spence because you can get injured or something like that.
I don’t really worry about that. Listen, it could happen. I’m not saying it will 
never happen. The thing is, I would take care of it immediately on the spot. 
For example, if this guy that flew off the stage and hit the pavement would 
have gotten hurt, it would have been kind of a bummer, but I would have 
just simply explained to the audience, you know what? I did my best. That’s 
all you can do. All you can do is just try to take care of it in the moment. 
I honestly don’t know how I would take care of that. If it had gotten into the 
papers, I would want to do an interview with them and explain to them what 
happened and offer my apologies to them, and I would everything I could to 
help that person to feel better. That is why you have insurance, right?
That’s PR work. If something like that happens, you follow through and 
you’re generous. I mean, I am. I want to make sure that if something has 
happened wrong because of me that I can take care of it. I do. I’ve had 
people in my show – this is true. I’ve had people in my show that really 
need therapy. Really bad. They get up on stage and you’ll get people on 

426
your stage that have a borderline personality disorder. Not good because 
you can create a psychotic experience in somebody. 
This is part of the dangers of doing stage work. Thank goodness for me, I 
have years’ of background as hypnotherapist before I ever began doing a 
lot of work, so I knew how to navigate these experiences, and I learned how 
to read people very well. 
Part of the thing that you do will be learning how to read people. I can look 
at people and I can tell you your whole life’s story in about 15 seconds or 
less because I’ve been doing this for a long time. How does he do that? 
Yeah, I can tell you everything about what happened when you were little. 
So take care of your audience, yes.
What if you have somebody that’s trying to set you up in the show, like a 
real heckler that’s pretending to be hypnotized? How do watch out for that, 
like if it’s a comedy show, the audience is laughing and they’re making 
faces and coming out of trance? How do you watch out for that?
Well, when you’ve done enough shows you’ll notice when somebody’s just 
messing with you. The audience is normally very generous, and if they see 
something up there, they’ll say, oh that person’s faking it. So you just get 
them off the stage. That’s really the easiest way to do it because he 
audience is usually very generous. If there’s something that you don’t 
happen to catch yourself, they’re going to catch it. 
But you, the trained professional, competent, confident stage powerful 
hypnotist will notice this at all times, and do you know what you’re going to 
do? You’re going to get him off the stage. Thank you. Go out there and 
have more fun. 
Okay, so I would like to ask you – because I am a hypnotherapist, and I am 
here because I want to be quicker. So you work with the people after 
shows. How long does it take – hypnotherapy? People think that after your 
show, you will put them into trance in five minutes and they will not smoke. 
How long does your hypnotherapy take? Did you understand?
How long does it take my hypnotherapy?
Yeah, I have read on your pages that sometimes you help people.
Oh, like after a show? For example, if somebody comes up to me and they 
go can you work with me right now to stop smoking? Is that what you’re 
saying?
Yeah.

I say, call me tomorrow because I’m exhausted. But I have done that. If I 
work with somebody to do that, I’ll sit down with them for maybe 15 minutes 
and just do something really quick because they’re already in trance by 
what I’ve done. So they’re usually easy to work with. So as soon as they 
give me $100 or $200 or whatever I determine at that moment – I’ll say this 
is going to cost you $100. Thank you. Sit down. Let’s do this very quick. 
Boom! We’re done.
Does that help? If I’m going to be there for a couple days afterwards, I’ll 
have them come see me and give them an hour of my time, but after a 
show, I’m exhausted and the last thing I want to do is spend time talking to 
anybody. I’m tired. It’s like doing a class here all day. You get tired, and you 
need a break every once in a while. 
Since you’re asking for picking your brain, I have a question. It may not be 
totally applicable to others, but I find it’s been difficult to work with a bunch 
of scientists who think all the time. They’re just not good responders. 
So your question is how do you work with a bunch of scientists?
How do you work with them? You talk about working with military people,
right? Different kinds of people have certain things that you can…
Listen, here’s a very simple answer to that. If I’ve got a bunch of guys who 
are just a bunch of scientists, I think it’s kind of awesome. Thing about it. 
Some scientists work very uniquely. It’s very beautiful. It’s so awesome that 
you have the mind of a scientist because you like to discover things. You 
like to know how things work.
If you notice how your eyes close right now, do you see how that is? Yeah, 
they close because you thought about. With your eyes closed, if you were 
to think about it, you might even notice that there’s a space between your 
eyes and your eyelids there’s a light that comes on and goes off. If you 
were to think about it, there’s a bunch of little dots inside going back and 
forth, Mr. Scientist. Notice those? Nod your head.
I take them through this scientific process of self-discovery, and that just 
drops the person into trance. Does that make sense?
Yes.
So it’s a very non-evasive way for a person to learn how to go into a trance 
without really saying you’re going into a trance. So, if you have a bunch of 
people up here that are being hypnotized in a stage show who are 
scientists, I’d probably do it that same way, because you have to judge your 
crowd just like I do when I’m working with people. 

428
If I’m doing street hypnosis, I don’t think I can walk up to anybody and just 
say, sleep, and they’re going to drop. I think that would be kind of ludicrous 
to think that.
I want to talk to somebody for a little bit and find out a little bit more about 
who they are. For example, come up here, sir. Can I borrow you for a 
second? Ronald? For example, let’s Ronald here – and I don’t really know 
him. Ronald, what do you do?
I’m a retired Clergy. I worked for RCMP, the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police.
Okay, cool. Have you ever done hypnosis before? Say no.
No.
Okay, have you ever done hypnosis before?
No.
Good. See, I want to find out more about him. 
Let’s say that working for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. I might think 
that he may have a little resistance to hypnosis or trance, because coming 
from that area and being clergy, might bring up another red flag for me. 
Because sometimes when you deal with people in the religious sector, they 
may have a preconceived idea about what hypnosis is. It’s the evil 
hypnotist, the mark of the Beast!
That’s one of the things we talked about earlier. Twenty years ago, I had 
fights with people in the newspaper because they were saying I was from 
Satan and that what I did was evil. That being a hypnotist was satanic. It’s 
crazy the way people approached that.
I’ve got the Jesus thing. You should have seen me when my hair was long. 
I got a lot of that, yeah. Anyway, let’s just say that he is – and he is with the 
clergy and the RCMP, I might approach that differently because he might 
be going, well, you know, I’d kind of like to try that, but I’m not really certain 
about that. I think it might kind of not my deal. 
I know you would never say that, but let’s just say that you would say that. 
So before I would even try to do street hypnosis with an individual like that, 
like a scientist, I want to know more about him. Who are you? Where do 
you come from? Because he wants to try it, but he’s kind of a little bit afraid 
of it. Instead of my saying, sleep – because he’s going to probably look at 
me and go, I don’t think so. That’s not going to happen.

I’m going to talk to him a little more and get to know him. I want to find out 
more about him. What’s it like being in the clergy?
Well, it’s like a lot of things. For me, it was wonderful. Some of my worst 
friends were fellow clergy. 
The interesting thing that I find about being in the clergy is that you pray a 
lot, right?
I do.
Please pay attention because this is important. This is what you do. You 
have got to go into somebody else’s reality, no matter what you do. I want 
to know what he is. Somehow I’ve got to relate what I do to what it is that he 
does. So in the clergy, you pray.
Pray and meditate.
And meditate. That’s interesting because what I do in hypnosis is a lot like 
prayer and meditation. It’s exactly the same stage of mind. For example, 
when you calm yourself and you go into prayer, what you’re doing is 
communicating with God and you’re being very, very quiet inside, right?
That’s right.
Well, hypnosis is really the same thing. What you’re doing is really the 
same exact state of mind because your brain is working at the same 
frequency. You have different levels of awareness. Beta- when you’re 
awake. Then, the brainwave activity slows down when you start to pray and 
to, what we call alpha. Are you familiar with that?
Yeah.
Okay, good. Then it drops down into theta and into delta and just continues 
to slow down. So when you go into the prayer or the meditative state of 
mind to communicate with God, your brainwave activity slows down so that 
you don’t have so much outside interference so you can have that 
communion. Isn’t that what it’s all about?
Yes.
It sure is. Okay. So what I’m going to do is I’m going to share with you 
exactly how that works, from my point of view. We’re not going to talk to 
God. I’ll leave that between you and him, but I’ll show you just how to still 
your mind in the same way. How’s that?
Sure.

Very cool. So do you see what I’m doing right there? I’m just going into his 
reality and using his reality, instead of trying to impose what I think I know 
on him because that would be very arrogant on my part, and I don’t want to 
be arrogant. Arrogance is for the inexperienced lay hypnotist that has a lot 
of needs that need to be met by a qualified professional trained, competent 
hypnotherapist.  
All right, thank you very much. Give him a round of applause. Make him feel 
good.
Applause
So like with the scientists, you just meet them on their level. You don’t have 
to be bigger or smarter or anything. You try to understand where they’re 
coming from, and when you do that, when you take the time and spend the 
time and then it’s kind of like, okay, I can relate to that. Cool. 
So just ahead and close your eyes, and go into that same space of 
communion. As you do you’ll find yourself relaxing down comfortably. Just 
like that, and that feels good. Doesn’t it? 
With the scientists, you are going to do the same thing. They may wonder, 
how do I quiet my mind down? They’re very logical thinkers, and so with 
them, they may spend a little bit more time. I had an individual, a friend of 
mine years ago, and he was a professor. He taught at UCLA. He spoke 24 
languages. He was a smart guy. In fact, he interpreted the sand scripts into 
English. He was an amazing guy. 
He used to teach on this boat called ‘The University of The Pacific’. It was 
this college. You get on this boat and go around the seven seas in this 
university, very smart guy. He had a very smart wife. I used to play tennis 
with her because I couldn’t talk to him because his mind was so active. It 
was crazy. But he was a very brilliant guy and I loved being around him, but 
I enjoyed playing tennis more.
He wanted to be hypnotized because he was doing some research on past 
life regression. So he wanted to do some work with me. My approach with 
him was exactly the same way as I’m doing here. 
Let’s go into that mind of yours that knows all these languages and has all 
these skills. That already knows how to get where you need to be because 
you know how to study, you know how to pull things apart, and as you pull 
those things apart, you know how to bring yourself to that place where you 
can relax. 
You can drop down into that place that you need to be in order to discover 
what past lives really means. It didn’t mean anything to me, but to him it did.

When you’re doing your stage show and you end up kicking some people 
off, could you talk about that a little bit more? What you’re looking for when 
you end up kicking people off of your stage?
Or, is the question, what am I looking for when I want to keep people on 
stage?
I guess you can go with that too.
It’s easy. What I’m looking for are people on stage who are very highly 
responsive to every suggestion that I give them. So if I’m doing a 
suggestibility test and they’re not responding, I’m just going to take them 
and send them off the stage. All I’m looking for are people who want to 
have fun. When people come to my show, I look at it like this. Party time, 
man, if they can’t keep up with my party, they’re not going to be up here on 
my stage.
That’s the way I approach it. I want people who are going to have a good 
time. If I don’t think they’re having a good time up here with me, I’ll send 
them out there, and they can watch everybody else up here having a good 
time. Does that help?
Yeah, I was just thinking about it in terms of changing color, changing 
breathing and that kind of stuff.
Changing color or changing breathing?
Skin colors, skin tone, a change in breathing and those kind of signs that…
Oh, you’re talking about the signs of hypnosis?
Right.
Yeah, the waxy skin, eyes fluttering and all that kind of stuff. I don’t pay 
attention to that when I’m doing a stage show because it’s a whole different 
dynamic than if you’re working with somebody doing one-on-one type 
trances.
I may notice that when I’m doing street hypnosis. I might look for that. When 
I’m doing a stage show, it’s a different dynamic. It really is. So I don’t pay 
too much attention to that. All I want to know is that if I give them a 
suggestion, they’re going to respond. If they don’t, then they’re off my 
stage. I don’t have to worry about if they have this hypnotic mask across 
their face and their eyes are fluttering, and they’re drooling or whatever. 

432
I look for people first of all that are going to comply with what I say when 
they come up here. When they do the suggestibility tests and when I begin 
to relax them, I want to make sure that they’re just flopped down and they’re 
completely gone. I’ll walk behind people or I’ll notice them as I walk in front 
of them. If I’m doing this and they’re still sitting there relaxed, and if I go up 
and go, relax and they’re like this, then I’m going to go, all right, I know who 
I’ve got to get rid of. It’s this goofball here. He won’t relax. 
I always want to make sure a person is completely like a rag doll. Those are 
the people I want because they’re going to be very good subjects because 
we want to have fun. 
I saw a thing, Joe Kind, one time because I was going to go do a demo for 
the Lion’s Club during a lunch hour, just do kind of a demo and explanation 
of hypnosis and that kind of thing. He had a tip about a tip, which was when 
you get there, go ahead and kind of like gain sympathy with the crowd. Like 
hey, I’m kind of new at this. I haven’t been doing this a long time, but I know 
what I’m doing. In other words, a way to get the crowd on your side, almost 
right out of the gate what do you think of that?
What do you think of it?
Well, it’s not real great as it sounds, but it’s not a bad idea. 
Try it out and see how you like it. Personally, for me, I go out there and I 
want to command my audience right away. When I go up on stage, I want 
to command everything. I want to control it. When I go into a room, it’s my 
room and nobody else’s. I don’t want them to feel sorry. I don’t want to get 
sympathy. I want them to do what I say, or I’m going to kick some butt, in a 
good way. 
I mean that’s part of the presence I think and part of the fun of it. You can 
go out there and you can have a lot of fun, but if you go out there and start 
being too loopy-loop, you’re going to lose a lot of people and you’re going to 
lose a lot of credibility because, after all, you are the hypnotist. People look 
at you as the hypnotist, the one who can make them do anything. You are 
in control of all things. You control the wind, the air, the water, the soil, fire! 
It’s true. They have these ideas in their minds. So I just exaggerate them 
because it’s what you want. You want people to have fun and do this stuff. 
Once you have their command and they start doing this, then I say, loosen 
up and after these people are hypnotized, forget about all that other stuff. 
Let’s have some fun now, that’s another way you can approach it, right out 
of the gate; I’d be a serious person.

Kind of related to what he was saying, I think what he was trying to get is 
like self-deprecating humor. I saw a hypnosis show where I think the guy 
was almost as much a stand-up comedian as he was a hypnotist. He kind 
of set the bar high at being really funny, and just his commentary during the 
show had people laughing really hard, and a lot of it was his own self-
deprecating humor on himself. It made it funny. 
What’s your opinion about being – I know you said you don’t do stand-up 
comedy, but you have to be somewhat funny and entertaining. You can’t 
just give orders. That seems kind of dry. So what’s your opinion on how to 
interlace comedy?
Let me just ask a question. Have I been giving orders? Is there anything 
funny about what I’ve been doing here today?
Yes.
Yeah. I use a lot of self-deprecating humor when I do a stage show. I go out 
there and I command and I have a lot of fun, but I get to the point where I 
let people just start screwing with me. That’s why I send people out into the 
audience and they start yelling at me and screaming at me and telling me 
I’m no good. They say things like, oh you got hands like a woman. Look at 
you. Why don’t you cut your hair, you old hippie. You suck! The audience 
loves it. I don’t care. I like it and I think that it endears you to the audience 
too because, there again, I’m just a human. 
I come out there and I’m being the hypnotist, but at some point its like, I let 
them beat the hell out of me. I like that. I get a kick out of it. If you have a 
fear of people making fun of you, do not go into this business.
Laughter
Enjoy it because they will. Just take it with a grain of salt. Look at me. I’m a 
short guy and sometimes my hair was long, now it’s short again – some of 
you think it’s long. You don’t think it’s short? Well, you’ve seen me with long 
hair. You’re the man. My hair was down to here before I cut it, guys. So I’ve 
cut my hair to comply with society. 
I actually cut it all off almost and I was like, wow, I couldn’t do it because it 
wasn’t me. It was not me. So, whether it’s your hair or your appearance, 
you’ve got to find your own style. 
So I’ll talk about style for a few minutes because we’re almost out of time. 
When you’re doing your style, find a style that is uniquely you. Don’t try to 
be anybody else. Be yourself. Be your most unique, comfortable self. That’s 
all I can say about that. Be your own unique, comfortable human being self. 

434
It doesn’t mean to look like a slob because you want to look good out there, 
but be yourself. 
Dress up nice. Look cool. Look nice. Look sharp. Stand out from the rest of 
the people in the room. They’re coming to see you because you’re a 
hypnotist, because you’re an entertainer, you’re a performer and you’re 
unique in your approach. So develop those skills. Look at other entertainers 
and other performers. Look at what they do, how they dress, how they act, 
how they think, how they talk, how they smell or whatever it is you need to 
do, and begin to take that on. 
The best way to become like somebody else is how? Oh my God. Don’t we 
have people in here that know NLP?
Model.
Model. Thank you. Yes. The best way to become successful is to model 
somebody else who’s already doing it. Find somebody who’s doing what 
you want to do. Check it out. Find out what they’re doing and be like them.
With that said, we will see you after the break, with Mr. Igor. Give him a 
round of applause. He’s back.

1-Minute Shows
How are you doing today? 
Good.
Now that’s what I like to hear. Who slept well last night? A little bit tired, 
perhaps? 
Yes.
You can see why we call it the boot camp, right? So who’s feeling like 
they’re a proper hypnotist now? Good because tomorrow you’re going to 
show us. We’re going to do the show. Rest assured today we’re going to be 
focusing very hard on making sure that you’re ready to do that show. You’re 
going to do a great job. 
One of the things we’re going to be doing is we’re going to make it easy for 
you to do a short show in a short amount of time so you feel like you have 
all the time in the world. Wouldn’t that be something? 
I don’t know about you guys, but who drives a car here? Remember the first 
time you were on a freeway. I remember the first time I went on the 
motorway, which is the equivalent in the U.K. Everything was zooming past 
me 100 mph, and I’m going like an old lady. I hated going on the motorway 
because of that. 
Then one day I decided, you know what? I’m a hypnotist. I should feel the 
changes. So I go on the motorway and I go straight for the fast lane, which 
was a little risky for me. Don’t do this at home, kids. I was just talking to 
myself – okay, you’re cool, calm and confident. 
Eventually, what happened was – because you’re in the fast lane anyway, 
so no one really comes in and out because it’s just one lane. So you’re kind 
of climatized, right? The strangest thing happened. I was going to a course 
at the time, so I was driving for like an hour and a half each day there and 
back. 
Maybe it was the second or third trip, something like that, and I suddenly 
realized that where I was coming off the motorway, off the freeway to the 

436
regular roads and back to regular speeds, everyone was like crawling 
along. 
It was like oh man, come on. I was like one of those really annoying drivers, 
beeping at everyone, yelling get out of the way and changing lanes four 
times just to ahead of one car, right? They were all going way too slow for 
me. 
That’s kind of what I’d like to do with you guys today if that’s okay with you. 
I’d like to speed up your brains, so when we end up doing a five-minute 
show that seems tediously slow to you, but perfectly paced to the rest of the 
world. Would that be something worth doing?
Yes.
What I want to do first, is just grab your chairs and put yourselves into your 
12 groups, the ones we organized yesterday. Go and do that now, and then 
we’ll start.
So let’s double check, has everyone got a group of three people? Yes?
Yes.
Are we good? All right. Excellent! You are going to love this, and hate me of 
course. Do you remember the seven-step little mini formula that we did in 
terms of a show?
1. Your Intro
2. Your call for volunteers
3. A quick test
4. An induction
5. The Big Band
6. One main routine
7. Finishing up
Do you remember all that? You may want to stand up. Actually, you can sit 
down if you want for this. Just get into groups of three and get nice and tight 
because you’re going to need it. Make sure you get nice and tight. Agree 
who is going to be the hypnotist first, second and third because you’re all 
going to be taking turns.
Please let me know when you know who’s going to be first, second and 
third. One of you needs to be sitting in front because you’ll be the hypnotist 
– or standing in front. 
All right, folks. Are you all ready? Let’s have the first hypnotists up and 
ready. Here’s what we’re going to do. There will be no music for this and 
you’ll see why in a moment, because it might get confusing. In your groups 
Students:

437
of three, you now have one minute, 60 seconds, to do an entire show from 
start to finish. 
That means there is not a single moment to waste. No wasted words, no 
wasted action. You have to get in there, do your thing and get out because 
when 60 seconds are up, the next person is up and I am not waiting. You’ll 
be eating up their time. Does that make sense?
Yes.
Are you guys ready? Don’t worry about timing. You have these seven steps 
to finish within 60 seconds:
1. Your Introduction
2. Your call for volunteers
3. Test for the rest of the group
4. Induction with everyone
5. Big Bandstand for a while
6. One simple main routine, an individual routine
7. Finish up. Bring them back and cancel all suggestions
So there’s no music.
There will be no music because that will confuse you at this point. All right, 
is everyone ready for this? Is everyone ready for this?
Yes!
All right, let’s go. Time starts now!

In a minute, we’ll do the same exercise we did yesterday, only this time you 
have a bigger group. You have a proper little stage show going on here, 
right? You’re going to come in, you’re going to introduce yourself, you’re 
going to allow volunteers to come on stage, you’re going to do a test and 
get more volunteers and you’re going to put inductions on the four people 
you’ve got as volunteers.
Then, if you want to get rid of some people because you don’t like them, 
send them back. So take more people than you want. Then you’ll do the Big 
Band, remember the playing instruments thing. Then you’ll do one other 
simple routine – forget their name, change name, alien language or 
whatever else you want to do and then we’re going to end, all within five 
minutes.
We’ll be cueing the music. Guys, you just did a show in one minute. Come 
on. This will seem like forever now. You’re doing exactly what you just did 
only you have five times as much time. It’s easy. And you’ve got the board 
right here to help you. And we’ve got the music right there to help you. This 
is a no brainer. 
Are you guys ready? 
Yes.
All right, folks. Your time starts now!
And that’s it, folks. That’s everything. Give yourselves a round of applause.
Applause
How do you guys feel? 
Great.
Who feels like a real stage hypnotist now? By the way, we promise you’ll be 
doing one show in Vegas. Actually, you’re doing repeat performances you 
realize that, right?
Okay you guys. We’ve run over a little bit but, hopefully, it was worth it for 
you guys. You had a good experience of a show. What we’re going to do 
now is for the next part of the afternoon, it’s going to be relatively 
straightforward. You should still have plenty of energy because we don’t be 
doing that much, in terms of content and in terms of performance. 

439
We’ll come back and we’ll start designing the show that you will be doing on 
Sunday, tomorrow. So we’ll come back and we’ll show you step-by-step 
how to design your show. If you want to use what you just did now as a 
template, that’s fine. If you want to actually go into some of the stuff, that’s 
fine too. I’ve seen a lot of you guys starting to invent inductions, invent 
suggestion tests and invent skits. That’s perfect. That’s exactly where you 
need to be. 
I’m very proud of you all. I hope you’re proud of yourselves. Let’s just take a 
15-minute break. Be back here in 10 minutes because there’s a lot of other 
content we’re going to cover, and we don’t want to be sliding too much on 
the time. All right, folks? Have a good day!
Applause
All right, folks. How are you doing?
Great.
Are we spreading further back. There seems to be a few empty chairs here. 
Everyone else is like, no there’s nobody hiding in the toilet. Oh my God, it’s 
getting to crunch time. How are you guys doing?
Great.
Are you learning some stuff.
Yes!
Doesn’t Don really know his stuff when it comes to stage hypnosis? The 
whole business and the back end? I think it’s important for you to realize 
this, because it would be unfair of us to give you a stage hypnosis course 
and promise you all these great riches are possible – which by the way, 
they are. 
But, it would be unfair to do that without giving you a solid understanding of 
just how much effort you have to do in the background to set it up in the first 
place. It won’t just fall in your lap. Some people will be lucky. Maybe your 
area just happens to be the place that has just been waiting for it, but for 
most of us, you’ll have to go out there and promote yourself. You’ll have to 
create a business out of this. 
There is a lot of business stuff involved. Hopefully, you found that talking 
about all the back end stuff, the safety stuff, what to do if someone freaks 
out on stage stuff, the setup stuff and really just the business element of it 
have all been worthwhile.

The Promo Show
Igor:
What I want to do now is have a look at the anatomy of a stage show, so 
you can actually start preparing your own show. You’re going to have nine 
minutes to do a show. Let me warn you here, at nine minutes and one 
second, the following thing is going to happen. At nine minutes and one 
second, the next hypnotist that’s waiting in the wings will be pushed on, and 
if you haven’t finished yet, he will finish your show for you and start his own.
So you really need to keep track of time. The only reason I’m saying this is 
most of you guys were easy. I mean you did a five-minute show with no 
problem at all. Some of you got your 30-second warning and what did you 
do then? Okay, now let’s do one more skit, quickly. 
When you get your 30-second warning – actually, it will be a one-minute 
warning. We’ll talk about that in a second. When you get your one-minute 
warning, what you’re looking to do is not start something new, but finish 
whatever is happening right now as elegantly as possible so you then can 
clear their minds and send them back to their chairs. 
If your show is only eight minutes long, you’re not going to fired by anyone. 
It’s perfect. Even if your show is just seven and a half minutes, it’s still fine. 
It’s just that if your show is nine minutes and one second, then someone 
else will be coming up here to finish it for you. You really don’t want that to 
happen, right?
So to avoid that happening, here’s what we’re going to do. Can I get rid of 
this page? Okay. You’re going to have nine minutes of show. So what we’re 
going to be doing is for eight minutes we’re going to pretty much leave you 
alone. You can have whatever music you want and so on. We’ll talk about 
the logistics of that in a moment.
At the end of the eighth minute, Mark over here has a very bright flashlight, 
an led light. Don’t worry, he won’t be lighting you unless you are ignoring 
the whole warning thing. Then like the last 30 seconds he’ll blind you with 
the light. We might have to resort to that. Really, all we’re going to be doing 
is just imagine the room is kind of soft low lighting. You can’t really see the 
back of the room or the exit very well because the lighting is relatively low.
Then if somewhere during your show this bright light just jumps up at the 
back of the room behind the camera, so it won’t disturb your promo video, if 
a bright light lights up and you see it, don’t go what the hell is that? I don’t 
know, let’s ignore it. That is your one-minute warning.

Here’s my strong recommendation. Whether you follow it or not is entirely 
up to you. I strongly recommend that when that flashlight goes on, whatever 
you’re doing find a way of elegantly finishing it up. The simplest way is just 
say that’s right, now sit down and sleep! Then start clearing the suggestions 
and bring them back. That way you have a nice thunderous applause at the
end of your promo DVD as well, which is a good thing. Send them back into 
the audience with thunderous applause. That is what I recommend you do. 
That will be the drill to go for, that way you’ll be assured to have a very 
clean and very professional looking show for the DVD. Just to emphasize 
this so there’s no misunderstanding on the day, at nine minutes and one 
second, someone else will come up and will finish the show for you. If you 
don’t want that to happen, well, you know what to do.
Are we okay with this? The reason I’m saying this – I don’t want to be a 
time Nazi on this, but if we don’t do this, there are a lot of people in this 
room and we’ll be here until 10:00 p.m. It’s very easy to start running over, 
and we just can’t afford to do that, partly because at 10:00 p.m., there’s 
going to be no motivation left in the crowd to have a good video for whoever 
is at the end of the day. That’s unfair to the people who are at the end of the 
day. Make sense?
Does that mean by nine minutes, everybody should be off the stage for the 
next one to start?
That’s what we’re aiming for all right?
That’s everybody off the stage?
Somewhere between the eighth or ninth minute, I want the show to finish 
and be going back. If you’re finishing right on the second of nine minutes, 
and they’re starting to move off at that point, we’re not going to stop the 
show and yell, you cheated! You’ll have a little bit of slush time, but it’s 
literally, in the second’s category, rather than the minutes. 
So your aim should be between minutes eight and nine to wrap up what 
you’re doing, dehypnotize your subjects, send them back into the audience 
with a thunderous applause, take your bow and, if you can do so, walk off 
all within that 60-second segment. 
It’s not tricky to do. I mean you guys have done five-minute shows already. 
So you can do it pretty well. In fact, I saw a few of you sneaking it in 
because when the music went off, you went oh bugger. All right, quick, 
sleep! Suggestions leave. Get out!
Would it be a recommendation to maybe shoot for seven minutes and get 
off early.

Sure. We’ll talk about timings in a second when we go through the anatomy 
of a stage show, and we’ll help you plan that timing so you don’t run over. 
Let’s put it this way, if your show is five minutes and you finish up on the 
sixth minute, you still have a really good promo tape, right? If it’s seven 
minutes, that’s fine too. It’s just that at the eight minute market, when you 
see that light basically, then you go, okay I’ve had my eight minutes. I’ll just 
gracefully bow out and finish it up.
A minute is more than enough time to finish a show. It’s more than enough 
time, so you shouldn’t feel time pressured. Just make sure you see that 
light. Look for it, and when it comes, you go, okay, time’s up. Whatever plan 
I had in my head is out the window now. I’m just going to finish the show.
Won’t the music be kind of a cue where we’re at in the show?
We’ll talk about the music as well, and rest assured, somewhere between 
the eight and nine minute mark, whatever music you’re playing will be 
turned off and we’ll have the exit music. That will be the other cue. Like the 
last 30 seconds is, basically, finishing up music.
Are you guys cool so far?

Let’s start breaking down the anatomy of a stage show purely and simply so 
you know how to put together what you’ll be doing tomorrow. Let me just 
keep an eye on the time here so we don’t run over too much for you guys. 
Okay, good.
So, you basically, did all of this today already. Do you remember how to do 
an Intro? Let me try this again. Who knows how to do an Intro?
Yes!
Do you know how to call for volunteers?
Yes!
Do you know how to test the rest of your audience for more volunteers?
Yes!
Do you know how to do a quick induction. I mean a quick induction?
Yes!
Do you know how to do a warm-up, like the band or the drunk or anything 
like that?
Yes!
Do you know how to do a main routine, like forgetting a name or speaking 
in an alien tongue or anything like that?
Yes!
Do you know how to end a show, clear the suggestions and send them 
back to the audience to thunderous applause?
Yes!
You know how to do a show in that case. I think so.
Applause
So let’s break this down in terms of times because time is of the essence 
when we’re coming to the show. Here’s my recommendation. You do not 

445
have to follow this. If you want, you can spend eight minutes putting 
someone in trance and one minute sending them back, if you want. I don’t 
recommend it. It’s not going to make much of a show, but you can do it.
What I recommend you do is you spend:
Three minutes to do your setup. 
I mean three minutes on your Introduction, your call for volunteers, your 
testing of the rest of the audience for more volunteers and your induction.
If you can keep this whole section in three minutes or less, you’re in great 
shape because now you have five minutes to do a show. Does that make 
sense? You could do this in two minutes, in which case more power to you. 
Then you have six minutes to do a show. Do you see how that works?
Let’s assume you take three minutes to do the whole Intro section. Then 
you have:
Five minutes to do the show.
One minute to finish the show.
Just so you realize the Intro is also part of your show, right? People will be 
excited by this whole section. It’s part of the mystique. I’m just talking in 
terms of, shall we say, trade lingo, this is the actual bit you get paid for. 
You did an entire show from beginning to end in five minutes, right? Most of 
you did one warm-up routine and maybe one or two main routines in that 
time isn’t that right including, of course, all the setup and so on. So what I 
recommend you think about doing in this section here, which is your five-
minute section, is keep it to about three or four routines tops. 
In other words, you want to do two warm-ups, like getting drunk at the 
beach and then maybe follow that up with the band. Then do one, shall we 
say, longer routine, which is like the main routine, like forgetting a name or 
something like that. That’s pretty much it. 
If you’re racing through one of these because you’ll be in control of your 
time at this point and you might find yourself having done two warm-ups 
within a minute, so you still have four minutes left and you have some time 
to play, have two or three main routines open to you. 
Aim to do one warm-up and two main routines or two warm-ups and one 
main routine. Then have two or three main routines in the back of your mind 
as extras that you’ll just throw in there if you feel like it. Does that make 
sense? 

446
Student:
Igor:
I don’t even know why I’m asking this question. I’m sure you’re going to 
cover it, but how are they going to know back there if we get done with the 
session quicker, faster?
Very simple. You’ll do something like this. It’s a very subtle hypnotic trick. 
What you’ll be doing is this; we’re going to have three people in your show; 
two people supporting you. There will be people in your group. You’ll be 
choosing them very shortly. So in your group of six people, you might just 
split into two groups of three and play it that way if you want, or whatever 
you want to do. I don’t mind. 
You’re going to have one stage manager. You’re going to have one DJ. 
You’re going to have one hypnotist. Of course, your roles will rotate as we 
go through the shows. 
Your stage manager’s job is to do two simple things:
1. Make sure you’re standing in the wings ready to go on stage two 
minutes before your show begins.
So, when you see that light in the background, your stage manager should 
be going, where the hell is my hypnotist? You should be grabbing him and 
saying, it’s your turn to be here. As a stage manager, you must know when 
your hypnotist is coming on stage because it’s your job to keep him ready to 
go on stage. 
Does that make sense? Of course, hypnotists, it’s in your best interest to be 
ready too. 
2. The stage manager’s role is to introduce the hypnotist.
Remember, we talked about this just a moment ago with Arthur? He’ll be off 
stage with a mic in his hand and he’ll say, ladies and gentlemen, please 
welcome the world’s most amazing hypnotist, Arthur. Does that make 
sense?
So the stage manager will make sure you get on and do the whole show 
and so on. Meanwhile, the next stage manager is cueing up and the next 
hypnotist, etc.
The DJ will be in the back of the room with a little iPod. We’ve cued up all 
the music and, as the hypnotist, you will have discussed with the DJ ahead 
of time, here are the five skits I have in mind. I want to do these three for 
sure, and maybe I’ll do these two as well. Here are the numbers of the 
music I want to go with them. You have the musical sheet with them right 
now, the white one. Is this one here? Thank you very much.

447
You will notice that the sheet has the names of skits and a number. The DJ 
will only work with the numbers because the names on the actual sound 
tracks are different from the names of the skits. We haven’t renamed them, 
but the numbers are the same. 
So what you do is, let’s say you want to use getting drunk as your warm-up; 
you want to use the World’s Sexiest Spy as your main routine; and you 
want to use The Hottest Disco Dancer as another main routine, all right? 
Number three, by the way, is the Luckiest Day in the World, which is what I 
recommend you use as your general holding music. 
It’s the music you’re playing in the background, while nothing else is going 
on. Like when you come on stage that will be playing. When your 
volunteers are coming up, that will be playing; if you have a routine that 
hasn’t got any music for it, that will be playing in the background. You’ll 
recognize it because you’ve been hearing it all day.
So you’ll come on stage and number three is playing. So the DJ has 
number three on his list. Then, the next time you point at him – or you might 
even do a little finger signal or something like that. Just go three or five or 
whatever it is. He’ll start playing getting drunk. So you’re on stage, you’re 
doing your demo, you’ll want number seven, which is the hypnotic induction 
music that’s the music you’ll play during the induction. 
Please come up on stage. Everyone goes yay. Then everyone sleep- sleep-
sleep- sleep, sleep. Number seven starts playing. You do your induction, 
which means you’ll go right back to either the basic music, if you want that, 
or let’s say you’re going to be doing Big Bandstand or because his list will 
have number 5 written on it, you’ll go to number 5 and start playing that. 
When you’ve had enough of this, then you’ll go like this, or you’ll just pause 
and put them back to sleep. Then you’ll do a skit, maybe without music or 
maybe with just the background music. Then when you have another skit, 
like The Hottest Disco Dancer, so you’ll hold up however many fingers, and 
they’ll start playing the music, you’ll do your thing and then you’re done.
Here’s how I recommend you do this:
Track 3 is for general music. 
It’s just a happy, vibrant upbeat tune, and you’ve all had a chance to listen 
to this at lunch. This is Track 3. You should be familiar with this by now. 
You’ve been hearing it a lot. I recommend you use this as your general 
background track when there’s no other music going on. Even it’s just very 
quiet, it sets a little bit of atmosphere, rather than having silence.
Track 7 is your induction music.

448
Do you want to play number 7 briefly. It sounds like hypnotic music, right? 
So whether you play it for 30 seconds or for eight minutes, it’s up to you. 
Just remember, you only have eight minutes. 
After that, you just choose whichever sound tracks fit what you want. 
If you haven’t got a sound track yet that fits whatever skit you’re trying to 
do, then just go right back to the general music in the background as an 
atmospheric filler whilst you do whatever else you’re doing. 
If there is something specific, like A Day at the Races or anything like that, 
you just choose that. What they’ll be doing is they’ll have a list like this, and 
it will have 3, 7, 5, 4, 3 on it. So they’ll start with 3. Then you’ll say 7, they’ll 
play it and then you’ll do this again and he’ll play this one. You’ll do that 
again, and they’ll play this one. Then if you want to change, instead of 
having 3 at the end you’ve decided, you know what? I’m going to risk it, I 
now want to have a Big Stripper routine, then you’ll whisper, I want 16 and 
hope to God that he understands you. 
Of course, the easier way of doing it is to say to him, at this point, I may 
need number 4 or 5. So if I do this signal, do 4; if I do this signal, you’ll play 
5, or whatever. My advice though, is to keep it simple. Start with the general 
music, go to the induction, do one or two pieces of music that fit whatever 
skits you’re doing. Keep them in order. Just flow with it. 
If something comes up that you want to use that has nothing to do with this, 
just give a general signal, something like this, and make sure that your DJ 
knows that when you do this, you basically mean go back to the general 
music. So either they go through your list or they go to the general music. 
It’s a very simple way of keeping track of things. Does that make sense?
Thank you very much.
You’re very welcome. Can we have a microphone up front here? Please 
stand up a second to ask your question.
Are we going to have any kind of microphones? 
You will have a microphone. In fact, you’ll be wearing one like I’m wearing, 
and you’ll have one of those hand-helds as well to play with the audience if 
you want. Do not give it to your volunteers. Hold it for them. There will be 
another one for your manager to introduce you. In fact, chances are he’ll 
introduce you and then give it to you and you’ll walk on stage with it, that 
way we’ll keep track of the mics.
Number 20, the exit music– is that the one you’ve been playing for our one-
minute warning?

Igor:

Student:
Igor:
Yes. We can use the exit music for that if you want, or you can choose your 
own exit music. It’s entirely up to you. Let me just make this very clear. This 
is your show. You can do with it what you want. The only interference I’m 
going to provide is that at nine minutes and one second, someone else is 
coming up on that stage whether you like it or not. In between, honestly, if 
you want to stand there and strip, that’s your problem. I don’t care. You can 
do that. 
You can run your show exactly how you want. These are just suggestions 
to make it run more smoothly and more easily for you. Does that make 
sense?
If you want to have that music, use it. If you don’t, I’m totally fine with that 
too. We’ll come to you in a second. We have one up here first.
So you had said that everybody’s going to pick their DJ and their manager. 
So we all may be a DJ as well? 
Everyone will be a DJ. Everyone will be a manager. Rest assured what will 
happen is both Matt and his wife, Sherri, have been back there doing all the 
music for us during the whole event. So they’ll be sitting right by your side 
as the DJ. 
You don’t have to be a DJ if you don’t want to, but I strongly recommend 
that you do. Why? Because once you know what it feels like for a DJ to do 
your music, you’ll know how to train them when it comes to doing your 
show. 
You may as well have that experience and you’ll know what mistakes they 
can make because you might make them as well. But you’ll have either 
Matt or Sherri sitting by your side to coach you through the whole process, 
and that way you can coach someone else and train them to respond to 
your signals in real life too. 
Make sense?
Yes. Thanks.
I was just wondering what music you recommended during the main part, 
when you’re trying to have the people forget.
Again, you can use anything for the music. We’ll give you a list of sketches 
that fit that music specifically; however, if in doubt, if you don’t know what 
music will fit something, just go with number 3 – the general music.

450
This is your default that I would recommend. Can you play this one again, 
Matt, number three. This is the general music they can play in the 
background whenever you don’t have anything else to do it’s just that happy 
upbeat music. 
So if somebody is speaking in alien tongue, will they be able to hear it over 
that?
You can tell your DJ how loud you want it. Just tell them. I want it quiet. It’s 
your show. You’re in charge. 
For time’s sake, will there be more than the one-minute warning, or will it 
just be that? I mean in order for you to keep track of the time, will there 
be…
Oh, you want to have more than the one-minute warning? Is that what 
you’re saying?
Yeah, is that possible?
Sure. What we can do is make little signs up – I’m not sure how well they’ll 
be visible – but we can have little signs that say, you have five minutes left; 
three minutes left and then the light goes on. Would you like that?
Yes!
So we’ll just make sure that we have assistants in the back. The first three 
minutes we can ignore and then we’ll go 5, 4, 3, 2 lights on and you’re off. 
The big hook will come and drag you off the stage. All right, is everyone 
good?
Yes.
Is everyone happy?
Yes.
So there are couple of things we’ll be doing now. The first thing is we’re 
going to be going to a break in about 10 minutes or so. On your break, I 
want you to start chatting to people in your group who will be your manager, 
and who will be your DJ. Select that because after the break, we’re going to 
start putting together your own skit, your own show and starting to rehearse 
it. Does that make sense to you? 
Get together in your groups, maybe have your break together, go pee 
together, unless you want to hold hands, I don’t know. Your manager will do 
your introduction for you.

Wait a second. Don’t start doing this now. We’re not done yet. Find your 
manager, find your DJ and just make sure they agree with you. In the next 
session, you can pick your music, pick your routines and everyone knows 
what’s going on. 
Sperling, are you still with us? Sperling stay with us, stay with us. There you 
go. 
I assume that both the manager and the DJ should not be people who go 
just before you and just after you.
That would be very helpful. You know what order you’re in now, so you 
should be able to manage that relatively straightforwardly. Here’s what 
we’re going to do now. You understand the basic outline of a show, right?
Right.
You understand the very important timing that you’re going to be limited to. 
You have a sheet of music so you can choose music to follow the skits that 
you want.   
Right.
So what I recommend you do is when we break up in about 30 seconds 
time, find people in your group that you want to be your manager or your DJ 
and have dinner with them. Over dinner, I want you to start discussing how 
you want your show to run. Maybe just have dinner as a group and figure 
out who’s doing which role for whom. Then start throwing backwards and 
forwards ideas for what you want to do, how you want to run your show, 
what music might fit that and so on.
So when you come back after dinner you’ll have at least half a plan of what 
you want to do. Now here’s a hint. If you do not know what you want to do, 
if you’re like, I don’t know, this all could be possible, then make life easy 
and stick with that five-minute show you did earlier today, and just expand it 
a little bit. Just make a little bit more out of that. You have it under your belt 
already. You’ve already done it.
Otherwise, if you want to experiment with things and try new things out and 
so on, just do that. Does that make life easy for you guys?
Yes.
All right, let’s be back here at 7:20 to start at 7:30 on the dot. Sound good?
Yes!

1-Minute Rehearsals
Igor:
Believe it or not, your seminar, your course finishes today. The seminar will 
finish today in about an hour or so’s time because tomorrow, I don’t want 
you to turn up to these rooms as students. I want you to turn up as 
professional stage hypnotists who have been engaged to do a gig, and 
that’s exactly what you’re going to do because you will be. 
As far as I’m concerned, right now guys, you’ve passed. You’ve passed the 
course. You’ll get your certificates. Do you know why? Because I saw you 
do a show. I saw every one of you do a kick-off show in here earlier today. 
Sure, it was only five minutes, but it was a full blown show. 
Now I’m not going to suggest to you that it’s that easy when you go out in 
the real world because sometimes things come up, but the point is, that’s 
your basic pattern. If things start happening in the middle of it, well, you just 
deal with it and you get back to your basic pattern. This is easy to do, isn’t 
it?
You can do each of these steps, right? Hopefully, that gives you a lot of 
peace and comfort in terms of what you’ll be doing tomorrow because if 
anything else goes wrong, do you know what you do? You do exactly the 
same thing you did today. You go, oh I fumbled, ah sleep! All right, big 
band, and you’re done. 
So that’s always there in the back of your mind. We spent a lot of time 
drilling that in because you’ll always have a default to fall back on. Now the 
more experienced you get, the more shows you do you’ll be experimenting 
with different routines, you’ll get to like some routines and so on. Great! 
Then your defaults become larger and larger until eventually you can pretty 
much handle any situation without thinking about it.
You’re not there yet. You need some experience for that. So what I’d like to 
do today is get yourselves into groups of three. Most of you are in a group 
of six, so just take the group and split yourself in half. Those of you who 
have a group of five – where’s the group of five again? If you guys grab 
Debra in the back here and so you’ll have one group of three and a group of 
two. Just grab Debra as the third person. 
What I want you to do is just run through this structure using your own 
show, whatever routines you’re thinking of. Make sense? We’re going to do 
it in a couple of ways. The first way we’re going to do it is just a one-minute 
version of whatever show you had in mind, a one-minute version. Why? 
We’re going to just do a couple of those cycles, just so you get the 
connections between things together. 

453
Then you’ll get an opportunity to do the whole show in its full nine-minute 
length so you can test yourself in terms of how the timing flows. That’s 
pretty much the rest of the day. 
So you’ll first get your show under your belts, so you understand who it 
flows. Then you’ll test yourself for times, making sure that no one else 
comes and steals the show from you at the end of it. Then, we’re good to 
go, aren’t we? Is there anything else that’s really left over? 
When you say do the show in one minute, what words are you referring to?
I’m talking about the whole thing. You’ll try to do the show in one minute. 
You’re going to do the whole lot in one minute. It means either you become 
a very fast talker, or you cut out all that stuff that you really don’t need. Your 
induction will be an instant one. Your warm-up routine will be for 10 
seconds. Your main routine will be for 10 seconds. Your Introduction will be 
five seconds, if that. This little test here will not take more than 10 seconds. 
Now, of course since it’s just a minute, your partners will be play acting 
along with you just to give you the feel for it. The important thing is that you 
get the experience of your show all the way through so you know how it fits 
together. Make sense? Then we’ll do it together as a longer piece to get the 
feel of the time. 
Can we run the music and get trained on the equipment?
The simple answer is no. I don’t mean to be flippant about it. It’s just 
because we have one iPod and there are 80 of you.
If the person is doing their spot where they’re explaining instructions and 
talking to people while they’re sitting down, if the music is too loud, are the 
sound people going to take it down a bit so they can hear them or is it going 
to be a steady volume?
That’s your call as a hypnotist. You tell your DJ how loud you want it. Just 
get some signals. I would recommend you just have three basic signals. 
1. Next track.
2. Whatever you’re doing, stop it or go to the default track, which in my 
opinion should be number three.
3. Make it louder or make it quieter. 
They’re not really crazy signals, are they? They’re very simple ones, like 
bring it up a little bit, bring it down a little bit, go to the default track or kill the

track or just go to the next track. It’s simple and everyone knows what 
they’re doing. All right? Is everyone cool? 
Yes.
Any questions? All right, please split into your 12 groups. When you’re 
ready, please look at me so we can start you off on your timings. 
Now once you’re in your group of six, please split into two groups of three 
inside that group, but stay close together just because we’re on the same 
space in a minute. So you guys all in groups of three now, yes?
Yes.
All right. In your group of three, please name yourselves off 1, 2 and 3 all 
right. Do all of you have a hypnotic number – 1, 2 or 3. Yes? 
Yes.
So you all know what turn you’re taking, right?
Yes.
Okay, I’d like to have hypnotist number 1 up in front of the other two. Get 
ready to rock and roll. Okay, hypnotist number 1, your minute starts now!

Show Confidence
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
So the first question is who feels like they know their show much better 
now? Who feels like they’re completely lost at sea? A couple of you are lost 
at sea? If you feel at this stage that your show is maybe a little bit more 
complex than you had originally thought, here’s my advice. Simplify it. 
What’s the easiest way to simplify it? Go back to what you know. 
Remember, this is only your first show. This is not how you’ll be doing the 
rest of the shows in your life. 
You want your first show just to be like, I’m going to go out there and do it 
and it’s done. It’s as simple as that. Now if on the day, you get inspired to 
try something different, great. You just give them the signal for general 
music, and you do something different. At least you’ll have a default to fall 
back on. Doesn’t that make sense to you guys?
So, those of you who’ve got a good feel for the show you’ve decided, that’s 
excellent. Those of you who do not, my strong recommendation is simplify 
it. Go with what you did earlier today. I saw you guys – I saw you, for 
example, do a fantastic show earlier. Yes, you young man. You thought you 
were doing what everyone else was doing, but you weren’t. You were doing 
some crazy stuff, and it was fun.   
The reason you might feel that you don’t know your show is purely and 
simply because you’re putting way too much pressure on yourselves. So 
here’s the most important lesson you might take away from the entire 
seminar. Are you ready for this? STOP IT! Just stop doing it. Just make it 
easy. 
For most people, when they see a show, a bad hypnotist is better than most 
good shows. Let me repeat that. Seeing a bad stage hypnotist for most 
everyday people is more exciting than seeing a great show somewhere 
else. So why make life hard for yourself? Go right back. Simplify it. 
Has everyone done a five-minute show today that they thought was easy to 
do, yes?
Yes.
What’s wrong with that? Once you can do a five-minute show, if you get 
inspired to try something else, great. If not, you know what? Even if you just 
do a five-minute show tomorrow, no one’s going to come up and shoot you, 
believe it or not. So, do a five-minute show, you’ll have a five-minute promo 
that looks great and that gives you confidence to do the next show a little bit 
longer and a little bit more and so on.

456
Does that make sense to you guys? So those of you who kind of got a little 
bit lost with your little show just now – put your hands up if you got lost in 
your show but feel better now? Do you have something to do now? Put your 
hand up if you’re still completely lost at sea. All right, you will be shot. 
All right, here’s what we’re going to do now. Folks, here’s what we’re going 
to do now. In the same groups you’re in – in other words, the group of 
three, you’re going to go through your entire show using the whole nine 
minutes that you have available.
I’ll be there for you. Would you like me to give you a three-minute warning 
and after that at every minute? Is that good for you guys? I’m going to give 
you a three-minute warning. When I give you the three-minute warning that 
means you should have finished the induction. That means you have five 
minutes left for your show. I will then give you a minute warning each time 
one minute passes. 
At five minutes, four minutes, three minutes, two minutes and one minute. 
When you get to the one minute, I believe that will be at eight minutes. I’ll 
say, you’re now getting close to being done. I’ll give you a warning that says 
eight minutes is up, you now have one minute to finish your show. So I’ll 
give you the finishing up time. 
Whatever you’re doing – let me re-emphasize this. Even if you’re in the 
middle of a routine, I strongly recommend you break the routine as if you 
meant to or you spend five seconds going, that was funny, well done, sleep! 
Then start finishing the show there and then. Don’t try to take it to the edge 
because otherwise you’re risking someone coming up and finishing your 
show for you, and you don’t want that, do you?
Just to recap, I’ll give you a three-minute warning, which means three 
minutes are up. Then I’ll give you a minute warning for the next five 
minutes, which means eight minutes will be up.
Then as soon as the eight minutes are up, I’ll remind you this is your eight-
minute warning, which means you’ll have 60 seconds to wrap up your 
show. When I say all stop, that’s when someone’s going to come on the 
stage, so you had be off it by then. 
Make sense? Everyone cool? Does everyone know what they’re doing?
Yes.
You’re doing it with the same three people you did a moment ago so that 
we all have a chance to do this tonight. So number 1, you’re up. We’ll be 
using no music today. 
Students:
Igor:

457
Folks, one more thing, may I have your attention please? We will not be 
using music tonight other than the general music we will not be using music 
today other than the general music. 
However, if you’re going to be using music tomorrow, make sure you give 
your queues at the appropriate time and pretend there’s a DJ there, taking 
your instruction.
Change music, go to default music, lift the volume or lower the volume. You 
may as well get used to that process as part of the show. Make sense? This 
is an extra complication and you may as well practice it now. 
Does everyone know what they’re doing?  
The first three minutes, is that music set for the first three minutes?
No. You can have whatever music you want. You can have whatever music 
you want anywhere in the show tomorrow. You decide it. If you can’t think 
of anything, use the same music through the entire show, and just keep it 
looping. That just makes life easy. If you do want to change music, that’s 
fine. If you don’t, that’s fine too.
My recommendation is you use the basic music all the way up to the test. 
You use the induction music for the induction. Then for these things here, 
you’ll either use the basic music or whatever fits your sketch, and that’s 
written up in your music notes. 
Make sense? 
We lost a person.
You lost a person? Is he under your chair? Oh, he’s lost his voice. All right, 
in which case, Matt can you rejoin them in a minute when we start again? 
You’ll have the same assistants. Does everyone have a group of three to 
work with? Say again? All right, you’re in good shape, that’s fine. 
Otherwise, we’re going to start mixing groups, and we don’t want to do that. 
All right, folks any other points, questions or anything like that? 
Stage hypnotist number 1, you’re up.

Are you ready for this? Music please. Nine minutes. I will give you a three-

Final Words

Spencer:
We have the last few minutes of golden wisdom to share with you. First, 
how do you guys feel?
Great.
Go ahead and give yourselves a round of applause.
Applause
So a nine-minute show doesn’t seem so short after all, does it? It’s actually 
quite long, isn’t it? It will get easier as you have more fun up there as you 
get used to it. In the meantime, you could bill yourself as having the world’s 
fastest stage hypnosis show, literally. 
Literally, I am amazed at every one of you. This is awesome! 
You guys rock. 
I have a few things here that I want to add for you guys, if you guys want to 
have an awesome promo tomorrow. I want you to think about this. I want 
you to take these, into consideration. Before I do a show, this is what I do. 
But before I get to that, what I want to see as a promoter, if I’m looking at a 
video, is this. For you guys, I want to see a brief Introduction, which is going 
to happen for the stage manager. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands 
together for Shawn, the great hypnotist. You come up there and people are 
clapping. So they’re going to want to see that. 
Then they’re going to want to see a bit of an induction. Not so much the 
rapid, but they want to see people flopping over a little bit.
Then you can do some inductions and then we’ll have clips of the routine. 
This is what they want to see. 
At the end of it, they want to see a website, a web address, how to get a 
hold of you. They want contact information on there. 
At the beginning of the video, they’re going to want to see your name. Like 
mine is, Spencer the World’s Fastest Hypnotist. Then I go right into what 
I’m doing, and it ends up with my website and how to contact me. Take 
these into consider as you prepare for tomorrow.

460
The second thing is this. It’s very important. Get some sleep tonight. If you 
think you’re going to go out and party tonight and be fresh for tomorrow, 
you’re mistaken. This is Las Vegas so do yourself a favor, get some sleep 
tonight and be rested because tomorrow is going to be a long day, and you 
want to look your best. 
As far as looking your best, dress up tomorrow. Look like a stage hypnotist. 
Look good because first appearance is what’s going to sell you. If you don’t
have something on you or in your room now that is useable, they’ve got 
some great stores upstairs. Go spend the money and invest in yourself. 
You’ve got one chance for these guys to look at you, and trust me they’re 
going to be looking. 
For every one promo pack they get from you, they get 100 from other 
people. We are a dime a dozen, folks. First impressions last, so dress 
sharp.
No booze tonight because you’ll wake up groggy. If you’re hung over, 
you’re not going to be your best. Save the party for tomorrow night when 
we’re done and we go to the other shows. Save it for then. You’ll have 
much more fun. I can’t stress this enough. I know you want to go out and 
party. Save it for tomorrow in a big celebration. 
Caffeine, don’t do the caffeine either, here’s why. If you have a sore throat –
does anybody in here have a sore throat? Let me tell you what to do. When 
you wake up in the morning, take a nice hot shower and steam yourself. If 
you have a steamer in your room, put your head over it and get your lungs 
filled up and get your throat clear. Drink hot tea decaf only. No caffeine. You 
don’t want anything that’s going to stimulate your vocal chords. This is a 
performer’s secret. 
If you’ve got a bad throat, put some lemon in your hot tea and some honey. 
That will coat your throat and get rid of the sore throat. If you have a sore 
throat, bring a hot mug with you tomorrow full of juice with lemon in it and 
some tea.
If you have to get little bags of tea to bring with you because your throat 
hurts, bring them with you. Suck it down before you do your performance. 
That’s a very important thing to do. 
No dairy products. No citrus, nothing that will cause phlegm and cause your 
throat to lock up or your nose to drip because it will happen. I’m giving you 
tips, man. This is what you need to do. This is going to be a very, very big 
day for you tomorrow. It’s a very important day. Seriously, do your very 
best. 

461
Remember, if you don’t have your websites, get those taken care of so that 
you can get those to Mark so he can get those put on there.
One more thing that I encourage you to do – and there again, I want to 
strongly encourage you right now to pick up that CD for the mental 
programming for the stage hypnotist. If you want to do yourself a favor, 
begin to program yourself tonight and get yourself psyched up, ready and 
jacked up for tomorrow.
Listen to it tonight. Just plug it in and let it run two or three times. When you 
get up in the morning, play it again. I have been doing this day one. I listen 
to self-hypnosis tapes every single day. I’ve been a hypnotist for over 30 
years, doing this work for not that long but for quite a while, and I still listen 
to CDs every single day. If you go up to my room, I have an iPod and it’s 
loaded with MP3 self-hypnosis programs that I created for myself and other 
people.
I’m so used to my own voice, I drop. But I have a few of other people that I 
enjoy too. I even have one of his that I got for free. 
Free? There’s that word again. See, they’re on my side. 
But wait minute. You said sign up here, and you get a free one. 
Don’t remind me, okay? I’m having issues now as it is.
But I don’t listen to his as often as I listen to my own. 
They’re free too, aren’t they?
Yeah, they’re free too, but what can I say. So anyway, if you don’t have that 
program, do yourself a favor, get it and listen to it. Program your mind not 
just for tonight, but for the rest of your career. It will make a difference. 
Honestly. I still listen to self-hypnosis relaxation CDs. Mine, his and other 
people’s because they just make me feel good when I’m stressed and 
tensed out.

Take advantage of the technology. Use it. It’s there for a purpose. It’s to 
help you be on the top of your game. Tomorrow you need it. You need 
these ideas flowing and filtering through your mind, and you can do that 
best by relaxing into that moment.
That’s right.
Because it does happen naturally.
And it really doesn’t take a genius to work out.
It takes a very intelligent person.
How easy and natural it is…
To let go…
And trust…
The process…
of your unconscious…
Each time…
Now. 
Right now.
Developing its own rhythm.
And the things that you need to learn…
And trusting…
As you relax.
That you can breathe deeply…
As you go deeper and deeper…
And let go…

Do some suggestion experiments with the rest of the crowd…
And you will have fun with it…
More people coming up. The excitement building…
And it’s so easy to do…
You feel the thrill of excitement in the crowd…
Running through your veins…
And then you’re induction begins…
And you know how to do it…
So easy…
Effortlessly…
A trip to the beach…
There you go…
Drifting on a cloud…
Easily…
A golden sunshine…

Images flowing through your mind…
Time for the first warm-up routine…
There you go…
It’s so easy to do…
You know how to move…
When you do the Big Band…
You know how to breathe…
Drunk and stoned at the beach…
You watch the people…
Driving cars…
You know what to do…
What are you going to do?
Who will you choose?
Watch it now…
Why did you choose them?

It’s going to help you make this easy now…
It’s warm…
Three minutes in…

Like a bolt of electricity shining through everyone…
To the tip of your toes.
Standing on end.
There it is…
And there you are…

Already amazing things are happening…

I can’t believe you’re doing this…
will be with you for the rest of your life…
Where are you going?
Growing stronger…
Relax and 
Like a seed, growing into a tree…
Accepting all…
Healthy, vibrant…
And doesn’t that feel good?
And strong…
You are the one…
Natural.
The one you’ve been waiting for…
And now it’s time…
All your life…
For you to discover…
Are you ready?
That this is you.
Are you paying attention?
And not just on the inside…
Do pay attention.

It’s everything you do on the outside…
And there it is…
Because I think when these people realize who they really are, they’re in for 
a pleasant surprise. Don’t you think?
I think it’s a good time to think about that.
I think so. The best place to think about that, of course, is out there when 
you head back to your own rooms and have a good night’s rest. Be ready to 
get up nice and early tomorrow morning, remembering that the clocks 
change at midnight.
Spring forward.
So we’re starting at 9:00 a.m. on the dot. Be there at 8:30, which will be 
7:30 today’s time, I believe, if that’s right. 
That would be correct.
So be there waiting at 7:30 a.m. today’s time, which will be 8:30 a.m. 
tomorrow’s time, and we’ll be ready to start the show.

Now a couple of announcements, folks. 
1. I’d like you to give yourselves a big round of applause for having 
completed this course.
Applause
2. Recognize the hard work you put in. 
This has been a boot camp, hasn’t it?
Yes.
You have worked hard, have you not?
Yes.
We promised we’d push you, and have we pushed you?
Yes.
Did we deliver on every one of our promises?
Yes.
I’m glad to hear that because in the back of the room you will find 12 piles 
of certificates. They’re in the same order of the groups that you’re in. I 
recommend that you have one person pick up all the certificates for your 
group. When we head outside, you can just divide them amongst each 
other. 
Hopefully, the ones that have your name on it will be the ones you’ll take, 
but it’s up to you. Just as recognition for the hard work you’ve done. The 
only reason I’m going to ask you to ease your way out is because we’ve got 
to reset this whole room for tomorrow, and that’s going to take us few hours 
to do. So whatever you need to be doing, please move along and take care 
of that sort of stuff outside. 
Other than that, really, all I have to say is that as far as I’m concerned, this 
is the end of the seminar. The learning, as far as what we’re teaching you, 
is stopping here because you’re ready. These guys are ready to do their 
show, aren’t they?

Tomorrow is your day. You guys are fantastic. I am so impressed with 
everything that you guys have done. 
Just remember this, as Don said before, hypnotists are not a sideline act. 
They’re not a warm-up act. You are the main act. You’re the reason people 
come there for. Tomorrow you will be the reason why people will be sitting 
in this room. So have fun. Enjoy it. Be the star of the show, and don’t put 
any pressure on yourself. Keep it simple. You’ve done it dozens of times in 
here, and if your mind goes blank, just do what you’ve done in here and 
you’ll do a great job.
Does that make sense?
Yes.
Now the only thing I have left to say is go home!
Applause
