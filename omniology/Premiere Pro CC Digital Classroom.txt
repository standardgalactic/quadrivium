Locating missing media
5
Starting up
Copying the lesson fi les to your hard drive
1 
Insert the Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom DVD supplied with this book.
m
2 
On your computer desktop, navigate to the DVD and locate the folder named
prlessons.
3 
You can install all the fi les, or just specifi c lesson fi les. Do one of the following:
•
 Install all lesson fi les by dragging the prlessons folder to your hard drive.
•
 Install only some of the fi les by creating a new folder on your hard drive named 
prlessons. Open the prlessons folder on the supplied DVD, select the lesson you wish to
complete, and drag the folder(s) to the prlessons folder you created on your hard drive.
Locating missing media
Premiere Pro creates a link between your project fi les and the fi les that you import into 
the Project panel. This linkage system allows you to have a very small project fi le, but at
the same time requires that you manage the media you are using in your projects. If you 
move, rename, or delete fi les that you are using in a project you will receive a missing media
warning when Premiere Pro starts up. You should always locate any missing fi les before 
attempting to proceed with your project.
The process for locating missing fi les is automatic and will help you fi nd video, audio, still 
images, and even preview fi les.
1 
When presented with a fi le browser, verify the fi le name at the top of the dialog box. 
This is the fi le that you are currently trying to locate.
Premiere Pro requests that you locate any missing fi les at the time a project is opened.
2 
Navigate to the missing fi le, highlight it, and then press the Open button to relink the 
fi le. After locating all missing fi les, the project will open.

6
Working with the video tutorials
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
If your missing fi les are still in the same relative folder structure as when they were fi rst
imported into your project, then Premiere Pro should locate them all once it knows the
location of the fi rst one. If it cannot automatically fi nd other missing fi les, you will have to
locate them manually. Once all missing fi les have been found or skipped, the project will
open.
There are technically three options when attempting to locate missing fi les; you can fi nd the
fi le and open it, skip the specifi c fi le, or set the fi le as offl  ine. Offl  ine fi les can be brought 
online by right-clicking on them in the Project panel and choosing Link Media from the
menu that appears. In addition to the ability to skip and offl  ine individual fi les, you also have
buttons to skip and offl  ine all fi les the application is currently attempting to locate.
Unlocking Mac OS fi les
Mac users may need to unlock the fi les after they are copied from the accompanying disc. This 
applies only to Mac OS computers and is because the Mac OS may view fi les that are copied from
a DVD or CD as being locked for writing.
If you are a Mac OS user, and have diffi  culty saving over the existing fi les in this book, you can use 
these instructions so that you can update the lesson fi les as you work on them and also add new 
fi les to the lessons folder 
Note that you only need to follow these instructions if you are unable to save over the existing 
lesson fi les, or if you are unable to save fi les into the lesson folder.
1 After copying the fi les to your computer, click once to select the prlessons folder, then
choose File > Get Info from within the Finder (not Premiere Pro). 
2 In the aelessons info window, click the triangle to the left of Sharing and Permissions to
reveal the details of this section.
3 In the Sharing and Permissions section, click the lock icon ( ), if necessary, in the lower-
right corner so that you can make changes to the permissions.

Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of some of the concepts covered in
this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Understanding digital Non-Linear Editing
When you watch a video or fi lm, what you are actually watching is a series of still images 
displayed sequentially at a high rate of speed. Each image, called a frame, is displayed on 
screen for a very short period of time (anywhere between 1/24th to 1/30th of a second), 
creating the illusion of continuous motion. In the past, the only way to edit fi lm or video was
using a linear system. That is, an editor had to advance a fi lm reel or tape to a specifi c part 
and cut or copy from that point forward. If she or he then wanted to edit another part of the

footage, they had to advance the entire reel or tape to a new location and start again. It could 
be a very tedious and time–comsuming process. Adobe Premiere Pro is an example of a 
digital NLE (Non-Linear Editor): it gives you direct and immediate access to any frame in a 
digital video clip at any time. In an NLE process, you use computer data instead of a physical 
linear medium, such as fi lm or tape, and you can jump back and forth along your timeline at 
any point in the editing process. Unlike traditional graphic image processes, this is a non-
destructive process because the original source footage is never lost or altered. The media
links that you import or capture in Premiere Pro are only references to the original footage 
stored on your hard drive.
The video and audio footage that you edit in Premiere Pro can be digitized from an analog 
source, such as a VHS or cassette tape, or recorded directly to a digital format, as is the case with 
modern video cameras as well as other hard drive and compact fl ash-based recording devices.
 Understanding video settings
In Premiere Pro, you generally work by building sequences to match the standards of the 
media you are going to work with instead of the intended output. There are many types of 
video fi les you can work with in Premiere Pro. The various formats, aspects ratios, codecs, 
and other settings used to describe video fi les will be explained in this book. The following 
terms will help you:
Dimensions: specifi es the pixel dimensions of a video fi le; in other words, the number of 
pixels horizontally and vertically that compose an image or video frame. This value is usually 
written as a pair of numbers separated by an X, where the fi rst number is the horizontal 
value and the second represents the vertical; for example, 720 × 480. Pixel is a conjunction 
of the words “picture” and “element” and is the smallest individual component in a digital 
image. 
Frame rate: specifi es the number of individual images that compose each second of video. 
Frame rate is displayed as a value of fps (frames per second). 
Pixel Aspect Ratio: specifi es the shape of the pixels that compose an image. Pixels are
the smallest part of a digital image and diff erent display devices (televisions, computer 
monitors, etc.) have pixels with diff erent horizontal and vertical proportions.

Editing vs. delivery formats
11
Lesson 1, Understanding Digital Video
1
Editing vs. delivery formats
While working through the many lessons presented in this text you are going to encounter 
many new concepts and terms, especially when you are dealing with video footage. When 
working with video in Premiere Pro you will encounter many diff erent video formats and 
the codecs (compressor/decompressor) used to compress them while editing the video fi les
throughout the lessons in this book and when working on your own. Most computer users
are familiar with the term “format” used to describe fi les, for example, jpeg and tiff  formats
for images, or doc and ppt formats for Word and PowerPoint fi les. However, for video fi les, 
formats such as Quicktime and AVI are only containers that hold video information; much 
like a fi le folder holds paper. You can describe the relationship between formats and codecs 
this way: formats are the containers; codecs are the language the contents are written in. 
Codec is a conjunction made from the words “compressor” and “decompressor.” Codecs
are mathematical algorithms used to shrink audio and video fi les to manageable sizes. Video 
fi les are very large; for example, 20 minutes of NTSC DV video (from a standard defi nition
miniDV camcorder) is over 4 GB in size, which is the capacity of one single-layer DVD. 
Without video codecs, you could not easily save and store archived video footage; video 
would also never be small enough to watch online, by e-mail, or on a mobile device. To view 
an audio or video fi le, you must have a player compatible with the format and have on your 
computer the codec used to compress the video fi le, so you can decompress it.
Traditionally, the codecs used to capture and edit footage were uncompressed or off ered
very little compression, while the codecs used to deliver the fi nal fi les to the viewers were 
far more compressed. With the proliferation of high-defi nition video equipment, this has 
changed: many cameras now use MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 codecs to reduce fi les to manageable 
sizes for storage and editing.
Tape-based vs. tapeless formats
Prior to the proliferation of high-defi nition devices, camcorders relied on physical tapes 
to record data. VHS, Beta-max, DigiBeta, and MiniDV are examples of tape-based formats. 
While the tape-based workfl ow served the video industry well for many years, there were
drawbacks to using it. Being a physical medium, tapes would eventually degrade with reuse, 
so they had a limited lifespan. Additionally, since tapes are a linear format used for transferring 
footage stored on a digital tape to a computer—a process known as capturing—this could only
g
be performed in real-time. In other words, if you had one hour of video footage to capture, it 
took a full hour to do so. Tapeless, also called fi le-based formats, use hard-disk drives or fl ash 
drives to store video footage. When using a tapeless system, a new fi le is created whenever the
camera person presses the record/pause button on the camcorder. This off ers instant access to 
any recorded scene without the need to cue up a specifi c tape location.
With the expansion of the high-defi nition camcorder market, consumer, prosumer, and
professional-level camcorders now rely almost exclusively on tapeless, fi le-based storage
systems. These tapeless camcorders have blurred the line between editing and delivery formats, 
since most of them use either an MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 codec on the recorded video. 

12
High definition vs. standard definition
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
1
High defi nition vs. standard defi nition
Standard defi nition footage adheres to the NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) 
or PAL (Phase Alternating Line) standards, which are the standards for video used in the
United States of America and most of the rest of the world, respectively. Standard defi nition
footage usually has an aspect ratio of 4:3; in other words, there are four horizontal units for 
every three vertical units of measure. Prior to the invention of high-defi nition television, 
NTSC was the only standard for broadcast video in the United States. NTSC included
settings for both 4:3 and 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratios. In the age of Digital Television
broadcasts, the NTSC has been replaced by the ATSC (Advanced Television Systems 
Committee) standards; however, the term NTSC is still used by most video cameras, editing, 
and graphics applications to refer to standard defi nition broadcast quality video.
4:3
16:9
There are other aspect ratios used in video, 
but 4:3 and 16:9 are the most common.
NTSC & NTSC Widescreen: The NTSC presets include settings for standard (4:3) and
widescreen (16:9) aspect ratios. The dimensions for both are 720x480, but the pixel aspect
ratio is diff erent, which accounts for the diff erence in shape. Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the
ratio or shape of the pixels that compose each individual part of a single video frame. Both 
versions of the NTSC standard use a frame rate of 30 fps.
PAL & PAL Widescreen: PAL is the standard for broadcast television used throughout 
Europe and much of the rest of the world. PAL diff ers from NTSC in several key ways; such 
as dimensions and frame rate. It uses a frame rate of 25 fps, which is closer to the 24fps used 
in fi lm and according to some video professional produces more realistic imagery. Similar 
to NTSC, PAL has standard (4:3) and widescreen (16:9) settings. A frame size of 720×576 is 
shared by both, and the pixel aspect ratio gives each their unique frame shape.
High Defi nition: High Defi nition (HD) television technology has existed for decades, but 
it was during the early 21st century that it became popular with average American television
viewers. The term HD describes video with a higher resolution than traditional television 
systems, now called SD or standard defi nition. There are two main high defi nition standards 
for broadcast television: 720P and 1080i; many televisions and Blu-ray disk players support a 
third standard: 1080P.

Progressive video vs. interlaced video
13
Lesson 1, Understanding Digital Video
1
720P: the 720P format has a resolution of 1280 pixels wide by 720 pixels high and supports
a variety of frame rates, from the 24 fps used by fi lm and the 30 fps that was part of the old 
NTSC standard, to 60 fps.
1080P & 1080I: the 1080 formats exist in Interlaced and Progressive versions; as with other 
modern digital standards, these formats support a variety of frame rates, such as 24 fps, 30 fps 
and beyond. 
Progressive video vs. interlaced video
The two methods of displaying images on a video screen are Progressive display and
Interlacing. When discussing video formats, the letter P or I are often stated at the end of the 
format. For example, 1080p or 1080i footage denote whether it is progressive or interlaced. 
In the United States, and before changing to a digital broadcasting system, televised images
were sent as interlaced signals in which every frame of video was made by combining two
half-images called fi elds. 
Before the advent of high-defi nition LCD and Plasma screens, televisions were made by 
wrapping a plastic or wooden frame around a large, hollow glass device called a Cathode 
Ray Tube (CRT). These CRT television screens were composed of a series of even and odd 
numbered lines called scan lines, and each frame of video was displayed by illuminating these 
lines starting at the top of the screen. Interlacing was created to display video signals on this
type of TV set and worked by illuminating one set of lines fi rst (even or odd numbered), 
and then moving back to the top of the display to illuminate the other set. In this way, the 
display would show the second set of lines when the fi rst set of lines began to fade; the 
result was a complete picture for the viewer. This process occurred 60 times a second with 
NTSC broadcast television. Unlike Interlacing, Progressive display illuminates the scan lines 
sequentially from top to bottom.
Most modern televisions can display in interlaced and progressive mode, and the ATSC 
includes broadcast standards for both, while all computer monitors use progressive display 
only. The diff erence between the two display methods occurs in video camera formats as 
well; older NTSC or PAL cameras can only shoot interlaced video, but many newer cameras
let you choose between interlaced and progressive shooting modes, for example, 50i (25 fps), 
60i (30 fps), 30p (30 fps), and 24p (24 fps). When working in Premiere Pro, we highly
recommend that you use the sequence settings that match the settings of the footage you are 
working with.

 Premiere Pro presets
In Premiere Pro, your projects are organized and arranged into Sequences. The video you are 
going to edit is added to these Sequences, where it can be trimmed, moved, arranged, and
otherwise adjusted. Before you can edit video in Premiere Pro you must create a sequence
inside your project. This sequence is your main editing and assembling environment. 
The application includes pre-built settings for sequences called presets. With the recent
proliferation of high-defi nition video equipment and non-tape based recording media 
(cameras that store video on hard drives or fl ash drives instead of traditional tape) you can
use a wide variety of formats and specifi cations. Tapeless camcorders, also known as fi le-
based devices, usually record to hard-disks, optical media, or fl ash memory media, instead 
of to videotape, and save video and audio fi les using formats and codecs often specifi c to
each device. Tapeless formats supported by Premiere Pro include Panasonic P2 camcorders, 
Sony XDCAM HD and XDCAM EX camcorders, Sony CF-based HDV camcorders, and 
AVCHD camcorders.
In this section, you will learn about some of the common standards as they apply to working 
in Premiere Pro.
DV NTSC, DV PAL, DV 24P
The DV (Digital Video) standard comes in three varieties: NTSC, PAL, and 24P, all of which 
should be used in conjunction with IEEE1394 (FireWire/i.LINK) DV equipment. All 
three varieties of video come in standard (4:3) and widescreen (16:9) aspect ratios and have 
variations to support two standard rates for audio sampling: 32 and 48 kHz.
AVCHD
AVCHD is an acronym for Advanced Video Coding High Defi nition, a video format 
developed for the recording and playback of high-defi nition digital video. This tapeless 
format was created primarily for use in consumer and prosumer level camcorders, but it 
has also been adopted for use in some professional level equipment. The AVCHD presets in
Premiere Pro support 720p, 1080i, and 1080p video footage, each at a variety of frame rates. 
DVCPRO & DVCPROHD
Panasonic developed DVCPRO as a variation of the standard DV format. This tape-based 
format was developed to improve the standard defi nition DV format by increasing its 
robustness and feature set, and is an alternative to the DVCAM format developed by Sony. 
DVCPROHD was created as an enhanced version of the preceding DVCPRO format. The 
DVCPRO50 presets in Premiere Pro can create sequences compatible with 480i (NTSC) 
and 576i (PAL) video formats; the DVCPROHD presets can create sequences for footage
recorded at 720p, 1080i, or 1080p in a range of frame rates from 24fps to 60fps.

HDV
HDV is high-defi nition digital video. The format can store up to 1 hour of high-defi nition 
video on a standard mini-DV tape by compressing the video using the MPEG-2 codec, 
which is the same type of compression used to create DVDs. The HDV presets in Premiere 
Pro can create sequences for footage recorded at 720p, 1080i, or 1080p. HDV tape was one
of the fi rst consumer and prosumer levels of high-defi nition recording and storage available 
to the public.
XDCAM, XDCAM HD, XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD422
The XDCAM format was introduced by Sony as a tapeless solution for professional level
video recording and storage. The XDCAM family of products diff ers in everything to other 
formats, from recording media, frame size, and codec. The presets in Premiere Pro contain
support for the range of XDCAM formats: you can work with standard defi nition projects
using the DV NTSC sequence presets, while XDCAM HD, XDCAM EX, and XDCAM 
HD422 have their own presets. The XDCAM EX and XDCAM HD422 presets include 
support for 720p, 1080i, or 1080p footage; the XDCAM HD presets support 1080i and 
1080p in a range of frame rates from 24fps to 60fps.
 Overview of the post production workfl ow
Video productions are usually divided into three distinct, though interrelated, stages: Pre-
production, Production, and Post-production. The video editing, graphics integration, and 
compositing that you perform in Premiere Pro is part of the post-production stage. Once
a video project has been recorded, the work of the post-production professionals (editors, 
graphic designers, composers) begins. Large studio or production companies hire diff erent 
individuals or outside contractors for post-production work. Smaller post-production teams
share multiple positions or have one person perform the post-production work. A general 
post-production workfl ow is shown in the following fi gure.

Media acquisition
During media acquisition, you can add footage to the Premiere Pro project, which can come 
from a single source, or a variety of tape-based or tapeless sources. Footage that comes from 
an analog source, such as a VHS or Beta tape, must be digitized; digital tape-based sources, 
such as DV footage, are captured; tapeless formats are ingested. An important aspect of the 
media acquisition phase is the storage and organization of media assets. Video fi les use a lot of 
hard drive space and can be better stored on external devices, which allows you to become 
modular, thus easily transporting footage and project fi les from one computer to another. At
the same time, we recommend you develop an intuitive and easy-to-navigate folder structure 
to store your footage and help you locate specifi c footage items when needed in the latter 
stages of post-production. 
Editorial development
Editorial development is the phase when a project is assembled. The diagram above portrays
this phase as a single block of time and eff ort, but it is a multi-stage process where you can 
go through the initial editing steps to develop a rough cut, submit it for client or collaborator 
feedback, and then refi ne it in a sequential process of edits and revisions that lead into the 
fi nishing phase. Often each successive revision (called a cut) refi nes the pacing, tone, and 
theme or narrative of the work leading into the next phase. During this phase, stand-in 
graphics and audio are added into the edit while the fi nished products are developed. 
Graphics development
The graphics development phase is often concurrent with editorial development. Titles, 
eff ects shots, and compositing are integrated into a project in this portion of the workfl ow. 
This phase does not involve just one step, but a sequence of successive revisions that begin
with initial concepts and rough art work and end with the development of the fi nal graphics 
and eff ects added to the fi nished project.
Audio development
The third concurrent phase represented here is audio development. As is the case with
graphics and editorial, this phase involves a sequence of successive revisions leading to the 
creation of fi nished audio tracks added into the edit. This phase can include audio refi nement 
to clean up noise and the creation of Foley sound eff ects and background music beds.

Overview of the post production workflow
17
Lesson 1, Understanding Digital Video
1
Finishing
The fi nishing phase is where stand-in graphics and audio are replaced with the fi nished
elements, and any fi nal edits and transitions are added in Premiere Pro to create a fi nal cut. 
Mastering
The mastering phase involves compiling all the elements that the client needs, and assembling 
them into a single bundle for handoff . Depending on the required deliverables, this may be as 
simple as adding multiple individual sequences into a single master sequence for output to a
tape or fi le. It could also include preparing a variety of diff erent projects with diff erent titles, 
graphics, or audio for delivery to diff erent regions or markets.
Output and delivery
Output and Delivery is the process of creating the fi nal, playable media for handoff  to the 
client or audience. Depending on the scope of the project, this phase can take diff erent 
forms. It may involve outputting your master sequence to a tape-based format for handoff  
to a broadcast television station, authoring a DVD or multimedia playback component, or 
compressing your source footage for streaming delivery on the Web.

Questions
1 
What are names of the two diff erent standards that govern video for American and 
European television?
2 
What are the three high defi nition video standards?
3 
What are the frames rates for American television, European television and fi lm?
Answers
1 
The ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) is the name of the set of 
standards that govern American television and PAL (Phase Alternating Line) is
the standard used in Europe. In the United States the set of standards that were in 
use before the age of digital television broadcasts were called the NTSC (National 
Television Standards Committee).
2 
The three standards for high defi nition video are:
720p: the 720p format has a resolution of 1280 pixels wide by 720 pixels high and 
supports a variety of frame rates, from the 24 fps used by fi lm and the 30 fps that was
part of the old NTSC standard, to 60 fps.
1080p & 1080i: the 1080 formats exist in Interlaced and Progressive versions; as with 
other modern digital standards, these formats support a variety of frame rates between 
24 to 30 fps.
3 
American television uses a frame rate of 30 fps, while European television uses a frame
rate of 25 fps and fi lm uses a frame rate of 24 fps.

Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of some of the concepts covered in
this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Understanding the Premiere Pro interface
Adobe Premiere Pro uses a docked, panel-based interface. The entire interface
confi guration is called a workspace; the application has fi ve pre-built workspaces to 
accommodate diff erent working styles and the diff erent tasks you need to accomplish. You 
will perform most of your editing work in the diff erent panels of the program’s interface. 
These panels allow you to import and organize your media and preview your video and 
audio footage. The Timeline, where most of the actual video editing is performed, is also
a panel.
Understanding the default Editing workspace
There are many diff erent panels available in the Premiere Pro interface; the next fi gure
shows the panels available in the default Editing workspace. This workspace is specifi cally 
intended to maximize the size of your viewers, while still giving you access to important 
features, such as the Project panel and Timeline.

Lesson 2, Understanding the Workspace
2
A. Source Monitor: The Source Monitor can be used to playback and preview 
individual clips. You can also use the Source Monitor to prepare clips before you add them
to a sequence. In the Source Monitor, you can set In and Out points, add markers, and 
specify how the clip will be added to the Timeline. You can view clips in this monitor by 
dragging and dropping them into the Source panel or by double-clicking them.
B. Eff ect Controls panel: Special eff ects can be added to video and audio clips on the 
Timeline. Some eff ects, for example, can change color video to black-and-white, while
others alter the color balance of an image or can help to simulate the look of fi lm. The 
Eff ect Controls panel allows you to edit eff ects that have been applied to your clips.
To access these, you must select it in the Timeline by clicking it. If you do not have a
clip selected, the panel remains blank. You can also use the panel to access the inherent 
Motion, Opacity, and Audio properties of clips.
C. Audio Mixer: You can use the Audio Mixer to adjust settings while listening to audio 
tracks and viewing video tracks. Each Audio Mixer track corresponds to a track in the 
Timeline of the active sequence. You can also use the mixer to add eff ects, change the 
volume of relative tracks, or to record audio directly into sequence tracks.
D. Metadata panel: Metadata is a set of information that describes the content or 
properties of a fi le. Video and audio fi les automatically include information regarding 
their fi le size, format, creation date, and duration. Metadata can also include additional 
information, such as location, director, scene, shot, etc. The metadata panel allows you to
edit and view these properties so you can use them to organize and sort your fi les, or share 
with other Adobe applications.
E. Program Monitor: The Program Monitor is your live monitor; it is used to playback 
and preview only the clips on the Timeline.
F. Project panel: Video editing is a non-destructive editing process because you do 
not edit the original content of your fi les. The Project panel contains references to 
all the footage fi les (video, audio, and images) that you have imported into Premiere
Pro in addition to the sequences, titles and other supporting material you create in the
application.
G. Media Browser panel: The Media Browser helps you browse and preview fi les on 
your hard drive. You can leave the Media Browser open and dock it, just as you would any 
other panel. The Media Browser gives you quick access to all your assets while you edit.
H. Info panel: The Info panel displays information regarding the currently selected item 
in the Project panel or Timeline.
I. Eff ects panel: The Eff ects panel is a repository for all the video and audio eff ects and 
transitions available in the application. You can place transitions such as Dissolves, Dip to 
Black, and Page Peels between clips to allow you to transition from one clip to another.
You can add eff ects such as Black and White, Levels, and Balance, to individual clips, to
change their appearance or audio qualities.

22

J. Marker panel: You can use the Marker panel to see all the markers in an active clip or 
sequence. The panel displays marker information such as In and Out points, comments and 
color coding tags.
K. History panel: The History panel stores a list of the actions you have performed to
change the state of your project in the current working session. As an alternative to using 
Edit > Undo, or the keyboard commands Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Cmd+Z (Mac OS), 
you can use this panel to jump back to any previous state in the current work session. 
However, you should note that changes you make to the program that aff ect panels,
windows, or preferences are not stored in the History panel. Also, when you close and 
reopen Premiere Pro, the History panel is automatically reset and you lose access to the
previous states of your project.
L.Tools panel: This panel stores the various editing tools you can access in the 
application. The cursor changes appearance based on the tool that is active and the type of 
content that you are hovering over.
M. Timeline panel: You perform the majority of your editing work on the Timeline 
panel, including adding clips, positioning them, and changing their properties. You can 
also use the Timeline to add eff ects and transitions to the video and audio clips in your 
project. Each sequence in the project is a separate, independent Timeline. When multiple 
Timelines are visible, the panel uses a tabbed display similar to a web browser to separate 
each.
N. Audio Meters panel: This panel is a VU (Volume Units) meter. It shows the volume
of clips that are on the Timeline. The display in this panel is active only when you preview 
the video and audio clips on the Timeline.

A. Selection Tool: Use this tool to select clips, menu items, buttons, and other objects 
found in the user interface. We recommend you confi gure the Selection tool to be selected 
by default after using the more specialized editing tools, since most clip and interface 
interaction requires using the Selection tool.
B. Track Selection Tool: Use this tool to select all clips to the right of the cursor in a 
sequence. Click a clip with this tool to select the clip and the ones to the right on a single
track. Hold the Shift key and click a clip to select the clip and the ones to the right on 
every track.
C. Ripple Edit Tool: You can use the Selection tool to trim the start or end of a clip 
in the Timeline; however, you might create an empty space between the clips on your 
Timeline. Use the Ripple Edit tool to trim the In or Out point of a clip, close gaps caused
by the edit, and preserve all edits to the left or right of the trimmed clip.
D. Rolling Edit Tool: Use this tool to simultaneously change the In and Out points of 
a pair of adjacent clips on the Timeline: the Rolling Edit Tool trims the In point of one
clip and the Out point of the other clip, leaving the combined duration of the two clips
unchanged.
E. Rate Stretch Tool: This tool is used to shorten or lengthen a clip in the Timeline.
The Rate Stretch tool speeds up or slows down the playback of the clip without trimming 
the clip, thus leaving the In and Out points of the clip unchanged.
F. Razor Tool: Use this tool to split clips in the Timeline. Click any point on a clip to
split it at that exact location. To split all clips across all tracks at an exact point, press and
hold the Shift key while clicking a clip.
G. Slip Tool: Use the Slip tool to simultaneously change the In and Out points of a clip 
in a Timeline, while keeping the overall duration of the clip unchanged. 
H. Slide Tool: Use this tool to move a clip to the right or left on the Timeline while 
trimming any adjacent clips. The combined duration of the clips, and the location of the 
group in the Timeline, remain unchanged.
I. Pen Tool: All clips have a set of inherent properties that you can animate using the
Eff ect Controls panel. Select the Pen tool to set or select key frames for clips in the 
Timeline.
J. Hand Tool: Use this tool to move the viewing area of a Timeline to the right or left as
an alternative to the scroll bar at the base of the Timeline panel. 
K. Zoom Tool: Select this tool to zoom in or out in the Timeline viewing area.

Customizing the interface
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
2
 Customizing the interface
There are a series of pre-installed workspaces that come with the application to be used
as a starting point so you can begin working immediately. However, since it is impossible 
for the application’s developers to predict the needs of every user, we recommend you 
customize and adjust the interface to fi t your specifi c needs and style.
In this section, you will adjust the Editing workspace to fi t the needs of the project you 
will work with in this lesson. The fi rst procedure is to remove panels you will not be
working with at this time.
1 
Choose File > Open Project. In the Open Project dialog box that appears, navigate 
to the pr02lessons folder that you copied to your hard drive and open the fi le named
pr0201.prproj. This fi le contains a single sequence in the Project panel named
Travelogue-Boston.
An alternative way to open a project is to use a keyboard shortcut. Choose Ctrl+O (Windows)
or Command+O (Mac OS) to open an existing project.
2 
Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box that appears, navigate to the location 
on your hard drive where you saved the project fi les folder and then to the Lesson 2 
folder. Rename the fi le pr0201-working and click the Save button. This fi le will be
your working fi le for the remainder of this lesson.
 Opening, closing, and moving panels
To customize the application interface, you should close, open, and reposition panels that 
are not necessary for the type of work you will perform in this work session.
In this section, you will customize the interface to remove some of the default panels and
create a new custom editing workspace where there is more space for the Timeline. We 
recommend you have as much space as possible for the Timeline and monitors, since most
of your work is carried out in these panels.

you drag panels to rearrange them. 
As you drag a panel, a drop-zone overlay appears above the current panel group that your 
cursor is hovering over. Diff erent sections of the drop-zone become highlighted to show you 
what your new panel confi guration will be. If either section on the sides (labeled “A” in the
fi gure) illuminates, the panel that you are repositioning is placed to the side of the currently
highlighted panel, creating a new, independent panel group vertically. The same is true for the
top and bottom of the drop-zone (labeled “B” in the fi gure), except this creates a new panel 
group horizontally. The third possibility is to release your mouse while hovering over the center 
of the drop-zone (labeled “C” in the fi gure); this groups the panel that you are moving with the
existing panel group, creating a new tab.

Click the Project panel’s name tab and drag it to the Program Monitor panel. Place 
the panel onto the middle rectangular section of the drop zone so the two panels are
grouped together.
Drop zones make it easier to tell the eff ects of your panel movement.
4 
Now you will adjust the Tools panel so that you can free up even more space for the 
Timeline. Place your cursor at the dividing line between the Tools and Timeline 
panels. When the cursor becomes a double-headed arrow (

dividing line towards the Tools panel to shrink it.
When a panel is resized, the adjacent panels adjust to fi ll any empty space.

6 
Click on the Program Monitor to make it active. Your interface should now resemble
the fi gure below.
7 
Choose File > Save or press Ctrl+S (Windows) or Command+S (Mac OS) to save the
project fi le. The interface changes are saved with the fi le and will override the current 
workspace setting when this fi le is reopened.
Do not close this fi le, you will need it in the next section of this lesson, where you 
will save these interface changes as a new custom workspace.
Saving a custom workspace
As you have seen, it is very easy to customize the Premiere Pro user interface. You can also 
save custom workspaces so you can return to a favorite or helpful panel confi guration later. 
In this part of the lesson, you will save the workspace you created as a new workspace, and
then reset the Editing workspace to its original confi guration.
1 
With the pr0201-working.prproj fi le still open, choose Window > Workspace > 
New Workspace to open the New Workspace dialog box.
2 
Change the default name of the workspace to Digital Classroom-Editing and click 
the OK button to save the workspace. This also makes your new workspace the active
one. This new workspace saves with the application and will be available to you, even
if you reset the application’s preferences.
You can delete Workspaces by choosing Window > Workspace > Delete Workspace. This opens
the Delete Workspace dialog box, where you can choose the workspace you want to delete from a
drop-down menu. You can delete any workspace except the currently active one.
3 
Choose Window > Workspace > Editing to return to the Editing workspace. Notice 
that it still refl ects the changes you made when you were customizing the workspace 
in the previous exercise: as you customize any workspace, you automatically append 
it, thus making your changes part of the current state. To return this workspace to its
original confi guration, you must reset it as explained in the next step.

Setting application preferences

Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace. In the confi rmation
dialog that appears, choose Yes to reset the Editing workspace and return the
Workspace to its original appearance.

Choose Window > Workspace > Digital Classroom-Editing to return to the custom 
workspace that you created. For the remainder of this lesson you will be using this
custom workspace.
6 
Choose File > Save or press Ctrl+S (Windows) or Command+S (Mac OS) to save the 
project fi le.
 Setting application preferences
Application preferences control the overall functionality of Premiere Pro, and you can edit 
them at any time. The application preferences allow you to change nearly any aspect of the
program, from the default length of transitions and still images, to the interface color and
the frequency and number of automatic backups made for your projects.
In this section, you will confi gure the auto-save feature to make more copies of your 
project fi le at shorter intervals.
1 
With the pr0201-working.prproj fi le still open, choose Edit > Preferences >
General (Windows) or Premiere Pro > Preferences > General (Mac OS) to open the
Preferences dialog box.
2 
From the list of categories on the left, choose Auto Save to view the preferences for 
how Premiere Pro automatically backs up your fi les.
There are two settings for the application’s Auto Save functionality: Automatically 
Save Every and Maximum Project Versions. 
3 
Change the value of the Automatically Save Every property to 10 minutes, and then 
change the value of Maximum Project Versions to 10 as well. Click OK. 

30
Setting application preferences
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom

This increases the frequency of the Auto Save function, while creating more project 
versions so you have a greater choice of fi le back-ups. While most users will admit
that auto-save is a great feature, not all can agree on the best frequency for saving fi les. 
When the application runs the auto-save command, it can interrupt what you are
doing and some users fi nd this quite distracting.
Auto Save is helpful when the application closes unexpectedly or you need to return to an earlier version of your project.
The Auto Save function does not save over your project fi le; instead it creates backups of your 
project fi le and saves them to the Adobe Premiere Pro Auto-Save folder. This folder is created 
automatically by the application and stored in the same location as your original project fi le.
4 
Choose File > Save or press Ctrl+S (Windows) or Command+S (Mac OS) to save the
project fi le. Do not close this fi le; you will need it in the next exercise.

Using the Project panel

Lesson 2, Understanding the Workspace
2
 Using the Project panel
As mentioned previously, the Project panel contains references to all th  e footage fi les 
(video, audio, and images) that you have imported into Premiere Pro. As such, it is the 
creative hub for all you will create with this application. In addition to references to your 
imported footage, the panel holds the Sequences and Titles that you can create within the 
application, and is where you locate the items you want to add to the Timeline. 
 Understanding media management
Media Management is the organization or management of the media you work with in 
a project. There are two equally important aspects to Media Management. The fi rst is 
how you manage the media on your hard drives, and the second is how you organize the
diff erent media references that you import into Premiere Pro.
To ensure portability, performance, and security, many users highly recommend that 
you store media on an external hard disk drive. The two standard connection types for 
external hard drives are FireWire (400 and 800) and USB 2.0 and 3.0. Mac users also have
access to a third high-speed connection format called thunderbolt. Many video editors 
recommend a FireWire drive because of its higher sustained bus speed, but any type of 
drive works for your projects, though newer technologies, such as thunderbolt and USB 
3.0, also provide excellent connections for media storage drives. Depending on your 
system confi guration, these connection types may not be available to you at this time.
The fi les that you will work with to complete the lessons in this book are organized into 
a single folder called Media Library. Within that folder, there are additional folders for 
each individual project. In each respective project folder, there are folders that separate 
the diff erent types of media (video, audio, and still images) you will use. This type of 
hierarchical structure is also used to keep the project panel organized and makes it easier to 
locate the media you want to add to the Timeline panel.
 Before you can edit any piece of footage on the Timeline, you must fi rst add it to your 
Premiere Pro project. You can import a wide variety of media, including video, audio, still

In this section, you will import a variety of media fi les into your project that you can later 
organize and add to your Timeline.

With the pr0201-working fi le still open, confi rm that you are using the Digital 
Classroom-Editing workspace that you created earlier in this lesson. If you have made 
any changes to the workspace, you should reset it now. If the Project panel is hidden
behind the Program Monitor, click on the Project panel tab now to bring it forward 
and make it active.

Choose File > Import to open the Import dialog box, then navigate to the Media
Library folder located inside the prlessons folder that you copied to your hard drive.
Select the Travelogue-Boston folder, and then select the Video subfolder to reveal the 
video fi les you will import for this lesson.
The keyboard shortcut for the import command is Ctrl+I (Windows) or Command+I (Mac OS).

Inside the Video folder, there is a series of video fi les shot in and around the city of 
Boston.
Click the fi rst video fi le displayed in the dialog box, hold the Shift key on your 
keyboard, and then click the last fi le displayed to select every fi le between them.
Click the Import button to import all the selected fi les into your project panel.
All recently imported fi les are automatically selected/highlighted in the project panel.
Holding the Shift key while selecting fi les only selects fi les in a sequential list. To select fi les non-
sequentially, hold the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key and click individual fi les.

In addition to importing individual or groups of fi les, you can import entire folders
and their content.
Choose File > Import and navigate to the Travelogue-Boston folder in the Media 
Library. In the Import dialog box, click once on the Audio folder to select it, and click 
the Import button.
Importing entire folders is a quick way of importing multiple fi les, along with their content and subfolders.
When you import a folder into Premiere Pro, the application automatically creates a 
bin in the Project panel with the same name as the imported folder. The content of the
folder on your hard drives, as well as the content of any sub-folders, is placed inside 
this bin.
In NLE (Non-Linear Editing) parlance, a bin is basically just the name for a fi le folder.
The functionality of bins in the Premiere Pro Project panel is almost identical to those 
of the fi le folders on your computer.

Click the reveal triangle to the left of the Audio bin to show the clips that you 
imported. Notice that the three fi les that are inside of the folder on your computer’s 
hard drive have all been imported into Premiere Pro. When importing a folder, the 
content of any sub-folders it may contain is also imported.
Each bin’s reveal triangle can show and hide the bin’s contents.
6 
Choose File > Save or press Ctrl+S (Windows) or Command+S (Mac OS) to save the
project fi le.
In the next part of the lesson, you will create a new bin to hold the video fi les you just
imported and keep the project panel organized.
Creating and org anizing bins
The term bins comes from the days of editing fi lm when the developed fi lm clips were 
stored in bins for easy organization. In the Premiere Pro project panel, bins serve as fi le 
folders to hold and organize your media assets. Bins can hold any combination of media: 
video, audio, still images, and even other bins. The organizational scheme you use for this 
exercise will create a separate bin for each diff erent type of media used in the project.
The media management strategy that you adopt depends on the specifi cs of the project and 
the quantity of footage. For larger projects, you might break the footage into bins based on 
the content of the video, location, or for dramatic works, the footage needed for a specifi c
scene (scene-based organizational system).

If the Audio bin is still selected, click on any empty area of the Project panel to 
deselect it. Then create a new bin by clicking the New Bin button located at the
bottom-right of the Project panel. Rename this bin Video and press Enter (Windows)
or Return (Mac OS) to confi rm the new bin name. 
When you create a new bin, it will automatically be placed inside the bin that you 
currently have selected. This is why it is important to remember to deselect the Audio 
bin in this step.
When you create a new bin, the default name is highlighted immediately so you can change it. If 
you click another item in the Project panel or click another pane, the name becomes deselected. To
make the name editable again, right-click the bin name and choose Rename from the menu that 
appears. Additionally, double-clicking the name of any item in the Project panel makes the name 
editable.
The term bin is a legacy from the days of fi lm editing. In practice, bins function exactly like the folders on your hard drive.

Release the Shift key and then click any one of the selected fi les and drag it to the
Video bin. When the bin’s name becomes highlighted, release the mouse to move all
the selected fi les into the bin.
Moving and arranging media items in the Project panel is similar to moving and arranging fi les on your hard drive.

Release the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key and then drag either of 
the selected bins into the Boston Footage bin. This moves both the selected bins inside 
the bin named Boston Footage. 
Storing bins inside one another is an effi  cient organizational tool and can prevent the Project panel from becoming cluttered.

Now that you have organized the Project panel, in the next part of the lesson you will 
modify the panels display so that it is easier to view the most relevant information
about your media items.

Modifying the Project panel display
The Project panel displays information about each item it contains in a series of columns 
to the right of each item’s name. This information display can be customized so that you
can control which properties display and in what order. This allows you to view only the
attributes that are most relevant to the type of work you are currently doing at any given
time in Premiere Pro.
Adding/removing columns in the Project panel
The default column display can be changed, to add hidden panels or remove panels that 
you may consider extraneous.
1 
Since the Project panel is very small when compared with the overall Premiere Pro 
interface, seeing all the columns at the same time is impossible. The fi rst thing you 
will do is expand the panel to full-screen size. Note that even in full-screen mode you 
may not be able to view every data column in the Project panel depending on your 
monitor’s resolution. If necessary, click on any area of the Project panel to select it.
You will know it is selected when it has an orange border around it.

The expanded Project panel makes it much easier to see each clip’s properties.
Click on the menu button located at the upper-right corner of the Project panel and 
from the menu that appears, choose Metadata Display. Metadata is information that
is attached to fi les that contains extra information about the fi le. For a video clip,
metadata could include information such as the length, audio information, or frame 
size and rate.
Even though the clip properties are only used inside 
Premiere Pro they are still listed as a part of the 
overall metadata properties.

Hours
Timecode is used in video editing and motion graphics programs to keep track of your position
along a Timeline, tape, or any time-based medium. You can identify timecode as a series of four 
numbers separated by colons or semicolons. As seen in the example above and reading from left 
to right, the numbers represent: Hours;Minutes;Seconds;Frames.
You can count hours, minutes, and seconds in much the same way as you would with a standard 
clock, but the counting begins at zero instead of one. The one variable with timecode is the 
number of frames that make up a second, which is based on the frame rate of the media you 
are dealing with. Depending on the Composition settings, you could be using the American 
television standard of 30 FPS (frames per second), the European standard of 25 FPS, or the fi lm
standard of 24 FPS. In essence, timecode provides a discrete address to each frame of video.

In the next section, you will edit the clip descriptions and change the order that the 
columns display in. 
Adding a clip description
Some of the columns in the Project panel are purely descriptive; they display information 
about the properties of the footage you are working with. Columns such as Media Start, 
Media End, and Media Duration are non-editable, while others, such as Video In Point, 
Video Out Point, and Video Duration, can be changed as you work with your clips in 
Premiere Pro. Columns such as Description can be edited directly in the Project panel
itself. Clip descriptions can be very helpful, especially when working on longer, more 
complex projects, or when working in a team environment. The Description column of 
the Project panel contains an editable text fi eld that can be used to hold a wide variety of 
information, such as a content description, or to note intended usage.

With the Project panel still expanded to the full size of the screen and active, click the
Description column header and drag it to the left. As you drag the column name, a 
dark highlight appears between each pair of names.
Drag the Description column until this highlight is between the Label and Video In 
Point columns, and then release it to rearrange the column order.
You can drag any column title to the left or right to change the arrangement of the Project panel’s columns.
2 
You have repositioned the Description column, but the default size of the column is 
very small, leaving very little room in which to add a description.
Place your cursor on the dividing line between the Description and Label column 
headers. When the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow, click and drag to the
right to change the width of the Description column to make it approximately double 
its current size. Note that all the other columns move over to accommodate the size 
change.

After enlarging the Description column, repeat these steps for the Name column
so you can see the full name of each audio and video fi le. Depending on the screen
resolution of your monitor, enlarging the Name fi eld may not be necessary.
You can quickly edit visually the width of each column directly from the Project panel interface.

Locate the clip named Boston Cityscape 01.mts. You can edit a clip’s Description 
property at any time.
Click in the clip’s description fi eld and add the following description: Static shot of 
the Boston Area Skyline.
Press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to deselect this 
clip’s text fi eld and automatically select the next clip’s description fi eld.
If you do not want to select the next clip’s description, you can click any empty area of the project 
panel with your cursor to deselect the active text fi eld.

In your own projects, you should consider giving each clip in the project panel a 
unique description. This can include any information you feel is important to your 
editing process, such as time of day, the subject of the shot, or notes on camera
position or movement.

Organizing content by columns
The columns of the project panel are used to control how the diff erent items in the panel 
display. You can arrange your clips based on the content of any column.

In the Project panel, the default organization is alphabetically based on the name. In the 
case of bins, the bin name is used to arrange all the media it contains. The active panel 
shows either a downward or upward pointing chevron next to the column header.
2 
Click the Column Name to reverse the standard ascending display order and notice 
how items reverse their display order in the panel and are now displayed in descending 
order. When working on your own projects, you can choose the order you prefer. For 
this project, we will place the Travelogue-Boston Sequence at the top of the display.
The footage display in the Project panel can be based on any currently displayed column. Simply click on any column heading 
to reorder the footage in the panel.

Locating missing media
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
2
Searching in the Project panel
If you are working on a complex project with many diff erent footage items, it can become
very diffi  cult to fi nd the items you are looking for in the Project panel. To make organizing and 
fi nding your footage easier, the panel has a search fi eld that you can use to quickly fi nd what you
are looking for. Simply type the term you want to search for into the text fi eld, and the Project 
panel begins to hide any item that doesn’t match. For additional control, you can use the “In” 
drop-down menu to set the types of fi elds that are part of the search criteria.
As long as any text is present in the Search fi eld, the display of the Project panel is aff ected. Use
the X icon to the right of the text area to clear the current search.
Locating missing media
Premiere Pro creates a link between your project fi les and the fi les that you import into 
the Project panel. This linkage system allows you to have a very small project fi le, but at 
the same time requires that you manage the media you are using in your projects. If you 
move, rename, or delete fi les that you are using in a project you will receive a missing 
media warning when Premiere Pro attempts to open it. Likewise, if you edit a fi le name 
or location while a project is open in Premiere Pro, you will receive a missing media error. 
You should always locate any missing fi les before attempting to proceed with your project.
The process for locating missing fi les is automatic and will help you fi nd video, audio, 
stills, and images. The next steps are not intended to be followed right now, but are
presented here as reference for when you do encounter a missing media warning.

When presented with the Link Media dialog box, verify the clip and fi le names 
listed. These listed fi les are the ones that Premiere Pro has been unable to locate
automatically while opening the project fi le.
The application will automatically open the dialog box when a project with missing fi les is opened.
Most of hthe options in the Link Media di lalog are pretty straight forwa drd. However, the choices 
off ered for dealing with missing fi les can use some explanation. You have three choices when 
dealing with the Link Media dialog box. You can have the program set the missing media as 
offl  ine. In this case, the clip entry will appear in Premiere Pro without any attached media that 
cannot be displayed. In the Premiere Pro Project panel, offl  ine fi les can be brought online by 
right-clicking them in the Project panel and choosing Link Media from the menu that appears.
Additionally, you can cancel the search operation or attempt to locate your missing media. With
the exceptp ion off some veryy spep cifi fic workfl flows, you will usually y choose to locate the missingg media.

Click the Locate button. By default, Premiere Pro will open the Media Browser panel. 
Use the directory tree on the right to navigate to the missing fi le, highlight it, and 
then click the OK button to relink the fi le.
When all missing fi les have been recovered, the project will open.
If your missing fi les are still in the same relative folder structure as when they were
fi rst imported into your project, Premiere Pro will locate and automatically relink
them all, once it knows the location of the fi rst one. If it cannot automatically fi nd 
other missing fi les you will have to locate them manually. Once all missing fi les have
been found or skipped, the project will open.
If you prefer to use the standard fi le dialog box that is native to your operating system, you can
uncheck the Use Media Browser to locate fi les check box in the Link Media dialog box.

Questions
1 
What type of content is contained in the Project panel?
2 
What is the diff erence between the Source and Program monitors?
3 
When viewing the timecode display what do the four diff erent sets of numbers 
represent?
Answers
1 
The Project panel contains references to all the footage fi les (video, audio, and images)
that you have imported into Premiere Pro in addition to the sequences, titles and other 
supporting material you create in the application.
2 
You can use the source monitor to playback and preview individual clips or to prepare
clips before you add them to a sequence. The Program monitor is used only to
preview the clips that have already been added to the Timeline.
3 
The four diff erent sets of numbers in a timecode display are:
Hours;Minutes;Seconds;Frames. So the following timecode: 00;00;04;14 would represent
a time mark of 4 seconds and 14 frames.

• To export media for use 
in Premiere Pro
Prepping Files in Prelude
Adobe Prelude is a video ingest and logging tool. It allows you 
to ingest footage from tapeless media, rename clips, add and edit 
metadata and transcode to nearly any format.
Starting up
In this lesson, you will work with the project fi les from the pr03lessons folder. Make 
sure that you have loaded the prlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied
DVD. The Starting up section at the start of this book provides detailed information
about loading lesson fi les, resetting your workspace, locating missing media, and opening 
the fi les in CC. If you have not already done so, please review these instructions before
starting this lesson.
When opening the Premiere Pro project fi les used in this lesson you may experience a
missing media message. You must locate any missing media before trying to proceed 
through the lesson. For more information refer to “Locating missing media” in the
Starting up section of this book.

Adobe Prelude is a video ingest and logging tool. Ingesting is the term used to describe
the process of bringing footage from your tapeless camera to your computer for editing. 
Logging is a term used to describe the process of annotating your video footage. While 
both of these two tasks can be accomplished in Premiere Pro itself, Prelude has the added 
ability to batch encode your source video fi les. You may be asking yourself why would
you need Prelude if you already have Premiere Pro? Prelude can be used to improve the 
effi  ciency of your editing workfl ow; with it’s simple streamlined interface the ingest, 
verifi cation and logging of video footage is quicker and easier.
Prelude fi nds additional use a tool for a team-based workfl ow. With a simple interface 
designed to perform only a few specifi ed tasks, it is a perfect tools for team members who
may not be familiar with the use of Premiere Pro. Using Prelude assistant editors and 
even directors or producers can quickly create video sequences from ingested footage, add
markers for notation and export them all to Premiere Pro for more detailed editing.

In the Ingest dialog box you have several choices that allow you to process your footage while 
ingesting it. 
Transfer: The Transfer section is used to copy the video clips you are ingesting from your 
tapeless media to another location of your choosing. Additionally, when copying these fi les you 
can use the Transcode option to convert them from your camera’s native fi le format into a wide 
variety of other formats.
File Metadata: The File Metadata section is used to add meta data to your video fi les at ingest.
File Rename: Since tapeless cameras often use generic names for vide clips the File Rename 
section can be used to bath rename your fi les at the point of ingestion.

Logging video
The process of logging video clips involves watching your video clips and then adding 
descriptions to them based on their content. Prior to the advent of digital video and
editing technology this process involved creating written log books that listed important
events in the video next to time code references for their locations. Now the process
involves adding metadata to the fi les description and other fi elds

much background noise.
Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace to return Prelude to the 
default Logging workspace. Click Yes in the dialog box that appears to ask you to 
confi rm your decision.
The metadata that you add here in Prelude is added either to the fi le itself or to an
XMP sidecar fi le that is saved to the same location as your media and will be visible 
when you add these fi les to a Premiere Pro project or when previewing them in a 
metadata viewer or search application.
Do not close the fi le, you will need it in the next section of this lesson.
In the next part of this lesson you will add comments and marks to the clips in this
project in preparation of importing it into Premiere Pro.
Adding Comment markers
The metadata that you added in the previous part of this lesson can be accessed by almost 
any program intended to read metadata. However there are specifi c workfl ows in place 
for moving fi les between Prelude and Premiere Pro. To speed up your work you can add 
markers and comments to clips that are visible while editing. There are several diff erent
types of markers you can create:

64
Adding Comment markers
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom

Subclip: used to create In and Out points that mark subclips for editing. When the project 
is saved the generated subclips appear in the Project panel.
Comment: add a comment or note to a clip at a specifi ed point in time. You use 
comment markers to indicate important times in a video fi le. 
Flash Cue Point: When exporting to the Flash Video format (fl v, f4v) Flash Cue Point
markers can be used to trigger external scripted events or used as navigational points.
Web Link: When exported to certain video formats that support them add a URL to a 
point in time on a video fi le that can be used to provide additional information about the 
movie clip.
Chapter: When imported into Adobe Encore and Premiere Pro these markers are used to 
create chapter points for DVD and Blu-ray disk projects.
Speech Transcription: These markers are used to edit speech-to-text transcriptions 
created in applicatiosn such as Adobe Media Encoder or even to add such data manually.
In this part of the lesson you will create a comment and subclip markers.

With the pr0301-working.plproj still open, double-click on
Reporter at Crime Scene.mpeg fi le to preview it in the Monitor and Timeline 
panels.
You previewed this fi le in an earlier step, it is video of a news anchor introducing a
story and then signing off . Now you will add a marker to indicate where the intro 
ends. This information will help you later when you export this fi le to Premiere Pro.
The Prelude interface is designed to perform a few very specifi c tasks.

element it is necessary to save after any one of them is changed.
Do not close the fi le, you will need it in the next section of this lesson.
Adding Subclip markers
Subclips allow you to digitally sub-divide a master video clip into individual segments. 
This is a good way of separating long clips or multiple takes into manageable blocks of 
video.
1 
With the pr0301-working.plproj still open, double-click on the
Bystander Interview 01.mpeg to load it into the Monitor and Timeline panels.
2 
Click the the Play-Stop toggle button at the bottom of the Monitor Panel to preview 
the video fi le. Click the toggle button again to stop the preview at any time. This 
video contains a bystander in the park being interviewed by the reporter from the 
earlier scene. 
Only a small part of this video clip is usable, so you will now make a subclip out of 
this section.
3 
Move the playhead to the 5 second and 5 frame (00:00:05:05) mark on the Timeline 
panel.
The Monitor panel’s Timecode display will show you where the playhead (also called the 
Current Time Indicator) is along the Timeline. You can use the left and right arrow keys on your 
keyboard to move the playhead back or forward one frame at a time.
4 
Choose Marker > Add > Subclip Marker. This places a subclip marker into the 
timeline. The In point of the subclip is set to the current position of the playhead
while it’s Out point runs until the end of the clip.

Move the playhead to the 18 second (00:00:18:00) mark on the Timeline and then 
press the Out button located in the Marker Inspector panel. This sets the Out point of 
this marker to the current position of the playhead.
Change the marker’s name to Bystander Interview 01-Subclip.
The marker’s name appears in the timeline next to the start of the marker.
6 
Choose File > Save or press Ctrl+S (windows) or Cmd+S (Mac OS) to save the 
Prelude project fi le. Notice that a new entry appears in the Project panel to denote the 
subclip you have just created. 
If you want to edit the subclip or even delete it those changes will take eff ect the next
time you save the fi le.
Do not close the fi le, you will need it in the next section of this lesson.
Creating a rough cut
Adobe Prelude is in no way a fully featured editing application. It does however have the
ability to be used for simple footage assembly. This allows you to create rough cuts that 
can then be exported to Premiere Pro for later fi nishing.
1 
With the pr0301-working.plproj still open, Choose File > Create Rough Cut. In
the Create Rough Cut dialog box that appears, navigate to the Lesson03 folder on 
your hard drive. Change the text in the Save As text fi eld to Crime Scene Report
and click the Save button.
Notice that a new item with the Media Type of Rough Cut appears in the Project panel.
In the Project panel items can be easity recognized by their Media Type.

Double-click on the Crime Scene Report Rough Cut in the Project
panel to load it into the Monitor and Timeline panels and then drag the 
Reporter at Crime Scene.mpeg video clip into the Timeline panel. Notice that the
Rough Cut appears in the Project panel as a new item.
Video clips can be dragged into either the Timeline or Monitor panels.
3 
Choose File > Save.
When this fi le is exported to Premiere Pro, the Rough Cut will be converted into 
a Sequence. The video that you have added here will already be present on it’s 
timeline. If you are using Prelude to set up all of your Premiere Pro sequences you 
could continue to add additional video clips to the Rough Cut or add markers and in
general mock up a very detailed sequence. However, in this lesson we are only using 
it as a part of our workfl ow and we will continue our work in Premiere Pro in the
next lesson.
Do not close the fi le, you will need it in the next section of this lesson.
Exporting to Premiere Pro
Once you have prepared your media for Premiere Pro actually exporting it is a fairly quick
and easy process. You select the content in the Prelude Project panel that you want to 
send to Premiere Pro and then simply export it. Prelude bundles the content together into 
a prproj fi le. This is a Premiere Pro project fi le that can be opened just using the File > 
Open command once you get to Premiere Pro.

Lesson 4, Making the Cut
What you’ll learn 
in this lesson:
• The methodology of 
the continuity editing 
process seen in film and 
television
• To trim clips with the 
selection and razor tools
• To target and use 
multiple video tracks
Making the Cut
Video editing changes the arrangement and duration of video and 
audio clips to craft a narrative. An editor arranges footage to create a 
coherent story paced to appeal to the audience. Now that you have 
learned to organize your project, in this lesson you will discover how 
to edit clips on the Timeline. 
 Starting up
In this lesson, you will work with the project fi les from the pr04lessons folder. Make 
sure that you have loaded the prlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied
DVD. The Starting up section at the start of this book provides detailed information
about loading lesson fi les, resetting your workspace, locating missing media, and opening 
the fi les in CC. If you have not already done so, please review these instructions before
starting this lesson.
When opening the Premiere Pro project fi les used in this lesson you may experience a
missing media message. You must locate any missing media before trying to proceed 
through the lessons. Please refer to the ”Locating missing media” in the Starting up
section of this book.
Lesson 4

The cuts-only editing methodology
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom

See Lesson 4 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
The cuts-only editing methodology
In traditional fi lm and video, continuity editing makes use of very few transitions, and 
the straight cut is the preferred method of getting from one scene or shot to another.
When working with a cuts-only editing approach, the editor attempts to fi nd a match 
cut, in which diff erent scenes, people, or objects share a similar visual relationship. This
relationship can be based on screen position, similar movement or color value, or a wide
variety of other criteria. This type of cut forms the basis of the continuity editing style, the
goal of which is to create a seamless and non-jarring change. 
 A Roll vs. B Roll
The terms A Roll and B Roll describe the primary and secondary footage shot and used 
in video and fi lm productions. In an edit, B Roll is used to add or enhance the meaning 
of the main footage or to cover the removal of unwanted or error-ridden material. For 
example, in a documentary production, the A Roll would contain interview footage 
and the B Roll would contain exteriors, establishing shots, or footage that describes or 
illustrates the topics described in the documentary. In dramatic work, the B Roll might
contain additional angles on the main subject or secondary subjects present in a scene.
Cut-ins and Cut-aways
Cut-ins and cut-aways are instantaneous shifts in the framing of a shot. Both techniques 
are related to the primary focus or action of a scene and can be used to enhance the 
meaning or alleviate the tedium of long scenes. Cut-ins and cut-aways are often used to 
show an event occurring alongside the main action of the scene. A cut-in is a cut that 
shifts from the main subject (A Roll) to an event occurring inside the same scene. For 
example, if your main scene involves two people shaking hands, a possible cut-in might be
a close-up of the handshake.
A Cut-away is a cut away from the main action to other simultaneous events. For example, 
in the scene of the two people shaking hands, a possible cut-away might show other people 
entering the room. Cut-ins and cut-aways rarely add dramatic content, but usually control
the pacing of longer scenes, introduce new elements to the main scene, or emphasize
elements already present.

Lesson 4, Making the Cut
4
Cutting on action
Cutting on action is a standard practice of continuity editing that refers to a technique 
in which you cut from one shot to another that matches or anticipates the action of the 
fi rst shot. In other words, a subject begins an action in one shot and seems to complete
or continue it in the next, creating a visual join or bridge that prevents the viewer from
noticing the cut itself. For example, a shot of someone beginning to bow can be cut to a 
shot of the same subject continuing the action from a diff erent angle. A shot of a person 
looking up in response to a knock on a door can be cut to a shot of another person 
walking through a door.
In this lesson, you will use A Roll and B Roll footage to create a faux newscast. This
footage is from a short fi lm project named Riding Hood, about a group of folkloric creatures
roaming the streets of New York City. In the scene used for this lesson, the police are 
investigating an attack on a pedestrian in Central Park, and a reporter from a local news 
network has just arrived to cover the story. You will have A Roll of the news reporter to 
be intercut with B Roll footage of comments from onlookers and establishing shot of the 
area. To complete this edit, you will trim clips in the Monitor and Timeline, add extra 
tracks to the Timeline to hold your clips, and learn to specify the destination track for 
inserted footage.
All the media used in this section of the lesson can be found in the Werewolves of Central 
Park folder in the Media Library. The Reporter at Crime Scene.mpeg fi le can be found in
the A Roll sub-folder while the remainder of the footage used can be found in the B Roll
sub-folder.
Trimming clips in the Source Monitor
The Source Monitor is one of the most important tools you can use to preview and trim 
clips in preparation for the Timeline. You can preview all footage used in Premiere Pro 
using the Source monitor, except for the content of Sequences, which you can preview in 
the Program Monitor. To preview footage, you can double-click a footage item or drag it 
to the Source Monitor panel.
Every clip in the project panel and on the Timeline has an In Point, an Out Point
and a duration. When a clip is imported into Premiere Pro, its In and Out points are 
automatically set to the physical beginning and end of the clip, allowing it to run for its 
full duration. However, many times you might want to use a portion of a clip in your 
project. In such situations, you can trim the clip by setting new In and Out points using 
the Source monitor. 
The footage used in this part of the lesson can be found in the Werewolves in Central Park 
folder, located inside the Media Library folder.

Click the Play-Stop Toggle button at the bottom of the Source Monitor to preview the 
fi le. This subclip was created in Prelude and is 12 seconds and 19 frames in duration. It
involves the crime scene reporter interviewing a panicky bystander. This subclip was 
purposely created to have extra unneeded footage (called handles) at the beginning 
and end of the clip. We highly recommend that you shoot and capture footage with 
this extra padding so you do not accidentally fi nish with a clip that starts or ends right 
on the action or dialog you want to use. You may miss some really interesting and 
usable footage if you do.

Using multiple video tracks
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
4
Using multiple video tracks
You could keep all your clips on a single video track, but it might not always be a practical 
solution, especially when dealing with a complicated editing job. For example, you can
easily create a cut-in or cut-away by placing a new clip containing B Roll footage on a
track above the one containing an A Roll. Multiple tracks are also useful when you need 
to place graphics or titles above your video footage, or to compose multiple video clips to 
create a ghostly eff ect.
Adding and deleting tracks in the Timeline
When you create a new sequence in Premiere Pro, you can specify the number of audio 
and video tracks to include in the Tracks panel of the New Sequence dialog box. By 
default, the dialog box creates video and audio tracks for each new sequence based on 
the preset used, but you can add additional tracks or remove empty, unused ones. In this
lesson’s project, the Central Park Coverage sequence has only a single video track.
In this part of the lesson, you will add a new video track to the sequence so you can add 
the trimmed Bystander Interview 01 clip to it.
1 
With the pr0401-working.prproj project still open, right-click (Windows) or 
Ctrl+click (Mac OS) in the empty space above the Video 1 track in the Timeline, and
then choose Add Tracks to open the Add Tracks dialog box. Another option to open 
the Add Tracks dialog box is to choose Sequence > Add Tracks.
You must right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) an empty area of the Timeline track header to open the context menu.
2 
If necessary, in the Video Tracks section of the Add Tracks dialog box, set the Video
Tracks to add to 1; then, in the Audio Tracks section, set the number of audio tracks to 
add to 1.
The third section allows you to add a video sub mix track to the Timeline. By default,
it should be set it to 0. You can specify where the new video and audio tracks are 
placed in relation to the current tracks on the Timeline. Confi rm that the new video 
track is placed after Video 1 and the new audio track is placed after Audio 1. Confi rm 
also that the new audio track is a Standard track.

Click OK to close the dialog box.
The Add Track dialog box allows you to add Video, Audio, and 
Audio Sub mix tracks to your Timeline.
To delete tracks, right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) a current track and choose 
Delete Track from the menu that appears. You can also open the Delete Tracks dialog box by
choosing Sequence > Delete Tracks. In the dialog box that appears, choose whether to delete 
Audio and Video tracks by name or remove all empty audio and video tracks. Remember that 
the sequence needs at least one of each track type at all times; you cannot remove a track if it is 
the last of its kind left on the Timeline.
4 
Double-click the empty space to the right of the Video 2 track’s Toggle Track 
Output (
) button. This expands the track’s height to match that of Video 1. Repeat
this for Audio 2 to expand this track as well.

Renaming tracks
By default, Premiere Pro names tracks in a sequential manner: Video 1, Video 2, Audio 1, 
Audio 2, etc. You can change the names to more easily identify which tracks hold specifi c
types of content.
1 
With the pr0401-working.prproj project still open and the Timeline panel active,
right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) the track header for the Video 1 track
and choose Rename from the menu that appears. Change the default name to A-Roll
and press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to exit the 
text editing mode.
2 
Right-click the Video 2 track that you created in the previous exercise and again 
choose Rename from the menu that appears. Change the default name to B-Roll and
press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to exit the text
editing mode.
3 
Repeat this process for both audio tracks, renaming Audio 1 to A-Roll and Audio 2 
to B-Roll.
Renaming tracks can be a helpful way of keeping your Sequence organized.

Adding clips to the Timeline
You can add clips d irectly to the Timeline from the Project panel, Media Browser, or 
Source Monitor. In this lesson, you will add the clips that you trimmed in a previous 
exercise by dragging them from the Source Monitor and dropping them into an 
appropriate place on the Timeline.
1 
With the pr0401-working.prproj project still open, if necessary, double-click the
Bystander Interview 01-Subclip.mpeg in your Project panel to make it active and 
open it in the Source Monitor. This action also makes the Source Monitor active.
Make sure you double-click the icon to the left of the clip name and not the name
itself. Double-clicking the icon loads the clip into the Source Monitor, while 
double-clicking the name makes the name fi eld editable.
Notice the two icons located just below the video frame; one is similar to a fi lm strip 
and the other is similar to an audio waveform. These icons indicate that the currently
selected clip contains both an audio and a video track, and they also have another use. 
These icons can also be used to add only the audio or video portion of a clip to the 
timeline.

In the Timeline panel, move the playhead to the 9-second and 10-frame (00:00:09:10) 
mark. This is the timecode position of the marker that was added to the Reporter at 
Crime Scene clip on the Timeline. This will serve as the target destination when you 
add the Bystander Interview 01-Subclip to the timeline. 
You can also move the playhead to the location of a timeline or clip marker by dragging it.
To make the playhead snap to the position of a marker, press and hold the shift key on your 
keyboard while dragging it.
3 
Press and hold the Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac OS) key on your keyboard, and then 
click the middle of the video frame in the Source Monitor and drag it to the A-Roll
track on the Timeline. Drag the clip until your cursor lines up to the current position
of the playhead; then drop the video at this point.
You have just completed an insert edit. This type of edit splits the clip that is already
on the timeline at the position where you drop the new clip. This action extends the 
duration of the entire timeline to accommodate the added clip.
Pressing and holding the Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd(Mac OS) key while dragging a clip into the timeline creates an Insert Edit.

In the Timeline panel, move the playhead to the beginning (00;00;00;00) and press the
spacebar on your keyboard to preview the clips in the Program Monitor.
You can start previews in the Timeline using keyboard commands or in the Program Monitor using the Transport controls.
You can stop the Timeline playback at any time by pressing the spacebar again or by clicking the 
time ruler at the top of the Timeline panel. The time ruler is the area where the Timeline’s time 
code appears.

When you previewed the fi le, you might have noti ced that the edit point, where the
shot of the reporter cuts to the bystander being interviewed, is rough. You will correct 
this in the next part of the lesson when you trim these clips in the Timeline panel.

Trimming clips on the Timeline
In this lesson, you began the editing process in the Source Monitor. There you trimmed 
your clips to eliminate excess and unnecessary footage. Once you add your clips to the 
Timeline, the true editing begins. The type of editing you do in the Timeline helps you 
judge how each clip relates to the other clips in your sequence, thus allowing you to refi ne
the rough edits you make when trimming clips in the Source Monitor.
In this part of the lesson, you will trim the beginning and end of the 
Bystander Interview 01-Subclip.mpeg and the Reporter at Crime Scene clip to 
refi ne the project.
1 
With the pr0401-working.prproj project still open and the Timeline panel active,
move the playhead to the 18-second and 20-frame (00:00:18:20) mark on the
Timeline. This is a good point in the clip at which to end it because it is a momentary 
pause in the character’s rant; and since he is moving around, this pause point fi ts with
the Cut on Action principle of continuity editing.
Click the current time fi eld in the upper-right side of the Timeline panel and type 1420 to jump to the 14-second and 
20-frame mark on the Timeline.
When working on your own projects, we strongly recommend that you play through the 
Timeline many times to determine the best edit point for your footage.

2 
Press the + sign on your keyboard three times to cause the Timeline panel to Zoom 
In on the current position of the playhead. Notice the small graph on the audio
track. This is called a waveform, and it displays the volume of a track over time. The 
playhead is currently positioned at a level point on the waveform, which represents a
point of silence, when the speaker is quiet. This point is usually the best place to cut a
clip, because it gives the illusion the speaker is taking a pause and has the most natural 
aff ect.
You might want to adjust the number of times you zoom in on the timeline depending on your 
monitor resolution. Additionally, you can adjust the height of a track by dragging the dividing 
line in the track header that separates the A1 and A2 tracks.
When trimming a clip, you must be careful to not cut too closely to where a person is starting or stopping while speaking.
3 
Click the – sign on the keyboard until you can see all three video clips visible in the 
Timeline panel, and then confi rm that the Selection tool is the active tool in the Tools
panel. Position your cursor at the end of the Bystander Interview 01-Subclip.mpeg
clip. Notice that the Selection tool changes to a Trim tool (
).
You can press the V key on your keyboard to activate the Selection tool.

Click the end of the clip with the Trim tool and drag it toward the playhead. The 
cursor automatically snaps to the playhead when it gets close. This trims the Out Point 
of the clip to match the current position of the playhead, but also leaves an empty 
space, called a gap, between the two clips. 
When trimming a clip, you must pay attention to the appearance of the cursor. This is how Premiere Pro tells you which tool 
variation you have active.
5 
Right-click the gap between the clips and choose Ripple Delete from the menu 
that appears. This clears the gap and shifts all of the clips that are to the right to 
compensate for the gap’s deletion.
6 
Now you want to trim the beginning of the same clip. Move the playhead to the 
10-second and 5-frame (00:00:10:05) mark on the Timeline. There is a little bit of 
hesitation in the beginning of the bystander’s rant, and it will make a better edit if we
remove it.
You can move your playhead on the Timeline manually by dragging it, but to move it precisely
one frame at a time, press the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.
You could use the Selection tool to trim the beginning of the clip, but as you learned 
previously, this would leave a gap between the two clips that you would then have
to remove. In the next step, you will use a tool that automatically removes gaps as it
trims your clips.
7 
Click the Ripple Edit tool on the Tools panel to activate it. If the Tools panel is not
visible, select Window > Tools.

Move the tool to the beginning of the Bystander Interview 01.mpeg clip and click
and drag it to the playhead to perform a ripple edit to the clip. Make sure the Ripple
Edit tool is facing the Playhead Position line before you begin to click and drag.
The keyboard shortcut to activate the Ripple Edit tool is B.
The tool appears to do nothing at all; but in fact, the entire clip moves automatically to the left to remove the gap created by
trimming the clip.
8 
Press the Home key on your keyboard or manually move the playhead to the 
beginning of the Timeline, and then press the spacebar to preview the edits in the 
Program Monitor.
9 
Move the playhead to the 1-second and 4-frame (00:00:01:04) mark on the Timeline.
Click and drag from the beginning of the clip toward the playhead to perform the
Ripple Edit. If you fi nd this diffi  cult, you can zoom in on the Timeline to make it 
easier to position the tool.
Again move the playhead to the beginning (00;00;00;00) of the Timeline and preview 
the edits in the Program Monitor by pressing the spacebar on your keyboard.
The edits seem more refi ned.

With the pr0401-working.prproj project still open, move the playhead to the
21-second and 20-frame (00:00:21:20) mark on the Timeline. 
When viewing clips on the Timeline, we recommend you zoom in and out frequently to have a better sense of how your clips
relate to each other.
You can zoom out on the Timeline to see the beginning and end of the Timeline simultaneously 
by pressing the – key, while pressing the + key zooms in on the Timeline.
2 
Click the Razor tool in the Tools pane to activate it. You can use the Razor tool to cut
or split clips to isolate the parts you want to keep.

The Razor tool cuts through the audio and video of a clip on the Timeline.
You can also cut a clip on the Timeline using both a menu command and a keyboard shortcut.
Choose Sequence > Add Edit or press Ctrl+K (Windows) or Command+K (Mac OS) to cut 
the clip on the active track at the current position of the playhead.
3 
Click the Selection tool in the Tools panel to activate it, and then click the second

Making an Insert edit
An Insert edit allows you to add a clip currently previewed in the Source Monitor to the 
Timeline, while simultaneously moving the clips already on the timeline to accommodate 
the new one. You completed a manual Insert edit earlier in the lesson by dragging footage 
onto the timeline; now you will do it again, this time using a button or keyboard shortcut. 
You can use an Insert edit to add a new clip to the Timeline at the beginning, end, or 
middle of clips currently on the Timeline. When you perform an Insert edit in the middle
of an existing clip, the command splits that clip and moves all adjacent clips to the right.
1 
With the pr0401-working.prproj project still open, double-click the
Crime Scene Tape.mpeg clip in the B Roll bin in the Project panel to preview it in 
the Source Monitor.
This clip is a just over nine seconds long; you will trim it down to use only the fi ve
seconds that include a left to right camera pan.
2 
In the Source Monitor, move the playhead to the 6-second mark (00;00;06;00) and 
click the Set In Point button or press the I key on your keyboard to mark the clip’s
new In Point at 6 seconds.
3 
Still in the Source Monitor, move the playhead to the 11-second mark (00;00;11;00) 
and click the Set Out Point button or press the O key on your keyboard to mark the 
clip’s new Out Point.
The color change in the Source panel lets you know that you have created In and 
Out points in your video clip.

Click the Timeline panel to activate it, and then, if necessary, move the playhead to
the beginning (00;00;00;00) of the Timeline.
Notice the V1 and A1 labels to the left of the A Roll audio and video tracks. These are 
called Source Track Indicators and correspond to the video and audio tracks of the clip
that is active in the Source Monitor.
The Source Track Indicators appear when a clip is active in the Source Monitor.

C
A. Source Track Indicators. B. Track Headers. C. Clips.
In a Premiere Pro Sequence, the number of audio and video tracks you start with is 
determined by the Sequence Preset you choose in the New Sequence dialog box, but you 
can have any number of separate audio and video tracks in a single sequence, provided that 
your computer system has enough available RAM to support them. To add tracks to the 
Timeline using keyboard shortcuts, the controls in the Source Monitor, or the copy and paste 
commands, you must specify a destination track. This is process is known as track targeting.
When you add clips to the Timeline panel by dragging them from the Source Monitor, the 
Project panel, or the Media browser, you automatically target a track by dropping the clip
onto that track. However, when you use the Source monitor controls, keyboard shortcuts, or 
copy and paste, you must specify a target track in advance. The placement of the Video and 
Audio target track selector in the Track Header area (where the track names are) indicates 
that a specifi c track is targeted and ready to receive clips. Depending on the properties of the
clip in the Source monitor, you can have more than one audio and video track targeted at
a time, or specify only a single audio or video track for targeting. For precise placement of 
content from the Source Monitor, you can map the tracks of the clip currently active in the 
Monitor to specifi c tracks on the Timeline by dragging the Source Track Indicators present
to the left of the Track Headers.

The video from the clip in the source monitor will be placed in the B-Roll track. 
Click the V1 Target Track selector and drag it to the V2 track, the one you earlier 
renamed B-Roll.
Click the A1 Target Track selector to disable it. This will allow you to insert only the 
video from the clip in the Source monitor.
You must target video and audio tracks on the Timeline when using the Insert and Overwrite commands.

With the Timeline panel still active, click the Insert button (
) on the Source 
Monitor or use the , (comma) shortcut key to perform an Insert edit. Notice that the
clip is added to the B-Roll track at the current position of the playhead and all the 
footage on the Timeline shifts to the right to accommodate it.
By using an Insert edit, you can increase the overall duration of the Timeline.

Review
Questions
1 
What is B Roll and how is it used?
2 
What is the diff erence between a cut-in and a cut-away?
3 
Why is it important or necessary to trim clips in the Timeline and not just in the
Source Monitor?
Answers
1 
B Roll footage is the secondary footage shot and used in video and fi lm productions. 
During the editing process, B Roll is used to add or enhance the meaning of the main 
footage or to cover the removal of unwanted or error-ridden material.
2 
A cut-in is a cut that shifts from the main subject (A Roll) to an event occurring inside
the same scene; a cut-away is a cut away from the main action to an event that occurs 
simultaneously.
3 
The  trimming done to clips in the Source Monitor usually results in rough edits. To 
refi ne an edit, you should see your clips on the Timeline to judge how each clip relates 
to the other clips in your sequence. It is easier to edit clips in the Timeline due to the 
specialized editing tools, such as the Ripple Edit tool, that can be used there.

Lesson 5, Using Video Transitions
What you’ll learn 
in this lesson:
• To add video transitions 
between clips on the 
Timeline
• To create a slideshow 
from still images
• To adjust preferences to 
set the default transition 
type and duration
Adding Transitions to Video
The cuts-only editing approach from the previous lesson is the 
standard for dramatic television and fi lm editing; however, you can 
use the transitions approach when you want to create a seamless 
blend from one video clip to another.
Starting up
In this lesson, you will work with the project fi les from the pr05lessons folder. Make sure
that you have loaded the prlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. The 
Starting up section at the beginning of this book provides detailed information about loading 
lesson fi les, resetting your workspace, locating missing media, and opening the fi les in CC. If 
you have not already done so, please review these instructions before starting this lesson.
When opening the Premiere Pro project fi les used in this lesson you may experience a missing 
media message. You must locate any missing media before trying to proceed through the 
lessons. Please refer to the “Locating missing media” in the Starting up section of this book.
See Lesson 5 in action!

 Understanding video transitions
A transition is a change or passage from one state or position to another. There are 
transitions for audio and video clips, but video transitions off er the greatest variety. In
modern non-linear video editing applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, you can add 
transitions between video and audio clips to ease the change from one image to another 
or from one situation to another. Premiere Pro off ers many diff erent types of transitions, 
including dissolves, wipes, and fades. Using a transition instead of a straight cut, as shown 
in the previous lesson, is often a stylistic choice to make the viewer more aware of the 
video, and draw them out of the story.
In high-end fi lm and television work, transitions are often avoided and cuts are are used 
in their place to move from one shot to another. However, even in this type of work, 
some transitions can be found. The three most commonly used transitions in this fi eld are 
dissolves, wipes, and fades.
Dissolves
The most popular type of dissolve is the Cross Dissolve, also called a Cross Fade. The
eff ect this type of dissolve produces is to fade out one video image as the next one fades
in and it is often used to aesthetically convey a sense that a long time or a great distance is 
passing. 
Wipes
Premiere Pro includes many diff erent types of wipes, such as iris wipes, gradient wipes, 
and push wipes. Wipes are often used to convey a sense of movement from one location to 
another, such as when a scene changes from an exterior to an interior shot. The “invisible 
wipe,” created while shooting, usually occurs when the camera follows the movement of 
an actor through a scene: when the camera passes in front of a wall, tree, or another fi gure, 
the editor can wipe to any other matching shot of the scene.

101
Lesson 5, Using Video Transitions

Fades to black or white
Fades to color are one of the most familiar transitions seen by viewers. A fade is created 
when the opacity of the video image is reduced to reveal a solid color (usually black or 
white) behind it. Fades are often used as a stylistic tool or to signify a major change; for 
example, a fade to black is often used to signify the end of a scene or fi lm and transition
into the credits. 
Adding transitions to video clips
You can add a transition to any pair of video clips on the same tra ck, but we strongly
recommend you add them to trimmed clips because transitions extend beyond the end of 
the fi rst clip and begin before the beginning of the second clip. If the beginning and end 
of the respective clips are not trimmed, the transition automatically creates a freeze frame. 
In this part of the lesson, you will work with an existing project: you will prepare a pair 
of fi les to receive a transition, add them to the Timeline, and then add a Cross Dissolve
transition between them.
All the media for this exercise can be found in the Media Library. It is located in the Video 
sub-folder of the Travelogue-Boston folder.
1 
With Premiere Pro open, chose File > Open Project. Navigate to the pr05lessons 
folder that you copied to your hard drive and locate the pr0501.prproj fi le. Double-
click the fi le to open it.
If you are at the Premiere Pro welcome screen, you can simply choose the 
Open Project link.This project contains one sequence named Working with 
Transitions and two pieces of media: Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge.MTS and
Cars on Bridge.MTS.
The default Editing workspace and the modifi ed one you created in an earlier exercise
are both geared toward adding clips to the timeline and editing them there. Because 
you will be working primarily with adding and editing clip transitions in this lesson, a 
change is in order.
2 
Choose Window > Workspace > Eff ects to change your current workspace to the 
preset Eff ects workspace built into the application. 
If you have previously used this workspace, it may appear diff erent than its default 
confi guration; you can correct this by resetting the workspace.

Preparing a clip to receive transitions
As mentioned previously, for the best eff ect when using transitions, clips should have
trimmed beginning or end points. This is why we recommend that you include handles
when capturing footage. Handles are extra footage at the beginning and end of the clip
or scene with which you want to work. Many videographers begin recording before the 
action they want to capture begins, and continue the recording until after it is over just to
make sure they will have handles.
In this section of the lesson, you will trim the two clips in the Source Monitor to prepare
them for the dissolve you will add later.
1 
With the pr0501-working.prproj project still open, double-click the
Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge.MTS clip in the Project panel to open it in the
Source Monitor.
This clip is currently 9 seconds long. There is footage that you don’t need at the 
beginning of the clip, which is used to establish the shot. There is also footage towards 
the end of the clip, where the camera work gets a little shaky. Trimming this clip
will accomplish two goals: it will make the shot tighter and more succinct, and it will 
provide us with the trimmed clips that make transitions run more smoothly.

Move the Source Monitor playhead to the 2-second (00;00;02;00) mark on the time 
ruler; click the Mark In button at the bottom left of the Source Monitor to set the In
Point of the clip to the current position of the playhead. Since this is a static shot of the 
bridge, removing the fi rst couple of seconds will eliminate some redundant footage.
The playhead position can be set by dragging it, typing in the playhead position fi eld, or using keyboard shortcuts.
To move the playhead to an exact location on the time ruler, click the Playhead
Position fi eld to make it active, type the time code location where you want to 
position the playhead, and then press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key 
on your keyboard. If you do not want to type the time code location, you can type
the numerals of the location without the semicolons; for example, 300 is equal to
the 3-second (00;00;03;00) mark on the Timeline, while 10 is equivalent to the 10th
frame (00;00;00;10) mark.

The camera begins to get a little shaky slightly after the 7-second (00:00:07:00) mark
on the timeline, so this will be a good point to end the clip.
Click the Playhead Position fi eld in the Source Monitor to make it active, replace the 
current time (00:00:02:00) with the number 700, and then press the Enter (Windows) 
or Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to jump the playhead to the 7-second
(00:00:07:00) mark on the clip’s time ruler.
It isn’t necessary to include the colons when typing a time value into the Playhead Position 
fi eld. The application will automatically assume the proper breaks for frames, seconds, minutes,
and hours.
4 
Click the Mark Out button (it is located right next to the Mark In button in the 
Source Monitor). This sets the Out point of the clip to the current position of the 
playhead.
In and Out points can also be set using the “I” and “O” keys respectively.

the trimmed clip to the Timeline in the V1 and A1 tracks.
The Timeline playhead automatically moves to the end of the clip when you perform an insert or overwrite edit.
Since this is the fi rst clip you add to the Timeline, it doesn’t matter whether you use an insert or 
overwrite edit here. Both would have the exact same result.

This clip is a shot of the same bridge, but off ers more focus on the automobiles that are
on the roadway. Like the previous clip, it has some redundant footage at the beginning 
and is a bit shaky towards the end.
Click in the Playhead Position fi eld to make it active, and type 200 to replace the
current value. Press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard;
this moves the playhead to the 2-second (00:00:02:00) mark on the clip’s time ruler.

You might fi nd it necessary to adjust the magnifi cation of the Timeline panel to see 
your clips and how they relate to each other more clearly. The controls to zoom in or 
out on the Timeline panel are integrated into the panel’s horizontal slider. Simply click
and drag on either button located at the ends of the slider.

Click and drag on either end of the slider to set the Timeline’s magnifi cation to a level 
that is comfortable to you. For this lesson, you will need to be able to see the ends of 
both clips and the edit line between them.
The horizontal slider in the Timeline panel can be used to change the magnifi cation of the panel.
The keyboard shortcuts to zoom in and out on the Timeline panel are the plus (+) and 
minus (-) keys located at the top of a standard keyboard.

You can adjust the default track display to suit your preferences. Position your cursor 
in the Track header between the V1 and V2 tracks. When you hover over the dividing 
line between them, the cursor becomes a double-headed vertical arrow ( ). Click and 
draw with this arrow to enlarge the height of the V1 Track until it is approximately 
twice its original size.
When tracks are maximized, you can see a thumbnail image of each video clip.

In the search fi eld at the top of the Eff ects panel, type the word cross. 
Typing a word in the search fi eld reveals every eff ect and transition with that word in
its title; in this case, the Cross Dissolve and Iris Cross transitions are revealed. 
The search fi eld is helpful when you know the name or part of the name 
of the eff ect you want to use.
The list of eff ects may vary slightly on the Windows and Mac OS platforms.

Click the Cross Dissolve transition and drag it to the edit line between the two clips
on the Timeline. When your cursor is hovering on the edit line between two video 
clips, the area becomes highlighted to indicate you can release the transition at that 
location.
You must carefully place the transition on the Timeline to ensure you position it at the edit line between the clips.
You can place a transition at the end of the fi rst clip, at the beginning of the second clip, or in
between the clips on the edit line. Each of these three areas becomes highlighted when you try to 
position the transition and each produces a diff erent result in the fi nal appearance of the project.

Notice the small red bar that appears at the top of the Timeline above the transition. It 
indicates that the transition must be rendered in order to preview at full quality in real 
time.
Depending on your system confi guration, you will fi nd that most of the eff ects and transitions you add to the Timeline must be 
rendered to preview at full quality.

Editing transition settings
When a transition is applied to clips, it is applied with the transition’s default settings; 
however, you can adjust the properties of all transitions to achieve the eff ect you want. All 
transitions have certain unique properties, but all share position and duration attributes.
1 
Continuing with the pr0501-working.prproj project from the previous lesson, drag 
the playhead to the cross dissolve transition, on the edit line between the two clips.
Press and hold the Shift key while dragging the playhead to force it to snap to the edges of clips
and transitions.
Depending on your monitor resolution, you might need to zoom in on the Timeline 
to enlarge the clips and make the transition easier to see. Remember that when you 
zoom in on the timeline, the application focuses the zoom on the playhead location.
The current zoom state of the Timeline does not use a numerical value; you must adjust it until you are comfortable with how you 
see the clips.

The Cross Dissolve has four sets of properties: Duration, Alignment, and Start and 
End blending amount.
Select the Show Actual Sources check box at the bottom of the properties to change 
the generic A and B icons in the Start and End fi elds and show the actual video from
the clips you are using. 
All transitions have Duration and Alignment properties; however, each can have other unique properties.
The Eff ect Controls panel is divided in two sections: the left side of the panel shows 
the properties of the transition with which you are working; the right shows a mini-
Timeline view to let you see the eff ect of any changes. The display of the Timeline 
view shows the fi rst clip on the track above and the second clip on the track below, 
in an older A/B track display. Both tracks are separated by a third transition track
holding the Cross Dissolve. The display is a legacy of older editing systems and is now 
rarely seen in Premiere Pro or any other modern non-linear editing application.

In the Eff ect Controls panel, click the Duration value, change the current duration to
200, and then press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard 
to set the transition’s new duration to 2 seconds (00;00;02;00).
Any change you make to the properties of a transition is immediately visible in the Timeline view of the Eff ect Controls panel.
The other two properties available to you with a Cross Dissolve are Alignment and
the Start and Ending blend. The Alignment property lets you change the transition 
to the end of the fi rst clip, the beginning of the second clip, or centered on the edit
line. Each produces diff erent eff ects in how the two video images blend together. By 
default, this transition begins with the fi rst clip fully visible and ends with the second
clip fully visible to create the impression that one image fades into the next. However, 
you can change this eff ect by adjusting the Start and End blending amounts so the 
starting or ending images of transition are a blend of the two clips.
If you just want to edit the duration of a transition without viewing its other properties, 
double-click the transition in the Timeline. This will open a Set Transition Duration dialog box
for your editing convienence.

 Creating an image slideshow
You can create slideshows that combine a series of diff erent images or videos together 
for artistic or educational purposes and even set them to music. In Premiere Pro, you can 
rapidly add a sequence of images to the Timeline and automatically insert a transition
between each. To create the slideshow, you will set the default video transition and then
use a command named Automate to Sequence to add the images to the Timeline. 
In this section of the lesson, you will work with the pr0502.prproj project fi le. A series of 
still images you can use in the slideshow have already been imported and an NTSC format 
sequence has been created. The image fi les for completing this exercise can be found in 
the Safari folder located inside the Media Library folder.
1 
Choose File > Open Project, navigate to the pr05lessons folder that you copied to 
your hard drive, and then open the pr0502.prproj project fi le.
You should now be in the Editing workspace. If necessary, reset this workspace to its
default confi guration by choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace. 
When you want to create a slideshow like this, we recommend that you organize the 
images or videos you want to use in the Project panel fi rst, and then add them to the 
Timeline in a batch. This speeds up the slideshow creation process and also allows you
to transition between each slide automatically.

At this point, the fl oating panel uses the same list view display that the Project panel 
did. This view, while helpful in some situations, does not let you organize media 
outside of a rigid hierarchical format and isn’t appropriate if you want to visually sort 
your clips.
Click the Icon View button located at the bottom left corner of the bin’s fl oating 
panel. Again, you might need to resize the panel to accommodate all of the clip 
thumbnails.
In the icon view, you can resize the panel to view more thumbnails.
The Icon View is used to arrange your clips based on their content so you can quickly 
assemble a rough edit that you can fi ne tune later in the Timeline. This type of display 
is also known as a storyboard view.
When working with the Project panel in the Icon View display mode, you change the
order of clips by clicking on them and dragging the clip to a new location.

Click the fi rst fi le in the bin hut.jpg, press and hold the Shift key on your keyboard, 
and then click the last fi le in the bin cheetahface04.jpg to select all images between 
them.
Pressing and holding Shift allows you to select a group of sequential fi les; pressing and holding the Control (Windows) or 
Command (Mac OS) key allows you to select multiple fi les that are non-sequential.
3 
Choose Clip > Automate to Sequence to open the Automate to Sequence dialog box.
The dialog box controls the options used when you add the selected images to the 
Timeline.
Ordering: you can set this property to Sort Order or Selection Order. The Sort 
Order option uses the arrangement of clips in the bin to control how they are placed 
on the Timeline. Selection Order requires that you select each clip individually using 
the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to control the 
order in which you add them to the Timeline.
Placement: you can set this property to Sequentially or At Unnumbered Markers. If 
you created unnumbered markers and added them to the Timeline, the latter choice 
will be active; this option is helpful for controlling the placement of the footage items. 
Without markers, the Sequential Placement option positions the diff erent footage 
items next to each other on the Timeline, starting with the fi rst one at the current 
position of the playhead.
Method: specifi es whether to use an Overwrite or Insert edit to add the footage items 
to the Timeline. The option is irrelevant if there are no other clips present on the
Timeline.

Clip Overlap: specifi es the duration to overlap each clip you are adding to the
Timeline. The value for Clip Overlap is applied at the beginning and end of each clip 
and shortens the clip’s duration.
Still Clip Duration: allows you to specify how still images are treated when added to 
the Timeline. You can either use the specifi ed In/Out Range of the clips, or override it 
by settting a specifi c number of frames to assign as the duration for each image.
There are also two sets of options that allow you to control whether the default audio 
and video transition are applied between each clip and whether you would like to 
ignore the audio or video sections of the selected clips.
4 
Set the following values in the Automate To Sequence dialog box:
Ordering: Sort Order
Placement: Sequentially
Method: Overwrite Edit
Clip Overlap: 30 Frames
Still Clip Duration: Us In/Out Range
Confi rm that the check boxes for applying the default audio and video transitions are 
enabled and that the check box to ignore video is disabled.
The Automate To Sequence command is the quickest method for creating 
image or video slideshows.
Click the OK button to add the selected images to the Timeline.

in order to preview in real time and at full quality.
Click the Timeline panel to make it active, and then press the Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to render all areas of the Timeline that need
rendering.
When the rendering is done, the application automatically shows a preview of the

You must always render images that you add to video sequences in Premiere Pro before you can
preview them in real time and at full quality.
6 
Now that you have added the images to the Timeline, notice that each image and 
transition is separate and individual from each other. You can now edit the transitions
separately; you can even substitute one transition for another by simply dragging it
from the Eff ects panel until it overlaps the current one on the Timeline.
You might need to zoom in on your Timeline to see the clips and transitions more 
clearly.
The Automate to Sequence command is the only way to automatically add transitions between multiple clips on the Timeline.

Questions
1 
What is the purpose of applying a transition between clips in the Timeline?
2 
Where are transitions placed?
3 
When using the Automate to Sequence command, what is the purpose of the
Ordering property?
Answers
1 
Transitions are added between video and audio clips to ease the change from one
image to another or from one situation to another. They are often used as a stylistic
choice that makes the viewer more aware of the video they are watching.
2 
Transitions are placed between a pair of adjacent clips on the Timeline. Transitions 
can be positioned at the end of the fi rst clip, at the beginning of the second clip, or 
centered on the edit line between the clips.
3 
You can set the Ordering property to Sort Order or Selection  Order. The sort order 
option uses the arrangement of clips in the bin to control how they are placed on the 
Timeline. Selection Order requires that you select each clip individually using the
Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to control the
order you add them to the Timeline.

Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Creating titles in Premiere Pro
You can create three types of titles using the tools built into Premiere Pro: stills, rolls, and 
crawls. Still titles consist of static text and graphics, and as such, they are the simplest titles 
to create. Once you have created static titles using the title tools in Premiere Pro, you can
animate them on the Timeline as you would any imported graphic.
Rolling titles consist of blocks of text that extend past the bottom of the video frame, and 
are commonly used for ending credits. Rolling titles animate automatically when you 
place them on the Timeline.
Crawling titles consist of long text blocks that extend past the right and left edges of the
video frame. This type of title is commonly used in specialized cases, for example, news 
programs, or to simulate stock or news tickers.

Using the Titler
In Premiere Pro, the term Titler refers to the group of interrelated panels you can use
to create text and titles. The panels you can use to create titles are: Title Actions, Title 
Designer, Title Properties, Title Styles, and Title Tools.
D
A
B
C
E
A. Title Actions. B. Title Tools. C. Title Designer. D. Title Properties. E. Title Styles.
Title Actions: this panel contains the commands to align and distribute the text
and graphics you create in the Titler. The Align command becomes active when you 
simultaneously select two or more objects; the Distribute command becomes active when 
you select three or more objects.
Title Designer: this is the central panel of the Titler, and it is the panel where you can 
add and manipulate the text and graphics for your title. The Title Designer automatically 
displays the video frame at the current position of the playhead in the Timeline panel.
Title Properties: this panel displays the properties of the object currently selected in the 
Title Designer. Depending on what type of object you have selected, this panel will give
you diff erent sets of options. The Title Properties panel is used to review and edit item 
properties and is one of the main areas of focus when using the Titler. 
Title Styles: this panel contains the library of text styles you can access in the Titler. Use 
this panel to apply any of the preset styles available for Premiere Pro. You can also save 
custom styles from the text you format in the Titler.

132
Using the Titler
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom

Title Tools: this panel contains tools you need to create the text and graphics for your 
titles. The panel contains a variety of text tools, as well as tools for creating both simple 
and complex shapes.
Understanding the safe zones
The safe zone margins are enabled by default; you can disable them from the context menu of the Title Designer.
There are two sets of margins that defi ne the safe zones in the Title Designer panel: the inner 
gray rectangle designates the title-safe margin, while the outer gray rectangle indicates the 
action-safe margins of the video frame.
Safe zones are useful when you edit video or produce graphics that will be displayed on a 
television screen. Most television sets perform a function called over scanning on the video
frame. As a result of this over scanning process, the outer edges of the picture could be placed
outside the viewable area of the screen. Since the amount of over scanning is not consistent
between diff erent devices, the safe zones are a general guideline to help ensure that all the 
important information in a video frame is visible. We recommend you keep all text inside the
title safe margin, since it represents the center 80% of the video frame. You can keep other 
important elements inside the action safe margin, which represents the center 90% of the
available screen space.

Creating a lower third
The purpose of Lower Thirds is to add on-screen text that explains some aspect of the
video. The most common use of lower thirds is to introduce individuals or settings in 
documentary-style projects. As the name suggests, lower thirds appear in the lower third 
of the video frame.
The media for this project can all be found in the Media Library.
The video fi les (Central Park-NYC-Fountain Scene.AVI and
Central Park-NYC-Lake Scene.AVI) used here are located in the Travelogue-New
York folder while the audio fi le (Classical Background Music.mp3) is located in the 
Audio folder.
In this part of the lesson, you will create a lower third to introduce a setting changed in a
documentary-style travelogue.
1 
With Premiere Pro open, chose File > Open Project. Navigate to the pr06lessons 
folder that you copied to your hard drive, and locate the pr0601.prproj fi le. Double-
click the fi le to open it. 
This project contains a sequence with clips on the Timeline and a background audio 
track. You need a lower third to establish the setting for the clips. If necessary, move
the playhead to the beginning (00;00;00;00) of the Timeline.
2 
Choose Title > New Title > Default Still. Even though you are creating a still image 
title, it still has to be assigned a duration. All titles you create in the Titler are assigned
the default still image duration; 150 frames. Keep in mind you can change this value
in the General category of the Preferences dialog box at any time, though it will only 
aff ect titles created after the change is made.
In the New Title dialog box that appears, confi rm that the settings of the new title
conform to those of the project:
Width: 1280
Height: 720
Time base: 23.976 fps
Pixel Aspect Ratio: Square Pixels (1.0)
You can change the default still image duration in the General category of the Preferences dialog box.

When you create a new title, its properties default to match the 
settings of your current sequence.
Once you click OK, the title you have just created immediately appears as a new item in the 
Project panel.
4 
If necessary, expand the Titler by dragging its lower-right corner to see all fi ve panels
simultaneously. If you prefer, you can also expand the Titler to full screen size using 
the buttons at the top of the panel.
5 
Choose File > Save As. In the Save Project dialog box that appears, confi rm that you 
are still in the pr06lessons folder, rename your fi le to pr0601-working, and then click
Save. 
Keep the fi le open; you will need it in the next part of this lesson where you will add
text and graphics to create your lower third.
Adding text to the Titler
Titles can contain any combination of text, graphics, and images; however, text generally 
is the most important element. Working with text in the Titler is similar to working with 
text in other graphics applications, such as Photoshop and Illustrator.
In this part of the lesson, you will add the text to the default still title that you created in
the previous part of the lesson.
1 
With the pr0601-working.prproj project still open, confi rm that the playhead is at 
the origin (00;00;00;00) point of the Timeline.
If necessary, move the Titler to another location on your computer screen to view the Timeline panel.

F
A
C
E
A. Type Tool. 
B. Vertical Type Tool. 
C. Area Type Tool.
D. Vertical Area Type tool. 
E. Path Type tool.
F. Vertical Path Type tool.
Type tool & Vertical Type tool: the Type Tool creates horizontal lines of text you
can read from left to right; the Vertical Type tool creates vertical lines of text you can 
read from top to bottom. To use these tools, you do not need to create a boundary
text frame, just click the drawing area where you want the text to appear, and then
type the text.
Area Type tool & Vertical Area Type tool: unlike text created with the Type
tools, the text created with the Area and Vertical Area Type tools is constrained to a
boundary text frame. To create the boundary text frame, click and drag these tools 
where you want the text to appear, and then type your text. The text automatically
wraps to form new lines when it reaches the boundary of the text box.
Path Type tool & Vertical Path Type tool: the Path Type tools allow you to 
create a curved path to then create the text that follows it. Using these tools is very
similar to using the Pen tool in graphics applications such as Photoshop and Illustrator. 
To create the curved path, click the drawing area at the point you want your text to
start. Then click and drag to create the second point and continue clicking until you
have created the path you want. Once you have completed the path, type your text
and it will automatically conform to the contour of the path.

Locate the Fill property group in the Title Properties panel and set the Fill Type to 
Linear Gradient. This will add several new properties that specifi cally deal with the 
properties of this type of gradient to the fi ll group.
Each Fill Type in the Fill Property group has specifi c properties
associated with it.
5 
Located right below the Fill Type menu, the Color property has changed from a
simple color swatch into a gradient slider. The two color boxes at the bottom of the
slider are called gradient color stops. 
Drag each so the fi rst color stop is on the absolute-left of the slider and the second is 
on the absolute-right.

Double-click the fi rst color stop to open a color picker and set the RGB values to 
R:80, G:80, B:80 to produce a dark gray color; click OK to close the color picker and 
set the value of this color stop. 
Graphics and Titles for video are always created in the RGB color mode.
The Color Picker in Premiere Pro is similar to that used in other Adobe applications. You can 
input color values in a variety of diff erent color modes: HSB (Hue Saturation Brightness), HSL 
(Hue Saturation Lightness), RGB (Red Green Blue), YUV, and Hexadecimal code. You can also
set color manually by selecting a Hue (color) from the vertical slider and then clicking the square 
color selector to set a saturation and brightness for the new color.

Formatting text
You can format entire text boxes at once for convenience, but for greater control and
creativity, you have the power to control the formatting of individual letters, words, and
lines of type.
1 
With the pr0601-working.prproj project still open, if necessary, click the Selection
tool in the Title Tools panel to activate it.
2 
With the Selection tool active, double-click the text box in the Title Designer panel. 
This selects the text frame automatically and activates the Type tool so you can select 
and edit individual text elements.
Using the Type tool in this way is similar to creating text in a word processing application. You
can click inside the text box to move the text cursor, double-click to select a word, and click and 
drag to select a range of text.
3 
Click and drag the Type tool to select the second line of text.
When used inside a text box, the Type tool functions in much the same way as a mouse cursor in a word 
processing program such as Microsoft Word.

With the second line of text still selected, locate the Fill property group, and then 
change the Fill Type property to Solid.
Click the swatch to the right of the Color property to open the Color Picker panel and
change the color value to R:0, G:0, B:0 to produce a solid black; click OK to confi rm 
the color change.

Outer Stroke that you applied in the previous section of the lesson. Select the fi rst line 
of text. Notice that the Fill and Stroke properties now refl ect the appearance of this 
text. These setting will become the appearance settings for the next object you create.
Be careful when applying a stroke to text. It can sometimes make the text more diffi  cult to read.
7 
Click the Selection tool in the Title Tools panel and then click anywhere in the Title
Designer panel to remove the highlighting around the second line of text.
Notice that this line of text is diffi  cult to read because the black is too close to the
colors in the background video. You will fi x this in the next step by adding a color 
box behind the text.

Creating shapes
Text placed directly on top of an image is often very diffi  cult to read, whether the image
comes from video or is a still image. To compensate, we recommend you place a color 
fi eld behind the text to help make it more readable.
1 
With the pr0601-working.prproj project still open, click the Rectangle tool in the
Title Tools panel to make it active.
2 
With the Rectangle tool, click and drag from the left side of the screen to create a 
rectangle that covers the lower third of the video frame. This covers the text that you 
created in the previous parts of this lesson. The appearance of the rectangle you have 
just created will be taken from appearance settings of the last object you had selected 
in the Titler. So depending on the text you selected when you used the Rectangle 
tool, you could end up with a black box or a box with a gradient fi ll.
When you work in the Titler, any new object you create is always placed in front of the other objects in the 
Title Designer panel. New objects also take on the appearance of the last object you created.
We recommend you extend the rectangle outside the Video Frame in the Title Designer panel to
guarantee the color fi eld extends to the absolute edge of the video screen, even on devices that do 
not use over scanning, such as computer monitors.

to have transparency and a high quality color display.
3 
With the Selection tool still active, click the center of the image and drag it into
toward the bottom of the video frame so it is adjacent to the text.
Any object selected in the Title Designer panel has a rectangular bounding box around it that you can use 
to transform (move, rotate, or scale) the selected object.

when you place it just above the control point (the small dark square). This tool
indicates that you can rotate the selected object.
To rotate the image counter-clockwise, click and drag the tool slightly to the left.
When working in Premiere Pro, the cursor is context sensitive. It changes appearance to show you it can perform
a new function.
If you want to rotate an object by a specifi c amount, you can set a value for the Rotation property 
of any selected object in the Title Properties panel.

Creating an ending credit roll
As mentioned earlier in this book, you can create more than simple, still titles. Rolling 
Titles are often used to create the ending credits you see in fi lm and television programs. 
While the fi rst rolling titles were created by painting text onto panes of glass and moving 
them past a camera vertically, you can now accomplish the same eff ect much easier using 
Premiere Pro.

All titles you create in the Titler are assigned the default still image duration; 150 frames 
(5 seconds at 30 fps). Keep in mind you can change this value in the General category of 
the Preferences dialog box at any time, though it will only aff ect titles created after the 
change is made. This eff ect is not retroactive; changing this particular preference will 
only aff ect titles created and still images imported after you have made the change. When
working with a credit roll, the speed of the title’s movement is based on the duration of the
title itself.

Working with Photoshop fi les
In some productions, it is common to display the production company’s logo after the
ending credits. In this section of the lesson, you are going to create your own logo by 
animating a layered Photoshop fi le.
All the media used in this section of the lesson can be found in the Images sub-folder of 
the Media Library.
1 
With Premiere Pro open, chose File > Open Project. Navigate to the pr06lessons 
folder that you copied to your hard drive and locate the pr0603.prproj fi le.
Double - click the fi le to open it. 
This project contains a standard 1920× 1080 high-defi nition sequence with a static
image fi le already on the Timeline. You will import and animate a layered Photoshop
fi le in the next subsections.
2 
Choose File > Save As. In the Save Project dialog box that appears, confi rm that you
are still in the pr06lesson folder, rename your fi le to pr0603-working, and then click 
the Save button.
Don’t close this fi le; you will need it to complete the rest of this lesson.

Importing layered Photoshop fi les
Photoshop has a layers feature that works in much the same way as the video track you see 
in Premiere Pro. Layers allow you to stack diff erent images on top of one another, just as
you created a lower-third and placed it above a video clip.
When working with layered Photoshop fi les, Premiere Pro can import a fl attened
composite image, or convert the fi le to a sequence and import each layer as an individual 
footage item. This type of import is helpful when you want to animate each layer 
individually, as explained in the next procedure.
1 
With the pr0603-working.prproj project still open, choose File > Import, and in 
the Import dialog box, navigate to the Media Library folder located in the project fi les
folder that you copied to your hard drive. 
In the Media Library folder, locate the Images folder and double-click the
Bad Robot Productions.psd fi le.
You can open the Import dialog box in several ways. The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+I (Windows)
or Command+I (Mac OS). You can also right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) the 
Project panel and choose Import from the menu that appears, or double-click any empty area of 
the Project panel to open the dialog box.
2 
Importing a layered Photoshop fi le opens a secondary dialog box that you can use to 
set the options for how to import the fi le. In the Import As menu choose Sequence.
This imports each layer individually and adds them to a new sequence. The sequence
feature is helpful in cases where all the elements in the Photoshop fi le are positioned 
where you need them.

Lesson 6, Working with Graphics
6
Confi rm that all the layer check boxes are selected and that the Footage Dimensions 
are set to Document Size. Click the OK button to import the layered fi le and create a
new sequence to match its properties.
Importing a Photoshop fi le as a sequence allows you to work with
each layer of the fi le individually.
The other choices in the Import As menu are helpful in diff erent situations. The Merge All Layers 
option imports the layered Photoshop fi le as a fl attened image and is very similar to importing 
a TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) fi le. The 
Merged Layers option works almost as the fi rst choice, but it allows you to specify which layers of 
the Photoshop fi le to merge together. Finally, the individual Layers option imports each layer as 
an individual footage item, but does not create a sequence for them.
3 
When you click OK, a new bin appears in the Project panel. It contains the individual 
footage items for each layer and the sequence that was created to contain them. Click 
on the reveal triangle to the left of the new folder to see its contents.

The new sequence that was created when you imported the Photoshop Document is 
named Bad Robot Productions. Click this new sequence to select it. Notice that it 
has a duration of 5 seconds (00;00;05;00). The duration is caused by the fact that all
the image layers in the sequence are set to be 5 seconds each. By default, this is the 
duration used for all imported still images.
The new sequence and all media associated with it are grouped together for easy access.
4 
Double-click the new sequence to make it active and open it in the Timeline panel.
Then in the Bad Robot Productions Timeline, click either end of the Horizontal 
Slider at the bottom of the panel and drag it until you see the 5-second (00;00;05;00)
mark visible on the Timeline. You will want to adjust the Timeline magnifi cation 
until you can comfortably see both the beginning and end of the clips.
The amount you have to zoom in depends on your monitor’s resolution.
5 
Choose File > Save or press Ctrl+S (Windows) or Command+S (Mac OS) to save 
these changes to your project. Do not close this fi le; you will need it in the next part 
of the lesson when you animate the individual Photoshop layers on the Timeline.

Animating the position of clips
169
Lesson 6, Working with Graphics
6
Animating the position of clips
You can perform simple animation tasks in Premiere Pro by creating keyframes, which 
store property values at diff erent positions on the Timeline. To create animation, you
set two or more keyframes where a property’s values are diff erent, and the program
automatically interprets the change in value. This interpretation, which is called
interpolation, is how the majority of computer-based animation is created.
Please note that for more complex and detailed animation tasks you will want to use a 
dedicated video animation program such as Adobe After Eff ects.
1 
With the pr0603-working.prproj project still open, confi rm that the Bad Robot 
Productions sequence is active in the Timeline panel.
Double-clicking any sequence in the Project panel automatically opens it in the Timeline panel 
and makes it the active sequence.
2 
The sequence consists of fi ve video tracks each with one clip on it. If you expand 
the track headers, you will notice that each track name matches the name of the clip 
on that track. Both are taken from the original Photoshop layer name. The clips are
stacked from top to bottom as follows (the list uses only the clip’s layer names from 
Photoshop, not the full fi le address name assigned to each track):
Frame, robotHead, Text-Robot, Text-Bad, and Text-Productions
Click the clip second from bottom named Text-Bad to select it and make it active.
3 
When a clip is selected, its properties become accessible through the Eff ect Controls 
panel.
Click the tab for the Eff ect Controls panel to make it active and bring it to the front of 
the panel display.
In the default Editing workspace the Eff ect Controls panels is grouped with the Source Monitor.
Notice that the clip has three inherent sets of properties: Motion, Opacity, and Time
Remapping. For this clip, you will be working with the Motion property group.
The Eff ects Controls panel displays and edits the inherent properties of clips and the properties of any Eff ects attached to them.

Click the reveal triangle to the left of the Motion Property group to show the fi ve 
properties: Position, Scale, Rotation, Anchor Point, and Anti-Flicker Filter.
The Eff ect Controls panel has two parts; the left side holds the eff ects you can edit while the 
right side is a mini-timeline view. You can adjust size of either side by placing your cursor over the 
barely visible dividing line between the two sections until it become a double-headed arrow. Drag 
the arrow cursor left or right to adjust the panel.
For this project, you will create a 2-second animation in which the text fl ies into view
from the top of the screen. This requires you to animate the Position property of the
clip. Since we already have the text in its fi nal resting position, we will create the 
ending keyframe fi rst and then create the keyframe where the clips is off -screen.
First, set the key frame that positions the text at the end of the 2-second animation:
In the Timeline panel, move the playhead to the 2-second (00;00;02;00) mark. This
also moves the playhead in the mini-timeline view in the Eff ect Controls panel.
The Eff ect Controls panel’s Timeline view mirrors the main Timeline display.
You should create the last key frame fi rst because the graphic is imported as a sequence; therefore, 
all the content is already at the fi nal position. It creates less work to set the fi nal key frame fi rst 
and then work back to create the animation and ensure you do not accidentally move the logo 
from its intended layout.

5 
Click the Toggle Animation stopwatch icon to the left of the Position property to 
enable animation for this single property. This creates a key frame that stores the
property’s current value at the playhead’s current position. 
The Toggle Animation stopwatch automatically creates a keyframe where the playhead currently is.
6 
Move the playhead back to the beginning (00;00;00;00) of the Timeline, and then in
the Eff ect Controls panel, change the second value of the position property (this is the 
clip’s vertical position) to 0.0 by clicking the current value to make it editable. This 
positions it at the top of the video frame outside of the visible area of the screen. 
You can see any changes you make to the properties of a clip on the Timeline in the Program Monitor.
Press the spacebar on your keyboard to see the animation you have created play in the
Program Monitor. You can press the spacebar again at any time to stop the playback.
7 
Move the playhead to the 2-second (00;00;02;00) mark on the Timeline and click the 
Text-Robot clip to make it active so you can view its properties in the Eff ect Controls 
panel.

Again click the reveal triangle next to the Motion property group in the Eff ect
Controls panel, and then click the Toggle Animation stopwatch next to the Position 
property to create the fi rst key frame at 2 seconds and enable animation.
The Eff ect Controls panel shows you the properties for the selected and current clip.
8 
Move the playhead back to the beginning (00;00;00;00) of the Timeline, and change 
the Position property’s fi rst value (this is the clip’s horizontal position) to 1800 to 
move it outside the right boundary of the screen.
We strongly recommend you move the playhead to the correct time code position before changing a property value. Keyframes are 
created only at the current position of the playhead.
Press the spacebar on your keyboard to see the animation you have created play in the 
Program Monitor. Stop the playback when you are satisfi ed with what you have seen
by pressing the spacebar again.
9 
Once again move the playhead to the 2-second (00;00;02;00) mark on the Timeline, 
and then click the Text-Productions clip to make it active and reveal its properties in
the Eff ect Controls panel.

Again click the reveal triangle next to the Motion property group, and then click the
Toggle Animation stopwatch next to the Position property to create a key frame at 
2 seconds and enable animation.
If you have your clips assembled in the correct position, it is often most effi  cient to create the fi nal keyframe of the animation fi rst.
10 Move the playhead back to the beginning (00;00;00;00) of the Timeline and change
the position property’s second value to 1000.0 to move it off  the bottom boundary of 
the screen.
Press the spacebar on your keyboard to see the animation you have created play in the
Program Monitor. Stop the playback when you are satisfi ed with what you have seen
by pressing the spacebar again.
11 Choose File > Save or press Ctrl+S (Windows) or Command+S (Mac OS) to save
these changes to your project. Do not close this fi le; you will need it in the next part 
of the lesson when you animate the opacity properties of the two remaining clips.
Animating the opacity of clips
You can animate any property of a clip. In the previous portion of this lesson, you
animated the Position of the fi rst three clips to create a fl y-in animation where the text 
begins off -screen and fl ies on to reveal itself. You will now animate the Opacity property 
of the remaining two clips to complete the animated logo.
1 
With the pr0603-working.prproj project still open, confi rm that the Bad Robot 
Productions sequence is active in the Timeline panel.
2 
Move the playhead to the 2-second (00;00;02;00) mark on the Timeline, and in the 
Timeline panel, click the robotHead clip to make it active and reveal its properties in
the Eff ect Controls panel.
Click the reveal triangle next to the Opacity property group. This process is slightly
diff erent from what you have done previously because the Opacity property’s Toggle 
Animation switch is already enabled by default so you don’t have to turn it on.

174
Animating the opacity of clips
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
6
Click the Add/Remove Key frame ( ) button located to the right of the property
name. This adds a key frame for the current value of the Opacity property at the 
current position of the playhead.
You can use the Add/Remove Key frame button to add or remove a key frame at the current position of the playhead.
3 
Move the playhead back to the beginning (00;00;00;00) of the Timeline, and in the
Eff ect Controls panel, change the Opacity property’s value to 0.0% to make it fully 
transparent.
Press the spacebar on your keyboard to see the animation you have created play in the 
Program Monitor. Stop the playback when you are satisfi ed with what you have seen
by pressing the spacebar again.
4 
The last animation you create is going to be diff erent. The animation looks odd when 
the text fl ies over the white frame; since that frame is intended to enclose the entire 
logo, it should appear after every other part of the logo is already in place. 
Once again move the playhead to the 2-second (00;00;02;00) mark on the Timeline, 
and then click the clip named Frame to make it active and reveal its properties in the
Eff ect Controls panel.
Click the reveal triangle next to the Opacity property group and change the property’s 
value to 0.0%. This creates a key frame at the current position of the playhead, where 
the clip is completely transparent.
When the Toggle Animation switch is enabled for a property, any change to the property’s value creates a keyframe at the current 
position of the playhead.

frame around the logo fully visible.
Move the playhead back to the beginning of the Timeline and press the spacebar on 
your keyboard to see the animation you have created play in the Program Monitor.
Stop the playback when you are satisfi ed with what you have seen by pressing the 
spacebar again.

In the Project panel, double-click the Animated Logo-Bad Robot sequence to make it 
the active sequence in the Timeline panel.
Drag the Bad Robot Production-NTSC sequence from the Project panel to the
Video 2 track in the Animated Logo-Bad Robot sequence so it is placed above the
abstract background already there.
You can add sequences to tracks in other sequences just as you would with other type of media.

Working with motion graphics from After Eff ects
Adobe After Eff ects has long been a standard in the creation of motion graphics for television 
and video. In recent years, as bandwidth increased and the Internet gained better support for 
rich media, After Eff ects has also been used to create graphic intros and animation for the Web. 
Additionally, After Eff ects is now used to create content seen in presentation graphics and mobile 
devices. After Eff ects is a tool for storytelling, a way to create visually appealing motion graphics 
that can be integrated into any medium.
What is Adobe Dynamic Link?
One of the greatest time-consuming aspects of creating motion graphics and integrating them
into your video project is the necessity of rendering your graphics fi les so you can import them 
into your NLE (Non-linear Editing System). Called intermediate renders, these video or image
fi les require that you return to the original application that created them to edit or modify 
your graphics. To solve the problems of this intermediary system, Adobe created Dynamic Link. 
Running through various applications in the entire creative suite, Dynamic Link is a system 
designed to allow you to import native source fi les directly into application such as Premiere 
Pro, After Eff ects, and Encore. In Premiere Pro, you can use this system to import pre-existing 
After Eff ects compositions or create them from scratch to match the settings of your existing 
sequence. To use Dynamic Link, do one of the following:
Choose File > Adobe Dynamic Link > New After Eff ects Composition. This creates a new After 
Eff ects composition (the equivalent of a sequence), imports it into the Project panel, and then
opens After Eff ects so you can create your graphics content.
or
Choose File > Adobe Dynamic Link > Import After Eff ects Composition to import a non-
rendered, native After Eff ects composition into your Premiere Pro project.

Questions
1 
When creating text and graphics for broadcast video, why are safe zones important?
2 
What are lower thirds and where are they often seen?
3 
When working in the Titler, what are the six Type tools and what does each of them 
do?
Answers
1 
Most television sets perform a function called over scanning on the video frame. As
a result of this over scanning process, the outer edges of the picture may be placed
outside the viewable area of the screen. Since the amount of over scanning is not 
consistent on diff erent devices, the safe zones are a general guideline to help ensure 
that all the important information in a video frame is visible.
2 
Lower thirds are used to add on-screen text to help explain or illuminate some aspect 
of video. Often used in documentary style projects, lower thirds are commonly used 
to introduce an individual or setting.
3 
Type tool & Vertical Type tool: The Type Tool creates horizontal lines of text you 
can read from left to right; the Vertical Type tool creates vertical lines of text you can 
read from top to bottom. To use these tools, you do not need to create a boundary
text frame, just click the drawing area where you want the text to appear, and then 
type the text.
Area Type tool & Vertical Area Type tool: Unlike text created with the Type 
tools, the text created with the Area and Vertical Area Type tools is constrained to a 
boundary text frame. To create the boundary text frame, click and drag these tools 
where you want the text to appear, and then type your text. The text automatically 
wraps to form new lines when it reaches the boundary of the text box.
Path Type tool & Vertical Path Type tool: The Path Type tools allow you to
create a curved path to then create the text that follows it. Using these tools is very 
similar to using the Pen tool in graphics applications such as Photoshop and Illustrator.
To create the curved path, click the drawing area at the point you want your text to 
start. Then click and drag to create the second point and continue clicking until you
have created the path you want. Once you have completed the path, type your text
and it will automatically conform to the contour of the path.

What are video effects?
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
What are video eff ects?
Video eff ects are processes you can apply to video clips on the Timeline. In Premiere Pro, 
eff ects are grouped into categories based on their use. There are two types of eff ects in 
Premiere Pro: fi xed and standard.
Fixed eff ects are the pre-built eff ects automatically added to every clip on the Timeline. The 
fi xed eff ects include: Motion, Opacity, Time Remapping, and Volume. 
Standard eff ects add special qualities to your video, such as adjusted colors, blurriness, 
and noise. Premiere Pro includes several standard eff ects, but there are several third-party 
eff ects you can purchase from vendors such as Boris FX (www.borisfx.com), Digieff ects
(www.digieff ects.com), and Synthetic Apperture (www.synthetic-ap.com). 
Applying video eff ects
Eff ects are applied to clips on the Timeline instead of in between them, as is the case with
transitions. All the video eff ects you can access in Premiere Pro are stored in the Eff ects panel, 
which is the library that contains all eff ects and transitions in the application. Eff ects are easy
to apply: you locate the eff ect you want in the Eff ects panel using the search fi eld or nested 
folder display and drag it to the clip you want in the Timeline. Once applied, you can edit
eff ect properties in the Eff ect Controls panel when you select the clip in the Timeline. 
Creating a Black & White eff ect
The Black & White eff ect de-saturates a color video clip and makes it appear as though it
were shot on black-and-white fi lm. Since modern camcorders only record in color, this
eff ect is useful when you want to simulate an old-fashioned look on modern footage, or just 
create an artistic or dramatic eff ect.
In this part of the lesson, you will work with a pre-built Premiere Pro project and add the 
Black & White eff ect to a clip on the Timeline. The media for this section of the lesson can 
be found at Media Library > Travelogue-New York > video.
1 
From the Premiere Pro Welcome screen, click the Open Project button, or with 
Premiere Pro already open, chose File > Open Project. Navigate to the pr07lessons
folder you copied to your hard drive and locate the pr0701.prproj fi le. Double-click 
the fi le to open it.

Lesson 7, Using Video Effects
This project contains a sequence called Lake Scene. In this sequence, the video from 
the Central Park-NYC-Lake Scene.AVI has been placed on the Timeline and 
divided into two parts. You will apply the Black & White eff ect to the fi rst clip on the 
Timeline.
The Central Park-NYC-Lake Scene.AVI clip on the Timeline was divided into two 
pieces using the Razor tool. After dividing the clip, the fi rst part was dragged to the Video 2 track, 
and the Out Point of this clip was extended using the Selection tool to overlap the beginning of 
the second clip by 30 seconds.
2 
If you are still in the default editing workspace, you will fi nd the Eff ects panel to the 
left of the Timeline. Click the Eff ects panel’s tab to make the panel active and visible.
The Eff ects panel is the library for all the eff ects and transitions available in Premiere Pro.

Type the word black in the search fi eld at the top of the panel. This limits the content 
of the panel so only folder names, eff ects, and transitions that have the letters b l a c k
in their names appear.
The search fi eld is helpful when fi nding specifi c eff ects or transitions.

When the rendering is done, Premiere Pro previews the Timeline automatically.
Notice that the black-and-white eff ect cuts out sharply when the clip ends; you will
adjust this in the next part of the lesson by creating a transition from one clip to
another.

Choose File > Save As. In the Save Project dialog box that appears, confi rm that you
are still in the pr07lessons folder, rename your fi le to pr0701-working.prproj, and 
click the Save button. Do not close this fi le; you will need it in the next part of the
lesson.
Animating the opacity of clips
To create a natural, more aesthetically pleasing transition between the black-and-white clip
and the color clip, you can have the black-and-white clip fade out to reveal the color clip on 
the video track below it. Opacity is one of the fi xed eff ects available for all video clips that 
you can use to accomplish this.
In this section of the lesson, you will animate the Opacity eff ect of the clip that you added
the Black & White eff ect to earlier in this lesson.
1 
With the pr0701-working.prproj project still open, double-click the video clip on 
the Video 2 track to select it and open it in the Source monitor.
2 
Click the Eff ect Controls panel tab next to the Source Monitor to make it active. The
panel shows you all the Fixed and Standard eff ects currently applied to the selected 
clip. Notice that the panel is divided into two diff erent areas. On the left you can see
the eff ects and on the right you see a mini-Timeline view. This mini-Timeline view is 
used to animate eff ects.
The Eff ect controls panel shows the eff ects of any clip selected in the Timeline panel.
Remember you can adjust the width of the two columns in the Eff ects Controls panel by clicking 
and dragging on the dividing line between the two columns.

Click the reveal triangle to the left of the Opacity eff ect to reveal the Opacity eff ect’s
numerical value. This is where you will animate the clip’s opacity.
The mini-Timeline display of the Eff ect Controls panel lets you animate eff ects.
4 
In the Timeline panel, move the playhead to the 1-second (00;00;01;00) mark. Notice
that the playhead in the mini-Timeline display of the Eff ects Controls panel also 
moves: both playheads are synchronized.
The clip on the Video 1 track begins at exactly the 1-second (00;00;01;00) mark on the 
Timeline. You can drag the playhead while holding the Shift key on your keyboard to force the 
playhead to snap to the beginning or end of the clips on your Timeline.
5 
In the Eff ect Controls panel, notice that the Toggle Animation stopwatch to the left of 
the Opacity eff ect is already enabled. You can use this stopwatch to enable or disable 
animation.
Click the Add/Remove Keyframe button to the right of the Opacity eff ect to create a
keyframe for the clip’s Opacity at the current position of the playhead.
This provides a beginning point for the animation you will create. The beginning 
point stores the clip’s Opacity at 100% (fully opaque).
You set a clip’s opacity to any value between 100% (fully opaque) and 0% (fully transparent).
Keyframes are the basis for most computer-generated animation, and they store the property values 
of each eff ect. When you have two keyframes with diff erent values, Premiere Pro automatically 
animates the change in value.

Lesson 7, Using Video Effects
6 
Hold the Shift key on your keyboard, and in the Timeline, drag the playhead to the
end of the clip on Track 2. Holding down the Shift key forces the playhead to snap to
the beginning and end of clips, as well as markers on the Timeline.
Notice that when you move the playhead in the Timeline, it also moves in the mini-Timeline display in the Eff ects Controls panel.
7 
In the Eff ects Controls panel, change the value of the clip’s Opacity to 0 (zero). This 
automatically adds a keyframe at the end of the clip where Opacity is 0. You now have
a starting and ending value for the property that Premiere Pro can animate.
Since the mini-Timeline view only shows the duration of the active clip, keyframes at the very beginning and end of clips can be 
hard to see.
8 
Press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to render all 
areas of the Timeline that need rendering.
When the rendering is done, Premiere Pro previews the Timeline automatically.
Notice that the Black & White clips fades out to reveal the full color one.
The contrast in the Black & White clip is weak; you will adjust this in the next part of 
the lesson.

Adjusting the tonality of clips
Sometimes you want to use the eff ects available to you in Premiere Pro for artistic purposes, 
while at other times you can use them to correct or adjust footage that isn’t perfect. You can 
use the Levels eff ect to enhance the tonality of your image, which is useful when correcting 
footage that has a lighting aberration or low contrast, or to create a dramatic or artistic eff ect. 
For this exercise, notice that after applying the Black & White eff ect to the fi rst park video 
clip, it now appears washed out and dull. The problem occurred because the video has a very 
limited tonal range, so the darkest areas are not very dark and the lightest areas are not very
bright. The variation between the lightest and darkest areas of an image is called the contrast, 
and you can adjust it using video eff ects.
In this section of the lesson, you will add an eff ect to the black-and-white clip to adjust its 
tonal variation and create a greater amount of contrast.
1 
With the pr0701-working.prproj project still open, type the word levels in the
search fi eld of the Eff ects panel to reveal two video eff ects: Auto Levels and Levels. 
You can use these eff ects to adjust the tonal variation of a video clip. The Levels eff ect 
lets you control the amount of tonal adjustment; the Auto Levels eff ect adjusts the 
video clip to meet a set base standard.
The Eff ect panel’s search results become more refi ned when you add more letters to the search term.

Lesson 7, Using Video Effects
2 
Drag the Levels eff ect from the Eff ects panel and drop it on the clip on the Video 2 
track. The red bar that indicates the video clip should be rendered appears. 
When you apply an eff ect to a clip, it automatically becomes active so you can edit its properties in the Eff ect Control panel.
Depending on your computer system confi guration, every time you add an eff ect to a clip or 
change the properties of an existing eff ect, you need to render the Timeline again in order to see 
the results of your eff ect at full quality. The same applies when you edit the values of any eff ects
properties.
3 
Move the playhead to the 15-frame (00;00;00;15) mark on the Timeline panel so you
can see the black-and-white clip in the Program monitor. Note that just applying the
Levels eff ect produces no noticeable results because the default settings are neutral. In
the next step, you will adjust the property values to enhance the video image.

In the Eff ect Controls panel, you may need to click the reveal triangle to the left of 
the Levels eff ect to see all the properties of the eff ect that you can edit and animate.
Depending on your monitor resolution, you might not be able to read the property
names because of a lack of space caused by the mini-Timeline displayed on the right of 
the panel.
Some eff ects, such as Black & White, don’t have any properties to edit, but many, such as Levels, off er a wide range of editable 
attributes.
5 
Click the Show/Hide Timeline View to collapse the Timeline display and expand the
property display to the full size of the Eff ect Controls panel. Now the full property
names are visible.
You can collapse the Timeline view to provide a larger area to edit eff ect properties.

Lesson 7, Using Video Effects
Controlling tonal variation with levels
In Premiere Pro, the Levels eff ect doesn’t have graphs and sliders to control it as image 
editing applications such as Adobe Photoshop do. Instead, the Levels eff ect is controlled 
through numerical fi elds. This eff ect is used to regulate the contrast of a video clip by
adjusting the black-and-white input and output levels and gamma of the clip. Changing the 
black or white input levels increases the amount of dark and light areas in the video, which 
increases the video’s contrast. Changing the black or white output levels of a video clip 
reduces the dark and light areas of an image, reducing its contrast. If you overly reduce the 
output levels of an image, your result is a solid gray color. The gamma of a clip is its overall 
brightness value; adjusting it makes the mid-tone areas of an image darker or lighter.
You can use the Levels eff ect to adjust the composite image or any of the three individual 
color channels in the video clip. This allows you to edit the black-and-white input and
output levels and the gamma of the Red, Green, and Blue color channels individually. Each
of the properties that appear under the Levels eff ect has a Toggle Animation stopwatch. You
can animate almost every eff ect property in much the same way as you animated the Opacity
eff ect earlier in this lesson.
6 
Change the value for the (RGB) Black Input Level to 20, and then change the value
of the (RGB) White Input Level to 240. Adjusting the Input Levels of Black & 
White changes the minimum value for which pixels are considered black and white 
respectively, in the video clip. These new values will eff ectively increase the range of 
pixels that are assigned to Black and White in this clip. With a wider range of pixel 
value assigned to black-and-white, the contrast, which is the variation between the
dark and light areas of the image are enhanced.
Click the fx button to the left of the Level eff ect to disable the eff ect and then view the 
video clip’s appearance in the Program monitor with and without the eff ect. Do this a 
few times so you can compare the change eff ects on the clip’s Levels. This is helpful to 
give you an idea of just how much of a change adding a simple eff ect can have.
Make sure you turn the eff ect back on before you advance to the next step in this lesson.
You can toggle eff ects on and off  to easily compare and contrast the eff ects of your enhancements.

Once applied, the Warp Stabilizer eff ect automatically runs. It acts as a background 
process so you are free to perform other actions while it is working on your footage.
The time it takes to complete the Warp Stabilizer analysis will depend on your computer system.
The Warp Stabilizer Eff ect
There are several basic options that you should be familiar with when using the Warp
Stabilizer:
Result: This property controls the intended results of the Warp Stabilizer eff ect. The only
two options are Smooth Motion, which retains the original camera movement of the footage
but attempts to make it appear smoother and less jerky, and No Motion which attempts to
remove all camera movement from the video clip. 
Smoothness: Controls how much of the original footage’s camera motion is stabilized. 
Lower values preserve more of the camera’s original motion while higher values produce a
smoother result. Note that this property is only available when the Result is set to Smooth 
Motion.
Method: Specifi es the highest type of operation the Warp Stabilizer attempts to perform on
the footage;
Position tracking is based on the X and Y position of the content of your footage and is 
the simple type of stabilization that can be performed.
Position, Scale, and Rotation stabilization is based on all three of these properties and 
can provide a better result when the camera is moving through the scene.
Perspective tracking can better stabilize footage that may have perspective shifts.
Subspace Warp attempts to warp diff erent areas of the video frame individually in order 
to attempt to stabilize the entire frame. If at any time the Stabilizer does cannot locate
enough points to perform the selected stabilization, it will fall back to the preceding 
stabilization type.
Framing property specifi es how the borders, (the moving outside edges of the video 
frame that result from the stabilization eff ect) appear when the stabilizing result is viewed.

Stabilize Only displays the entire frame including the moving edges. This is good when 
you want to see how much work is being done by the Warp Stabilizer.
Stabilize, Crop crops the moving Edges without scaling them up. This results in a
stabilized video frame that is smaller in size than the original video frame that was 
stabilized.
Stabilize, Crop, Auto-scale is the default result of the Warp Stabilizer. This crops the
moving edges and then scales up the resulting stabilized image to fi ll the entire size of the 
original video frame.
Stabilize, Synthesize Edges fi lls in the space created by the moving edges with content
extrapolated from adjacent frames. Users of Adobe Photoshop may fi nd it like a similar, 
tough, unrelated eff ect named Content Aware Fill.
5 
Press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to render all
areas of the Timeline that need rendering. Rendering time will vary based on your 
system confi guration.
Notice that while there is still camera movement in the footage, it is much smoother 
after the eff ect has been applied. When working with the Warp Stabilizer, you might 
fi nd that the default settings will work in some situations without being adjusted. Such 
is the case with this footage; however, you might want to adjust properties such as 
Smoothness to remove a greater or lesser amount of camera shake based on the needs 
of your specifi c project.

Self study
Using your own footage or the footage provided with this book, experiment with the
diff erent eff ects in the application and see how they can be used to enhance or alter your 
footage.
Just a thought about working with green or blue screens: While commercial green screens 
can be a bit expensive, there are ways to mitigate the costs. To make budget video shoots
work fi lmmakers have been known to use regular fabric stretched on a rack or paint a wall 
with green or blue house paint and even colored poster board can be used to create quick, 
portable and cheap green screens. Remember, that with today’s sophisticated software, your 
screens don’t have to be the exact chroma key green or blue colors to be eff ective.

What is the Warp Stabilizer used for?
Answers
1 
The two types of eff ects available in Premiere Pro are Fixed Eff ects and Standard 
Eff ects. Fixed eff ects are the pre-built eff ects automatically added to every clip on the
Timeline. The fi xed eff ects include Motion, Opacity, Time Remapping, and Volume.
Standard eff ects are used to add special qualities to your video, such as adjusted colors, 
blurriness, or noise. The Premiere Pro application includes several standard eff ects you 
can use.

Working with Track Mattes
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
Working with Track Mattes
Track Mattes, or Traveling mattes, is a technique used to hide or reveal specifi c areas of a
video clip. This eff ect is achieved by using another video clip as the source of the track matte. 
You can use the source clip’s alpha or luminance to identify the parts of the target clip that 
are visible. Alpha is the technical name for transparency; luminance is a measure of brightness 
of a video image. 
A video clip or still image of text, or text created using the Titler, is a common source for 
track mattes. This technique, called clipping masks in programs such as Photoshop and 
Illustrator, allows the video or still image text clip to mask the layer below it so you can 
see an image or video inside the text shape. You can animate track matte sources by adding 
keyframes for any of the layer’s fi xed Motion eff ects. 
Preparing the clip for a Track Matte
In this part of the lesson, you will use a 3-second (00;00;03;00) animation of the screen
image transitioning from solid white to solid black. You will use this video clip to create 
a custom transition at the end of the clip on the Video 2 track using the Track Matte Key
eff ect. Since the clip you will use as the source for the eff ect is only three seconds long, 
you can’t use it on a clip longer than the target video. To fi x this problem, you will split the 
Central Park-NYC-Fountain Scene.AVI so the fi nal three seconds, the section that overlaps 
the Central Park-NYC-Lake Scene. AVI, form a separate clip. You will then apply the eff ect
to this new split clip. You must prepare the clip this way so the rest of the clip does not 
become transparent.
The media used in this portion of the lesson can all be found in the Media
Library folder. The video (Central Park-NYC-Fountain Scene.AVI and
Central Park-NYC-Lake Scene.AVI) used is located in the video sub-folder of the
Travelogue-New York media folder. The QuickTime fi le (Animated Track Matte.mov) 
used as the track matte here is located in the Graphics folder.
Please note that users of the Windows operating system must have the free QuickTime player 
installed to import some video types.

Using the Ultra Keyer
Chroma keying lets you composite two images together by removing a specifi c color from
one of the images. You can use chroma keying when you shoot video of your subject in front 
of a blue or green screen and then replace the screen color with a diff erent background. 
Some examples of using this technique, also called color keying, blue screening, or green 
screening, is weather reporting on television and fi lms that use virtual backgrounds and set 
extensions.
Adobe Premiere Pro includes several standard eff ects used for keying video footage; you used 
one of these when you created a track matte. The Ultra Key eff ect combines several diff erent 
keying eff ects into one and provides a single point of control for many keying tasks.
The Ultra Key Eff ect properties
The Ultra Keyer has many important properties that you can adjust to fi ne tune your chroma 
keying results. Some of the important, adjustable properties are explained below. 
Matte Generation
Transparency: Sets the amount of transparency of the source footage. A value of 100 is fully 
transparent; a value of 0 is fully opaque.
Highlight: Sets the opacity of lightest areas of the source video footage. You can adjust this 
property to enhance the transparency of a color screen that lacks a single consistent tone. The 
available values of this property range from 0 to 100, with a default value of 50. A value of 0 
has no eff ect on the source video.
Shadow: Sets the opacity of dark areas of the source video footage. Use this property to adjust the 
transparency of a dark element that has become transparent. The available values of this property
range from 0 to 100, with a default value of 50. A value of 0 has no eff ect on the source video.

Lesson 8, Using Video Effects
The Ultra Key Eff ect properties (continued)
Tolerance: Filters out colors that have seeped into the foreground area from the background, 
such as those caused by color spill. Increase the tolerance to allow for a greater amount of 
variation from the chosen key color. The available values of this property range from 0 to 
100, with a default value of 50. A value of 0 has no eff ect on the source video.
Pedestal: Filters out noise in a grainy image. Noise is often caused in video footage because 
of low light conditions. The available values of this property range from 0 to 100, with a 
default value of 10. A value of 0 has no eff ect on the source video.
Choke: Shrinks the size of the alpha channel matte created by the color key eff ect by 
tightening or contracting the matte following the contours of your foreground subject. The 
available values of this property range from 0 to 100, with a default value of 0.
Soften: Softens or blurs the edge of the alpha channel matte created by the color key process 
using a box blur fi lter (fractional kernel size). The available values of this property range from
0 to 100, with a default value of 0.
Contrast: Adjusts the contrast: the variation between the lightest and darkest areas along the 
edge of the matte. The available values of this property range from 0 to 100, with a default 
value of 0.
Mid Point: Sets the mid-point for the contrast property. The available values of this property
range from 0 to 100, with a default value of 50.
Spill Suppression
Desaturate: Sets the saturation of the background color. Use this property to desaturate 
colors close to being fully transparent; for example, the color fringe at the edge of a 
foreground subject caused by a background color cast. The available values of this property 
range from 0 to 100, with a default value of 25.
Range: Sets the amount of color spill that is desaturated. The available values of this property
range from 0 to 100, with a default value of 50.
Spill: Adjusts the amount of spill compensation. The available values of this property range 
from 0 to 100, with a default value of 50.
Luma: Restores the original luminance values of the source footage using the alpha channel 
created by the keying eff ect. The available values of this property range from 0 to 100, with a 
default value of 50.
Color Correction
Saturation: Sets the saturation: the intensity of the color values of the foreground subjects 
in the source video footage. The available values of this property range from 0 to 100, with a 
default value of 100.
Hue: Sets the hue: the color values of the foreground subjects in the source video. The 
available values of this property range from –180° to +180 ° with a default value of 0°.
Luminance: Sets the luminance or brightness of the foreground subjects in the source video. 
The available values of this property range from 0 to 200, where 0 is black and 100 is 4x the 
base luminance value. The default value of this property is 100.

Creating a garbage matte
The fi rst step in the chroma keying process is to create a garbage matte to isolate the subject
and the area immediately around it. A garbage matte is created quickly and doesn’t need to 
be precise. It is usually just a rough shape that removes any extraneous areas of the video
frame that do not need to be removed using a keying eff ect. When using a green screen, the
important area is the one around your subject, especially if they are moving. You will often 
see parts of the set, such as a light stand, or the frame holding the screen at the edges of the
video image; use the garbage matte to remove these areas.
There are three types of garbage mattes you can create in Premiere Pro, which are 
diff erentiated by the number of anchor points each has. You can use the 4, 8, and 16 point
Garbage Mattes to quickly mask the unimportant areas of a video image before applying 
the Ultra Key eff ect.
The media used in this portion of the lesson can be found in the Media Library folder. All 
the footage can be found in the Jeff  Jacobs Music Video folder.
1 
From the Premiere Pro Welcome screen, click the Open Project button, or with 
Premiere Pro already open, chose File > Open Project. Navigate to the pr08lessons 
folder you copied to your hard drive and locate the pr0802.prproj fi le. Double-click 
the fi le to open it.
This fi le contains a single sequence called Using the Ultra Keyer. There are two
movie clips within this sequence: Central Park-Laura Walking.mpeg on the Video 1
track, and Jeff  Jacobs-Greenscreen CloseUp.mpeg is above it on the Video 2 track.
2 
Click the Eff ects panel’s tab to make the panel active and to bring it to the front of 
the panel group. Then, in the search fi eld, type the word garbage to reveal all the
Garbage Matte eff ects in Premiere Pro.
Drag the Four Point Garbage Matte eff ect to the
Jeff  Jacobs-Greenscreen CloseUp.mpeg clip on the Video 2 track.
Garbage mattes come with 4, 8, or 16 anchor points that you can use depending on the complexity of the shape you are trying 
to matte.

Lesson 8, Using Video Effects
3 
With the Jeff  Jacobs-Greenscreen CloseUp.mpeg clip selected, click the Eff ect
Controls panel to reveal it and make it active. The properties of the eff ect applied to
the Jeff  Jacobs-Greenscreen CloseUp.mpeg clip are visible in the panel.
Click the Show/Hide Timeline view button to hide the mini-Timeline.
Adding an eff ect to a clip automatically selects that clip so its properties are immediately accessible in the Eff ect Controls panel.
4 
In the Eff ect Controls panel, click the eff ect called Four-Point Garbage Matte to 
reveal the matte’s control points in the Program Monitor.
If necessary, click on the reveal triangle to the left of the Four-Point Garbage Matte 
eff ect to view its properties. The matte has a property to set each of the individual 
corner’s control points. Each property has two values: the X (Horizontal) position 
and the Y (Vertical) position. In the Eff ect Controls panel display, the fi rst value for 
each control points property is its X position while the second value is the point’s Y 
position. The idea behind using a garbage matte is to limit the area that the keyer will 
have to calculate without accidentally removing any part of your subject. A garbage 
matte is also used to remove any background content that may exist outside of the area 
you want to key out.
By default, the Four-Point Garbage Matte’s control points are positioned at the corners
of your clip. Make the following changes to the Properties: 
Top-Left: Change the value of the X position (the fi rst value) to 655 and leave the 
second value as is.
Top-Right: Leave this property as is.
Bottom-Right: Leave this property as is.
Bottom-Left: Change the value of the X position (the fi rst value) to 105 and leave
the second value as is.
A small portion of the background clip is now visible because you moved the garbage 
matte’s corner points. Since the subject (the guy singing, Jeff  Jacobs) is moving 
constantly; we have to be very loose with the matte.

Using the Ultra Keyer
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
Scrub (drag backward and forward on the timeline) the playhead to make sure the 
matte is not too close to him and avoid removing a part of his body.
The garbage matte need not be perfect since its purpose is to remove extraneous areas.
5 
Choose File > Save As. In the Save Project dialog box that appears, confi rm that you 
are still in the Lesson 8 folder, rename your fi le to pr0802-working.prproj, and click 
the Save button. Do not close this fi le; you will need it in the next part of the lesson.
Now that the garbage matte is in place, you will apply the Ultra Key eff ect to the clip 
in the next step.
Applying the Ultra Key
The Ultra Key eff ect contains a series of eff ects to generate color keys quickly and effi  ciently. 
All the tools that you need to generate the alpha (transparency) matte by removing the
background green color, adjust the edges of the matte to eliminate color spill from the 
background and even color correct the foreground footage itself are all located in a single
location. 
1 
With the pr0802-working.prproj project still open, type the word ultra in the
search fi eld at the top of the Eff ects panel to reveal the Ultra Key.
You do not need to capitalize words when using the panel search fi eld.

Drag the Ultra Key eff ect to the Jeff  Jacobs-Greenscreen CloseUp.mpeg clip on the 
Video 2 track.
All eff ects are applied by dragging and dropping them onto clips on the Timeline.
3 
If necessary, click the Eff ect Controls panel to reveal it and make it active. The
properties of the eff ect you applied to the Jeff  Jacobs-Greenscreen CloseUp.mpeg clip 
are visible in the panel.
Again, if necessary click the Show/Hide Timeline view button to hide the
mini-Timeline, and then click the reveal triangle to the left of the Ultra Key eff ect to
see its properties.
4 
Click the Key Color eyedropper to activate it, and then click the slightly darker green
area to the left of the subject’s shoulder. The green background is removed, making 
the background video visible.
The Ultra Key eff ect removes areas of an image that match the selected Key Color.
5 
The area where the Ultra Key eff ect removes the green screen appears diff erent from
the area revealed by the garbage matte, because the screen wasn’t a single continuous 
tone; it had some darker and lighter areas. Some of these areas are still slightly opaque, 
causing the overlay eff ect, you. You can see this if you look closely at the Program 
Monitor.
Click the reveal triangle to the left of the Matte Generation group to view the
properties contained there. If necessary you can hide any other revealed properties
such as those of the Four-Point Garbage Matte to give yourself more room in the
Eff ect Controls panel.

Change the value of the Pedestal property to 49 to remove the remaining white 
overlay.
The other properties in this group should be set as follows;
Transparency: 40 
Highlight: 10
Shadow: 50
Tolerance: 50
The Ultra Key is sometimes a one-click solution; however in this case, you have to adjust it to produce optimal results
6 
Click the reveal triangle to the left of the Matte Cleanup property group. Change the
value of the Choke property to 9 and the value for Soften to 17.
This completes the adjustments to the eff ect.
You can animate almost every property in the Ultra Key eff ect. While not often used for simple 
greenscreen removal, animating the eff ect’s properties allows to you create special eff ects such as
custom wipes and dissolves.
7 
Press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to render all 
areas of the Timeline that need rendering. The process could be long because of the
complexity of the Ultra Key eff ect.
When the rendering is done, the application previews the Timeline automatically.
The green screen has been completely removed by the eff ect.

Spill Suppression and Color Correction

Lesson 8, Using Video Effects
Spill Suppression and Color Correction
The power of the Ultra Keyer doesn’t stop at simply removing the green screen from your 
video footage. One of this eff ect’s greatest strengths is that it can also be used to adjust the 
color of your subject; a process that used to require you to add several additional eff ects. 
When you shoot video of a subject in front of a green or blue screen, it is very common for 
some of the screen’s color to spill onto your subject. This is especially the case if the subject
is too close to the screen itself. Another problem that you may encounter is caused by the
diff erent types and strengths of lighting in the subject and background video. Luckily, the 
Ultra Keyer provides tools that allow you to correct both of these issues.
1 
With the pr0802-working.prproj project still open and the 
Jeff  Jacobs-Greenscreen CloseUp.mpeg selected in the Timeline panel, locate the 
Ultra Key eff ect in the Eff ect Controls panel. Click on the reveal triangle to the 
left of the Spill Suppression property group to see the Desaturate, Range, Spill, and 
Luma properties. You may need to hide other property groups to avoid having to 
scroll up/down in the panel.
2 
Set the Desaturate value to 80. You should be able to see the color of the video in the 
Program monitor change: The green tint that his skin and edge of clothing had is now gone. 
The Spill Suppression property group removes the tint of the set Key Color.
3 
Notice that the foreground fi gure appears much darker than the background. This is
due to the diff erent lighting set-up used in each scene. Click the reveal triangle next 
to the Color Correction property group in the Eff ect Controls panel to view the 
Saturation, Hue, and Luminance properties.
4 
Change the Luminance property to 125. This makes the foreground video brighter 
and closer to the brightness of the background footage. 
5 
Choose File > Save or press Ctrl+S (Windows) or Command+S (Mac OS) to save
these changes to your project.
You can now close this project; you have completed this part of the lesson.

What is chroma keying and what is it used for?
Answers
1 
Track Mattes, also called Traveling mattes, is a technique used to hide or reveal 
specifi c areas of a video clip. You can make a track matte based on the source clip’s 
alpha (transparency) or luma (brightness) channels.
2 
A Garbage Matte removes any extraneous areas of the video frame that do not need to 
be removed using a keying eff ect.
3 
Chroma keying is a technique used in fi lm and television that lets you composite 
two images together by removing a specifi c color from one of them. Chroma keying 
is used most often when you shoot video of your subject in front of a blue or green 
screen and then replace the screen color with a diff erent background image or video.

Understanding digital audio
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom

Understanding digital audio
Digital audio is composed of analog sound waves that are captured and converted into a
digital fi le, and its quality is determined by sample rate and bit depth.
The process that converts analog sound into a digital fi le doesn’t actually capture the entirety 
of the analog source verbatim. Instead it samples the original signal in order to create a digital
representation of it. The sample rate is the number of samples that are made in a given time span; 
usually a second. The higher the sampling rate of a digital fi le, the greater the quality and clarity. 
A commercially available audio CD has a sample rate of 44 kHz or 44,100 samples per second.
The bit depth of a fi le measures the amount of data each sample contains. The greater the 
bit depth of a digital audio fi le, the greater its possible dynamic range will be. For example, 
recordings with a limited dynamic range sound hollow and of low quality, while those with 
a higher range can better reproduce the natural sound of a range of musical instruments and
other audio sources. A commercially available audio CD has a bit depth of 16 bits.
A standard digital camera usually records audio at 48 kHz, or 48,000 samples per second at
16 bits.
Understanding audio tracks
In Premiere Pro you can add audio to your sequences, edit it and also add eff ects to it. In this 
application, there are three types of audio fi les you can come into contact with; mono, stereo
and 5.1 surround.
Stereo audio
Most on-camera and studio microphones record stereo sound.
A Stereo sound fi le contains a left and right audio track. In true stereo applications, these two
tracks contain diff erent audio signals to create the illusion of directionality; in many cases, the 
same sounds are duplicated on both channels. Most stock audio, along with audio captured from
a camcorder’s onboard microphone, as well as audio ripped from compact disks, will be stereo.

Lesson 9, Working with Audio

Mono audio
Many external mics that can be attached to cameras, record mono audio.
A Mono audio signal contains a single audio track. Many external microphones that you can
attach to video camcorders record mono sound.
5.1 audio
5.1 audio is one of the surround sound types used to enhance the movie going experience.
5.1 Surround Sound uses multiple speakers to surround listeners in a 360º bubble of sound 
to better simulate the way we perceive sound in a live environment. The 5.1 system uses fi ve 
speakers and one sub-woofer to achieve this eff ect and it is the only type of Surround Sound 
currently supported on the Premiere Pro Timeline.

In Premiere Pro sequences, you can add as many tracks as your computer system’s
confi guration will allow. 
Premiere Pro can automatically detect and interact with the audio devices connected to your 
computer, but occasionally you might need to manually adjust the application’s preferences to 
use a specifi c audio device. Set up the default audio device to use for input or output by choosing 
Edit > Preferences > Audio Hardware (Windows) or Premiere Pro > Preferences > Audio 
Hardware (Mac OS).
As there are diff erent types of audio you can work with in a project, there are also diff erent
types of audio tracks you can create in your Premiere Pro sequence. The Standard audio track 
type can accommodate both Mono and Stereo audio clips, and it is the default track type in
the application. The Mono track type only contains a single audio channel rather than the
two available with Stereo tracks. If you add a stereo clip to a mono track it is automatically
converted into a mono clip. The Adaptive track type can contain both mono and stereo
tracks much like the Standard type can, but with adaptive tracks, you can map source audio
to diff erent output audio channels. And fi nally, 5.1 tracks can contain only 5.1 audio clips. 
When creating audio tracks in a sequence you can either create a new regular audio track
or a sub-mix track. Regular audio tracks are the standard, mono, adaptive and 5.1 options
mentioned previously, while sub-mix tracks can be set as the output destination for multiple
regular tracks. Sub-mix tracks are useful for managing audio mixes and eff ects. In this lesson, 
you will be working primarily with stereo audio fi les and the standard track type.
Stripping audio from a video fi le
Occasionally, you might choose to use your camera to record environmental or ambient
sound, a particular sound eff ect, or voiceover because you don’t have access to dedicated 
recording equipment. In such cases, you will need to separate the audio track from the video 
fi le you are working with. After you strip the audio from its associated video fi le, the audio 
track becomes a separate fi le that you can add to the Timeline independently or use it in 
other applications, such as Adobe Audition.
In this part of the lesson, you will extract the audio track from a video fi le so you can add it 
to an existing sequence. The fi le you will work with is a scenic shot from New York’s Central 
Park. You will add it to a still image montage to incorporate environmental ambient sound 
and help establish a location and emotional feel. You can fi nd the media for this project in the 
Travelogue-New York folder located in the Media Library folder, in their respective images
and video sub-folders.

With the video clip highlighted, choose Clip > Audio Options > Extract Audio to
strip the audio track from the fi le. You do not need to specify any settings with this 
command. Premiere Pro creates a separate and independent audio fi le by ripping the 
audio from the original video clip, just as you would rip audio from a music CD. The 
new fi le is created in the same directory that contains your Premiere Pro project fi le,
and then immediately imported into your project.
The new audio fi le is saved in the same bin as the video fi le from which it was extracted.
Recall that the original video clip stored in your hard drive remains intact. Premiere Pro creates
the new audio fi le by copying the audio data from the original video fi le.

Audio channel mapping
Premiere Pro sequences require that you specify the type of track you want to create for 
audio. Some track types, such as Mono, only accept that type of audio clip while others, such 
as standard, allow you to mix diff erent clip types together. Since video fi les could contain a 
single stereo or mono track, or dual mono tracks, it may sometimes be necessary to adjust
how the application is treating an audio clip. Audio channel mapping is the feature in 
Premiere Pro that helps you perform the desired conversion.
In this part of the lesson, you will change the mapping of a mono audio clip to interpret it as
a stereo clip and place it onto a stereo track on the Timeline.

Making a Three-Point edit on the Timeline
In this exercise, you only need to add a section of the music clip to the Timeline, rather than
the entire clip. For such a case, you can eff ectively use the Three-Point edit. This type of edit
adds a portion of the clip in the Source Monitor to the Timeline by setting two markers 
on the Timeline that defi ne the duration of the clip you want to add, and a single marker 
in the Source Monitor that defi nes the starting point of the source. When you add this clip 
to the Timeline, the two In Points become aligned, and you can then add footage to fi ll the
destination area defi ned on the Timeline.
In this section of the lesson, you will add the Classical Background Music.mp3 clip to
the Timeline using a Three-Point edit.

Setting volume keyframes
When adding incidental audio to your Premiere Pro sequences, you may obscure other audio
that is also on the timeline. Unlike when working with the video in your sequence, where 
only the top video layer is visible at any time, all audio fi les play simultaneously. This can
make the sound in your video diffi  cult to understand because the background music would 
play over the dialogue, or the sound eff ect would overpower the voiceover. This relationship
between audio clips makes it extremely important that you are aware of the relative volume
of each clip you are using. Premiere Pro can help you solve this issue by animating the
volume of any audio clip on the Timeline.
In this section of the lesson, you will add keyframes to the volume property of an audio clip 
to animate a change in volume over time.
1 
With the pr0902-working.prproj project still open, click the Timeline panel to 
activate it and if necessary move the playhead to the beginning (00;00;00;00) of the 
sequence.
In the previous lesson, you lowered the volume of the 
Classical Background Music.mp3 clip to hear the narration over it; now you will 
animate the end of the clip so the music fades.
2 
In the Timeline panel, place your cursor at the bottom of the A2 track header. When
your cursor becomes a double-headed arrow ( ), click and drag down to enlarge the
track height.
You must fi rst expand a track to see the audio waveform of clips on that track.
3 
Click the Playhead Position fi eld located at the upper-left of the Timeline panel, type 
1706 and press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on the keyboard to
move the playhead to the 17-second and 6-frame mark (00;00;17;06) on the Timeline.

If it isn’t currently selected, double-click the Classical Background Music.mp3
clip on the Timeline to make it active, and then if necessary, click the Eff ect Controls 
panel to reveal it once again. Notice that the right part of the panel contains a mini-
Timeline view to help you animate clip eff ects.
The playhead in the Eff ect Controls panels Timeline view is a mirror of the one on the Timeline.
You can adjust the size of the Properties and mini-Timeline view in the Eff ect Control 
panel by dragging the dividing line between them.
5 
Click the Toggle Animation stopwatch to the left of the Level property to enable 
animation. A keyframe is created at the current position of the playhead.
New keyframes are always created at the current position of the playhead when creating animation.
6 
In the Timeline panel, press and hold the Shift key on the keyboard and drag the 
playhead to the end of the last clip, this will be at the 19-second and 21-frame 
(00:00:19:21) mark. You can also press the End key on your keyboard while the 
Timeline panel is active.
7 
In the Eff ect Controls panel, change the value of the Level property to –100. This
creates a new keyframe at the current position of the playhead on the Timeline, and 
the audio volume fades out toward the end of the clip.
Premiere Pro automatically animates changes when it detects a diff erence in the values of your keyframes.

Improving audio in Premiere Pro
You might often record audio that has extraneous sounds. For example, you might record
voiceovers with background noise from your surroundings; or you might record a scene in 
a crowded room and pick up some of the surrounding conversations. Your audio could also 
be too low in volume due to your microphone settings or the speaker being far from the
microphone.
In this part of the lesson, you will adjust the voiceover clips to raise the volume and remove
the increased background noise created by doing so.
1 
With the pr0902-working.prproj project still open, double-click the fi rst 
voiceover clip on the A1 track on the Timeline to make it active. If you hover 
your cursor over this clip, you will see a pop-up tip that confi rms that it is named 
Shawmut Tours-Introduction.wav.
If necessary, click the Eff ect Controls panel tab located next to the Source Monitor to
reveal it and make it active.
2 
In the Eff ect Controls panel, locate the Level property in the Volume property group 
and click the Toggle Animation stopwatch to disable animation for this property. 
Click the value for Level and change it to 6. This is the highest value to which you
can raise the volume, without adding additional eff ects.
Always remember that 0dB is the baseline audio volume.
3 
Press the spacebar on your keyboard to play the Timeline. Notice that the voiceover is
now louder than before. Let the preview play into the second voiceover clip to really
notice the diff erence in volume. Notice also that the background noise of the clip has 
also been increased by the volume change; we will adjust this in a later step.

236

You can add a Volume eff ect to the clip to increase it further if the initial volume 
change is not enough. Click the Eff ects panel to activate it and make it visible; locate 
the Volume eff ect by clicking Audio Eff ects > Volume. Once located, click the eff ect,
then drag and drop it onto the Shawmut Tours-Introduction.wav clip on the Timeline.
You can add audio eff ects in much the same way as you add video eff ects.
You can also locate eff ects by typing either a full or partial name into the Eff ect panel’s search fi eld.
5 
A new eff ect called Volume appears in the Eff ect Controls panel. If necessary, click the 
reveal triangle to the left of the new eff ect to reveal its properties. Change the value of 
the Level property to 6.
Remember that increasing the volume of a clip also increases the background noise of the clip.
6 
Press the spacebar on your keyboard to play the Timeline. Again the voiceover’s
volume has been increased. Let the preview play into the second voiceover clip to
really notice the diff erence in volume. Notice also that the background noise of the 
clip has also been increased by the volume change and is even more distracting than it 
was originally.
7 
You can fi x the increased noise by applying another fi lter: DeNoiser.
In the Eff ects panel, locate the DeNoiser eff ect in the Audio Eff ects folder by 
typing the word DeNoiser into the panel’s search fi eld. Drag this eff ect onto the
Shawmut Tours-Introduction.wav clip on the Timeline.

The DeNoiser properties
The DeNoiser eff ect automatically detects background noise on a clip and removes it. The 
eff ect was designed to remove noise caused by digitizing analog recordings, but you can use it 
to reduce background noise and drone caused by an improperly sound-dampened recording 
environment. You can apply the eff ect to 5.1, stereo, and mono clips.
Reduction: Since the DeNoiser removes sound that is at a certain volume, use this property 
to set the amount of noise to remove within a range of –20 and 0 dB.
Off set: Sets an off set value between the automatically detected noise level and a value
defi ned by the user. This is limited to a range between –10 and +10 dB. The Off set property 
allows greater control when the automatic noise detection is not enough.
Freeze: Stops the noise fl oor interpretation at the currently established value.
8 
If necessary, click the reveal triangle to the left of the DeNoiser, and then click the
reveal triangle next to Individual Parameters to reveal the Reduction property.
The Reduction parameter is used to set the volume of the sounds that are reduced in the clip.

Click the reveal triangle to the left of the Reduction property, and move the slider to
the left until the property value reads –10dB.
Your own clips will require you to adjust diff erent properties.
10 If necessary, move the playhead to the beginning of the timeline (00:00:00:00) and 
press the spacebar on your keyboard to play the Timeline. Notice that the voiceover’s
noise has been signifi cantly reduced. Depending on the specifi cs of your own clip, you 
may have to adjust diff erent values. 
Eff ects can be copied and pasted onto other clips by selecting them on your source
clip; you can use the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key to select 
multiple eff ects and choosing Edit > Copy. Then select the destination clip or clips 
and choosing Edit > Paste.

The four types of audio tracks that can be created in a Premiere Pro sequence are: 
Mono, Standard, Adaptive, and 5.1.
2 
A Three-Point Edit works by adding a portion of the clip currently loaded into the
Source Monitor to the Timeline. The editor then sets two markers on the Timeline 
to defi ne the duration of the clip to add, and a single marker in the Source Monitor to 
defi ne the starting point of the source.

Reduction: Since the DeNoiser removes sound that is at a certain volume, use this 
property to set the amount of noise to remove within a range of –20 and 0 dB.
Off set: Sets an off set value between the automatically detected noise level and a value 
defi ned by the user. This is limited to a range between –10 and +10 dB. The Off set 
property allows greater control when the automatic noise detection is not enough.

Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Creating subclips
An individual video fi le might contain several takes, shots, or scenes. To manage them 
more eff ectively, we recommend separating longer clips into smaller sections called 
subclips. Creating subclips does not aff ect the master clips stored on your hard drive 
because you are not creating additional physical clips. However, Premiere Pro treats 
subclips much like the master clips, so you can add them to the Timeline and gain greater 
freedom for assembling your edits.
You can easily make subclips using the Source Monitor: just set In and Out points on a
master clip and then use the Make Subclip command. 
You can fi nd all the footage for this portion of the lesson in the Media Library within the
Werewolves in Central Park folder.
1 
From the Premiere Pro Welcome screen, click the Open Project button, or with 
Premiere Pro already open, chose File > Open Project. Navigate to the pr10lessons 
folder you copied to your hard drive and locate the pr1001.prproj fi le. Double-click
the fi le to open it.
This project contains a sequence called Central Park Report and links to videos you
can use for A Roll and B Roll.
2 
Locate the Reporter at Crime Scene clip in the Project panel. It will be in the A-roll 
bin, which is inside the Video bin. If necessary, enlarge the width of the panel’s Name 
column to view more of the clip name.
Double-click the clip to open it in the Source Monitor.
This clip is about 20 seconds long and contains two distinct areas you can use: the
crime scene report and the reporter’s sign off . By dividing these two areas into 
individual subclips, you can experiment with the placement of the resulting clips to
craft your scene.

Making a Three-Point edit
A three-point edit is an editing technique used to insert a clip from the Source Monitor 
onto a destination track in the Timeline panel. You accomplish this task by setting a total 
of three edit points shared between the source and destination.
The three-point edit is a very fl exible tool that all editors can utilize. While three point 
edits can make use of both the Source Monitor and Timeline panel, where you start is 
entirely up to you. If you have a set duration on the Timeline to fi ll, you will want to
place the In and Out Points on your Timeline and then add an In Point to the clip in your 
Source Monitor. However, if you have a specifi c area of your Timeline you need to cover,
you can set the In and Out Points in your Source Monitor to defi ne a duration of the clip 
to insert and then add single point on the Timeline to set the destination for this clip. A 
good example of this type of Three-Point Edit is when you need to hide a jump cut by 
covering it with B Roll. 
In this section of the lesson, you will create an In Point on the Timeline to set the 
destination point for the footage that you will insert. You will then create both an In and
Out Point on the clip in the Source Monitor to set it’s duration.

Setting an In Point on the Timeline
To complete this exercise, you will fi rst set an In Point marker on the Timeline.
1 
With the pr1001-working.prproj project still open, move the playhead to the

Point button in the transport controls area of the Program Monitor panel. Notice the 
time ruler at the top of the Timeline now shows a darker color to indicate you marked 
an In Point.
This point will become the destination for the clip you will add to the Timeline as
part of the Three-point edit.
Three-point edits require a total of three In and Out Points split between the Timeline and Source Monitor.
You can remove an In or Out Point marker on the Timeline by right-clicking (Windows) or
Ctrl+click (Mac OS) any area of the time ruler and choosing Clear Sequence Marker > In and 
Out, In or Out, depending on the type of marker you want to remove.

so that only the video from the source clip will be added to the timeline. 
Confi rm that the V1 target track indicator is active and the V1 track is selected.
Keep in mind that both of these actions must be performed for this Three-Point edit 
to work properly.
Perform an Overwrite Edit by clicking the Overwrite button in the transport controls 
area of the Source Monitor, or by pressing the period (.) key on your keyboard.

The Ripple Edit tool is used to trim a clip while shifting the subsequent clips in the 
Timeline by the amount of the trim. A Ripple edit is useful when you want to trim a clip 
without leaving a gap, as happens when trimming clips with the Selection tool. When 
making a Ripple edit between two adjacent clips, the Program Monitor displays a diff erent
preview on the left and right of the monitor: the preview on the left shows the Out Point
of the fi rst video; the one on the right displays the In Point of the second video. The 
previews update dynamically as you adjust the edit line between the clips.

Lesson 10, Advanced Editing Techniques

The Rolling Edit tool is used to simultaneously trim an adjacent Out and In point by
shifting the edit point between the two clips while preserving the overall duration of these
adjacent clips. A Rolling edit is helpful when you need to adjust the edit point between a 
pair of clips to refi ne an edit. Just as with a Ripple edit, the Program Monitor displays a 
side-by-side preview of In and Out points as you change them.
In this part of the lesson, you will use Ripple and Rolling edits to refi ne the current
sequence. In this and subsequent exercises within this lesson, you will use the playhead 
for convenience and consistency when setting a destination point for your trim. However, 
when you perform your own edits, you will likely use the Program Monitor previews to
fi nd match points, and then make your edit points based on those.
1 
With the pr1001-working.prproj project still open, move the playhead to the
1-second and 1-frame mark (00;00;01;01) on the Timeline panel.
2 
Click the Ripple Edit Tool (
) on the Tools panel to activate it, and then move your 
mouse cursor to the end of the fi rst clip on the Timeline (the clip initially called
Crime Scene Tape.mpeg). You may need to zoom in on the Timeline for your 
convenience.
You can activate the Ripple Edit tool by pressing the letter B on your keyboard.
3 
When the cursor is properly positioned at the beginning or end of a clip on the
Timeline, it automatically becomes the yellow Ripple Edit tool ( ). Use this tool to
click the end of the fi rst clip and drag it to the playhead.
The Ripple Edit tool automatically snaps to the playhead when it is close enough.

As you perform a Ripple Edit, the Program Monitor displays two previews: the fi rst is 
the changing End Point of the clip you are trimming; the second is the In Point of the 
clip that follows it. When you release your mouse cursor, all the clips to the right of 
the trim automatically shift positions to avoid creating a gap.
The Program Monitor preview helps you fi nd a match point between the two clips.
4 
In the Timeline panel, move the playhead to the 5-second mark (00;00;05;00) and
then click the Rolling Edit tool in the Tools panel to activate it.
You can activate the Rolling Edit tool by pressing the letter N on your keyboard.
5 
Move the mouse cursor to the edit line between the second and third clips, until the
cursor becomes the Rolling Edit Icon (

Click and drag the Rolling Edit tool to the playhead.
Just as the other editing tools, the Rolling Edit tool automatically snaps to the playhead when it is close to it. Ensure the Snap 
button is enabled on the Timeline.
The Program Monitor displays two video previews as you adjust the edit point with 
the Rolling Edit tool. The preview on the left shows the changing Out Point of the
clip on the left side of the edit line; the preview to the right shows the changing In 
Point of the clip on the right side of the edit.
The Program Monitor preview helps you fi nd a match point between the two clips, just as it does when you make a Ripple edit.
The combined duration of the two clips remains unaff ected because the Rolling Edit
changes the location of the edit point where the two clips join. For this exercise, the 
result is that the long shoot of the crime scene from the bridge is reduced.

of the clip by the same amount without changing the overall duration of that clip. When
using the Slip tool, the Program Monitor displays previews of the In and Out Points of the 
clip you are adjusting and of the fi xed Out and In points of the preceding and following 
clips on the Timeline.

You can use the Slide tool to shift a clip along the Timeline while trimming adjacent clips 
to compensate for the move. Since you use the Slide tool on the clip’s In and Out Points, 
the clip’s duration does not change, but the Out Point of the clip to the left and the In
Point of the clip to the right are trimmed by the amount of frames by which you slide the 
clip. When using the Slide tool, the Program Monitor shows a preview of the clip you are 
sliding, a preview of the changing Out Point of the preceding clip, and a preview of the In 
Point of the following clip.
1 
With the pr1001-working.prproj project still open, move the playhead back to the 
beginning (00;00;00;00) of the Timeline since you do not need it in any particular 
position to make a Slide edit.

In the Tools panel, click the Slip tool (
) to activate it, and then
position it on top of the third video clip in the Timeline, the one called
Crime Scene From Bridge.mpeg.
You can activate the Slip tool by pressing the letter Y on your keyboard.
3 
In this clip, there is a fi gure lurking on the bridge watching the crime scene report 
unfold. It might create a sense of drama to show him in the shot. To do this, you will
perform a Slip edit.
Place the Slip tool over the Crime Scene from Bridge.mpeg clip and then click
and drag it to the right to begin the edit.
Watch the Program Monitor as you are performing the edit. The two small previews 
at the top are the Out and In points of the preceding and following clips. The two
large previews are the new In and Out points you are moving through as you Slip the
clip. At the bottom-left of the Monitor there is a time code display; continue to adjust 
the clip until the display reads +00;00;03;10.
The Program Monitor Overlays will read 00:00:43:10 for the clip’s new In Point and 
00:00:45:00 for the clip’s new Out Point.
The Program Monitor display lets you choose new match points for the beginning and end of the clip.
4 
Move the playhead to the 3-second and 15-frame mark (00;00;03;15) on the Timeline, 
and then click the Slide tool ( ) in the Tools panel to activate it.
You can activate the Slide tool by pressing the letter U on your keyboard.

You might have a better, more dynamic scene if the cut to the fi gure lurking on the 
bridge occurred sooner. To accomplish this, you will perform a Slide edit.
Using the Slide tool ( ), click the Crime Scene From Bridge.mpeg clip and drag 
it toward the playhead.
Similar to the other editing tools, the Slide tool snaps to the playhead automatically when the Snap button is enabled on the 
Timeline. 
Notice that the Out Point of the preceding clip and the In Point of the following clip 
adjusted automatically as you slid the Crime Scene From Bridge.mpeg clip. Also 
notice that the Program Monitor previews the In and Out Points of the clip you are 
sliding and the new Out and In Points for the preceding and following clips.
We strongly recommend using the Program Monitor previews when using the Slide tool.

lesson.
Adjusting the clip speed
Video clips usually play back at the same frame rate at which they were shot. However, 
you can choose to speed up or slow down a clip to create diff erent eff ects. For example,
you could speed up a group of adjacent clips to show the passage of time or show
movement from one place to another; or you could slow down adjacent clips to create a 
slow-motion eff ect.
You can fi nd all the footage used in this section of the lesson in the Travelogue-New York
folder in the Media Library.
1 
From the Premiere Pro Welcome screen, click the Open Project button, or with 
Premiere Pro already open, chose File > Open Project. Navigate to the pr10lessons 
folder you copied to your hard drive, and then locate the pr1002.prproj fi le. Double-
click the fi le to open it. This project contains a sequence called Adjusting Clip Speed 
that contains two clips for which you will adjust the speed.
Choose File > Save As. In the Save Project dialog box that appears, confi rm that you
are still in the pr10lessons folder, rename your fi le to pr1002-working, and click Save
2 
If necessary, move the playhead to the beginning of the Timeline and then press the 
spacebar to preview the Sequence. Notice the speed at which the fi rst video clip plays. 
You can stop the playback at anytime by pressing the spacebar again.

In the Timeline, move the playhead to the 30-second mark (00;00;30;00) and click the 
Rate Stretch tool ( ) in the Tools panel to activate it.
4 
Move the cursor to the end of the fi rst clip. The cursor becomes the Rate Stretch tool (( ). )
5 
Click the end of the clip and drag the tool to the playhead until it snaps to the 
playhead.
Use the Rate Stretch tool to slow down or speed up a clip’s speed.

The Rate Stretch tool leaves a large gap between the two clips after you are done. 
Right-click in the gap and choose Ripple Delete from the menu that appears.
An alternative to using the Ripple Delete command is to manually select and drag the clips on your Timeline to remove gaps.
7 
When you change the speed of video footage, this change can often result in the video 
acquiring a jerky motion. To correct this, you can enable Frame Blending, a technique
that visually merges frames together to create a smoother transition between frames.
Right-click the fi rst clip, and from the menu that appears, choose Frame Blend.
8 
Press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to render all 
areas of the Timeline that need rendering. Premiere Pro automatically previews the 
Timeline when the rendering is done.
Notice that the clip plays back faster. Click on the Selection tool in the Tools panel to 
make it active.
9 
You can also adjust the playback speed of a clip on the Timeline with the Speed/
Duration dialog box:
In the Timeline panel, right-click the second clip and choose Speed/Duration from
the menu that appears.

10 In the Speed/Duration dialog box, you can adjust the clip by setting a new Speed
at which you want the clip to play, set a new fi nal duration, or reverse a clip to play 
backward to forward on the Timeline.
Change the speed of this clip by clicking the current Speed value and changing it to 
200; click the OK button. The clip plays back at twice the original speed.
You can also adjust the speed of a clip by
setting a new duration if you need to fi t 
the clip to a specifi c point on the Timeline.
11 Right-click the second clip, and from the menu that appears, choose Frame Blend.
12 Press the Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) key on your keyboard to render all 
areas of the Timeline that need rendering. Premiere Pro automatically previews the
Timeline when the rendering is complete.
As you can see, both clips now play back considerably faster than normal. You can use 
such eff ects as transitions or to bridge gaps between points in space or time in a story.
When you adjust the speed of a video clip, the resulting motion can appear jerky. You 
can compensate for this by enabling the frame blending eff ect.

See Lesson 11 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Output for the Web and desktop
In recent years, the Internet has become a popular medium in which to display video 
projects, especially because bandwidth has increased and the Internet off ers better support
for rich media. In addition, and with the proliferation of corporate video, Premiere Pro
can and has been used to create content for presentation graphics and mobile devices. 
However, Premiere Pro continues to be a tool for storytelling and a way of creating 
engaging video projects that you can deploy to any medium.
When you create video for the World Wide Web or for computer systems, you should 
be aware that there is no single standard for web and desktop video, and there are several 
types of video players, some of which are explained in the next subsections.
Flash video and the Flash player
Flash video is the native video format supported by the Adobe Flash platform and it is 
widely used in the delivery of online video content, which makes it the most ubiquitous 
video format on the Web. Flash video is widely used by companies and individuals for its 
ease of deployment and player customization.
Windows Media and the Silverlight player
Windows Media Video (WMV) is the video format created by Microsoft, the makers of 
the Windows operating system. A variation of WMV is used for Silverlight video, which 
has been used by companies such as NBC Sports for their live Olympics coverage and 
Netfl ix for delivering streaming video content. Windows Media is also a supported format 
on some multimedia players and mobile devices, such as the Zune and Windows-based
phones.
QuickTime video and the QuickTime player
The QuickTime format is controlled by Apple computers and for years was the de
facto standard for web-delivered video. The QuickTime player is freely available, it is
compatible with MAC and PC operating systems, and it is required to view QuickTime 
movie fi les. QuickTime video format is also supported on some mobile devices, such as the 
Apple suite of iPods and iPads. In addition, you must have this player when using Premiere 
Pro on a computer running the Windows operating system.

Understanding formats and codecs
265
Lesson 11, Outputting your Video
11
HTML5 Video
HTML5 (Hyper Text Markup Language) includes features that let you play video without
the need for a plug-in, such as Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight. Currently there are
two competing standards for native HTML5 video support: H.264 and OGG Theora. A 
disadvantage of native HTML5 video is that diff erent browsers could choose to support
one video standard over another. In addition to its use as one of the HTML5 video 
standards, H.264 video has also become a de facto format for desktop based distribution.
Since it’s tied to a single specifi c player like Windows Media or Apple QuickTime, you 
can play H.264 video using a wider variety of applications.
Understanding formats and codecs
The diff erence between codecs and video formats can be confusing. Most computer 
users are familiar with the term format when describing fi les. For example, people with a
t
design or graphics background are familiar with fi les of diff erent formats, such as JPEG
or TIFF; casual computer users are familiar with formats such as Word documents or 
PowerPoint fi les. However, when you are working with video, you need to understand 
more than the format. Video formats such as QuickTime, AVI, Windows Media, and Flash
Video are containers, much like a briefcase. The contents of the briefcase are written in 
a specifi c language that you need to understand. This is the relationship between formats
and codecs: formats are the containers, and the codecs are the language the contents are
written in.
Codec is a conjunction of the words compressor and
r
decompressor. Codecs are mathematical 
r
algorithms used to reduce audio and video fi les to manageable sizes. Video fi les can 
be very large; for example, 20 minutes of NTSC DV video from a standard defi nition 
miniDV camcorder is over 4 GB in size, which is the capacity of one single layer DVD. 
Without codecs, you could not easily store and save video footage for archiving, and you
could never watch video online, by e-mail, or on a mobile device. To view an audio or 
video fi le, you must have a player compatible with the format and you must have the same
codec used to compress it available on your computer so you can decompress it. 
For example, suppose a friend shoots a short video of his dog doing a back fl ip, edits it, 
adds background music and sound eff ects, creates a QuickTime Movie using the H.264
codec, and e-mails it to you. To view the video, you open the movie in the latest version of 
QuickTime Player, VLC Media player, or one of several other media players that support 
the playback of QuickTime fi les, and it plays without a problem: you are able to see the 
video because you have a player that is compatible with the QuickTime Movie format 
(.MOV) and you also have the H.264 codec installed on your computer. You probably 
didn’t install the codec yourself: Your operating system comes with some codecs installed 
and many popular media players automatically add additional codecs when you install them.
When working with video editing and animation programs, you might encounter issues
of format incompatibility that will not let you import or view specifi c fi le types; however,
often the problems are caused by missing or unsupported codecs.

266
Understanding temporal and spatial compression
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
11
Understanding temporal and spatial compression
There are two types of compression that video codecs use to reduce fi le sizes: temporal and 
spatial. Some formats use one or the other compression type, but most formats use both
types to reduce audio and video fi les to manageable sizes.
Spatial compression is very similar to the compression used in image formats such as JPEG 
and GIF. This image compression is usually lossy, works on each frame in a video fi le 
individually, and it is sometimes called intraframe compression.
Temporal compression, also called interframe compression, compares a video frame to 
the one preceding it and only saves the data that is diff erent between the two frames. 
This type of compression can become problematic if the original frames are removed or 
damaged.
As mentioned above, codecs can use either or both types of compression. Codecs that only 
use spatial compression, such as the DV codec, are preferable for editing because frames
can be independent from each other. Codecs that use temporal compression, such as 
MPEG-2, off er better compression ratios, but can be problematic for editing because of the
interrelationship between frames.
Understanding bit rate
Bit rate is the amount of data allocated to each second of video, and it is a major 
determinant of fi le quality. Usually the bit rate value is displayed as kbps (kilobytes 
per second); for example, the average bit rate of DVD video is 5,000 kbps. In general, 
the higher the bit rate of a video fi le, the better the quality will be. These are some 
comparative examples: Standard Defi nition DV 25 (mini DV) footage is approximately 
25,000 kbps; DVD quality video is approximately 5,000 kbps; VHS video has a bit rate of 
approximately 1,200 kbps. Understanding the relationship between a fi le’s bit rate and its
quality can help you determine the best export settings for your video project.
Understanding frame rate and resolution
Video is a series of individual images shown in quick succession. The frame rate of video
is measured by the number of frames it contains each second, and it is usually denoted as 
fps. Diff erent video standards have diff erent frame rates; some support a variety. American 
television is broadcast at 30 fps, PAL is 25 fps, and fi lm uses a frame rate of 24.

Understanding aspect ratio and pixel aspect ratio
267
Lesson 11, Outputting your Video
11
In design, resolution is a term that refers to pixel density: the number of pixels in a given 
amount of space, usually an inch, and denoted in ppi (pixels per inch). For example, 
images created for high-quality magazines are usually 300 ppi; images created for the Web 
usually have a resolution of 72 ppi. In the fi eld of video and digital photography, resolution
refers to the pixel dimensions of an image; in other words, the number of horizontal and
vertical pixels that compose the image. In this fi eld, ppi is not used to address resolution.
When creating or optimizing graphics in pixel-based programs, such as Photoshop, the default 
resolution for video graphics is 72ppi, as it is for web graphics. Vector-based applications, such as
Illustrator, don’t use pixels and only let you set the pixel dimensions of your project fi le.
Understanding aspect ratio and pixel aspect ratio
4:3
3:2
16:9
1.85:1
2.39:1
Diff erent devices and camera formats can often have radically diff erent aspect ratios.
Aspect ratio and pixel aspect ratio can be confusing when working with video formats. 
The aspect ratio, also called image aspect ratio, is the proportion of the width of an 
image to its height. This value is usually expressed as two numbers separated by a colon; 
for example, 4:3 or 1.85:1. Sometimes, aspect ratio can be referred to in more generic
terms, such as standard and widescreen mode. In videography, the two most common 
aspect ratios are 4:3 (sometimes denoted as 1.33:1) for standard defi nition display and 
16:9 (sometimes denoted as 1.78:1) for widescreen or high defi nition formats. Film uses 
diff erent aspect ratios than video and broadcast television; two well-known ones are 1.85:1 
and 2.39:1, which accommodate a wider vista and can better simulate human vision.

268
Understanding aspect ratio and pixel aspect ratio
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
11
The diff erences in aspect ratio become apparent when video is displayed on a television 
screen with an aspect ratio diff erent from that of the video itself. For example, when 
displaying widescreen video (16:9, 1.85:1, 239:1) on a 4:3 television or computer monitor,
the video covers the full width of the screen, but two black boxes appear at the top and 
bottom of the screen in a technique called letterboxing. You can see this eff ect when 
you play a fi lm transferred to DVD on a television or computer monitor. Footage that is 
created using a 4:3 aspect ratio, and then displayed on a widescreen device might appear 
with black bars to each side in a technique called pillarboxing. You can also have a video 
image that is displayed with simultaneous letterboxing and pillarboxing; this scenario is
called windowboxing.
Pillarboxing
Letterboxing
Pixel aspect ratio is the proportion of the width of the pixels that compose a video or 
still image to their height. A pixel is the smallest individual unit of a digital image; pixels 
can be of diff erent shapes and sizes. The pixels used by a computer monitor are square in
shape and have a pixel aspect ratio (par) of 1:1 (1.0); many of the standard video formats 
have rectangular pixels. For example, standard defi nition D1/DV NTSC footage has a 
par of 0.9 : 1 (.9); widescreen NTSC footage has a par of 1.21:1 (1.21); and high-defi nition 
HDV 1080 and DVCPro HD 720 have a par of 1.33:1 (1.33).

Pixel aspect ratio is the reason that NTSC and NTSC widescreen have the same pixel dimensions, but diff erent aspect ratios.
When footage is interpreted incorrectly, it can appear squashed or stretched, causing 
circular objects on screen to appear ovular. Graphics programs such as Photoshop create 
content using square pixels, but they have presets and previewing modes for video projects 
that provide a good representation of the graphics as they might appear on a television
monitor. When creating graphics in Photoshop and Illustrator, we highly recommend you 
use their video presets and choose one that matches your Premiere Pro sequence.

Progressive Display
Interlacing
Most modern televisions and other electronic display devices are progressive displays.
The two methods of displaying images on a video screen are Progressive display and 
Interlacing. In the United States, and before changing to a digital broadcasting system, 
televised images were sent as interlaced signals in which every frame of video was made by 
combining two half-images called fi elds.
Before the advent of high-defi nition LCD and Plasma screens, televisions were made by
wrapping a plastic or wooden frame around a large glass device called a Cathode Ray
Tube (CRT). These CRT television screens were composed of a series of even and odd
numbered lines called scan lines, and each frame of video was displayed by illuminating 
these lines starting at the top of the screen. Interlacing was created to display video signals
on this type of TV set and worked by illuminating one set of lines fi rst (even or odd
numbered), and then moving back to the top of the display to illuminate the other set. In
this way, the display would show the second set of lines when the fi rst set began to fade; 
the result was a complete picture for the viewer. This process occurred 60 times a second 
with NTSC broadcast television. Unlike Interlacing, Progressive display illuminates the 
scan lines sequentially from top to bottom.
Most modern televisions can display in interlaced and progressive mode, and the ATSC 
(American Television Systems Committee) includes broadcast standards for both, while
all computer monitors use progressive display only. The diff erence between the two 
display methods occurs in video camera formats as well; older NTSC or PAL cameras can
only shoot interlaced video, but many newer cameras let you choose between interlaced 
and progressive shooting modes, for example, 50i (25fps), 60i (30fps), 30p (30fps) or 24p
(24fps).

Apple TV, YouTube, Vimeo, TiVo, the iPod, and mobile phones.
In this section of the lesson, you will export a Premiere Pro sequence in a variety of 
formats.
You can fi nd all the fi les used in this project in the Werewolves in Central Park folder in
the Media Library. The Reporter at Crime Scene.avi fi le is located in the A Roll folder;
the remaining footage is located in the B Roll folder.

From the Premiere Pro welcome screen, click the Open Project button, or with 
Premiere Pro already open, chose File > Open Project. Navigate to the pr11lessons 
folder that you copied to your hard drive and locate the pr1101.prproj fi le. Double-
click the fi le to open it. This project contains a single sequence called Reporter at 
Crime Scene.
2 
Click the Timeline panel to make it active. The reason you want to make sure the 
Timeline is active is because you can use the Export command to export whatever is
selected; the Source Monitor, a clip in the Project panel or the Timeline.

In the Export Settings dialog box, choose H.264 from the format drop-down list on
the right to set the choices available in the Preset drop-down list. 
From the Preset drop-down list, choose Apple iPad 2, 3, 4, Mini; iPhone 4S, 5; Apple 
TV 3 – 1080P 23.976. Setting the preset fi lls in all the menus and switches to produce
video fi les optimized for display on this device.
This specifi c preset is designed to create a fi le that is compatible with the current 
generation of Apple devices. It preserves the high-defi nition size and quality of the 
footage, along with its framerate. Depending on your intended output destination, you
will want to choose a preset that best represents your own needs.

Click the name of the fi le adjacent to the Output name fi eld to open the Save As dialog 
box. Change the name of the fi le to Reporter at Crime Scene-iPad version, then 
navigate to the pr11lessons folder on your hard drive and click the Save button.
By default, the exported fi le is saved into the same directory as the last fi le you exported, and the fi le’s name is automatically set to 
the name of the sequence you are exporting.
6 
Click the Export button to begin the export process and the Encoding Status panel 
opens. This panel provides a status bar and a counter to show the estimated time
remaining until the completion of the encoding process.
When exporting, the application renders or encodes a video fi le with the settings you
specifi ed and saves it to your hard drive. Creating a video fi le from your Premiere Pro 
sequence can be both a time-intensive and processor-intensive process. The duration
of the encoding process depends upon the footage being encoded, the specifi c codec 
used, and the speed of your computer.
The dialog box closes once the process is complete.
7 
To preview the fi le, minimize the Premiere Pro application and navigate to 
the folder on your hard drive where you saved your fi le. Double-click the
Reporter at Crime Scene-iPad version.mp4 fi le to preview it in your default
video application.
8 
Return to Premiere Pro and choose File > Save As. In the Save Project dialog box 
that appears, confi rm that you are still in the pr11lessons folder, rename your fi le to
pr1101-working, and click the Save button.
Do not close this fi le; you will need it in the next part of the lesson.

B
A. Source and Output monitors. B. Export settings.
Source and Output Monitors: Use the Source and Output monitors to preview the 
sequence or clip you want to export. Use the work area bar at the bottom of this area to
preview and trim the source you are exporting. Drag the handles at either end of the bar and
click the Set In Point or Set Out Point buttons to change the duration of the exported fi le. 
Use the Source and Output tabs at the top of this section to switch the preview area from
your original source footage and the anticipated exported result.
Export Settings: Use the Export Settings area of the dialog box to specify settings ranging 
from the format and compression used in the exported fi le to the name and location to 
use when saving on your hard drive. The lower portion of this area is divided by a tabbed 
interface. Each tab contains the specifi c setting used to output the fi le. These settings vary 
depending on the format you choose, but Audio and Video and other similar settings usually
remain constant.
Filters: Use it to add a Gaussian blur to the fi nal exported fi le. You can use the Gaussian blur 
to remove graininess that might result from shooting footage in low light conditions.
Multiplexer: Use it to set the way in which the audio and video merge to form the output
fi le. This panel is not available for all output formats.
Video: Use it to specify the settings for the video portion of the output fi le; these settings 
range from frame size and frame rate to the type of compression and fi le bit rate.
Audio: Use it to specify the settings for the audio portion of the output fi le, for example, the 
audio channels to output, codec, and audio bit rate.
FTP: Use it to automatically set FTP information to immediately upload the exported fi le 
to a server. You can set an FTP server address and input login and password information for 
your destination server. This option uploads a copy of your exported fi le, not the original.

Creating a custom export preset
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
11
Creating a custom export preset
You can use Premiere Pro’s built-in presets for diff erent output requirements, but 
occasionally, you might have to create your own customized settings to output video. In
such cases, you will need to determine the video resolutions the target device supports; 
the best video format and codec to use; and the frame rates the target device prefers. 
Some useful sources of information are the device manufacturers’ websites, white papers, 
technical sheets, and encyclopedic or knowledge-based sites such as Wikipedia (wikipedia.
com).
In this part of the lesson, you will create and save a new preset for exporting video to 
display on a computer screen. You will reduce the output size of the video to compensate 
for diff erences between the size of the video frame and monitor display.
1 
With pr1101-working.prproj still open, if necessary, click the Timeline panel to 
highlight it and make it active.
2 
Choose File > Export > Media to open the Export Settings dialog box.
3 
In the Export Settings section of the dialog box, if necessary, set the Format drop-
down list to H.264, and the Preset drop-down list to Apple iPad 2, 3, 4, Mini; iPhone 
4S, 5; Apple TV 3 – 1080P 23.976 . If you are continuing from the previous part of 
this lesson, the menus will already be set to the last settings used.
We highly recommend you base your new export preset on an existing preset that 
matches some of the settings you expect to use, and then modify it as needed.
4 
Click the Output Name fi eld, navigate to the pr11lessons project folder, and change 
the fi le name to Reporter at Crime Scene-desktop. Click the Save button to
return to the Export Settings dialog box.
You can use the Output Name fi eld to specify the name and location in which to create the exported fi le.

There is a great deal of variation in the screen size of modern monitors. The video 
frame dimensions of this preset are 1920 × 1080, which can actually fi ll the entire 
screen for some users. To compensate for this you will reduce the video’s export
dimensions so that they are smaller. In the Video tab, confi rm that the link button ( ) 
to the right of the Frame Width and Frame Height values is enabled. This button
ensures that changes to either value result in a proportional change that will not distort 
the video. Click the value for the Frame Width property and change it to 1280 pixels. 
The Frame Height property value automatically changes to 720 pixels.
When enabled, the button to the right of the Frame Width and Height fi elds maintains their proportions.
You can click any empty area of the Export Settings dialog box to exit text editing mode.

Scroll the Video panel to the Bitrate Settings section. The original preset is designed for 
video displayed on electronic devices and streamed over Apple TV sets, and has a Target 
Bitrate of 5 Mbps and a Maximum Bitrate of 6 Mbps. The bitrate of a fi le contributes to 
that fi le’s size and quality. Raise the Target Bitrate to 8 and the Maximum to 10.
For a variable Bitrate fi les you can set values for both a target and maximum Bitrate for the encoded fi le.
The lower the bit rate of a fi le, the smaller the resulting fi le will be when stored on your hard 
drive or device. Notice that the reduction in bit rate produces a smaller estimated fi le size for 
the exported fi le. For future projects, we recommend that you experiment with diff erent devices 
and footage to fi nd the settings that work for you. For complex graphics, background, text, and 
transitions higher bit rates to display well when exported to video.
About bit rate
The bit rate, sometimes written bitrate, of a fi le determines how much data is used to display 
each second of that video fi le. When encoding video fi les, you can use a constant bit rate
(CBR) or a variable bit rate (VBR). A constant bit rate fi le uses a single bit rate for every
second of video; a variable bit rate fi le sets a range of usable bit rates the application can use
when encoding the video fi le. 
An important idea to understand when setting the bitrate for your fi le is that it doesn’t help you
to exceed the bitrate of your initial video footage. Bitrate is eff ectively the amount of information
you have to describe each second of video. Raising your output bitrate beyond the level of the
footage you are working with would result in a larger fi le but not a higher quality one.

Click the Save Preset button ( ) located to the right of the Preset drop-down list to
open the Choose Name dialog box. Change the preset’s name to 720P Desktop and
click the OK button to save the preset.
You can access custom presets from the Preset drop-down list just as you would built-in presets.
Don’t close the dialog box; you will need it to complete the next portion of this lesson.
Exporting with the Adobe Media Encoder
Earlier in this lesson, you exported footage directly from Premiere Pro. The problem with
this approach is that you cannot work with your editing application while the fi les are
rendered. A solution to this problem is to use Adobe Media Encoder for all Premiere Pro’s 
exporting tasks. You can send a fi le to the Media Encoder’s render queue and continue 
working in Premiere Pro. The Adobe Media Encoder is a separate application that exists 
not only to function as a render queue for Premiere Pro but also as a stand-alone media 
transcoder. This allows you to change media from one format into another without having 
to fi rst import the fi le into Premiere Pro.
In this part of the lesson, you will send a fi le from Premiere Pro to the Adobe Media 
encoder to be rendered.
1 
With pr1101-working.prproj still open, the Export Settings dialog box still active, 
and the Reporter at Crime Scene-desktop.mp4 fi le ready to be exported, you can 
begin this portion of the lesson.
If you skipped the previous portion of this lesson, you will want to set your format and 
preset menus now.

Confi rm that the Preset drop-down list is still set to the 720P Desktop preset you 
created in the previous part of the lesson.
3 
Click the Queue button at the bottom of the dialog box to add the current export job
to the Adobe Media Encoder Queue. After a few moments the Adobe Media Encoder 
application opens.
The Adobe Media Encoder is a render queue: you can add multiple export jobs to it and they will be completed in sequence.
4 
In the Media Encoder, click the Start Queue button ( ) to begin the video rendering 
process. The video is created using the settings specifi ed in Premiere Pro and saved 
into the folder you specifi ed in the Export Settings dialog box. The render progress is
visible in the Encoding panel in the Media Encoder.
5 
To preview the fi le, minimize the Adobe Media Encoder and Premiere Pro applications 
and navigate to the pr11lessons folder on your hard drive. Locate the Reporter at 
Crime Scene-desktop.mp4 and double-click the fi le to preview it in your default video 
application.
6 
Return to Premiere Pro and choose File > Save or press Ctrl+S (Windows) or 
Command+S (Mac OS) to save these changes to your project. You can now close this 
project; you have completed this lesson. Minimize Premiere Pro and return to the
Media Encoder and close it as well.

A major advantage and the main reason for using the Adobe Media Encoder is its render 
queue. You can add multiple fi les with the same or diff erent output settings to the Media 
Encoder, and the application will render them in sequence without any other input from you.
These export jobs are easy to add, remove, and adjust their settings.
A. Queue. The Render Queue panel displays all your current and pending render jobs. The 
Add Source button is used to add fi les to the queue, while the Add Output button is used to
add export settings (format, compression & destination) for your source fi le. This allows you 
to take a single source fi le and render out several diff erent versions of it if necessary.
B. Preset Browser. The Preset Browser panel contains all the video, audio, and image 
output presets that ship with the application as well as all the custom presets that you have 
created. You can use the Create New Preset button to create additional custom presets 
directly in the Media Encoder without having to open Premiere Pro.
C.Watch Folder. The Watch Folder panel is used to set a folder on your hard drive for the 
application to watch and automatically transcode video fi les that are added to it. You can use 
the Add Folder button to add a new watch folder, and then use the Preset menu to set the 
export settings you want to use for all fi les that the application detects in this folder. This is 
an excellent feature of the program for users who have to transcode fi les to multiple output 
formats for multi-platform distribution.
D. Encoding. The Encoding panel displays the status of the current encoding job. This
panel is blank until you actually begin to render the items in the queue.

What are the four major players in the web and desktop video deployment market?
2 
What are video codecs?
3 
What is the advantage of using the Adobe Media Encoder to export your project 
instead of using Premiere Pro?
Answers
1 
The four major players in the deployment of video to the web and desktop are Flash 
Video, Windows Media Video, QuickTime video, HTML 5 Video (H.264)
2 
The word codec is a conjunction of the words compressor and
r
decompressor. Codecs are
r
mathematical algorithms used to reduce audio and video fi les to manageable sizes so 
they can be displayed on the Web, e-mailed, or written to a DVD.

The Project panel is the central hub for all the work you do in Premiere Pro. Links to 
your media fi les are stored in this panel when you import them, as well as the content you
create with the application, such as titles and sequences. You can organize the panel by
creating bins. These are eff ectively folders that can hold clips, titles, sequences, and even
other bins.
Reference Monitor Panel
The Reference Monitor acts as a secondary Program Monitor. You can use the Reference 
Monitor to compare diff erent frames in a sequence or to view the same frame in diff erent
viewing modes; for example, you can use the Composite viewing mode side by side with
the Vectorscope.

Finding keyboard shortcuts
 Finding the keyboard shortcuts for a tool, button, or menu command is as easy as doing 
any of the following:
• For a tool or button, hold the pointer over the tool or button until its tool tip appears. If 
available, the keyboard shortcut appears in the tool tip after the tool description.
• For menu commands, look for the keyboard shortcut at the right of the command. 
• For the most-used keyboard shortcuts not shown in tool tips or on menus, see the 
tables in this article. For a complete list of default and current shortcuts, choose Edit >
Keyboard Shortcuts (Windows) or Premiere Pro > Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac OS)
• Use the search fi eld in the Keyboard Customization dialog box to fi nd specifi c
commands quickly.
 Customize or load keyboard shortcuts
 You can set shortcuts to match shortcuts in other software you use. If other sets are available, 
you can choose them from the Set menu in the Keyboard Customization dialog box.
 1 
For customizing keyboard shortcuts, choose one of the following:
 In Windows, choose Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts 
In Mac OS, choose Premiere Pro > Keyboard Shortcuts 
 2 
In the Keyboard Customization dialog box, choose an option from the menu:
 3 
In the Command column, view the command for which you want to create or change
a shortcut. If necessary, click the triangle next to the name of a category to reveal the 
commands it includes.
 4 
Click in the item’s shortcut fi eld to select it.
 5 
Type the shortcut you want to use for the item. The Keyboard Customization dialog 
box displays an alert if the shortcut you choose is already in use.
To erase a shortcut and return it to the command that originally had it, click Undo. To jump to 
the command that previously had the shortcut, click Go To. To simply delete the shortcut you 
typed, click Clear. To re-enter the shortcut you typed previously, click Redo.
6 
Repeat the procedure to enter as many shortcuts as you want. When you’re fi nished, 
click Save As, type a name for your Key Set, and click Save.
The operating system reserves some commands. You cannot reassign those commands to Premiere 
Pro. Also, you cannot assign the plus (+) and minus (-) keys on the numeric keypad because 
they are necessary for entering relative timecode values. You can assign the minus (–) key on the 
main keyboard, however.

Appendix C, Premiere Pro Input and Output formats
Supported formats for Input and Output
Premiere Pro can import and output a wide variety of diff erent video, still image and audio 
formats. With the assistance of third party plug-ins, many of which are automatically installed 
with the application the number of supported fi le formats is enhanced. Premiere Pro can 
only import the listed fi le types when the codec used with the fi le is installed locally on your 
computer.So in order to view or edit a fi le that has been encoded in the DivX codec, that
very same DivX codec must be installed on your machine.

Appendix D, Capturing and Transferring Footage
What you’ll learn 
in this lesson:
• Creating a new Premiere 
Pro project
• Adding bins and set a 
capture bin
• Capturing footage from 
a digital video camera
• Adding and editing 
metadata footage 
Capturing and 
Transferring Footage
In the previous lessons in this book, you worked with footage that 
was already captured or transferred from a recording source. In this 
lesson, you will learn to transfer the footage from your camera or 
storage card.
Starting up
In this lesson, you will work with the project fi les from the AppDlessons folder. Make sure 
that you have loaded the prlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. The 
Starting up section at the beginning of this book provides detailed information about loading 
lesson fi les, resetting your workspace, locating missing media, and opening the fi les in CC. If 
you have not already done so, please review these instructions before starting this lesson.
When opening the Premiere Pro project fi les used in this lesson you may experience a
missing media message. You must locate any missing media before trying to proceed through 
the lessons. For more information refer to “Locating missing media” in the Starting up 
section of this book.

Capturing from a tape-based camera
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
D
Capturing from a tape-based camera
If you are working with tape-based media, before you can add footage to a Premiere Pro 
project you must capture it from the digital tape-based medium where you recorded it, to 
a digital fi le on your hard drive. To complete the activities in this lesson, you need a digital
video camcorder or a video deck connected to your computer via a FireWire cable. FireWire
connections are very fast, but capture from a linear device, such as digital video tape, always
occurs in real time, so capturing 40 minutes of video takes 40 minutes to accomplish.
Video decks are the digital video equivalent of a VCR (Video Cassette Recorder). Video decks
have a FireWire or other connection to attach to a computer, some have a display screen, and they 
let video editors capture video without connecting a camera.
Before beginning the capture process detailed in this part of the lesson, you should perform 
the following steps to set up your FireWire equipped digital video camera or video deck and 
the tape you want to capture:
1 
Connect your camcorder or deck to your computer using a FireWire cable, also 
known as ieee1394 or iLink, and turn it on.
You can connect the FireWire cable when either of the devices you are connecting is on, but we 
strongly recommend turning the devices off  before connecting them to avoid possible damage to
the devices.
2 
Place the tape you want to capture from into your camcorder or video deck.
3 
If you are using a digital camcorder, set it to VCR mode to let Premiere Pro interact 
and control it.
4 
Move your camera’s playhead to the location on your tape that you want to capture from.

M. Capture Location. N. Device Control.
Video Preview: shows the video source from the camcorder or video deck when the video
is playing. When paused, the preview shows the video frame at the current position of the
playhead.
Camera/Deck status message: displays the status of the capture device.
Capture Setup: use it to specify the capture destination bin, called the Logging Bin, and the 
source media to capture (video, audio, or both). By default, the capture destination is set to
the root of the Project panel.
Clip Data: use it to specify the tape and clip names, add a description, log notes, and any 
other metadata that can be displayed in the Project panel once the clip is captured. You can 
use this information as part of the media management task to organize and rate footage for 
inclusion in a project.
Timecode: displays the current In and Out points set on a tape. Use these points during the 
logging process to defi ne diff erent clips or the areas on a tape that you can capture from, for 
example, a specifi c scene.
Capture: contains the commands to initiate the capture process. You can capture the entire
tape or only the area set by the current In and Out points in the Timecode area described
above.
Playhead Position: shows the current timecode position of the playhead.

Understanding the Capture panel interface (continued)
In Point: shows the currently set In point on the tape. You can set the In point when
logging or capturing only a portion of the currently loaded tape.
Out Point: shows the currently set Out point on the tape. You can set the Out point when 
logging or capturing only a portion of the currently loaded tape.
Duration: shows the duration of the video or the time between the current In and Out 
points on the tape.
Transport Controls: use them to navigate the tape in the Capture panel much as you would 
in the Source and Program monitors. You can play and pause the tape, initiate capture using 
the record button, fast forward or rewind the tape, move forward or back frame-by-frame, 
and use other navigational controls.
Capture Settings: use them to display and edit the type of capture (DV or HDV) you are 
performing. Found in the Settings tab.
Capture Location: use it to specify the location for captured footage on the hard drive. You
can confi gure these settings in the Scratch Disks tab of the new project dialog box, and later 
override them here as necessary. Found in the Settings tab.
Device Control: use them to specify the type of camcorder the capture panel will interact 
with. For most cameras, the standard, generic settings are enough to let Premiere Pro control
device playback. Occasionally, you might need to specify the manufacturer and model of 
your camera to allow device control. Found in the Settings tab.
Using the Capture panel
You can use the Capture panel to log and capture footage from digital video camcorders or 
decks. Logging is the process of reviewing and annotating every scene and shot recorded on a
g
tape. Capturing is the process of transferring the digital video from the tape where it is stored
g
in linear form to a fi le on your computer, where you can access each clip in a non-linear 
fashion. The term used is specifi cally called capturing instead of digitizing because modern 
video tape camcorders already record footage into a digital format.
When the cost of stable digital storage could not be easily aff orded, editors would log 
everything on a tape and only capture the needed footage. Now, high capacity hard disk 
drives are aff ordable and reliable, so many editors capture every piece of footage on a tape
and sort it after capturing. Premiere Pro can automatically detect diff erent scenes on your 
tape based on when recording was started and paused (every time you pressed the Record/
Pause toggle button on the camera) through a feature called Scene Detect, which can help
you sort and capture all footage on your tape.

Appendix D, Capturing and Transferring Footage

In this section of the lesson, we will demonstrate the capture of clips from a tape that
contains shots taken in and around the city of Boston, Massachusetts. You can adjust the clip
settings used in this exercise when you capture your own tapes; the specifi c values used in 
this section are for demonstration purposes only. Later in this lesson, you will discover how to 
work with non-tape based systems as many devices are now recording directly to removable
high capacity memory cards and integrated hard drives. 
Due to the nature of the tape-based capture process, this section of the book is intended to
be used more for informational purposes so that you have the knowledge to capture your 
own tapes rather than an actual step by step lesson. 
1 
With your project open, choose File > Capture to open the Capture panel.
If the capture panel does not detect a device, text at the top to the panel lets you know the capture device is offl  ine.
You can also press the F5 key to open the Capture panel.

2 
In the Capture panel, locate the Logging tab on the right and click the Video Capture 
bin in the Log Clips To menu.
Clips are placed in the root area of the Project panel by default. You can specify a diff erent bin to log clips to.
3 
Set your tape and clip names in the Clip Data section of the Logging tab. We 
recommend matching the name on the physical label on the tape so you can easily fi nd 
it should you need to recapture your footage due to loss or damage. 
For this example, we used the following settings:
Tape Name: Boston Travelogue Tape 1
Clip Name: Boston Sites
Description: Video taken of and around the city of Boston for use in Adobe 
Premiere Pro Digital Classroom.
The fi elds Scene, Shot/Take, and Log Note were not used for this footage. These
fi elds are often used when capturing dramatic or narrative works divided into scenes
and usually contain multiple takes for each scene.

Click the Tape button in the capture section of the dialog box to begin the capture
process. Premiere Pro automatically begins playback on the capture device.

Appendix D, Capturing and Transferring Footage
D
Capturing from an analog source
The process described in this lesson is only good for capturing footage that is already digital;
digital video tape from a FireWire equipped device. If you are working with analog footage 
from a VHS or Beta tape you can adjust this workfl ow to accommodate your needs. The 
process of digitizing footage from an analog video source, such as VCR or non-digital
camcorder, is similar to the process of capturing from a digital source. All analog devices
have a connection port, such as RCA or coaxial. To digitize from an analog source, you 
must connect it to a digital converter, such as a dedicated analog-to-digital media converter 
device, or a FireWire-equipped camcorder or video deck. Many camcorders and video
decks have analog inputs you can set to a bypass mode to pass video and audio signals to a
computer, thus allowing them to function as digital converters.
To convert an analog source to digital
1 
Attach your analog device to your FireWire-equipped camcorder or video deck, or to an
analog-to-digital converter.
2 
Attach your FireWire-equipped digital device to your computer and turn all devices on. 
If you are using a camcorder, confi rm that it is set to VCR mode.
3 
Open the Premiere Pro Capture panel and wait for it to detect your FireWire device.
4 
In the Device section of the Settings tab, change the device control from DV/HDV 
Device Control to None; you cannot rely on the camera control features of Premiere 
Pro when working with analog devices.
5 
Begin the capture process by clicking the Record button in the Transport controls and 
then pressing the Play button on your analog device. You should see the analog video 
playing in the video preview area of the Capture panel.
6 
When you have captured the part of your analog source that you need, click the Stop 
button in the transport controls and then stop your analog device.
Transferring from a non-tape based camera
Many of the cameras sold today store footage onto a variety of digital storage media and are 
not tape-based. These fi le-based camcorders are produced by diff erent manufacturers with 
their own specifi cations; some examples include the Panasonic P2 camcorders, AVCHD 
camcorders, Sony’s XDCAM HD and CDCAM EX camcorders, DSLR cameras and the
RED digital cinema cameras. The storage media used by these camcorders varies from hard
disk drives to optical media such as a DVD or fl ash memory cards like CF or SD cards.
As is the case with mini-DV tape-based devices, the tapeless camcorders perform the capture 
and digitizing process so you do not need to capture or digitize the fi les before importing 
them to Premiere Pro. The process of reading the data fi les from the recording media and
then converting it into a format you can use in your projects is called ingesting. Premiere Pro 
CS5 is designed to ingest and work with the native fi les of tapeless formats without pre-
importing conversions.

Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
D
Adobe provides specifi c guidelines and recommendations for working with footage from 
RED, XDCAM, and other tapeless formats at www.adobe.com.
You can import assets directly from the camcorder’s tapeless media, but best practice is to 
transfer the footage to your hard disk drive fi rst and then import it into Premiere Pro. Most 
tapeless cameras have a built-in USB port you can use for this purpose. For cameras that
record onto portable media, such as CF and SD cards, you can use card readers.

Attach your tape-based camcorder to your computer, and then capture your own footage.

Downloading the Adobe Encore Library Content
In this section of the book you will be working mostly with Adobe Encore. The 
application has a Library feature that allows you to access menu templates, buttons and
other functional content. If you have not already done so you can download this additional 
functional content by reviewing the Adobe help page on this topic at the following link:
http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/multi/library-functional-content-missing.html.
Understanding the DVD/Blu-ray/Flash authoring process
The process for authoring projects for use as DVD, Blu-ray disk, or Flash fi les (.swf) is
similar in all cases:
1 
Export a Premiere Pro sequence to a format compatible with DVD or Blu-ray disk.
2 
Create a DVD or Blu-ray disk Encore project.
3 
Import your video and audio fi les into the Encore project and add them to Timelines.
4 
Create menus with buttons, and then link the buttons to Timelines and other menus
to generate navigation.
5 
Output the completed project to a variety of formats, such as disk image, disk folder, and
Flash fi le (.swf); or burn a DVD or Blu-ray disk directly from the application.
You can author DVD or Blu-ray disk content in the Creative Suite using Adobe Encore, 
which is included as part of the Creative Suite Production Premium, and the Master 
Collection when you subscribe to the Creative Cloud and is included with Adobe 
Premiere Pro when you purchase it individually. However, it is important to keep in mind 
that Encore is not the only application that can be used to create DVD and Blu-ray disks. 
Premiere Pro can be used as a stand-alone application and you can always export video 
fi les from Premiere Pro and use a third-party application for your disk authoring.
Understanding DVD formatting
DVD is an acronym for Digital Video Disk (also known as Digital Versatile Disk); the 
technology was created in the mid-1990s by a group of companies that included Phillips 
and Sony. DVDs are a digital optical storage medium that uses laser to read and write 
data onto a disk. These disks can store a wide variety of content, including video, audio, 
and data fi les. DVDs intended for playback on a console or DVD player follow a specifi c 
convention: the video is encoded into the MPEG-2 format; menus and sub-menus can be 
included to navigate the content; and additional content can be added. The DVD is then 
written into a standardized fi le and folder structure and burned to a disk.
The Adobe Suite of products provides you with the end-to-end tools you need to create a 
DVD project.

About the project
323
Appendix E, Using Adobe Encore
E
Understanding Blu-ray formatting
Offi  cially released in 2006, the Blu-ray disk format was developed by the Blu-ray Disk 
Association, a group composed of consumer electronics makers, computer hardware 
makers, and elements of the fi lm industry. Blu-ray disks were created to supersede DVDs 
and become a distribution medium for high-defi nition digital content. As with DVDs, 
Adobe Encore off ers a wide range of tools for authoring content to display on Blue-ray 
disks. High-defi nition video content is usually encoded using the H.264 codec, but Blu-
ray technology supports MPEG-2 to maintain backwards-compatibility with DVDs.
About the project
In this lesson, you will learn to export sequences from Premiere Pro and use them to
construct a DVD project in Adobe Encore. You will build a DVD-based demo reel
composed of the projects you have worked on in this book. In the two following exercises, 
you will learn the two most common ways of transferring your sequences from Premiere 
Pro to Encore. The fi rst is a direct export that converts your sequence into DVD-
compatible audio and video fi les. The second option is called Adobe Dynamic Link
and it is a more direct alternative, but requires Adobe Premiere Pro purchased as part
of the Production Premium suite or Master Collection. Dynamic Link lets you use an 
unrendered, Premiere Pro sequence directly inside an Encore project, thus eliminating the 
need to pre-render your sequence into MPEG-2 format.
Exporting an MPEG-2 DVD fi le
Any MPEG-2 fi le works when creating a DVD, but for fl exibility, especially to add 
more than one audio track to your projects, we recommend using the MPEG-2 DVD 
export preset. This preset produces two separate fi les: the video portion of the exported 
sequence is written to an M2V fi le, and the audio portion of the sequence is written to a
separate WAV fi le. To use a third-party application to author your DVD content, use the
MPEG-2 DVD export preset to export your sequences.
In this portion of the lesson, you will open an existing Premiere Pro project and 
export an MPEG-2 fi le for use in your Encore project. You can fi nd the media for this 
section of the lesson in the Media Library folder. Locate the video used for this lesson, 
Central Park-NYC-Lake Scene.AVI and Central Park-NYC-Fountain Scene.AVI,
in the video sub-folder of the Travelogue-New York folder. You can fi nd the audio used 
for this project, Classical Background Music.mp3, in the Audio folder.

From the Premiere Pro Welcome screen, click the Open Project button, or with
Premiere Pro already open, chose File > Open Project. Navigate to the AppElessons
folder that you copied to your hard drive, and locate the AppE01.prproj fi le. Double-
click the fi le to open it. 
This project contains a single sequence called Lake Scene. There are some transitions
used in this sequence that you should render before exporting the fi le, as explained in 
the next step.

Creating a new Encore project
Encore is available as part of a suite of products and is also included with the individual 
purchase of Premiere Pro, so you can use Encore to author dynamic DVDs, Blu-ray disks, 
and Flash fi les (.swf). After importing media fi les into an Encore project, you can create 
menus step by step, or use pre-built templates that are PSD fi les familiar to Photoshop 
users. Encore lets you open a menu in Photoshop so you can use it to create new menus or 
enhance your existing menu content.
In this part of the lesson, you will create a new project and import the fi les you exported 
from Premiere Pro in the previous exercise. To continue this part of the lesson, please 
open Adobe Encore now.

The transcode settings control the way in which video brought into the project is converted into a
format compatible with DVD or Blu-ray.
When working in Encore, you can choose how to import diff erent types of footage:
you can indicate that a specifi c fi le be treated as a menu, pop-up menu, Timeline, or 
Slideshow. Menus are used when creating a DVD or Blu-ray disk project to allow you
to navigate to diff erent areas; they are what create the non-linear nature of the disk-
based experience. Pop-up menus are a special type of menu used only in Blu-ray disk 
projects. Timeline is where you place the audio and video resources that you wish a 
viewer to see, and fi nally slideshows are used to show a series of still images allowing 
you to author an image gallery on your disk.
Asset is the default option that you will use when importing audio and video content 
that you do not want to convert into a Timeline.

Creating a Timeline
Encore has Timelines that work somewhat diff erently from the Timelines in Premiere Pro. 
In Encore, Timelines hold video and audio fi les, but unlike Premiere Pro, you can only 
have a single video track per Timeline. However, Encore Timelines can have multiple
audio tracks, so you can have several language tracks. This is how DVD players can switch
between multiple dubbed language tracks on a single disk. Encore Timelines can also 
contain tracks for sub-titles.
In this portion of the lesson, you will create a Timeline for the four sets of video and audio 
clips you imported. For this DVD, you will have a single Timeline, and then use chapter 
markers to create the ability to navigate to diff erent points along the Timeline.

Creating Menus
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
E
Creating Menus
Menus are the basis for all navigation in a DVD or Blu-ray project:
•
They contain navigational buttons so viewers can access the project’s content.
•
They can be used to play a timeline, navigate to individual chapter points, navigate to 
other menus, or set the active audio and sub-title tracks.
With Adobe Encore, you can create custom menus using assets from the Encore Library, 
or edit those assets in Adobe Photoshop to create new and unique content. You can also
use pre-built menus downloaded from Adobe Resource Central, modify those pre-built 
menus in Photoshop, or create original menus directly from Photoshop PSD fi les.
All the menus installed with Encore or downloaded as templates from the Internet are 
native Photoshop documents (.psd), thus letting you customize existing content or create 
unique, new content from the beginning. Because the fi les are native Photoshop fi les, you 
can also use animation programs like Adobe After Eff ects to create motion graphics using 
the same assets available for your menus.
In this portion of the lesson, you will import and customize two Photoshop fi les already 
prepared for use as the main menu and sub-menu of this project.

Notice also that each button is contained within its own layer folder. Click the reveal
triangle to the left of the layer folder called (+) Special Features and notice that it is 
composed of a text layer and another layer called (=1) highlight. All the other button 
layer folders are created in the same way.
The (=1) highlight layer is only available when the button is 
activated during the DVD playback.
The special symbols at the beginning of the layer folders let Encore recognize these layers as buttons.

When editing menus in Adobe Photoshop, do NOT remove the special symbols at the beginning 
of the button names. You can easily add and copy button layer groups, but the special symbols
in the button names help Adobe Encore recognize the button type. Your buttons will not work 
without the symbols.
Linking menus to each other

A small play icon above the menu’s icon in the Project panel marks the menu as the fi rst play item.
3 
Choose File > Save, press Ctrl+S (Windows), or press Command+S (Mac OS) to save 
changes to your project. Do not close this fi le; you need to test it to ensure everything 
works properly.
Previewing a DVD
You can test your project at any point in the authoring process after setting your fi rst play
item. A good best practice to follow is to test throughout the authoring process to avoid
costly, time-consuming mistakes, and then again before releasing the project.
1 
With the Demo Reel.ncor project still open, click the Preview button in the Tools 
panel to open the Project Preview window.
2

Click the PLAY DEMO button to play the Demo Reel Timeline.
3 
After ensuring the button works, return to the menu by clicking the Remote Control 
Title Button at the base of the Preview window.
Use the controls at the bottom of the Preview window to simulate the buttons on a remote control.
4 
From the main menu, click the View Individual Clips button to navigate to the sub-menu.
From the project sub-menu, click the Reporter clip to navigate to the second chapter 
marker on the Timeline.
There might be a lag when the project is previewing. This is normal and depends on your system
confi guration.
Let the entire clip play to the end; notice that the next clip begins immediately. This is
not the correct behavior for this type of button; the clip should return to the sub-menu
after it fi nishes playing to allow the user to select a diff erent clip, not automatically start 
a new clip. You can correct this behavior by setting End and Override actions.

Setting End and Override actions

5 
Close the Preview window by clicking the Exit Here button on the lower-right side
of the window.
Choose File > Save, press Ctrl+S (Windows), or press Command+S (Mac OS) to save 
changes to your project. Do not close this fi le; you will need it open in the next part 
of the lesson.
Setting End and Override actions
You can use the End and Override actions to control the way in which the user navigates
from one section of a Timeline to another. You can apply End actions to Menus,
Timelines, and Chapter Markers to set the event that should follow when a specifi ed item
fi nishes playing. You can add Override actions to buttons to override the default end 
actions of items such as Chapter Markers.
For the exercise in this lesson, the PLAY DEMO button from the main menu should play 
the entire Demo Reel Timeline; the buttons on the sub-menu should navigate back to the
originating menu after the individual clips fi nish playing.
1 
With the Demo Reel.ncor project still open, click the fi rst Chapter Marker in the
Demo Reel Timeline to select it.
2 
In the Properties panel, set the fi rst marker’s End Action to go to the next clip on
the Timeline by choosing Demo Reel > Reporter from the End Action drop-down
menu.
3 
Click the second Chapter Marker and set its End Action to Demo Reel > Central Park.
4 
Click the third Chapter Marker and set its End Action to Demo Reel > Lake Scene.
5 
Click the fourth and fi nal Chapter Marker and set its End Action to Return to Last Menu.
This pattern sets the end action of each Chapter Marker to advance to the next clip on
the Timeline. The fi nal Chapter Marker’s End Action is set to return to the menu the
user was previously on.
The next step of this process is to assign actions to the buttons on the sub-menu to
override these end actions and return to the sub-menu when the specifi ed clip has
fi nished playing.

Outputting the project
Encore can create projects for distribution to DVD, Blu-ray, or the web. There are several 
options for distributing to optical disks; for example, you can burn a DVD or Blu-ray
disk directly from Encore; or create a disk image, master, or folder for use in a third-party 
authoring program. Regardless of the output format, you can use the Build panel to output
your project.
1 
With the Demo Reel.ncor project still open, click the Build panel to make it active 
and visible.
2 
From the Build Panel Format drop-down menu, choose DVD; from the Output drop-
down menu, choose DVD Folder.
Confi rm that the Source area drop-down menu is set to Create Using the Current
Project.
Your specifi c output format varies depending on your needs.
To burn a DVD directly from Encore, choose DVD Disk from the Output drop-down menu. 
The DVD output method you choose depends on the specifi c uses for the DVD disk: if you have 
a burner and want to make a test copy, choose DVD Disk. If you want your DVDs created at a 
replication facility, the facility should tell you the output they prefer.
3 
If necessary, use the scroll bar on the right side of the Build panel to reveal the disk’s 
Destination options.
In the Destination area of the panel, click the Browse button and choose a location to 
which to write your DVD folder. For this project, use the AppElessons folder as the 
destination.

356
Outputting the project
Adobe Premiere Pro CC Digital Classroom
E
Name the Project in the Disk Info section and set the size of the disk you are going to 
to burn. For example, the fi gure below shows the Disk name set to Demo Reel and 
standard single layer DVD as the output media.
A single layer DVD can hold 4.7 GB of data; a dual layer DVD can hold 8.5.
4 
Again if necessary, use the scroll bar on the right side of the Build panel to reveal the
disk’s Region Coding options.
In the Region Codes section of the panel, set the Region Coding you want to use. For 
example, to create a DVD without any regional restrictions, choose the All Regions 
option button. Any other choice will prevent the disk from playing back in DVD 
players that are set for any unchecked region.
Specify the type of Copy protection to use when creating your disk: you can set
the option to make zero, one, or an unlimited number of copies of a disk. For this 
exercise, disable copy protection to allow an unlimited number of copies to be made.
Region coding is a tool to prevent illegal pirating of DVD disks.

Click the Check Project button in the top-right corner of the Build panel to open 
the Check Project panel. Using this panel to check the project before building it is an 
optional step, but it is very helpful to double-check errors or omissions.
In the Check Project panel, click the Start button to begin checking.
Checking your project is an optional step you can perform at any point in the authoring process.
6 
For this exercise, the Project Check indicates that the Demo Reel Timeline does not
have an End Action set.
Click the error in the Check Project panel to see the Demo Reel Timeline properties
in the Properties panel. 
Set the Timeline’s End Action to Return to Last Menu, and then close the Check 
Project panel.
7 
Click the Build button on the Build panel to complete the DVD authoring process. 
A status bar appears on the screen to indicate the progress made. The time it takes to
build the DVD depends on the media used and the confi guration of your computer.
You can stop the Build process anytime by clicking the Cancel button on the status
bar.

A note about authoring Blu-ray disks and Flash fi les
Blu-ray disks were created to replace DVDs. With a capacity approximately fi ve times greater 
than dual-layer DVD disks, the Blu-ray disk off ers content creators the ability to author disks 
that can hold high-defi nition video content and allow for much greater depth to create
interactive branching experiences. The menu navigation for Blu-ray disks is built in the same 
way as DVDs, but the content fi ts one of the high-defi nition standards. Additionally, the high-
defi nition video you use in the project is encoded using the H.264 codec. 
Adobe Encore is not only a tool for creating DVD and Blu-ray disks; you can also output your 
projects to Adobe Flash. These interactive projects off er an alternative to the traditional optical
disk distribution. You can upload Flash projects to a web server and view them online as any 
other Flash-based content. You can author projects you want to output to Flash as you would
other projects; Flash is just an additional output channel for your work.
