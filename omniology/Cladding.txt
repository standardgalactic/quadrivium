Siding Patterns and
Applications
Redwood is synonymous with quality
architecture. No other siding material
adds value to a home or commercial
building like redwood. The value of
redwood’s beauty is immediately appar-
ent and the value of its long-lasting
performance is appreciated for decades.
Architects and builders specify redwood
with confidence, knowing that exceptional
performance is grown into every board
and that redwood will add value and
sales appeal to their projects.
Redwood’s Total Performance
Redwood’s performance characteristics
are unique among American softwoods.
Its superior stability is especially suited to
the demands of siding applications. Its
finish retention, weatherability, flame
resistance and insulation properties 
make it ideal for virtually any project and
even the most extreme climate.
Dimensional Stability Test reports from
the USDA Forest Products Laboratory
show that redwood has less volumetric
and tangential shrinkage than any other
domestic softwood. This means that
redwood siding will lay flat and straight
throughout the life of the structure with
minimal warping, cupping, checking and
nail popping. With tighter joints, redwood
provides better siding performance 
than other woods.
Finish Retention
Redwood has an open cellular structure
and contains relatively little pitch or
resins. This enables redwood to absorb
and retain all types of finishes better than
most other woods. As a result, projects
look better over a longer period of time.
Protective finishes last longer and work
better. Refinishing is required less often.
Resistance to Decay and Insects
Redwood heartwood has grown-in
resistance to decay and insects that is
present throughout the lumber, not just
on the surface. Wood exposed through
sawing, boring or nailing is as decay-
resistant as the surface.
The CRA trademark is on products of
member mills of the California Redwood
Association only and is an additional
assurance of quality.
Redwood grades are established by the
Redwood Inspection Service in the
Standard Specifications for Grades of
California Redwood Lumber. Properly
grademarked lumber will bear the RIS
mark. The RIS is the exclusive rules-
writing agency for redwood lumber.
Quality redwood siding is available in 
the architectural grades: Clear All Heart,
Clear, Heart B and B Grade.
Clear All Heart is a superior grade for
fine sidings and architectural uses. It is 
all heartwood and the graded face of
each piece is free of knots.
Clear is similar in quality to Clear All
Heart, except that it includes sapwood 
in varying amounts. Some boards may
have one or two small, tight knots on 
the graded face.
Heart B is an economical all-heartwood
grade containing a limited number of
tight knots and characteristics not
permitted in Clear or Clear All Heart. It 
is graded on one face and one edge.
B Grade is an economical grade con-
taining a limited number of tight knots
with sapwood accenting the heartwood.

Specifying 
Storage&Handling
Grain
Redwood lumber has either flat or vertical
grain. Siding Is considered vertical grain
when the annual growth rings form an
angle of 45 degrees or more with the
surface of the siding. If the angle is less
than 45 degrees, the siding is known 
as flat grain. Vertical grain siding pos-
sesses enhanced dimensional stability
and will hold paints and finishes better
than flat grain.
Vertical Grain
Flat Grain
Seasoning
Clear All Heart, Clear, Heart B and B
Grade sidings are available Certified Kiln
Dried for applications requiring minimal
shrinkage and top performance.
Redwood kiln dried to accepted stan-
dards will include the words “Certified 
Kiln Dried” or the initials “CKD” in the
grademark on each piece or package of
siding or be so specified on the invoice.
Patterns
Standard redwood siding patterns
include: bevel, rabbeted bevel, tongue
and groove, shiplap, channel shiplap and
V shiplap. Board and batten siding is 
laid up using standard size boards.
Pattern Numbers
Each siding pattern has a pattern num-
ber. To ensure delivery of the proper
product, the pattern number should be
included on specifications and invoices.
Pattern details are given in CRA’s
Architectural Guide and Redwood
Pattern Book.
Textures
Surfaced sidings have a smooth, planed
face, emphasizing the wood’s grain
and color.
Saw-textured sidings have resawn faces
providing a rough textured appearance
that holds finishes extremely well.
Specifying Redwood Siding
To ensure delivery of the proper siding
product, the specifications should
include: use, grade, grain, seasoning,
pattern description and number, and
surface texture.

In addition, the Installation section of the
specification should specify: non-corro-
sive fastener materials, type and size;
bearing and fastener spacing require-
ments; water repellent application as ap-
propriate, and field priming of cut edges.
Storage and Handling
Redwood siding and trim are quality
finish products and should be handled
with care. At the job site, redwood siding
should be kept completely under cover
and off the ground. Water-proof cover-
ings should allow air to circulate between
the covering and the siding. Keeping the
siding clean and dry will help to eliminate
the possibility of finish problems. For
protection, redwood siding is now avail-
able wrapped in moisture-proof paper at
the sawmill and it should not be un-
wrapped until installation begins.
Priming
It is recommended that a water repellent
containing mildewcide be applied to all
surfaces of redwood siding before
construction begins. This will inhibit the
movement of moisture as well as mildew
growth, two conditions which can
severely damage a finish coating. When
a clear, bleached or semitransparent
finish is to be applied later, a preliminary
coat of water repellent will protect 
against weathering and construction
staining prior to final finishing. For best
performance, special care should be
given to end grain; cut ends should be
coated before installation. Redwood
siding should always be back-primed. 
Factory priming or pre-finishing is 
highly recommended.
Application
General Application Information
Careful attention to construction detailing
is necessary to prevent moisture pene-
tration into the siding and the wall cavity.
Flashing over window and door headers
and at other horizontal siding breaks
should be sufficiently sized, well placed,
tightly anchored and sealed with caulk-
ing. Thorough caulking of all joints with a 
non-hardening compound is important,
particularly at the butt joints of short
length siding laid vertically. High per-
formance caulks such as polyurethane,
polysulfide or acrylic latex are recom-
mended for best results.
The lowest edge of siding should be at
least 6 inches off the ground to prevent
moisture problems. It is particularly
important that end grain at the bottom 
of vertical siding be coated with water
repellent. The use of a drip cap at the
lower edge of the siding is recommended.
A water repellent building paper, with a
permeability rating of at least 5 perms,
should be applied over sheathing. This will
help reduce water and wind penetration.
Note: There have been reports of prob-
lems arising from the combination of
wood siding and rigid plastic foam
sheathings. CRA advises caution.

Foam Sheathing.

Measuring and Cutting
All butt joints must occur over a stud or
solid blocking. Be sure that siding fits
snugly against corner strips and trim.
Mitered corners, sometimes used with
thicker patterns, should be cut in a miter
box. Plain bevel siding requires a com-
pound miter. Predrill nail holes for all
ends, especially mitered ends.
Using bevel cuts at a 45° angle (see
illustration) can minimize the appearance
of gaps if end shrinkage does occur.
Do not reduce CRA lap recommenda-
tions as this can result in damage from
wind-driven water. Carefully observe
expansion clearance requirements for 
the siding pattern selected.
Nailing
Nailing recommendations refer to nailing
siding to every stud or (for vertical cours-
ing) each 2x4 blocking line, at not more
than 24 inches on center.
Selection of proper nails is important.
Siding nails with annular-ringed shanks
provide the best holding power. All nails
must be either stainless steel, aluminum
or top-quality, domestic, hot-dipped gal-
vanized. Electroplated galvanized nails
are not recommended. Poor quality 
nails will react with redwood’s natural
decay-resisting extractives, and will cause
unsightly stains.
Nails can be countersunk (not more than
1/16 inch) or driven flush with wood sur-
faces. Unfilled nail holes may not be par-
ticularly noticeable where natural finishes
are used as long as proper quality nails
have been used. At mitered corners, or
near the edge or end of a piece, pre-drill
the nail hole to avoid splitting the wood.
Nails must be long enough to penetrate
into studs (or stud and wood sheathing
combined) at least 1-1/2 inches. Do not
fasten siding to only composition or
pressed fiber sheathing as those materi-
als provide no nail-holding power.
Do not use staples for redwood siding.
Staples do not provide adequate 
holding power and most are not 
corrosion-resistant.
Preventing Moisture Problems
Proper interior and exterior wall construction
prevents moisture problems. Building paper
should have a permeability rating of 5 perms,
the vapor barrier, a maximum of 1 perm.
Moisture is the largest cause of siding
and finish problems. Most problems can
be avoided if precautions are taken
during construction. Understanding the
dynamics of wood’s reaction with mois-
ture will be the builder’s best protection
against callbacks.
New energy-efficient construction tech-
niques increase the amount of humidity
within homes and commercial buildings.
Efficient insulation, storm windows,
weatherstripping, as well as heating
equipment and appliances that retain
warmth add to the build-up of interior
moisture vapor.
This invisible moisture is one of the least
understood and most troublesome
causes of structural and finish failures. It
moves as invisible moisture vapor from
the warm interior of the house toward the
cold exterior. Vapor travels through
plaster, insulation and wood and may
condense into water as it approaches the
colder exterior surfaces of the sidewall.
This can sometimes result in structural
damage as well as siding cupping and
nail popping. Water entering the siding
can also cause finishes to blister, peel
and discolor.
Vapor barriers are necessary to prevent
migration of moisture vapor. They must
be applied to the warm side of the stud
wall, directly under the finish material.
There are several types; the most fre-
quently used are either plastic or alu-
minum sheet material with a rating of 
one perm or less. Those sheets should
overlap at least 2 inches at their edges.
Ordinary building felt is not a vapor barrier.
When residing an existing house without
a vapor barrier, an effective solution can
be to paint the inner side of the exterior
walls with a vapor barrier paint.
Attic areas should be adequately vented
to prevent vapor from condensing on 
cold surfaces or penetrating through the
ceiling. Critical sources of humidity, such
as kitchens, baths and laundries, are 
best ventilated by fans that exhaust out-
doors. Crawl spaces should be well
ventilated all around the house; the vent
area should equal about 1/50th of total
floor space. Keep vents free of obstruc-
tions. Movement of vapor into stud
spaces from crawl spaces may take
place as water evaporates from the
ground under the house, and can be
retarded by laying polyethylene film 
over the ground. Basements may be a
source of considerable dampness and
require effective ventilation.

Bevel & Rabbeted
Bevel Patterns
Redwood bevel siding, also known as lap
or clapboard siding, has the timeless
appeal of a strong traditional style and
provides the deepest horizontal shadow
line of all siding patterns.
Bevel siding is produced in both plain 
and rabbeted patterns. Each is available
in two different butt thicknesses for
variation in depth of shadow line and
insulation value.
Plain bevel patterns produce a bolder
shadow line than rabbeted bevel pat-
terns of the same thickness. Rabbeted
bevel, with its 1/2-inch rabbet milled 
to fit over the thin edge of the preced-
ing course, allows the siding to lay 
flat against the studs or sheathing.
Rabbeted patterns provide a weather-
tight lap and lay up with greater coverage
than plain patterns.
Availability
Bevel and rabbeted bevel sidings are
available in all architectural grades.
Plain bevel siding has a smooth surface
on one face and a saw-textured surface
on the other face. Either face may be
exposed. Rabbeted bevel siding is
available with either a smooth or saw-
textured face. Saw-textured faces are
more even in color and appearance and
they hold finishes better.
Installation
With plain bevel patterns, use a furring
strip to support the lower edge of the
starting course. With rabbeted patterns,
the bottom course should be supported
by a nailing strip sawn from the thin 
edge of the pattern. Nail bevel siding at
every stud, which should not exceed 24
inches on center.
For plain bevel siding, a lap of one inch is
required to ensure weather-tightness.
Note: With CKD rabbeted bevel patterns,
an expansion clearance of 1/8 inch is
required in the rabbet.

Tongue & Groove
Redwood tongue and groove siding is
versatile and weathertight. Its variety 
of refined patterns has established a 
permanent place in residential and 
commercial architecture. Tongue and
groove siding can be laid up vertically,
horizontally or diagonally and is ideal for
matched interior-exterior combinations.
Tongue and groove patterns are pro-
duced in square edge, eased (slightly
rounded) edge and various widths of 
V groove edges. The latter create a
shadow line emphasizing the direction 
of the courses. Various design effects 
are achievable by alternating patterns
and board widths.
Availability
Tongue and groove sidings are available
in all architectural grades.
Standard tongue and groove patterns
come from the mill with a smooth surface
on both faces. Reversible patterns are
saw-textured on one face and surfaced
smooth on the other. All tongue and
groove siding patterns can be special
ordered saw-textured. Saw-textured
faces are more even in color and
appearance and they hold finishes better.
Tongue and groove redwood is also
available in thinner patterns commonly
used for interior paneling.
Installation
Tongue and groove siding is properly
applied with the groove edge down; this
assures a weathertight wall.
Horizontally-applied tongue and groove
siding should be nailed at every stud, 
not exceeding 24 inches on center.
Siding applied vertically should be nailed
to 2x4 horizontal blocking that is
installed between the studs at not more
than 24 inches on center. As an alterna-
tive, vertical siding may be nailed to 1x3
furring strips and solid wood sheathing at
24 inches on center.

nails per bearing.
For 4-and 6-inch widths of tongue and groove
siding over solid wood sheathing, blind nailing
is possible using one 8-penny finishing nail
per bearing.

Shiplap &
Channel Shiplap
Redwood shiplap patterns are widely
used for siding and paneling because 
of the varied visual effects that can be
achieved. The boards are self-aligning,
which makes installation easy. Shiplap
patterns form strong, deliberate 
shadow lines.
Shiplap siding in V channel, Cove and
Boston shiplap patterns can be applied
either horizontally or vertically. Square-
edged channel shiplap patterns should
only be applied vertically.
Availability
Shiplap sidings are available in all archi-
tectural grades.
Standard shiplap siding has a smooth
finish on both sides, except those pat-
terns designated with the suffix R, which
are reversible. Those have a saw-textured
channel pattern on one side and a smooth
finish V pattern on the other. Shiplap
siding patterns can be special ordered
with a saw-textured face. Saw-textured
faces are more even in color and
appearance and they hold finishes better.
Installation
Shiplap sidings applied horizontally start
with the bottom course and are nailed at
each stud, which should not exceed 24
inches on center. Channel shiplap pat-
tern sidings require a 1/8-inch expansion
clearance in each joint.
Shiplap siding applied in vertical courses
should be nailed to 2x4 horizontal
blocking that is installed between the
studs at not more than 24 inches on
center. As an alternative, vertical siding
may be nailed to horizontal 1x3 furring
strips and solid wood sheathing at 24
inches on center.

Board & Batten
The popular board and batten siding
styles are not, strictly speaking, siding
patterns but are created using standard
size lumber. Any number of interesting
treatments can be created, including
various width battens over wide board,
even spaced board and batten, and
reverse board and batten.
Availability
Any clear or tight-knot grade of redwood
lumber may be used, either with smooth
or saw-textured face. Clear All Heart,
Clear, Heart B and B Grade lumber is
available Certified Kiln Dried.
Installation
Board and batten patterns should only be
applied vertically. Boards should be
nailed to horizontal blocking placed not
more than 24 inches on center. As an 
alternative, 1x3 or greater horizontal 
furring strips may be applied over solid
wood sheathing.
Sample Specification
Exterior siding shall be CRA-RIS grade-
marked redwood, B grade, mixed grain,

Siding Finishes for Redwood 
Description
Application
Maintenance
Clear Water Repellents with
Mildewcide
Stabilize color at a buckskin tan and let
the grain and texture show through.
Minimize the effect of weathering and
redwood’s natural darkening.
Apply with brush or roller. Two coats
recommended for new wood. Coat sawn
ends, backs and edges before nailing
siding in place.
Reapplication required after old finish
has lost its effectiveness. Reapplication
may be required every 18-24 months.
Bleaching or Weathering Stains
Provide a gray, natural weathered
appearance. Bleaches accelerate the
natural color changes of wood.
Apply with brush or roller. Use one or
two coats according to directions.
Bleaching action may be aided by
periodically spraying surfaces with water.
Bleaching stains provide low mainte-
nance. Periodic reapplication of clear
water repellent with mildewcide is
recommended.
Semitransparent Stains
Variety of colors are available in these
finishes that let the wood grain show
through. Oil-based stains are recom-
mended for best performance.
Apply with brush for best results, roller
next best applicator. Two coats usually
required for new wood; follow manu-
facturer’s directions.
Color may wear away after weathering.
Refinishing may be necessary every 
2-4 years. Remove loose dirt and old 
finish with bristle brush before refinishing.
Solid Body Stains
Available in a variety of opaque colors.
These finishes obscure the grain and
have an appearance similar to paint.
Latex stains should be applied over a
compatible stain-blocking primer.
For best results apply with brush. Avoid
drips and lapmarks. Two coats usually
required for new wood; follow manu-
facturer’s directions.
Color may wear away with age.
Refinishing may be necessary every 
3-5 years. Remove loose dirt and old
finish with bristle brush before refinishing.
Paints
Durable attractive finishes for traditional
exteriors. Paints obscure the grain and
the texture of the wood.
Apply with brush for best results. Roller
is next best applicator. One prime coat and
two finish coats are recommended. Back-
priming required. Use oil- or alkyd-resin
base primer and acrylic latex top coat.
Repaint one coat after most of old coat
has weathered. Avoid creating an ex-
cessively thick paint film. Sand or scrub
with bristle brush to remove old finish
and dirt. Countersink nails if sanding.
Caution: Varnishes, lacquers and clear
film-forming finishes deteriorate rapidly
in moisture and sunlight, so they should
not be used.
