Answers and Explanations 
 
1. B: The discount the investor would receive is the difference between the current market price of 
stock XEC and the subscription price offered in the rights offering. 
           
 
2. D: Stock certificates contain a Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures 
(CUSIP) number, the number of owned shares, the owner’s name, and the issuer of the shares. 
 
3. A: A 2:1 stock split dictates that, for every share an investor owns, they will now own two. 
Further, the per-share price gets split in half due to the additional shares that resulted from the 
split. The investor’s overall position value in stock XEC, however, does not change. 
 
4. D: Corporations choose to repurchase shares in an effort to maintain a majority interest and 
control in the company and to fund future mergers. They would not repurchase shares to decrease 
a company’s issued stock in that issued stock is all stock sold to the public regardless of whether it 
remains outstanding or is repurchased; that is, the number cannot be decreased. Additionally, they 
would not repurchase shares to maintain their earnings per share due to the fact that a repurchase 
would reduce the amount of outstanding shares, which would consequently increase the company’s 
earnings per share. 
 
5. B: A security must be transferable from one individual to another and exposes the owner to risk 
and loss. Variable annuities are securities because they are transferable and, due to their payments 
being varied and unpredictable, expose the owner to some financial risk and variability in returns. 
Fixed annuities are not securities in that they provide for fixed payments, a guarantee on the 
receipt of earnings and principal, and consequently, no risk to the owner. Individual retirement 
accounts (IRAs) are not considered securities in that they provide for regular and predictable 
distributions to the owners, and thus, no risk. 
 
6. C: Investors’ rights expire only after 45 days. Additionally, investors may choose to exercise the 
rights to purchase additional shares or sell those rights to another investor who would like to buy 
those shares. 
 
7. D: Common stockholders have the right by ownership to vote on proposed stock splits, corporate 
bond issuance, and the election of the corporation’s board of directors. 
 
8. C: Equity is interchangeable with the term stock, provides ownership for the investor, has no 
maturity, and is sold in order to provide capital to the issuing corporation. 
 
9. D: A shareholder’s preemptive rights provide for him or her to receive the first option to 
purchase shares from any new offering conducted by the corporation, provide for the shares to be 
offered to the public only after they’ve been declined by the current shareholders, and require 
approval from the current shareholders for any increase to the amount of the corporation’s 
authorized shares. 
 
10. B: Stockholders are allowed only one vote for every share owned. The statutory method 
provides for voting equal amounts of votes over more than one candidate, the cumulative method 
involves casting all votes for one candidate, and there are two methods for stockholder voting, 
statutory and cumulative.

11. A: Stock that is authorized for sale and sold to investors is issued stock, regardless of whether it 
still remains with investors or has subsequently been repurchased by the corporation. Authorized 
stock is the largest number of shares that can be sold by the corporation. Treasury stock is the stock 
that has been sold to the public and then repurchased by the corporation. Outstanding stock is 
stock that has been sold to investors and still remains with investors, having not been repurchased 
by the issuing corporation. 
 
12. C: The results of a stock split would be a change in the number of shares (either an increase or 
decrease), while holding constant the value of the overall holdings. The split causes an increase or 
decrease in the number of outstanding shares and, accordingly, the stock’s price. The value of the 
holdings is not affected. 
 
13. B: Corporation PPG’s current amount in treasury stock is 5 million, given that treasury stock is 
defined as the amount of stock once sold to the public and then repurchased by the issuing 
corporation. The amount of outstanding shares is 12 million, and 17 million is the total amount of 
issued stock. 
 
14. A: In a rights offering, stock shares trade cum rights after the declaration of the rights offering, 
and the underwriting investment bank does have the option to purchase any shares not purchased 
by the rights holders. Further, rights are issued per share, one to one, and after the ex-date, the 
stock will trade without the rights attached, and accordingly, the stock’s value will be reduced to 
account for the loss of that right. 
 
15. C: The statutory voting method requires that the investor cast his or her votes equally amongst 
the candidates for which they would like to vote. 
 
16. A: The declaration date is the date when the board of directors declares the decision to pay out a 
dividend to common stockholders of record. The record date is when investors must be officially 
recorded as stockholders on stock certificates in order to qualify for receipt of the declared 
dividend. The ex-dividend date is the first day that the stock trades without the declared dividend 
attached and, accordingly, will not be given to anyone purchasing the stock as of this date or after. 
 
17. D: Investors of American depositary receipts (ADRs) are subject to the risk of permanent loss of 
their invested capital due to a company’s decline having long-term effects on their ability to 
successfully conduct their business. Further, currency risk as a result of currency fluctuations and 
the volatility risk associated with stock price fluctuations are also risks inherent to ADR ownership. 
 
18. B: Shareholders will retain proportionate interest in residual assets in the event of bankruptcy, 
may receive a list of shareholders, and may inspect a corporation’s books and records. They do not 
have the right to access and review a corporation’s confidential financial information. 
 
19. D: The settlement date is three business days after trade date. The payment date is when 
payment is due to the broker and is also five business days after trade date. The execution date for 
the trade order is the trade date. 
 
20. A: A violation of Regulation T has consequences that include the firm selling the securities from 
the unpaid order after the sixth business day following trade date, not the third, and for 90 days, the 
customer must pay up front for any purchases made through firm. The customer will be fully 
responsible for any loss incurred by the firm in selling off the securities from the unpaid order; 

- 101 -

however, the firm may sell any other securities from that customer’s account in order to provide 
financial settlement for the loss. 
 
21. D: A registered representative would be committing a violation by rushing a customer to make a 
purchase solely to meet the ex-dividend date, recommending a purchase simply to benefit from a 
pending dividend, or promoting a stock by highlighting the benefit of the pending dividend while 
neglecting to educate him or her as to the fundamentals or appropriateness this stock may have as 
an investment. 
 
22. B: Ownership in preferred stock provides a fixed income to the investor through dividend 
payments. The par value of shares is generally $100, not $1,000. Due to the fixed income nature of 
these shares, they are more sensitive to changes in interest rates, demonstrating an inverse 
relationship between rates and pricing. These shares have no maturity date and are therefore 
considered perpetual. 
 
23. C: In the event of a corporation’s liquidation, common stockholders are paid last, not second or 
third, in the line of other creditors and investors. Other risks include no payout of stock dividend 
and the fall of the stock price. 
 
24. A: The warrant will expire when the current stock price is below the subscription price of the 
warrant. The investor may also sell the warrant to another investor or exercise the warrant in 
order to purchase common stock at the subscription price. 
 
25. D: 
                    
 
Cumulative preferred shareholders always have priority over common stock shareholders in terms 
of dividend payment. They must receive both the missed dividend amounts as well as the current 
year’s before PIX can pay any dividend to its common shareholders. 
 
26. B: A warrant for stock PIX would be more valuable than a right due to its longer life and would 
provide the opportunity to purchase stock PIX for possibly up to 10 years at the subscription price. 
Its subscription price, however, is set above the current market value of stock PIX at the time of the 
warrant’s issuance, and further, the warrant provides the holder the chance to purchase PIX 
common stock, not preferred. 
 
27. A: Securities are transferable only after the owner either endorses the stock certificates or signs 
a power of substitution into the new owner’s name. Owners may sell shares without the approval of 
the requisite issuing organization, securities transfers are executed in the secondary market, and 
broker dealers assist in the securities transferring process. 
 
28. B: In the event a corporation pays a cash dividend to investors, an investor may receive that 
payment as a credit to his or her brokerage account as applied by the brokerage firm or as a check 
for that amount sent directly to him or her from the corporation paying the dividend. A brokerage 
firm holding the shares in a street name would not send the investor a check in that amount 
directly. 
 
29. C: A transfer agent does not verify company debt; this is the role of the registrar. A transfer 
agent does maintain the list of stockholders, verifies the correct issuance of shares, and handles the 
new issuance of stock certificates.

30. A: 
               
             
                     
 
                        
  
             
 
31. C: Participating preferred stock ownership provides the investor the right to receive both the 
preferred and common dividend when paid. Cumulative preferred shares not only allow the owner 
payment of the preferred dividend but also provide protection against missed dividend payments 
by requiring back payment of those dividends. Callable shares afford the corporation the right to 
call in those shares, often at a premium price. Convertible shares allow for the option to exchange 
preferred shares for common shares at a conversion price. 
 
32. D: An investor may obtain a warrant as attached to a bond purchased in a bond offering, 
purchased in the secondary market, or issued to him or her due to participation in a corporation’s 
initial public offering (IPO). 
 
33. C: Stock market prices, permits for building, and changes in business and consumer borrowing 
are all considered to be leading economic indicators in that they each act as signals of an impending 
change to the economy and, accordingly, can be observed prior to the actual change. Corporate 
profits and losses are considered to be lagging economic indicators in that these types of effects are 
more observable after the change in the economy has already occurred. 
 
34. A: On a corporation’s balance sheet, assets minus liabilities represents both the corporation’s 
net worth and its shareholders’ equity. A corporation’s retained earnings are the balance of net 
income beyond what may be paid out as dividends. Current liabilities are the financial obligations of 
the corporation that come due within the next 12 months. 
 
35. D: The Federal Reserve may alter the level of money in circulation, actively transact in U.S. 
government securities in the open market, and publicly share its views on the economy and the 
direction it sees it taking. 
 
36. A: In analyzing the overall condition of a country’s economy, an economist would be least likely 
to utilize oil prices, and MORE likely to look to charts and models regarding supply and demand, the 
country’s gross domestic product (GDP), and fluctuations in its business cycle. 
 
37. C: The measure of money supply that includes time deposits greater than $100,000 is M3. It also 
includes all the measures in M1 and M2. 
 
38. B: The Federal Reserve, in attempting to stimulate the economy, would reduce the reserve 
requirement, not increase it. Reducing it would allow for an increase in banks’ abilities to lend, a 
reduction in interest rates, increase in demand, and ultimately, the economy being stimulated. The 
reserve requirement involves a percentage of a member bank’s depositors’ assets to be placed in an 
account with the Federal Reserve. Further, altering the reserve requirement is the least utilized 
action to influence monetary policy that the Federal Reserve has at its disposal. 
 
39. C: Property, when categorized on a corporation’s balance sheet, is considered a fixed asset. 
Other assets can include a corporation’s trademarks, patents, and goodwill.

40. D: Fundamental analysts will refer to company income statements, liquidity ratios, and 
valuation ratios in trying to determine a stock’s value. 
 
41. A: Disintermediation involves investors moving their money from low-yielding accounts to 
higher-yielding ones. A contraction occurs when gross domestic product (GDP) and the stock 
market fall, while unemployment rises. Deflation is an economic condition that results from a 
decrease in demand for goods and services and consequently involves a decrease in prices for those 
same goods and services. 
 
42. C: A real estate investment trust (REIT) will NOT be held responsible for paying corporate taxes 
if their shareholders receive at least 90 percent of the REIT’s taxable income, and real estate is the 
source of 75 percent of the REIT’s income. 
 
43. A: If the Federal Reserve were to increase the discount rate, all other rates would go up, demand 
would decrease, and ultimately, the economy would be slowed. 
 
44. C: Falling interest rates will have a positive effect on stock market performance. An increase in 
taxes, or a reduction in the money supply or government spending, will negatively impact the stock 
market. 
 
45. B: The value of a country’s produced goods and services is its gross domestic product (GDP). 
Disintermediation involves investors moving their money from low-yielding investments to higher-
yielding ones. The real GDP is a deflation- and inflation-adjusted version of the value of a country’s 
produced goods and services. The consumer price index (CPI) is a tool utilized to measure the rise 
and fall of overall prices in the country by monitoring the price changes of a specific group of goods 
and services chosen for their high degree of use in individual lives. 
 
46. A: Lagging indicators take effect after the new direction of economy takes effect, take hold for a 
period of time, and provide confirmation about that change. Coincident indicators are an immediate 
result of even slight changes in the economy. Leading indicators occur prior to the economic change 
and can be looked to in order to analyze the future state of the economy. 
 
47. B: Repurchase agreements with maturities of greater than one day would be categorized as M3, 
not M2. Negotiable CDs of more than $100,000 and money market instruments are both considered 
M2 money supply measures. 
 
48. C: With regards to the stages of an economic business cycle, the expansion stage would be 
characterized by a rise in real estate prices and an increase in gross domestic product (GDP). A 
decline in the amount and rate of savings and a rise in inventories would be characteristics of the 
contraction stage. 
 
49. B: The government, in moving to slow down the economy, would reduce spending and increase 
taxes so as to reduce overall demand for goods and services and decrease the level of money that 
consumers have access to. 
 
50. D: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) does utilize the secondary market to transact in 
U.S. government securities. Further, the Federal Reserve selling securities acts to both reduce the 
overall money supply and slow demand. However, the Federal Reserve buying government

securities will ultimately cause interest rates to decrease due to the resulting increase in the money 
available to lend. 
 
51. A: Technical analysis does not consider a company’s fundamentals in its attempt to predict price 
performance. Instead, a technical analyst will examine chart patterns of past price performance in 
order to predict the direction and magnitude of future price performance. 
 
52. D: The results of a common stock ratio calculation will provide insight into a corporation’s 
capital structure. An acid test, working capital, or quick assets calculation will help in determining a 
corporation’s liquidity position. 
 
53. C: A cyclical company is sensitive to the current state of the overall economy and reflects 
whatever that may be during periods of both high and low performance. A company in a defensive 
industry is the least sensitive to the state of the overall economy. A company in a growth industry 
will see faster growth than whatever the current state of the overall economy is. 
 
54. A: A securities issuance would result in an increase in a corporation’s cash by the amount 
gained in the offering, net other costs. Paying off bond principles in cash, buying equipment with 
cash, and a dividend payout would all result in a reduction in a corporation’s cash position. 
 
55. C: A corporation’s dividend payout ratio can be determined using both the balance sheet and the 
income statement. Using only the balance sheet, one could calculate an acid-test ratio, a common 
stock ratio, and the corporation’s working capital amount. 
 
56. B: Chart patterns recognized and utilized by technical analysts in charting price performance 
are resistance, upward trend lines, and consolidation. 
 
57. D: Shareholders’ equity is made up of additional paid in surplus, retained earnings, and capital 
stock at par. 
 
58. C: The earnings category on the income statement that provides the source for paying out 
dividends to shareholders is net income after taxes. 
 
59. B: The cash assets ratio will provide a corporation’s liquidity position. The debt-to-equity ratio 
and bond ratio will both provide insight into a corporation’s capital structure. 
 
60. A: Utilizing information from a company’s balance sheet and income statement, the price-
earnings ratio, debt service ratio, and earnings per share primary can be calculated. The debt-to-
equity ratio can be calculated using only information from the balance sheet. 
 
61. D: A pharmaceutical company would be categorized as defensive, providing products that are 
needed and will be purchased by individuals regardless of the state of the economy. Manufacturing 
and automobile companies would be cyclical, and a computer company would be growth. 
 
62. C: A primarily horizontal chart pattern with buyers and sellers establishing pricing at similar 
levels is called consolidation. A resistance pattern is established after price appreciation occurs, 
causing ample sellers and supply, which then prevent further price increases. A reversal pattern 
occurs when the price of a stock has a drastic change in direction and activity. A support pattern is 
established as a result of price depreciation bringing additional interest, buyers, and demand, 
which then prevent further price decreases.

63. B: Accounts payable that are owed to a corporation’s vendors are considered to be current 
liabilities, not long-term liabilities. They must be paid within 12 months. Notes, mortgages, and 
bonds are all long-term liabilities and are due to be paid by the corporation after 12 months. 
 
64. D: The income statement would list a corporation’s net income after taxes, operating income, 
and earnings available in common. 
 
65. B: Earnings per share are the amount of a corporation’s earnings owed to its common 
shareholders as divided by each of the outstanding common shares. Earnings per share fully diluted 
are a corporation’s earnings attributed to each individual share after the conversion of any 
convertible securities. Earnings available in common are the amount of earnings available to 
common shareholders after taxes and the payout of any preferred dividend. 
 
66. D: A not-held order gives discretion to the broker as to timing and price for the order’s 
execution. A fill-or-kill order must be executed immediately upon receipt, or it must be cancelled. 
An all-or-none order indicates that the investor would like all of the securities bought or sold in the 
transaction or none at all. A market-on-open order indicates the investor’s wish to have it executed 
right at the opening of the market or as close to it as possible. 
 
67. B: Market orders do NOT guarantee a maximum or minimum executed price and in fact do not 
guarantee any specific price at all. Market orders can either be for a buy or sell order and are 
guaranteed to be filled immediately upon being introduced to the market and at the best possible 
price available. 
 
68. A: A buy limit order allows protection to an investor by providing the chance to set a maximum 
price they are willing to pay for a security. A sell limit order allows an investor to set a minimum 
price at which he or she is willing to sell a security. A buy limit order provides price protection to 
the investor in that it guarantees he or she will not pay over a certain price for that security, but 
accordingly, it will NOT guarantee execution of that order in the event that the price level of that 
security does not reach the investor’s desired price or below. 
 
69. A: A buy 275 PPG at $21 stop order will allow this investor to pay no more than $21 per share in 
filling the short position, which has a sell price of $26 per share. A profit will still be made. 
Conversely, a buy 275 PPG at $32 stop order will enable their order to go as high as $32 a share 
before being executed, thus potentially eliminating a profit being made by this investor on the short 
position.  
 
70. B: The investor’s order will be to buy 250 PPG 62.15 GTC DNR. The buy order remains exactly 
the same due to the investor stipulating the order to be do not reduce (DNR), and accordingly, the 
order will not be reduced to reflect the distribution of dividends. 
 
71. B: A specialist cannot accept market orders in that the nature of those types of orders dictates 
that they be executed as soon as they are presented to the market, and accordingly, there would be 
at that point no order to leave with the specialist. 
 
72. C: When orders come in at the same price, they are filled based on priority (first in, first 
executed), precedence (the larger of the orders is executed first), and parity (if all orders are the 
same, outstanding orders and shares are divided and shared).

73. D: In order for a floor broker to execute cross orders for the same stock at the same time, the 
specialist for that stock first must allow it, the floor broker must announce the orders, and the sell 
order must be presented at a price higher than the current best bid on that stock. 
 
74. C: Under Rule 203, a broker dealer cannot initiate an equity short sale transaction unless he or 
she has already borrowed the security, he or she has arranged to borrow the security, or he or she 
reasonably believes he or she can borrow the security. 
 
75. A: Daily Order Audit Trail Systems (OATS) reports are for both single and multiple orders. OATS 
track the trail of a trade from its beginning to end, daily OATS reports must be submitted to the 
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and reports are required the same day as receipt 
of the order or as soon as the firm receives the necessary information. 
 
76. B: Rule 80B goes into effect following the S&P 500 dropping by 7, 13, or 20 percent within a day 
of trading. 
 
77. A: Once quotes are published over the NASDAQ workstation, they must be honored. They are 
considered to be firm quotes, and a dealer refusing to honor his or her firm quotes is committing a 
violation known as backing away. 
 
78. D: In justifying a dealer’s higher-than-customary 5 percent commission, he or she would point 
to transactions that involve stocks due to the higher risk versus bonds and those trades that involve 
higher-than-usual execution expenses. Further, the dealer, being a full-service firm, may also be 
justification for the higher commission charge. 
 
79. A: Security arbitrage involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of both a stock and a security 
that may be converted into that same underlying stock. Buying shares in a company that is being 
taken over or acquired, while shorting shares in the company about to acquire them, is risk 
arbitrage. Simultaneously buying and selling the same security in two different markets in order to 
exploit the price difference between the two is market arbitrage. 
 
80. C: The trade communicated by the display of PPG 43s77.77 would be 4,300 shares of PPG traded 
at 77, immediately followed by a second trade of 100 shares of PPG traded at 77. 
 
81. B: The NASDAQ is a negotiated market where security prices are negotiated directly between 
broker dealers. Communications between the dealers may be via phone, and any negotiated terms 
regarding a given security are kept between the two negotiating parties only. Last, NASDAQ stands 
for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System. 
 
82. D: Actions falling under the role of a dealer include participating in trades by trading in and out 
of his or her own account, such as using securities in the account to fill a buy order or buying 
securities for the account to fill a customer’s sell order. Further, making a market in a security is 
also an action performed by a dealer. Conversely, a broker simply facilitates order execution for a 
customer, while not participating in the transaction, and charges a commission for their services. 
 
83. C: The pink sheets is an electronic marketplace that acts to provide quotes for securities that are 
either not listed on NASDAQ or those that have been delisted from it. Yellow sheets is a publication 
generated daily that provides corporate bond quotes. The blue list is a publication generated daily 
that provides offerings involving municipal bonds.

84. A: Once adjusted for the 3:2 stock split, the investor’s new order would be buying 330 PPG 44 
GTC. 
 
85. B: The NASDAQ opening cross is the source for the NASDAQ official opening price (NOOP) and 
allows only order changes that are more aggressive in type, such as increasing the size of the order. 
It begins at 9:28 a.m., not 9:15 a.m., and does NOT allow for order cancellations of any kind. 
 
86. D: The automated confirmation system (ACT)/trade reporting facility (TRF) provides reporting 
for trades and includes NASDAQ convertible bonds, third-market trades, and non-NASDAQ over-
the-counter (OTC) securities. 
 
87. A: The consolidated tape would display the trade as 45s.PPG32.77. 
 
88. B: 
                    
 
                                           
 
                                                                      
 
89. D: A short sale transaction involves first the sale of a stock and, second, a buy transaction 
intended to fulfill the initial sell transaction. The motivating belief in initiating this position is that 
the stock price will depreciate, offering the short seller the opportunity to purchase the stock at a 
lower price than sold in the short sale. The risk in this position is unlimited in that the price of the 
stock has the unlimited potential to rise beyond the sale price received. 
 
90. C: The Super Display Book (SDBK) system provides for an order to skip past the floor broker 
and be delivered directly to the specialist for execution, automatically matches up all preopening 
orders to be executed that can be, and provides for an electronic confirmation if executed 
immediately upon receipt. All listed securities may be traded over the system. 
 
91. A: In order for a stock to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the approval of 
both the company’s board of directors and the board’s audit committee are necessary. Additionally, 
delisting requires notification of the company's 35 largest shareholders. Listing requires a 
minimum of 400 shareholders each owning at least 100 shares and a minimum of 1.1 million 
publicly held shares. 
 
92. C: 
                     
 
                                
 
                                               
 
When a dealer fills an order on a principal basis, it is considered a riskless principal transaction. He 
or she does not own the shares in inventory and therefore must go out and buy them only then to 
turn around and sell them in order to fill the customer’s buy order. Given that, the 5 percent 
markup charged to the customer for this order will be based on the dealer’s actual cost per share, 
not the current market bid price per share.

93. C: The Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) system reports the transactions of 
fixed-income securities that are eligible for reporting. Securities that are exempt include municipal 
debt, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Securities & 
Exchange Commission (SEC)-registered corporate debt transactions, domestic and foreign, must be 
reported through the TRACE system. 
 
94. B: The exchange names that match X, P, C, and Q are Philadelphia, Pacific, Cincinnati, and 
NASDAQ. 
 
95. D: The highest level of service for a NASDAQ subscription is level III. NASDAQ TotalView is a 
quotation service covering all securities traded over NASDAQ. Level II is provided to order-entry 
firms and enables them to view the quotes associated with all market makers and allows for order 
execution. Level I offers the lowest level of service and provides quotes for registered 
representatives. 
 
96. D: Convertible bonds usually pay a lower interest rate versus nonconvertible bonds due to the 
convertible feature of the bond. The lower rate of interest benefits the corporate issuer of the bond 
in reducing the interest expense he or she pays over the life of the bond. Share appreciation could 
result in capital appreciation in the bond price for the bondholder and further appreciation upon 
conversion of the bond to common stock. Finally, the bondholder holds a senior position as a 
creditor of the corporation. 
 
97. A: Pass-throughs provide investors with interest and principal payment income relative to their 
initial investments in pools of mortgages. The payments flow through to them on a monthly basis as 
the individual mortgages in the pools are paid down. A Separate Trading of Registered Interest and 
Principal of Securities (STRIP) is an investment that provides the opportunity to purchase 
separately either the principal or interest payment cash flow stream of a Treasury security. 
Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are similar to pass-throughs except that they are 
separated into different maturity schedules, or tranches, each being paid in full one at a time. 
Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) are securities whose interest payments and principal 
amounts are influenced by the level and movement of inflation. 
 
98. C: A member bank borrowing money directly from the Federal Reserve Bank would be charged 
the discount rate on the borrowed funds. The prime rate is the rate banks charge their corporate 
customers with the best credit. The broker call loan rate is the rate that broker dealers are charged 
by banks to finance margin purchases made by their customers. The federal funds rate is charged 
by member banks to each other for overnight loans. 
 
99. B: Treasury bonds are quoted as a percentage of par and, accordingly, in terms of 32nds of 1 
percent. Here, 97.08 translates to 97 8/32 percent. 
 
                      
 
 
 
                       
 
100. D: All of the above are types of corporate money market instruments. Federal fund loans are 
made between banks, short term in length, and for $1 million or more. Reverse repurchase 
agreements involve an institutional investor selling securities to a dealer with the intention of 
repurchasing them back at a later date. Bankers’ acceptances are like postdated checks, to provide 
payment to whomever brings them to the issuing bank for processing on the stated due dates.

101. A: 
                                   
                     
 
                                                    
 
            
 
                                 
 
                  
                   
 
102. B: Commercial paper is issued at a discount to face value. It is issued in two ways, direct paper 
and dealer paper. In the former, the sale is made without the use of a dealer, and in the latter, the 
paper is sold to dealers who then resell it to investors. The interest rate for commercial paper is 
actually lower than what a commercial bank would charge, and the maturities range from 1 to 270 
days. 
 
103. C: Treasury notes have terms ranging from 1 to 10 years, pay semiannual interest, and are 
obtained through a Treasury auction held every four weeks. Treasury bonds have maturities 
ranging from 10 to 30 years. Treasury bills have maturities ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, do not pay 
semiannual interest, and are obtained through a weekly Treasury auction. 
 
104. D: In the determination of property value in relation to assessments and general obligation 
bonds, a property's value will not be its market value, but instead, its assessed value will be 
determined using the local assessment rate. 
 
          
 
                         
 
105. D: Corporate bondholders are considered to be creditors of the company, not owners. They 
only possess voting rights in the event the company fails in its ability to deliver timely interest and 
principal payments to them and take priority over preferred and common stockholders when owed 
funds that result from a company liquidation. 
 
106. B: A bond’s yield is not directly influenced or determined by the concept of supply and 
demand. It is influenced by the type of collateral on the bond, the bond’s term, and the issuer’s 
credit quality. 
 
107. D: The amount loaned to an issuer by an investor, which in most cases is $1,000, can be 
described as the principal amount, par value, or face value of the bond. 
 
108. C: Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) securities are backed by the full faith 
and credit of the U.S. government. Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) is a public for-
profit corporation in the business of purchasing mortgages and then bundling them to create 
mortgage-backed securities. Federal Farm Credit System (FFCS) is made up of privately owned 

- 110 -

lenders who sell securities that are backed by their own obligations. Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation (FHLMC) is a publicly traded company that purchases residential mortgages and 
bundles them into pools in order to then sell off interest in them to investors. 
 
109. A: Income bonds are considered to be unsecured bonds in that interest will only be paid to the 
investor if the corporate issuer has the income to do it. Mortgage bonds, equipment trust 
certificates, and collateral trust certificates are considered to be secured bonds in that they are all 
backed by a specific type of asset as collateral. 
 
110. C: The investment purchase price of bonds and their yields demonstrate an inverse 
relationship in that, as prices rise, yields fall. Therefore, a higher than par price will not indicate an 
expected higher yield than what is the stated coupon rate. A bond purchased at a premium 
indicates a purchase price paid that is above par and, consequently, an expected investment yield 
that will be less than the bond’s coupon rate. 
 
111. A: The types of short-term notes that a municipality or state may issue include bond 
anticipation notes (BANs), tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs), and revenue anticipation 
notes (RANs). 
 
112. D: Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS) are 
zero coupon bonds offering the option to an investor to purchase separately (not bundled) the 
principal or interest portions of the securities’ cash flow streams. They range in denominations of 
$1,000 to $1 million. 
 
113. B: State-issued general obligation (GO) bonds are backed by both income taxes and sales tax. 
Those issued by local governments are backed by property taxes. 
 
114. A: Series HH bonds mature in 10 years and come in denominations of $500 to $10,000. They 
do pay semiannual interest (Series EE bonds do not), can only be obtained by trading in matured 
Series EE bonds, and cannot be purchased for cash. 
 
115. B: Bond certificates, when issued, are not required to have the bond’s state of issuance. They 
are required to have the call feature, paying agent, and dates of interest payments. 
 
116. D: Book entry bonds are not evidenced by an actual physical certificate and instead have as 
proof of ownership the trade confirmation from the purchase transaction. Principal-only 
registration bonds are evidenced by an actual bond certificate printed with the owner’s name. Fully 
registered bonds are recorded for interest and principal payments with the owner's name. Bearer 
bonds are issued with a bond certificate that does not have the owner’s name printed on it. 
 
117. B: A bond’s yield to maturity is largely a combination of considering its annual income and the 
difference in price paid above, at, or below par. A bond purchased at the highest premium will 
produce the lowest yield to maturity, here being the bond purchased at 103. All the purchases 
represented here had the same coupon rates (and accordingly, the same annual income) with one 
purchased at 98 (a discount), 100 (at par), and two at a premium, 100 1/4 and 103. The par value 
received at maturity for the 103 bond will represent the largest loss to the investor of these 
purchases, given that he or she paid the most over par for that bond.

118. A: Given that corporate bonds are priced as a percentage of their par value of $1,000, the 
following calculation would provide a dollar price quote of $935 for this bond. 
                     
 
 
 
                      
 
119. B: The type of maturity represented by this example is a term maturity in that the entire issued 
amount of $850,000 becomes due in its entirety on one date set in advance. A balloon maturity 
involves the principal amount being paid over years with the largest coming due on the last date. A 
serial maturity bond also matures over years with the largest portions due in the later years. 
 
120. D: Classification of options is by series, type, and class. The series classification provides that 
options of the same class with the same expiration month and exercise price be grouped together. 
There are two types of options, calls and puts. Calls provide the buyer the option to purchase a 
stock for a specific price and only for a specific period of time. Puts provide the buyer the option to 
sell a stock for a specific price and only for a specific time period. The option class provides groups 
according to the type of option and underlying stock. 
 
121. C: The price of a corporate bond is determined by many different factors that include the 
bond’s call features if any, its issuer, interest rates, and the term of the bond. 
 
122. A: First, it’s necessary to establish what this investor’s breakeven price is. This is done by 
taking into account any money that he or she has obtained to this point as a result of this position, 
the per share price for selling short the shares of PTR, and the premium on the sale of the put. 
                 
 
The breakeven here is $44.50. This is the price at which this investor will neither gain nor lose on 
this position. 
 
Next, in order to calculate the total maximum gain, it’s necessary to take the breakeven price and 
subtract the share price he or she will receive as a result of the put being exercised. 
                 
 
This is the most he or she can profit, given the amounts taken in for selling shares short and 
receiving put premium minus the amount he or she will pay out to cover the exercised put option. 
The total maximum gain is:                 
 
123. B: Requirements for a Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) account include that there be one 
minor, one custodian, and an account title stating it’s a UGMA account and the state of origin for the 
account. Further, the assets within the account would not be registered currently in the child’s 
name as the nominal owner but, instead, registered in the custodian’s name with the child named as 
the beneficial owner. 
 
124. D: Types of account ownership include partnership, trust, and joint. 
 
125. B: The order book official actually is employed by the exchange and has the job of maintaining 
a fair and orderly market. An option market maker is an exchange member, a two-dollar broker is 
an independent member of the exchange, and a commission house broker is employed by an 
exchange member organization.

126. C: In a discretionary account, a registered representative cannot choose to close out an account 
without the client’s approval, but can choose whether to buy or sell, choose the amount to buy or 
sell, and choose the type of asset to buy or sell. 
 
127. D: Interest rate options can be either price based or rate based and used to profit from interest 
rate movements or as a hedge for Treasury securities. 
 
128. A: The managing party of a fiduciary account may not work the account and assets in it to 
benefit itself, should always act according to the prudent man rule, and may have full discretion 
with the authority to buy and sell securities and withdraw cash and securities. They may also have 
a limited power of attorney giving them the authority to buy and sell securities without the ability 
to withdraw securities. 
 
129. A: When opening an account for a customer, a registered representative should obtain from 
that customer whether he or she is an employee of a bank, citizenship status, an estimation of 
annual income, and a bank reference. 
 
130. D: Examples of a fiduciary include an administrator, a guardian, and an executor. 
 
131. B: Trust accounts can be revocable, irrevocable, complex, or simple (not basic). 
 
132. C: LEAPS stands for Long-term Equity Anticipation Securities. 
 
133. D: An investor looking to profit from foreign currency options would buy foreign currency calls 
or sell foreign currency puts, given indications that a country’s stock market is experiencing levels 
of price increase, not decrease; indications that a country is experiencing an economic upswing, not 
downturn; and indications that a country is experiencing a period of government stability, not 
instability. 
 
134. A: It is the principal of the firm who must take additional responsibility in monitoring these 
accounts over time, closely and more often than usual. A registered representative’s discretionary 
authority is not transferable, requires a limited power of attorney that can last up to three years, 
and ends with the termination of his or her employment with the firm. 
 
135. C: The Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) requires that each account have only one custodian 
and one minor. A custodian may oversee more than one separate account, and minors can have 
more than one separate account themselves. As applied to this example here, the father and mother 
each may be sole custodians of separate accounts for each of their three children A, B, and C. 
 
136. B: The credited amount is a result of subtracting the call strike price paid by the investor, as 
they exercised their option contract, from the current index quote.

The net profit from this position comes from subtracting the premium he or she paid for the call 
from the amount credited to the account. 
 
                          
 
                   
 
137. A: Registered representatives are not required to obtain or keep current information 
regarding their customers’ educational statuses or backgrounds. They do need to maintain current 
information regarding their customers’ marital statuses and investment objectives, goals, and 
philosophies. 
 
138. C: Buying and selling two options at the same time of the same class but with either different 
exercise prices, months, or both, is called a spread. Buying a call and a put at the same time with the 
same stock, strike price, and expiration is called a long straddle. Selling a call and put at the same 
time with the same stock, strike price, and expiration is called a short straddle. Buying or selling at 
the same time a call and a put with the same stock and expiration but with different strike prices is 
called a combination. 
 
139. D: A family limited partnership is most often utilized for personal estate planning as a vehicle 
for parents to transfer ownership of assets to their children and is preferred due to potential tax 
benefits that favor the parents versus other options.  
 
140. B:  
            
 
          
 
                        
 
The calculated premium to be paid to buy this call would be $2,280. 
 
141. A: There is an inverse relationship between interest rates and the prices of Treasury securities. 
As rates move in one direction, prices move in the opposite. An investor with the opinion that rates 
will fall will want to utilize price-based options to profit from that movement. Rates falling signals a 
rise in Treasury prices. This investor will want to purchase call options to buy low in anticipation of 
impending higher future prices. Additionally, he or she will want to sell put options in the hopes 
that the option will expire without being exercised and that he or she is able to profit from the 
premium income received from the sale of the option. 
 
142. C: Securities that have the brokerage firm as the registered nominal owner and the customer 
as the beneficial owner are considered held in street name. Transfer and ship securities and 
transfer and held-in-safekeeping securities are both registered in the customer’s name. 
 
143. B: A principal of the firm must accept and sign off on the new account either prior to or soon 
after the execution of the first trade. 
 
144. C: The father’s action as fiduciary that is outside of the fiduciary guidelines and not allowed is 
the naming of the child’s mother with equal discretionary authority over the account. The custodian 
does not have the authority to transfer or share discretionary authority of the account with a third 
party.

145. D: Foreign currency option rules dictate that same side position limits are 600,000 contracts, 
not 500,000; NASDAQ options trading is 9:30 a.m. (not 9:00 a.m.) to 4:00 p.m. Eastern standard 
time (EST); and option expiration is on the Saturday following the third Friday, not first, at 11:59 
p.m. EST. 
 
146. C: An investor who believes shares of PPG will rise is said to be bullish for PPG. With that, they 
will want to purchase an option contract that will allow him or her to maximize profits. Purchasing 
1 PPG August 66 call will allow him or her to make the most potential profit in the event the share 
price rises above its current $65 per share. The 66 call will maximize profits above the 72 call 
whether the stock price rises above $72 or not. Either put contract would not be appropriate, given 
the investor anticipates the share price rising. Any increase in PPG's share price above its current 
$65 will negate the investor wanting to purchase the option to sell at 52 or 64. 
 
147. B: The breakeven takes into account the investor’s original purchase price and the premium he 
or she was paid for selling the call. Here: 
 
                 
 
Selling their shares of PPG at $30.25 will allow them to neither gain nor lose on this position. A sale 
for any price above $30.25 will produce a gain. 
 
The maximum gain for the position takes into account both the breakeven for the investor and the 
strike price for the call if exercised. Here: 
 
                 
 
                       
 
If the buyer of the call exercises his or her option to buy 100 shares of PPG at $38 per share, the 
seller of that call will achieve the maximum gain above the original purchase price (having taken 
into account the premium he or she received for selling the call). 
 
148. D: Account statements are sent to the address noted on the customer’s account. Duplicate 
confirmations can be sent to someone with power of attorney, but that request must be made in 
writing. Brokerage firms may hold a customer’s account correspondence for up to two months (not 
one), if he or she is traveling domestically, and up to three months (not two), if he or she is traveling 
internationally. 
 
149. C: An investor would not utilize index options to hedge a short portfolio by buying puts or 
selling calls. He or she would, however, hedge a short portfolio by buying calls or selling puts and 
hedge a long portfolio by buying puts or selling calls. 
 
150. A: 
                     
 
Given a strike price of 60 on this put, the interest rate is 6 percent. Rates falling to 5 percent 
indicate that the investor who purchased this put is in the money 10 points at expiration.

Accordingly, this investor's account will be credited $1,000. 
 
                          
 
This investor paid a premium of $300 for this put option. The total profit will be as follows: 
 
                                            
 
151. B: A fiduciary account requires that anyone but the beneficial owner of an account intending to 
enter orders for that account must provide confirmation of the authority to do so in writing. 
 
152. C: The Options Clearing Corporation publishes a disclosure document called the 
Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options, provides a guarantee as to an option’s 
performance, and facilitates standardized options to settle on a trade date plus one. They do not, 
however, issue option contracts on the trade date but instead the day after the trade date. 
 
153. A: The investor’s option contract dictates that he or she paid a $200 contract premium for an 
option to buy 100 shares of PPG at $55 per share with the expiration of that contract being in May. 
The option premium must be multiplied by 100, and each contract is for one round lot of 100 
shares of the contracted stock. 
 
154. B: Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) guidelines regarding contributions include gifts being 
irrevocable, discretionary authority for account assets to be used for the minor’s education, and a 
limitless gift size. Additionally, the tax-free gift limit is set at $14,000 per year, not $16,000 per year. 
 
155. C: An option seller is the writer of the contract and his or her goal is primarily not to have the 
option contract exercised but instead to profit off of the premium income resulting from writing the 
contract itself. Further, the seller does not have the right to decline having the contract exercised. 
The seller, by writing the contract, does not retain rights to decline exercising the contract but 
assumes the role instead of having the obligation to the buyer to either sell (call) or buy (put) if the 
buyer of the option should choose to exercise his or her option. 
 
156. A: A joint tenants in common (JTIC) account requires that, once deceased, that party’s assets 
from the account become the property of the estate and do not go to the surviving party of the 
account. In a transfer on death (TOD) account, the parties are provided the opportunity to 
designate in advance who they would like their portion of the account to go to in the event they die. 
In a joint tenants with rights of survivorship (JTWROS) account, the death of one party of the 
account provides for the surviving party to retain all assets in the account. A joint account requires 
that all parties of the account be alive. 
 
157. B: This position, selling a call and a put with the same stock, strike price, and expiration, is a 
short straddle. A long straddle is the same with the exception of being a purchase of a call and put. A 
combination is like a straddle except it’s a purchase or sale of a call and put with same stock and 
expiration but different expirations. A spread is buying and selling two options at the same time of 
the same class but with either different exercise prices, months, or both. 
 
158. C: In opening a corporate account, a registered representative may, if necessary, obtain a 
corporate charter and the corporation’s bylaws that confirm his or her ability to buy securities on 
margin, a corporate resolution that stipulates individuals with authority to enter orders, and a 
certificate of incumbency stipulating the officers who can do business on behalf of the corporation.

159. A: A calendar spread consists of a long and short option with same class but different 
expirations: 
Sell 1 PPG May 23 put 
Buy 1 PPG August 23 put 
 
A price spread consists of a long and short option with the same class but different strike prices: 
Buy 1 PPG May 23 put 
Sell 1 PPG May 21 put 
 
A diagonal spread consists of a long and short option with the same class but different strike prices 
and expirations: 
Sell 1 PPG May 21 put 
Buy 1 PPG August 23 put 
 
160. D: An investor who is long a stock ideally would like to achieve some downside price 
protection against loss given the possibility of the share price falling in general, and then 
specifically, below the original purchase price. There are two options for them doing that here. 
 
By purchasing a put he or she is essentially purchasing the option to sell the shares of DZE at a set 
price that will allow profit taking, given the original purchase price. Even if the DZE share price 
drops, the investor will retain the option to sell the shares at the put strike price until the expiration 
of the contract. 
 
By selling a call, he or she is essentially selling to another investor the option to buy the DZE shares 
at a set price that will allow profit taking, given the original purchase price. The investor will profit 
from the option being exercised by the buyer of the call due to the fact that the strike price of the 
call will have been set at a price above the investor’s original purchase price, thereby protecting 
him or her from any loss in the event of a DZE share price drop. By selling the call, the investor 
retains the opportunity to sell the shares at a profit. 
 
161. D: The maximum gain on this bear call spread would be the net result of the premium he or 
she gained on selling the call and the amount paid when buying the call. 
 
         
 
             
 
This $300 total maximum gain will be attained if neither option is exercised and they both expire. 
 
162. B: A bearish outlook points to the opinion that stock prices will fall. In relation to an options 
contract, it points to the opinion that the stock that is the subject of the contract has a future 
outlook of price decline. Given this, contract sellers would pursue writing call contracts so as to 
hopefully avoid the buyer exercising a contract to buy higher a stock whose price is in decline and 
profit from the premium gained by simply writing the contract. Option contract buyers would 
pursue purchasing put contracts so as to exercise an option to sell high a stock whose price is 
currently in decline. Conversely, option contract buyers would not pursue purchasing call contracts. 
There would be no need to purchase the option to buy high a stock in an open-end decline.

163. A: An option’s premium is an extension of what its value is to the market and potential 
investors. The determination of the premium paid by an investor purchasing the option will be 
based on factors such as interest rates, supply and demand, and the timing of the option’s 
expiration. It will not be based on the option’s class and series. 
 
164. C: Considering all of this investor’s option positions, two of the four are currently in the money. 
These options would maximize both his or her investment and profit if exercised now. 
 
HKP August 75 put 
 
Shares of HKP are currently quoted at $72.50 per share. If exercised, this contract would provide 
the investor with the option of selling 100 shares of HKP at $75 per share when the quoted current 
market price is below that. To go further, the investor’s profit is higher selling the shares via the 
option contract than selling them in the current open market. 
 
RPT August 81 call 
 
Shares of RPT are currently quoted at $82.75 per share. If exercised, this contract would provide 
the investor with the option of buying 100 shares of RPT at $81 per share when the quoted current 
market price is higher than that. To go further, the investor’s profit is higher buying shares of RPT 
via the option contract than buying them in the current open market. 
 
165. D: 
                                   
 
           
 
The breakeven amount is the where the gain and loss of the transaction equalizes so as to come out 
no better and no worse for having participated in the transaction. Here, that amount is $78 per 
share. 
 
                          
 
The maximum loss is the most that this investor stands to lose for having purchased this option 
contract. If the share price for PPG drops to below the strike price of $73 and remains there up 
through the contract’s expiration date, the investor will not exercise the option, and the most he or 
she will be out is the premium paid for the contract, here $500. 
 
The maximum gain for this investor is unlimited given that the option contract provides them with 
the option to buy shares at $73 per share. Every dollar of increase in share price above the 
breakeven price will provide a gain to the investor. With this, the potential for gain is unlimited. 
 
166. B: This investor would have a call that is in the money given that the current stock price is 
greater than the option’s strike price. The call provides them with the option to purchase PPG at 
$33 per share. With it currently trading at $36.50, he or she could exercise the option, purchase the 
shares at $33, and benefit from the price appreciation between the two.

167. B: With regards to transacting in a new margin account, investors are required to deposit 
either $2,000 in equity or half of the purchase price of the securities, whichever is greater: 
 
Minimum equity required:  
$2,000 
 
Half of the securities’ purchase price: 
 
               
                   
 
In this example, the required deposit would be $1,000. The minimum equity requirement of $2,000 
is greater than half of the purchase price of the securities, which is $500. Even with that, a 
customer’s required deposit will never be more than the purchase price of the securities. Here, 
$2,000 is greater than the purchase price of $1,000; therefore, the purchase price of $1,000 will be 
the required deposit. 
 
168. A: The statement regarding his educational background would be considered a 
misrepresentation and grounds for discipline. In order for it to qualify as a misrepresentation and 
cause for discipline, it must have been untrue and knowingly communicated to the customer. Here, 
this representative knowingly lied and mischaracterized his education with the intent to impress 
this prospective customer. The statement regarding the biotech analyst would not qualify as a 
misrepresentation given that, at the time, the representative made the statement that the analyst 
was employed by his firm. The representative cannot be held responsible for the analyst leaving 
even though that is largely the reason the customer signed with him and opened a brokerage 
account with the firm. 
 
169. B: Government bonds are the type of investment that this representative should recommend 
given this investor’s primary objective of generating income. Annuities and collateralized mortgage 
obligations (CMOs) are investments more appropriate to an investor seeking liquidity. Common 
stocks are more suitable for an investor with capital appreciation as his or her primary investment 
objective. 
 
170. B: 
                
             
                    
 
                 
                  
 
171. C: Municipal bonds would be the choice for an investor seeking investments with tax benefits. 
Direct participation programs and annuities are appropriate with investors primarily seeking 
liquidity. Corporate bonds are great for investors seeking income. 
 
172. A: In order to provide good and complete delivery, certificates must be delivered in round lots 
that can be easily combined to form 100. Here, that is three certificates of 100 shares each, with one 
certificate for 20 shares. Six certificates of 50 shares each does not provide a complete delivery, and 
30 certificates of 10 shares each with four certificates of five shares each does not qualify as good 
round lots.

173. D: Intangible drilling costs are 100 percent deductible for the year in which they occur and 
include wages, well casings, and geological surveys. 
 
174. C: This individual should ensure that the certificate of limited partnership he or she files 
includes specifics regarding how to approve and incorporate new limited partners into the 
partnership, specifics regarding how the partnership will be dissolved, if necessary, and details of 
the business that the partnership will be engaging in. It will not be necessary to include the 
educational and professional backgrounds of all partners, limited and general. 
 
175. D: Good delivery states that a customer must satisfy a few requirements, which include 
confirming that all attachments are there as well as a uniform delivery ticket included and that the 
signatures of all owners are present and all owners are actually living. 
 
176. A: Regarding a new client that may qualify for institutional customer status, this 
representative should consider whether the client can independently determine potential 
investments for him- or herself and also make decisions based on his or her independent 
evaluations. Further, if the client meets the suitability criteria to make his or her own investment 
decisions, then this representative has the authority to recommend almost any investment and 
leave it to the client to determine whether he or she should proceed. This representative, however, 
should begin by ensuring that this client has at least $10 million (not $15 million) in assets in order 
to qualify as having institutional customer status. 
 
177. C: This representative, in entering a market order that was influenced by information from a 
report that had not been made public yet, would be guilty of trading ahead. Front running involves 
entering a firm order before entering a customer’s much larger order with the intent to profit from 
the market effect of that customer’s large order. Capping is done with the intent to prevent the 
further rise of a stock price. Painting the tape is practiced by two or more individuals and involves 
them creating the false appearance of activity in a given security only in an effort to attract new 
buyers to that security. 
 
178. A: Guidelines regarding gifts being exchanged between employees of member firms include the 
recipient’s employer approving it first and the gift being given first to the employer to then pass 
along to the employee. Gifts of this type have restrictions, but are definitely not prohibited, and in 
fact, have a set limit of $100 or less (not $75), per person, per year. 
 
179. B: Proxies are a type of absentee ballot provided to those shareholders who may not be able to 
attend shareholder meetings or vote on corporate issues in person. 
 
180. A: Limited partners are limited in their risk to the loss of only what they’ve invested into the 
partnership. General partners handle the management of the partnership and, accordingly, may 
receive compensation for that management role. Additionally, general, not limited partners, have 
the authority to purchase property and sign off on legally binding contracts on behalf of the 
partnership. 
 
181. D: An investor seeking a real estate partnership with lower risk and more predictable, steady 
cash flows should choose an existing property partnership. Because this would involve an existing 
income property, the cash flows would be very predictable, established, and immediate. With new 
construction, the risk is higher, and there is no guarantee of income until the property is completed, 
rented, or sold. With government-assisted housing, risk can be lower, but due to potential changes

rehabilitation partnership provides very unpredictable cash flows in that, due to being a 
restoration, there may be no real rental history to predict from. 
 
182. C: 
                                                           
   
  
 
Using a 30-day month, the number of days total = 259 days 
January = 30 days 
February = 30 days 
March = 30 days 
April = 30 days 
May = 30 days 
June = 30 days 
July = 30 days 
August = 30 days 
September = 19 days 
(15 days as of purchase date + 4 days for up to but not including settlement) 
Saturday and Sunday are not proper settlement dates, but interest accrues on Friday (the day after 
purchase date), over Saturday and Sunday, and then ends Monday right up to settlement, which is 
Tuesday. 
 
                                       
     
                             
                     
         
 
183. D: Churning is trading practice that is prohibited by the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority’s (FINRA’s) rules of fair practice and is practiced by representatives with the motive of 
producing higher commissions for themselves. In determining whether the practice of churning has 
taken place in a given account, regulators may examine whether there is a high frequency of 
transactions and look at the representatives’ earned commissions on the accounts in question. 
Regulators will not, however, take into account the customer’s level of profitability on the account 
when deciding whether churning has taken place. 
 
184. C: The omission of an immaterial fact in relation to an investment decision by a representative 
to a customer would not be considered a violation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s 
(FINRA’s) rules of fair practice. The omission must be material in order for it to qualify as a 
violation. Violations of FINRA’s rules of fair practice do include a representative making any 
guarantee of profit in an investment to a customer and using a pending dividend as the only reason 
for recommending a specific stock to a customer. 
 
185. D: Mutual fund sales literature should utilize graphs to illustrate the fund’s performance 
against a broad-based index, not contain general statements comparing the relative safety of 
mutual funds versus other investments, and note the sources for any graphs contained therein. 
 
186. B: The Medallion Signature Guarantee Program is not free to members. They must pay a fee in 
order to transact through the program. The Medallion Program involves New York Stock Exchange 
(NYSE) members being given the authority to substitute their signatures on securities certificates

with a stamped medallion and does ensure that transfer agents accept securities transferred by 
member firms utilizing this program. 
 
187. A: This investor, by seeking to invest in an oil and gas partnership with only the lowest risk, 
should consider an income program. This type of partnership involves existing wells that will 
provide not only predictable cash flows but cash flows that would begin immediately. Existing wells 
will always run the risk of reserves running out, but that overall risk is still low relative to other oil 
and gas partnership programs. An exploratory drilling program involves drilling for new reserves. 
Although it can provide the largest payoff, the risk is also the highest due to a low rate of success in 
drilling in new fields. A developmental program has less risk than an exploratory program in that 
the drilling is being done near proven reserves, but again, it is still risky in that the success rate for 
this type of drilling is relatively low. 
 
188. D: To ensure that investment recommendations are suitable for each individual customer, 
representatives must review different types of customer information including their current debt 
loads and major expenses, their tax brackets, and their retirement plans and future needs. 
 
189. B: This representative recommending specific technology stocks for purchase or sale to this 
group of investors would be considered making blanket recommendations and, accordingly, be 
against the Federal Industry Regulatory Authority’s (FINRA’s) rules of fair practice. Even though 
they all seem to have similar profiles as investors, there may always be some way that differentiates 
them and thus makes these recommendations wrong for one or more of them. 
 
190. D: A general partner in a limited partnership has the authority to sell property on behalf of the 
partnership. They may not borrow funds from the partnership, engage in activities that compete 
directly with the partnership, or intertwine their own personal funds with those of the partnership. 
 
191. B: A sharing arrangement that would require that all of the program costs be covered by the 
limited partners and only after the limited partners have made their investment back would the 
general partners start to receive payments is called a reversionary working interest. A 
disproportionate working interest has the general partner covering a small part of the costs of the 
partnership while receiving a significant portion of the partnership’s revenue. A functional 
allocation involves both the limited and general partners sharing in the revenues of the 
partnership. An overriding royalty interest provides an individual with the opportunity to receive 
partnership royalties without having to take on any of the risks of the partnership. 
 
192. C: The margin department is responsible for determining amounts owed to or by customers as 
well as dates related to those monies. The cashiering department processes cash and securities that 
are both received and distributed. The order room directs orders once received to the appropriate 
market to be executed and further provides confirmation once executed. The purchase and sales 
department interacts in the customer’s account, inputting transactions and handling billing. 
 
193. A: Due to the termination of this limited partnership, a liquidation of the partnership assets is 
necessary. First in line regarding order of payment upon liquidation of the partnership’s assets are 
its secured lenders. Next in line would be its general creditors, followed by the limited partners and 
then the general partner. 
 
194. D: Possible reasons for this seller’s rejection of delivery could include missing attachments, 
providing no guarantee for signatures, physically damaged certificates, and delivering securities 
before the official settlement date.

195. B: This investor, in seeking a real estate partnership that will provide tax benefit as well as 
investment income, should avoid any partnerships involving raw land. This type of partnership 
provides no tax benefits or deductions to the investor. It is simply the raw land appreciation that 
the investor would be gaining. Government-assisted housing partnerships will provide tax credits, 
new construction partnerships will provide deductions on expenses and depreciation upon 
completion of the project, and historic rehabilitation partnerships provide tax credits and 
deductions. 
 
196. C: An investor looking into investing in a limited partnership and specifically seeking an 
investment that produces quick income and with tax benefits attached should first analyze a 
partnership’s time horizon and tax features. The partnership’s liquidity and management abilities 
are also important but not first and primary to meeting this investor’s objectives. 
 
197. A: Defined benefit plans may either provide the employee with a retirement payment equal to 
a fixed percentage of his or her previous salary or a lifetime of fixed payments. Additionally, with 
this type of plan, the employer’s contribution will be determined by an actuary. Because the 
employee’s contribution will be based on factors such as life expectancy, there is no maximum of 
$16,500 per year.  
 
198. C: Customer account statements must include balances, both debit and credit, and the receipt 
of dividends qualifies as account activity. If a customer’s account goes inactive, customer account 
statements must be sent at least quarterly, not semiannually. Additionally, account statements must 
be sent only for months when the account has been active, not monthly for any year when the 
account has been active. 
 
199. B: A customer in receipt of an erroneous trade report would be bound by the actual execution 
of the trade, not the trade as erroneously reported, assuming the trade itself was executed without 
error. The firm would not be bound in any way by the trade as erroneously reported. 
 
200. C: The allowable individual retirement account (IRA) investment here is the limited 
partnership. Non-allowable investments include term life insurance, real estate, and margin 
accounts. 
 
201. A: For bonds that pay interest semiannually, months for which interest will be paid on the 1st 
or the 15th include April and October, which have a span of six months between them. February 
and July, March and August, and April and September are only five months apart each. 
 
202. D: With regards to educational institutions, tax-deferred accounts may be utilized by 
employees of schools that are state supported, such as state universities, public high schools, and 
state colleges.

Using a 30-day month, the number of days total = 47 days 
January = 30 days 
February = 17 days 
(15 days as of purchase date + 2 days for up to but not including settlement) 
 
                                      
     
=                              
                     
         
 
204. C: There is no fifth business day (T + 5) settlement option. The investor may choose the 
buyer’s option and choose the payment and delivery dates for the purchased securities; a cash 
settlement that settles the same day; or next-day settlement, meaning next business day. 
 
205. A: The investment professional seeking out the department handling issues related to tender 
offers should make contact with the reorganization department. The cashiering department 
processes cash and securities that are both received and distributed. The purchase and sales 
department interacts in the customer’s account, inputting transactions and handling billing. The 
order room directs orders once received to the appropriate market to be executed and further 
provides confirmation once executed. 
 
206. B: The Internal Revenue Code 501C3 provides nonprofit status to organizations that include 
trade schools, zoos, science foundations, and parochial schools. 
 
207. D: Transaction confirmations should include, when applicable, the settlement instructions for 
the transaction, a statement regarding whether the firm involved was a market maker in that 
security, and any specifics regarding the type of option. 
 
208. A: 
                           
                                                                        
 
                                                            
                      
         
 
209. C: A 529 plan is not a type of defined contribution plan but instead is a type of college savings 
plan. Profit sharing, stock bonus plans, and 401K plans are all types of defined contribution plans. 
 
210. B: A 529 plan can be utilized as either a prepaid tuition plan for a specific school or as a college 
savings plan. Withdrawals can be made free of federal tax and also free of state tax in most states. 
Further, assets in the account remain under a donor’s control up to and beyond the student 
reaching the age of majority.

211. D: Regarding moving a pension plan from a previous employer to a plan with a new employer, 
if done by rolling over the plan, more than 20 percent of the distributed amount will initially be 
withheld, and the employee will be required to deposit 100 percent of the plan assets into a 
qualified plan within 60 calendar days. If accomplished via a direct transfer, the employee will not 
physically possess the plan assets at any time in the process. 
 
212. B: The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) provides guidelines for 
employee benefit plans. There are certain decisions that might be made by this employer regarding 
the retirement plan it provides for employees that would not be subject to ERISA’s rules. These are 
called settlor functions and include decisions to eliminate plan options, choose plan options, and 
make changes to employee-level contributions. Vesting issues, however, are regulated by the ERISA 
guidelines. 
 
213. C: A loan consent agreement provides authority to a brokerage firm to loan out a customer’s 
securities. The customer, however, is not required to sign it, and securities purchased are held in 
the name of the brokerage firm, not in the customer’s name. 
 
214. B: There are a few different types of individual retirement accounts (IRAs), which include a 
simplified employee pension (SEP), educational, and traditional accounts. A margin account is not a 
type of IRA account. 
 
215. A: Simplified employee pension IRAs (SEP IRAs) have a maximum for employer contributions 
to employees’ accounts at $51,000, and the contributions employers make into their employees’ 
SEP IRAs are tax deductible by the employer. However, in order to qualify for an SEP IRA with an 
employer, an employee must be at least 21 years old, not 18, and have earned at least $550 with 
that employer, not $1,000. Further, an employee can qualify for an employer contribution into an 
SEP IRA either by opening an account on their own behalf or having the employer open one for him 
or her. 
 
216. C: Tax-sheltered annuities are provided to employees as retirement plans. Only employees of 
nonprofit or public organizations may utilize them. These include religious organizations, nonprofit 
hospitals, and public schools. This does not include small private businesses. 
 
217. D: A special memorandum account (SMA) can be created by many circumstances, which 
include the receipt of dividends or interest into a customer’s margin account or the long market 
value of that account increasing. 
 
218. A: 
                                  
 
Regulation T 50%: $11,000 
 
Customer’s borrowed amount: $11,000 
Customer’s equity amount: $11,000

219. C: A customer with a restricted margin account can withdraw securities from the account only 
by depositing cash worth 50 percent of the value of those securities. Additionally, he or she could 
sell securities and withdraw 50 percent (not 60 percent) or less of the proceeds from that sale or 
purchase marginable securities by depositing at least 50 percent (not 40 percent) of their value. 
 
220. A: An employee who works at an unincorporated business who would like to contribute to a 
Keogh plan needs to have worked for that employer for at least one year. Additionally, he or she 
must be at least 21 years of age, not 18, and he or she needs to work at the job full time, at least 
1,000 hours per year, not 750. 
 
221. D: An investor who would like to have his or her individual retirement account (IRA) account 
moved to a new custodian would need to choose between having the account rolled over or 
transferred. Considerations should include that the frequency of a direct transfer is unlimited and 
that a transfer is executed by a simple signature on a transfer form. Further, he or she should be 
aware that a rollover can be utilized only once every 12 months. 
 
222. A: If a customer were to sell short 1,000 shares of TXS at $11 per share and the market 
experienced a price decrease to $9 per share, his or her margin account would see a decrease in its 
short market value and a the credit balance would remain the same, not increase. Additionally, the 
equity would increase, not decrease. 
 
223. C: This individual, in opening a traditional individual retirement account (IRA), will be able to 
contribute $5,500 to a separate account on behalf of his spouse, may be subject to both a penalty 
tax and income taxes if he were to make any withdrawals prior to reaching the age of 59 1/2, and 
will be able to contribute up to $6,500 in earned income to an account on his own behalf due to 
currently being over the age of 50. 
 
224. D: A customer establishing both a long and short position that would then create a combined 
account would be required to meet the minimum equity for the long and short position as well as 
satisfy the Regulation T requirement for both the long and short positions. 
 
225. B: Regulation T does not provide the Federal Reserve Board with the authority to oversee the 
frequency of credit extension to a given customer but does provide them with the authority to 
oversee the amount of deposit or margin required and the dates of payment for the transaction. 
 
226. A: Regulation S-P provides that privacy notices may be sent electronically and that customers 
may opt out of having their nonpublic, personal information shared with third-party companies. It 
further requires that the firm delivers annual, not semiannual, privacy notices to its customers and 
that the firm delivers the first privacy notice to its customers by the time the account is opened, not 
within three days of the opening of the account. 
 
227. B: 
                                                     
 
                                                                
 
                                                        
 
When the PTR share price increased from $65 to $81, both the long market value and the 
customer’s equity increased.

228. C: A brokerage firm seeking a bank loan would like to commingle two customers’ pledged 
securities as collateral. To do so, it is required by Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) rule 
15c2-1 to first obtain written permission from both of the customers. Further, the pledged 
securities of the customers may not be commingled with securities owned by the firm. 
 
229. A: A credit agreement will not provide details of an amortization schedule in that a margin 
loan does not amortize. It will describe the method for interest charges, provide the terms of 
customer credit extension, and specify interest rates to be charged for the loan. 
 
230. C: Securities that are exempt from Regulation T include nonconvertible corporate debt, 
municipal securities, U.S. government securities, and U.S. government agencies. 
 
231. D: A brokerage customer wanting to transfer his or her account to a new firm can choose to 
take any assets that are not transferable through Automated Client Account Transfer (ACAT) and 
liquidate them, physically have them shipped, or choose to have them simply retained by the old 
firm. 
 
232. C: The customer account document that, once signed, obligates a customer to provide as 
collateral for a margin loan the securities that were purchased on margin is called a hypothecation 
agreement. A credit agreement dictates the terms and conditions of the extension of credit to the 
customer. The reserve requirement is a required deposit banks make with the Federal Reserve 
Board. The customer agreement is what the customer signs upon opening an account with a 
brokerage firm and describes the terms of that relationship. 
 
233. A: Regulation T of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides the Federal Reserve Board the 
authority to control customer credit in their securities purchases as extended by brokerage firms. 
Regulation U regulates credit as provided by banks, Regulation G regulates credit as provided by 
commercial lenders, and Regulation X regulates credit as provided by foreign lenders. 
 
234. D: Non-marginable securities include initial public offerings, options, and non-NASDAQ over-
the-counter (OTC) securities. They do not include 45-day-old newly issued securities. Thirty-day-
old newly issued securities, however, are considered to be nonmarginable. 
 
235. B: A wrap account is a type of account that, for one fixed annual fee, will provide an advisory 
role for a customer as well as cover the account execution costs. A margin account provides a 
customer with the opportunity to purchase securities partially by a deposited payment and the

other portion by loan. A joint account is primarily an account whose ownership is shared by two or 
more adults. A numbered account is one that, as requested by the customer, is not identified by a 
name but instead a number or symbol. 
 
236. D: With regards to transacting in a new margin account, investors are required to deposit 
either $2,000 in equity or half of the purchase price of the securities, whichever is greater. 
 
Minimum equity required: 
$2,000 
 
Half of the securities purchase price: 
                   
                       
 
In this example, the required deposit would be $27,500. It is half of the purchase price of the 
securities and more than the $2,000 minimum equity required. 
 
237. B: 
                                             
 
                           
 
                
         
                  
 
        
           
 
238. C: The sales charge on an open-end mutual fund pays for items that include the commissions of 
representatives and their brokerage firms and the underwriter’s expenses. The sales charge is not a 
fund expense but, instead, a cost the investor must bear that covers fund distribution. Accordingly, 
the sales charge would not pay for the printing of the fund prospectus or mailing expenses. 
 
239. A: 
                                                   
              
 
 
         
  
              
 
240. D:

242. D: The Investment Company Act of 1940 designates three different types of investment 
companies: unit investment trust, management investment company, and face amount company. 
 
243. C: An investor seeking to invest only in common stock shares has the share pricing dictated by 
a formula, and is provided the opportunity to receive dividends and vote, should invest in an open-
end mutual fund. A unit investment trust will have a portfolio of primarily government or municipal 
debt, and a closed-end mutual fund would invest in common shares and debt securities as well as 
having share pricing determined by supply and demand. 
 
244. A: The test established by the Investment Company Act of 1940 is called the 75–5–10 test. The 
asset allocations required by this test are that 75 percent of the fund’s assets should come from 
other issuers, they should not invest in any one company more than 5 percent, and 10 percent is the 
maximum for owning another company’s outstanding voting stock. 
 
245. B: An investment company seeking to register with the Securities & Exchange Commission 
(SEC) must have at least 100 shareholders. Additionally, it must have a net worth of at least 
$100,000, not $150,000, and there is no requirement that states a trading minimum for the 
previous year. 
 
246. D: Investment companies are not prohibited from lending money in an effort to earn interest. 
They are prohibited from performing the activities of a bank, trying to take control of other 
companies, receiving broker commissions, and operating with 100 shareholders or less. 
 
247. C: The board of directors of a management company is not responsible for managing the 
portfolio of investments. They are responsible for hiring the custodian bank, monitoring the 
company president and others who are responsible for daily operations, and deciding the types of 
funds the company should offer. 
 
248. A:

250. B: The features here that are common to both variable annuities and mutual funds are the 
transfer agent and custodian bank. Management for a variable annuity comes from a board of 
managers, and for a mutual fund, it’s a board of directors. Taxation on gains and reinvestments for a 
variable annuity is tax deferred and, for a mutual fund, is due immediately.
