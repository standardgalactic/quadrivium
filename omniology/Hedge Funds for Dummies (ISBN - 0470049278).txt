Author’s Acknowledgments
So many wonderful people helped me with this book! I talked to many hedge
fund managers and others in the investment business, including Cliff Asness,
Catherine Cooper, Beth Cotner, Nancy Fallon-Houle, Marshall Greenwald, Steve
Gregornik, Anil Joshi of NuFact, Russ Kuhns, Alecia Licata of the CFA Institute,
Dan Orlow, Tino Sellitto, Lisa Springer, Ryan Tagal at Morningstar, Scott
Takemoto, and Gary Tilkin and Kelly Quintanilla at Global Forex Trading. I 
also talked to a handful of other hedge fund managers who asked to remain
anonymous; they know who they are, and I hope they also know how much I
appreciate their help. The CFA Society of Chicago put on a great conference
entitled “New Considerations in the Quest for Alpha”, which took place in the
middle of writing this book and gave me some valuable insights. I’m grateful to
the volunteers and presenters who made the day so productive for me.
I want to thank a few friends who helped give me direction on writing this
and who pointed me to friends of theirs who work in the hedge-fund busi-
ness. Bev Bennett, Lisa Duffy, Mary Richardson Graham, and Erik Sherman all
were wonderful help. I also need to acknowledge Jennie Phipps, the propri-
etor of Freelance Success (www.freelancesuccess.com), one of the best
resources out there for professional writers. 
As for the mechanics of putting together the book, Natalie Harris, Stacy
Kennedy, and Josh Dials of Wiley were fabulous to work with. Their patience
and good humor got me through a tough schedule. Marcia Layton-Turner gets
kudos for introducing me to her agent, Marilyn Allen, who became my agent
and made the book possible.
Thanks, everyone!

about mythical investment funds that make money no matter what hap-
pens in the market. And you want a part of that action.
I have to be upfront: Hedge funds aren’t newfangled mutual funds, and they
aren’t for everyone. They’re private partnerships that pursue high finance. If
you don’t mind a little risk, you can net some high returns for your portfolio.
However, you have to meet strict limits put in place by the Securities and
Exchange Commission — namely that you have a net worth of at least $1 million
or an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 with a spouse). Most hedge-fund
investors are institutions, like pensions, foundations, and endowments; if you
work for an institution, you definitely need to know about hedge funds. I also
have to let you in on a little secret: Not all hedge fund mangers are performing
financial alchemy. Many of the techniques they use are available to any investor
who wants to increase return relative to the amount of risk taken.
Hedge Funds For Dummies tells you what you need to know, whether you
want to research an investment in hedge funds for yourself or for a pension,
an endowment, or a foundation. I also give you information about investment
theories and practices that apply to other types of investments so you can
expand your portfolio. Even if you decide that hedge funds aren’t for you, you
can increase the return and reduce the risk in your portfolio by using some of
the same techniques that hedge fund managers use. After all, not everything
fund managers do requires a PhD in applied finance, and not everything in
the world of investing is expensive, difficult, and inaccessible.
About This Book
First, let me tell you what this book is not: It is not a textbook, and it is not a
guide for professional investors. You can find several of those books on the
market already, and they are fabulous in their own right. But they can be dry,
and they assume that readers have plenty of underlying knowledge.

This book is designed to be simple. It assumes that you don’t know much
about hedge funds, but that you’re a smart person who needs or wants to
know about them. I require no calculus or statistics prerequisite; I just give
you straightforward explanations of what you need to know to understand
how hedge funds are structured, the different investment styles that hedge
fund managers use, and how you can check out a fund before you invest.
And if you still want to read the textbooks, I list a few in the Appendix.
Conventions Used in This Book
I’ll start with the basics. I put important words that I define in italic font. I
often bold the key words of bulleted or numbered lists to bring the important
ideas to your attention. And I place all Web addresses in monofont for easy
access.
I’ve thrown some investment theory into this book. You don’t need to know
this information to invest in hedge funds, but I think it’s helpful to know what
people are thinking when they set up a portfolio. I also make an effort to
introduce you to some technical terms that will come up in the investment
world. I don’t want you to be caught short in a meeting where a fund manager
talks about generating alpha through a multifactorial arbitrage model that
includes behavioral parameters. Many hedge fund managers are MBAs or
even PhDs, and two notorious ones have Nobel Prizes. Folks in the business
really do talk this way! (To alert you to these topics, I often place them under
Technical Stuff icons; see the section “Icons Used in This Book.”)
During printing of this book, some of the Web addresses may have broken
across two lines of text. If you come across such an address, rest assured
that I haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the
break. When using a broken Web address, type in exactly what you see on the
page, pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
I include sidebars in the book that you don’t need to read in order to follow
the chapter text. With that stated, though, I do encourage you to go back and
read through the material when you have the time. Many of the sidebars con-
tain practice examples that help you get a better idea of how some of the
investment concepts work.

You can also skip the text marked with a Technical Stuff icon, but see the pre-
vious section for an explanation of why you may not want to skim over this
material.
Foolish Assumptions
The format of this masterpiece requires me to make some assumptions about
you, the reader. I assume that you’re someone who needs to know a lot about
hedge funds in a short period of time. You may be a staff member or director at
a large pension, foundation, or endowment fund, and you may need to invest in
hedge funds in order to do your job well, even if you aren’t a financial person. I
assume that you’re someone who has plenty of money to invest (whether it’s
yours or not) and who could benefit from the risk-reduction strategies that
many hedge funds use. Maybe you’ve inherited your money, earned it as an
athlete or performer, gained it when you sold a company, or otherwise came
into a nice portfolio without a strong investment background.
I also assume that you have some understanding of the basics of investing —
that you know what mutual funds and brokerage accounts are, for example. If
you don’t feel comfortable with the basic information, you should check out
Investing For Dummies or Mutual Funds For Dummies, both by Eric Tyson.
(Calculus and statistics may not be prerequisites, but that doesn’t mean I
don’t have any!)
No matter your situation or motives, my goal is to give you information so
that you can ask smart questions, do careful research, and handle your
money in order to meet your goals.
And if you don’t have a lot of money, I want you to discover plenty of informa-
tion from this book so that you’ll have it at the ready someday. For now, you
can structure your portfolio to minimize risk and maximize return with the
tools that I provide in this book. You can find more strategies than you may
know.
How This Book Is Organized
Hedge Funds For Dummies is sorted into parts so that you can find what you
need to know quickly. The following sections break down the structure of this
book.
3
Introduction

Part I: What Is a Hedge Fund, Anyway?
The first part describes what hedge funds are, explains how managers struc-
ture them, and gives you a little history on their development. It also covers
the nuts and bolts of SEC regulation and the process of buying into a hedge
fund. Go here for the basics.
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge 
Funds Are Right for You
In this part, I cover many investment considerations — including your time
horizon, your liquidity needs, taxes, and other special needs you may have —
in order to help you figure out if you should be in a hedge fund. If you decide
against it, the information here may give you some ideas on other ways you
can invest your money. All investors face a list of goals for their money as
well as a series of constraints that they must meet. The art of investing is bal-
ancing your investment objectives with constraints so that your money
works the way you need it to.
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge 
Fund Investment Strategy
Part III is the fun part — an overview of the many different ways that a hedge
fund manager can generate a big return while keeping investment risk under
control. Fund managers can buy and sell, take big risks, or rely on arbitrage;
become shareholder activists or trade anonymously; or speculate on interest
rates, currencies, or pork bellies.
This part also covers ways you can evaluate a hedge fund’s risk-adjusted per-
formance. You’ve probably heard of a handful of headline-grabbing hedge-
fund scams, and you can find plenty of investors who have learned the hard
way just how much risk their hedge funds had.
Part IV: Special Considerations 
Regarding Hedge Funds
Part IV covers some additional information that you need to know, including
alternatives to hedge funds for smaller investors. It also tells you how to get
4
Hedge Funds For Dummies

help with your investment and how to check out the background of the fund
and fund manager before you invest. My goal is to help you do the right thing
with your money, and this section helps you make the decisions that will
achieve this goal.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this For Dummies-only part, you get to enjoy some top 10 lists. I present 
10 reasons to invest in hedge funds, 10 reasons to avoid them, and 10 myths
about the hedge-fund business. I also include an Appendix full of references
so that you can get more information if you desire.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see five icons scattered around the margins of the text. Each icon
points to information you should know or may find interesting about hedge
funds. They go as follows:
This icon notes something you should keep in mind about hedge-fund invest-
ing. It may refer to something I’ve already covered in the book, or it may high-
light something you need to know for future investing decisions.
Tip information tells you how to invest a little better, a little smarter, a little
more efficiently. The information can help you ask better questions of your
hedge fund manager or make smarter moves with your money.
I’ve included nothing in this book that can cause death or bodily harm, as far
as I can figure out, but plenty of things in the world of hedge funds can cause
you to make expensive mistakes. These points help you avoid big problems.
I put the boring (but sometimes helpful) academic stuff here. I even throw in
a few equations. By reading this material, you get the detailed information
behind the investment theories, some interesting trivia, or some background
information.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
Well, open up the book and get going! Allow me to give you some ideas. You
may want to start with Chapter 1 if you know nothing about hedge funds so
you can get a good sense of what I’m talking about. If you need to set up your
investment objectives, look at Chapters 7, 8, and 9. If you want to know what
hedge fund managers are doing with your money, turn to Chapters 10 through
13. And if you’re about to buy into a hedge fund, go straight to Chapter 18 so
that you can start your due diligence.
If you aren’t a big enough investor for hedge funds but hope to be some day,
start with Chapters 5, 6, and 9 to discover more about structuring portfolios.
Chapter 16 can help you meet your investment objectives as a small investor.

s a hedge fund a surefire way to expand your wealth or a scam that will
surely rip you off? Is it a newfangled mutual fund or a scheme for raiding
corporations and ripping off hard-working employees? You see hedge funds
in the news all the time, but it’s hard to know exactly what they are. That’s
because, at its essence, a hedge fund is a bit of a mystery. A hedge fund is a
lightly regulated investment partnership that invests in a range of securities
in an attempt to increase expected return while reducing risk. And that can
mean just about anything.
Some of the smartest money managers on Wall Street have started their own
hedge funds, attracted by the freedom to manage money as they see fit while
raking in good money for themselves and their investors in the process.
Hedge fund managers today take on the roles of risk managers, investment
bankers, venture capitalists, and currency speculators, and they affect dis-
cussions in boardrooms at brokerage firms, corporations, and central banks
all over the world.

In this chapter, I cover the basic vocabulary and structure of hedge funds.
Having this knowledge helps you understand hedge funds so that you can
figure out what you need to know in order to make the best decisions with
your money. Also, I clarify what a hedge fund is and what it isn’t, which is
important because you come across a lot of myth and misinformation out
there. The information you find here serves as a springboard for the topics I
introduce throughout the rest of the book, so get ready to dive in.
Defining Hedge Funds (Or Should 
I Say Explaining Hedge Funds?)
Here’s the first thing you should know about hedge funds: They have no clear
identity or definition. In the investment world, “I run a hedge fund” has the
same meaning as “I’m a consultant” in the rest of the business world. The
speaker may be managing money and making millions, or she may want a
socially acceptable reason for not having a real job. The person who really
manages money may go about her business in any number of ways, from
highly conservative investing to wildly aggressive risk taking. She may be
beating the market handily, or she may be barely squeaking by.
I’m not trying to say that the term “hedge fund” means nothing. Here’s the
short answer: A hedge fund is a lightly regulated investment partnership that
uses a range of investment techniques and invests in a wide array of assets 
to generate a higher return for a given level of risk than what’s expected of
normal investments. In many cases, but hardly all, hedge funds are managed
to generate a consistent level of return, regardless of what the market does.
Before I get to the longer, more complicated explanation of hedge funds, how-
ever, it helps to know exactly what hedging is.
Hedging: The heart of the 
hedge-fund matter
Hedging means reducing risk, which is what many hedge funds are designed
to do. Maybe you’ve hedged a risky bet with a friend before by making a con-
servative bet on the side. But a hedge fund manager doesn’t reduce risk by
investing in conservative assets. Although risk is usually a function of return
(the higher the risk, the higher the return), a hedge fund manager has ways
to reduce risk without cutting into investment income. She can look for ways
to get rid of some risks while taking on others with an expected good return,
10
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

often by using sophisticated techniques. For example, a fund manager can
take stock-market risk out of the fund’s portfolio by selling stock index
futures (see Chapter 5). Or she can increase her return from a relatively low-
risk investment by borrowing money, known as leveraging (see Chapter 11). If
you’re interested in investing in hedge funds, you need to know how the fund
managers are making money.
Risk remains, no matter the hedge-fund strategy, however. Some hedge funds
generate extraordinary returns for their investors, but some don’t. In 2005,
the Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index — a leading measure of hedge-
fund performance (www.hedgeindex.com/hedgeindex/en/default.
aspx) — reported that the average hedge-fund return for the year was 7.61
percent. The NASDAQ Composite Index (www.nasdaq.com) returned only
1.37 percent for the same period, but the Morgan Stanley Capital International
World Index (www.mscibarra.com) was up 10.02 percent. The amount of
potential return makes hedge funds more than worthwhile in the minds of
many accredited and qualified investors (see Chapter 2 for more on hedge-
fund requirements).
In 2005, 9,000 hedge funds managed a total of $1 trillion dollars, according 
to Hedge Fund Research, a firm that tracks the hedge-fund industry (www.
hedgefundresearch.com). In 2005, therefore, the average fund had $111
million in assets. Given the industry’s standard fee structure, in which man-
agers charge at least 1 or 2 percent of assets (see Chapter 2), the typical fund
generated $1.1 to $2.2 million on the year for the fund manager.
Return is a function of risk. The challenge for the hedge fund manager is to
eliminate some risk while gaining return on investments — not a simple task,
which is why hedge fund managers get paid handsomely if they succeed. (For
more on risk and return, check out Chapter 6.)
Identifying hedge funds: 
The long explanation
Okay, I’ll go ahead and start covering the gory details of hedge funds. A hedge
fund is a private partnership that operates with little to no SEC regulation
(see Chapter 3). A hedge fund differs from so-called “real money” — traditional
investment accounts like mutual funds, pensions, and endowments — because
it has more freedom to pursue different investment strategies. In some cases,
these unique strategies can lead to huge gains while the traditional market
measures languish. The following sections dig deeper into the characteristics
of hedge funds, as well as the bonuses that come with funds and the possibil-
ity of bias in the reported performances of funds.
11
Chapter 1: What People Talk About When They Talk About Hedge Funds

Little to no regulatory oversight
Hedge funds don’t have to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). The funds and their managers also aren’t required to 
register with the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) or the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the major self-regulatory bodies in
the investment business. However, many funds register with these bodies
anyway, choosing to give investors peace of mind and many protections 
otherwise not afforded to them (not including protection from losing 
money, of course). Whether registered or not, hedge funds can’t commit
fraud, engage in insider trading, or otherwise violate the laws of the land.
In order to stay free of the yoke of strict regulation, hedge funds agree 
to accept money only from accredited or qualified investors. Accredited
investors are individuals with a net worth of at least $1 million or an annual
income of $200,000 ($300,000 for a married couple; see Chapter 2 for more
information). Qualified investors are individuals, trust accounts, or institu-
tional funds with at least $5 million in investable assets.
The reason for the high-net-worth requirement is that regulators believe people
with plenty of money generally understand investment risks and returns better
than the average person, and accredited investors can afford to lose money if
their investments don’t work out. In order to avoid the appearance of improper
marketing to unqualified investors, hedge funds tend to stay away from Web
sites, and some don’t even have listed telephone numbers. You have to prove
your accredited status before you can see offering documents from a fund or
find out more about a fund’s investment style.
Aggressive investment strategies
In order to post a higher return for a given level of risk than otherwise
expected (see Chapter 6, which covers risk calculation in much detail), a
hedge fund manager has to do things differently than a traditional money
manager. This fact is where a hedge fund’s relative lack of regulatory over-
sight becomes important: A hedge fund manager has a broad array of invest-
ment techniques at his disposal that aren’t feasible for a tightly regulated
investor.
Here are a few investment techniques that I cover in great detail in this book:
 Short-selling (Chapter 11): Hedge fund managers buy securities that
they think will go up in price. If they spot securities that are likely to go
down in price, they borrow them from investors who own them and then
sell the securities in an attempt to buy them back at lower prices in
order to repay the loans.
12
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

 Leverage (Chapter 11): Hedge funds borrow plenty of money in order to
increase return — a technique that can also increase risk. The fund has
to repay the loan, regardless of how the investment works out.
The use of leverage is a key difference between hedge funds and other
types of investments. Most hedge funds rely on leverage to increase
their returns relative to the amount of money that they have in their
accounts. Because of the risk that comes with the strategy, funds often
use leverage only for low-risk investment strategies in order to increase
return without taking on undue risk.
 The Buffet Line: Okay, so I made this one up. But hedge fund managers
do have a wide range of investment options. They don’t have to lock in
to stocks and bonds only. They buy and sell securities from around the
world, invest in private deals, trade commodities, and speculate in
derivatives. They have flexibility that traditional asset managers only
dream about. (See Chapters 10 through 13 for more information on the
many options.)
Manager bonuses for performance
Another factor that distinguishes a hedge fund from a mutual fund, individual
account, or other type of investment portfolio is the fund manager’s compen-
sation. Many hedge funds are structured under the so-called 2 and 20 arrange-
ment, meaning that the fund manager receives an annual fee equal to 2 percent
of the assets in the fund and an additional bonus equal to 20 percent of the
year’s profits.
The performance fee is a key factor that separates hedge funds from other
types of investments. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations
forbid mutual funds, for example, from charging performance fees. You may
find that the percentages differ from the 2 and 20 formula when you start
investigating prospective funds, but the management fee plus bonus struc-
ture rarely changes.
The hedge fund manager receives a bonus only if the fund makes money.
Many investors love that the fund manager’s fortunes are tied to theirs. The
downside of this rule? After all the investors pay their fees, the hedge fund’s
great performance relative to other investments may disappear. For informa-
tion on fees and their effects on performance, see Chapters 2 and 4.
Biased performance data
What gets investors excited about hedge funds is that the funds seem to have
fabulous performances at every turn, no matter what the market does. But
the great numbers you see in the papers can be misleading.
13
Chapter 1: What People Talk About When They Talk About Hedge Funds

Hedge funds are private investment partnerships with little to no regulatory
oversight, which means that fund managers don’t have to report performance
numbers to anyone other than their fund investors. Many hedge fund man-
agers report their numbers to different analytical, consulting, and index firms,
but they don’t have to. Naturally, the funds most likely to participate in out-
side performance measurement are the ones most likely to have good perfor-
mance numbers to report — especially if the fund managers are looking to
raise more money.
On the other end of the success spectrum, many hedge funds close shop
when things aren’t going well. If a fund manager is disappointed about losing
his performance bonus (see Chapter 2), he may just shut down the fund,
return all his investors’ money, and move on to another fund or another pro-
ject. Hedge Fund Research, a consulting firm that tracks the industry (www.
hedgefundresearch.com), estimates that 11.4 percent of hedge funds
closed in 2005. After a fund shuts down, it doesn’t report its data anymore (if
it ever did); poorly performing funds are most likely to close, which means
that measures of hedge-fund performance have a bias toward good numbers.
You have to do your homework when buying into a hedge fund. You can’t rely
on a rating service, and you can’t rely on the SEC, as you can with a mutual
fund or other registered investment. You have to ask a lot of tough questions
about who the fund manager is, what he plans for the fund’s strategy, and
who will be verifying the performance numbers. (Chapter 18 covers this
process, called due diligence, in more detail.)
Pledging the secret society: Getting 
hedge fund information
Some hedge funds are very secretive, and for good reason: If other players in
the market know how a fund is making its money, they’ll try to use the same
techniques, and the unique opportunity for the front-running hedge fund may
disappear. Hedge funds aren’t required to report their performance, disclose
their holdings, or take questions from shareholders.
However, that doesn’t mean hedge fund managers refuse to tell you anything.
A fund must prepare a partnership agreement or offering memorandum for
prospective investors that explains the following:
 The fund’s investment style
 The fund’s structure
 The fund manager’s background
14
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

A hedge fund should also undergo an annual audit of holdings and perfor-
mance and give this report to all fund investors. (The fund manager may
require you to sign a nondisclosure agreement as a condition of receiving the
information, but the information should be made available nonetheless.) But
the hedge fund manager doesn’t have to give you regular and detailed infor-
mation, nor should you expect to receive it. (See Chapter 8 for more on trans-
parency issues.)
Beware the hedge fund that gives investors no information or that refuses to
agree to an annual audit — that’s a blueprint for fraud. See Chapter 18 for
more information on doing your due diligence.
Surveying the History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds haven’t been around forever, but they aren’t exactly new, either.
Their fortunes have varied with those of the markets, and their structures
have evolved with the development of modern financial-management theo-
ries and techniques.
Knowing the history of hedge funds will give you a sense of how the modern
hedge fund market came to be. You’ll understand how some of the myths 
of funds originated and why some of the practices (like fee structure and
secrecy) developed over time. And, the history is interesting. Isn’t that
reason enough? In this section, I cover some of the highlights and lowlights
that have come since the development of the first hedge fund in 1949.
Alfred Winslow Jones and 
the first hedge fund
Alfred Winslow Jones wrote a book in 1941 that examined the attitudes of 
residents of Akron, Ohio toward large corporations. The book, Life, Liberty,
and Property: A Story of Conflict and a Measurement of Conflicting Rights, is 
still in print by the University of Akron Press. When it came out, the magazine
Fortune reprinted sections of the book, and Jones eventually joined the maga-
zine’s editorial staff. While at Fortune, he learned quite a bit about investing,
and in 1949, he quit the magazine to form a money-managing firm, A.W. Jones
& Co., which is still in business in New York.
At Fortune, Jones covered some of the developing theories in modern finance —
especially the notion that markets were inherently unpredictable. He was determined
to find a way to remove the risk from the market, and the way he found was to buy the
15
Chapter 1: What People Talk About When They Talk About Hedge Funds

shares of stocks expected to go up while selling short the stocks expected to go
down. With this strategy, he could remove much of the risk of the market, and his
fund would have steady performance year in and year out. I describe this style of
investing, sometimes called long-short investing, in Chapter 11. And in a twist of
fate, Fortune first used the term “hedge fund” to describe Jones’ fund in a 1966
article.
Alfred Winslow Jones had two other innovations for the modern hedge fund,
both of which have overshadowed his investment style:
 His analysis of the Investment Company Act of 1940: In the analysis, he
stated that a private-partnership structure can remain unregistered as
long as its investors are accredited.
 His fee. He charged his investors 20 percent of the fund’s profits. More
than 50 years later, few hedge fund managers still hedge the way that
Jones did, but almost every manager copies his partnership structure
and fee schedule.
1966 to 1972: Moving from 
hedging to speculating
After Alfred Winslow Jones developed a nice business collecting 20 percent of
the profits from his partners by using his hedging strategy, other money man-
agers wondered if they could also set up private partnerships and charge 20
percent while following different investment strategies. The answer? Yes. The
name “hedge fund” stuck, but the emerging funds were more speculative than
hedged. Hedging is the process of reducing risk. Speculating is the process 
of seeking a high return by taking on a greater-than-average amount of risk.
Although hedging and speculating are opposing strategies, many hedge funds
today use both.
The change in strategy took place partly because the stock market was really
strong, so short-selling proved to be a losing game (see Chapter 11). Also,
because the stock market was so strong, money managers could make a lot 
of money by borrowing and buying stock.
And then, in 1972, the bottom dropped out. A stock-market bubble that
formed at the end of the 1960s finally and totally burst, leaving hedge fund
managers with big losses. Some managers who had borrowed heavily (or
leveraged; see Chapter 11) found themselves insolvent. Most of the newly
formed hedge funds shut their doors, and the aggressive style of investing 
fell out of favor for about a decade.
16
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

George Soros, Julian Robertson, 
and hedge-fund infamy
George Soros, who co-founded the Quantum Fund with Jim Rogers, and Julian
Robertson, who founded the Tiger Fund, are two legendary names in the
hedge-fund business. They both formed their funds in the late 1960s to early
1970s go-go era, managed to hold on through the market collapse that took
place in 1972, and then started posting spectacular profits in the 1980s.
Both funds followed a macro strategy, which means they looked to profit
from big changes in the global macroeconomy (see Chapter 13). They took
bets on changes in interest rates, exchange rates, economic development,
and commodities prices. They also used options and futures (see Chapter 5)
to improve their returns and manage their risks. (In 1988, George Soros pub-
lished a book about his unconventional approach to investing, The Alchemy
of Finance [Wiley].)
Both fund managers achieved icon status of sorts in the 1990s, and then both
managers ran into trouble. Soros made huge profits by betting (and investing
accordingly) that the currencies of several Asian countries were overvalued.
He was right, but the resulting collapse of the currencies led to political unrest
in Indonesia and Malaysia and turned Soros into a pariah. Julian Robertson
believed that the huge increases in technology stocks were overdone in the
1990s, and he was proven right in 2000, but his performance suffered terribly
until then. (Chapter 13 dives into these stories more deeply.)
The rise and fall of Long-Term 
Capital Management
One infamous hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, had spectacular
performance year after year until it nearly caused a global financial meltdown
in 1998. The history of this firm tells a tale of just how little hedging takes
place at some of the biggest and best-performing hedge funds.
The 1960s and 1970s brought about huge changes in the way that people
thought about finance and investing. Experts developed several new acade-
mic theories (you can read about them in Chapters 6 and 14). Some acade-
mics realized that they could earn more by managing money than they could
by teaching students how to do it, so they quit their university jobs and
started hedge funds.
17
Chapter 1: What People Talk About When They Talk About Hedge Funds

In 1994, John Meriwether, an experienced bond trader at Solomon Brothers,
joined with other traders and two professors, Robert Merton and Myron
Scholes, to form a fund. The fund’s managers took advantage of relatively
small differences in the prices of different bonds. Most of their trades were
simple and low-risk, but they used a huge amount of borrowed money (known
as leverage) to turn their simple trades into unusually large returns. In 1997,
Merton and Scholes shared the Nobel Prize in Economics, giving their fund a
highly academic aura. People thought the fund was filled with investors who
had discovered an unusually low-risk way of generating unusually large returns.
In the summer of 1998, the Russian government defaulted on its bonds, which
caused investors to panic and trade their European and Japanese bonds for
U.S. government bonds. Long-Term Capital Management bet that the small
differences in price between the U.S. bonds and the overseas bonds would
disappear; instead, the concern over Russia’s problems led to large differ-
ences in price that steadily widened. The mistake made it difficult for Long-
Term Capital Management’s managers to repay the large amounts of money
that the fund had borrowed, which put pressure on the investors who had
given the loans. The Federal Reserve Bank then organized a restructuring
plan with the banks that Long-Term Capital Management dealt with in order
to prevent a massive financial catastrophe. In total, Long-Term Capital
Management lost $4.6 billion dollars.
The Yale Endowment: Paying institutional
attention to hedge funds
The Yale University Endowment, which operates in the financial and trade
press, has $15.2 billion under management as of press time, making it the
second-largest college endowment in the world. Its success has driven most
of the institutional interest in hedge funds, and institutional interest has cre-
ated all the demand in the market. The performance of the Yale Endowment
is considered a milestone.
It has long kept 25 percent of its assets in hedge funds, and in this avenue, 
it performs the best out of all the major university endowments. The fund’s
manager, David Swensen, earned a doctorate in finance at Yale and worked on
Wall Street before joining Yale’s staff in 1985. Once on board, he decided to
diversify the university’s money into holdings other than stocks and bonds,
adding investments in private equity, oil, timberland, and hedge funds.
Management members at other endowments and foundations have long
looked at Yale’s performance with green-eyed envy. They’ve witnessed one of
the richest colleges get richer, in part due to hedge-fund investing, and they
18
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

want to do the same. By 2005, the National Association of College and University
Business Officers reported that 8.7 percent of all college-endowment money was
invested in hedge funds, up from 1.8 percent in 1996. And, in 2005, 21.7 percent
of the money in endowments larger than $1 billion was invested in hedge funds.
Generating Alpha
Hedge fund managers all talk about alpha. Their goal is to generate alpha,
because alpha is what makes them special. But what the heck is it? Unfor-
tunately, alpha is one of those things that everyone in the business talks
about but no one really explains.
Alpha is a term in the Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory (MPT), which I
explain in Chapter 6. The theory is a way of explaining how an investment
generates its return. The equation used to describe the theory contains 
four terms:
 The risk-free rate of return
 The premium over the risk-free rate that you get for investing in the
market
 Beta
 Alpha
Beta is the sensitivity of an investment to the market, and alpha is the return
over and above the market rate that results from the manager’s skill or other
factors. If a hedge fund hedges out all its market risk, its return comes
entirely from alpha.
People aren’t always thinking of the Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory
when they use alpha. Instead, many people use it as shorthand for whatever
a fund does that’s special. In basic terms, alpha is the value that the hedge
fund manager adds.
In theory, alpha doesn’t exist, and if it does exist, it’s as likely to be negative
(where the fund manager’s lack of skill hurts the fund’s return) as positive. In
practice, some people can generate returns over and above what’s expected
by the risk that they take, but it isn’t that common, and it isn’t easy to do.

Chapter 1: What People Talk About When They Talk About Hedge Funds

Introducing Basic Types of Hedge Funds
Despite the ambiguities involved in describing hedge funds, which I outline in
detail at the beginning of this chapter, you can sort them into two basic cate-
gories: absolute-return funds and directional funds. I look at the differences
between the two in the following sections.
Because hedge funds are small, private partnerships, I can’t recommend any
funds or fund families to you. And because hedge fund managers can use a
wide range of strategies to meet their risk and return goals (see the chapters
of Part III), I can’t tell you that any one strategy will be appropriate for any
one type of investment. That’s the downside of being a sophisticated, accred-
ited investor: You have to do a lot of work on your own!
Absolute-return funds
Sometimes called a “non-directional fund,” an absolute-return fund is designed
to generate a steady return no matter what the market is doing. Alfred Winslow
Jones managed his pioneering hedge fund with this goal, although the long-
short strategy (see Chapter 11) that he used was just one of several methods
that snagged him consistent returns (see the section “Alfred Winslow Jones
and the first hedge fund”).
Although absolute-return funds are close to the true spirit of the original
hedge fund, some consultants and fund managers prefer to stick with the 
label absolute-return fund rather than “hedge fund.” The thought is that hedge
funds are too wild and aggressive, and absolute-return funds are designed to
be slow and steady. In truth, the label is just a matter of personal preference.
An absolute-return strategy is most appropriate for a conservative investor
who wants low risk and is willing to give up some return in exchange. (See
Chapter 9 for more information on structuring your portfolio.) Hedge fund
managers can use many different investment tools within an absolute-return
strategy, a few of which I present in Part III of this book.
Some say that absolute-return funds generate a bond-like return, because like
bonds, absolute-return funds have relatively steady but relatively low returns.
The return target on an absolute-return fund is usually higher than the long-
term rate of return on bonds, though. A typical absolute-return fund target is
8 percent to 10 percent, which is above the long-term rate of return on bonds
and below the long-term rate of return on stock.
20
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

Directional funds
Directional funds are hedge funds that don’t hedge — at least not fully (see
the section “Hedging: The heart of the hedge-fund matter” for more on hedg-
ing). Managers of directional funds maintain some exposure to the market,
but they try to get higher-than-expected returns for the amount of risk that
they take. Because directional funds maintain some exposure to the stock
market, they’re said to have a stock-like return. A fund’s returns may not be
steady from year to year, but they’re likely to be higher over the long run
than the returns on an absolute-return fund.
Directional funds are the glamorous funds that grab headlines for posting
double or triple returns compared to those of the stock market. The fund
managers may not do much hedging, but they have the numbers that get
potential investors excited about hedge funds.
A directional strategy is most appropriate for aggressive investors willing to
take some risk in exchange for potentially higher returns. (See Chapter 9 for
more information on structuring your portfolio.)
Meeting the People in Your 
Hedge Fund Neighborhood
Many different people work for, with, and around hedge funds. The following
sections give you a little who’s who so you understand the roles of the people
you may come into contact with and of people who play a large role in your
hedge fund.
Managers: Hedging for you
The person who organizes the hedge fund and oversees its investment
process is the fund manager — often called the portfolio manager or even PM
for short. The fund manager may make all the investment decisions, handling
all the trades and research himself, or he may opt to oversee a staff of people
who give him advice. (See Chapter 2 for more information on hedge fund
managers.) A fund manager who relies on other people to work his magic
usually has two important types of employees:
21
Chapter 1: What People Talk About When They Talk About Hedge Funds

 Traders: The traders are the people who execute the buy-and-sell deci-
sions. They sit in front of computer screens, connected to other traders
all over the world, and they punch in commands and yell in the phones.
Traders need to act quickly as news events happen. They have to be
alert to the information that comes across their screens, because they’re
the people who make things happen with the fund.
 Analysts: Traders operate in real time, seeing what’s happening in the
market and reacting to all occurrences; analysts take a longer view of
the world. They crunch the numbers that companies and governments
report, ask the necessary questions, and make projections about the
future value of securities.
Lawyers: Following the rules
Although hedge funds face little to no regulation, they have to follow a lot of
rules in order to maintain that status. Hedge funds need lawyers to help them
navigate the regulation exemptions and other compliance responsibilities
they face (see Chapter 3), and hedge fund investors need lawyers to ensure
that the partnership agreements are in order (see Chapter 2) and to assist
with due diligence (see Chapter 18).
Consultants: Studying funds 
and advising investors
Because big dollars are involved, many hedge fund investors work closely
with outside consultants to advise them on their investment decisions.
Hedge fund managers also work with consultants — both to find accredited
investors through marketing and to make sure that they’re meeting their
investors’ needs. (For more information on working with a consultant, see
Chapter 17.)
A consultant can take a fee from an investor or from a hedge fund, but not
from both. That way, the consultant stays clear of any conflicts of interest.
Advising investors
A key role for consultants is helping investors make sound investment deci-
sions. Staff members who oversee large institutional accounts — like pen-
sions, foundations, or endowments — rely heavily on outside advisors to
ensure that they act appropriately, because these types of accounts hinge on
22
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

the best interests of those who benefit from the money. (See Chapters 8 and
10 for more on this responsibility.)
Consultants not only ensure that investors follow the law, but also advise
investors on the proper structure of their portfolios in order to help them
meet their investment objectives. A consultant analyzes how the investor
divides the money among stocks, bonds, and other assets and then recom-
mends alternative allocations that may result in less risk, higher return, or
both (see Chapter 9 for more on asset allocation).
Monitoring performance
Investment consultants track the performance of their clients, of course, but
they also build relationships with hedge fund managers and collect data on
the risk, return, and investment styles of different funds and fund managers.
They use the information they collect to advise their clients on investment
alternatives. Because you can find only a few central repositories for hedge-
fund performance information, and because hedge funds don’t have to make
their return data public, this is an important service. (See Chapter 14 for
more info on evaluating performance.)
Marketing fund managers
Many hedge funds are small organizations. In some cases, the fund managers
work alone. These funds have a small number of investors, and they may not
allow their investors to take money out for a year or two, so they don’t need
to do constant marketing. It rarely makes sense for a hedge fund to have a
dedicated marketing person on staff.
But that doesn’t mean hedge funds don’t need to find other investors. When
the fund is new or when current investors want to withdraw their money,
marketing becomes important. To help find new investors, many hedge funds
work with consultants, who bring together investors looking for suitable
hedge funds and hedge funds looking for suitable investors.
Paying Fees in a Hedge Fund
Hedge funds are expensive, for a variety of reasons. If a fund manager figures
out a way to get an increased return for a given level of risk, he deserves to be
paid for the value he creates. And, one reason hedge funds have become so
popular is that money managers want to keep the money that they earn instead
of getting bonuses only after they meet big corporate overhead. Face it — a
good trader would rather keep his gains than share them with an overpaid CEO
23
Chapter 1: What People Talk About When They Talk About Hedge Funds

who doesn’t know a teenie from a tick. (Chapters 2 and 4 contain more informa-
tion on paying fees, but here I cover the basics.)
A teenie is 1⁄16 of a dollar. A tick is a price change. If the next trade takes a secu-
rity up in price, it’s an uptick; if it takes the security down, it’s a downtick. In the
olden days, when everything traded in eighths or teenies, ticks were printed on
strips of paper called ticker tape. If a person did something notable, like win a
World Series or land on the moon, he or she would receive a parade, and every-
one at the brokerage firms would open their windows and throw out their used
ticker tape (hence, ticker-tape parade).
Almost all hedge fund managers receive two types of fees: management fees
and performance fees. More than anything else, this business model, not the
investment style, distinguishes hedge funds from other types of investments.
Managing management fees
A management fee is a fee that the fund manager receives each year for run-
ning the money in the fund. Usually set at 1 percent to 2 percent of assets in a
fund, the management fee covers certain operating expenses, salaries for the
fund manager and staff, and other costs of doing business. The fund pays
other expenses in addition to the management fee, such as trading commis-
sions and interest.
For example, say a hedge fund has $100,000,000 in assets. It charges a 
2-percent management fee, which is $2,000,000. The fund has an additional
$1,750,000 in trading expenses and interest. The fund investors have to pay
fees from the assets whether the fund makes money or bombs.
If the fund’s management fee is too low, the fund manager won’t be able to
run the business effectively or hire the necessary staff. If the fee is too high,
the fund manager will make such a nice living that he or she will have little
incentive to pursue a performance bonus.
Shelling out your percentage 
of performance fees
Most hedge funds take a percentage of the profits as a performance fee — also
called the incentive fee or sometimes the carry. The industry standard is 20
percent, although some funds take a bigger cut and some take less. You need
to read the offering documents you receive from a fund to find out what the
fund charges and whether the fund’s potential performance justifies the fee.
24
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

If the fund loses money, the fund manager gets no performance fee. In most
funds, the fund managers can’t collect performance fees after losing years
until the funds’ assets return to their previous high levels, sometimes called
the high-water marks. You can find a detailed explanation of how these fees
work in Chapter 2.
The performance fee means that the fund manager’s incentives are closely
aligned with those of the fund’s investors. As folks on Wall Street say, hedge
fund managers eat what they kill. The big problem with the performance fee
is that if a fund has a negative year, the fund manager has an incentive to
close the fund and start over instead of losing the performance fee. And
every fund will have a bad year once in a while.
In many cases, a hedge fund’s outstanding performance disappears after the
performance fee hits the manager’s pocket. You may find that you’re paying a
lot of money and dealing with many complications to be in a hedge fund when
you could get the same net return through a different type of investment, like
a mutual fund.

Funds Are Structured

 Committing to a fund
 Keeping in contact with the fund manager
 Exploring alternatives to hedge funds
You may have heard that a hedge fund is just a mutual fund with better
performance, but hedge funds have some characteristics that make
them very different from other investment vehicles. For instance, hedge
funds don’t necessarily have better performance than mutual funds, but they
do have higher fees. In this chapter, I cover some of the fine points about the
structure of hedge funds that you need to know before you make any commit-
ments. For example, in order to give hedge fund managers the flexibility to
pursue aggressive and offbeat investment strategies, the funds themselves
have a rigid approach to their investors. Purchase and sale restrictions tend
to be high, and the fees associated with the funds tend to be great.
And even if you decide that hedge funds aren’t right for you after you read
this book, you can still benefit from some of the strategies used in other
investment vehicles such as mutual funds and pooled accounts. I cover
mutual funds that have some hedge-fund characteristics in Chapters 15 and
16; I cover other accounts, which, like hedge funds, are for wealthy investors
but that have some big differences, in this chapter.

Exploring the Uneven Relationships
between Fund Partners
Most hedge funds are structured as lightly regulated (if at all) investment
partnerships (see Chapter 1 for more on this definition), but that doesn’t
mean that the partners within a fund are equal. Some partners stand on
higher ground than others, and the structure of the fund affects the liability
that investors may take on. If you’re not familiar with hedge-fund partner-
ships, read on to find out more. If you buy into a hedge fund, you enter into a
partnership, and you need to know what rights and obligations you have —
especially if something goes wrong.
General partners: Controlling the fund
A hedge fund’s general partners are the founders and money managers of the
fund. These people have the following responsibilities:
 Form the fund
 Control the fund’s investment strategy
 Collect the fees charged
 Pay the bills
 Distribute the bonuses
In exchange for their control, general partners take on unlimited liability in
the fund, which means that their personal assets are at stake if the fund’s lia-
bilities exceed its assets. Many general partners own their stakes through S
corporations or other structures that shield their personal assets.
Under the Internal Revenue code, an S corporation is an ownership structure
for small businesses that under U.S. tax code provides owners with limited
liability, meaning that their personal assets are unlikely to be called upon to
settle any corporate liabilities. (It isn’t the perfect protection, by the way, and
a good lawyer can explain all the nuances to you.) An S corporation pays no
income tax because all gains and losses of the corporation pass through to
the individual shareholders in proportion to their holdings. The shareholders
claim the gains and losses on their personal income taxes.
When the general partners launch the fund, they put up the seed money for
operations. They rent office space, buy the fund’s computers, and hire an
administrative staff. The partners have to do much of this work before a
28
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

single dollar enters the fund or any asset-management fee hits their bank
accounts. It’s possible to set up a hedge fund for as little as $10,000, depend-
ing on how much work the fund manager does and how much the lawyers
who advise her charge.
A fund’s original general partners may grant the general-partner status to cer-
tain key hires or give it as a reward to top-performing employees. Some firms
give the partnership in lieu of bonuses, and at other firms, managers expect
new partners to write checks to cover their shares of the partnership stake.
When general partners leave a fund, the other general partners buy out their
stakes. The money for the buyout may come from different sources:
 From the new investments of any new partners
 From the firm’s own account
 From a note given to the former partner, which the fund pays off over
time
Limited partners: Investing in the fund
The limited partners (often shortened to limiteds) of a hedge fund are the
people who invest in the fund — yep, I’m talking about you. When investors
give their money to the fund manager (a general partner) to invest, they take
a stake in the fund as a business. Limited partners can come in many differ-
ent flavors:
 Individual investors, pension funds, or endowments
 Brokerage firms or investment companies that are sponsoring the fund’s
general partners
 Other partnerships or corporations formed to make investments in
hedge funds (as with a fund of funds; see Chapter 15 for more informa-
tion on funds of funds)
Limited partnership has its drawbacks. Limited partners pay fees to the gen-
eral partners for their management services (see the section “Fee, Fi, Fo, Cha
Ching! Paying the Fees Associated with Hedge Funds” later in the chapter).
They have little or no say in the fund’s operations. And the fund may restrict
ongoing communication with the general partners to only a few times per
year. But, in exchange for these limitations of control, limited partners have
limited liability. You can lose only the amount you invest in the fund and no
more. If the hedge fund goes belly-up and a landlord comes looking for back
29
Chapter 2: Examining How Hedge Funds Are Structured

rent, he can go after the general partners and their personal assets, but he
can’t come to the limited partners and ask them for money.
Only Accredited or Qualified 
Investors Need Apply
Much like going to college, watching romantic comedies, or following
NASCAR, hedge funds aren’t for everyone. If you don’t meet the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission’s definition of an accredited investor
(see Chapter 3 for more on the SEC), you can’t invest in a hedge fund. And
some hedge funds go beyond the SEC requirements, making sure that all
investors are qualified purchasers. Hedge funds are risky investment funds
that may use unusual strategies or buy exotic assets, and they have to
answer to very little regulatory oversight. As the joke goes, when doctors
make mistakes, at least they kill their patients. When hedge fund managers
make mistakes, they ruin their clients.
In the following sections, I help you identify your investment status and give
you some reasons for the SEC requirements. I also present some options
available to you if you don’t meet the requirements.
Which kind of investor are you?
Federal securities laws provide a great deal of oversight to smaller investors —
especially individuals who have little financial expertise but want to benefit
from the potential returns that come with mutual funds and stock ownership.
Rigid regulations govern mutual fund operations, initial public offerings of
securities, and licensing for brokers. However, lawmakers also understand that
some investors know the risks they’re taking and that these investors can
afford to take them. The government allows these folks to invest in securities
with much less regulatory oversight: venture capital, private offerings, and
hedge funds, to name a few.
Rather than make investors take a test of their financial knowledge, the SEC
has set different asset thresholds. The following section covers all the rea-
sons in detail; here, I give you the quick and dirty on the different types of
investors.
30
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

Accredited investor
An accredited investor is an individual who can enter into a hedge fund due to
his or her financial standing. An investor is considered accredited if he or she
meets any of the following criteria:
 Has a net worth of more than $1 million, owned alone or jointly with a
spouse
 Has earned $200,000 in each of the past two years
 Has earned $300,000 in each of the past two years when combined with
a spouse
 Has a reasonable expectation of making the same amount in the future
For investment institutions, such as pensions, endowments, and trusts, the
primary qualification is having $5 million in assets.
The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term accredited
investor under Rule 501 of Regulation D as follows:
1. A bank, insurance company, registered investment company, business
development company, or small business investment company
2. An employee benefit plan, within the meaning of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act — if a bank, insurance company, or registered invest-
ment adviser makes the investment decisions or if the plan has total
assets in excess of $5 million
3. A charitable organization, corporation, or partnership with assets
exceeding $5 million
4. A director, executive officer, or general partner of the company selling
the securities
5. A business in which all the equity owners are accredited investors
6. A natural person who has individual net worth, or joint net worth with
the person’s spouse, that exceeds $1 million at the time of the purchase
7. A natural person with income exceeding $200,000 in each of the two
most recent years, or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for
those years, and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in
the current year
8. A trust with assets in excess of $5 million — not formed to acquire the
securities offered — whose purchases a sophisticated person makes
See Chapter 3 for more information on accreditation and registration.
31
Chapter 2: Examining How Hedge Funds Are Structured

Qualified purchaser
Many hedge funds set a more stringent standard than the SEC, asking that
investors be qualified purchasers under their own internal guidelines. Typically,
qualified purchasers are individuals with at least $5 million in investable
assets. Trusts, endowments, and pensions must have at least $25 million in
investable assets. Investors who meet a firm’s qualified-purchaser standards
are sometimes called super accredited.
Funds go above and beyond because of concerns that the accredited-investor
definition hasn’t been indexed for inflation (it was last revised in 1982, when
a dollar was worth more than twice what it’s worth today). Many people now
meet the definition thanks to appreciation in residential real estate or self-
directed retirement savings. An investor may have $1 million in assets, but
that doesn’t mean he’s knowledgeable enough or solvent enough to invest in
lightly regulated hedge funds.
Some firms may not set a qualified-purchaser standard, but they set their
minimum-investment standards for their limited partners high enough that
they may as well have a rule in place. For example, a hedge fund may demand
that its new investors put in at least $1 million or $5 million, which eliminates
a novice investor who has most of her wealth in her house and her IRA
account.
Why do hedge fund investors need 
to be qualified or accredited?
A million bucks in assets? An income of $200,000 per year? No fair! Not so fast —
Paris Hilton is proof that money has nothing to do with sophistication and sound
decision-making. Maybe she’s the reason the little investor can’t be in a hedge
fund!
From the hedge fund manager’s perspective, he or she has two very practical
reasons for requiring investors to be accredited or qualified. The first is that
the administrative work that comes with a large number of small accounts is
much greater than with a small number of large accounts.
The second reason is a legal matter. No, a fund won’t get in trouble if it sells
to unaccredited investors; it just can’t charge performance fees. Under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, registered funds can’t charge performance
fees unless their investors invest at least $750,000 or have a net worth of $1.5
million. Hedge fund managers don’t want to lose their big bonuses because
small investors clutter their funds (see the section “Fee, Fi, Fo, Cha Ching!
Paying the Fees Associated with Hedge Funds” for more on fund fees).
32
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

Do funds really check up on you?
What if your net worth is $999,000, and a hedge fund requires that its
investors have $1 million in assets? You’re so close! Will the fund let you
squeak in? It depends. The fund may force you to sign a statement saying that
you’re accredited and that you meet any other standards the fund has set. It
may ask for proof in the form of W2 forms, tax returns, or account state-
ments. Heck, the fund may take your word for it.
In any event, if your investment in the fund doesn’t work out, you can’t argue
that the fund manager took advantage of a little guy like you.
Most funds have a simple way to verify their investors’ net worth: They ask
for big upfront investments or commitments. You may be able to borrow the
money to invest in a hedge fund (using some leveraging of your own; see
Chapter 11), but any lender will likely want proof that you can repay your
loan, even if the investment goes south.
Do I have alternatives if I don’t qualify?
If you don’t qualify for a hedge fund as an accredited or qualified investor,
you may be tempted to put this book down and pick up a copy of Frugal
Living For Dummies (by Deborah Taylor-Hough [Wiley]). That’s a good and
useful book, no matter your income, but don’t give up on Hedge Funds For
Dummies yet. I still have useful information for you! The following sections
give you options if you don’t qualify for a hedge fund outright.
Using hedge-fund strategies within a small portfolio
Understanding how hedge funds work can help you make better choices
among mutual funds or help you balance a large position in your company’s
stock. Part III of this book outlines many of the strategies that hedge funds
use to gain a high return. And if you flip to Chapter 16, you’ll see plenty of
ideas for using these strategies in a smaller investment portfolio.
Finding mutual funds that use hedge-fund strategies
Some mutual fund companies offer funds designed to capture the benefits of
hedge funds within the highly regulated mutual-fund structure. For example,
some mutual funds now follow a long-short strategy — they can buy stocks
expected to go up and sell short stocks expected to go down. (To sell short, a
fund manager borrows an asset, sells it, and then buys the asset back at a
lower price to repay the original asset lender. The fund makes money if the
asset falls in price; see Chapter 11.) Janus and Laudus Rosenberg are among
33
Chapter 2: Examining How Hedge Funds Are Structured

the fund companies that offer these funds. Chapters 15 and 16 cover mutual
funds that use hedge-fund techniques in great detail. You can also check out
Mutual Funds For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Eric Tyson (Wiley), for more gen-
eral info on mutual funds.
Following the Cash Flow 
within a Hedge Fund
As counterintuitive as it may sound, cash isn’t always good. Cash manage-
ment is a huge challenge for any investment manager, causing some hedge
fund managers to turn down money. They do this because until they can use
new funds to buy securities that they expect to appreciate in price, the cash
sits in the funds, earning very little interest. That lack of activity quickly puts
a drag on the overall performance of the funds. The sad truth is that in some
market climates, fund managers simply can’t find any good investments that
fit their funds’ parameters.
In the following sections, I present the strategies that hedge funds use during
periods of market inactivity, and I outline the policies that some hedge funds
use regarding withdrawals and closings.
Substituting commitments for cash
To give their funds time to put cash to work without diluting performance,
many hedge fund managers ask new investors for commitments rather than
for cash up front. For example, say an investor wants to invest $5 million. A
fund manager asks for a commitment for the entire $5 million, but she takes
only $1 million for an initial investment. After she puts the initial money to
work by purchasing securities that she expects to appreciate, she goes back
to the investor for some or all the remaining $4 million.
If a hedge fund asks for only part of an investment with a commitment to fund
the rest at a later date, you have to be ready to write the check. You may
decide to have the money sitting in cash, earning a low rate of return, until
the hedge fund manager is ready for the money. And the hedge fund gets all
the glory of great performance!
The following table shows another numerical example. If a hedge fund man-
ager doesn’t see any great investment opportunities, she can increase return
by limiting how much money the investor puts in:
34

$5,000,000

$1,000,000

manager gets to report a higher return on her portion:

Waiting for withdrawals and distributions
Many hedge funds specialize in complex illiquid investments; in other 
words, it may not be easy for the fund to sell a security and get full price 
for it. Because of that fact, most hedge funds limit the amount and timing of
investment withdrawals. Funds may even require investors to give notice 
of withdrawals in order to allow the fund manager time to generate cash 
without disrupting the overall portfolio (see Chapter 7 for more info on 
this topic).
Some hedge funds go further than limiting withdrawals to once per quarter
or once per year — they may not allow investors to withdraw their money for
more than two years.
35
Chapter 2: Examining How Hedge Funds Are Structured

Sometimes, a hedge fund gets so big that the fund manager can’t find any more
great investments that fit the fund’s investment strategy. At that point, he may
start returning the fund’s money to his investors. Whether they want them or
not, the investors get their checks, and they have to find other places to put
their money — places that meet their desired risk and return parameters.
A hedge fund’s need for cash may not fit yours. The fund may not be able 
to invest all the money that you want it to; it may not be able to give your
money back when you need it; or it may send you a check when you least
expect it, hurting your ability to meet your financial goals. This is another
reason only accredited investors are allowed in hedge funds. Anyone who
depends on cash in a hedge fund for any outside reasons has no business
investing in the fund. (See Chapter 7 for more information on hedge fund
cash flows and what they mean to your investment needs.)
Regular payment distributions
Many hedge funds make regular distributions to their investors. Once per
quarter, or once per year, for example, a fund may send its investors some
portion of the fund’s earned income (dividends and interest) and capital
gains (asset price appreciation).
Although the amount returned to investors may vary greatly each time, the
process has some benefits:
 It helps reduce pressure for withdrawals by allowing investors to get
some cash out.
 It helps the fund manager keep the size of the fund matched to the avail-
able investment opportunities in the market, according to the strategy
the fund currently follows.
 It makes it easier for taxable investors to pay the IRS (see Chapter 8 for
more information).
Be sure to ask the fund manager about this policy during your initial inter-
view (see Chapter 18).
Extraordinary distributions
Many hedge funds are reluctant to commit to regular schedules for monetary
distributions because a commitment would limit their investment flexibility.
Instead, these funds choose to make distributions when cash builds up beyond
the managers’ abilities to put the money to work in suitable investments. A
fund manager gets the excess money out by issuing an extraordinary distribu-
tion to his investors, and then he focuses on investing the remaining funds.
The money goes to investors in proportion to the amount that each has
invested in the fund.
36
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

Extraordinary distributions are called return of capital because the fund man-
ager reduces the amount of money that each investor has in the fund. A
return of capital can be a quick way to increase performance on a percentage
basis by making the overall fund size smaller. As with regular distributions,
an extraordinary distribution may be good for the manager, but not always
for the investor, who needs to find another investment opportunity that
matches his or her desired risk-and-return profile.
A liquidation with no sale: Closing the fund
For one reason or another, hedge funds close all the time. Industry observers
estimate that 10 to 15 percent of hedge funds close each year. They may send
you a letter in the mail, along with a check for your investment (unless your
partnership agreement specifies otherwise), and you have to pack up shop,
too. But why?
 The manager can’t find good investment opportunities in the market
that match the fund’s strategy.
 Sometimes, a hedge fund gives up after a string of losses — especially
when the fund manager doesn’t make money anymore.
 Hedge fund managers sometimes get bored with their work and quit,
even if their funds have solid performances. (This doesn’t happen often;
the money hedge fund managers make can buy a lot of excitement.)
Whatever the reason, the fund manager closes the fund, sells the fund’s
assets, pays off its liabilities, and distributes whatever’s left to the investors.
Fee, Fi, Fo, Cha Ching! Paying the 
Fees Associated with Hedge Funds
Ever since the first hedge fund, started by Alfred Winslow Jones in the late
1940s, funds have charged investors fees. The norm is a combination of a 
management fee and a performance fee. Almost all funds formed since Jones’s
have used a similar structure — a 1- or 2-percent management fee and a 20-
percent performance fee — although some funds may charge different rates.
In addition, you may have to pay a fee to get into a hedge fund, and the fund
may want more when you get out.
Why should you have to pay for all the risk involved with a hedge fund? I can
give you a couple reasons besides return. Although a hedge fund manager
probably has some of her personal money invested in the fund, she needs
cash to pay the fund’s operating expenses. She also wants an incentive for
37
Chapter 2: Examining How Hedge Funds Are Structured

the risk she’s taking in starting and operating the fund in order to make her-
self and all her client’s money.
In the following sections, I discuss all the fees that drain a bit of money from
your bottom line but that give life to the hedge-fund business.
All these fees reduce the return that you receive. If your hedge fund gener-
ates a high return, the amount you give will be worth it. If not, being in the
fund will just be expensive.
Management fees
A hedge fund can be an expensive business to run. The general partners of
the fund have to worry about paying for many areas of the business, includ-
ing the following:
 Rent and utility costs of the office space, telephones, computers, pens,
paper, and so on
 The price of research services, specialized software, and brokerage 
commissions
 The salaries for the fund managers and staff
 The lawyers and accountants who track the fund’s assets and help it
comply with applicable regulations
All these supplies and employees cost money. And who pays for it all? The
fund investors.
Most funds charge management fees of about 1 percent to 2 percent of the
fund’s assets, usually at the end of the fiscal year. Some charge higher fees —
especially if they follow strategies that involve expensive research and related
expenses, such as shareholder activism (see Chapter 12 for more information
on that topic). Other funds keep the fee relatively low by paying only some
expenses out of the fee; the funds pay for other bills, especially legal and
accounting expenses, directly out of funds assets. You need to find out upfront
what management fees a prospective fund charges, what other expenses the
fund incurs, and how the fund calculates its fees (see Chapter 18 for more on
due diligence).
A hedge fund manager receives a management fee no matter how the fund
performs. However, if the fund’s assets increase, the fee does, too. Two per-
cent of $60,000,000 is more than 2 percent of $50,000,000, so a 20-percent
investment return translates into a 20-percent increase in management fees.
38
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

Sales charges
Hedge funds incur expenses throughout the year. They may take their man-
agement fees on a periodic basis, like once per quarter or once every six
months, but the rate of fee collection may not match the rate at which the
bills come in. Some funds may need money up front in order to operate, so
they charge upfront sales charges — often at the same scale as the manage-
ment fees (1 percent to 2 percent that comes out of the amount invested).
The sales charge allows the fund to cover its expenses and pay its staff until
the management fees and performance fees come in.
Performance fees
Hedge fund managers charge performance fees as a reward for getting excel-
lent returns for their investors. One of the many appeals of hedge funds is
that the managers eat their own cooking, as the saying goes — their incen-
tives are aligned with their investors’ goals. If the fund doesn’t make money,
the fund manager doesn’t get paid.
A typical performance fee is 20 percent of the fund’s annual profits before
fees. Some funds charge a higher rate if performance is above a predeter-
mined benchmark — say, 20 percent on investment returns of up to 50 per-
cent and 35 percent on any returns generated over 50 percent.
Performance fees come with a downside for fund managers: The fund only
gets paid if it turns profit, and most funds set what’s called a high water mark.
The fund can only charge a performance fee if the fund’s assets return to
where they were before the fund started losing money. If it had $10 million in
year one and lost 10 percent, making the asset value $9 million, the manager
can’t charge a performance fee until the assets appreciate back to $10 mil-
lion. See Table 2-1 for examples of the ebb and flow of performance fees.
Is the high water mark a good thing for investors? It depends. The fund man-
ager pays a penalty for not making money, which is a powerful incentive to
manage the fund well. However, the loss of a performance fee for more than a
year can be painful to the fund manager. If the fund loses a large amount of
money in its bad year, it may take a while for the asset values to recover.
Sometimes, a hedge fund manager will disband a fund after a losing year and
then launch a new fund instead of losing out on a few years of performance
fees. In the investment business, very good years often follow very bad years,
so disbanding the fund means that the fund’s investors lose out on what could
be a year of great performance that would help them recoup their losses.

Note: At the end of the second year, the fund’s assets are below where they
ended in the first year. Until the fund’s assets recover, the fund manager won’t
receive a performance fee.
Hedge fund investors may well be ready to accept the crunchy with the
smooth, so many want to reduce the fund manager’s incentive to disband 
the fund after a loss. After all, a few years of poor performance may be part
and parcel of a great long-term investment strategy. Some funds address this
desire of investors by calling for graduated performance fees that may give
the fund managers some of the performance-fee money while they climb back
up to the high water mark. For example, a fund manager may receive a perfor-
mance fee of 10 percent of profits until the fund reaches the high-water mark,
at which point she gets the full 20 percent of profits thereafter.
Redemption fees
You pay money while you’re in the hedge fund, and you may have to pay
money to get into the fund in the first place, but at least you’re off the hook
when you get out, right? Nope! Many hedge funds charge redemption fees
when their investors withdraw their money. These fees may be another 1 per-
cent to 2 percent of assets. One reason funds charge redemption fees is that
they can. Another reason is that they increase the money that the fund man-
ager earns. But I can give you some better reasons, too. Hedge funds want to
impress upon their limited partners that investment is a long-term proposi-
tion, so they can’t get out easily. Also, the general partners have to deal with
sales and administrative costs involved with raising the money to meet the
redemption.
A hedge fund that charges a redemption fee may waive it if it has held the
investment for a certain amount of time, or if you provide a certain amount of
notice about when you plan to withdraw the funds.
Commissions
If you employ a broker or consultant to find a suitable hedge fund for you,
and this person introduces you to the general partners, he or she will expect
to be paid for said services. The consultant may charge you a flat fee, or he
or she may take a percentage of the assets invested. To find out more about
the function of a consultant and the benefits of the services provided, check
out Chapter 17.

Chapter 2: Examining How Hedge Funds Are Structured

Dealing with the Hedge Fund Manager
Many money managers choose to run hedge funds because they don’t want all
the headaches that come with running big businesses (and because they want
a lot of money). The managers dream of sitting in front of trading screens and
making investment decisions all day. They want to avoid sitting in meetings,
holding the hands of their nervous clients, or making presentations to market-
ing departments. However, many hedge fund investors want regular contact
with the people managing their money, and they want the niceties of notes,
golf outings, and occasional dinners. Therefore, many hedge fund managers
often hire marketing employees to work with clients so that they can concen-
trate on running the money. It helps to know a fund manager’s policies on
meetings and communication, so I cover these topics in the sections that
follow.
The partnership agreement you sign will probably discuss what kind of com-
munication the hedge fund manager wants to arrange and how often he’ll
make contact. See the previous section for more on contract talk.
Making time for meetings
How often you hold meetings with your fund manager depends on the fund
you enter and the fund manager’s style. After the initial investment meeting,
some funds hold quarterly or annual meetings for all their investors. Other
fund managers never meet with their investors again. Some fund managers
make an effort to say hello whenever investors come to town, and others
prefer to be undisturbed.
If you feel like you have to have regular, face-to-face communication with the
hedge fund manager you associate with, make sure a manager is amenable to
this request before you commit your money.
Communicating with the written word
Your hedge fund manager should offer you a quarterly report on the fund’s
investment performance to date, giving you a sense of where the returns are
relative to the appropriate investment benchmarks and letting you know how
42
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

the market outlook suits the fund’s strategy. (You can read more about per-
formance calculation in Chapter 14.)
You may also want to read through a prospective fund’s report archives
before you invest to discover more about the fund’s investment style and
communication philosophy.
Once a year, your fund manager should give you a comprehensive report on the
fund’s performance, including the total value of the assets under management
and the total fees charged. An outside auditor should prepare this report — not
the hedge fund manager. Make sure of this before you sign up. You probably
won’t get a comprehensive list of holdings; it depends on the fund’s trans-
parency views (see Chapters 8 and 9). But you should get enough information
on industry and asset classes to get a sense of the fund’s overall risk-and-return
profile, which helps you evaluate how the fund’s performance fits your port-
folio needs.
Hedge funds are private partnerships. It’s reasonable to expect regular per-
formance information, including such risk measures as Value at Risk (see
Chapter 14). It isn’t reasonable to expect much more. When it comes to how
much written communication is allowed from an investor to a fund manager,
you have to look at it case by case.
Seeking Alternatives to Hedge Funds
After you discover more information about how hedge funds operate and are
structured, you may realize that you don’t have the assets or the desire to
invest in them right now. Maybe the structure of the whole operation scares
you off. That’s okay! You have other ways to put the performance and risk-
management advantages of hedge funds to work in your portfolio.
Table 2-2 gives you a basic overview of how hedge funds compare to other
types of investments; the following sections delve deeper into the topic.

Making mutual funds work for you
A mutual fund is a company formed to buy securities and registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Most mutual funds are open-ended,
which means they offer shares to the public every day. Anyone with enough
money on hand can buy the shares, regardless of net worth or income, and
anyone in a mutual fund can cash out the shares at any time.
For a long time, mutual funds couldn’t use most options and futures trading
strategies (see Chapters 5 and 10 for more on these topics) or techniques
such as short-selling or leveraging (see Chapter 11). The regulation that pro-
hibited the strategies, known as the Short-Short Rule, was repealed in 1997.
However, few mutual funds availed themselves of the new techniques because
investors weren’t interested at the time. Now that people are more aware of
hedge funds, they want mutual-fund alternatives, and the fund companies are
delivering.
You can discover more about mutual funds that hedge in Chapters 15 and 16.
Profiting from pooled accounts
If several investors put their money together to invest, the result is a pooled
account. This account can be small, like an investment club formed by a
handful of people who want to discover more about buying stocks, or it can
be very large. Some pooled accounts are more or less mutual funds for insti-
tutional investors. For example, several churches may pool their endow-
ments under one investment manager. One large nonprofit organization,
Commonfund (www.commonfund.org), offers several pooled account
options for university endowments and other nonprofit organizations.
A hedge fund is a type of pooled account, but it follows more aggressive
investment strategies and charges performance fees. Some pooled accounts
avoid performance fees so they can attract investors who have more money
than a mutual fund can invest efficiently, but who aren’t qualified to invest in
a hedge fund.
Entering individually managed accounts
A portfolio manager or broker manages an individually managed account for a
specific account holder. The person managing the account can customize it
to your needs, using aggressive strategies or hedging techniques where
45
Chapter 2: Examining How Hedge Funds Are Structured

appropriate. You can structure individually managed accounts in many ways
and find many different managers who can run your account.
Individual money manager
A money manager may be willing to take on individual accounts, especially
for high-net-worth individuals who want lower fees, more flexibility, and more
transparency than may be available with a hedge fund. To a large extent, the
money manager operates these accounts like pooled accounts (see the previ-
ous section). She may have several individual accounts with a growth strat-
egy, so she buys the same stocks for each of them, for example. But if one of
her accounts has a unique tax situation, she can manage the account without
affecting any of her other accounts. An individual account manager charges a
fee based on the assets held, so she has an incentive to protect her clients’
assets. The downside is that the return after fees may not be any better than
with any other type of account.
Brokerage discretionary account
Many stockbrokers have a good sense of how to invest, so they may offer to
make decisions for some of their clients (or take them up on offers). When
they do, they open a discretionary account, because the client signs over dis-
cretion for the assets to the stockbroker.
This route is generally a bad idea. You pay a stockbroker on commission. The
more trades ordered for your account, the more you pay the broker. Some
brokers are good and responsible people. Others churn through every asset
their clients possess if it means that they take home the maximum possible
commission. Don’t enter into a discretionary-account agreement lightly.
Family offices
If a family has enough money — especially inherited wealth or money from a
business owned by generations of family members — its members may use a
family-office service to handle the family’s financial affairs. These offices often
sit in departments of private banks that work with several families. Some fam-
ilies, like the Rockefellers, may be able to justify having an office that works
only for them. Typical family offices offer tax- and estate-planning services,
bill paying, and education planning. No hedge fund is going to offer these ser-
vices. The family office may also manage the assets of the family. The family
office asset manager may or may not use hedging techniques, depending on
the family’s needs and circumstances.

ecause hedge funds don’t have to register with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), hedge funds can pursue investment
strategies that other types of investment pools can’t. For example, hedge
funds have more freedom to borrow money to increase return, concentrate
money into a handful of positions, and invest in assets that can’t be easily
sold. This freedom also means that hedge fund managers don’t have to dis-
close their investment techniques (which can be good for return [see
Chapter 6] but bad for your due diligence [see Chapter 18]), and they’re 
free to change course with the prevailing market winds.
The ability to invest in ways that other types of investments can’t is a major
part of the hedge-fund appeal. And the major benefit of this perk? The pursuit
of higher return for less risk. But without certain regulations, investors face
another risk: that the people running their funds aren’t who they say they
are, and that the funds aren’t handling money appropriately.
When hedge funds were the exclusive province of very wealthy individuals
and well-endowed institutions, a lack of transparency wasn’t a huge concern.
Regulators figured that investors could afford to do their own due diligence
(and to lose some money). But over the years, hedge funds have increased in
popularity with smaller investors. It’s all relative, but a million ain’t what it
used to be. One million in 2005 was only worth $492,942 in 1982, the last time
the accredited-investor threshold was raised (see Chapter 2). You may be
rich, but are you rich enough to meet the demands of the hedge fund busi-
ness? That’s the issue that regulators grapple with now.

Hedge funds don’t have to register with the SEC because they’re designed for
sophisticated investors: individuals with a net worth of $1 million or an annual
income of $200,000 ($300,000 for married couples), and institutions holding
assets of $5 million. In 2006, the SEC began requiring some hedge funds to reg-
ister. Later in the year, a court ruled that the agency didn’t have the authority
to require such registration. Now the entire requirement is in limbo, and it’s
unclear what the funds that are already registered will do. Some hedge funds
are registered, some are not, and Congress will likely pass legislation reinstat-
ing some type of registration requirement. Stay tuned!
So, as an investor, why should you care about SEC registration? For one thing,
registration and transparency are ongoing controversies in the hedge-fund
industry. The freedom from regulation and disclosure may help funds earn
better returns, but it also scares off some investors and allows unscrupulous
managers to rip off others. You also need to know the limited protections of
registration if you intend to invest in a registered fund, as well as the reasons
why a fund may choose to avoid registration. This chapter helps you become
familiar with registration so you can make better decisions with your money.
Getting to Know the SEC’s Stance 
on Registration and Regulation
In September 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
issued a 134-page document discussing hedge funds. In the document, the
commission made the following statements: “We are concerned about our
inability to examine hedge fund advisers and evaluate the effect of the strate-
gies used in managing hedge funds on our financial market.” “We also are
concerned about the lack of applicable regulatory measures necessary to
ensure that material information to assist investors in making fully informed
investment decisions is available.”
More recently, regulators have been concerned about the increased popular-
ity of hedge funds and the way that inflation has lowered the relative height
of the accredited-investor requirement. They also worry about a few hedge
fund scandals that have dotted the newswire, including stories of hedge fund
managers who took investors’ money and spent it instead of investing for
maximum return relative to risk. (I cover some of these stories in Chapter 18;
you won’t spoil anything if you flip there now.)
The SEC’s primary concern is that the original definition of an accredited
investor — a person with at least $1 million in assets or a yearly income of
$200,000 ($300,000 for a married couple) — hasn’t been adjusted for inflation
48
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

for over 20 years. Between increasing real-estate prices, individually managed
retirement accounts, and general increases in asset values across the board,
many investors found themselves with enough assets to qualify; however,
they didn’t necessarily have the investment sophistication nor the resources
envisioned when the original criteria were set.
In the following sections, I discuss some of the issues surrounding regulation.
As of press time, the issue is up in the air; the SEC’s hedge-fund registration
program has stopped by court order, but it seems likely that Congress will
call for new regulations or registration systems in order to protect investors
from unscrupulous operators. Understanding the philosophy and history of
regulations will help you evaluate news events to see how they affect your
portfolio. And, the information here gives you some good context for due dili-
gence (see Chapter 18).
Examining the SEC’s past and current 
policies on registration
When it first proposed registration, the SEC didn’t try to take on the tough
job of defining “hedge fund.” (Chapter 1 looks at the many ways that people
use the term.) Instead, it created a new term for it, “private fund,” and used
that to extend the coverage of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to include
what we typically think of as a hedge fund. As a policy matter, the agency
required that certain funds register in order to ensure that investors in these
funds receive a minimum level of disclosure about management practices.
The SEC also wanted to ensure some level of oversight and enforcement
power at the Commission’s disposal.
The SEC wasn’t concerned with investment strategies — only fund opera-
tions. Specifically, the Commission looked at the following criteria for a regis-
tered hedge fund:
 Are the principals qualified to run the fund’s money?
 Can investors find out if they’re qualified?
 Have the fund managers explained the risks of the fund’s strategy?
 Are accounting systems in place to value the fund’s assets and handle
the cash flow?
 Can investors withdraw their money on a timely basis?
Recognizing that hedge funds operate in an entrepreneurial industry and that
the process is expensive, the Commission voted in 2004 to require registra-
tion only of funds with $25 million in assets or more. Smaller funds, which are
49
Chapter 3: Not Just a Sleeping Aid: Analyzing SEC Registration

more apt to attract less-sophisticated investors and have more trouble meeting
operational requirements, didn’t have to register. Most of the problem funds
(which you can read about in Chapter 18) fall into the smaller category because
they’re less likely to be of interest to larger, more experienced investors.
In other words, the big investors who were protected because of their own
market power gained no new safeguards, and smaller investors who lacked nego-
tiating power with hedge fund managers continued to be without safeguards.
The main reason that the court threw out the hedge-fund registration require-
ment is that it felt the SEC didn’t have the authority to require registration
without an act of Congress. A secondary reason is that the requirement didn’t
seem to address abusive funds that harmed smaller investors.
Without the protection of registration, investors must look out for them-
selves when entering the hedge fund world for the most part. The following
sections aim to arm you with info that can help out during the process.
First thing we do, we hire the lawyers
As a prospective hedge fund investor, you may find it helpful to know what a
hedge fund manager goes through when setting up a fund. Knowing the right way
to do business will help you better identify folks who go about it the wrong way.
For starters, a hedge fund manager needs a strong legal team, and her
lawyers should be specialists in SEC compliance matters to help ensure that
all paperwork is filled out correctly and turned in on time. A lawyer with a
focus on SEC compliance specializes in securities cases and has handled reg-
istration for other investment advisers. A strong legal team also gives you,
the prospective investor, some assurance that the fund is professionally man-
aged. And no, it isn’t cheap to the fund, which is one of many reasons why
hedge funds charge relatively high fees (see Chapters 2 and 4).
The securities industry is considered to be self-regulating, but that doesn’t
mean that hedge funds regulate themselves. Instead, it means that the SEC has
delegated much of the compliance work to the exchanges and related organi-
zations: the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, among others. A
good securities lawyer should know these organizations inside and out and
will make sure that anybody required to receive paperwork will get it.
In addition, the SEC requires a registered hedge fund to do the following:
 Maintain certain records, such as trade histories and banking records
 Establish in-house compliance monitoring procedures
 Have a compliance officer on staff
50
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

A compliance officer will probably be a lawyer who has securities experience.
No matter what degree the compliance officer holds, he or she needs to have
extensive experience with SEC regulations, exchange policies, and good trad-
ing and documentation practices. You should ask about the hedge fund’s
legal counsel and registration policies when you conduct an interview with
the fund manager (see Chapter 18).
Reviewing the registration process
The Securities and Exchange Commission requires funds to go through several
steps if they decide to register (to attract more investors, for example) — a
process that the fund can handle electronically. The Commission is one of 
several sponsors of the online Investment Adviser Registration Depository,
www.iard.com, which walks the hedge-fund operator through the whole
process. At the conclusion of the process, many of the documents become
public information, so you can use them to help evaluate fund managers.
The Investment Adviser Registration Depository Web site is deceptively
simple. Don’t be fooled — registration isn’t a do-it-yourself project. An error
or omission may have tremendous repercussions down the line. A hedge fund
manager should shell out the money for qualified legal advice, and a hedge
fund investor should run in fright from a firm that doesn’t have access to
good counsel (see the previous section for more on legal matters).
The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) oversees the registra-
tion process as a whole. The following list outlines some of the many forms
that a fund has to complete under the watchful eye of this organization:
 Entitlement Forms: Before the National Association of Securities Dealers
lets a firm begin the filing process, it requires the firm to show that it’s a
bona fide investment business with proper eligibility and to list the per-
sons who will have access to the system. In other words, not just anyone
can start an investment business. If you’re evaluating an unregistered
hedge fund, you may want to use the entitlement form to help generate
some due-diligence questions. If it helps the NASD determine if a fund is
bona fide, it can help you.
 Form ADV Part 1: Form ADV registers an investment advisory firm.
(ADV is short for “advisory”.) Part 1 includes information on the advi-
sor’s experience, business history, and last 10 years of disciplinary his-
tory. It also requires the advisor to identify his business within the fund.
The advisor must file this form electronically, so you can look up an
advisor’s information at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. And if a fund
isn’t registered, you can use a blank copy of the form to help design your
due diligence.
51
Chapter 3: Not Just a Sleeping Aid: Analyzing SEC Registration

 Form ADV Part 2: Part 2 of the ADV lays out the fund’s services, fees,
and investment strategies. Money-management firms don’t have to file
Part 2 with the SEC, but they must keep the forms current and make
them available upon request to the Commission and to current and
prospective clients. Part 2 gives the kind of information a hedge fund
investor should expect, whether or not the fund is registered. A hedge
fund manager can give you this information without putting it on file.
 Form ADV-W: Notice of Withdrawal as an Investment Advisor. When a
firm leaves the investment business for whatever reason, it files this
form with the SEC. You may see many forms going on file now that the
courts have ruled that registration isn’t necessary. The filing of the form
doesn’t mean that hedge fund is a bad one; just that it’s no longer doing
the legal work involved in staying registered.
 Form ADV-H: This is the hardship exemption, allowing firms to post-
pone the electronic filing of their Form ADVs. The SEC usually grants the
exemption for technical difficulties with access to the electronic filing
system. The filing of this form isn’t something you should expect to see
from a well-run hedge fund, so you should avoid a fund that asks for the
exemption.
 U4: Do you remember the permanent record that your elementary
school counselor told you would follow you for the rest of your life? The
U4 is the closest thing to it for employees at registered broker/dealers
and investment advisory firms, which may include registered hedge
funds, funds of funds, and brokers who sell hedge funds. Fund operators
must fill out detailed information on where they’ve lived and where
they’ve worked for the past 10 years. They also need to submit finger-
prints, and any disciplinary information is included. Data from the U4 is
available for two years after a person leaves a registered firm; you can
look up fund operators at the NASD’s BrokerCheck at pdpi.nasdr.
com/PDPI.
Yes, the NASD checks those fingerprints. A new employee at a money-
management firm where I worked noted on her job application that she
had never been convicted of a felony. But when she filed her U4 and the
NASD checked her fingerprints, it found that she was convicted for
felony shoplifting. Ooops! The firm promptly fired her for lying on her
job application. Others have passed the fingerprint screen but embell-
ished their educational or work experience. Lying on a U4 isn’t a crime,
but it is subject to civil disciplinary action — fines, a ban on working in
the industry, and so on. Most employers see it as a firing offense. A
prospective investor who uncovers a falsehood during due diligence
should consider placing his or her money elsewhere.
 U5: A notification that an employee at a registered firm has left the firm.
The U5 includes the reasons for the departure. Firms use the U5 to
update a person’s U4.

Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

Meeting investor needs with regulation
What does the regulation process have to do with you, the hedge fund
investor? Should hedge funds even be regulated? Many would make a case
that hedge funds shouldn’t be subject to regulation because their advantage
lies in their ability to invest freely without disclosing their activities. But in
exchange for relief from regulatory requirements, it seems likely that the gov-
ernment will make funds made available to fewer investors. Would you rather
have more regulation or a stricter accredited-investor requirement (see
Chapter 2)? It all depends on where you stand. The following list outlines
some benefits of regulation:
 Regulation may give the SEC more tools for detecting fraud and more
teeth after a detection. In particular, tougher rules may allow the agency
to find fraud at an early stage, before investors have lost all their money.
 Regulation may improve the markets by finally giving everyone reliable
information about the numbers and types of funds in operation. To date,
such data has been the province of consulting firms (see Chapter 17),
which charge for their services and may be biased in how they collect
and report information. The lack of information has allowed some hedge
funds to misrepresent themselves and make it harder for market
researchers to model different risk scenarios.
 Finally, regulation would help smaller hedge funds establish good com-
pliance practices. Many large funds already have compliance practices
in place, whether or not they actually register. Other funds haven’t paid
much attention to the practices, placing the entire burden on the
investor during due diligence.
Realizing that “registered” 
doesn’t mean “approved”
No need to fret because the registration requirement has been repealed — at
least for a while. Registration wasn’t and will never be a seal of approval. The
Securities and Exchange Commission ensures only that a fund has met the
disclosure requirements of the law; it doesn’t let you know if a fund is prop-
erly operated or a good investment. Do your own due diligence if you want to
stamp a seal of approval (see Chapter 18 for more information).
The SEC considers a fund’s registration to be effective when it’s made.
However, Commission staff members will review the registration for com-
pleteness, and they may ask the hedge fund for changes or to submit addi-
tional information.
53
Chapter 3: Not Just a Sleeping Aid: Analyzing SEC Registration

In some cases, if a firm files incorrect or incomplete information on its Form
ADV (see the previous section), the knowledge of the mistake doesn’t come
out until after the fund collapses or people make allegations of fraud. For
example, many advisors have lied on their U4s but get discovered only when
a prospective investor calls up their Ivy-covered alma maters to verify their
graduation dates. The SEC doesn’t approve of a firm’s filings; it only verifies
that the filings are complete, which is why you need to investigate a fund
even if it registers with the SEC.
Addressing registration at the state level
Just because the Feds don’t require registration right now doesn’t mean that
certain state legislations won’t step into the void. Many hedge funds are
headquartered in the state of Connecticut, and that state is considering
stricter regulations as of press time because it believes that the current SEC
regulations are inadequate. And you can bet that if a spectacular hedge-fund
collapse happens in any state, elected officials looking for political gain will
promote a new round of regulations.
If a hedge fund does register with the SEC, it doesn’t need to register with any
state. But if it isn’t registered, the fund may have to register in states where it
operates or where it has investors. How do you know? The quickest way to
an answer is a phone call to your appropriate state regulator. You can find a
directory on the North American Securities Administrators Association Web
site — www.nasaa.org.

Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 
Pulling laws out of the blue sky
The term “blue sky laws” has been used for
about 100 years, but the exact source of it is
unknown. It appears to come from criticisms of
fraudsters who conned investors into schemes
with no basis other than the sky above. These
laws predate Federal securities laws.
By 1996, it became clear that the blue sky laws
were more effective at creating additional work
for lawyers than for providing information and
protection to investors. The National Securities
Markets Improvement Act of 1996 repealed blue
sky laws that duplicate Federal laws, leaving
most states toothless.

Going Costal: Avoiding the Registration
Debate through Offshore Funds
One way to get around U.S. investing laws is to operate outside of the United
States. No kidding! Most nations have their own securities laws that apply,
but one class of hedge funds seems to be almost lawless: offshore funds.
Offshore funds are operated out of offshore banking centers — a handful of
locations that allow investment businesses to operate with limited regulation
and taxation. The International Monetary Fund defines offshore banking cen-
ters as
 Locations with relatively large numbers of financial institutions working
primarily with nonresidents.
 National financial systems with external assets and liabilities that are
out of proportion to the domestic financial needs.
 Places where low or zero taxation, light financial regulation, banking
secrecy, and anonymous transactions are readily available.
Among the many offshore banking centers found around the world appear in
Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Marianas, Mauritius,
and Singapore. (Of course, a fund manager may be making investment deci-
sions from an office in his house in Greenwich, Connecticut. Hey, it’s a global
economy, and bandwidth is cheap.) But even places like New York, Tokyo,
and London offer services that qualify under the International Monetary
Fund’s definition — as long as you aren’t a citizen of the country.
An offshore hedge fund may be able to shelter money from taxes and operate
free of regulation better than a fund located in a more traditional financial
market. The lack of regulation can greatly increase the potential for increased
return and reduced investment risk, but only if you qualify and if you know
the other risks that you’re taking. In general, a U.S. citizen or resident alien
may not invest in offshore funds. These funds are for citizens outside of the
United States, residents outside of the United States, and individuals who are
in the United States for less than 180 days a year. In addition, U.S.-based tax-
exempt institutions (such as pensions or foundations; see Chapter 8) and off-
shore corporations may invest in offshore funds.
U.S. investors participate in offshore funds, of course. If you want to join one,
you could set up a corporation in Mauritius and fund it with money that
would then be invested in a hedge fund based in the Cayman Islands. You
could also set up a charitable-remainder trust to create a tax-free vehicle, or
you could buy into the fund through an offshore life-insurance policy.
55
Chapter 3: Not Just a Sleeping Aid: Analyzing SEC Registration

The structures that taxable investors in the United States need to use to
invest in offshore funds are complicated. If you’re interested in going the off-
shore route, you need a lot more advice than you can get from this book.
Because offshore funds have little regulation, you have little recourse if you
run into problems. Your best protection is a good contract and extraordinary
due diligence (see Chapter 18).
Investing in a Fund without Registration
Until Congress passes legislation authorizing the SEC to regulate hedge funds,
you’re investing without a net. That doesn’t mean that all hedge fund man-
agers are shysters or that you have no protections after you enter a fund.
After all, registration had plenty of limits; it didn’t apply to funds with less
than $25 million in assets or fewer than 15 investors, and it didn’t allow
investors to withdraw money for two years.
So, what do you do to protect yourself and to ensure that you receive all pro-
tections coming your way? You read the contract the hedge fund manager
proposes to you, and you do your due diligence; I cover these topics in more
detail in the following sections (and in Chapter 18).
Contracting the manager’s terms
When you buy shares in a hedge fund, you sign a contract agreeing to the
terms that the hedge fund manager has set. You have to certify that you’re an
accredited or qualified investor (see Chapters 1 and 2 for these definitions).
Some of these terms of the contract may be negotiable; negotiations give you
a chance to see if you can change the reporting, withdrawal, or other compo-
nents of the fund’s operations to your liking.
After you sign the contract, it becomes governed by contract law. The con-
tract should give the court jurisdiction in the event of a dispute; the contract
will almost definitely identify a state court, and the hedge fund manager will
prefer to set the state where she lives to reduce her travel costs. (The
investor, of course, will prefer that the jurisdiction be closer to his or her
house.)
The securities industry has long relied on binding arbitration to settle dis-
putes, so don’t be surprised if the hedge-fund contract requires that you
handle any problems that way. In most cases, the contract states that the
56
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org) sets the rules and policies
for the arbitration. Most securities lawyers are familiar with the arbitration
process, but a lawyer who doesn’t specialize in the investment business may
not be. Should you need to take a case to arbitration, do yourself a favor and
find a lawyer who has experience (see the section “First thing we do, we hire
the lawyers” earlier in this chapter); many believe that players in the securi-
ties business prefer arbitration because it’s so often favorable to the indus-
try, not the investor.
Covering yourself with due diligence
Is your hedge fund manager who she says she is? What about the company
that issued the bonds she wants to invest in? It’s on you to find out — espe-
cially if you don’t have the backing of registration with the SEC to rely on for
protections.
Registration and contract law are no match for the investor who heads off
problems by checking out the players. Due diligence is the process of verify-
ing the information that you have. (Sometimes people refer to it as “due
dilly,” but I think that’s silly. I’m a snob that way.) Chapter 18 gives you the
information you need to get started, but here’s a quick list you can use with a
little information specific to this chapter:
 Yes, do a Google search, but don’t stop there. Search for information
about the manager and the fund on Lexis-Nexis or another news data-
base.
 Look up the fund manager’s U4 (see the section “Reviewing the registra-
tion process” earlier in this chapter) or get a copy of his résumé, and
then pick up the phone and verify the employment and educational
information you find on it.
 Ask other investors about their experiences with the fund.
 Call the hedge fund’s prime broker, accountant, and lawyer. Be sure to
go through the switchboard at those firms, on the outside chance that
the hedge fund manager gave you the cell-phone number of an accom-
plice who will lie to you.
 Get complete information on the hedge fund’s investment style, cash-
distribution policies, investor-communication policies, fees, and com-
missions. Do you understand them? If not, and even if so, you may want
an experienced lawyer or consultant to review them (see Chapter 17 to
find out more about consultants).

A
n open-end mutual fund, which you probably know about if you’re con-
sidering a hedge fund, continuously offers stock to the public. You find
a fund that interests you through an advertisement, on the Internet, in the
papers, or through a financial advisor; you read the prospectus that the fund
issues; you fill out a form; you write your check; and viola! You’re a mutual-
fund shareholder. A hedge fund is nothing like that. When you enter into a
hedge fund, you join a private-investment partnership.
If you want to enter the hedge-fund world, you have to be prepared to jump
through some hoops. Few hedge funds have Web sites, let alone toll-free num-
bers you can call to contact helpful, licensed sales representatives. You can’t
call a hedge fund to place an order like you can with a mutual fund. In fact,
you can’t get into many funds, even if you’re an accredited investor (one with
$200,000 in annual income [$300,000 with a spouse] or a net worth of $1 mil-
lion; see Chapter 2). Hedge fund managers may not want to take more money
than they can handle, given the strategies that they follow (for more informa-
tion on dealing with managers, see Chapters 1 and 2). And, as hedge funds
are unregistered, they may not be able to increase their asset base or their
investor headcount without running afoul of Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) requirements (I discuss these requirements in great detail
in Chapter 3).
Still, hedge funds need investors as much as investors need hedge funds.
They have no job if they have no money to run! In this chapter, I tell you what
you need to know to enter this private world.

You don’t need a broker to buy into a hedge fund, and you don’t need a
broker to buy into a mutual fund, but a broker sometimes helps the process.
For more on finding consultants, see Chapter 17, and read on!
Using Consultants and Brokers
If you can’t call up a hedge fund manager, how do you know that he’s out
there? The key is networking. Hedge fund managers often work with consul-
tants who track hedge-fund performance and help market the funds. The
hedge funds place their trades through prime brokers — brokerage firms that
handle most of their trades and back-office work. Many of these brokerage
firms have sales reps who work with high-net-worth individuals, pension
funds, and endowment funds. Some prime brokers encourage communication
by holding conferences each year to bring their hedge fund clients and
prospective investors together. (You can find more about consultants in
Chapter 17.)
A hedge fund manager won’t take your investment unless he’s certain 
that you’re an accredited investor — you have a yearly income of $200,000
($300,000 with a spouse) or $1,000,000 in assets. Otherwise, he’s breaking the
law. You may not be asked to prove it, but you will be asked to sign a state-
ment attesting to your accredited status.
Your mission is to find appropriate hedge funds that are open to taking your
investment. If you’re interested in buying into a hedge fund, you should start
by talking to your financial advisor. If you work at a pension or endowment,
you probably deal with consultants who can point you in the right direction.
If you’re an accredited individual investor, your broker, lawyer, or accountant
may be able to put you in touch with brokers or consultants who can find
hedge funds for you.
However, hedge-fund investing is very much a private club. If you don’t know
anyone in the hedge-fund world but want to invest, your best bet is to work
with a broker at a very large, brand-name brokerage firm. Such firms are
likely to serve as prime brokers to hedge funds, and they may put on confer-
ences for prospective hedge fund investors.
Some large brokers are more likely than others to have connections to hedge
funds. When using a broker to find a hedge fund, you should inquire about
the relationship between the hedge fund and the broker. Specifically, what
financial arrangements are in place?
60
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

Keep in mind that brokerage-firm employees have to follow strict rules when
marketing hedge funds. The National Association of Securities Dealers, which
regulates brokerage firms, says that its member firms must adhere to the 
following:
 Provide balanced disclosure of the different funds under consideration
 Perform a reasonable determination of the investor’s suitability
 Provide supervision for anyone in the firm selling hedge funds
 Train staffers in the risks, features, and suitability of hedge funds
If your broker isn’t providing you with these services, go elsewhere.
Marketing to and for Hedge 
Fund Managers
Most hedge funds are too small to have dedicated marketing staffers. Instead,
funds rely on personal connections, relationships their prime brokers have,
and consultants to find the money they put in their funds. In some special
cases, the manager’s reputation within the industry may be enough to bring
in money.
If Joe Dokes the trader goes out on his own after making money for his old
investment employer, people who witnessed his abilities will want to invest
with him. Joe will probably talk to any accredited investors among his friends
and family to see if they’re interested in investing. At that point, he’ll talk to
his prime broker, which may know of interested investors. The brokerage
may arrange for a road show, during which Joe meets with potential investors
all over the country (or even the world). Joe will probably also meet with the
consultants who advise hedge fund investors. (Chapter 17 has more informa-
tion about the roles consultants play.)
These points are where you come in. You need to determine what types of
hedge funds will help you meet your investment objectives (I cover styles in
Part III) and then start asking contacts in the business about funds in those
categories that are open to new investors. The process is basically old-
fashioned networking. If someone known to a fund introduces you, even
through a few degrees of separation — and if the introducer can vouch for
your accredited status (see Chapter 2) — you’ll find that doors open quickly.
61
Chapter 4: How to Buy into a Hedge Fund

You may not want to invest in a fund’s start-up phase, opting instead to track the
initial performance of the fund. Later on, if the fund manager starts another fund,
expands the current fund, or needs someone to buy out a current investor’s
stake, he’ll know whom to turn to.
Because funds can’t market to non-accredited investors (see Chapter 2),
they’re reluctant to do anything that may be construed as an advertisement.
Most funds have no Web sites, and some don’t even put their phone numbers
in the phonebook.
When you obtain a meeting with the manager (a broker or your consultant
may set up the meeting), you get a chance to review legal forms that discuss
the fund, which may include an offering circular, private placement memoran-
dum, or Securities and Exchange Commission Form ADV that describes who
the manager is and what the fund strategy involves. (Chapter 3 gives you a
description of these documents.) At that point, you’ll most likely have a
chance to meet with the manager to find out more about the investment style
and whether the fund is a good fit for you.
No matter who recommends the hedge fund, how prosperous the manager
looks, or how logical the investment strategy seems, don’t invest until you
check out the fund manager (Chapter 18 provides more information on what
to look for). This process is called due diligence, and it’s a key step in buying
into a hedge fund.
Hedge funds often want to control the amount of money under management,
so if the fund has more interested investors than it can handle, the fund man-
ager can choose among them. A prospective investor with less experience or
greater liquidity needs may lose out to a person who has invested in hedge
funds before and who doesn’t foresee a need to make withdrawals.
Most managers also prefer more experienced investors because their level 
of patience may be higher, making them less likely to withdraw money if the
funds hit some rough patches.
Investor, Come on Down: Pricing Funds
When you buy into a hedge fund or cash out your shares, you need to know
what the shares are worth. When a fund forms, setting the price is simple: The
total value of the fund is the total value of the cash put into it. If the fund dis-
bands, setting the prices is also simple: The hedge fund manager sells all the
securities, pays all the bills, and distributes the remainder proportionately.
62
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

You own a percentage of the partnership that translates into your holding.
This is a better way to describe a hedge-fund holding than “holding shares.”
If a stake in the fund is added or withdrawn, by the investor or the fund 
manager, at any time between when the fund forms and when it’s liquidated,
calculating the value of each investor’s share is much tougher. Even if the
investor isn’t selling, she may have other reasons for needing the value of the
hedge-fund investment. If the investor is a pension plan, for example, the plan
must report the value of the assets in its hedge-fund investments to the
plan’s sponsor, its trustees, and its beneficiaries on a regular basis.
And, of course, you need to know what the shares are worth to calculate per-
formance (see Chapter 14 for more information on performance calculation). In
this section, I cover net asset value calculation, including dealing with illiquid
securities. With the use of these tools, you’ll have a sense of how the fund
comes up with the value of your investment.
Prices are all over the place. Some funds report values to consultants annu-
ally or quarterly, but many don’t. Minimum investments are all over the
place, too. Some funds will take $25,000 investments, and others insist on 
$10 million.
Calculating net asset value
Hedge funds are priced on their net asset value. Also called book value, net
asset value is the total of all the fund’s assets minus all the fund’s liabilities.
Sounds simple, right? Well, here’s one catch: finding the value for all the
fund’s securities, calculated at the end of each trading day. If a fund invests
entirely in one market and one type of investment, the pricing is straightfor-
ward — the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closes at 4:00 p.m. ET, so if all
your investments trade there, you simply price at the close. But in a global
market, who decides when the trading day ends? What if you also have
futures (financial contracts that trade on a different exchange)?
Here are some global considerations that you must deal with:
 The Chicago Board of Trade’s Dow Jones futures contracts trade on the
floor of that exchange until 4:15 p.m. ET.
 The London Stock Exchange closes at 10:30 a.m. ET, but if a big-news
event involving a listed company occurs, trading takes place over-the-
counter (between buyers and sellers, using electronic networks rather
63
Chapter 4: How to Buy into a Hedge Fund

than the floor of the exchange) until the LSE opens again at 4:30 a.m. ET
the next morning.
 The Tokyo Stock Exchange takes an hour-and-a-half break from trading
at lunchtime, but no one in New York knows because they’re asleep.
Many hedge funds rely heavily on over-the-counter trading to take advantage
of short-term discrepancies in prices. A large fund that does business in
many markets around the world may have staffers working around the clock.
If assets are in constant motion, when does the clock stop so you can calcu-
late net asset value?
So, as simple as the concept of net asset value may seem, be sure to ask the
fund manager when and how the fund calculates the value. It should be
spelled out in the contracts that you sign when you enter the fund. Table 4-1
shows you how the hour of the pricing affects the fund’s value that day. For
simplicity, this table covers the total U.S. dollar value of each security. For
the London stock, it tracks how the price changes in after-hours trading.

If you calculate the net asset value when the New York Stock exchange closes,
it would be $2,298. Calculate it at 5:00 p.m. — the end of the business day in
New York — and the price is $2,286. Wait until midnight and the price is $2,266.
If you add the values at the closing time for each market, the price is the sum of
the price at each market’s close (ignoring the after-market trading):
$986 + $1,054 – $802 + $900 = $2,138

Chapter 4: How to Buy into a Hedge Fund

No calculation method is inherently better; the key is that the method is dis-
closed and applied consistently.
Valuing illiquid securities
Because hedge funds can limit how often clients withdraw money (see Chapter 7),
and because they tend to take a broad view of possible investments, they
often put money in illiquid securities — investments that don’t trade very
often and are difficult to sell on short notice.
Academic theory says that the market price is the correct price for an asset,
but this statement assumes that markets are perfectly efficient. One require-
ment for an efficient market is perfect liquidity, in which buying or selling 
has no effect on the price. The price in the market is the correct price. (See
Chapter 6 for more on this topic.)
In reality, supply and demand drive markets, so short-term buying and selling
can have an enormous impact on prices. If an asset trades all the time, the
value is widely known. It’s easy to know what a share of Microsoft stock is
worth because millions of shares are bought and sold every day, for example.
If an asset doesn’t trade, you have no observable, unbiased market indicator
of what the true price should be. Think about a house. My house isn’t exactly
like my neighbor’s house. They were built at the same time, but my neighbor
added a bathroom, and I installed custom bookcases. When the time comes
to sell, there may not be a ready buyer for either of our houses. If I have to
sell quickly, I may take the first offer that comes my way, even if it’s low. If my
neighbor puts her house on the market at the same time but doesn’t need to
move right away, she can hold out for a higher price. Houses are just one
example of an illiquid, tough-to-price asset.
Hedge funds have many techniques to use to assign values to illiquid securities:
 Net present value: The discounted value of all the expected cash flows.
 Black-Scholes: A complicated mathematical model used to find the value
of an option.
 Relative valuation: Basing the security’s price on a similar security that
trades frequently.
I discuss different valuation methods in Chapter 5.
If a hedge fund you’re interested in invests in illiquid securities, find out what
its policy for valuation is. And know that you take on some risk if the fund
buys a lot of these assets — the price assigned to the fund may not hold when
the illiquid securities have to be sold (quite a catchy rhyme, don’t you think?).
66
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

Managing side pockets
A side pocket in a hedge fund is a group of securities held by only some of the
fund’s investors. And unlike side pockets in jeans, they don’t make your hips
look larger.
Hedge funds set up side pockets — also called designated investments or spe-
cial investments — for two main reasons:
 To hold illiquid securities (see the previous section) away from money
that investors can redeem. For example, the fund may allow investors
to pull money out of the main part of the fund once per quarter, but it
may decide that investors can redeem funds in the side pocket only
once every two years. Likewise, new fund investors can’t enter into the
side pocket so that the valuation of those investments doesn’t become
an issue for them. If you invest in a fund that’s just starting out, part of
your investment may be held in a side pocket
 To allow certain fund investors access to securities that other
investors may not have. The fund may provide performance entice-
ments or other special benefits that attract specific investors. A fund
may also set up a side pocket to meet the needs of a large institutional
investor that can put a great deal of money into the fund. For example,
some people who work in the securities business may not be able to
invest in Initial Public Offerings of stock, so they may invest in a side
pocket that does not buy these securities. An endowment with a long
time horizon may be interested in illiquid securities, so they fund may
have a side pocket just for them to hold these securities.
Side pockets are priced separately from the rest of the fund. Because they’re
often set up just to hold illiquid investments, their price may be more uncertain.
Purchasing Your Stake in the Fund
After a hedge fund investor and a hedge fund manager decide to work
together after setting up interviews through brokers or other connections
and determining the price of your investment (see the previous sections of
this chapter), the next stage in the process starts: the purchase. The
investors (lucky you!) and the manager have tons of forms to fill out, and, of
course, you have to transfer some money before you can turn a large profit.
This section covers those logistics.
67
Chapter 4: How to Buy into a Hedge Fund

Fulfilling paperwork requirements
Besides the initial partnership-agreement forms, you have other forms to fill
out and provide and other obligations to meet. The U.S. Treasury Department’s
Financial Crimes Informant Network (www.fincen.gov), which investigates
money laundering, requires financial institutions to have enforcement proce-
dures in place to verify that new investments aren’t made from ill-gotten funds.
The hedge fund’s staff must verify that they know who the investors in the
fund are and where their money came from, so you have to provide the fol-
lowing when you open a hedge-fund account:
 Name
 Date of birth
 Street address
 Place of business
 Social Security number or taxpayer identification number
 Copies of financial statements from banks, brokerages, and other
accounts showing that you’re accredited and that you have enough
money to meet the initial investment
If you want to open an individual account, you should also be prepared to
provide your driver’s license and passport. If you want to open an institu-
tional account, you have to provide certified articles of incorporation, a 
government-issued business license, or a trust instrument.
Working with brokers
After you sign all the forms and do all the hand-shaking (not the fraternity
kind, probably), you can deposit your cash. The money you put up goes to
the fund’s prime broker, which holds it in escrow until the fund is ready to
add new money. To minimize the cash-flow effects on investment returns, the
fund may add money only once a month, once a quarter, or once a year (see
Chapter 2 for more information on how hedge funds manage cash flows).
If you already have an account for your other investments at the same firm as
the fund’s prime brokerage, you’ll have an easy transfer. If your money comes
from a bank or another brokerage firm, you may be required to obtain signa-
ture guarantees before you can transfer the funds. The brokerage or bank will
probably send the money electronically, although you may be required to
send a certified or cashier’s check, which you can obtain through your bank.
(In the United States, most brokerage and bank functions are separated. In
other parts of the world, the same institution may handle both services.)
68
Part I: What is a Hedge Fund, Anyway? 

After you send your money to the brokerage, you can begin monitoring your
fund’s ride in the markets. Whether it behaves like a raft through class-five
whitewater rapids or a ship on a sail through quiet seas, you won’t get a visit
from Julie the Adventure Director. Instead, the taxman may come along. (For
more on tax considerations for hedge fund investors, see Chapter 8.)
Reporting to the taxman
On top of the identity paperwork you fill out at the beginning of the purchas-
ing process (see the section “Fulfilling paperwork requirements”), you have
forms to fill out for tax reporting down the road. IRS Form W9, for example,
keeps your taxpayer information on record.
Each year, you’ll receive a K-1 form from the fund, which reports your share of
the hedge fund’s profits. (The hedge fund itself files form 1065 with the IRS.)
As a partner, you need to report your share of the fund’s earnings to the IRS,
even if you haven’t received any cash. This is a different reporting structure
from most other forms of investment income, which are usually reported on
1099 forms and handled through schedule B and schedule D of IRS Form 1040.
The fund itself doesn’t pay the taxes — you do.
Signing Your Name on the Bottom Line
When you buy into a hedge fund, you buy shares in an investment partner-
ship. This purchase carries some specific contractual obligations that both
parties — you, the investor who purchases as the limited partner, and the
hedge fund’s general partners — have to meet. The following sections give
you some background, but I suggest also calling a lawyer before you commit
$5 million of your hard-earned money by signing a contract. A lawyer may be
able to negotiate changes on different provisions, like withdrawal procedures
or disclosure levels, to get them working in your favor.
Drawing up the contract
When you enter into a hedge fund, the fund manager presents you with a con-
tract drawn up by the fund’s law firm (make sure any fund you choose has a
law firm and a brokerage firm). The contract will be more or less standard,
but it will be written to favor the general partners’ interests.
The fund manager may refer to the contract as a partnership agreement, a sub-
scription agreement, or a private-placement memorandum; however, its legal
69
Chapter 4: How to Buy into a Hedge Fund

status as a contract is similar, no matter the document’s title. Some contracts
can be so sided to the managers that they’ll be open to doing anything they
want with the money, investment-wise. I strongly advise you to have a lawyer
with you when going over the contract.
Addressing typical contract provisions
The hedge fund contract sets forth many pieces of information you need 
to know:
 The fund’s general partners
 The fund’s status with regulators (turn to Chapter 3 for more informa-
tion on regulation)
 The fees that the fund charges and how it calculates them
 The fund’s limits on withdrawals
The contract may also discuss the fund’s investment strategies, the assets
that the fund will and won’t invest in, and reporting requirements, but it
doesn’t have to.
A partnership agreement also sets forth how the fund will handle any con-
flicts. Most likely, limited partners give up the right to sue; you have to take
disputes to arbitration, which is the norm in the investment business. The
agreement you sign should discuss who will oversee the arbitration and
where it will take place, should a hearing become necessary.
By signing the document, you agree to the terms and certify that you’re an
accredited investor (an investor with a net worth of $1 million and an annual
income of $200,000 [$300,000 with a spouse]; see Chapter 2 for more).
Finding room for negotiation
When you get the contract — either in person, electronically, or in the mail —
your first impulse will be to mark every clause you don’t like and then go to the
fund’s general partners and ask for changes. In most cases, you’ll get rebuffed.
Hedge funds are popular investments, and many people want to hop on the
bandwagon. Good fund managers can — and do — set their own terms.
But keep this in mind: If the fund you’re interested in is small; if the manager
is relatively new; and if you have plenty of money to commit, you may have
some leverage. You may be able to ask for sales-fee reductions, fewer with-
drawal restrictions, or other changes that meet your needs. In hedge funds,
as in life, it never hurts to ask.

Determining
Whether Hedge
Funds Are Right 
for You

In this part . . .
A
lthough hedge fund managers have more flexibility
than many other money managers when it comes to
generating high returns relative to the amount of risk
taken, a hedge fund isn’t an appropriate investment for
every type of investor. In Part II, you get information 
on how to choose a hedge fund — or any other type of
investment — by doing some asset research, determining
your risk and return preferences, surveying your tax situa-
tion, and considering other special needs that you may
have. With the information here, you can make smarter
decisions about how to manage your money.

Chapter 5
Hedging through Research 
and Asset Selection
In This Chapter
 Exploring basic and alternative asset classes
 Investigating a fund’s fundamental research techniques
 Discovering how a fund applies the research to make money for you
A
hedge fund manager’s job is to survey the world’s markets to find
investments that meet the fund’s risk and return parameters. But how
does the manager actually do it?
The fund manager has to have a system in place for determining what to
invest in and for how long. He looks for opportunities to make money in an
asset that’s going to change in price, and he looks to reduce the risk of the
portfolio. Without discipline, he can’t make good decisions, which makes
your job of evaluating performance impossible. Anyone who invests money
has several available techniques for increasing returns and reducing risk.
Some hedge fund managers simply do better research, and others rely on
technical analysis, short-selling, and leverage to generate the returns that
their clients expect. (I discuss technical analysis later in this chapter, and I
cover short-selling and leverage in Chapter 11.)
This chapter gives you a basic overview of the different financial assets avail-
able and tells you how fund managers may value them. I hope to help you
understand what kinds of assets a hedge fund might invest in. I can’t give you
an easy answer as to how or whether these assets should be used in a hedge
fund, but armed with this information, you can make better investment deci-
sions for yourself and ask better questions of a hedge fund manager, who
wants to make the decisions for you.

First Things First: Examining 
Your Asset Options
You can’t invest wisely unless you know what you’re investing in. If you don’t
understand what a hedge fund manager is talking about when he’s discussing
prospective asset classes or strategies, you’re more likely to make mistakes
with your hard-earned money. On the other end of the spectrum, if you com-
pletely understand the characteristics of different asset classes, you may see
investing alternatives that fit your needs and don’t involve hedge funds at all.
(You don’t have to be a millionaire to take advantage of some of these oppor-
tunities.) Now, for a middle ground. By understanding the asset classes the
hedge funds may focus on, you can make sound investing decisions with
hedge funds.
Most investors should hold a diversified mix of securities in order to get their
optimal risk and return payoff. The exact proportion depends on your needs.
(Chapters 7, 8, and 9 cover the details you need to consider when structuring
your portfolio.) Likewise, hedge fund managers have different targets for risk
and return, and they turn to different assets in order to meet their targets.
They spend time doing their research, and you should do the same (see the
section “Kicking the Tires: Fundamental Research” later in this chapter).
A hedge fund or a group of hedge funds may use the assets you see here in
many different ways. Hedge fund managers often use traditional assets in
non-traditional ways, for example, so no hard and fast rules are there to rely
on. But if you have some basic understanding, you’ll be in a better position to
ask good questions. The chapters of Part III cover some of the investment
strategies and styles that hedge funds use. Consider this chapter to be a 
companion.
In practice, “asset” and “security” are synonyms, and derivatives are consid-
ered to be a type of asset. But to be precise, these three aren’t the same. An
asset is a physical item — examples include a company, a house, gold bullion,
or a loan. A security is a contract that gives someone the right of ownership of
an asset — a share of stock, a bond, or a promissory note, for example. A
derivative is a contract that draws its value from the price of a security.
74
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

Sticking to basics: Traditional 
asset classes
Although many hedge funds pursue esoteric strategies and exotic assets, 
all funds have some investment positions in ordinary investment classes.
Traditional assets can be parts of profitable trades, so don’t assume that a
hedge fund manager who steers clear of swaps traded on the Zimbabwe
Stock Exchange is a bad fund manager.
Just because a hedge fund invests in securities that you’ve heard of doesn’t
mean it isn’t taking on risk. Some hedge funds buy very ordinary and safe secu-
rities, such as U.S. government bonds, but they goose up the returns — and the
risk — by using borrowed money to finance almost the entire position.
The following sections give you a roundup of the usual suspects used to
manage risk and return in hedge funds. You may be surprised that they don’t
look much different from what you would see in any investment portfolio.
Taking stock in stocks
A stock (also called an equity) is a security that represents a fractional inter-
est in the ownership of a company. Buy one share of Microsoft, and you
become an owner of the company, just as Bill Gates is, for example. He owns
a much larger share of the total business, obviously, but you both have a
stake. Stockholders elect a board of directors to represent their interests in
how the company manages itself. Each share represents a vote, so good luck
getting Bill Gates kicked off the Microsoft board! Hedge fund managers often
buy and sell stocks in order to meet their investment objectives.
A share of stock has limited liability, which means that you can lose your
entire investment, but no more than that. If the company files for bankruptcy,
creditors can’t come after shareholders for the money that the company
owes them.
Some companies pay their shareholders a dividend, which is a small cash
payment made out of firm profits. In fiscal year 2005, for example, Microsoft
paid each shareholder a dividend of $0.36 per share, paid out at a rate of
$0.09 each quarter. The ratio of the dividend to the stock price is called the
yield.
Any bonds today?
A bond is a loan that hedge fund managers often invest in to meet their invest-
ment objectives. Hedge fund managers invest in many different types of bonds
at different times; it all depends on the fund’s investment objectives, what tech-
niques the fund uses, and the prices in the market at any given time.
75
Chapter 5: Hedging through Research and Asset Selection

A company or a government issues a bond in order to raise money to cover
expenses or investments that can’t be funded out of current income or sav-
ings. In other words, companies and governments borrow money for the
same reasons that individuals do. The bond issuing process goes as follows:
1. The bond buyer gives the bond issuer money.
2. The bond issuer promises to pay interest on a regular basis.
3. The bond issuer then repays the money borrowed — the principal —
on a predetermined date, known as the maturity.
Bonds generally have a maturity of more than 10 years. In the realm of gov-
ernment bonds, short-term bonds are referred to as notes, and bonds that
mature within a year of issuance are referred to as bills. Among business
issues, short-term bonds are often called commercial paper. The interest 
payments on a bond are called coupons.
Over the years, enterprising financiers realized that while some investors
needed regular payments, others wanted to receive single sums at a future
date, so they separated the coupons from the principal. The issuer sells the
principal payment, known as a zero-coupon bond, to one investor, and sells
the coupons, called strips, to another investor. A borrower makes the pay-
ments just like with a regular bond. (Regular bonds, by the way, are some-
times called “plain vanilla.”)
A borrower who wants to make a series of payments with no lump-sum prin-
cipal repayment seeks an amortizing bond to return principal and interest on
a regular basis. If you think about a typical mortgage, the borrower makes a
regular payment of both principal and interest. This way, the amount owed
gets smaller over time so that the borrower doesn’t have to come up with a
large principal repayment at maturity.
76
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 
Coupon clippers
If you look on a bulletin board in a coffee shop
or other community space, you’ll probably see
a “car for sale” or “apartment for rent” sign
with little information slips cut into the bottom.
If you’re interested, you can rip off a slip and
contact the advertiser later. Bonds used to
employ the same strategy. The bond buyer
would receive one large certificate good for the
principal, with many smaller certificates, called
coupons, attached. When a payment was due,
the owner would cut off the matching coupon
and deposit it in the bank. Some old novels refer
to rich people as “coupon clippers,” meaning
that their sole labor in life is to cut out their bond
coupons and cash them in.
Nowadays, you can handle bond payments
electronically, so you now reserve the coupon-
clipper label for bargain hunters looking for an
extra $0.50 off a jar of peanut butter.

Other borrowers may prefer to make single payments at maturity, so they
seek out discount bonds. The purchase price is the principal reduced by the
amount of interest that otherwise needs to be paid. In other words, if a dis-
count bond paid 10 percent interest and was due in a year, it would sell for
$909 today. The buyer would receive no interest payments; instead, he would
get a check for $1,000 in a year.
If a company goes bankrupt, the bondholders get paid before the sharehold-
ers. In some bankruptcies, the bondholders take over the business, leaving
the current shareholders with nothing.
Surveying cash and equivalents
Cash is king, as they say. Hedge fund managers have money readily available
to purchase securities for the portfolio or to meet customer redemptions. 
For the most part, the interest rate on cash is very low, so hedge funds try to
keep as little cash on hand as possible. However, they do look for some cash
and cash-equivalent investments that can pay off handsomely.
One way that hedge fund managers make money from their cash holdings is
by making short-term loans. Collectively known as money market securities or
cash equivalents, these loans are expected to mature within 30 days or even
overnight.
For example, a multinational corporation may need to borrow money for one
day to meet payroll. It issues what’s called a repurchase agreement: It borrows
the money for one night by selling the hedge fund a bond and then pays the
money back by repurchasing it for a slightly higher price the next day. The
risk for the hedge fund is very low; the interest rate is low, too, but it’s higher
than if the money just sat around.
Other forms of money-market securities include the following:
 Long-term bonds that are about to mature (say, a bond issued 15 years
ago that matures next week)
 Uninsured bank CDs
 Government securities that will mature within 90 days
The first key decision a manager makes is what currency to keep the cash 
in. Currency fluctuates rapidly, which makes even recent stories sound like
ancient history. (Cue the storytelling music!) For example, once upon a time,
a few years back, the dollar was very strong relative to the euro. In 2002, I
sent everyone in my family sweaters and rugby shirts from Ireland and Scot-
land as their Christmas presents. I purchased them online and sent them to
the United States. Even figuring in the shipping costs, the prices were better
77
Chapter 5: Hedging through Research and Asset Selection

than I could’ve received in the United States. But about a year later, when we
took a family vacation to Ireland, the dollar dropped dramatically. In just 15
months, the euro’s value increased 25 percent. Someone who purchased euros
in late 2002 and waited until early 2004 to bring them out of the pocketbook
would’ve seen a huge profit (see Figure 5-1).
Going for some flavor: Alternative assets
You may think that geeks armed with MBAs and HP12C calculators dominate
the world of finance, but the field is filled with creative people who break the
mold. Investment bankers are slicing and dicing streams of cash flow into all
kinds of new and nontraditional assets that meet specific needs for people
who need money and people who have money to invest. Hedge fund man-
agers, sniffing out opportunities to meet their investment objectives, often
turn to the alternative assets we outline in the following subsections.
In popular usage, an alternative investment is anything other than stocks,
bonds, or cash (see the previous subsections in this chapter). Hedge funds
themselves are often considered to be an alternative investment class, but
they shouldn’t be. A hedge fund is an investment vehicle. Because of their
light regulations and limits on withdrawals, hedge funds have more freedom

Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

to invest in alternative asset classes. They may be structured with a risk pro-
file that’s completely different from a traditional asset, but they’re not in and
of themselves alternative assets.
Real estate
Real estate isn’t always considered an investment. In most cases, it’s a store
of value, which is an excellent hedge against inflation. In other words, over
the long run, you expect the price to increase by inflation and not much more.
This expectation is particularly appropriate for raw land and, believe it or
not, single-family houses.
Yes, I know, you must think I’m on something, because your grandmother
bought her house for $20,000 in 1955 and sold it for $200,000 in 2005. But on 
a compound basis, she earned 4.7 percent per year. She lived rent-free, but 
she had to take care of ongoing maintenance and repairs. Not to mention that
$20,000, adjusted for inflation, was the equivalent of $142,000 in 2005 dollars,
making her real, after-inflation return less than 1 percent per year. That return
is about what you’d expect from a store of value, not from an investment.
But real estate can be an investment, too. An office or apartment building
generates a steady flow of rental income in addition to the stored value of the
land. Agricultural real estate, including timberland, generates a steady flow of
income from the sale of the commodities produced. Real estate that contains
minerals generates profits when the minerals are extracted and sold.
Raw land may increase in value if demand for it changes. Take the following
as examples of this demand-motivated value increase:
 A developer may convert an abandoned manufacturing building to resi-
dential loft condominiums, if a market’s taste shifts that way.
 If people want to move to the far reaches of an urban area, farmland may
become more valuable when converted to a residential subdivision.
 Young families may refuse to consider certain city neighborhoods and
then change their minds when the public schools improve.
 A sleepy farm community may take on a completely different character
when engineering graduates from a nearby university start semiconduc-
tor companies in their garages.
Hedge funds rarely purchase raw land for investment purposes, but they may
provide lending to real-estate investors, help finance construction projects, or
take shares in mineral projects (see the following section for more informa-
tion). It’s entirely possible that a hedge fund you invest in will put your money
into real estate. Now that you know a little more about that asset, you’re in a
better position to understand and evaluate the hedge fund manager’s strategy
and results (see Chapter 14 for more on performance evaluation).

Commodities
Commodities are basic, interchangeable goods sold in bulk and used to make
other goods. Examples include oil, gold, wheat, and lumber. A hedge fund
probably won’t buy commodities outright, but it may take a stake in them in
one of a few different manners:
 By purchasing real estate that generates income from commodities pro-
duced, like timberland or agricultural holdings (see the previous section)
 Through futures contracts, which change in price with the underlying
commodities (see the upcoming section “Betting your future on futures”)
 By managing its stock investments based on the exposure of the com-
pany issuing the stock to different commodity trends
Commodities are popular as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty. In gen-
eral, commodity prices tend to increase at the same rate as prices in the
overall economy, so they maintain their real (inflation-adjusted) value. They
may also be susceptible to short-term changes in supply and demand. A cold
winter increases demand for oil, for example, a dry summer reduces produc-
tion of wheat, and a civil war may disrupt access to platinum mines. If you
invest in a hedge fund that works with commodities, the info here should
help you understand why the value of your investment will fluctuate.
Venture capital
Great entrepreneurs often have fabulous ideas held captive by thin wallets. To
fund their business ideas, they look for investors willing to take great risks in
hopes of high returns. Heady investors provided the start-up capital for busi-
ness like Google, Yahoo!, and America Online — think of how much money
they made for getting in on the ground floor! But for every success story, you
have the sad tales of companies that went under before they even got started.
Many hedge funds are in the business of taking on high risk in exchange 
for potential high returns, so venture capital fits neatly. Some hedge funds
become partners in venture capital firms (private partnerships that often
operate like hedge funds), and others seek out promising new businesses to
invest in directly. (See Chapter 12 for more on venture capital.)
Derivatives
Derivatives are financial contracts that draw their value from the value of an
underlying asset, security, or index. For example, an S&P 500 futures contract
gives the buyer a cash payment based on the price of the S&P 500 index
(adjusted for interest rates) on the day that the contract expires. The con-
tract’s value, therefore, depends on where the index is trading — not the
index itself, but the value derived from the price of the index.
80
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

Hedge funds often use derivatives to manage risk. By selling an S&P 500
future, for example, a fund can effectively sell off its exposure to the stock
market. This action helps the fund maintain its market-neutral position. Other
hedge funds use derivatives to increase return or reduce other forms of risk,
such as interest rate or currency risk. A handful of funds invest only in deriv-
atives. (You can discover more about risk and return in Chapter 6.)
Some hedge funds use futures contracts to speculate — to make bets that the
price of the underlying assets will go up or down in price. Futures contracts are
highly liquid — they’re easy to trade — which makes them attractive for a
hedge fund that wants to take a very short-term position in an asset class.
Opting for an option play
An option is a contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation,
to buy or sell the underlying asset at an agreed-upon price at an agreed-upon
date in the future. An option that gives you the right to buy is a call, and an
option that gives you the right to sell is a put. A call is most valuable if the
stock price is going up, whereas a put has more value if the stock price is
going down. Here’s a quick sentence to help you remember the difference:
You call up your friend to put down your enemy.
For example, a call named MSFT 2006 Mar 22.50 gives you the right to buy
Microsoft at $22.50 per share at the expiration date of mid-March, 2006.
(Note: Traders refer to Microsoft as “Mr. Softy” because MSFT is Microsoft’s
trading symbol and because traders have a sense of humor.) If Microsoft is
trading above $22.50, you can exercise your option and make a quick profit. If
Microsoft is selling below $22.50, you can buy the stock cheaper in the open
market, so the option would be worthless.
Hedge funds sometimes use options to manage risk or to profit from price
changes.
You can find great information on options, including online tutorials, at the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Web site, www.cboe.com.
Warrants and convertible bonds
A warrant is similar to an option (see the previous section), but a company
issues it instead of it being sold on an organized exchange. It gives the holder
the right to buy more stock in the company at an agreed-upon price in the
future. Company-issued employee stock options are more like warrants than
exchange-traded stock options. Related to the warrant is the convertible bond,
which is debt issued by the company. The company pays interest on the bond,
and the bondholder has the right to exchange it for stock. Which option the
holder should exercise depends on interest rates and the stock price.
81
Chapter 5: Hedging through Research and Asset Selection

Hedge funds sometimes use warrants and convertible bonds to manage risk
or to profit from price changes.
Betting your future on futures
A futures contract attaches the obligation to buy a set quantity of the underly-
ing asset at set price and at a set future date. Futures started in the agricul-
tural industry because they allowed farmers and food processors to lock in
their prices early in the growing season, reducing the amount of uncertainty
in their businesses. Futures have now been applied to many different assets,
ranging from pork bellies (which really do trade; manufacturers use them to
make bacon) to currency values. A simple example is a lock-in home-mortgage
rate; the borrower knows the rate that the mortgage company will apply
before it closes the sale and finalizes the loan.
Most futures contracts are closed out with cash before the settlement date.
Financial contracts — futures on currencies, interest rates, or market index
values — can be closed out only with cash. Commodity contracts may be set-
tled with the physical items, but almost all get settled with cash.
Futures contracts are useful for hedge fund managers who want to lock in
prices. They also give managers exposure to commodity prices without
having to handle the actual assets. After all, the average financial wizard
doesn’t want to care for live cattle, operate grain silos, or keep freezers full 
of pork bellies! (Most futures that investors trade are interest rates, used by
people who need to manage interest-rate risk and people who hope to profit
from it. Pork bellies are much less common, but they’re a lot more fun to talk
about!)
Forwards (not backwards!)
With a forward contract, an investor buys a currency, commodity, or other
asset now at the market price, but the delivery doesn’t take place until an
agreed-upon future time. This strategy allows an investor to lock in the cur-
rent price. In many cases, a hedge fund manager uses forward contracts to
cover a futures contract — the manager locks in the current price in hopes
that the future value is different, creating a profit on the difference. The differ-
ence is known as the spread.
Forward contracts are generally customized and arranged as private transac-
tions. Futures, by contrast, actively trade on organized exchanges such as the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (www.cme.com) and the London International
Financial Futures Exchange.
82
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

Swaps
A swap is an exchange of one cash flow for another. For example, say a com-
pany has issued bonds that pay interest in U.S. dollars. However, it decides to
incur expenses in Japanese yen to offset profits that it makes in Japan. So, the
company finds another company making payments in yen that would rather
be making payments in dollars, and they swap their payments. As a result,
each company can better manage its internal currency risk.
In many cases, one or both parties in the transaction are banks or financial
services firms — like hedge funds. The fund looks to profit on the difference
between the different currencies, different interest-rate structures, or differ-
ent payment times.
Swaps are customized contracts arranged through banks or brokerage firms;
they aren’t traded on an organized exchange.
Custom products and private deals
We often think of securities trading as people in funny jackets running around
and waving their hands like crazy on the floor of an exchange. And this still
happens; however, most trading takes place over the counter. Traders for
hedge funds, banks, brokerage firms, and mutual funds get on the phone or
send electronic messages to each other to buy and sell securities.
Many kinds of securities trade seldom, if at all. These securities are often pri-
vately negotiated deals between a person who needs money and a person(s)
(or a firm) who has it. A lottery winner, for example, may want to exchange
his annual payments from the state for a single lump sum. He finds an
investor who’s looking for a regular income, and the two will cut a deal.
83
Chapter 5: Hedging through Research and Asset Selection
Visiting the center of the financial universe
If you ever get to visit an exchange, you should,
because the energy is fantastic. Many
exchanges have education and visitors’ cen-
ters, and some have galleries where the curi-
ous can catch the trading action. Should you
ever be offered a visit to the floor of an
exchange, jump on it! Very rarely, an exchange
trader or employee will be allowed to show a
guest around. You may have to meet a dress
code and go through tight security, but the
experience is worth it. I’ve been on the floor of
the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago
Board Options Exchange; I’ve watched from the
galleries at the Chicago Board of Trade, the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, and the London Stock
Exchange; and I’ve loved every minute of it!

Hedge funds often participate in private transactions and offbeat investments
so they can meet their desired risk and return characteristics better than they
can with readily traded securities. Contract law governs private transactions;
only rarely does the Securities and Exchange Commission have any say in
them. In this section, I discuss a few such private transactions, like mezzanine
financing and payment-in-kind bonds, but you may come across many others.
Mezzanine financing
Mezzanine financing is a combination of debt and equity used to support a
company until it can go to the public markets. The debt and equity may be
used as late-stage venture capital, when the new business isn’t quite ready to
sell its stock to the public, or it can go toward financing an acquisition. The
lenders of the financing don’t get paid until the company settles all other
debts, making the financing almost like equity in that mezzanine lenders 
can lose everything if the company goes bankrupt.
Payment-in-kind bonds
Distressed companies, or companies in financial trouble, often issue payment-
in-kind bonds. Instead of paying interest on its debt, the company gives the
investors that own its bonds, known as bondholders, other bonds or securi-
ties, which creates many interesting trading opportunities. For example, a
hedge fund manager may notice that the price of a payment-in-kind bond
doesn’t fully reflect the value of the bonds that the company will pay out in
place of interest. Hedge funds like these opportunities.
Tranches
Bonds are often issued in several classes, known as tranches. (“Tranche” is
the French word for slice; in essence, a security is sliced up into smaller secu-
rities when it’s issued in tranches.) Each tranche may have a different inter-
est rate and payment term. For example, one tranche may pay interest only
after the first three years. Another may be a zero-coupon bond, which helps 
a company meet unique cash-flow needs. Tranches are often designed with
the buyer’s needs in mind as well. A hedge fund or other bond buyer may be
looking for a structure that fits in with its overall portfolio construction, and
a unique tranche may be a good fit.
Bonds issued in tranches aren’t plain vanilla bonds (see the section “Any
bonds today?”), and the design of some tranches is often negotiated with the
buyers, which is why I include them in this section.
Viaticals
A viatical is a life-insurance policy purchased from the insured as an invest-
ment. Many terminally ill people need money now. They have life-insurance
84
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

policies with big benefits, but their policies aren’t helping the sick today. So,
these sick people find investors who are willing to give them money now in
exchange for the death benefits later. Viaticals are enormously risky invest-
ments, because sick people get better and researchers develop new cures all
the time. In the 1980s, many viatical buyers focused on AIDS patients, but new
treatments transformed AIDS into more of a long-term chronic illness, not a
certain death sentence. Some contracts investors expected to pay off in 2
years haven’t paid off almost 20 years later.
Because the time to maturity is unknown, viaticals are difficult to price.
However, some hedge funds are willing to take on that risk, because some
funds have aggressive risk-and-return objectives (see Chapter 6). Viaticals
aren’t common investments, but if you see them in the future, you’ll have a
better sense of what to ask.
Kicking the Tires: Fundamental Research
After you can identify different assets classes and how hedge funds use them,
you need to figure out what they’re worth. If you invest in a hedge fund, the
fund’s manager will do the valuation work. If you’re making investment deci-
sions yourself, you have to bear the burden. My point is that someone has to
have a system for figuring out the price to buy a security and the price to sell
a security.
Fundamental research is the process of answering questions to come up with
a value for securities. Whether an investment is plain vanilla or exotic, the
investor has to know what the investment is worth now, what its outlook is,
and what risks affect its value. To discover this information, the investor
needs a system of analysis. Investors use several different approaches to val-
uation. Most settle on two or three that fit the assets they invest in, their per-
sonalities, and the investment objectives of their funds.
No form of fundamental analysis is the “right way.” People can, and do, debate
which research techniques are best. However, the technique an investor uses
isn’t the most important factor; what’s important is that the investor applies
the technique in a consistent, explainable, and logical manner. The choice of
an analysis method seems to be a function of personality and style as much
as anything.
Fundamental research looks at the assets and cash flows of a business to
determine how much its securities are worth. A fund must ask the following
fundamental questions:
85
Chapter 5: Hedging through Research and Asset Selection

 How fast is the company growing its sales?
 Does it have any great new products?
 Does it have patents that the balance sheet doesn’t reflect?
 Will a change in energy prices affect the company?
Beware the fund manager who does a little bit of everything. Too much jargon,
too many analytical techniques, and too much vague information often mean
that the fund manager’s past performance is more due to luck than skill. With-
out having a good system in place for doing research, the fund manager won’t
fully understand why one investment works and why another doesn’t. The
manager may have a sense of panic when market conditions change, and his
or her fund investors won’t get good accountability or explanations. When
you hear, “We don’t want to be hemmed in by one style” or “The fund uses a
top-down, bottom-up, micro and macro plus or minus market conditions
approach,” run away!
Top-down analysis
Top-down fundamental analysis examines the overall state of the economy.
The researcher uses the findings to identify specific assets that he or she
expects to benefit or suffer from the changes in the overall state of the econ-
omy, like price increases, employment levels, and interest rates. A top-down
analyst, for example, may look at consumer-debt levels, project future changes,
and then look for companies affected by the changes. Will an increase in con-
sumer debt help or hurt car and appliance manufacturers? High-end retail-
ers? Bargain retailers? Financial-service firms that emphasize lending or
savings? If the researcher has a framework in place for analyzing the trends
of the overall changes in the economy, he or she can select companies
expected to change in price and structure the portfolio accordingly.
Top-down investing is sometimes called theme investing, because a fund man-
ager looks for a handful of broad trends and invests based on those trends.
The fund may look to benefit from an aging population, higher energy prices,
or increased defense spending, for example. In some cases, a firm may have a
portfolio strategist who works to determine the themes. The firm’s other ana-
lysts, who may use different analytical approaches, have to narrow their
search to securities that fit the themes.
One major theme of top-down fundamental research is the use of economic
analysis. Hedge funds often use economic analysis as part of their investment
strategies, no matter their overall research styles. And if the funds invest in
several of the world’s markets, economic analysis is especially important.
86
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

Hedge fund managers perform economic analysis in order to determine the
best ways to profit from changes in economic trends, like inflation, unemploy-
ment, interest rates, or growth in a nation’s gross domestic product. Most
hedge fund managers at least think about the underlying economy when
making investment decisions, and some hedge funds, known as macro funds,
base their entire strategy around economic changes (you can read more
about macro funds in Chapter 13).
The following sections explore the different levels of economic analysis
within top-down research.
A microeconomic approach
Microeconomics relates to the structure of small units in the economy, like
individual companies or households. Microeconomic analysis looks at condi-
tions, like how much competition or regulation exists in a market, how easy it
is for new companies to enter a market, and how taxes cause a specific com-
pany to behave. Microeconomic analysis is practically synonymous with fun-
damental research, because the hedge fund manager wants to know how
changes in prices, competition, and product trends affect the prospects for 
a given company.
A macroeconomic approach
Macroeconomics looks at the overall national or even global economy. Macro-
economic analysis is concerned with exchange rates, interest rates, price
levels, growth, and employment. Hedge funds that invest heavily in govern-
ment bonds, financial derivatives, and currencies generally pay attention to
macroeconomic analysis. Managers of these funds use data published by gov-
ernment agencies, central banks, and non-governmental organizations such
as the United Nations and the World Bank to develop forecasts for changes in
price levels.
Secular versus cyclical trends
Trends fall into two categories: secular and cyclical. A cyclical trend is related
to economic cycles. For example, when employment improves, more people
are working, and these new employees need clothes to wear to work, so they
buy more threads, increasing revenue for apparel companies. A secular trend
represents a fundamental shift in the market, regardless of the cyclical trends.
For example, in the 1970s, a growing number of women took jobs. These
women needed clothes, creating an entirely new market: business clothes for
women. Retailers like Talbots grew and changed to meet the new market
demand.
87
Chapter 5: Hedging through Research and Asset Selection

Another secular trend in the clothing industry is the move toward casual
dress in the office. In the 1990s, the economy boomed and white-collar
employment grew, but folks were wearing khakis and golf shirts rather than
suits and ties. Sales were strong at retailers that sold casual apparel, but
sales dropped off at traditional suit makers like Brooks Brothers. Even if 
professionals bought their golf shirts at suit stores, they spent less money
than they would’ve on crisp white shirts and expensive silk ties.
The challenge for an investor is separating the cyclical economic trend,
which is temporary, from the secular economic one, which is not.
Demographics
Demographics, or the makeup of the population, are drivers for many busi-
nesses and economies. Companies need to worry about the demographics 
of their employee and customer bases, and nations need to worry about the
people within their borders. Young populations tend to have cheap, unskilled
workers, and older demographics usually have highly skilled, experienced,
and expensive work forces. Young people tend to borrow money to spend;
older people spend their savings; and people in the middle tend to set aside
more than they spend.
Demographic research is economic research. Understanding the nature of 
the demographics within a population can help hedge fund managers make
better decisions and separate cyclical from secular trends (see the previous
section).
Bottom-up analysis
A bottom-up investor looks for individual companies that he expects to do
especially well or especially poorly in the future. The investor starts his fun-
damental research by examining the company itself — its financial state-
ments, its history, its product line, the quality of its management, and so on.
He then makes a judgment about the company’s value on its own merits. The
researcher incorporates broad market trends only as they directly affect the
business, which sets bottom-up analysis apart from top-down analysis (see
the previous section). The bottom-up investor believes that he can find good
and bad investments in any industry at any time.
A subset of bottom-up research is known as the story stock — an offbeat 
company with complex products or unusual circumstances that require elab-
orate explanations. Sometimes story stocks prove to be good investments —
meaning that they go up in price as those who tell the stories expect them 
to — especially if the companies are harbingers of change in their industries;
88
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

other times, these companies make good shorts (see Chapter 11 for more
information on short-selling).
I’m a bottom-up fundamentalist with an accounting bias, myself (see the fol-
lowing section for more on accounting). I like tying an investment’s value to
the issuer’s performance, assets, and prospects. I don’t fully understand tech-
nical analysis, and I make no apologies for that (see the section “Reading the
charts: Technical analysis” later in this chapter). (I know, I know, I should
pick up Technical Analysis For Dummies, just to see what the fuss is about!) If
you like following patterns and looking for trends more than you like crunch-
ing numbers and reading regulatory filings, technical analysis may be for you.
Focusing on finances: Accounting research
Some bottom-up investors (see the previous section) look only at a com-
pany’s reported financial statements, ignoring other aspects of its business.
These investors look for evidence of fraud, unsustainable growth, or hidden
assets. This examination is known as accounting research. Often accountants
themselves, the accounting analysts who examine the companies understand
the many nuances and judgment calls that go into preparing financial state-
ments. In most cases, the goal of accounting research is to identify potential
short ideas (see Chapter 11 for more information on short-selling).
Gnawing on the numbers: 
Quantitative research
Quantitative research looks strictly at numbers. These numbers may repre-
sent accounting figures (for example, accounts receivable relative to sales),
or they may be sensitivity factors (for example, how much a company’s profit
changes when oil prices increase by 1 percent). Quantitative analysts, often
called quants, tend to put the information they find into complex mathemati-
cal models, and the solutions that result correspond to the securities that
investors should put into the portfolio. Firms that rely heavily on quantitative
analysis are often called “black-box shops,” because the quants put numbers
into a computer, which then spits out the portfolio selection, and only a
handful of people understand how it works.
Quantitative analysis is often derived from a refinement of the Modern
(Markowitz) Portfolio Theory, which I discuss in great detail in Chapter 6. The
Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory says that a security’s performance is
related to its overall sensitivity to the performance of the market. A refinement
89
Chapter 5: Hedging through Research and Asset Selection

of the theory is the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), which looks at a security’s
sensitivity to a range of macroeconomic factors (for example, commodity
prices, exchange rates, interest rates, and unemployment) rather than just the
market. Equations based on the Arbitrage Pricing Theory are long regressions
used to measure how well a given security fits with the forecast for the factors.
Reading the charts: Technical analysis
Technical analysis involves looking at charts of the price and volume of trad-
ing in a security. The charts show the historic supply and demand for the
security, which may indicate where future prices are heading. The informa-
tion shows a measure of sentiment. Analysts look to any number of ques-
tions: Is the number of buy orders increasing? Are the orders increasing while
the price goes up or while the price goes down? Is the stock’s price rising
steadily, or does it go up in bursts around news announcements? Technical
analysts use the answers to these types of questions to make investment
decisions. The following list goes into more detail about technical issues:
 Price: The first statistic that technical analysts look at. The price-review
process goes as follows:
1. Analysts often start with a bar chart that marks the opening, high,
low, and closing prices for each day of trading. The visual charts
help the analysts see if prices are generally trending up or gener-
ally trending down.
2. Next, they find out if trading is causing the trend line to change (a
reversal) or if it follows the trend (a continuation). The answers
give a sense of how the future performance will follow.
3. Finally, analysts look at resistance levels. Does the price keep going
up, or does it normally stick or start to go down at a certain level?
Does the price keep going down, or does it seem to bottom out
before going back up at a certain level?
 Volume: Shows how many securities are traded each day. When com-
pared to prices, volume tells the analyst how many investors care about
the security enough to move the price. Big price changes on small
volume may indicate that investors are manipulating the price.
For further fundamental research, technical analysts calculate money
flow, which is the average price for the day ([high + low + close] ÷ 3)
multiplied by the volume for the day. If the price ends up for the day, 
the money flow is given a positive number; if the price ends down, the
money flow is given a negative number. At that point, analysts calculate
90
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

a ratio with the number of days of negative money flow in the numerator
and the number of days of positive money flow in the denominator.
Analysts consider money flow in the range of 30 percent to 70 percent
normal. Above that, the security may be about to decline in price; below
that, the security may be about to increase in price.
 Patterns: In addition to the basic measures of price and volume, techni-
cal analysts look for patterns that may indicate where a security’s price
will move. They often look for patterns by drawing lines to show how
the trends are moving.
Although they have clever names like “head and shoulders,” “teacup and
handle,” “flag and pennant” — not to mention wedges, triangles, rectan-
gles, and channels — the patterns can be difficult to recognize. Some
hold for short time periods, and others hold for longer eras. In fact, some
technical analysts look for patterns called Elliott waves and Fibonacci
waves, which may explain prices over decades and even centuries.
 Momentum: An accelerating security price change is said to show
momentum. Positive momentum is good, and negative momentum is 
bad (ground breaking, I know). Many growth-stock investors look for a
combination of technical momentum and earnings momentum (acceler-
ating earnings growth) to identify stocks that they expect to show above-
average price appreciation.
Few funds rely on technical analysis exclusively, but many investors use it
regularly as a check on their fundamental research. Technical analysis is
complicated, which means that the dabbler can run into trouble.
How a Hedge Fund Puts Research
Findings to Work
So, what happens when a hedge fund’s research identifies some great oppor-
tunities in different assets? Well, the fund takes a position. It can go long —
buy in hopes that the asset goes up — or go short — sell in hopes that the
asset goes down. The fund can also trade securities, monitor positions that
may pay off in the future, or look for other ways to turn the information into a
return for the hedge-fund investor. I discuss these options and more research
findings in the pages that follow.
91
Chapter 5: Hedging through Research and Asset Selection

The long story: Buying appreciating assets
When a hedge fund manager or other investor buys a security, he or she is
said to be long. An investor has only one reason to go long: He or she thinks
that the asset will go up in price. Some hedge fund managers look for longs
that will work over an extended period of time — possibly years — and
others prefer to make their profits over very small stretches of time — 
possibly seconds.
Buying low, selling high
The secret of making money is buying low and selling high. Easy, huh? 
But what marks low and high? Answering this question is where research
comes in. The fund buys the security (with cash on hand or with leverage;
see Chapter 11) and holds it until it reaches a higher price or sells it if it
becomes clear that the investment isn’t working out. The research should 
set the price targets for establishing and selling the position.
When the asset reaches its price target, the fund may sell it or go back to its
research methodology to see if the fund should set a new target. The differ-
ence between the purchase price and the sale price — adjusted for borrow-
ing, interest, and commissions — is the profit (or loss) for the position.
Trading for the short term
Many hedge funds are aggressive traders, meaning that they often take posi-
tions for only a very short time. They look to capture small increases in price,
but they do it every day, over and over again, so that the amounts compound
into a very large return. The hedge fund structures of light regulation, limited
investor liquidity, and maximum return for a given level of risk very much
favor trading.
Holding for the long term
Some hedge funds take a long-term outlook with their securities. They look to
buy and hold, to establish a position and then wait weeks, months, or even
years to be proven right.
The buy-and-hold style is less common in hedge funds than in other invest-
ment vehicles, such as mutual funds or individual accounts, because the
hedge-fund structure is less of an advantage to the investor with a long-term
outlook than to the active trader. Still, many hedge funds do buy and hold —
especially if they’re playing with private and illiquid investments (see the sec-
tion “Custom products and private deals” earlier in this chapter).
92
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

The short story: Selling depreciating assets
Hedge funds can make money by selling securities, and not necessarily 
securities that they own. A short-seller borrows a security from someone else
(usually from a brokerage firm’s inventory) and then sells it. After a while —
ideally, after the security goes down in price — the short-seller buys back the
security in the market and repays the loan with the asset that he originally
borrowed. The lender doesn’t have to repay the original dollar value, just the
security in question. The profit (or loss) is the difference between where the
short-seller sold the security and where he bought it back, less commissions
and interest charged by the lender (see Chapter 11 for more on short-selling).
In the derivatives markets, someone who’s short has an obligation to sell in
the future, but it doesn’t matter if he or she holds or has borrowed the under-
lying security now (for more on derivatives, see the section “First Things
First: Examining Your Asset Options”).
Protecting long positions
Hedge funds are in the business of reducing risk, and short-selling is one risk-
reducing method. By selling off part of the risk, the fund can make money
while hedging the long position. For example, if a fund’s quantitative research
finds that a given investment is heavily exposed to the price of oil, the fund
can get rid of that risk by shorting oil futures. The fund offsets any gain or
loss in the investment’s price caused by sensitivity to oil with the gain or loss
of the futures position.
Investment shorts (unlike the shorts you can’t get rid of)
An investment short is a short-sell taken in a legitimate business that the fund
doesn’t expect to do well. A fund may make the decision to go with an invest-
ment short as part of a matching long position in a competitor that it expects
to do well, as part of a risk-management maneuver, or purely for investment
success.
Fraud shorts (nope, not Capri pants)
A fraud short is an investment that the fund expects to go down in value
because of suspicions that the company is guilty of misrepresenting its prod-
ucts, its financial results, or its management (see the section “Focusing on
finances: Accounting research”). These investments are rare, but funds make
a few of them every year. A fraud short is risky stuff — the management of a
company that a fund heavily shorts will probably fight back, sometimes with
ugly tactics, and short sellers who are anxious to get the news flow moving in
their favor have been known to resort to lies and threats.

Chapter 5: Hedging through Research and Asset Selection

Naked shorts (excuse the oxymoron)
A fund exacts a naked short when it sells a security that it hasn’t borrowed in
hopes that it will go down fast enough that the fund can buy back the secu-
rity and settle with the buyer. Naked shorting is against exchange regulations
in most markets, but it still happens. The advantage for the fund is that it can
sell short without paying interest to the lender, and it can sell short even if no
lender will loan the fund the security. The downside is that if the fund can’t
repurchase the security in time to settle its sale, the exchanges will find out
and probably shut down the fund.
Because of the illicit nature of the technique, you shouldn’t invest in any fund
that admits to naked shorting.

T
he goal of a hedge fund is to decrease investment risk and increase
investment return. People who study finance in an academic sense tend
to think about risk and return differently than other folk, so it helps to under-
stand the dominant thinking. I’m not saying that all hedge funds follow the
academic principles, but they may use the language.
Many hedge fund managers are smart people, and they often look the part —
a bit nerdy. They may not be the slick folks who throw great parties and drive
fancy cars. Instead, they often have finance PhDs and love nothing more than
calculating market strategies to exploit investment opportunities that other
investors haven’t discovered. I’m sure they like fancy cars, too, though.
Running a hedge fund is more interesting to a manager than teaching under-
grads, and it increases the likelihood that the car in her garage will be a
Porsche rather than an econobox.
Understanding research that dives into the market’s mechanics can help you
make better decisions for where to place your hard-earned savings. And if
you decide not to put your money into hedge funds, some knowledge of the
theories behind risk, return, and diversification can make sure you avoid fads
that don’t help you meet your investment goals. Even if some of the theories

in this chapter seem far-fetched to you, they’ll help you understand what
drives other investors who buy and sell securities.
This chapter gives you a quick summary of investment theory. I present it
from an academic perspective, but don’t let that scare you off. I have very
good reasons for doing this! You’ll run into this material when you talk to
hedge fund managers and other investment professionals, so you may as well
know what they’re talking about, or at least where to look. After you read this
chapter, you’ll be prepared when investment discussions turn to alpha, beta,
or standard deviation. Some of the material is technical, but hedge-fund man-
agement and investment is a technical business.
Market Efficiency and You, 
the Hedge Fund Investor
When people try to describe the securities market, they start with one key
assumption: The market is efficient. Efficiency means that a security’s price
reflects all information, good and bad, about the security. It doesn’t mean
that the price predicts the future. All kinds of surprises can and do happen.
However, if someone knows something, the knowledge shows up in the price.
This definition leads to one of the many popular economics jokes:
Q. How many investors does it take to change a light bulb?
A. None — the market price already reflects the change.
If the market isn’t efficient, the price of an asset will be very different from its
actual value.
Hedge fund managers and their analysts spend their days looking for ways 
to make money in efficient markets. Their research also contributes to effi-
ciency because they find information that investors can use to figure out
where they want to buy and sell particular stocks or bonds. In the next few
sections, I’ll show why this process should matter to you.
Why efficiency matters
Why should you care about market efficiency? Well, a hedge fund manager’s
attitude toward efficiency determines how she goes about making money
(making you money, in other words). If she believes in perfect efficiency, for
example, she’s likely to pursue a strategy that involves risk management
96
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

through leverage instead of emphasizing securities selection (see Chapter 11
for more information on leverage). If she believes in total inefficiency, she’s
likely to spend much of her time doing research on specific securities and
then committing a good portion of the fund’s money to securities that she
thinks will outperform the market. You should find a manager whose beliefs in
efficiency and resulting strategies match up with your investment objectives.
When you evaluate performance claims (see Chapter 14 for more on evaluat-
ing performance), keep in mind that markets tend to be efficient over the
long run. In investing, as in life, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
If a hedge fund manager tells you that her strategy will make huge profits by
exploiting massive inefficiencies, you want to find out what she considers to
be an inefficiency, why she thinks that the inefficiencies exist, and what will
happen if another investor acts on the discovery. (See Chapter 18 for more
on doing your due diligence.)
Perusing profitable inefficiencies
Sometimes, the research of a fund manager or an analyst uncovers inefficien-
cies where a fund can make a profit. Such inefficiencies aren’t easy to find,
but they do exist. Investors are most likely to find profitable inefficiencies in
markets that aren’t well researched, like some emerging markets (countries
with newly developing economies and stock markets). They also exist where
investor psychology seems out of step with the underlying value of the assets
(witness the dot-com bubble). Some researchers have pinpointed common
inefficiencies; for example, stocks with a low price-to-book value (that is, a
low stock price relative to the balance sheet net-worth) tend to outperform
the stock market as a whole.
Efficiency and the random walk
When hedge fund managers talk about securities prices, they sometimes use
the term random walk. What they mean is that without new information, a
security’s price moves randomly. Some days the price is up a little, and some
days it moves down a little, but you can’t predict the price. Only new infor-
mation changes the magnitude and direction of a price change, and those
changes also come in a random and unpredictable fashion; after the market
(that is, everyone trading all the stocks and bonds on the exchanges) assimi-
lates the news, the price goes back to changing randomly.
97
Chapter 6: Calculating Investment Risk and Return

Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago developed the random-walk theory
in the mid-1960s; Burton Malkiel, a professor at Princeton, later wrote a popu-
lar book based on Fama’s work titled A Random Walk Down Wall Street (W.W.
Norton & Company).
Fund managers who believe in the random walk believe in the strongest pos-
sible market efficiency. They often invest only in index funds — mutual funds
that invest in the stock market in the same proportion as a major market
index, such as the S&P 500 (an index prepared by the Standard & Poor’s 
corporation that includes the stock of 500 large U.S. companies and that’s
designed to measure the overall performance of the stock market). They also
claim that throwing darts at the quotes page of the Wall Street Journal is as
likely to generate a top-performing stock portfolio as any intensive research.
Keep in mind that if the markets are mostly efficient and if stock prices are
mostly random, it’s very difficult for hedge fund managers and other investors
to outperform the market. It’s possible, and it happens, but it isn’t easy.
One reason that academic theory about market behavior may seem so unre-
alistic is that almost all the research assumes that markets are efficient. In
the real world, markets have pockets of inefficiency — sometimes they last
ten minutes, and sometimes they last for years (think of the infamous dot-
com bubble). But keep in mind that scholars are working on models of what
could happen in ideal conditions. Without models, researchers and analysts
can’t perform the tests that improve our understanding of why things work
the way they do. If you can keep this in mind, market theories will make a lot
more sense.
Using the Modern (Markowitz) 
Portfolio Theory (MPT)
Harry Markowitz, as a graduate student at the University of Chicago in 1946,
wrote his doctoral dissertation on how investors balance risk and return. His
dissertation was the first step in what’s now known as the Modern Portfolio
Theory (MPT). Markowitz believed that investors are rewarded for taking risk.
Investors who buy many different securities will find that the risk of each off-
sets the risk of the others, leaving the investor with only the risk in the market.
In other words, the only risk that pays off is market risk. Investors who want
more risk than the market should borrow securities (use leverage; see Chapter
11) to increase their exposure to market risk. Likewise, investors who want less
risk than the market should mix up their market investments with low-risk
assets like treasury bonds.
98
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

The MPT is the way that almost all professional investors think about the
world. It’s a basis for structuring portfolios, evaluating trades, and explaining
performance. Even when investors have disagreements with the theory, they
use its language to describe what they’re doing. If you plan to invest in hedge
funds, you need to have an understanding of how fund managers think about
investing.
As time went on, the theory seemed to outgrow the label “modern,” and
Markowitz’s work seemed deserving of even more honors than his 1990 Nobel
Prize for the revolutionary approach to finance. Nowadays, many people honor
the good professor by having the “M” in MPT stand for “Markowitz.” If you 
do more financial reading or talk to people in the financial field, you’ll hear
“Markowitz Portfolio Theory,” “Modern Portfolio Theory,” and “MPT” used
interchangeably. To help you keep it straight, I combine them in this book: 
the Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory (MPT).
So what’s risky?
Markowitz defined risk as a function of standard deviation — a statistic that
shows how much your return may vary from the return that you expect to
get. Say, for example, that a fund manager expects a security to have an aver-
age return of 10 percent over two years. If it returns 10 percent the first year
and 10 percent the second year, the manager sees no deviation between any
one return and the average return. But if the security returns 20 percent one
period and 0 percent the next, it still returns an average of 10 percent, but it
has big deviations from the 10-percent mean. The more a security swings
around the expected return, the riskier it is.
Table 6-1 shows the math that goes into a standard-deviation calculation.
(Nope, you don’t need to know this for a final; I just include it to show you
where the magic numbers come from.) It takes the closing prices for Johnson
& Johnson and Yahoo! in December of 2005, calculates the percent changes

No Nobel Prize in Economics?
Here’s some trivia about the Nobel Prize in
Economics: Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will, which cre-
ated the other Nobel Prizes, didn’t mention it,
and the Nobel Foundation, which awards the
physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and
peace prizes, doesn’t give it. The economics
prize is affiliated, however. The Prize in Economic
Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was cre-
ated in 1968 by the Bank of Sweden, which
awards the prize.

the average of all the month’s daily percent changes. The table shows a mea-
sure of how much each return can vary from the mean.

Mathematically speaking, standard deviation is the sum of the squares of the
difference between each return and the average return over an entire time
period. If you want a gander at the equation, here it is:
The result is a single number: the standard deviation for each stock for the
month. And in that period, Yahoo! had a higher standard deviation.
One problem comes with the standard deviation calculation: It considers get-
ting a greater return than expected to be as risky as getting a lesser return. In
the real world, most people disagree — they pay more attention to the likeli-
hood and magnitude of potential losses than to the range of potential gains.
Behavioral finance addresses this problem; I get to that topic in the section
“Investing on the Cutting Edge: Behavioral Finance.”
Reviewing risk types in the MPT
The MPT does more than just define risk as the standard deviation of returns.
It goes further to classify standard deviation as coming from company-
specific factors or market-related factors. If the entire stock market crashes,
for example, all stocks will go down in price, at least for a day or two — even
if many of the companies are doing fine. Simply by being part of the market,
companies take on some risk — a position Markowitz called systematic risk
(and which some people refer to as market risk).
Each security also has its own unique risk. A stock’s performance may
depend on management’s skill within a company, new product introductions
it makes, or its relationships with government regulators. These unique fac-
tors affect the security but not the market as a whole. Markowitz found that if
investors hold diversified portfolios, as hedge funds and individual investors
often do, all the unique risks of all the different securities cancel out, leaving
only systematic risk. That’s why the unique risk of securities is often called
diversifiable risk (along with unsystematic risk or specific risk).
So, why do you care? Well, in theory, you don’t get paid for diversifiable risk,
because you can easily eliminate it. In practice, however, hedge fund man-
agers and other investors often take on diversifiable risk, either because they
see little pockets of market inefficiency or because the assets are so unusual
that investors really can’t offset them with other securities (see the section
“Market Efficiency and You, the Hedge Fund Investor” for more).

Chapter 6: Calculating Investment Risk and Return

Distributing risk
Investors usually assume that the standard deviation (the measure of risk in
the MPT) is arranged evenly around the mean return — forming a nice bell
shape. What the distribution signifies is that returns that come in higher than
average are just as likely as returns that come in lower than average. If higher
and lower returns are equally likely to happen, a portfolio manager has an
easier time managing risk. A normal risk distribution curve looks like the one
in Figure 6-1.
Risk isn’t always distributed so neatly, however, and an uneven distribution
can cause issues for hedge funds. If risk in a hedge fund is almost distributed
normally, a hedge fund manager will almost be able to manage the risk involved.
Occasionally, a high-flying hedge fund is brought down by a sequence of
unpleasant events (interest-rate increases, currency collapses, stock market
crashes, and the like) that people in the industry knew were possible, but the
possibility turned out to be more likely than anyone expected.
Such events can destroy an investor very quickly, even if the market returns
to normal in short order. Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund run
by a group including two Nobel-Prize winning economists, was ruined in 1998

when a handful of rare events occurred at the same time (see Chapter 1 for
more discussion on this fund).
Even though you may not want to see any more statistics, I throw some more
at you here (sorry!). Two types of risk distribution come up when people talk
about hedge funds: long-tail risks and fat-tail risks. If you know the difference,
you can have smarter conversations with hedge fund managers — conversa-
tions that lead to smarter decisions about your money.
Hunting long-tail risk
When looking at the normal curve in Figure 6-1, you see that both of the ends
are the same size. This indicates a balance between the likelihood of good
things happening and the likelihood of bad things happening. Now, suppose a
hedge fund manager spots an event that’s possible but highly unlikely. In this
situation, the curve would feature one end that’s way out beyond the end of
the normal curve — known as a long-tail distribution. You can see an example
in Figure 6-2. In short, long-tail risk says that just because an event hasn’t
happened yet doesn’t mean it won’t happen.
One example of long-tail distribution is wealth in the United States. Only 10
percent of Americans had a net worth of more than $831,600 in 2004, accord-
ing to the Federal Reserve Bank. That 10 percent includes the thrifty worker
who paid off his mortgage and maximized his 401(k) contribution, and it
includes Bill Gates’ billions. The huge amount between a person who has

Chapter 6: Calculating Investment Risk and Return

exactly $831,600 and the founder of Microsoft is an example of a long-tail 
distribution.
In terms of hedge-fund risk, the long-tail includes risks that are remote but
possible — like the collapse of the U.S. government or an earthquake that
destroys Tokyo. One concern within the industry is that some hedge funds
earn abnormally high returns by taking on large numbers of long-tail risks. No
matter how unlikely some events are, anything can happen, and the results of
an unexpected event can be catastrophic. One of the many contributing fac-
tors that led to the collapse of the fund Long-Term Capital Management was
Russia’s refusal to pay back its debts (see Chapter 1 for more detail on the
fund). Until that point, financial scholars always assumed that a government
would figure out a way to pay back what it borrowed — by printing money if
it had to. So, financial analysts put the risk of default way out in the long tail,
if they considered it at all.
Focusing on fat-tail risk
If certain extreme events are more likely to occur than other events, the look
of a distribution gets a little chunky at the ends of the bell. Such a distribu-
tion is called a fat-tail distribution. If an investment has fat tails, the price of
the security probably swings a lot more than otherwise expected, so you’re
more likely to get really high — or really low — returns than otherwise
expected.
You can see the difference between a normal curve and a fat-tailed distribu-
tion in Figure 6-3. The difference isn’t huge, but you can spot it, and you’ll
want to know as much as you can about it if your return sits on one of those
tail ends.

Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

What I’m trying to say is that if your hedge fund has a fat-tail return, you may
make more money than you expect or you may lose more money than you
expect. If the fund’s risk-management system assumes a normal distribution
of returns when it actually has a fat-tailed distribution, you and the fund
could run into trouble.
Determining the market rate of return
The Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory looks at how an investment per-
forms relative to the market. (The market, in financial theory, is anything and
everything that one can invest in.) The tricky part of the theory is figuring
out how the market performs. Most people start by coming up with a defini-
tion for the market. In most cases, investors use a market index like the S&P
500, because the index is designed to sample the market. Often, investors
have the option to buy index funds or exchange-traded funds, which are
investments designed to perform exactly like the market index. Thanks to
these funds, investors have an easy way to get market performance — which
also means that they expect more return or less risk when they choose a
hedge fund instead.
The market rate of return reflects the risk of investing in the market rather
than in a risk-free asset. The risk-free asset is usually a short-term U.S. gov-
ernment security, like a treasury bill. The market return you look at is the
market risk premium, which is the difference between the market return and
the return on the risk-free asset. (If you flip to the section on the Capital
Assets Pricing Model, you’ll see that it looks at that difference when calculat-
ing the expected return on an asset.)
Naturally, academic researchers debate the size of the risk premium. The
matter is complicated by which time period they use to calculate it. The fol-
lowing list gives some different schools of thought:
 The New York Stock Exchange has been in existence since 1792, and
some price data is still floating around out there from its inception. It
isn’t necessarily accurate or fully comparable to more recent data, but
the motivated researcher can find and use it.
 Others prefer to look at the risk premium after the 1929 stock-market
crash. That date marks a low point in the market; you can find accurate
data from that date; and the U.S. government passed new regulations
after the crash to ensure market integrity. Some regulations are still in
place, and you can read all about them in Chapter 3.
 Still others prefer to use data after the end of World War II, when the
United States became a dominant world power and the economy
entered its modern era.
105
Chapter 6: Calculating Investment Risk and Return

Does it matter which time frame investors use for the risk premium? Yes,
because the size of the average market return over and above the risk-free
rate of return affects people’s expectations for the market. A hedge fund man-
ager who assumes that a 7-percent risk premium is normal has a different
investment approach than a manager who assumes that a 9-percent premium
is normal. Some hedge fund managers invest without regard to market expec-
tations, but others use the market to peg their investment strategies. It’s hard
to say which technique is better, but the choice affects a manager’s market
expectations and strategies.
Beta: Ranking market return
In the 1960s, William Sharpe, a professor at Stanford University and a Nobel
laureate; John Lintner, a professor at Harvard Business School; and Jack
Treynor, an employee at Merrill Lynch did some work on Markowitz’s model
and came up with an application for it: the Capital Assets Pricing Model, or
CAPM. The CAPM is a refinement of the MPT; the model says that investment
return is a function of the general rate of return on the market combined with
how sensitive a given asset is to the market’s performance. The number used
to measure that implied risk is called beta. Hedge fund managers use beta to
rank the systematic risk of an asset. The following sections present the math
involved with beta and its real-world applications.
Doing the beta math
I know that math probably makes your eyes glaze over, but you have good
reasons to recognize the equations involved with beta and understand what
they mean. Some hedge fund managers really do use this stuff — or at least
their own versions of it. (In Chapter 11, for example, you can find plenty of
discussion on beta-neutral hedge funds.)
If you know what beta is, you’ll have an easier time understanding what your
fund manager is doing with your money. And even fund managers who sneer
at the CAPM because the real world is a lot messier than the theory makes it
out to be — you can find plenty of people who hold this opinion out there —
often use beta as a way of discussing market risk and comparing investment
returns.
Without further ado, here’s the beta equation:
E(r) = B(rm – rf) + rf
106
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

where E is the expected return on a security, B is beta, rm is the market rate of
return, and rf is the risk-free rate of return. In sentence form, it says that “the
expected return on a security is equal to beta times the difference between
the market rate of return and the risk-free rate, plus the risk-free rate.”
The formula for beta is complicated. It compares the standard deviation of a
security to the standard deviation of the market itself. In most cases, the per-
formance of an index, like the S&P 500 in the United States or the Nikkei in
Japan, measures the “market.” But people argue all the time about how to
define the market to come up with beta. To make matters even more compli-
cated, a given security’s beta changes over time.
Hedge fund managers who use beta have a few choices for finding their magi-
cal numbers. They may run their own internal computer programs, using
their own definitions of the market, or they may subscribe to research ser-
vices that calculate figures for them. If you’re curious about the beta of any
particular stock, you can find numbers through such online stock quotation
services as Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com) and MSN MoneyCentral
(moneycentral.msn.com).
You can bet, though, that a hedge fund manager uses a different source than
Yahoo! Finance; if you’re talking to a fund manager who relies heavily on beta,
ask how his fund workers calculate beta and how frequently it’s revised.
If you think back to your algebra days, you may notice that the Capital Assets
Pricing Model looks a lot like the equation for a line — y = mx + b, where m is
the slope of a line, x is a value on the X-axis, and b is the intercept on the Y-
axis. Similarly, the Capital Assets Pricing Model describes a rate of return that
changes according to the slope, beta; times the amount equal to the market
rate of return minus the risk-free rate of return; with the risk-free rate being
the place where the line crosses the Y-axis.
Math’s great, but what does beta mean?
What? You don’t care about the math involved with beta? You say you aren’t
working on your MBA, so you just want to know how the number affects you
and your investments? Okay, okay, I’ll tell you.
It’s like this: The market has a beta of 1. A financial researcher expects a
stock with a beta of more than 1 to move in the same direction as the market,
but at a greater level. So, if the market goes up, a stock with a beta of 1.5 goes
up by a greater percentage. Likewise, a stock with a beta of less than 1 moves
in the same direction but at a lesser percentage. And a stock with a negative
beta moves in the opposite direction of the market.
107
Chapter 6: Calculating Investment Risk and Return

So, if you think that the market is going up, you (or your hedge fund man-
agers) should buy plenty of high-beta securities to get a greater return. If you
want to reduce your exposure to the market, you should buy securities with
betas less than 1. And if you think the market is going down, you should look
for securities with negative beta because they’ll go up when the market goes
down. One easy way to create negative beta is to short a stock with a high
positive beta (see Chapter 11 for more on shorting), which is exactly what
many fund managers do when they expect the market to go down.
Now you know how hedge fund managers can use beta to manage the risk
and return parameters of their portfolios. Whew!
Alpha: Return beyond standard deviation
Ready for some more Greek? Allow me to introduce alpha. Hedge fund man-
agers love to use the word alpha — the measurement of investment perfor-
mance over and above market risk taken. Alpha is a factor financial researchers
add to the CAPM. Here’s the equation for alpha under the CAPM:
E(r) = B(rm – rf) + A+ rf
That letter A, or alpha, stands for some kind of additional return that the
market doesn’t explain (see the previous sections to find out what the rest of
the variables represent). To most academic types, alpha doesn’t exist. They
claim alpha is 0, because in an efficient market, the unexplainable differences
would disappear. Some research has shown that alpha may exist in some situ-
ations, however. For example, stocks with low prices relative to their book
values (assets minus liabilities) have been shown to perform better than
expected on a measure of beta alone.
Alpha appears before beta in the Greek alphabet, so why did I list Beta before
Alpha in this chapter? Beta is listed before alpha because beta came first in
the evolution of the CAPM, and because alpha has less support in theory. But
hedge fund managers love to talk about alpha, and that’s one of the reasons
why I also discuss it in Chapter 1.
To most hedge fund managers, alpha isn’t an esoteric subject for PhD candi-
dates to debate during late-night bull sessions. Alpha is real to them, so much
so that it’s their reason for being in the hedge-fund business. Alpha represents a
fund manager’s proprietary investment strategy, her great skill, and her justifi-
cation for the fund’s high fees (see Chapter 2). Basically, alpha represents the
value a hedge fund manager adds to the fund. A typical presentation to prospec-
tive investors by a typical hedge fund manager includes the magic words, “We
generate alpha by . . .,” at which point the managers launches into a description
108
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

of a research or arbitrage strategy (you can read more about the strategies that
fund managers use in their quest for alpha in the chapters of Part III).
Just keep two things in mind. First, if positive alpha exists, and it seems to, so
does negative alpha, which means that a hedge fund manager could do such
a bad job that she actually removes value from the portfolio. Second, fund
managers who find positive alpha consistently are also likely to demand high
fees for their stellar skills. Comprehensive due diligence (see Chapter 18) can
help you sort out the better managers from the clunkers.
Many hedge fund managers who discuss alpha don’t necessarily use — or
even believe in — the Capital Assets Pricing Model. They simply use the word
to describe what they plan to do for investors who invest money with them.
The Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT):
Expanding the MPT
The Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM) states that investment returns
depend on the risk-free rates of return and the market risk premiums (see the
section “Determining the market rate of return” for more). The CAPM sums
up this definition in an equation for a line, and generates numbers like “beta”
and “alpha” that fund managers and investors can use as shorthand for other
investment concepts.
But as neat as it is, the CAPM has some flaws. One particular flaw is logical:
Doesn’t it seem like investment returns might depend on things other than
the risk-free rate of return and the risk premium for the market? Maybe the
reason that securities have different betas, and the reason that betas change
over time, is that something other than the market dictates their movement.
And maybe alpha can be broken out and identified. These thoughts were run-
ning through the head of Stephen Ross, a finance professor, when he devel-
oped the Arbitrage Pricing Theory, or APT. The math looks like this:
E(r) = f1(rp1) + f2(rp2) + f3(rp3) + rf
where f1, f2, and f3 are different economic factors (like unemployment, commod-
ity prices, and commercial interest rates), and rp1, rp2, and rp3 are the returns
related to those factors. In English, the theory reads as follows: “The expected
return on an asset is equal to how sensitive the asset is to different factors in
the economy, multiplied by the risk premium that each of these factors has rel-
ative to the risk-free rate, plus the risk-free rate of return.” Depending on the
version of the theory used, an investor can look at only one or two factors, or
he can look at dozens. If you think about it, the CAPM is just a version of the
APT that cares about only one fact: sensitivity to market risk.
109
Chapter 6: Calculating Investment Risk and Return

Many hedge fund managers use a version of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory to
guide their asset selections. You may find a manager who has developed a
model internally that fits his own research and his own approach to the
market. APT models are almost always proprietary, so investors in the fund
don’t get to see what the model looks like. Funds that rely heavily on the APT
and similar models are sometimes called black-box shops, because they feed
data into computer programs and wait for lists of securities to pop out, but
investors never quite see what goes on with the program in the middle.
Even if a hedge fund you’re interested in is a black-box shop, it doesn’t pre-
vent you from getting some information about how the fund constructs its
model and what factors go into it. You should get an explanation before you
invest in the fund, during your due diligence (see Chapter 18) or before.
Discovering How Interest Rates 
Affect the Investment Climate
In the Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM; see the section “Beta: Ranking
market return”), the market rate of return depends in part on the risk-free
rate of return — the return that people want for giving up the use of their
money, even if they’re certain to get it back. For example, you can give your
mother a dollar tonight, and you know she’s good for it, but if you go through
a tollbooth on the way home tomorrow, you may be really bummed that you
gave up that money.
An interest rate is the price of money. It reflects three things:
 Giving up the use of the money (also called opportunity cost)
 The risk of not getting money back
 Inflation (the decline in purchasing power because of a general increase
in prices throughout the economy)
In this section, I explain the factors that go into interest rates and how inter-
est rates relate to hedge funds (and you). I also show you the power interest
rates have when they compound.
Seeing what goes into an interest rate
You hear financial types describe interest rates in two ways: real interest rates
and nominal interest rates. Real interest rates reflect risk. Nominal interest rates
110
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

reflect risk and inflation. Nominal rates are the rates you see posted in the
papers. You can’t get a quote on a real interest rate; you have to back inflation
out of a nominal interest rate. And yes, some people care about the propor-
tion of real interest rate included in the nominal rate, especially when inflation
levels are high. The following sections dive into the three factors reflected in
an interest rate.
Compensation for the use of the money
In the United States, the rate of return on short-term U.S. government securi-
ties — treasury bills — is usually thought of as the risk-free rate (see the sec-
tion “Determining the market rate of return”). The rate reflects the market
opportunity cost for giving up the use of the money, and because the bills
generally mature within 90 days, inflation isn’t an issue. And if the U.S. gov-
ernment doesn’t pay back its debts, all investors will have bigger problems
than determining the exact rate of interest in the economy (see Chapter 1 for
more on what can happen in this situation).
Risk of repayment
The risk of repayment varies with the overall economy — are people making
money and doing well, or are they struggling? — as well as with the attributes
of the specific borrower. Individuals have credit histories that show how
much debt they should be able to handle, and businesses and governments
have histories, too. The greater the likelihood of repayment, the lower the
interest rate. This is a simple example of the risk-and-return tradeoff.
Inflation
Inflation is a change in price levels in the economy. If prices go up, people
expect their investment returns to go up, too. If the returns don’t match the
change in price levels, the investors give up money on a real basis when they
invest.
In general, when inflation is high, so are interest rates. A little inflation is
good because it gives people reason to invest. Too much inflation, though,
causes people to spend money as fast as it comes in.
Inflation is the single biggest risk that most investors face. Investments that
people think of as safe often don’t return enough to beat inflation. Sure, you
can simply lock up your cash in a safe, but you lose purchasing power every
day that your cash sits there. In the long run, as long as you spend less
money than you earn and get a return that meets or beats inflation, you’ll be
okay, no matter if you put your money in a flashy hedge fund or in a more tra-
ditional investment, like a mutual fund.
111
Chapter 6: Calculating Investment Risk and Return

Deflation
Deflation is the opposite of inflation — it’s the general decline in price levels
in the economy. Deflation may seem like a good thing, but it isn’t. Instead of
consumers reveling in bargains around every corner, they become afraid to
invest, and the economy comes close to shutting down. In fact, if interest
rates are negative, consumers can increase their purchasing power by hold-
ing onto their money. Many historians believe that deflation caused the Great
Depression in the 1930s.
Deflation is rare, but it happens. And if it does happen, you want to invest
your money in a different country where it isn’t taking place.
Relating interest rates and hedge funds
Interest rates have many effects on risk and return within a hedge fund, and
in turn on hedge fund managers and their strategies. In the following list, I
cover some of the effects of interest rates:
 Hedge funds as borrowers. Many hedge funds pursue strategies that
rely on leverage, which means that they borrow money for investment
purposes. (You can read more about leverage in Chapter 11.) Naturally,
when a hedge fund borrows money, it has to pay interest, so if interest
rates are high, the fund will have higher expenses. Higher expenses lead
to a reduced investment return.
 Hedge funds as lenders. Hedge funds lend money out when they buy
bonds. Many hedge funds actively buy and sell bonds day in and day out
as part of their investment strategies. Interest rates affect the value of
derivatives, currencies, and stocks, too. The level of the rate affects the
return on investments, so hedge fund analysts pay plenty of attention to
risk and inflation in the overall economy.
 Hedge funds as risk managers. Most hedge funds are designed to
reduce investment risk. Because opportunity cost, business risk, and
inflation (the three factors that affect interest rates) are all risks that can
affect a hedge fund investor’s returns, many hedge funds pay attention
to interest rates to improve their risk management. To manage interest-
rate risk, they often use derivative securities such as futures and swaps,
which I describe in Chapter 5.
 Hedge funds as speculators. Some hedge fund managers try to predict
the direction of interest rates, using their predictions to speculate on
stocks, currencies, bonds, and derivatives. Predicting the future is always
risky, but some funds have computer models that may accurately show
how different securities will react to different combinations of economic
events. Interest-rate speculation is a high-risk endeavor that may pay off
with high returns, which is what some hedge fund investors want.
112

Witnessing the power 
of compound interest
Albert Einstein may have concentrated on the theory of relativity, but he was just
as fascinated with compound interest. Compound interest is a simpler concept
than physics, yet so many investors ignore the power of compounding to their
detriment. Compound interest is interest on interest, and it can make a dramatic
difference in the value of your investments. As financiers often say, those who
don’t understand compound interest are doomed to pay it. Hedge fund managers
know all about the power of compound interest, and that’s one reason they prefer
to keep their investors’ money locked up for relatively long periods of time.
Table 6-2 gives you a simple example of compound interest. Say you invest
$1,000 at 8-percent interest for 10 years. If you take the $80 earned each year
and spend it, your investment won’t grow. You’ll collect and spend a total of
$800 over the time period, which you can see in the left side of the table.

Chapter 6: Calculating Investment Risk and Return

Now, say that you keep the interest in your account and let it build up. Each
year, your money grows by the amount of interest earned the years before. At
the end of the 10 years, you’ll collect a total of $1,158.92 — almost 45 percent
more money.
Another great thing about compound interest is that small differences can add
up over time. Table 6-3 shows the value of an investment compounded at 8-
percent interest and the value of an investment at 8.1 percent. After 10 years,
the difference between the earnings of the two is small — only $20.00 — but it
has widened to almost 1.7 percent compared to 0.1 percent at the start. Carry
this difference out over 20 years, and you see an even greater difference.

For a hedge fund dealing with millions or billions of dollars, the differences in
compounded interest add up to greater and greater amounts. Table 6-4 shows
you the same information as Table 6-3, but it features an initial investment of
$1,000,000 rather than $1,000. The initial difference in interest rates of 0.1 per-
cent means a difference in income of $20,000. That’s real money!

Table 6-4 illustrates why hedge fund managers spend so much time and
energy looking for very small advantages in the market. They know that given
enough time and enough money, they can make little differences add up.
Investing on the Cutting Edge:
Behavioral Finance
The Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM; see the section “Beta: Ranking
market return”) and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory model (see the section
“The Arbitrage Pricing Theory [APT]: Expanding the MPT”) start with two
basic assumptions: They both assume that markets are efficient and that
market participants are rational.
Like human beings are ever rational? You see the problem.
Many financial researchers are working on ways to account for the fact that
people can do crazy things when dealing with money. That goes for fancy-
schmantzy hedge fund managers with Nobel prizes and for high-school grad-
uates trying to pick out investment options for their company-sponsored
retirement plans. The field in which these researchers work is called behav-
ioral finance — a field that’s trying to explain the common deviations from
116
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

rationality and efficiency so that people can better understand how financial
markets move.
And some of these researchers are picking up their own Nobel Prizes, too.
Examining the principles 
of behavioral finance
Traditional, stale finance insists that markets react immediately to information
and that, as a whole, the participants in the market are rational. It allows for
some irrational behavior but remains steadfast that it all cancels out. People
of this thinking believe that the overly optimistic trader and the overly pes-
simistic trader counteract each other, and the logical people win out.
Traditional finance also says that the more information that comes into the
market, the more efficient the market will be. But as data continues to get
cheaper, the market hasn’t become more rational and efficient. If anything,
the dramatic increase in instant news and free stock-price services has
caused investors to overreact and get carried away with trends.
Anyone with Internet access can get free information that professionals once
had to pay dearly for and even wait two or three days to receive. (Believe it
or not, there was a time when investors waited to receive earnings announce-
ments in the mail before making buy-and-sell decisions.)
Behavioral finance has a different thought process. It says that investors
make decisions by using quick rules, not rational analysis; it says that the
presentation of a decision can influence investors; and it says that markets
are inefficient. These are the principals of behavioral finance — a field that’s
still in its newer stage — and I outline them in the following sections.
Using quick and easy rules: Heuristics
A heuristic is a guideline for making a decision — a step-by-step approach
that says, “When you see this, do that.” This approach is a great way to make
decisions quickly, but it can keep people from being more efficient or from
noticing details that make the current situation different from the situation
last week, on which the heuristic worked just fine.
For example, many stock traders believe that you buy on the rumor and sell
on the news. When they hear whispers about a corporate takeover, they start
buying the company’s stock and then they sell it when an announcement hits
the airwaves. Sometimes, that strategy works like a charm. Other times, it
117
Chapter 6: Calculating Investment Risk and Return

causes a trader to acquire stock for no good reason and to sell it before a bid-
ding war breaks out.
Professional investors spend their days bombarded with price changes and
news feeds. The information comes so fast that they may not have the luxury
of thinking carefully about whether the rules of the game have changed. The
sheer volume and speed at which information flows into the market makes
rational analysis impossible. The use of heuristics may lead to an analysis
that’s almost, but not quite, rational.
Harnessing the power of presentation: Framing
In this chapter, I’ve presented a few equations dealing with financial theory.
Equations are great because they strip a problem of emotion; they even strip it
of words. Strings of letters, numbers, and symbols simplify a situation so that
you can make a rational decision. But the real world is all about story problems,
and many people respond to language better than to equations buried within.
The framing of a question is the way that someone presents it. If I offer you a
90-percent chance to make a dollar with a 10-percent chance of losing a dime,
you’ll probably take my offer. If I offer you a 90-percent chance of making $10
million and a 10-percent chance of losing a million, you may focus on that big
loss and turn the offer down. However, the risk and return is the same for both.
Investors see losses as terrible occurrences, which causes them to avoid
taking risks — even risks where the likelihood of a gain is greater than the
likelihood of a loss. Fear also causes investors to hang on to losing invest-
ments instead of admitting defeat, in the hopes that maybe, possibly, the
price will go up.
Professionals are better at pulling a problem away from its frame than most
individual investors, but they aren’t perfect. When December rolls around, a
hedge fund looking at a big year-end performance fee is likely to become con-
servative in order to protect that bonus. A hedge fund that sits under the
bonus threshold may get incredibly aggressive in the hopes that an invest-
ment will stick. Neither situation may suit the best interests of the fund
investors.
Battling inefficiency: Pricing anomalies
When the market is clearly inefficient, academics say that pricing anomalies
exist. Most of these anomalies disappear as soon as investors discover them.
Years ago, researchers found that stocks tended to perform better in January
than in any other month of the year. They called it the “January effect,” and it
seemed to defy market efficiency. However, soon as investors found out
118
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

about the January effect, they started buying stocks in December so that
they could take advantage of it. This rush led to such a demand in December
that it became the best-performing month of the year. At that point, investors
started buying stocks in November to take advantage of the December effect
that preceded the January effect. Eventually, the whole anomaly disappeared,
and nobody really talks about it much anymore.
Other anomalies seem to hold because of messy investor psychology, which
gives behavioral-finance experts some good areas for research.
The following sections show you some other sources of market inefficiency
that create pricing anomolies. Researchers in behavioral finance are explor-
ing these sources, and at some point, investors will have practical informa-
tion that they can apply. For now, you should keep these things in mind when
evaluating a hedge fund manager and discussing investment performance.
Groupthink
You know how in junior high everyone does things just because everyone else
does them? And how the worst thing in the world is to be different? People in
the investment world follow the same mentality, I’m afraid to say. On occasion,
everyone seems to think alike — often called groupthink or the herd mentality.
In the late 1990s, for example, every investor was so sure that Internet stocks
would enjoy enormous success for years to come that people who dared to
point out that maybe, just maybe, the valuations were crazy faced becoming
a social outcast, getting fired, or just being pitied.
The problem is that people can be right, but the truth can take a long time to
come to the light, and plenty of money can be lost in the meantime. John
Maynard Keynes, a famous economist who died before the Swedes started
giving Nobel Prizes in Economics, once said, “The market can remain irra-
tional longer than you can remain solvent.” Several hedge fund managers
were proven right about dot-com valuations in 2000, but many of those
people lost their clients before the truth came out.
Wage and price stickiness
In an efficient market, prices go up and down equally, and they respond to
information. In the real world, however, prices often don’t go down as much
as expected. Instead, they stick to some floor level. If a company needs to cut
its payroll, it has the option of cutting the salary of every worker equally.
More likely, however, the company will fire some workers so that others on
the job will make as much as before or even more. If a candy company enjoys
a drop in its ingredient prices, it will probably keep the difference as profit. If
it decides to give customers some of the savings, it will most likely increase
the size of its candy bars instead of cutting the price it charges for them.
119
Chapter 6: Calculating Investment Risk and Return

As long as some economic factors are less than perfectly efficient, the prices
of related securities will be less than perfectly efficient.
Bias toward the present
In academic theory, interest rates reflect the time value of money. The longer
you lend out your money, the more compensation you should expect for
giving up the use of the money and for any losses in purchasing power due to
expected inflation. In practice, however, investors seem much more inter-
ested in making money today. They don’t pay much attention to the effect on
potential return for holding money into the future or whether they’re getting
compensation for waiting.
Applying behavioral finance 
to hedge funds
As comfortable as they are with numbers and equations, most hedge fund
managers believe that markets are driven by more than pure logic. Many fund
managers pay attention to behavior to find investment opportunities (such as
George Soros; see the sidebar “George Soros and the theory of reflexivity”).
120
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 
George Soros and the theory of reflexivity
Not everyone working in behavioral finance is a
university professor. George Soros, a legendary
hedge fund manager, developed one of the
more interesting theories of how the market
behaves (you can read more about Soros in
Chapter 1). And because of his status, people
pay attention to what he has to say.
Soros’ theory of reflexivity says that there’s a
limit to how efficient security prices are
because the prices of securities influence
future economic and market behavior. Instead
of merely reflecting information, prices start to
affect it, which leads to periods where the
market is out of balance. Because security
prices cause these situations, they no longer
respond efficiently.
For example, if a stock price is going up,
investors sometimes take that observation as
proof that a company is attractive, so they buy
more of the stock and bid up the price. When
small companies in the same industry see that
prices are rising, they’re more likely to issue their
stock to the public in an Initial Public Offering, or
IPO. When venture-capital investors see the
profits being made on IPOs, they’re more likely
to fund new start-up companies that may go
public. Note: In this example, the driver is the
rising price of stock, not the information about
how the underlying business is performing.

Some fund managers incorporate information about how investors are behav-
ing into their expectations, and they make buy-and-sell decisions based on
their observations. Other fund managers look at how people are behaving
and go with the opposite strategy, on the theory that crowds are often wrong.
Other fund managers stick to their investment strategies — even during peri-
ods when the strategies aren’t working — under the assumption that rational-
ity will return at some point. One reason that hedge funds limit withdrawals
is so fund managers have time for their investment ideas to play out. If fund
investors panic and demand the return of their investments, the fund man-
agers have to play into near-term market irrationality, even if that isn’t the
best strategy for the hedge fund in the long run.

You Want Your Money When?
Balancing Time and Liquidity
In This Chapter
 Bringing your cash needs to light
 Keeping track of the time on your investment horizon
 Examining your principal needs
 Managing liquidity after you enter a fund
H
edge fund managers have the ability to make big profits on short-term
trades. It isn’t unusual for a fund manager to hold a security overnight,
or even for only a few minutes, in the pursuit of profit. Fund managers, how-
ever, aren’t keen on sharing their investment perks. They don’t let investors
in their funds trade in and out with the same frequency. A mutual-fund
investor, on the other hand, can cash out at any time.
The money you invest in a hedge fund may be locked up for years (see
Chapter 2 for more on the structure of hedge funds). Therefore, you need to
consider your cash-flow needs and your time horizon before making an
investment, and you need to find out how your needs match with those of the
fund manager. The needs of both parties may determine how much money
you should allocate to a hedge fund. You also need to know what to do if the
hedge fund returns money to you outside of a withdrawal. In this chapter, I
give you advice on how to handle liquidity challenges in your portfolio,
including when to make withdrawals, what to do when you receive a distribu-
tion of fund assets, and what to do in case of fund disbandment. Time to put
my money where my mouth is!

Considering Your Cash Needs
Whether you’re an individual investor trying to figure out what to do with
your annual bonus or a pension fund employee trying to allocate this year’s
contribution, you need a plan for your money, and you need to pick invest-
ments that match your plan. The decision is a three-step process that
involves answering questions and examining your cash needs:
1. Do you need the money to meet any obligations in the next year? If so,
you probably don’t want to put it into a hedge fund. Instead, check out a
short-term investment, like treasury bills or a money-market fund.
2. If you don’t need the money right away, do you have enough cash to
meet the minimum deposit for the types of investments you’re inter-
ested in? It isn’t unusual for a hedge fund to require an initial investment
of $250,000 or even several million dollars (see Chapter 2 for more on
initial payments).
3. If you’re interested in hedge funds, but don’t have enough money on
hand, you may need to start saving! Even though you may not need the
money for years, you may need to invest it for the short term. Saving for
a fund can be like saving for the down payment on a house: The house
itself is a long-term investment, but you need to produce the money to
buy it in short order.
Like Dollars through the Hourglass:
Determining Your Time Horizon
The answers to two questions go a long way toward determining how to
invest your money and what to invest it in:
 When do you need your money?
 What do you need your money for?
How much money you need to generate from an investment is closely related to
your time horizon. If you need money next week, you’ll invest it differently than
if you need the money in 40 years. Your monetary needs can change over time,
too. For example, a relatively new business may have a pension plan but no
retirees. Until its employees start retiring, the company can manage its pension
assets for maximum total return, without regard for income. When employees
start retiring, though, the company will have to reallocate some funds to gener-
ate income to meet each month’s pension payments.
124
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

No matter the answers you give to the two major questions, they’ll influence
the risk you can take, the return you need to shoot for (see Chapter 6), the
asset classes that are open to you (see Chapter 9), and how much time you
can allocate toward the investment.
Generally speaking, investable money falls into three categories:
 Temporary (or short-term) funds that you’ll need in a year
 Matched assets that you invest to meet a specific liability, like a college
education
 Permanent funds that you invest for such a long term that, for all practi-
cal purposes, you’ll never spend them
After you determine what you have planned for your money and when you’ll
need it, you can make better decisions about where to invest it. After all, a
hedge fund that forbids withdrawals for two years is a terrible investment for
you if you need your money in one year, no matter how good the fund’s track
record looks. The following sections cover the three investment categories in
more detail.
The rate of return on an investment reflects not only the risk, but also the
investor’s time horizon, because you give up the ability to spend your money.
Investors expect compensation when they give up access to their cash. In
economic terms, giving up your right to spend money now is called the
opportunity cost of an investment.
Taking stock of temporary funds
Temporary funds stay invested for a very short time. You may need the money
put in a temporary fund at any time, so you don’t want to tie it up. For exam-
ple, you may set up an emergency fund with six months worth of expenses. A
business may keep cash on hand to take advantage of bargains on inventory.
You may also set up a fund used to repay a loan due this year.
Investors usually keep temporary funds in treasury bills, money-market secu-
rities, and bank accounts. The return on these investments is low, but so is the
risk that comes with the investments. You can get your money out easily — in
some cases simply upon demand — with the assurance that the value will
hold. For these reasons, hedge funds aren’t suitable for temporary funds.
Hedge funds charge high fees. Standard charges include a management fee of
2 percent of assets and a bonus payment of 20 percent of the fund’s profits
125
Chapter 7: You Want Your Money When? Balancing Time and Liquidity

(see Chapters 2 and 4). Because fund managers need time to earn these fees,
they want money that investors can set aside for long periods.
Fathoming matched assets and liability
When an investor needs the funds he or she invests to meet a specific liabil-
ity at some point in the future, the investor is said to have matched assets.
The mother of a newborn knows that in 18 years, she will probably have a
college tuition to fund. A human-resources manager at a major multi-national
corporation knows how much money the corporation is likely to pay out in
pensions every year for the next 50 years. Investors can meet these liabilities
by investing assets now in order to earn a return sufficient enough to meet
the liabilities. The greater the expected return, the less money that a person
will have to invest.
The higher the rate of return on an investment, the lower its present value — a
good thing if you’re saving money, but bad if you’re borrowing it. Also note: The
higher the expected rate of return, the higher the expected amount of risk.
Table 7-1 shows the amount of money you’d have to invest today to generate
$1,000,000 in 10 years, figured at different rates of return. Note: This table
shows the value of the $1,000,000 as of press time. Notice that as the expected
rate of return increases, the amount of money you have to set aside today
decreases.

Invested Today
Some investors establish investment plans to meet a single obligation at an
approximate future point, like a college education. Other investors have a
range of obligations to meet. A pension fund, for example, has to pay out
money each month to retirees in the plan, and it has to invest money to pay
the youngest firm employee her benefits from the day she retires until the
day she dies, possibly 70 years from now. The folks in charge at the pension
fund will sit down with some actuaries and work out a schedule of the money
due at different dates. At that point, they invest money to generate the neces-
sary return to meet the targets. The fund treats the money needed to meet
126
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

this year’s payments to retirees as temporary funds, kept in short-term
investments (see the previous section). The fund may then invest money that
it doesn’t need for many years or a few decades in risky or illiquid invest-
ments, including hedge funds.
Whether a hedge fund is an appropriate match for an upcoming financial
need depends in large part on the risk profile of the hedge fund. An absolute-
return fund, which is designed to have low risk and a steady, low, return (see
Chapter 1), is usually a good match with an intermediate-term obligation, for
money that you don’t need until after you meet any lockup periods on the
fund. Directional funds, which pursue high-risk strategies in exchange for
higher expected returns, are a better match for financial needs that reach far
into the future.
Peeking into permanent funds
Some investors put away money with a plan that would drive shopaholics
crazy: To never spend it. Instead, the investors plan to spend only the income
generated from the investments’ interest and dividends. They can then rein-
vest the capital gains so that the initial amounts invested get larger, which
causes the amount of income that the investments can generate to grow.
And who are the lucky folks who can put away money forever if they choose?
Some very wealthy families hold money in trust for generations. More often,
university endowments and charitable foundations choose this investment
route. These organizations generally spend a small amount of their assets
each year — often only 5 percent — to support their activities. They invest
any return over and above the 5 percent to expand the total investment pool,
from which money is rarely spent. The amount of an investment pool in a per-
manent fund can be huge: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has $28.8
billion under management as of press time (not including the fortune that
Warren Buffett plans to donate to this foundation), and the State of Alaska
Permanent Fund, which manages and distributes a share of oil profits to state
citizens, is worth $30.0 billion. Both funds allocate some money to hedge
funds.
What’s 5 percent of $28.8 billion? Yep, $1.4 billion, which means the Gates
Foundation can do plenty of good in the world while growing its principal.
Money managers sometimes talk about the 11th Commandment: “Thou Shalt
Not Invade Thy Principal.” Principal is the amount of money you invest. If you
spend it, you can’t generate any income, the investment can’t grow larger,
and you can’t pass money on to the next generation.
127
Chapter 7: You Want Your Money When? Balancing Time and Liquidity

Permanent funds are often great investment candidates for hedge funds.
Most hedge funds are designed to generate steady capital gains, and they
limit withdrawals, so your fund’s money should build up over time.
Few managers structure hedge funds to generate income, so if producing
income is one of your key investment objectives, you should allocate your
funds to other types of investments, like bonds or dividend-paying stocks.
Poring Over Your Principal Needs
Investors have three primary investment objectives to consider. These are
the types of return that they hope to get from their investments:
 Income: Generates regular payments
 Capital appreciation: Attempts to grow the principal without regard for
income generated
 Total return: Combines income and capital appreciation
Managers generally structure hedge funds for capital appreciation, although
a few are managed for total return. Hedge fund investors often look to
increase their principal through capital appreciation. If you count yourself
among this honorable fraternity, you need to answer two questions:
 When do you need the money?
 How much leeway do you have in the amount you need?
If you absolutely need a fixed amount of money at a specific date in the future —
for example, if you have folks expecting pension checks — you probably need to
go with a low-risk investment. That may include a hedge fund, but it may not.
The more flexibility you have, however, the more a hedge fund may be suitable
as part of your portfolio. What determines your flexibility? You should consider
three important factors:
 Is the hedge fund investment relative to the size of your overall port-
folio? If you want to put almost all your investable assets into a hedge
fund, you better be investing money you don’t really need. In fact, if you
have to invest most of your assets, that may be a sign that the invest-
ment really isn’t suitable for you.
It’s paradoxical, I know, but the larger your overall portfolio, the more
flexibility you have and the more suitable hedge funds are for you. Yes,
yes, the rich get richer, as the saying goes, but hedge funds just aren’t
suitable for smaller investors. That caveat is one reason why managers
128
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

open funds only to accredited investors (see Chapter 2). Don’t fret,
though. I provide some advice on how to use hedge-fund techniques in
smaller portfolios in Chapter 16.
 What are the consequences if you’re a little bit off in your calcula-
tion? If your return is less than you expect, will you have to work an
extra year or two or scale down to only one retirement house rather
than two? Or will a small return cause you to default on a contractual
obligation? If you don’t have the flexibility to handle a return that’s less
than you expect, hedge funds aren’t suitable for you.
 How much time do you have between now and when you need the
money? The longer the time, the more risk you can take because you’ll
be able to make mid-course corrections in case your investment isn’t
working out as you had planned. If you allocate the hedge fund invest-
ment in support of an obligation due 30 years from now, you have more
flexibility than if you need the money in 2 years.
What flexibility shows is that a hedge-fund investment is most appropriate
for the permanent portion of your portfolio (see the section “Peeking into
permanent funds”). You don’t need the money now or in the near future to
support your life or any necessary obligations. You want to maximize your
return, of course, but you can afford to take some chances in terms of the
risk and the illiquidity.
A university endowment that needs to turn over only 3 percent of its assets
for spending and that adds money each year from donations, for example,
has far more flexibility than many other types of investors, which is one
reason universities have been big hedge-fund investors. Harvard University’s
endowment, which has been in operation for centuries and was valued at
$25.9 billion at the end of fiscal year 2005, receives new donations every year.
At Harvard, the endowment management personnel have to consider how to
generate the income promised to the university budget, oversee the invest-
ment of the permanent principal, and put the new money coming in to work.
What can you do if you can’t make a withdrawal from a hedge fund, but the
fund is performing so miserably that you’re in danger of losing all your money?
Unfortunately, not much. Although rare, it can happen. As a general rule, you
shouldn’t invest money that you can’t afford to lose in any illiquid investment,
hedge fund or otherwise. If you get in over your head, you may have to stand
by helplessly while your portfolio value goes to zero.
129
Chapter 7: You Want Your Money When? Balancing Time and Liquidity

Handling Liquidity After You 
Make Your Initial Investment
Most prime brokers are household-name brokerage firms and banks, like
Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns. Choosing and entering a fund is a big,
tough process, but your work doesn’t stop after you hand over your invest-
ment and ride out the minimum lockup period. Your hedge fund will (hope-
fully) generate money for your investment, giving you additional investment
opportunities. The fund may allow you to withdraw funds so you can meet
other objectives (but it comes with a price). The fund may also start sending
you checks to reduce its burden, or it may decide to disband altogether. The
following sections give you factors that can affect your investment objectives
after you enter into a hedge fund.
Taking advantage of additional 
investments
After you meet the strict requirements to get into a hedge fund, find the right
fund for your investment objectives, and go through initiation (just kidding),
you can begin to enjoy the perks of the fund: additional investment opportu-
nities. Your hedge fund manager may look to raise more money in order to
pursue interesting investment strategies that he sees in the market. His likely
initial inquiries will be with his current investors. A hedge fund is a partner-
ship, after all, and if all partners are happy, you’ll want to work together some
more. On the flip side, if you come into money that you want to add to the
fund, let your fund manager know. He may not need the money now, but he
may want it in the near future.
Your fund manager plans to reinvest the returns from the hedge fund. Every
time the fund manager receives an interest payment or sells an investment at
a profit, you make money that goes into the fund. Your underlying investment
increases as long as the fund has a positive return.
From the fund manager’s perspective, cash in the fund is a problem unless 
he can invest it to meet the risk-and-return profile that investors expect (see
Chapter 6). Sometimes, the manager simply can’t find enough investments
out there that meet the fund’s investment criteria. It’s also possible that the
fund doesn’t want to take on more money, although the manager will allow
you to buy shares from another investor — another good way to make addi-
tional investments after you enter a fund.
130
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

Investors make money when they buy low and sell high, as the cliché goes.
The best time to put more money into the fund is when its performance is
bad, because the assets that it invests in will be cheaper. Of course, this time
happens to be when you’re most likely to want to get out of the fund to cut
your losses. Knowing when to cut and when to buy more isn’t easy, but the
savvy investors who can do it will have better returns than investors who
chase return by buying high and selling low. Success in this regard is a combi-
nation of luck, skill, and experience. If I knew a sure-fire way to get it right, I
certainly wouldn’t tell you, because I’d be on a beach in Maui.
Knowing when (and how) 
you can withdraw funds
At some point, you may need to pull out money from your hedge fund. Maybe
you need to match an expense, or you need to move your money to another
investment that seems more suitable for your objectives. No matter your rea-
sons, any good investment plan requires ongoing reevaluation of your invest-
ment objectives (using material in this chapter) and how well your investments
are meeting them.
A hedge fund’s offering documents should set out how often you can make
withdrawals and how you should request a withdrawal. A hedge fund isn’t
like a mutual fund, where shares are continually issued and redeemed. You
can’t get online and transfer money with a few keystrokes whenever you like.
Hedge funds are closed investments with only a few investors (see Chapters
1 and 2 for more info on how hedge funds are structured).
You won’t find a standard withdrawal policy in the hedge-fund industry. A hedge
fund manager may even negotiate different policies for different investors in the
fund. Rumor has it that one really big, really secretive fund locks up investors
for five years. Others may allow withdrawals once a month with advance notice.
You need to know your needs before you invest in a hedge fund so that you
know what policies will match your portfolio requirements.
Instead of the rapid redemption services that mutual funds, brokerage firms,
or bank accounts offer, you’ll probably have to send written notice to a hedge
fund manager in advance of your withdrawal. The manager may lay out very
specific terms for how you should send the request (for example, certified
postal mail) if you want to get your money. The turnaround time between
when the manager receives the request and when he approves the with-
drawal may be a month; the hedge fund’s partnership agreement probably
specifies the time period (see Chapter 2 for more information).
131
Chapter 7: You Want Your Money When? Balancing Time and Liquidity

The fund manager has some options when it comes to raising your with-
drawal funds. She can
 Meet your request with cash on hand.
 Sell off some assets to raise the cash.
 Sell your shares to another investor.
You’ll receive the proceeds from the bank or prime broker that handles the
fund’s investments.
A hedge fund manager may not want to sell investments just to meet your
withdrawal request because it may screw up a carefully crafted investment
position or require her to sell an asset at a near-term loss. Also, some fund
investments are illiquid, meaning that they’re difficult to sell on demand. As a
result, a fund manager may view your withdrawal as something that will hurt
the fund’s remaining investors. To offset the hurt, some hedge funds impose
withdrawal fees, especially if investors want to pull out more than a small
amount (say, 5 percent of their total investments in the fund).
Your fund manager may also hold back some of your money until the fund’s
accountants have a chance to calculate the performance of the fund up to the
date of your withdrawal. It isn’t easy to calculate the value of some invest-
ments like venture capital (see Chapter 12), so the fund manager wants to
wait until she knows the value before settling up with you.
Receiving distributions
Although few hedge funds are designed as income investments (see the sec-
tion “Poring Over Your Principal Needs”), they sometimes send checks to
their investors. The checks may be distributions of income and capital gains,
or they may be returns of capital. The difference may appear academic on the
surface, but it affects your portfolio — especially when it comes time to pay
your taxes (see Chapter 8). Which distribution is which, and why do the
funds start sending you checks like grandma on your birthday? Read on to
find out!
Income
Income is money generated from interest, dividends, rental payments, and
similar sources. Hedge funds usually reinvest income into their funds, but
sometimes they pay it out to their investors. You may receive a check to help
you meet your tax obligations, or your fund may send it to manage the size of
its investable assets.
132
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

Whether or not you receive income checks, you have to pay taxes on the
income and capital gains realized by your fund during the year (see 
Chapter 8). Your fund manager may give you guidance on your estimated lia-
bility as the year progresses.
You can do whatever you want with the money that you receive (after taxes).
You can use it to meet spending obligations, or you can reinvest it elsewhere;
it all depends on your portfolio objectives.
Returns of capital
Capital gains are profits made when an investment goes up in price. These
gains are paper gains when the fund still holds the asset that goes up in price,
and realized gains when the fund sells the asset, locking in the profit in the
process. Realized gains are taxable, but paper gains are not. In most cases,
hedge funds want to reinvest their capital gains into new investments.
Your hedge fund may send you a check for your capital gains, reducing the
amount of principal in the fund. If the fund manager doesn’t see great invest-
ment opportunities in the market that would meet the fund’s desired risk and
return profile, he may want to whittle the fund’s size down to something
more likely to generate big profits given the current market climate. Sure, the
fund manager is giving up the asset-management fee by returning the capital
gains, but he’s also increasing the potential size of the profit bonus.
You may think that income and capital gains are the same thing, but they
aren’t. The government taxes them at different rates, and people handle them
differently for accounting purposes. In most cases, capital gains are taxed at
lower rates than income, which is enough of a reason to keep them separated.
A return calculation has two parts: the dollar amount of the profit, and the
dollar amount of the underlying principal. A $100,000 gain represents a 10-
percent return on $1,000,000 in principal, for example, but it’s only a 1-percent
return on $10,000,000 in principal. The larger the fund gets, the harder it is to
generate enough dollar return to represent big percentage return. Therefore, a
hedge fund manager may have an incentive to reduce the amount of principal
in his or her fund in order to increase the percentage return reported.
Managers of top-performing funds have been known to kick investors out. It
sometimes happens when relationship issues arise between the manager and
the investor. After all, a hedge fund is a partnership, and sometimes partners
don’t get along. The offering documents that you sign when you enter the
fund explain if and when the fund manager can do this. The policy may screw
up your portfolio, and all the paper gains will suddenly fall into the realized
(taxable) category.
133
Chapter 7: You Want Your Money When? Balancing Time and Liquidity

Moving on after disbandment
One final factor can affect your investment objectives after you enter into a
hedge fund: the life of the fund. For many reasons — mostly related to poor
performance — a fund manager may decide to disband the fund and return
the money to investors.
Hedge Fund Research, a hedge-fund-performance analysis firm (www.
hedgefundresearch.com), reports that 11.4 percent of the hedge funds 
in its 9,000-fund database shut their doors in 2005, the highest rate recorded.
For funds of funds, which are investment pools that place money in several
different hedge funds (see Chapter 15), the liquidation rate was 9.4 percent.
The rate of abandonment also increased from 2004, when 4.7 percent of
hedge funds closed.
When your fund disbands because of poor performance, you’re happy to get
your money back. But poor performance isn’t the only culprit. A fund may
have a new manager who realizes that it can be hard to raise enough money
and earn enough of a return to make the venture worthwhile.
However, there are two main problems with fund abandonment:
 Poor performance may be a temporary blip. A given investment strat-
egy may be having an off year, which actually presents a good opportu-
nity to buy assets cheap in order to take advantage of better perform-
ance in the near future. If the fund closes, though, its investors lose the
opportunity to buy low in order to sell high. This is one reason that
funds like having as long a lockup period as possible.
 It may not be easy for a fund investor to find a new investment that
meets his or her risk-and-return needs. The likelihood of you finding
another suitable investment is called reinvestment risk. Based on Hedge
Fund Research’s 2005 numbers, your chances may be running at about
10 percent or so.
If disbandment looks like a possibility for your fund, you really can’t do any-
thing except start looking for new places to put your money. Disbandment is
one of the risks you take when you invest in hedge funds.

Taxes, Responsibilities, and Other

 Investing with a social conscience
I
nvestors face all sorts of constraints when setting investment objectives
and choosing hedge funds and other investment vehicles to meet them. In
Chapter 7, I cover time and liquidity considerations. In this chapter, I cover
some constraints that aren’t set by the hedge fund manager, but by regula-
tors and others outside of the fund, including taxes, fiduciary responsibili-
ties, and social restrictions, to name a few. If you want to put your money into
a hedge fund, you need to know what your requirements are or you’ll run into
big problems. For example, many hedge funds follow strategies that generate
both high returns and high tax liabilities. These funds may be appropriate
only for pensions, foundations, and other investment groups that aren’t sub-
ject to the taxman.
You aren’t in the fight alone, however; your hedge fund manager has to deal
with these constraints as well. No matter how the fund is regulated, its man-
ager has certain responsibilities to meet. Understanding the constraints
faced by certain types of fund investors can help the fund manager create
and market new hedge funds that meet investors’ needs.

Taxing You, the Hedge Fund Investor
(Hey, It’s Better than Death!)
Hedge fund investment returns come in two forms: capital gains and income.
A capital gain is the increase in value an asset experiences over time. Income
includes interest, dividends, or rent — in other words, any ongoing payments
made to the investor. You may not care about the classification of your return,
as long as you make money, but you need to care that the U.S. tax code treats
these returns differently. (I discuss capital gains and income in more detail
later in this section, and you can check out Chapter 7 for even more detail.)
No matter your form of return, the hedge fund you’re in must have an invest-
ment strategy to produce the return, and different investment techniques
have different tax effects. Some hedge-fund strategies make great money, but
not after the fund pays taxes. If you have to pay taxes, you need to make sure
your hedge fund is managed with that responsibility in mind. This section
covers how tax considerations can (and should) affect your choice of a hedge
fund, or whether you can buy into a hedge fund in the first place. (Chapter 4
discusses the paperwork involved in buying into a hedge fund, much of
which is related to taxes.)
You may have to pay taxes on your share of your hedge fund’s income and
capital gains each year, whether you take any money out of the fund or not.
After all, you are considered to be a partner in the business; alas, responsibil-
ity comes with a cool title (see Chapter 1). Talk to your tax advisor for more
information.
You aren’t done after the Feds get their cut; your state probably wants a
share of your profit, too, and the city or country where you live may also take
a piece of your investment profits. There are too many state considerations
to cover in this book; just make sure you look into it, for your own sake.
Making sense of capital-gains taxes
A capital gain is the increase in value of an asset over time. If you buy a share
of stock at $10, hold it while the company introduces great new products and
generates tons of profits, and then sell it after the stock reaches $52, you have
a capital gain of $42. You don’t pay taxes until you sell the asset. Your basis is
the price you paid to acquire the asset, and your gain is the price you sell it
at less the basis.
136
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

Capital gains are classified as short term or long term, based on how long
you hold your investment. Long-term capital gains come from assets that you
hold for more than one year, and short-term capital gains come from assets
that you hold for one year or less. You can net capital gains against capital
losses. If you lose money when you sell one investment, you can deduct that
loss (up to $3,000) against a gain incurred when you sell another. If you have
more than $3,000 in losses, you can carry the extra into next year and deduct
it then. You can also net any short-term capital losses against long-term capi-
tal gains, which may reduce your liability.
The advantage of capital gains is that the government taxes them at a lower
rate than income (see the following section). If you have to pay taxes, 28 
percent — the maximum rate on capital gains as of press time — is less than
35 percent — the current maximum rate on income. In addition, long-term
capital gains — on assets held for more than one year — are taxed at lower
rates than short-term capital gains.
Most hedge funds generate at least some returns from capital gains. Investors
in a hedge fund are expected to pay taxes on those gains each year out of other
sources of funds, because the fund manager probably won’t distribute money
to investors so they can pay the taxes. (You can read more about hedge fund
distributions and withdrawals in Chapter 7.) If a hedge fund gets almost all its
returns from short-term capital gains, the tax burden will be higher than with a
fund that gets almost all its returns from long-term capital gains.
Tax laws change every year. Be sure to check the IRS’s latest guidance on
investment tax issues, because this book may be out of date when you do
your taxes in the future. Don’t think that I’m going into an audit with you! The
IRS Web site, www.irs.gov, is a great source of information.
Taxing ordinary income
Many investment gains are classified as ordinary income. Income is money
that an asset generates on a regular basis — for example, interest on a bond,
dividends on common stock, or rent from a commercial real estate stake. You
report this income on your taxes, and you pay the same rate on it that you
pay on earned income from your job. The good news? You can deduct any
investment interest you pay, such as interest paid in leveraging or short-
selling strategies. (See Chapter 11 for more information on leveraging and
short-selling.)
137
Chapter 8: Taxes, Responsibilities, and Other Investment Considerations

The government taxes dividends, or payouts of company profits, at a lower
rate than other investment income because the company that issues the divi-
dend has already paid taxes on its profits before it issues the dividend out of
what’s left over. Many companies pay their shareholders small amounts of
money out of their profits each year. In 2005, for example, Johnson & Johnson
shareholders received $1.32 in dividends for each share owned. The maxi-
mum tax rate on dividend income as of this writing is 15 percent.
A hedge fund that generates much of its return from interest income carries a
higher tax burden than one that generates return from dividend income or
from long-term capital gains (see the previous section).
On occasion, a hotshot trader makes an investment that generates tons of
money, only to find come April 15 that the earnings are classified as income
and the expenses are classified as capital losses. With no expenses to deduct,
the investor finds that the taxes more than offset the realized profit. This situ-
ation is rare, but it happens. Allow me to illustrate. The following table shows
the pre-tax profit on this investor’s initial investment:
Initial investment
$1,500
Ending value
$2,000
Pre-tax profit
$500
The $500 represents the ending value of the investment less the initial invest-
ment. The next table shows how the taxes affect the investment’s profit, less
income taxes due, when the costs are capital and the profits are income:
Profit for tax purposes
$2,000 (1,500 cost disallowed)
Income taxes due at 33% rate
$660
Realized profit
–$160
How do you avoid this situation? If an investment is subject to income taxes,
your best bet is to work with a hedge fund manager who has enough experi-
ence to understand the tax implications of different trading strategies. Because
taxes can eat into an investment return, hedge fund investors who pay taxes
should ask potential hedge fund managers about the tax implications of their
funds’ investment strategies.
Exercising your right to be exempt
With all these crazy tax implications, it’s a wonder anyone invests in hedge
funds. Think about it — you could have to pay huge amounts in taxes each
138
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

year on money that the fund locks up for two years. Who would do that? A
tax-exempt investor would. But doesn’t everyone pay taxes? No. Two primary
types of investors don’t pay taxes:
 Qualified retirement and pension plans
 Bona-fide charitable foundations and endowments
Not surprisingly, these groups are among the biggest investors in hedge
funds. It doesn’t hurt that they often have a lot of money, a long-term invest-
ment horizon, and that they don’t have to worry about income and capital-
gain tradeoffs because of their exempt status. The following sections dig a bit
deeper into the workings of these organizations.
Tax-exempt investors have to meet stringent IRS requirements and possibly
other standards to retain their status. If you’re responsible for choosing any
investment options for a qualified tax-exempt investment fund, talk to a
lawyer to make sure you don’t make a mistake that could have your founda-
tion or endowment writing a big check come April 15. I doubt your organiza-
tion will be as charitable with your position, in that case!
Identifying qualified plans
A qualified plan is a pension plan that meets certain IRS provisions. Among
other things, the plan has to benefit all employees, not just a few highly paid
workers.
There are two types of qualified plans:
 Defined benefit plans: The employer agrees to pay the employee a set
monthly amount upon retirement, based on the years that the employee
worked and the income that he or she earned. The defined benefit plan
is a traditional pension fund, and it’s becoming rare. You most often see
this plan offered by large, unionized employers, who often invest in
hedge funds for their plans.
 Defined contribution plans: The employee sets aside some money from
each paycheck and determines where he or she wants to invest it. The
employer may match some of the employee’s contribution. A familiar
example is a 401(k) plan.
Defined contribution plans don’t invest in hedge funds, because no
employee’s annual contribution would be large enough to meet a hedge
fund’s initial investment requirements.
139
Chapter 8: Taxes, Responsibilities, and Other Investment Considerations

If a plan meets the qualification rules, an employer can deduct contributions
made to the plan from its taxes, and the employee pays no tax until the
money is withdrawn. Investment returns on the plan assets aren’t taxed.
Getting the gist of foundations and endowments
Nonprofit institutions, such as foundations or endowments, are often sup-
ported by large pools of money that generate annual investment income used
to support the organizations’ work. In some cases, the amounts of money
involved are huge. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, has
$28.8 billion in assets as of press time, and Harvard University, where Bill
Gates was enrolled before he dropped out to start his own company, sits on
$25.9 billion. Most foundations are quite a bit smaller, however.
A foundation is set by a wealthy individual or a company. Charitable organiza-
tions that need money for activities send grant applications to foundations,
explaining how they plan to use the money to support the foundations’ goals.
Examples include the Ford Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation, both of which provide support for a wide range of
endeavors.
An endowment is a pool of money that the charitable organization controls
itself. Endowments can be quite small — my church has an endowment of
about $300,000, for example — or they can be on the scale of Yale’s $15.2 bil-
lion or Harvard’s $25.9 billion.
Donations made to foundations and endowments are usually deductible from
income taxes. The investment income earned by the organizations is also tax-
free as long as they meet certain requirements. Foundations, for example,
must distribute 5 percent of their assets each year. Some very large founda-
tions eschew hedge funds because they don’t want to risk a large return.
Sounds crazy, huh? They want to give money to charities for responsible use,
but they don’t want the charities to have so much money that they give it
away to wasteful projects.
140
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 
Free money here! Just read!
Okay, so this advice doesn’t pertain to hedge
funds, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t share this
simple financial trick. If your employer operates
a 401(k) or other defined contribution fund, and
the employer matches your contribution, be sure
you set aside at least as much money each year
as the company will match. If your employer
matches the first $1,000 that you contribute, your
$1,000 contribution automatically doubles. That’s
free money! You can’t beat that with any invest-
ment, in a hedge fund or elsewhere.

Larger endowments, on the other hand, often turn to hedge funds because
they can afford to lock up large sums of money for two years; they don’t have
to worry about taxes; and they appreciate the increased return relative to the
risk taken. If you’re making investment decisions for a foundation or an
endowment — especially one with more than $5 million in assets — you
should at least consider hedge funds. That’s what this book is all about!
Figuring Out Your Fiduciary
Responsibility
If you’re responsible for managing money for another person or an organiza-
tion, you take on a fiduciary responsibility. You’re responsible for acting in the
best interests of the person (or organization) who owns the money. The exact
141
Chapter 8: Taxes, Responsibilities, and Other Investment Considerations
Can you invest your IRA in hedge funds?
“Aha!” you say. You have the answer to the tax
problem for an individual investor: Just invest
in hedge funds through an IRA (an Individual
Retirement Account, which gives income tax
advantages to the account holder)! That way,
all the taxes are deferred until withdrawal, and
the tax problem goes away.
If only it were that simple. The first flaw in this
plan is that an individual investor is unlikely to
have enough money in a retirement account to
put in a hedge fund. After all, many funds
require that investors put in $1 million or more
(see Chapter 2). Even hedge funds that take
smaller amounts of money usually ask investors
to put in a minimum of $50,000. Still, an individ-
ual with a substantial rollover from a 401(k) or
executive deferred compensation plan — a
type of employee benefit that puts bonus money
into a retirement plan — may be able to meet a
hedge fund’s high minimum investment.
The next snag is that in order to put the IRA into
a hedge fund, it has to be set up as a self-directed
IRA (an IRA account that the owner manages
instead of assigning the management to a mutual
fund or other organization). Most banks and bro-
kerage firms can handle the paperwork for this
structure because IRAs are set up as trust
accounts; however, very few hedge funds, if any,
want to operate a trust business.
So, the biggest question is, will a hedge fund
want your retirement account? A fund runs into
some obstacles when it comes to handling
retirement accounts. A hedge fund manager
who handles retirement funds has to file with the
U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees retire-
ment accounts. A fund manager can’t invest IRA
accounts in some asset classes, such as metals
and gems. Finally, a fund must price retirement
accounts monthly, which may be difficult for a
hedge fund holding many illiquid securities
(securities that don’t trade often and thus may
not have an easily determined value).

description of how a fiduciary should act varies with the type of account
involved. A pension fund manager has to meet different fiduciary duties than
a trust account manager, for example.
People involved in the selection and administration of funds also have fidu-
ciary responsibilities. If your job involves mailing out statements to employ-
ees who participate in a pension plan, fiduciary responsibilities and laws
affect you. If you make the decision to put a pension or an endowment into a
hedge fund, these responsibilities and laws definitely affect you. Your fidu-
ciary responsibilities form a key constraint on your decision of whether to
invest in hedge funds in the first place, let alone which one. And if you do
invest in hedge funds, your fiduciary responsibilities affect how you monitor
your investment.
As a fiduciary, you must employ the following characteristics:
 Care: By applying skills, knowledge, and insight.
 Discretion: By protecting the client’s confidentiality.
 Impartiality: By treating all clients and beneficiaries the same.
 Loyalty: To serve the beneficiary.
 Prudence: By behaving appropriately to preserve investment capital.
I discuss some of the big concepts — and big governing laws — in this sec-
tion. If you have any questions about what laws cover your responsibilities or
how to follow these laws, you may need to consult a lawyer and an invest-
ment consultant (see Chapter 17) — the courts take fiduciary responsibilities
seriously, and so should you.
Coming to terms with common law
Allow me to start the discussion of fiduciary responsibility by giving you
some information on how fiduciary responsibilities have evolved over time.
Legal standards that are based on court decisions rather than on laws passed
by elected representatives are called common laws. Fiduciary responsibility
developed in the common law before legislators started writing laws about
the investment business. And, in general, the courts look down upon money
managers and advisors who take advantage of their clients.
The foundation of fiduciary responsibility in U.S. law is the so-called prudent
person rule, which Judge Samuel Putnam first laid out in an 1830 court ruling:
“All that can be required of a trustee to invest, is, that he shall conduct him-
self faithfully and exercise a sound discretion. He is to observe how men of
142
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

prudence, discretion, and intelligence manage their own affairs, not in regard
to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, con-
sidering the probable income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to
be invested.”
The problem with the prudent person rule is that the court didn’t set out the
qualifications and behavior in checklist form. Instead, Judge Putnam assumed
that you would know a prudent person when you meet one, but your idea of
prudence may be very different from mine. Furthermore, he established a
standard that preservation of the initial investment (also called capital or prin-
cipal) is more important than investment return, which isn’t always the case.
What’s the difference between a prudent person and a prudent expert? Here’s
something to chew on. My sister-in-law is a smart woman who teaches first
grade. She has the responsibility of teaching 24 kids to read and do math in a
safe, supportive environment. You don’t get much more prudent than that. If
you hand her $20,000,000 in pension-plan assets and tell her that she must
manage that money, she may turn it over to a bank and put it in certificates of
deposit (CDs) because she doesn’t know what else to do; she isn’t a financial
expert. Bank CDs are safe investments, so she has met the prudent person
standard. The situation is different if you decide to give the $20,000,000 in
pension assets to a fancy portfolio manager with 15 years of experience, sev-
eral degrees from brand-name colleges, and plenty of initials after his name. If
he puts it in bank CDs because he doesn’t know what else to do with the
money, he violates the prudent expert standard. (Note: Bank CDs may be a
good investment for a pension plan, given market conditions and the plan’s
needs, but the decision to go this route should be an active one, not a default
choice.)
Tackling trust law
A trust is a complex legal relationship in which one person or legal entity
gives money to another person to manage for the benefit of a third party.
People can set up trusts for plenty of reasons, but many individuals use them
for estate planning. By having a trust inherit assets rather than a person, you
can avoid some estate taxes. You can avoid other problems, too: A trust may
stipulate that a minor can have only a small part of her inheritance until she
reaches a certain age, thus preventing her from running amok with too much
money and too little control.
Persons managing larger trusts may sometimes invest in hedge funds, so
trust laws apply to their investments. Each state is unique, but most trust
laws have a few things in common:
143
Chapter 8: Taxes, Responsibilities, and Other Investment Considerations

 The trustee, who has responsibility for the trust, must act as a prudent
person, not necessarily as a prudent expert (see the previous section).
 The trustee’s primary responsibility is preservation of the initial investment.
 The person who sets up the trust may create restrictions that would be
difficult for the trustee or the beneficiary to change.
People who run pension and retirement accounts, charitable foundations,
and university endowments often set them up as trust accounts; however,
these investments are governed by different laws based on trust laws, but
designed to meet the specific needs of those funds. You can read more about
these laws throughout this section.
Uniform Management of Institutional
Funds Act (UMIFA)
Over the years, each state has passed its own fiduciary standards, which 
led to a hodgepodge of contradictory rules within the United States. Finally,
between 1972 and 1984, most states adopted the Uniform Management of
Institutional Funds Act (UMIFA), a standard law that regulates the manage-
ment of charity and endowment funds. UMIFA is enforced on the state level,
but the standardization makes it easy for money managers and the people
who hire them to follow the rules. A charity or endowment that wants to
invest in hedge funds must heed the guidance of the UMIFA.
UMIFA says that investors handling the affairs of charity and endowment
funds must follow standards of business care and prudence. UMIFA fiducia-
ries don’t have to be investment experts, only prudent persons. The assump-
tion is that the fiduciary acted properly, so if an accuser presents allegations
of impropriety, the burden of proof falls on the accuser.
UMIFA stipulates that an investor should invest funds at reasonable risk for
reasonable return. UMIFA leaves the key word, “reasonable,” undefined. What
the investor needs to know is that she can lose some of the initial investment
and still be acting prudently if she has evidence of a long-run strategy that
meets the charity or endowment’s needs (see Chapters 7 and 8 for more on
investment objectives; you can discover more about investment strategy in
the chapters of Part III).

Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act (ERISA) of 1972
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1972 is one of the most
powerful pieces of federal legislation in the investment world. Because
“Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1972” is a mouthful, people
almost always refer to the law by its nickname, ERISA (rhymes with “Alyssa”).
Legislators wrote ERISA to regulate pensions, but it applies to many other
types of employee benefits. ERISA says that a fiduciary is anyone who exer-
cises control over any portion of the pension plan. The law holds fiduciaries
to a prudent expert standard, meaning that each person in a fiduciary role
must have the education, experience, and training to meet his or her assigned
responsibilities (see the section “Coming to terms with common law” for
more on prudent experts). The U.S. Department of Labor handles ERISA
enforcement.
Under ERISA, a pension plan’s fiduciaries must act in the best interests of the
plan’s beneficiaries. Confusion can sometimes arise within a company, as it’s
usually the company that sponsors the pension plan for its employees that
makes decisions about how to invest the money. Those decisions can’t bene-
fit the company; they have to benefit the employees who will receive the pen-
sion when they retire.
If an accuser brings forth allegations of fiduciary irresponsibility, the burden
of proof falls on the fiduciary, not on the accuser. This is a higher standard
than in other fiduciary laws (such as UMIFA).
Plans that fall under ERISA, which is almost all pension plans and many other
employee benefit plans, must have written investment plans calling for diver-
sified portfolios. An ERISA plan can take investment risks that may result in
short-term losses as long as the plan meets its long-run investment policy
and the fund considers its portfolio as a whole rather than any particular
plan. That second requirement is tough for some hedge funds to meet,
because they may not report performance frequently enough to meet fidu-
ciary responsibilities. The pension plan’s fiduciaries must evaluate and
report on the pension’s investment performance on a regular basis, a stan-
dard that may be difficult for some hedge funds to meet.
ERISA plans can invest in hedge funds, and many of them do. But not all
hedge funds are willing to take ERISA plans because the fund managers must
also follow the requirements of the law.

Transparency in Hedge 
Funds: Rare but There
Hedge funds are like undercover cops: They don’t like to talk about what they
do. You can attribute their preference for mystery to a few reasons. They’re
organized as private partnerships (see Chapter 2); they may not be registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (see Chapter 3); and they may
have figured out proprietary strategies to take advantage of market inefficien-
cies (see Chapter 6). If they tell the world what they’re doing, they risk losing
their little money-making secrets.
However, you have legitimate reasons to know what’s happening in the fund.
Not only are you putting your money at risk, but also you may need to report
to others or certify that you’ve met your fiduciary responsibilities if you work
with an endowment or charitable organization, for example (see the section
“Figuring Out Your Fiduciary Responsibility”). If you have fiduciary responsibil-
ities, transparency — or the lack of it — may affect your ability to do your job.
In this section, I discuss position transparency, risk transparency, and
window dressing and how they affect fiduciary responsibility — a considera-
tion when choosing whether to invest in hedge funds or which hedge funds
to invest in. (In Chapter 9, I discuss how transparency can affect asset alloca-
tion decisions, which are the choices you make about how to divide your
money among different types of securities.)
Reports of a hedge fund’s holdings should come from a prime brokerage firm —
a firm that handles the hedge fund’s trading account — and a bona-fide account-
ing firm should audit the reports. One recent hedge fund investigation found
that a fund’s shareholders hadn’t received a report for two years (one tip off of
trouble), and when they finally saw a partial report of holdings, it was a state-
ment from a discount brokerage firm — a fine company, but not one that han-
dles prime brokerage services for hedge funds. If you find out that a hedge fund
doesn’t have an audited financial statement and doesn’t work through a prime
broker (see Chapter 18 for more on due diligence), you shouldn’t invest in it.
Appraising positions
When a hedge fund releases a list of the investments it owns, it has position
transparency. You can look at the list to see what stocks sit in the account,
what bonds the fund holds, what currencies it’s exposed to, and other infor-
mation. You can combine this information with any other holdings you have
(see Chapter 9 for more information on structuring your portfolio) to ensure
146
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

that the fund is meeting your overall investment risk and return objectives.
Position transparency can also show if the fund is complying with any unique
requirements that you may have.
Many hedge funds refuse to release information on their positions out of con-
cern that others could use the info against them. For example, if news breaks
that a big hedge fund has a large short position in a particular stock (that is, it
has borrowed the stock and sold it in hopes that it will go down in price), other
funds may do a short squeeze, bidding up the price of the stock or calling back
any stock that their prime brokers may have lent out to other investors. Such a
squeeze would force the hedge fund to close the short position at a loss.
Many hedge funds give position information to investors who need it to fulfill
their fiduciary responsibilities; however, the funds may make the recipients
sign confidentiality agreements. The agreement ensures that a pension fund’s
trustees have enough information to see that the hedge fund is behaving as a
prudent expert and in line with the pension’s investment objectives, but it
prevents the trustees from giving copies of the fund’s investments to employ-
ees covered by the pension plan. A hedge fund manager knows if an investor
has fiduciary responsibilities because the investor has to tell the manager
before making the investment.
Interpreting risk
By using tactics such as leverage (or borrowing, which I discuss in Chapter
11) and agreements such as derivatives (contracts based on the value of an
underlying asset; see Chapter 5), a hedge fund may present a different risk
level than its holdings list indicates (see the previous section). The risk may
be more or less than the investor realizes.
The bad news is that you don’t have an easy way to measure the amount of
risk in a hedge fund. You can blame it on the fact that risk isn’t well defined in
finance, despite Nobel Prizes going to men who have done years of research
on the subject. Under the Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory (discussed
in great detail in Chapter 6), risk is based on the standard deviation of return.
Risk measures the likelihood of an investment netting any return other than
the return you expect. Most investors wouldn’t consider getting a greater-
than-expected return to be risky, but it is in theory.
Most investors consider the likelihood of loss to be risky, but likelihood is a
lot harder to measure. Some hedge fund managers simply refuse to give
investors information on risk, saying that the information is proprietary. But
most hedge funds try to give their investors some information that they can
use, and if you need to know the risk of the hedge fund that you’re investing
147
Chapter 8: Taxes, Responsibilities, and Other Investment Considerations

in, you should deal only with funds that give you risk information. A common
measurement is Value at Risk (VAR), a single number that gives the likelihood
of the portfolio losing a set amount of money over a set period (say, 10 days).
One problem with Value at Risk is that the likelihood will never be zero.
Another is that the hedge fund manager may give you information on Value at
Risk at a given point in time, but that number can change rapidly as market
conditions change.
Another technique that some portfolio managers use is stress testing, where
they run computer models to find out how a hedge fund’s portfolio might per-
form in different economic conditions. What would happen to the portfolio if
inflation increases dramatically, or if the government of Thailand collapses,
or if the euro falls apart? The results of stress testing give you some parame-
ters to use in determining how much risk an investment has. Keep in mind,
however, that stress testing can’t test for every possible event. Martians
could take over the earth tomorrow — why not? — and you can bet that no
one has done a stress test for that.
Avoiding window dressing
Hedge funds rarely give transparency in real time. A hedge fund won’t tell
anyone what’s happening on any particular day. Some hedge fund managers
take advantage of this position to make their portfolios look good on the days
that they must report. This tactic is known in the investing world as window
dressing.
For example, say that a hedge fund handles many government pension and
university endowment accounts. The trustees for these accounts have made
it clear that fund can’t invest their money in Sudan, and they want to see a
list of positions every six months. One day, the hedge fund manager sees
some great opportunities in bonds that will finance an oil project in Sudan.
She ignores the accounts’ wishes and buys the bonds, and then she sells
them the day before she has to report her fund’s holdings.
A less-nefarious, and far more common, form of window dressing takes place
when a hedge fund manager sells all the positions that turned out to be bad
ideas right before the reporting date.
Activists and opponents in 
the hedge fund world
Not surprisingly, everyone who looks at hedge funds doesn’t appreciate the
limits on transparency. Some activists groups have formed to demand more
148
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

information on how hedge funds are investing. Students and faculty at Yale
University formed one group, Unfarallon (www.unfarallon.info), to
protest the institution’s investment in hedge funds managed by Farallon
Capital Management. Those who formed the group aren’t opposed to hedge
funds, per se, but they think that an institution of higher education has a
responsibility to make its investments known to its stakeholders.
Unfarallon isn’t the only group out there. Trade unions, charitable donors,
elected officials, and others who have a say in money that ends up in hedge
funds often want more information about how those funds invest their money.
To date, no hedge-fund investments have stopped because of activism, but
that could change, so keep an eye out for it. If you’re handling money that has
politically active stakeholders, like students or union members, this may
affect you.
Practicing Socially Responsible Investing
Some investors prefer to put their money into investments that reflect their
social values. One person may not want to have any holdings in tobacco com-
panies, and another may not want any investments involving pornography.
For other investors, social responsibility isn’t a preference, it’s a constraint
put into the law. For example, a government pension may not be allowed to
invest in companies doing business in Myanmar or the Sudan; anyone allocat-
ing that pension’s money to a hedge fund has to be aware of that policy.
And for a unique set of investors, the law is set by a higher authority than
any government. A strict Muslim, for example, has to place investments in
accordance with the laws of the Muslim faith. A Muslim investor would no
more borrow money than eat pork, for example (see sidebar in this section
for more on this topic).
Although the fast-paced, wheelie-dealie world of a typical hedge fund may seem
antithetical to any calling except making money, money, and more money, sev-
eral hedge funds are addressing the preferences of different groups of investors.
You can find many funds that are managed to respect the beliefs of Roman
Catholics, Mormons, or environmentalists, to name a few. Hedge funds that
work with government pension funds, university endowments, and charitable
foundations have experience in dealing with constraints placed on those funds.
What’s the worst that could happen if you ask? If a fund can’t respect your par-
ticular limits, it will turn down the investment.

Chapter 8: Taxes, Responsibilities, and Other Investment Considerations

If you want to invest with a social conscious, you should seek out hedge
funds that have similar goals. You can find them through online searches, by
working with investment advisors who understand your needs (see Chapter
17), or by getting advice from others who share your objectives. It’s the same
process that you’d go through in order to find any hedge fund.
Fiduciaries debate whether socially responsible investing is appropriate
because of some evidence that it may lead to a reduced investment return (see
the section “Figuring Out Your Fiduciary Responsibility” for more on the topic).
If you’re a fiduciary, check to make sure that socially responsible investment
decisions are in line with the overall strategy of your fund and that they make
sense from a risk-and-return perspective. Otherwise, you may violate your fidu-
ciary responsibilities, no matter how pure your heart may be.

Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 
Shariah and investing
The Islamic religion has more than a billion adher-
ents in the world, many of whom have money to
invest. The religion’s Shariah laws not only regu-
late diet and dress, but also limit how Muslims
can handle their money. The world’s financial
markets evolved in Judeo-Christian cultures in
Europe and North America, so many common
financial transactions are out of step with
Shariah. Under Fiqh Al-Muamalat — the part of
Shariah that deals with finance — a devout
Muslim must follow some strict regulations:
 No paying interest or engaging in speculation.
 The return on a financial transaction should
be in line with the risk taken, not greater.
 No Muslim should profit from investments
in such prohibited activities as gambling,
drinking, or pork processing.
On a simple level, these prohibitions make it dif-
ficult for a Muslim to buy a house in Western
countries, although the banks are coming around
more these days to meet their needs. Devon
Bank, located on the north side of Chicago in a
neighborhood that’s home to many Pakistani and
Indian immigrants, developed residential real
estate sale-leaseback arrangements that comply
with Shariah laws. People in the neighborhood
who had to avoid mortgages can now buy
houses.
And what about a devout Muslim who has made
millions running a business in Chicago, London,
or Dubai? He may want to put some of his money
into a hedge fund, but the fund has to be compli-
ant with Shariah. Most hedge funds look to gen-
erate a higher level of return for a given level of
risk, which Shariah may consider to be undue
speculation. Also, many hedge funds rely on
leverage and short-selling (see Chapter 11),
which require the payment of interest.
Still, a handful of hedge funds are rising to the
Shariah challenge. These funds are generally
structured as long-short funds that buy shares
of stock in companies expected to do well and
sell borrowed shares of stocks from companies
expected to do poorly (in other words, sell them
short). The funds set up the borrowing as repur-
chase agreements or fee-based arrangements
to get around the interest prohibitions. The
strategy is that the trades themselves don’t
involve excessive risk, so the overall risk-and-
return profiles of the funds are compliant.

Fitting Hedge Funds 
into a Portfolio
In This Chapter
 Allocating assets within a portfolio/fund
 Classifying hedge funds to aid in portfolio structuring
 Reporting hedge funds as overlays
 Matching the proper hedge funds with your portfolio structure
H
edge funds are wildly different from each other. Because hedge funds
are simply lightly regulated investment partnerships — and therefore
can take advantage of more investment strategies than other highly regulated
investment vehicles, such as mutual funds — different funds are bound to
invest in different ways. Some managers design hedge funds to be different
from other types of investments, and others don’t. 
Given the limits of the private partnership structure, like restrictions on with-
drawals and high fees (see Chapter 2), an investment portfolio is rarely made
up entirely of hedge funds. Some investors treat hedge funds as a separate
asset class, and others treat them simply as a different forum to hold and
manage existing assets.
So, do hedge funds fall in a separate asset class or not? How do you fit a
hedge fund into a portfolio? How do you use hedge funds to meet your invest-
ment objectives? You’ve come to the right place for answers. This chapter
looks at how you can include hedge funds in your investment portfolio to
increase your return for a given level of risk.

Assaying Asset Allocations
A real asset is a tangible piece of property that you can own: a factory, a
house, a gold mine, and so on. A financial asset — also called a security — is
a claim on a tangible asset: a piece of paper showing partial ownership of a
factory, a loan to the factory owner or bond holder, rights to a share of the
production of a mine, and so on. 
Different assets have different sources of return and present different tradeoffs,
and you want a balance of them in your portfolio. I summarize many types of
financial assets in Table 9-1 (see Chapter 5 for more details on these assets).

The chapters of Part III cover the different types of hedge funds and hedge-
fund strategies to give you a sense of how they fall on this matrix. Different
fund managers have their own techniques for managing risk and return that
make the profiles of their funds different than you may think by looking at the
holdings.
When choosing a hedge fund (whose manager chooses assets to invest in) to
fit into your portfolio, you need to think about how it will act with the other
investments in your fund. Will the fund help you reduce risk, increase return,
or both? Will it help you reach your investment goals?
Matching goals to money
Asset allocation is the process of matching your investment goals to your
money in order to meet your goals with the lowest possible amount of risk
152
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

(see Chapters 7 and 8 for more about goals and the upcoming section
“Diversification, risk, and return: How the asset pros and cons play out”). 
Do you need to generate $100,000 in pre-tax annual income from your 
investments? Are current interest rates at 4 percent? If so, you should put
$4,000,000 in fixed-income securities with an average coupon (annual interest
rate) of 4 percent. Do you need $10,000,000 in 20 years to meet a contractual
obligation? Do you think that an 8-percent return is acceptable as long as you
experience little variation between your expected return and the return that
you get? If so, you should put $2.2 million in a hedge fund with an absolute-
return strategy (see the section “Absolute-return funds” later in this chapter).
The exact amounts and investments you choose will vary with your means and
your goals. The other chapters in Part II should help you think about what you
need. Any professional advisors you work with should take the time to find out
what you need, too (see Chapter 17 for info on working with a consultant).
Beware of advisors who try to sell you products without finding out what
your needs are. It’s no only against regulations (a violation of the know-your-
customer and suitability rules), but also bad for you.
Chasing return versus allocating assets
“I don’t care what fund you put me in, as long as it performs well. How about
this fund that was up 40 percent last year?” Whoa, cowboy! Unfortunately,
that’s a common strategy among investors, and it’s a dangerous one. Known
as chasing return, this strategy ignores long-term goals, near-term constraints,
and good investing principles in hopes of landing the big bucks right now. 
Return chasers are doomed to fail in the long run, and often in the short run,
too. Markets move in cycles, so last year’s hot performer will probably cool
off this year. Moving your money around too much leads to plenty of taxes
and commission charges that eat into your investment base. And without a
sense of how much money you really need, when you need it, and with what
degree of certainty you’re operating, you risk choosing investments that miss
your goals by a mile. 
Mathematicians talk about reversion to the mean. In mathematical terms, it
means that if you have a large set of numbers, the more that one number
varies from the average, the more likely that the next number will be closer
to the average. Now look at it in investing terms. If mean performance for an
asset is 10 percent per year, and the asset earns 50 percent this year, chances
are good that next year’s performance will not only be closer to 10 percent,
but also negative so that the mean doesn’t change. Investors who chase
return usually suffer the negative effects of reversion to the mean.

Chapter 9: Fitting Hedge Funds into a Portfolio

Using Hedge Funds as an Asset Class
One of the biggest debates in the hedge-fund world is whether hedge funds
represent a separate, new asset class, or whether they simply represent
another vehicle to manage the traditional asset classes of stocks, bonds, and
cash. The discussion affects the way that people make decisions about their
money, some good and some bad.
Asset classes are distinctly different from each other, with unique risk-and-
return profiles. For example, bonds are loans; the borrower makes regular
interest payments and returns the principal at the end of the loan. Changes in
interest rates and the ability of the borrower to make the payments affect the
bond price. Stocks, on the other hand, are partial shares of ownership in a
company. The company’s profits and prospects affect the price of stocks.
I don’t think that hedge funds deserve to be treated as a separate asset class,
but many reasonable and smart people would disagree with me, so I take this
section to look at the arguments in favor of hedge funds being in a separate
asset class so that you can make the decision for yourself.
The other side of the argument is that hedge funds are managed uniquely, so
they deserve to be thought of as unique assets — even though they’re made
up of other assets. The problem is that a portfolio may take on the wrong bal-
ance of risk and return because it views the hedge-fund investment as an
investment in a diversifying asset, when really the investment may intensify
risks elsewhere in the portfolio. (See the section “Viewing a Hedge Fund as an
Overlay” for more on this side of the argument.)
How hedge funds are assets
The argument for hedge funds representing a unique asset class is rooted in
the fact that many hedge fund managers design their funds to post com-
pletely different risk-and-return profiles than traditional asset classes. The
big idea is that if you have an investment that you design to return, say, 6 per-
cent to 8 percent every year (see Chapter 6 for more) — year in and year out,
regardless of how interest rates fluctuate or how the economy shifts — you
have an investment that’s different from anything else out there. And if your
risk-and-return profile is different, you should put it in a different asset class.
Of course, not all hedge fund managers design their funds to perform differ-
ently from the financial markets. Hedge funds generally fall into two categories:
154
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

 Absolute-return funds 
 Directional funds
The following sections cover these categories in more detail so you can see
how these two broad groupings of hedge funds have distinct risk and return
tradeoffs, helping you narrow the choices for your portfolio. (See Chapter 1
for more on these two types of funds.)
Following the Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory (MPT; see Chapter 6),
you sort out investment return by its source. Most of an investment’s return
comes from its exposure to the market. This exposure to the market is called
beta. Some return may come from the investor’s skill. Return from the
investor’s skill is called alpha. (By the way, many people argue that alpha
doesn’t exist, and that if it does exist, it is as likely to be negative as positive.) 
Absolute-return funds
The goal of an absolute-return fund is to generate a reasonable percentage
return each year, regardless of the state of the financial markets. Absolute
return funds rarely aim to beat the equity indexes; they instead opt to have a
positive return with relatively little risk. These funds are sometimes referred
to as “bond-like investments,” because a bond that the holder maintains to
maturity generates a steady return from the interest, year in and year out. 
Investment reports often list hedge funds as alternative investments or
absolute-return investments, not as hedge funds.
An absolute-return fund has another moniker: a pure-alpha fund. In theory,
the fund manager tries to remove all market risk (in other words, beta risk) in
order to create a fund that doesn’t vary with market performance. If the man-
ager removes all the market risk, the fund’s performance comes entirely from
the manager’s skill, which in academic terms is called alpha.
Many financial types treat absolute-return investments as a separate asset
class, and many hedge fund managers and investors prefer to use the term
absolute-return strategy when they invest in hedge funds. The term “hedge
funds” seems scary and scandal-ridden, they think, although this type of
investment is something else entirely. Of course, much hedging of risk is
required to get a steady, low-risk return (see Chapter 6), so an absolute-
return hedge fund may be the purest example of the genre. 
Although the exact definition of hedge fund is vague, the fund widely acknowl-
edged as the original, run by Alfred Windsor Jones, was structured as an
absolute-return fund. It bought and sold stocks equally in order to have no
market risk (see Chapter 1).
155
Chapter 9: Fitting Hedge Funds into a Portfolio

An absolute-return fund comes with its own set of problems; the following list
outlines two problems with the strategy:
 Determining exactly how to generate a steady target return. Ideally, 
an absolute return fund will choose two or three strategies and move
among them as market conditions change. With this tactic, the risk and
return of the fund will stay steady even as the markets move, without
the fund manager going in too many different directions. But what hap-
pens if the market enters a period where none of the strategies work?
Should the hedge fund manager stick to her guns, or should she try
something else to meet investor expectations — expectations that may
not have been realistic in hindsight?
 Investors may say that they’d be happy with an 8-percent return if they
earn it consistently, but in reality, most investors will be unhappy if the
Dow Jones Industrial Average goes up 25 percent and their hedge fund
investments go up only 8 percent. What this means is that the fund
manager may have an incentive to pursue strategies that will beat the
market but that also change the risk profile of the fund to something
that it wasn’t designed to be. The manager may keep investors happy in
the short run, but she’s no longer operating the fund as one with a
unique risk-and-return profile.
An investment return is a reward for taking risk. The greater the expected
return of the investment, the greater the likelihood that the investment may
return a different amount. As much as all investors would like tons of return
with no risk, you can’t entirely eliminate risk, but you can reduce it through
diversification (see Chapters 6 and 11 for more).
Directional funds
Fund managers design directional hedge funds to return the maximum amount
possible. These funds assume a lot of risk and are sometimes called beta funds
because they maintain some level of market exposure. In fact, a directional fund
manager may even increase market exposure through leverage — by borrowing
money to take an even larger bet on the market than the amount of assets in the
fund (see Chapter 11 for more on leverage). Because directional funds often
have beta exposure, they’re sometimes considered to have equity-like returns.
A directional fund’s return may be disproportionately larger than its risk, but
the risk is still there. These funds can also swing wildly, giving a big return
some years and plummeting big in others. Longer-term investors may not
mind as long as the upward trend is positive. It can be frustrating for the
hedge fund manager, however, because he doesn’t earn his performance fee
when the fund loses money (see Chapters 2 and 4).
156
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

Under the Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory (MPT; see Chapter 6), you
can diversify beta but not alpha. A fund that has beta exposure probably
can’t be its own asset class for this reason. Almost by definition, the beta
exposure means that the fund is part of the same market as other invest-
ments, not standing alone.
Diversification, risk, and return: How 
the asset pros and cons play out
Does it matter if a hedge fund represents its own asset class or not? Yes, it
does, and here’s why: An investor should structure his or her investment
portfolio to reflect the risk and return that he or she needs. If a hedge fund
appears in its own asset class, other assets that the investor selects to offset
the portfolio’s risk and return characteristics need to appear in the portfolio.
After all, some years stocks will be up, and some years bonds will be. A 
diversified portfolio has exposure to both stocks and bonds, in line with the
investor’s preferences, in order to meet the investor’s needs — regardless of
how the market performs. In fact, adding different kinds of assets to a portfo-
lio can reduce risk without affecting expected return (see Chapter 6).
If return is a function of risk, how can adding different assets to your portfo-
lio reduce risk without affecting return? The answer sits in a statistical mea-
sure called correlation. Correlation shows how much two assets move
together. If they move in tandem, the assets are perfectly correlated. If two
assets aren’t perfectly correlated, some of the movement in one offsets the
movement in another. An investment manager can run a computer program
that analyzes the correlations of all her assets under consideration and deter-
mines how much of an investor’s portfolio should be in each in order to gen-
erate the minimum-variance portfolio. This portfolio has less risk — but not
less return — than any of its assets do on their own. See Chapter 6 for more
information.
Here’s a breakdown of what happens when a hedge fund is in its own class
and what happens when it isn’t:
 If a hedge fund is its own asset class, with its own risk-and-return profile,
it can diversify the risks of other assets in the portfolio. For this reason,
many large pension and endowment funds have been putting money into
hedge funds that feature an absolute-return style and listing them as
separate asset classes. 
 If a hedge fund isn’t its own asset class, it increases the risk in the port-
folio. Investors would have to add other assets to offset that risk. For
157
Chapter 9: Fitting Hedge Funds into a Portfolio

this reason, many hedge fund investors don’t break out their invest-
ments in hedge funds; they opt to include them with their domestic
equity or international markets assets when they report their holdings.
Hedge fund managers have a ton of discretion, and they sometimes change
strategies or attempt trades in new areas. You may think you’re buying one
type of fund but end up in something different. Your hedge fund’s investment
agreement may specify limitations, but it may not. You can exit the fund if
you don’t like the new strategy, but only when the lock-up period expires (see
Chapter 2).
Viewing a Hedge Fund as an Overlay
Many investors view hedge funds as an overlay, not as a separate asset allo-
cation. In other words, an investor makes the asset allocation first (see the
section “Assaying Asset Allocations”) and then decides if any of the assets
should be managed by a hedge fund manager or by another type of investor. 
Considering the overlay pros and cons
Investors have two reasons for taking the overlay approach — one good and
one not so good:
 The overlay thumb’s-up: To think about the portfolio’s risk and return
as a whole, acknowledging that a hedge fund will have market exposure
no matter how much the fund manager wants to talk about pure alpha
(see Chapter 6). Overlay lets the investor think about how much expo-
sure the portfolio has to different asset risks instead of placing the risk
elsewhere.
 The overlay thumb’s-down: To deny an investment in a hedge fund. For
every person who wants to invest in a hedge fund, another person is
scared off. This person sees something inherently dangerous and evil
about hedge funds. A charity may be concerned that listing hedge funds,
or even alternative investors, in its annual holdings will scare off donors.
A pension-fund consultant may be concerned that worker representa-
tives on the trustee board will panic if they see hedge funds on the list.
The solution to this fright is to hide the hedge-fund investments, which
isn’t quite honest.
158
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

Just because a portfolio listing doesn’t include hedge funds or absolute-return
strategies among its assets doesn’t mean it has no investments in them. If
you’re analyzing the investments of a large pension or endowment plan and
you don’t see hedge funds listed, chances are good that the fund included
them in another asset class. If you need to know, don’t hesitate to ask.
Investment reporting: An overlay example
The following tables show a few of the ways that organizations can report
investments. The first table shows the investments of a hypothetical charita-
ble endowment:
Investment
Amount
Cash
$5,000,000
U.S. Treasury Bonds Owned Outright
$10,000,000
International Bond Investment
$10,000,000
Shares Donated by Foundation’s Founder
$20,000,000
Equity Index Fund Investment
$30,000,000
Real Estate Holdings
$3,000,000
Macro Hedge-Fund Investment
$1,000,000
Absolute Return Hedge-Fund Investment
$1,000,000
Total
$80,000,000
The following table shows the reports of the charitable endowment with the
hedge-fund investment broken out:
Cash
$5,000,000
Fixed Income
$20,000,000
Equities
$50,000,000
Alternative Investments
$4,000,000
Absolute Return
$1,000,000
Total
$80,000,000
And this final table shows the reports of the charitable endowment with the
hedge fund as an overlay:
159
Chapter 9: Fitting Hedge Funds into a Portfolio

Cash
$5,000,000
Fixed Income
$20,000,000
Equities
$52,000,000
Real Estate
$3,000,000
Total
$80,000,000
The cash portion in the previous tables is straightforward. The fixed-income
investments, which include U.S. treasury bonds and international bonds, are 
also straightforward. However, things start to get complicated in the other 
asset groups. This endowment holds a lot of stock in one company, which isn’t
unusual in a charitable endeavor, where the founder is sometimes an entrepre-
neur who wants to turn his stake in the business over to charity. For example,
the Milton Hershey School Trust owns 33 percent of The Hershey Company; the
chocolate company’s founder used his fortune to establish a school for orphans. 
Our hypothetical endowment also has money in an index fund, which is an
investment designed to match the performance of a stock index, like the
Standard & Poor’s 500 (www.standardandpoors.com), by investing in all
the companies in the index. 
Next come the alternative investments, added to the portfolio to bring differ-
ent risk-and-return characteristics than those of the classic assets — stocks,
bonds, and cash. Real estate is a common alternative asset. The charity also
has money in two different hedge funds — a macro fund designed to profit
from changes in the global economy and an absolute return fund that should
generate a steady, low-risk return regardless of market conditions.
Here’s how the charity has decided to list the holdings:
 First grouping: The charity’s trustees list the holdings by name. 
However, the trustees may not want to be that exact, for all kinds of rea-
sons. For example, the hedge fund manager may not even give them a
detailed holdings list with that information. So, their next option is to
report the charity’s holdings by asset class, handling the hedge funds as
alternatives to the stocks, bonds, and cash. 
 Second grouping: The charity’s trustees have decided to treat the macro
hedge fund as an alternative asset class, so they add it to the real estate
holding in the investment report (see Chapter 13 for more on macro
funds). They then put the absolute-return fund on a separate line, with the
idea that it represents something different from any of the other assets.
160
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

 Third grouping: The trustees have lumped the hedge-fund investments
into equity holdings, using the logic that the funds have a risk-and-return
profile that’s more like an equity investment than cash, fixed income, or
real estate. 
Mixing and Matching Your Funds
When you determine that a hedge fund is right for you (which is the aim of
the chapters in Part II, of which this is one), you should take two more steps
before you make your investment. First, you need to figure out how much of
your portfolio you should put in a hedge fund. Next, you need to determine
what types of hedge funds are most likely to help you meet your investment
objectives (see Chapters 7 and 8).
One key characteristic of hedge funds is that they’re illiquid (see Chapter 7).
Most hedge fund managers limit how often investors can take their money
out; a fund may lock in investors for two years or more. For this reason alone,
hedge funds are seldom appropriate for an entire investment portfolio. In
almost all cases, hedge funds offer their maximum portfolio benefit in rela-
tively small doses.
But how big or how small an allocation is right for you? The following sec-
tions look to help you out (along with the section “Assaying Asset
Allocations” earlier in this chapter).
Looking for excess capital 
under the couch cushions
Hedge funds are mostly designed as investment vehicles for excess capital —
money that the investor doesn’t need now and doesn’t need to support near-
term spending.
Suppose, for example, that you’re in charge of making investment decisions
for a trust fund worth $20 million. You need to generate $600,000 in annual
income. In most cases, a 5-percent income is reasonable for a minimum long-
term return assumption for a mixed stock and bond portfolio. So, you start
with the $600,000 income need and divide it by 5 percent to determine how
much of the portfolio you should put in stocks and bonds. The answer: $12
million. The remaining amount of the portfolio is considered excess capital.
You can lock up and invest this money at a higher risk level than the rest 
of the portfolio because you don’t need it to support your income needs.
161
Chapter 9: Fitting Hedge Funds into a Portfolio

Although you don’t want to lose that money, losing it wouldn’t affect the min-
imum portfolio objective of generating $600,000 in annual income.
You may not need to generate income right now, but that doesn’t mean you
should lock all your money away in hedge funds. Instead, you should start by
figuring out when you’ll need that money and what you’ll need it for.
Suppose that you’re a professional athlete earning $20 million per year
through a combination of salary and endorsements. You don’t need to spend
all $20 million; in fact, you’re able to spend only about $3 million of it this
year maintaining your current lifestyle. After you spend 3 of the $20 million
that you earned, you have $17 million left that you can invest for the future.
You don’t know exactly when you’ll need the money, though. You probably
have several more playing years, but you could have a bad injury next game.
And the endorsement market is fickle! If you stop playing, you can sell one of
your houses and get rid of your personal jet timeshares, in which case you
think you’ll be fine with about $1 million in annual income. What if you need
that $1 million next year, though?
In this case, one possible solution is to put away $1 million in cash or equivalent
securities because you may need that money at any time. In order to preserve
capital for future spending, you should put about $10 million into a balanced
mixture of stocks and bonds. You may decide to put the remaining $6 million
into a hedge fund — especially one following an absolute return objective to
increase your portfolio to meet your post-retirement needs, all while preserving
capital (see the section “How hedge funds are assets” earlier in this chapter).
And if you don’t get injured? Next year, you can allocate your money in a simi-
lar fashion.
Taking different funds 
to the dressing room
After you calculate the maximum amount of money you can responsibly lock
up in a hedge fund (see the previous section), your next step is to figure out
what type of fund is the best fit for you. Hedge funds fall into two broad cate-
gories: absolute-return and directional; within those categories are many dif-
ferent strategies and asset concentrations (see Part III). (See the chapters of
Part III for more on researching the types of funds and Chapter 18 for info on
doing your due diligence with funds.)
162
Part II: Determining Whether Hedge Funds Are Right for You 

Absolute-return funds or directional funds?
An absolute-return fund is designed to produce a steady but relatively low rate
of return with relatively little risk. In most cases, the expected return is higher
than that of a bond but with less risk. A directional fund swings for the fences,
aiming for the highest possible return, although with a high level of risk. A
directional fund may still have great diversification benefits for its investment
portfolio, especially if it invests in assets that are different from the others in
the non-hedge-fund portion. (See the earlier section “How hedge funds are
assets” for more on the types of funds.)
What type of investment strategy?
Directional and absolute-return fund managers use strategies such as short
selling and leverage, look for arbitrage opportunities, and pay attention to
both corporate and government life cycles. They just trade their assets differ-
ently. (In Part III of this book, you can read about several of the strategies
that hedge funds follow.)
Different asset classes interact with your other investments differently, too.
For example, if you mostly invest in domestic stocks and bonds, you may
want to put your hedge fund allocation into macro funds because those will
have more international exposure. This strategy will reduce the risk of your
overall portfolio better than a U.S. long-short equity fund. 
After they decide between absolute-return and directional strategies, some
hedge fund investors research the track record and reputation of their hedge
fund managers, not the strategies that the managers follow (see Chapter 18).
That tactic may work in some situations, especially if the rest of the invest-
ment portfolio is so well diversified that the incremental effects of the hedge
fund would be small.
Working without transparency
Here’s the problem that many investors have when trying to do allocations
with hedge funds: Hedge fund managers often don’t want to tell investors
what strategies they’re following or where they invest their money. This
secrecy can make it difficult to determine how well a fund is diversifying your
other assets. 
A manager has some good reasons not to give investors too much informa-
tion. The biggest is that the fund’s investment strategy may be highly propri-
etary. If other people find out about it, everyone will follow the strategy, and
the hedge fund’s advantage will be gone. Likewise, if word gets out that cer-
tain hedge fund managers have certain positions, others in the market will
react to that information, and the value may change.

Chapter 9: Fitting Hedge Funds into a Portfolio

However, you need to face facts: Some hedge fund managers just like the aura
of secrecy, even if they don’t need it. And some managers follow really simple
investment strategies, but they don’t want any investors to know that. 
How much disclosure do you need?
Although investors like you prefer disclosure, you don’t all need the same
amount. Here are three key questions to ask yourself: 
 Do you have a legal obligation to know what’s in the hedge fund?
People in charge of investment portfolios covered by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1972 (also called ERISA — a law that
governs pensions and employee benefits) need more disclosure to meet
their obligations than other types of investors. Some hedge fund man-
agers refuse to accept ERISA money for this reason.
 How big a percentage of your overall portfolio is the hedge fund? The
smaller the percentage, the more likely it is that you can take the risk of
not knowing how the manger invests the hedge fund.
 How well diversified is the rest of your portfolio? The greater the
amount of asset diversification you have, the less of an effect the hedge
fund will have. The fund’s performance becomes less important to meet-
ing your overall investment objectives, so it becomes less necessary to
know what’s in the hedge fund when you adjust your portfolio.
How much disclosure can you demand?
Even if the hedge fund manager has good reasons for secrecy (see the previ-
ous section), and even if you don’t need to know all the whys and wherefores
of the hedge fund’s holdings, you still deserve some information about the
fund. Turn to Chapter 18, which covers due diligence, for some information
on what questions to ask of current and prospective managers.

n investing, return is a function of risk. The greater the
return you seek, the greater the amount of risk you’ll
need to take, and the greater the likelihood of getting a
return other than the return you want. The name of the
hedge fund game is hedging: reducing risk relative to the
amount of return expected. Other than following this
mantra, different hedge funds aim for different levels of
expected return, leading to wildly different levels of risk.
They pursue a wide range of strategies to meet their risk
and return objectives, and I look at these strategies in 
Part III.
I also give you some tips for evaluating the performance
of a hedge fund so you can make better decisions before
you pick a fund and while you’re in a fund.

Chapter 10
Buying Low, Selling High: Using
Arbitrage in Hedge Funds
In This Chapter
 Knowing how hedge funds use arbitrage to invest
 Becoming familiar with the tools of arbitrage
 Exploring the many types of arbitrage strategies
A
n economist and a hedge fund manager are walking down the street.
The hedge fund manager looks down and says, “Hey, look, it’s a $20 bill!”
The economist says, “Don’t bother. If it were real, someone would’ve picked it
up already.” The hedge fund manager looks at the bill, sees that it’s real, and
picks it up. He turns to his economist friend and says, “How about if I take
this $20 and buy you a free lunch?”
Did you know that financial types were so funny? Really, they aren’t. That’s the
only joke they know. (I’m kidding, I’m kidding.) This joke describes arbitrage —
the process of buying an asset cheap in one market and selling it for a higher
price in another. In the joke, the economist assumes that there’s no riskless
profit — no $20 bill just lying on the street — or it would’ve already been
taken. The hedge fund manager, on the other hand, sees that the bill is real so
he takes it, with no risk. Economists often say that there’s no such thing as a
free lunch, and they point out that life is full of tradeoffs. To get one thing,
you must give up another. But because the hedge fund manager picked up
the $20 bill on the sidewalk, he can buy lunch without another tradeoff,
except, of course, for giving up the use of the money.
The word arbitrage is from derived from the French word for judgment; a
person who does arbitrage is an arbitrageur, or arb for short.

Many hedge funds use arbitrage as their primary investment strategy. It may
be combined with strategies that increase risk and return, such as high levels
of leverage (or borrowing; see Chapter 11) to increase returns. In this chapter,
I cover the terms and strategies you should know when dealing with hedge
funds that engage in arbitrage. I cover the basics of arbitrage and how funds
put it to good use. I outline the tools that funds use to employ this tactic.
Finally, I list the many types of arbitrage you’re likely to see among the hedge
funds that you investigate for possible future investment. With this info, you’ll
have a better understanding of what a hedge fund manager talks about when
he or she talks about arbitrage.
Putting Arbitrage to Good Use
In theory, arbitrage opportunities don’t exist, because markets are perfectly
efficient, right? (I get to the theory on this later.) In reality, arbitrage takes
place every single day, which forces markets into efficiency. However, the
price differences needed for arbitrage are often small and don’t last long. After
all, the increased demand in the cheap market forces the price up, while the
increased supply in the expensive market forces the price down. In seemingly
no time at all, the arbitrage opportunity disappears. For this reason, success-
ful arbitrageurs have to be paying constant attention to the market, and they
have to be willing to act very quickly. They have no room for indecision.
168
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 
Applying the arbitrage formula
Benjamin Graham was an economist at
Columbia University who wrote extensively
about stocks. He developed a formula to deter-
mine whether an arbitrage transaction will be
profitable. The formula looks like this:
Annual Return = [CG – L (100% – C)] ÷ YP
where
C is the expected chance of success in per-
centage terms.
G is the expected gain in the event of suc-
cess.
L is the expected loss in the event of failure.
Y is the expected holding time in years.
P is the current price of the security.
So, according to Graham’s formula, if you
expect a 50-percent chance (C) of making
$100,000 (G) on an investment that currently
costs $50,000 (P) — and you’ll lose $40,000 (L) if
you’re wrong — and if you think it will take six
months, or 1⁄2, of a year (Y) to find out if you’re
right, your annual return is as follows:
[0.50($100,000) – $40,000(0.5)] ÷ 0.5($50,000)
= 120 percent
This particular transaction would be a go.

People often misuse the word “arbitrage” to describe any kind of aggressive
trading. If you hear a hedge fund manager say that his fund uses arbitrage,
ask what kind of arbitrage is involved.
Here’s a classic arbitrage example: A hedge fund trader notices that a stock is
trading at $11.98 in New York and $11.99 in London. He buys as many shares
as possible in New York, borrowing money if necessary, and immediately sells
those shares in London, making a penny on each one. This type of arbitrage
transaction has no risk, so people often describe it as “finding money on the
sidewalk.”
The following sections dive deeper into the topics of market efficiency and
arbitrage.
Understanding arbitrage 
and market efficiency
Market efficiency, which I cover in Chapter 6, says that market prices reflect
all known information about a stock. Therefore, as I state in the previous sec-
tion, arbitrage simply isn’t possible in theory. But keep in mind that academic
theory describes some kind of financial utopia. By making one assumption —
market efficiency — researchers can test other assumptions — like how
much inflation, unemployment, or returns on a market index influence market
prices.
In the academic world, market efficiency comes in three flavors, with no form
allowing for arbitrage:
 Strong form: Even inside information, known only to company execu-
tives, is reflected in the security’s price.
 Semi-strong form: Price includes all public information, so it may be
possible to profit from insider trading.
 Weak form: Price reflects all historical information, so research that
uncovers new trends may be beneficial.
Someone who believes in market efficiency would say that arbitrage is imagi-
nary because someone would’ve noticed a price difference between markets
already and immediately acted to close it off. That’s why, in the joke at the
beginning of the chapter, the economist says that the $20 on the street can’t
be real, or “someone” would’ve taken it already.
169
Chapter 10: Buying Low, Selling High: Using Arbitrage in Hedge Funds

People with a less-rigid view of the world would say that arbitrage exists, but
the opportunities for taking advantage of it are very few and far between. An
investor who wants to find opportunities and exploit them better pay close
attention to the markets to act quickly when a moment happens.
Finally, people who don’t believe in market efficiency would say that not only
do arbitrage opportunities happen all the time, but also they’re not just weird,
one-off price discrepancies. These people believe that someone in one of the
markets knows something, and if you can figure out what that person knows,
you may have a solid advantage in the marketplace.
Factoring transaction costs into arbitrage
What goes into the cost of trading? First, the fund manager must deal with all
the overhead of having traders on staff, including salaries, bonuses, and ben-
efits. The fund also has the cost of having the information systems in place to
monitor several markets in real time. The free quotes that investors can find
online through such sources as Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com) are
delayed for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on where the security trades. Real-
time quotes are expensive. Not to mention the connection between the hedge
fund and a broker has to be fast enough to execute an arbitrage trade almost
instantaneously.
On most exchanges, the fund manager has to execute the trade through a
broker authorized to handle the transaction, and these brokers charge com-
missions for their services. Commissions are negotiable; managers rarely pay
higher than $0.03 per share, but the cost is never $0.
In addition to commissions, brokers quote most securities on a bid-ask basis.
The bid is price that the broker will pay a seller for a security, and the ask is
the price that the broker charges an investor who wants to buy it. The differ-
ence is the broker’s profit. For example, if the bid is $12.98, and the ask is
$13.01, the broker buys stock from the seller at $12.98 and sells it to an
investor for $13.01, making a profit of $0.03 per share. In the United States,
the minimum spread is $0.01, but it can be quite a bit higher. It isn’t as big a
trading cost as it once was, but you still have to take it into consideration.
In the United States, stocks now trade in decimal amounts (dollars and
cents). They used to trade in 1⁄8 of a dollar, and many bonds still do trade that
way. The use of the 1⁄8 method dates back before the American Revolution,
when the dominant currency in financial markets was the Spanish doubloon.
To simplify trading in those days, people often cut large coins into halves,
quarters, or eighths. In later years, the government minted coins in smaller
170
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

denominations, but the money was based on the idea of eight bits to a whole.
In Robert Louis Stevenson’s book Treasure Island, the parrot keeps cawing,
“Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!” Now you know where that comes from!
What these trading costs mean is that arbitrage may exist, but it only takes
place if the arbitrageur — the person who does the arbitrage transaction —
can make enough of a profit to cover the costs involved. In the example that
kicks off the chapter, the difference in share price between the two markets is
only $0.01. The cost of trading has to be below a penny a share if you have
any hope of making a profit.
Because of transaction costs, hedge funds tend to either commit heavily to
arbitrage or avoid it entirely. A successful arbitrage strategy requires the fol-
lowing with respect to cost:
 Dedication to cover the high fixed costs of real-time quotes in several
markets
 Bandwidth to handle large trades
 Purchasing power to bring down commissions
 Compensation for traders who know what they’re doing
If you plan on investing in a hedge fund that expects to generate most of its
profits from arbitrage, be sure to ask about these factors during due dili-
gence. See Chapter 18 for more information on that.
Pitting true arbitrage versus risk arbitrage
True arbitrage is riskless trading. The purchase of an asset in one market and
the sale of the asset in another happen simultaneously. The fund manager
can count on profit as long as the trades go through immediately. True, risk-
less arbitrage is possible, but rare. No hedge fund that pursues only riskless
arbitrage will stay in business for long.
Most arbitrageurs practice risk arbitrage, which is similar to true arbitrage in
that it seeks to generate profits from price discrepancies; however, risk arbi-
trage involves taking some risk (go figure!). Risk arbitrage still involves
buying one security and selling another, but an investor doesn’t always buy
the same security, and he doesn’t necessarily buy and sell at the same time.
For example, a fund manager may buy the stock of an acquisition target and
sell the stock of an acquirer, waiting until the acquisition finalizes before clos-
ing the transaction, making (he hopes) a tidy profit in the process.
171
Chapter 10: Buying Low, Selling High: Using Arbitrage in Hedge Funds

In many cases, the risk taken is that of time. The trade may work out but not
as soon as the hedge fund manager hopes. In the meantime, his portfolio’s
performance may suffer or loans taken to acquire the position may be called
in. It’s one thing to be right; however, it’s another thing entirely to be right in
time for the decision to matter.
Cracking Open the Arbitrageur’s Toolbox
Riskless opportunities where a fund manager buys a security at one price in one
market and sells the exact same security at a slightly higher price in another
market — at the exact same time — are very few and far between. Therefore, 
to find risky arbitrage opportunities, hedge funds look at similar securities, and
they look for ways to profit from price discrepancies while offsetting much of
the risk. I cover a few of the arbitrageur’s favorite tools for offsetting risk in this
section before I describe different arbitrage strategies in the next.
Drawing upon derivatives
A derivative is a financial instrument (like an option, a future, or a swap; 
see Chapter 5 for more information) that derives its value from the value of
another security. For example, a stock option is a type of derivative that gives
you the right, but not the obligation, to buy shares of the stock at a predeter-
mined price. Whether or not you can get a good deal depends on where the
stock is trading.
Because derivatives are related to securities, they can be useful in risk arbi-
trage. A fund manager may see a price discrepancy between a derivative and
an underlying asset, creating a profitable trading opportunity.
With their value so closely liked to the value of other securities, derivatives
offer many opportunities for constructing risk arbitrage trades. And with a
wider range of low-risk arbitrage opportunities, a fund stands a better chance
of making money. For example, a fund manager could trade options on a
stock rather than the stock itself when setting up arbitrage on a merger. And
if arbitrage trade takes time to play itself out, using interest-rate or currency
futures can offset some of the risk that goes along with waiting. The more
ways a hedge fund can structure a trade, the more arbitrage opportunities it
can grab.
172
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Using leverage
Leverage, which I discuss in detail in Chapter 11, is the process of borrowing
money to trade. Because a hedge fund puts only a little of its own capital to
work and borrows the rest, the return on its capital is much greater than it
would be if it didn’t borrow any money.
Because leverage allows a hedge fund to magnify its returns, it’s a popular tool
for arbitrage. After all, many price discrepancies between securities are small.
If a hedge fund borrows money for a trade, the profit it sees as a percentage of
its assets is much larger than it would be if the fund didn’t use any borrowing.
However, leverage has a downside: Along with magnifying returns, it magni-
fies risk. The fund has to repay the borrowed money, no matter how the trade
works out.
Short-selling
Short-selling, a topic I cover in Chapter 11, gives fund managers a way to
profit from a decline in a security’s price. The short-seller borrows the declin-
ing security (usually from a broker), sells it, and then repurchases the secu-
rity in the market later in order to repay the loan. If the price falls, the profit
is the difference between the price where the fund manager sold the security
and the price where she repurchased it. If the price goes up, though, that dif-
ference is the amount of the loss.
Short-selling allows an arbitrageur more freedom in choosing how to buy
securities low and sell high. By shorting an asset, the seller gives up the risk
of the price going down, which can offer both a way to exploit a price dis-
crepancy and a way to manage the risk of the transaction.
The opposite of short is long. When an investor owns a security, she’s said to
be long.
Synthetic securities
A synthetic security is one created by matching one asset with a combination
of a few others that have the same profit- and loss-profile. For example, you
can think of a stock as a combination of a put option, which has value if the
stock goes down in price, and a call option, which has value if the stock goes
up in price. By designing transactions that create synthetic securities, a
hedge fund manager can create more ways for an asset to be cheaper in one
173
Chapter 10: Buying Low, Selling High: Using Arbitrage in Hedge Funds

market than in another, thus increasing the number of potential arbitrage
opportunities. Many of the arbitrage styles that you can read about later in
this chapter involve the creation of synthetic securities.
A typical arbitrage transaction involving a synthetic security involves short-
ing the security itself and then buying a package of securities that mimic its
payoff.
Flipping through the Rolodex 
of Arbitrage Types
Arbitrageurs use the tools of arbitrage (see the previous section) in many dif-
ferent ways. Most arbitrage funds pick a few strategies to follow, although
some may stick to only one and others may skip from strategy to strategy as
market conditions warrant. Most hedge funds use some forms of arbitrage,
and some may use arbitrage as their primary source of investment returns.
The following sections outline all the varieties of arbitrage transactions that a
hedge fund may use as part of its investment strategy, arranged in alphabetical
order for your reading pleasure. The strategies vary in complexity and in how
often a fund can use them, but all are designed to take advantage of profits from
security price discrepancies. Armed with the information here, you’ll have a
better understanding of how hedge funds try to make money, and you’ll be in 
a better position to evaluate any funds that you consider investing in.
You may come across other types of arbitrage out there, but that doesn’t
mean that people who have found profitable strategies will talk about what
they’re doing. Wherever people still watch markets intently and collect data
on price behavior, the search for small price differences that investors can
turn into large, low-risk profits will continue.
Capital-structure arbitrage
The capital structure of a firm represents how the company is financed. Does
it have debt? How much? Does it have stock? How many classes? Many com-
panies have only one type of stock that trades, but other company portfolios
can be quite complicated. General Motors, for example, has one class of
common stock and 13 different debt securities for its parent company and 
its finance subsidiary. (This situation is actually simpler than in years past,
when the company also had different classes of common stock for its differ-
ent business units.)
174
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

When a company has many different securities trading, arbitrageurs look for
price differences among them. After all, if all the securities are tied to the
same asset — the company’s business — they should trade in a similar fash-
ion. You can’t count on it, though.
Say, for example, that the MightyMug Company has common stock outstand-
ing, as well as 20-year corporate bonds at 7.5 percent interest. The stock
price stays in line with market expectations, but the company bonds fall in
value more than expected given changes in interest rates. An arbitrageur may
buy the bonds and short the stock (see Chapter 11 for more on short-selling),
waiting for the price discrepancy between the two securities to return to its
normal level. That means that the bonds will have increased in price, so he
can sell them at a profit, and the stock will have fallen in price, so he buys it
back to cover the short and locks in a profit.
Convertible arbitrage
Some companies issue convertible bonds (sometimes called a convertible
debenture) or convertible preferred stock. The two types of securities are very
similar: They pay income to the shareholders (interest for convertible bonds
and dividends for convertible preferred stock), and they can be converted
into shares of common stock in the future.
For example, say a $1,000 convertible bond pays 5.5 percent interest and is
convertible into 50 shares of stock. If the stock is less than $20 per share, a
holder can collect the interest income. If the stock appreciates above $20, the
holder can convert, giving up the interest but getting stock cheap. The inter-
est rate is usually below the rate on a corporate bond or the yield on a simi-
lar preferred stock offering. The convertible buyer is okay with that because
she has the right to convert.
Convertible securities generally trade in line with the underlying stock. After
all, the securities represent options to purchase the stock. If the convertible
gets out of line, an arbitrage opportunity presents itself.
Here’s an arbitrage example: An arbitrageur notices that a convertible bond
is selling at a lower price than it should be, given the interest rates and the
price of the company’s common stock. So, she buys the bonds and sells the
stock short (see Chapter 11 for more information on short-selling). The trade
cancels out the stock exposure, reducing the transaction risk and leaving
only the potential for profit as the bond’s price moves back into line.
175
Chapter 10: Buying Low, Selling High: Using Arbitrage in Hedge Funds

Fixed-income arbitrage
Fixed-income securities give holders a regular interest payment. Some people
like to buy them just to get a check deposited every quarter. These securities
may seem safe because the money just keeps rolling in, but they have enor-
mous exposure to fluctuating interest rates.
In fact, if you’ve read through Chapter 6, you’ve heard me say (or read me
saying, I suppose) that interest rates — the price of money — affect the value of
many kinds of securities. Bonds have a great deal of interest-rate exposure, and
so do some stocks. Currencies are highly exposed to changes in rates between
different companies. Derivatives are valued in part with interest rates.
Because interest rates affect so many different securities, they’re a common
focus for arbitrageurs. With fixed-income arbitrage, the trader breaks out the
following:
 The time value of money
 The level of risk in the economy
 The likelihood of repayment
 The inflation-rate effects on different securities
If one of the numbers is out of whack, the trader constructs and executes
trades to profit from it.
Imagine that a hedge-fund trader tracks interest rates on U.S. government
securities. He notices that one-year treasury bills are trading at a higher yield
than expected — especially relative to two-year treasury notes. He shorts the
two-year treasury notes (see Chapter 11) and buys the one-year treasury bills
until the price difference falls back where it should be, given the expectations
for interest rates in the economy.
Index arbitrage
A market index is designed to represent the activity of the market. It can be
designed a few different ways, which I cover in Chapter 14, but an index is
always based on the performance of a group of securities that trade in the
market.
Futures contracts are available on most indexes, for example. These are
derivatives based on the expected future value of the index. Sometimes, the
176
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

value of the futures contract deviates from the value of the index itself. When
that happens, the arbitrageur steps in to make a profit.
Here’s an example: An arbitrageur notices that the S&P 500 futures contract
is looking mighty cheap relative to the S&P 500 index. He shorts all 500
stocks in the index and buys the contracts to profit from the difference.
Most indexes have many securities, so buying a load of them can be expen-
sive. The S&P 500 index has 500 stocks in it! That’s why only the largest
hedge funds are active in index arbitrage, and they use plenty of leverage out
of necessity (as well as the profit motive). Only a few funds are able to buy
enough stocks in the index to make the investment matter, and even fewer
can do it with cash on hand!
Liquidation arbitrage
Liquidation arbitrage is a bet against the breakup value of a business. An arbi-
trageur researches a company to see what it would be worth if it was sold.
Many businesses own real estate, patents, mineral rights, or other resources
that their market values don’t reflect, so selling a company piece by piece
can be profitable. (This strategy is very similar to the bottom-up fundamental
research I describe in Chapter 5.)
Here’s one way to look at liquidation arbitrage: A hedge fund manager looks at
the business of Giant Sloth Industries. The company’s stock has been beaten
up badly because its core chemical business has large environmental liabili-
ties. The company has a subsidiary that owns a patent for a weight-loss drug,
but everyone has overlooked its value. It also owns prime real estate in Silicon
Valley that could be developed for housing, as well as an incredible corporate
art collection. A fund manager realizes that the value of all these parts, net of
the liabilities, is greater than the current market value of the company’s stock.
She buys shares of the company in anticipation that someone will come along
and take over the company at a price that reflects its value.
Back in the 1980s, some huge insider-trading scandals that involved arbi-
trageurs took place. A handful of people (Ivan Boesky? Dennis Levine? Do
those names ring a bell?) found that they could make even bigger profits from
liquidation arbitrage if they knew before everyone else which companies
were being acquired for breakup purposes. Needless to say, this strategy is
illegal. Liquidation arbitrage itself is a fine and legal practice, as long as it’s
based on publicly available information.
Sometimes, liquidation arbitrageurs acquire so many shares in a company that
they can influence whether or not a merger takes place. When this happens,
177
Chapter 10: Buying Low, Selling High: Using Arbitrage in Hedge Funds

the arbitrageurs become known as corporate raiders. You can find out more
about the role of hedge funds in corporate finance decisions in Chapter 12.
Merger arbitrage
Liquidation arbitrage is about doing research in order to be ahead of an
acquisition (see the previous section); merger arbitrage is about profiting
from a company’s acquisition after the merger has been announced. A merger
announcement includes the following:
 The name of the acquiring company
 The name of the company being taken over (and no matter what PR
people say, there are no mergers of equals)
 The price of the transaction
 The currency (cash, stock, debt)
 The date the merger is expected to close
Any of these variables can change: The acquiring company may decide that
the deal is a bad one and walk away, for example; maybe the target company
finds a buyer offering more money. The list goes on. All those variables create
trading opportunities, although not all are riskless.
Consider this example: The management of Instruments R Us announces that
it plans to acquire Violet Violins for a total price of $150 million in Instruments
R Us stock, which works out to $25 per share. The deal is expected to close in
three months. The Instruments R Us stock trades at $40 per share. Violet
Violins was trading at $20 per share when the merger was announced. After
the news hits the tape, Violet Violins shares jump to $24.75. An arbitrageur
swoops in and sells shares of Instruments R Us and buys shares (goes long, in
trader-speak) of Violet Violins. If the merger holds up, the arbitrageur locks in
the $0.25 per share difference between the current $24.75 price of Violet Violins
and the $25.00 merger price. If the deal doesn’t go through, Violet Violins stock
will fall and Instruments R Us stock will go up.
When companies announce a big merger, traders sometimes get caught up in
the mood of the moment and engage in garbatrage. That is, everyone gets so
excited that even businesses with no real connection to the merger become
part of the speculation. For example, if a drug company buys a shampoo
manufacturer, the shares of any and all beauty-products manufacturers may
go up. This may cause folks to pay too much money because not all the
shares will be worth their newly inflated price.
178
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Option arbitrage
Options come in many varieties, even if they exist on the same underlying
security. They come in different types, puts (bets on the underlying security
price going down), and calls (bets on the underlying security price going up).
They have different prices, where a holder can cash the option in for the
underlying security, and different expiration dates. You can exercise some
options, known as European options, at any time between the date of issue
and the expiration date, and you can exercise others, known as American
options, only at the expiration date. (American and European options can be
issued anywhere; see Chapter 5 for more info on options.)
Needless to say, having so many securities that are almost the same creates
plenty of opportunities for a knowledgeable arbitrageur to find profitable
price discrepancies.
For example, say a hedge fund’s options trader notices that the options
exchanges are assuming a slightly higher price for a security than in the secu-
rity’s own market. She buys the underlying security and then buys a put and
sells a call with the same strike price and expiration date. The put-call transac-
tion has the same payoff as shorting the security, so she has effectively bought
the security cheap in one market and sold it at a higher price in another.
Pairs trading
Pairs trading is a form of long-short hedging (which I describe in Chapter 11)
that looks for discrepancies among securities in a given industry sector. If
one security appears to be overvalued relative to others, a savvy arbitrageur
will short that security; the arbitrageur then buys another security in the
group that seems to be undervalued.
Say, for example, that a hedge fund’s analyst is studying companies in the
grocery business. He notices that the stock of Chubby Cubby markets, which
is taking market share in the industry, is trading at a lower price/earnings
ratio than it usually does. Meanwhile, shares in the Gems Market look rela-
tively expensive. The analyst figures that other investors will come to their
senses soon; when that happens, he hopes to profit by shorting shares in the
Gems and buying shares in Chubby Cubby, betting that Chubby Cubby
increases in value and the Gems decreases.
179
Chapter 10: Buying Low, Selling High: Using Arbitrage in Hedge Funds

Scalping
Scalping is a form of arbitrage that takes advantage of small price movements
throughout the day — an especially common practice in commodities mar-
kets. In most cases, scalpers look to take advantage of changes in a security’s
bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread represents the difference between the
price that a broker will buy a security for from those who want to sell it (the
bid) and the price that the broker will charge those who want to buy it (the
ask — also called the offer in some markets).
For many securities, the bid-ask spread stays fairly constant over time
because the supply and demand should balance out. If everyone has the
same information (the old market-efficiency situation), their trading levels
are in balance and the broker-dealers can maintain a steady profit.
Sometimes, however, the spread will be just a little out of balance compared
to normal levels. A scalper can take advantage of that situation by buying the
security, waiting even a minute or two for the spread to change, and then sell-
ing it at a profit. Or, the scalper can buy the security, wait a few minutes for
the price to go up a small amount, and then sell it.
The scalper has to work quickly to make many small trades. He has to have a
low commission structure in place, or else transactions costs will kill him. He
also has to be careful to get out of the market as soon as a news event comes
along that causes the security’s trading to become more volatile, because
scalping becomes a high-risk proposition when market prices are changing
quickly. This is why some folks describe scalping as “picking up nickels in
front of a steamroller.”
Scalping probably isn’t a primary strategy for any hedge fund, but the strat-
egy may give a trader profit opportunities on a slow day.
Imagine that a security has a bid-ask quote of $15.12–$15.17. The scalper
buys 1,000 shares of the security at the ask, $15.17. He waits a few minutes
until the price changes to $15.18–$15.22. He sells his position at $15.18,
making $10. A few minutes later, the price quote becomes $15.15–$15.22. He
buys another 1,000 at $15.22. A few minutes later, the price quote changes to
$15.18–$15.23, so he sells at $15.23, making another $10.
The scalping I describe in this section is perfectly legal. One of my friends
has a husband who scalps corn at the Chicago Board of Trade, an occupa-
tional description that always cracks me up. But the word “scalping” is also
used to describe the illegal practice of promoting a security in public and
then selling it in private. If a hedge fund manager goes on a cable finance
news show, talks about how great a stock is so that the price goes up, and
180

then sells it during its rise, she commits the crime of scalping. Be careful not
to confuse the two strategies!
Statistical arbitrage
Statistical arbitrage is a popular hedge fund trading strategy that involves the
use of complex mathematical models to determine where a security should
be priced. Have you read the discussion of the random walk in an efficient
market in Chapter 6? That theory says that price changes are random. And
when you talk about the normal distribution of returns, a series of random
events converges on a mean.
For example, a standard die has six sides. If you roll it, any one of those six
results is equally likely. If you roll the die 100 times, the average of the results
should be close to 3.5, which is equal to (1 + 2 + 3+ 4 + 5 + 6) ÷ 6. If the aver-
age deviates from 3.5 a significant amount, rolling the die several more times
should give you results that begin to close in on the mean. If not, you can
conclude that your die is loaded.
In statistical arbitrage, the trader works off of huge databases of securities
prices that indicate where securities should trade, on average. In most cases,
the trader is looking for an average price relative to a trend, like interest rates
or the prices of a peer. When a securities price deviates from the norm, the
trader enters into a position to take advantage.
Here’s an arbitrage example: A hedge fund has data that shows for the past
15 years, electric utility companies have moved in a fixed percentage relative
to interest rates. The fund analyst notices that the relationship has diverged,
with the stocks having increased in value more than expected relative to
rates. The fund sells short a large group (also called a basket) of utility
stocks, expecting that the prices of the utility stocks will fall so that the
normal relationship continues to hold. (See Chapter 11 for more information
on short-selling.)
Warrant arbitrage
A warrant is similar to an option, but a company issues it rather than an
options exchange. A warrant gives the holder the right to exchange it for
shares of the company’s stock at a predetermined price. Not many compa-
nies issue them, but those that do usually issue warrants along with debt as a
way of giving holders the right to convert into stock or to sell that right to
181
Chapter 10: Buying Low, Selling High: Using Arbitrage in Hedge Funds

someone else. As with options and converts, warrant values sometimes differ
from the value of the stock that they can be converted into.
Say, for example, that warrants on CupCakeCo seem to be trading on the
assumption that CupCakeCo’s shares are more valuable than they are right
now. An arbitrageur can short the warrants and buy the underlying shares to
turn a quick profit.

E
quity-based hedge funds, which are hedge funds that invest in equities,
start with the same investment strategies as mutual funds, brokerage
accounts, or other types of investment portfolios that invest in equities.
However, equity hedge funds use two unique strategies — short-selling and
leveraging — to change the risk profiles of their investments in stocks.
Depending on your hedge fund’s strategy and market expectations, it may
have greater or less risk than the market, in part because of the use of these
strategies (see Chapter 6 for more on risk and return). And you can assume
that most hedge funds are using some leverage and some short-selling to
reach their risk and return objectives.
You can find out about the basics of equities and other types of investment
assets in Chapter 5. In this chapter, I show you how hedge funds invest in
equities. They rarely buy and hold stocks in the way that traditional invest-
ments do (although they will if they see the right opportunities). Instead,
hedge funds use techniques like short-selling and leveraging to reduce the
risk of their portfolios while increasing return — or so you hope! In this way,
hedge funds feature a different way of thinking about stock investing. If you’re
investigating hedge funds, you’ll likely come across these types of funds. The
more you know about them, the better equipped you’ll be to make good deci-
sions with your money.

Here’s one other thing to note about hedge funds: Fund managers can mess
around with the risk-and-return profiles of their portfolios by using a wide
range of strategies. Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds have no hard and fast
rules about what type of investment strategy is best for any given type of
investor. When researching hedge funds, you need to know more than just
whether the fund manager prefers big-cap stocks or small-cap stocks and
whether she prefers to manage risk through short-selling or through deriva-
tives. You also need to know what her risk and return targets are and whether
they make sense for your investment objectives. (You can discover more
about setting investment objectives in Chapters 7, 8, and 9.)
Short-Selling versus Leveraging: 
A Brief Overview
Short-selling and leveraging, two investing strategies, are fundamental to the
operations of a hedge fund. They’re widely associated with equity trading,
although they can be used with other types of securities and derivatives. In
fact, almost all hedge funds use some short-selling and leverage in order to
increase return for a given level of risk. Therefore, if you’re interested in
hedge funds, you should find out as much as you can about short-selling and
leverage so that you have a better understanding of what hedge funds do.
The following list introduces these topics to begin your learning process:
 Short-selling: Borrowing an asset (like a stock or bond), selling it, and then
buying it back to repay the loaned asset. If the asset goes down in price,
the hedge fund makes the difference between the price where it sold the
asset and the price where it repurchased the asset. Of course, if the asset
appreciates in price, the hedge fund loses money. The opposite of short is
long, so an investor who is long is an investor who owns the asset.
If much of your portfolio sits in an S&P 500 index fund — a fund that
invests in all the securities in the S&P 500 in the same proportion as the
index in order to generate the same return — you have significant expo-
sure to the stock market, which means you have market risk. One way to
reduce that risk without giving up your expected return is to seek out equi-
ties with a different risk profile. Short-selling gives you more places to look.
 Leverage: Borrowing money to invest, often from brokerage firms.
Leverage increases your potential return, but also increases your risk.
Hedge funds use leverage, but so do other types of accounts, and many
individual investors use it, too.
You can find more coverage on leverage and short-selling in Chapter 6.

Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Strutting in the Equity Style Show
In this section, I talk about some different investment styles used by long
equity managers, or those equity investors who don’t short stocks (and 
thus are rarely hedge fund managers, although a small number of hedge fund
managers are long-only). With this information, you’ll have a sense of how a
hedge fund manager may start the hedging process; at the least, you’ll under-
stand how some hedge fund strategies are different from the strategies used
by other types of investment accounts.
Long equity managers fall into several broad categories and employ several
styles, often called style boxes. Fund managers use these categories to guide
their choices for the long portions of their portfolios (the securities that they
own, not those that they short) or to determine the risk that they can reduce
with hedging strategies. At a minimum, you want to recognize the terms I
cover in this section when they come up in conversation.
Few hedge funds use the strategies in this section exclusively. Hedge fund
managers are in the business of using exotic investment techniques in order
to beat the market — and to justify their high fees.
Trying on a large cap
A large cap fund, which may be a hedge fund, a mutual fund, or another type
of investment portfolio, invests in companies with a market capitalization
(shares outstanding multiplied by current price) of $5 billion or more. These
companies tend to be multinational behemoths with steady performance and
fortunes tied to the global economy. You can find these companies in the S&P
500, the Fortune 500, and on every other 500 list, save the Indy 500.
Many large cap managers engage in a strategy called closet indexing: They buy
shares in the largest companies in the S&P 500 in more or less the same pro-
portion as the S&P index. The result is that the portion of the portfolio con-
taining the large cap shares has almost identical risk and return as the index
but for the higher fee that an active manager receives. A hedge fund manager
who does closet indexing isn’t hedging, so she isn’t doing what you pay her to.
Fitting for a small cap
A small cap stock is a share of a company with a market capitalization of
under $1 billion. These companies tend to be growing faster than the market
185
Chapter 11: Short-Selling, Leveraging, and Other Equity Strategies

as a whole, and they aren’t as closely covered by investment analysts as
larger companies, so their shares may not be as expensive as those in similar
but better-known companies.
Some fund managers concentrate on investing in company stocks with a
market cap of under $100 million, believing that’s where the real money-
making opportunities lie because these stocks are even less covered than
small cap stocks, so the managers may be getting in on the ground floor. 
This style of investing, known as micro cap, is similar to venture capital and
requires that the fund manager do careful research, because other investors
may be showing little interest in the company.
What’s in between $5 billion and $1 billion? Mid cap investments, which have
characteristics of both large cap and small cap stocks. Easy, huh? Some small
and mid cap companies will grow and graduate to the next level. However,
some mid cap companies used to be large cap companies before they ran
into trouble, and some small caps are former mid caps whose growing days
are over.
Note that the industry has no standard cutoff for small, mid, and large cap
stocks. Different analysts and money-management firms set their own para-
meters, and the parameters tend to go up when the market goes up and come
down a little bit when the market comes down. So, if you come across a hedge
fund manager who defines companies with a capitalization of $2 billion as
small cap stocks, she isn’t doing anything wrong; she’s just using a cutoff that
works with what she sees in the market at that point.
If a hedge fund manager mentions capitalization as a style, you should cer-
tainly ask about how the fund defines the cutoffs.
Investing according to growth and GARP
A growth fund looks to buy stock in companies that are growing their revenue
and earnings faster than the market as a whole. Hedge funds expect these
equities to appreciate more than the market and to have some life to them,
making them longer-term holdings.
Because markets are structured to be reasonably efficient, growth stocks
tend to be more expensive than stocks in companies that are growing at a
normal rate. For this reason, many fund managers try to find cheap growth
stocks, following a strategy called Growth At the Right Price (or Growth At a
Reasonable Price [GARP]). The fund manager attempts to combine growth
with low price-to-earnings ratios in order to earn a greater-than-market return
for a market rate of risk.
186
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

So, what’s cheap and what’s expensive? Professional investors look at the stock
price relative to a company’s earnings and assets, not the absolute stock price,
to determine the value of a stock. A stock priced at $5.00 per share may be
expensive if the company is losing money, and a stock priced at $350.00 per
share may be a bargain if the company has $400.00 per share in real estate that
other investors are overlooking. You can certainly ask a hedge fund manager
about the fund’s valuation methods used to determine whether a stock is cheap.
Swooping in on lowly equities 
with value investing
Value investors are the most traditional of equity investors. Guided by the
classic text Security Analysis (McGraw-Hill), written by Benjamin Graham and
David Dodd in 1934 and updated frequently since then, hedge fund managers
who consider themselves value investors look for stocks that are cheap based
on accounting earnings or asset values. They shoot for companies that have
solid assets, plenty of cash, and inferiority complexes because the market
doesn’t recognized them. Value investors care more about what a business
would look like dead, with the assets sold and the proceeds distributed to
shareholders, than what it would look like if it grew in the future.
Sometimes, when a stock takes a hit on a bit of bad news, a hedge fund man-
ager will swoop in and buy shares from panicking sellers. Even if the stock
never recovers its old high-flying price, it may recover slightly after investors
digest the news, allowing the value manager to make a quick profit. On the
other hand, value investors sometimes fall into value traps when stocks keep
getting cheaper and cheaper. They buy all the way down until the companies
end up in bankruptcy and the investments are worthless.
Alpha is a rate of return over and above the market rate of return, but for the
same amount of risk. Hedge fund managers are on an endless search for
alpha, and many think that buying into unappreciated or unrecognized com-
panies may be one way to capture their elusive quarry (see Chapter 6 for
more on the topic).
Keeping options open for 
special style situations
Many hedge fund managers avoid certain style boxes for their portfolios.
They may label themselves special-situations investors or say that they like to
take an opportunistic approach. A sharp manager may want to keep his
187
Chapter 11: Short-Selling, Leveraging, and Other Equity Strategies

options open, especially at a larger firm that can afford investment analysts
and traders who have their own investment niches. Other managers may
want flexibility to move between styles whenever the current en vogue style
isn’t working out. A cynic may say that this is why fund managers are often
so secretive about their strategies (see Chapter 8 for more on transparency).
A special-situations investor doesn’t like to declare allegiance to any one
style of equity investing; he prefers to look at stocks that seem likely to
appreciate, for a variety of reasons:
 Because they’re cheap
 Because they’re going to grow
 Because of a takeover battle (see Chapter 12)
Although it seems like a novel idea to keep all investment options open, 
special-situations investors can end up chasing ideas all over the place. With
no discipline to help them determine valuation, these investors may end up
buying high and selling low, which is a sure path to ruin. If you interview a
special-situations fund manager because you’re interested in his fund’s ability
to handle your money, ask how he makes his investing decisions (see
Chapter 18 for more on doing your due diligence).
Market Neutrality: Taking the Market
out of Hedge-Fund Performance
Wouldn’t it be great to receive a market return on an equity investment with-
out exposing yourself to market risk? When you or your hedge fund buys a
stock, you buy some exposure to the risk-and-return performance of the
market as a whole, which may not be your intention. A typical, fully diversi-
fied equity portfolio looks a lot like an index fund (an investment fund that
seeks to duplicate the performance of a market index). The more securities
you hold, and the more diversified your portfolio, the more your portfolio’s
performance will mirror that of the market, and you’ll be compensated for
market risk that you take.
But here’s the thing about equity investing: With a typical, diversified equity
portfolio, you can earn only the market rate of return. Although you take on
the same amount of risk as the market, that may be more risk than you want.
For these reasons, many hedge funds have a market-neutral strategy. You
expect a market-neutral portfolio to generate a positive return, regardless of
what the market does. This doesn’t mean that a market-neutral portfolio will
generate a higher return than the market, although it should when the market
loses money.
188
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Whatever you do, you don’t want to give up all risk on your investments.
Without risk, your investments have no potential for return (see Chapter 6
for more on risk and return).
Of course, even Switzerland has its biases. A fund manager has to tweak a
market-neutral portfolio to maintain its neutrality, so the manager needs a
system for the tweaking process. The three common styles of market-neutral
investing are creating beta-neutral, dollar-neutral, and sector-neutral portfolios.
Being beta neutral
Many hedge fund managers go back to academic theory and use beta as the
neutral point when figuring out ways to make their portfolios market neutral.
A beta-neutral portfolio is made up of securities that have a weighted average
beta of 0 — in other words, the portfolio has no market exposure (see
Chapter 6 for more on beta). This strategy encompasses what a traditional
hedge fund is all about: generating an investment return that isn’t exposed to
market risk.
Under the Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory (MPT), which I discuss in
detail in Chapter 6, the market has a beta of 1, and a stock that’s correlated with
the market also has a beta of 1. A security that’s negatively correlated with the
market has a beta of –1, and a security that features no correlation with the
market has a beta of 0.
189
Chapter 11: Short-Selling, Leveraging, and Other Equity Strategies
A beta-neutral sample trade
A portfolio manager is considering three stocks
for her portfolio: one with a beta of 1.50, one
with a beta of 0.40, and one with a beta of –0.75.
She wants to figure out what percentage of her
fund she should put in each security in order to
achieve a beta of 0 (for more on balancing a
portfolio, see the section “Rebalancing a
Portfolio” later in the chapter). If she meets her
goal, she can eliminate her fund’s exposure to
the market, which will help her reduce the over-
all risk in her portfolio. She calculates the
weighted average by multiplying the beta of the
stock times its portfolio percentage, as shown
in the following table.
Stock
Beta
Portfolio Percentage
Weighted Beta
A
1.50
20.5%
30.8%
B
0.40
25.1%
10.0%
C
(0.75)
54.4%
–40.8%
100.0%
0.0%

Few 0-beta securities exist in the market, because if a security is part of the
market, it almost definitely has some bit of exposure to it. The closest asset 
to a 0-beta security is a short-term U.S. treasury security, which has a very low
return. A beta-neutral hedge fund has to generate a return greater than treasuries
in order to attract assets! Otherwise, investors will simply buy low-returning, 0-
beta treasuries directly from the U.S. government (www.savingsbonds.gov),
saving all commissions, fees, and performance bonuses.
In order to maintain 0 beta while maximizing return, a fund manager can run
a program that comes up with optimal portfolio weighting (for more on this
topic, see the section “Rebalancing a Portfolio” later in this chapter). In some
ways, a beta-neutral portfolio is as much about programming as it is about
picking stocks, because the weightings are very difficult to calculate by hand.
Finding negative-beta stocks, on the other hand, is easy. Shorting a stock is
the same as reversing its beta, so a fund manager can generate negative-beta
securities by taking short positions in stocks with positive betas (see the sec-
tion “Short-Selling versus Leveraging: A Brief Overview”).
This tactic is a relatively simple weighted-average strategy that a fund can
undertake by using spreadsheet software, especially with the help of the
goal-seek function. A hedge fund that has many positions probably uses opti-
mization software to improve the speed of the calculations.
Beta is the relationship of a security to the market as a whole. Firms that rely
heavily on beta for their investment-management decisions calculate beta in-
house, although they can find research services that publish versions of beta.
Services or brokerage firms often give beta with a detailed stock-price quote —
Yahoo Finance, for example. The beta given by these services may not be accu-
rate or up-to-date, however.
Establishing dollar neutrality
Another basis for market neutrality is the amount of money under manage-
ment. In a dollar-neutral portfolio, the hedge fund manager holds the same
amount of money in short positions — that is, in securities that he borrowed
and then sold in hopes that they would go down in price so that the fund
could repurchase them at a lower price to repay the loan — as in long posi-
tions — securities that the fund owns outright. With this strategy, the portfo-
lio’s expected return isn’t highly exposed to the market, because the portfolio
should benefit no matter what direction the market moves. An investor fol-
lows this strategy to eliminate market risk from a portfolio. Of course, if you
want to have market risk, this feature would be a disadvantage. It all depends
on your point of view.
190
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Staying sector neutral
Aside from beta neutrality and dollar neutrality, a hedge fund manager can
achieve market neutrality through the sectors in market indexes, which
aren’t exactly neutral. Certain industries represented in the investment
indexes perform differently than others, which can make index performance
more volatile than a true market investment should be. (This is a relative
measure and can vary from industry to industry and time to time. For exam-
ple, sometimes technology companies are volatile; at other times, utility com-
panies are volatile.) In fact, the people who select the stocks for the indexes
have been known to make additions and subtractions that make the indexes
perform better, even if the indexes become less representative of the market
and the economy.
A hedge fund manager has a chance to structure his or her portfolio free of
political influences, generating less risk than may be found in an index fund in
the process. The manager can do this by weighting each industry sector
equally so that Internet stocks don’t crowd out automaker stocks, for exam-
ple. This is called sector neutrality. This strategy doesn’t eliminate market
risk, but it does reduce it. Many hedge fund managers combine sector neu-
trality with other portfolio strategies, such as arbitrage or leverage (see
Chapter 10).
191
Chapter 11: Short-Selling, Leveraging, and Other Equity Strategies
A dollar-neutral sample trade
A dollar-neutral fund manager receives $1 mil-
lion from an investor to put to use. The follow-
ing list shows the steps he goes through to
establish a dollar-neutral portfolio:
1. The fund manager goes through the list of
stocks in a market index and identifies
undervalued securities that he expects to
do as well as or better than the market; he
also looks for overvalued securities that he
expects to do worse.
2. He takes the funds received from the
investor and establishes long positions
(buys) in the undervalued basket of stocks.
3. He borrows $1 million worth of the overval-
ued stocks (known as leveraging) and sells
them short (see the section “Short-Selling
versus Leveraging: A Brief Overview”).
On paper, the fund manager has a portfolio
worth nothing because he bought and sold an
equal amount. However, he expects the long
portfolio to generate a market return plus some
additional return from the selection of under-
valued stocks. He expects the short portfolio to
lose the market return but gain some additional
return because the shorted, overvalued stocks
should either go down more than the market or
at least not appreciate as much as the market.
The market returns cancel each other out, leav-
ing the excess return from the identification of
the overvalued and undervalued securities.

When Chrysler merged with Daimler-Benz, the company was removed from
one index, the S&P 500 (www.standardandpoors.com), because it was no
longer a company in the United States. The S&P replaced Chrysler with Yahoo!,
which I’m sure had nothing to do with the fact that the year was 1998, the 
dot-com stocks were booming, and the S&P 500 received a nice performance
increase from the switch. Yes, I’m being sarcastic. Just remember, in the market,
as in life, it’s almost impossible to be completely neutral all the time.
Rebalancing a Portfolio
When structuring a portfolio, a hedge fund manager starts out by calculating
how much money to put into different investments — in other words, how to
weight the portfolio. After the investments hit the books, some of the securi-
ties go up, some go down, and all the manager’s hard work goes right out the
window! For this reason, it’s imperative that the fund manager rebalances to
maintain the fund’s (and its investors’) desired risk-and-return profile. The
hedge fund manager monitors the portfolio, buying and selling securities as
necessary to maintain the fund’s desired characteristics and to get back to
the starting point, wherever it may be.
Any fund manager who wants to maintain a set beta position (see the section
“Being beta neutral”) has to rebalance. For that matter, any investor who
wants to maintain a target risk-and-return profile should rebalance his or her
portfolio periodically.
Naturally, this give and take comes with a catch — buying and selling is
expensive. The person who does the trading will have to pay commissions
and may create tax liabilities (see Chapter 8). Some hedge-fund positions sit
in illiquid securities, so the fund can’t easily add to or reduce the securities
192
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 
A sector-neutral sample trade
A hedge fund manager receives a $1 million
investment for a portfolio that the investor
wants to be sector-neutral relative to the S&P
500 index. The fund manager invests the money
equally in nine S&P 500 industry groups: Basic
Materials, Conglomerates, Consumer Goods,
Financial, Health Care, Industrial Goods, Services,
Technology, and Utilities. In the process, she
buys more securities in the undervalued sec-
tors and less in the overvalued ones, reducing
the risk of the portfolio relative to the market.
The portfolio still has market exposure, but the
exposure is less than it may be with other types
of investments.

held without causing big price changes. Options and futures may help the sit-
uation. For example, to reduce exposure to certain stocks owned outright in
the portfolio, a portfolio manager can write a put, giving the manager the
right but not the obligation to sell the stock at an agreed-upon price. This
tactic reduces the amount of exposure, but the manager doesn’t have to sell
the underlying security.
I cover options and futures in great detail in Chapters 5 and 12, but here’s a
quick reminder of the difference between a put and a call. A call gives you the
right, but not the obligation, to buy a security, so calls make money when the
security goes up in value. A put gives you the right, but not the obligation, to
sell a security, so puts make money when the security goes down. Want an
easy memory trick? “You call up your friend to put down your enemy.”
A savvy hedge fund investor needs to know how the hedge fund rebalances
its portfolio and how often it performs the task. Otherwise, the risk in the
portfolio will be all wrong for the investor. You should ask about this during
due diligence (see Chapter 18).
Rebalancing your portfolio is a good practice to ensure that you continue to
meet the investment objectives that you set out with initially. It’s also a way
of forcing you to buy low and sell high. Here’s what you do:
1. Set your objectives.
Start your portfolio with your investment objectives in place. How much
risk do you want? How much exposure to different asset classes? How much
cash flow do you need to generate, and when do you need it? Part II of this
book has extensive information on how to set investment objectives.
2. Develop a portfolio that meets your objectives.
This process is a little more involved than a line on a checklist. Chapters
7 and 9 can help you out.
3. Run the portfolio for a set time period.
Some people make a practice of rebalancing once per year, some once
per quarter. What’s right for you depends on the portfolio strategy and
the trading costs incurred during the rebalancing.
4. Evaluate the portfolio’s performance.
At the end of the time period, see where your portfolio stands relative to
your objectives. Is your portfolio still in proportion? Probably not.
5. Evaluate your objectives.
Does your portfolio still meet your needs? Maybe. Have your needs
changed? Maybe, maybe not.
193
Chapter 11: Short-Selling, Leveraging, and Other Equity Strategies

6. Update your asset parameters.
The risk-and-return profiles of different assets change over time. Beta is
fickle (see Chapter 6 for more information on beta). Your objectives may
stay the same, but the asset allocation you need to reach them may be
very different after six months or a year (see Chapter 9 for more on
asset allocation).
7. Buy and sell assets to meet the ideal portfolio proportions.
Armed with all this information on your portfolio’s performance, asset
parameters, and your needs, sell off enough of the over-weighted assets
to bring that class back into proportion. Use the proceeds you generate
to buy more of the under-weighted classes.

Putting rebalancing into practice: A sample trade
A beta-neutral portfolio manager (see the sec-
tion “Being beta neutral”) started out with 20.5
percent of his funds in stock A, 25.1 percent in
stock B, and 54.4 percent in stock C. His alloca-
tion created a 0-beta portfolio. Each of the
stocks performed differently, and at the end of

tion. See the following table for an illustration

Long-Short Funds
A long-short fund is actually a traditional hedge fund (see Chapter 1); it buys
and sells stocks according to its risk profile and market conditions. A long-
short manager probably doesn’t worry about market neutrality (see the sec-
tion “Market Neutrality: Taking the Market out of Hedge-Fund Performance”),
assuming that her short positions are enough to offset the general risk of the
market. The fund’s investors probably aren’t looking for market neutrality,
either. They may want market risk, particularly if they have reason to expect
that the market will be going up.
Some long-short managers match stocks in a given industry, like technology
or healthcare. Some look for interesting opportunities to buy and sell, regard-
less of market conditions or industry sectors.
Nowadays, people apply the term “hedge fund” to any unregulated invest-
ment partnership. Although the first hedge funds were long-short funds, not
all hedge funds follow this strategy.
A long-short fund manager looks for overvalued assets to sell and underval-
ued assets to buy. The valuation may be relative to the current assets and
earnings of the securities or relative to the future prospects for the compa-
nies. Matching the two allows for reduced risk and increased returns — the
very stuff of the hedge-fund game.
Some hedge fund managers allocate parts of their portfolios to pure short-
selling. (The other part of the portfolio is long but not matched to the short
assets, so this is a type of long-short fund.) These managers want to increase
their risk (and thus their expected returns) by finding overvalued securities in
the market and then selling them short. This strategy isn’t for the faint of heart,
because the most a stock can go down is 100 percent, to 0, but the most it can
go up is infinity. If the economy grows, the stock market should grow, too, so
short-selling can be a bloody, quixotic quest. That’s why most hedge fund man-
agers view short-selling as part of a hedged portfolio, not the centerpiece of it.

The flip side of this is a long strategy called a short squeeze, in which a hedge
fund or other portfolio manager looks for stocks that have been shorted. At
some point, all the short-sellers have to buy back the stocks to repay the
lenders. This means that someone can buy up enough of the stock to push
the prices higher, causing investors on the short side to start losing money.
As the shorts lose money, the managers can buy shares to cover the loans
and get out of the positions; their buying drives the prices even higher.
Most short-sellers do excellent research. An unscrupulous few have been
known to drive asset prices down by starting ugly rumors and spreading out-
right lies. As a result, short-selling isn’t a game for the faint of heart.

Long-short funds: A sample trade
Your hedge fund manager tells you that he has
reason to believe that WidgeCo will take market
share in the widget industry, which is growing
at a good rate. WidgeCo’s competitor, Acme
Widgets, doesn’t seem to be doing as well and
is losing its share of the market to WidgeCo. So,
your manager buys shares of WidgeCo and
sells shares of Acme Widgets. If WidgeCo
grows faster than the industry by taking shares
from Acme Widgets, you maximize return as
WidgeCo goes up and Acme Widgets goes
down. If both WidgeCo and Acme do well, your
fund won’t make much money, but you won’t
lose much, either — your gain on WidgeCo
helps offset your loss on Acme Widgets. And if
your savvy fund manager is wrong and both
stocks go down, your gain on Acme Widgets
will offset your loss on WidgeCo. The only bad
scenario is if WidgeCo goes down while Acme
Widgets goes up; this puts you in trouble
because you would lose money on both your
long and your short positions, with no offsetting
gains.
The trade described here — buying WidgeCo
and shorting Acme — gives the portfolio expo-
sure to the widget industry. The short position
reduces risk while increasing the potential for
return. What’s not to like about that? The fol-
lowing table illustrates this long-short example.

The Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory (MPT; see Chapter 6) assumes
that investors trade both long and short, using no-cost borrowing and lend-
ing. Most investors can’t do that; in the real world, lenders charge borrowers
interest, which many see as a flaw in the ivory-tower approach. But many
hedge funds can come close.
Making Market Calls
A traditional hedge fund — namely, a long-short hedge fund (see the previous
section) — hedges risk. A modern, lightly regulated partnership may enlist all
sorts of risky strategies to increase return. As long as the fund doesn’t closely
correlate the risk with the other holdings in the portfolio, it can meet its goal
of reducing risk. What’s more, a strategy keyed off of market performance
doesn’t require the portfolio manager to determine how the market is moving.
But some investors want more. They want return tied to the market in one
form only — a return that beats the market handily. But here’s the thing: How
do you call the market? In other words, how do you foresee the future? Anyone
who can call the market consistently is retired to a beachfront estate in Maui,
not running a hedge fund. Some hedge fund managers are close to affording a
beach hideout, but others are still trying to beat the market in order to get
there. But how? How can a fund manager call the market in order to figure out
how to position her portfolio? Magic? Tea leaves? Astrology? Or hardcore
analysis? Maybe a little of each strategy, and it’s a perilous enterprise.
Predicting the market is nearly impossible to do in the long run. Money man-
agers try to predict the future all the time, but almost all fail, whether they’re
running hedge funds or other investment portfolios. Don’t expect a hedge
fund you’re interested in to beat the market, and be leery of a fund manager
who claims to be a seer. Instead, think about how the hedge fund will help
you manage risk.
In this section, I describe some of the things that hedge fund managers look
for when they make decisions about buying and selling securities.
Investing with event-driven calls
An event-driven manager looks at situations he expects to happen in the
market, guesses how the market will react, and invests accordingly. A man-
ager always has two moving pieces when making event driven calls: predict-
ing the event and determining what the market expects the event to be.
For example, say a country has an election coming up, and political pundits
(and your fund manager) expect the socialist candidate to lose. If that happens,
197
Chapter 11: Short-Selling, Leveraging, and Other Equity Strategies

financial experts expect the currency to appreciate and the stock market to
rally. Two predictions are at play: the outcome of the election and the market’s
response to that outcome. Both have some probability of happening, but nei-
ther is 100-percent certain. The fund manager has a few choices. She can ana-
lyze the current situation and make a bet based on her conclusions. For
example, if she thinks that the socialist candidate will lose, she can buy stock
traded in that country in advance of the election. Or she can design trades
based on either election outcome — one long, based on the socialist candidate
losing, and one short, based on the socialist candidate winning — and then
hold them until the news is announced, acting on them only at that point.
Taking advantage of market timing
A hedge fund manager who times the market allocates different portions 
of his portfolio to different asset classes (see Chapter 9 for more on asset
classes). The exact proportion for each class varies with different market
indicators. The idea is to have plenty of money in assets that the fund man-
ager expects to do well and to put less money in assets that aren’t supposed
to do as well. The difference between a market-timing strategy and an event-
driven strategy (see the previous section) is that an event-driven manager
looks for individual securities that he expects to do well based on specific
events; the market timer looks for changes in general economic trends, such
as inflation and unemployment — often signaled by technical indicators —
which would show up on stock trading charts analyzed by using technical
analysis (see Chapter 5 for more information on technical analysis).
Market timing can be used long or short. Some long-short hedge fund man-
agers decide what portion of their portfolio they’ll invest outright and what
part they’ll short, based on their analysis of where the market will go.
Technical analysis doesn’t necessarily involve computers, although funds
often use technology. Technical analysis is more accurately an examination of
recent market prices. Technical analysts believe that past price behavior sig-
nals upcoming changes in price trends.
198
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 
Market calls: A sample trade
A hedge fund’s portfolio manager allocates 10
percent of the fund’s holdings to euro-denomi-
nated cash equivalents, 40 percent to U.S.
stock, and 50 percent to Japanese stock. As a
part of technical analysis, the portfolio manager
uses a complex econometric model that signals
an upcoming decline in economic conditions in
Japan, which would cause the value of the
Japanese stocks to go down and the euro to
become more valuable against the yen. The
manager sells the equivalent of 60 percent of
the portfolio as Japanese stock, shorting some
of the fund’s position, and invests the proceeds
into euros.

Putting the Power of Leverage to Use
Even a simple investing strategy — such as buying stocks in the S&P 500
index in the same proportion in order to replicate the index’s performance
(the classic index fund) — can take on new risk and return levels through the
use of leverage. Maybe you’ve heard the phrase “using other people’s
money”; that’s what leveraging is. An investor borrows money to make an
investment, getting maximum return for a minimal amount of cash up front.
Of course, this strategy can also lead to a maximum loss.
The following sections show you how to use leverage in an equity portfolio to
maximize return. But be forewarned: It’s a strategy that also increases your
risk.
Buying on margin
The simplest way to use leverage is to borrow money from the brokerage firm
that holds the investment account — called buying securities on margin. (Note:
You should never invest with a fund that doesn’t use a brokerage firm; see
Chapter 18 for more on due diligence.) The Federal Reserve Board sets the
amount that a hedge fund can borrow (the margin requirement is one of the
Fed’s many tools for maintaining financial stability). As of press time, the Board
requires individual investors to have 50 percent of the purchase prices on
account at the time they place their margin orders; they may borrow the rest of
the money from their brokerage firms. Hedge funds and other large investors
are often allowed to borrow more. You should ask about how a hedge fund
manager uses leverage as part of your due diligence (see Chapter 18).
Many brokerage firms set house limits on the total amount that hedge funds
can borrow from them, even with 50 percent of their purchase prices on
account. The house limits protect the firms from the collapse of their larger
borrowers.
After the leverage takes place, the margin borrower must meet ongoing
margin requirements. As the security bought on margin fluctuates in price,
the 50-percent purchase-price level kept on account may fall to only 30 per-
cent of the money owed. In this case, the borrower gets a margin call and has
to add money to the account to get it back to the minimum maintenance
level. If not, the brokerage firm will cash out the borrowed position. The New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and National Association of Securities Dealers
(NASD) set minimum margin requirements, although many brokerage firms
have the ability to set higher levels based on their risk-management require-
ments and their comfort levels with the clients.
199
Chapter 11: Short-Selling, Leveraging, and Other Equity Strategies

As long as a borrowed security appreciates by more than the cost of the bor-
rowing, the margin position makes money. But, because the borrowing fund
has to pay interest, margin buying is a money-losing proposition if the secu-
rity doesn’t go up.
Gaining return with other 
forms of borrowing
A hedge fund has other tools besides its brokerage firm to lift potential 
return — and potential risk. Larger hedge funds can find banks, financial
institutions, and even other hedge funds willing to lend them money that
they can use to buy securities. If you’re investing in a hedge fund, you should
expect that the fund has more sources of funds than just margin accounts.
Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that notoriously collapsed in
the summer of 1998, followed a relatively conservative investment strategy —
other than the fact that it relied almost entirely on borrowed money. The

Leverage through margin: A sample loan
A certain hedge fund buys $10,000 worth of
MicroWidget shares with $5,000 of its own cash
and with $5,000 leveraged. MicroWidget trades
at $25 per share, so the fund purchases a total
of 400 shares. The interest rate on the margin
loan is 10 percent. The following table shows
what happens as the stock price changes.

Notice that if the stock goes up from $25 to 
$40 — an increase of 60 percent — the rate of
return on the investor’s money goes up 110 per-
cent. That’s because much of the money is bor-
rowed. But note that interest still has to be paid,
which means that if the stock price is flat, the
investor is out the interest. And if the stock goes
down? The investor loses money from the stock
price and has to pay interest, dragging a 40-per-
cent decline in stock price down to a 90-percent
loss on investment.
In other words, leverage increases potential
return but also potential risk.

money was borrowed from many different banks and brokerage firms. When
the loans were called for repayment, the firm had to sell its underlying securi-
ties at low prices, which caused the fund to fall apart. The borrowing turned
a conservative investment strategy into one with high risk (see Chapter 1 for
more on this hedge fund).
Private banks often loan hedge fund investors money to get into a fund or a
fund of funds (see Chapter 15). In this case, the investor’s personal wealth is
leveraged over and above whatever leverage the fund has. The same risks
apply: If the investment goes up, the loan leads to a greater rate of return, but
if the investment heads south, the investor still has to repay the loan.

ompanies form, grow, slow down, and eventually die, and investors often
take advantage of the steps in this process. Start-up companies need ven-
ture capital and loans; mergers need financing and offer arbitrage situations
(see Chapter 10); savvy investors can short ailing stocks (see Chapter 11); and
the assets of bankrupt companies can be liquidated at a profit for people who
buy at the bottom (see Chapter 10).
As you may be able to tell from the terminology I use in the previous list,
hedge funds play a huge role in the life cycle of companies. Many hedge funds
have plenty of money to invest; they have the ability to borrow even more;
they don’t have to fund regular cash withdrawals, which means they can
make longer-term investments; and they sometimes take big risks in the hope
of generating even bigger returns.
In this chapter, I lay some groundwork by showing you, briefly, how compa-
nies are structured, and then I explain how hedge funds make money off the
corporate life cycle. If you want to invest in a hedge fund, you need to know
about these strategies so that you have a better understanding of what a par-
ticular hedge fund may be doing. The more you know, the better your ques-
tions will be, and you’ll make better decisions with your money.

Examining the Corporate Structure (And
How Hedge Funds Enter the Picture)
Hedge funds buy and sell securities based on corporate assets, and they par-
ticipate in corporate finance activities as companies move from start-up to
bankruptcy. But what does that mean? Well, allow me to get a little corporate-
finance information out of the way first. Companies have assets, which are the
goods they use to generate profit. Assets can be classified as
 Tangible assets: Like real estate, machine tools, and computers. Some
tangible assets are listed on the company’s balance sheet at the prices
that the company paid for them, even if the company purchased the
assets decades or centuries ago. Other assets are adjusted for ongoing
depreciation, leading to an accounting value that may be very different
from the actual value.
 Intangible assets: Like trademarks, patents, and secret formulas.
Intangible assets aren’t valued at all unless the company purchased
them from someone else.
Because of accounting practices, a company’s balance sheet may have no
relation to what its assets are actually worth. Coca-Cola’s secret formula, for
example, has no value as far as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP) are concerned. (The GAAP are the accounting policies used by
American corporations that must report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.)
Companies use assets to generate revenue — to produce goods or services
that people are willing to pay for. To buy assets, a company’s management
team has two choices: equity or debt. If the company issues equity, such as
shares of common stock, it takes in other owners, but it has no obligation to
repay them. If the management team decides to take on debt, such as bonds,
it takes out a loan that it must pay back.
In an efficient market, security prices should reflect all known information
about a company’s value and its prospects. But, as you may be able to attest
from your battles with work productivity, there are limits to efficiency, and
these limits create opportunities for investors. (You can find out more about
market efficiency in Chapter 6.)
Investors, such as hedge funds, buy stocks and bonds in order to make
money. If an investor buys enough stock in a company to take control, the
investor or investment team may be able to convince the company’s manage-
ment to make changes that would make more money for the investor(s). If an
204
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

investment fund owns a lot of the company bonds, and the company misses a
payment, the fund becomes the owner and has a say in the way the company
is shut down or turned around. The following sections dig deeper into the
corporate structure and show how investment decisions factor into company
proceedings.
Observing the relationship between 
owners and managers
The owners of a large company — the people who have stock — elect a board
of directors, which in turn hires the company’s management team. The board
and the management team are expected to act as agents for the owners, but
they don’t always have the same incentives to behave. The resulting issue is
known as the principal-agent problem. Some hedge fund managers look for cor-
porate situations where managements don’t act on the shareholders’ behalf;
the fund managers can try to make changes — if the funds own enough stock
in the companies — that will create profits for the funds.
For example, as of press time, Carl Icahn owned approximately 3 percent of
Time-Warner through his hedge fund. He was pushing with the company’s
CEO, Richard Parsons, to break up the company in hopes of raising the stock
price, which would generate a big profit for Icahn and the other investors in
his fund.
Obviously, the owners and managers of a company don’t have a marriage made
in heaven. Owners and managers have conflicting interests. The agents, or
management, want to maximize their personal pay scales and prestige levels,
even if their goals cause them to make decisions that aren’t in the owners’ best
interests. For example, Enron’s executives made a ton of money before that
company’s stock tanked.
However, owners aren’t always looking out for the best interests of the com-
pany, either. Bondholders want paid, and they put pressure on the company
to improve cash flow now instead of investing in the future. Shareholders
often want to maximize short-term profits, so they pressure the company to
hit a quarterly earnings number, even if it means destroying the long-run via-
bility of the business. For example, Enron’s shareholders didn’t complain
about the company’s behavior when its stock price was going up, even
though many of the company’s shenanigans were disclosed in its Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings.
205
Chapter 12: Observing How Hedge Funds Profit from the Corporate Life Cycle

Pitting business skills versus 
investment skills
Many fund managers try to make changes within companies (provided they
own enough stock in the companies) to create profits for their funds. This
strategy introduces quite a wrinkle: The skills required to run a business are
very different from those required to make investment decisions. This could
create problems for the hedge fund manager who succeeds in taking over
control of a business.
Management decisions versus investment decisions
Folks in the investment business tend to be decisive. If they see a problem
with a position, they sell it. Boom! Out of there and on to the next trade. They
don’t worry much about history, looking instead to today’s opportunities and
tomorrow’s possibilities.
People operating a company, on the other hand, have to concentrate on keep-
ing the team motivated, along with the following responsibilities:
 They have to keep customers happy.
 They have to think through problems, because the people associated
with the company have to live with the effects of management’s deci-
sions for a long time.
 They have to worry about the reputation of the business and the
strength of the brand.
Hedge funds as business managers
So, what does the difference between management decisions and investment
decisions have to do with hedge funds and you? Well, in some cases, hedge
funds are taking large enough positions in companies that they assume man-
agement roles.
For example, in 2004, Kmart announced its acquisition of Sears. ESL
Investments, a hedge fund managed by Edward Lampert, controls Kmart, and
Lampert is now calling the shots at Sears. He has improved the company’s
profitability by cutting costs and closing stores, but sales have declined
under his watch. Is that good or bad? What does it mean for the short run
and the long run? Hard to say. A company can’t stay in business if it keeps
losing money, but it also can’t stay afloat if it has no customers.
Given that the skills needed for running a business and making an investment
are very different, be sure you check out the skills of a hedge fund manager
who shows interest in operating a company owned by the fund! You can
check a manager’s skills during a due-diligence meeting with a prospective
fund (see Chapter 18).
206
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

From Ventures to Vultures: Participating
in Corporate Life Cycles
For many years, money managers would raise money from investors with a
specific type of investment strategy in mind. For example, they would invest
only in start-up companies, in distressed debt of companies near bankruptcy,
or in mergers and acquisitions. The problem with this dedicated investment
strategy is that markets run in cycles.
When the economy is strong, entrepreneurs are more likely to start their own
companies, so they need venture capital. When the economy is in trouble,
existing companies are more likely to have financial problems, so investors
can find more distressed debt in the marketplace. The managers of funds
dedicated to one strategy would have to return money to their investors
because they had no place to invest it, and the investors would be disap-
pointed because they didn’t get the risk and return that they wanted in their
overall portfolios.
This is where hedge funds come riding in on the white horse. Hedge funds 
can offer investors a level of expected return for a given level of risk, but they
rarely lock in to just one kind of investment strategy. Rather than being a 
venture-capital-only fund, a manager may set up a hedge fund to invest in pub-
licly traded or private-equity companies, either long or short (in other words,
either owning securities or selling borrowed shares in hopes that the prices
will fall; see Chapter 11), by using derivatives or leverage (see Chapters 5 and
11). That type of investment policy still sets limits for the fund manager, but
the limits aren’t so narrow that the fund can’t meet its investor’s objectives.
Given the inherent flexibility and current popularity of hedge funds, it’s no
surprise that they’re taking on a big role in corporate transactions — ranging
from venture capital and project finance to takeovers. What this means for
you, a prospective investor, is that the hedge fund you’re interested in may
be taking roles in corporate transactions. In the following sections, I describe
these transactions so you’ll understand what a hedge fund that follows this
type of strategy is doing with your money.
The many stages of the corporate life cycle give hedge funds plenty of oppor-
tunities to make money. Some funds concentrate on corporate finance trans-
actions, and others view that strategy as one of many ways to make money.
Hedge funds aren’t mutual funds. No one type of fund is suitable for all
investors, and no one type of investor is suitable for any given type of fund.
207
Chapter 12: Observing How Hedge Funds Profit from the Corporate Life Cycle

Identifying venture capital and private
equity as hedge-fund investments
Venture capital, sometimes known as private equity, is money given to entre-
preneurs to fund new companies — money that comes with strings attached.
An investor who gives the money wants to ensure that the business succeeds.
For example, it isn’t uncommon for venture capitalists to make their invest-
ments on the condition that the founders leave their companies so seasoned
managers can replace them. Hedge funds often invest in venture capital.
Although their styles may seem pushy, venture investments can help a com-
pany grow faster than it could otherwise, and investors can bring expertise —
and potential clients — to the start-ups. Some of America’s biggest technology
companies, like Intel, Oracle, Apple, and Google, were started with venture
capital. The payoff to those investors (and investors in those investors) was
huge, which is the attraction of the investment.
Return is a function of risk (see Chapter 6). Venture investors count on
acquiring some companies that will fail in their portfolios, offset by the few
companies that hit it big.
Venture capital comes in different forms. Investors from a hedge fund may
give the money to a young company as equity, making the hedge fund one of
the owners of the company. The capital can also be debt that converts into
equity if the company goes public or sells out to a larger company. The struc-
ture depends on the start-up company’s business and state of profitability.
Venture-capital investors need a liquidity event to make money. This event
occurs when a company is sold to a larger one or when it issues stock through
an Initial Public Offering, or IPO. Until that event happens, the venture investor
won’t make much money.
The following list presents the most common forms of venture capital that
you’re likely to encounter when scoping out hedge funds (including private
equity, which deals with established companies, making it not quite venture
capital, but close):
 Late-stage venture. After a new company gets over the initial hurdles of
setting up the business and attracting customers, it becomes a lot more
interesting to investors, who see a little less risk with some huge upside.
The company still needs more money to grow, and it still isn’t ready to
go public or to be acquired. Investing at a later stage makes a lot of
sense for hedge funds that want to make private equity investments, but
not as primary business strategies.
208
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

 Mezzanine capital. When a young company needs just enough financing
to move it to the stage where it can go public or be an attractive acquisi-
tion, it needs mezzanine financing. Mezzanine capital is the least risky
stage of venture capital (although it’s still riskier than investing in a public
company) because a company’s management has proved that the busi-
ness is viable. The company just needs a little more time before it can
appear on the stock markets because the current market conditions
would limit how much money the company could make. Returns are likely
to be higher with a company at this stage than with public companies,
though, so this stage of venture investing is interesting to hedge funds.
 Private equity. Many established companies choose not to be publicly
traded; other companies are publicly traded but can’t raise money effi-
ciently through a public offering. These companies turn to private equity
deals, often with hedge funds on the other side. These transactions
carry lower potential returns than venture capital because they carry
less risk (the company is established), but they often carry higher
returns than shares of common stock in similar companies because it’s
harder to sell private equity.
Private investments in public equity, deals that sometimes go by the
acronym PIPE, are less common than conventional private equity 
deals because companies that are already publicly traded issue them.
Issuing public stock is expensive, though, and it’s sometimes prohibitive
for a public company to raise more money that way. A private invest-
ment in public equity allows a company to sell more stock, but only to
accredited investors (including hedge funds) who agree not to sell for at
least two years. This is just one of many types of offbeat investments
that you may come across while you’re investigating hedge funds.
 Seed capital. Money used to take an idea and turn it into a business is
called seed capital. Some hedge funds provide seed capital, but only if
they know the people and technology involved. For the most part, entre-
preneurs have to fund companies themselves or with money from friends
and family (sometimes called angel investors). With that money, they can
prove their concepts to be sound and get their companies running before
they turn to other investors for expansion funds.
Few hedge funds do seed capital deals. Because they aren’t in the pri-
mary business of venture capital, most hedge funds prefer to wait to see
if a company has a chance of surviving.
Project finance: Are hedge 
funds replacing banks?
When a company needs to borrow money, it can go to a bank, or it can go 
to an investment fund that has money to lend and that’s looking to make a
209
Chapter 12: Observing How Hedge Funds Profit from the Corporate Life Cycle

return on it. On the flip side of the coin, when a company has excess money
and wants to make a return on it, it can deposit the money at a bank, or it can
loan the money to an investment fund that needs it.
Hedge funds may have money to lend, or they may need money to invest.
When it comes to short-term transactions — sometimes as short as 
overnight — hedge funds often replace banks in the role of taking deposits
and lending money. When they lend money, hedge funds are paid interest,
which contributes to the return of the fund.
Corporations may turn to hedge funds rather than banks for all sorts of rea-
sons, including the following:
 A company may need to borrow money for a day or two in order to meet
payroll until its customers pay their bills.
 Company executives may need funds for a specific, risky project, and 
a hedge fund manager may be more willing to take on the risk than a
bank’s loan officer.
 In the event of a corporate takeover — especially a hostile one (see the
section “Investing in troubled and dying companies with vulture funds”
later in this chapter) — the buying group needs to raise a lot of money.
 Commercial or investment banks may not have the money to lend, or
they may not be able to lend because they have relationships with the
target companies. Hedge fund managers can turn over their funds at
prices that make the deals worthwhile for them.
Hedge funds borrow money from banks, and they compete with them at the
same time. It’s unclear if the banks will let this situation go on forever, but for
now, you may well be able to take advantage of it through your hedge-fund
investment.
Borrowing
Most hedge funds use leverage to increase their potential return, which
means that they borrow money to buy securities, increasing the amount of
money that they can make relative to the amount of money actually in the
funds. Hedge fund managers are always looking to make the largest possible
amount of money at the lowest possible rate. They borrow from other hedge
funds, from banks, from brokerage firms, and sometimes from large corpora-
tions (see Chapter 11 for more on leveraging).
Many corporations have money sitting around that they won’t need for a few
days. A company’s executives want to get the maximum possible return on
their funds, so they lend the money out, often only overnight. But for the
210
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

hedge fund on the other side of the transaction, overnight may be exactly
enough time to take advantage of a profitable price discrepancy between two
securities. The borrowed funds may allow for a small profit in percentage
terms to become a large profit relative to the fund’s total size. Because it’s
unlikely (but not out of the question) that the borrower will go out of busi-
ness in such a short period, this type of transaction carries very little risk.
Lending
One way a hedge fund manager tries to generate a high rate of return relative
to a given level of risk is to keep the fund’s holdings earning returns at all
times. Therefore, if he sees money in one account that isn’t being used for
one of the fund’s investments, he may decide to loan it out, even for a short
period, to get some amount of return. Hedge funds receive interest when they
loan out money; of course, the funds take on the risk that the borrowers
won’t repay the money.
Some hedge fund managers are willing to loan out money for longer periods
of time — even a few years — to corporations or governments that need
money. They can do this by buying bonds (as can any investor, because
bonds are simply tradable loans), or they can make loans through private
transactions. They can create all kinds of risk and return combinations by
lending money, depending on the funds’ goals and the market opportunities.
Gaining return from company 
mergers and acquisitions
Companies are bought and sold all the time. Certain companies decide to join
forces with other companies instead of going it alone. Large companies buy
smaller companies in order to build market share, add links in the supply
chain, or expand internationally. In other words, a merger is a combination of
equals, and an acquisition is the purchase of a smaller business by a larger one.
Acquisitions take place all the time. Most big mergers, on the other hand,
don’t work out over the long run, but that doesn’t mean they don’t happen.
And no matter the long-term prospects of a merger or acquisition, in the
short term, there’s money to be made. Hedge funds, which are in the busi-
ness of making money, are often players in mergers and acquisitions by pro-
viding funding and speculating on the outcomes. The following sections
outline certain situations funds look for and the strategies they use to
increase return and put money in your pocket.
211
Chapter 12: Observing How Hedge Funds Profit from the Corporate Life Cycle

Leveraged (management) buyouts
Sometimes, a company’s management group becomes fed up with its share-
holders and the hassles of having publicly traded shares. The members of the
group have reason to believe they could make more money if they ran the com-
pany themselves, so they decide to raise the money to take over. Because it
involves heavy borrowing, this type of transaction is called a leveraged buyout
(LBO) in the United States; because the management group is doing the buying,
the transaction is called a management buyout (MBO) in Europe.
Many hedge funds invest in LBO debt because it tends to be riskier than most
corporate debt. The risk comes from the management group’s decision to
borrow most or all of the money needed for the acquisition.
Buyout funds
Buyout funds are investment pools formed by hedge fund managers and other
private investors for the express purpose of funding leveraged buyouts (see
the previous section) and business expansions. Like venture capital funds
(see the section “Identifying venture capital and private equity as hedge-fund
investments”), buyout funds tend to go in and out of fashion, and funds often
see mismatches between the amount of money raised to invest in buyouts
and the need for buyout capital.
Some hedge fund managers consider investing in buyouts to be one of many
strategies at their disposal for generating alpha (the excess return that hedge
funds seek to generate due to manager performance; see Chapter 6 for more
information). They can provide funding in buyout situations, invest in junk
bonds (which offer higher returns than regular bonds; see Chapter 5), and
then move on to other strategies when market conditions change. The new
strategies may be related to buyouts — a fund manager who invests in buy-
outs will probably be interested in other forms of corporate finance and debt
rather than currency transactions or commodity pools — but they’ll help the
funds meet their return objectives regardless of the business cycle. It’s
unlikely that you’ll come across a hedge fund dedicated solely to buyouts;
instead, it will be one of many strategies that a hedge fund manager may use.
Bridge lending
Hedge funds that want to loan money may work with companies that are
looking to acquire other companies. At least in the short run, a company
looking to acquire may need some financing to acquire shares in the market
or otherwise support its bid for another company. A loan from a hedge fund
in this situation is called a bridge loan or bridge financing. Bridge loans usu-
ally have terms of less than one year and carry higher interest rates than
other forms of short-term financing not available to the company, for what-
ever reason. A bridge loan is one of many investments that a hedge fund may
consider to meet its risk and return objectives.

Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Merger arbitrage
Merger arbitrage is a low-risk trading strategy designed to profit after a corpo-
rate merger or acquisition is announced (see Chapter 10 for more on the
topic). In general, the shares of the company about to be acquired trade at a
discount to the offer price because you take on some risk that the deal won’t
go through. A hedge fund trader buys the stock of the target company and
sells the stock of the acquirer, waiting until the deal is announced for the gap
to close at a nice profit.
Investing in troubled and dying 
companies with vulture funds
Insiders often use a slang term for investment pools that seek out troubled
businesses and troubled countries — vulture funds. In some ways, vulture
funds are the opposite of venture capital funds: The venture funds profit as
the companies get going, and vulture funds are there to profit at the end of
the corporate life cycle.
Many hedge fund managers run their funds as vulture funds at least some of
the time, but they probably don’t like that label for their strategy. If a fund’s
traders see that a nation’s currency has weakened or that some bonds are in
risk of default, they swoop in, buy as much as they can, and then use their
positions as negotiating leverage to get a profit for the fund. Fund traders
may also take large positions in the equity and debt of a troubled company
and then force management to sell off divisions and other assets.
Other hedge funds inadvertently take on the vulture-fund role. For example, 
a fund may have a large stake in the debt of a company that goes bankrupt,
giving the fund manager a stake in the proceedings. Naturally, his goal is to
get the maximum possible return (which may be the smallest loss).
Several investment strategies prey on troubled businesses, including hostile
takeovers, liquidation arbitrage, and shareholder activism, to name a few. I
cover these strategies and more in the following sections.
Hostile takeovers
A hostile takeover occurs when a company or an investment group acquires
enough common stock in a company to get control of its board of directors.
In some cases, the company or investment group believes that it can operate
the business more profitably. In other cases, the acquirer simply wants to sell
off the company’s assets at a profit.
213
Chapter 12: Observing How Hedge Funds Profit from the Corporate Life Cycle

A hedge fund may offer financing to another takeover group, or it can buy
enough stock to be a part of one. Both strategies can be profitable, so I dis-
cuss some of the nuances of takeovers in the following subsections.
Hostility is in the eyes of the beholder. Employees of the doomed company
may see a takeover bid as hostile, but the management group sees a payout
and the shareholders see a nice profit.
Section 13(d) filings
Under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, an investment
group has to file a notice with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission as soon as it acquires 5 percent or more of a company’s stock. 
A filing investor needs to indicate if the holding is for investment purposes
(in which case the filing falls under Section 13[g]) or is part of an attempt to
influence a company’s management or to seek control (a 13[d] filing).
After a hedge fund manager files a 13(d) statement, he makes his fund’s inten-
tions public, and the stock price of the company to be taken over will react.
The news reaction may put pressure on the company’s management, so the
fund manager may try to negotiate with management before he files the
paperwork. He can take a couple different paths here:
 He may ask the company to buy back stock in the open market, pay a
dividend, or sell off a division to increase the value of the stock.
 He may make an offer for the rest of the shares, which management 
and the board of directors may accept on their behalf (see the following
section).
In some cases, a 13(d) filing inspires other investors to come forward and
identify themselves if they have opinions on the validity of the hedge fund
manager’s request. If the stock has been underperforming the market, for
example, other investors will probably side with the fund, putting more pres-
sure on management to make changes. One example of this happened with
Pep Boys, the auto-service company. In August 2006, a group of four hedge
funds got together to force the company to add more directors to its board
and make changes to its shareholder-rights policies.
Tender offers
If negotiations with a company’s management group fail, the investment
group organizing the hostile takeover turns to a tender offer. A tender offer is
a legal offer to buy shares, usually at a price above the current market price.
The offer is distributed to all shareholders, and they can decide if the tender
is a good deal or if they’d rather stay put.
214
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

A hedge fund may be behind the tender offer, or it may provide funding to a
hostile bidder so that she can buy the shares that are tendered to her. Another
option is that the fund could engage in arbitrage between the tender price and
the current market price (see Chapter 10). Tender offers are rare, but they pre-
sent a range of money-making opportunities for hedge fund managers who
want to pick them up.
Liquidation arbitrage
Liquidation arbitrage is an investment technique that looks to profit from the
breakup of a firm (see Chapter 10 for more on the topic). An investor does
careful research to determine exactly how a company’s market value differs
from the value of the sum of its parts. The investor seeks to find out certain
pieces of information, such as the following:
 Are people overlooking the value of the firm’s real estate?
 Does the company have an art collection that could fetch a fancy price
at auction?
 Does the company have patents that could be really useful to another
company?
 Does the corporation hold mineral rights in a region where oil has just
been discovered?
And so on. If the investment fund, often a hedge fund, finds an opportunity
where the actual value of the company looks very different from the market
value, the fund can acquire enough shares to force management to break the
company up or at least sell off some of the assets at a gain for shareholders.
Liquidation arbitrage is perfectly legal as long as it isn’t based on material
nonpublic information. Many analysts rely on what’s called the mosaic theory,
which holds that small pieces of immaterial nonpublic information can be
pieced together to make a legal investment decision. The problem is how to
define materiality. The courts have generally defined material information as
information that would make a rational investor buy or sell a security. In
practice, most insider-trading cases — some of which have featured merger
and liquidation arbitrageurs — involve plea bargains before trial or charges
on provable information. Martha Stewart, for example, went to prison for
obstruction of justice, not for insider trading.
Activist investing
Many hedge fund managers who work in supposed “vulture funds” prefer to
be known as shareholder activists, which are investors who push management
groups to make changes for the good of the businesses, the employees, and
the shareholders. Both true activists and raiders who don the activist guise
are in the news a lot these days.
215
Chapter 12: Observing How Hedge Funds Profit from the Corporate Life Cycle

The leader in activist-investing circles is the California Public Employees
Retirement System, also known as CalPERS. It controls $207 billion in assets,
which it uses to provide pensions to 1.4 million people who work for state
and local governments in California. Outside money managers oversee most
of the money, including investors at several different hedge funds, but
CalPERS executives keep close watch on where the money goes. Starting in
1987, CalPERS created an annual list of six or so companies that had poor
performances, due in large part to problems with management and corporate
governance. CalPERS executives made it clear to these companies that they
expected changes or they’d put their votes to work. Many others in the
investment world are willing to align with CalPERS against management
teams because CalPERS has a reputation for being credible and effective.
Proxy battles
A public company is structured as a democracy, at least in theory, with each
share of stock representing a vote in the company. Companies send ballot
statements called proxies to their shareholders each year, giving shareholders
the opportunity to vote on the members of the boards of directors, executive
compensation plans, and certain other matters. The members of the boards
then determine other aspects of running the businesses, including hiring man-
agement, developing long-range strategies, and approving acquisitions.
In practice, a public company isn’t very democratic. If an outsider, such as a
hedge fund, acquires enough shares in the company, it can often have pro-
posals added to the proxy and can present its own slate of candidates for 
the board of directors — candidates who presumably would push for big
changes upon election. The outside fund that takes this course has to con-
vince folks who hold a majority of the shares to vote with it. Proxy battles
rarely succeed in getting new directors elected, but they often push manage-
ment to make needed changes in the running of the company.

Macro Funds: Looking 
for Global Trends
In This Chapter

 Highlighting special issues for macro funds
 Investing with currencies and commodities
O
ur big world is constantly changing. Nations develop their economies,
and nations decline. Interest rates go up in some places and down in
others. Currency prices change, commodity prices fluctuate, and govern-
ments are overthrown. The one thing that remains constant is that many
hedge fund managers want to profit from all the upheaval.
When looking at the way nations function, economists talk about macroeco-
nomics. Macroeconomic factors include prices, employment, inflation, indus-
trial production, corporate profits, tax receipts, imports, and exports. Funds
based on macroeconomic factors are known as macro funds. (For whatever
reason, everyone likes the slang term better; you hear “macro” more than
“macroeconomic,” so that’s what I use here.)
Some of the biggest and most glamorous hedge funds are macro funds. Good
macro funds tend to be huge because they need a lot of capital to take posi-
tions all over the world, and they need to generate high fees to cover their
operating costs. Because of their size, macro funds tend to deal mostly with
the largest investment institutions and the wealthiest individuals. Examples
of macro funds include funds run by such legendary managers as George
Soros and Julian Robertson, whose returns drew people’s attention to hedge
funds. Macro funds such as these are the funds that dictators complain
about, that traders want to work for, and that end up in the headlines.
By looking at securities around the world, hedge fund managers can often
increase returns relative to domestic stocks, with an entirely different risk
profile. Macro funds invest in the markets, currencies, and commodities that

the world market expects to do well and sell short those securities that have
a less-than-rosy outlook (see Chapter 11 for more on shorting). Some macro
funds have had an enormous effect on exchange rates in certain developing
countries. Because of that, a macro hedge fund is often reviled in the popular
media. Is that fair? That’s for you to decide.
In this chapter, I discuss how fiscal and monetary policy affect investment
values, highlight the issues that are unique to macro funds, and talk about
currency and commodity investments, which are especially popular with
macro investors. After reading this chapter, you’ll have a better understand-
ing of what macro funds do to reach their risk and return goals.
Fathoming Macroeconomics
Macroeconomic factors play together in different ways, and a fund can’t look
at a single factor alone. For example, when employment is low, so is inflation,
in general. After all, workers don’t have money to buy anything if they’re not
working. High levels of industrial production are great, unless the workers
are producing items that people don’t want. Low taxes may stimulate busi-
nesses to produce more profits and give individual consumers more money
to spend, or they may deprive a government from the money it needs to func-
tion or lead to government employees who demand large bribes to offset
paltry salaries.
Political decisions that have nothing to do with how markets function can
muddy macroeconomic analysis. Watch out for a hedge fund manager who
applies the conventional wisdom of his home country or his favorite political
party; he may make really bad decisions overseas.
An analysis of macroeconomics can bring the expectations of a given coun-
try’s economy to light, possibly pointing a hedge fund manager toward
money-making opportunities. An analysis can also drop hints about how a
government may respond to different economic events. And yes, govern-
ments have a few tools at their disposal, too — namely fiscal policy and mon-
etary policy. I cover these topics in the sections that follow.
Focusing on fiscal policy
Governments collect taxes to spend on running their countries and on infra-
structure investments, such as highways, airports, and sanitation systems.
As much as some idealists like to believe in free and unfettered capitalism,
218
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

some of these functions are necessary. For example, a country with a govern-
ment that enforces intellectual property is a better place for a technology
business than a country where piracy is rampant. Also, a nation without good
public schools won’t have a large number of highly productive workers.
The key for an administration is to balance taxes with the needs for govern-
ment services. If taxes are too high, businesses won’t invest. If taxes are too
low, governments can’t provide necessary services.
If a government doesn’t raise enough money from taxes, however, it can
borrow from investors, including hedge funds, by issuing bonds. If the bor-
rowed money goes into good infrastructure investments, the country’s econ-
omy will be better off. Just as many individuals borrow money to buy houses
that will provide years of shelter for their families, governments borrow
money to build highways and modernize airports. On the other end of the
spectrum, just as some individuals charge their credit cards up to the limits
rather than cut back or find jobs that pay more, some governments borrow
money when their politicians lack the will or the ability to increase taxes or
cut spending. Government borrowing affects the supply of securities for
investors to buy, the level of interest rates in an economy, and the infrastruc-
ture in a country. 
Making moves with monetary policy
National governments have one huge tool for influencing the economy: the
printing press. As long as it’s willing and able to print money, a government
can meet payments on all its debt. Monetary policy is a government’s strat-
egy for managing the money supply.
Hedge funds have other considerations when it comes to monitoring monetary
policy across the globe. The following sections dive into these considerations.
Governments with too much money
The more money a government has in circulation, the more prices will rise
because more money is chasing a smaller amount of goods. At an extreme,
people need huge amounts of paper money to meet everyday expenses. After
World War I, Germany was ordered to pay reparations to the countries that it
targeted. Germany’s leaders decided to print enough money to meet the pay-
ments, which drove down the value of all the money in the country. The result
was hyperinflation, which drove prices higher. No wallet was big enough;
people took sacks and wheelbarrows full of money to shops to buy groceries.
219
Chapter 13: Macro Funds: Looking for Global Trends

Many investors hold onto the belief that governments never default on their
bonds because they can always print money to meet their loan payments.
However, because printing extra money leads to high inflation at home, not
all governments are willing to go this route. In the summer of 1998, Russia
decided to default on its debt rather than print more money, which proved
disastrous for Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that had bor-
rowed money to acquire exposure to Russian bonds and related securities
(see Chapter 1 for a full rundown of this infamous hedge fund).
Governments with too little money
If too little money is circulating in a nation’s economy, its banks and investors
have no funds to give to businesses and individuals with worthwhile projects.
Prices keep falling to levels where people can afford to buy goods, and in
some cases, prices fall so low that companies can’t stay in business. This
economic state is called deflation, and the effects are more punishing than
those of any increase in price levels (see Chapter 6 for more on the topic).
The United States suffered from deflation in the 1930s, leading to a long
period of high unemployment. Japan also had a long deflationary era in the
1990s and into the 21st century. Japan has avoided anything on the scale of
the Great Depression, but the country has seen little economic growth or
investment for years.
Money is more than currency
Because money comes in the form of credit cards, checks, electronic trans-
fers, and paper and metal currency, the total amount of money in an economy
can be very different from how much the Treasury prints up. This is one
reason why hedge fund managers and other investors have so many securi-
ties available for investing.
Here’s an example of how non-paper money works. As I write this book, I turn
in the chapters to my editor. Whenever I hit a certain number of chapters, the
folks at Wiley cut a paper check toward my advance and send it to my agent.
My agent puts the money in her bank and then sends me a paper check for the
advance less her fees. I take the paper check to my bank. Later in the month, I
make several electronic transfers from my checking account to my credit card
company, my utility companies, and the mutual fund company that holds my
SEP-IRA account. I take out only a small part of the check in the form of cash
for incidental expenses. If you look only at how much money I have in my
wallet, you’d have a very bad idea of how much money I actually have.
Non-currency money and interest rates
One way that a government can influence all its non-currency forms of money
is by manipulating interest rates. Some governments can do this by decree;
others, like the United States, do it in more subtle ways. In the United States,
220
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

the Federal Reserve Bank (often called the Fed) requires that all member banks
keep a certain percentage of their total deposits in the form of currency. If a
bank needs more currency, it borrows from the Federal Reserve Bank; the rate
charged is the Fed discount rate. If a bank has too much paper money and coins
on hand, it deposits the excess money with the Fed; the rate paid on this is the
Fed funds rate. The Fed generally meets every six weeks to discuss the levels of
these rates, a process that investors follow closely.
The Fed manipulates the economy by putting businesses, consumers, and
investors on puppet strings, so to speak:
 If the Fed wants businesses, consumers, and investors to take money
out of the economy and into savings, it raises the Fed funds rate. Banks,
seeing that they can get better returns, raise the rates they pay on sav-
ings accounts to encourage customers to bring money in and put it on
deposit.
 If the Fed wants businesses, consumers, and investors to spend more
money, it raises the Fed discount rate, which encourages banks to lower
their costs by lending out money rather than keeping funds in deposits.
The Fed sets the Fed funds rate and the Fed discount rate to move the econ-
omy in the direction that its Board of Governors thinks is most appropriate.
Many other nations have central banks that behave in a similar way. A hedge
fund manager who correctly anticipates central-bank movements can make a
lot of money.
Here’s an example: A manager sees that a nation’s economy is growing really
fast and predicts that inflation will become a factor in the future. She sus-
pects that the nation’s central bank will use its tools to increase interest rates
in order to encourage people to save more and spend less, thus bringing
prices down. If interest rates go up in the nation, bond prices will go down.
Therefore, she decides to borrow money to buy put options on the bonds —
a highly leveraged transaction that pays off when rates go up (see Chapter 5
for more on options and Chapter 11 for more on leveraging).
Taking Special Issues for Macro 
Funds into Consideration
Hedge fund managers consider several factors unique to macro funds, as well
as some that apply to the asset classes (especially currency) most used by
macro funds (see Chapter 9 for more on asset classes). The following sec-
tions cover the most common issues that funds are likely to encounter.
221
Chapter 13: Macro Funds: Looking for Global Trends

Diversified, yes. Riskless, no.
One of the best ways to hedge risk is to diversify (see Chapter 6 for a detailed
discussion of risk). A macro fund does just that by investing in many different
markets and by using many different asset classes to profit from expected
changes in the global macroeconomy.
However, although a macro fund may hold a mix of currencies, commodities,
index derivatives, and bonds, it retains exposure to the one or two factors
that the hedge fund manager identifies as important. If a fund manager
expects a shift in European interest rates, for example, his portfolio will
reflect that position, and if the rates don’t move as expected, the fund’s per-
formance can suffer (causing suffering for investors’ wallets).
Global financial expertise
A macro fund manager needs to know a lot about many different places in the
world. These managers tend to be steeped in practical economics — what
drives inflation, what moves exchange rates, what trade deficits mean, and so
on. They tend to have highly quantitative approaches to the market, caring
more about raw numbers than the stories behind them. Macro managers are
world travelers, but not always; they still have to love sitting on trading
desks and making bets on market movements. A money manager with a sta-
tistics PhD who has never been out of the country may be a better macro
manager than a polyglot with a worn-out passport. These are some things to
think about during your due diligence (see Chapter 18).
Subadvisers
Some savvy macro hedge funds subcontract to local advisers in foreign mar-
kets to get on-the-ground perspectives. For example, an American may not
understand the Mexican market as well as a Mexican who works in Mexico
City, so a macro fund manager who wants to invest in that market may sub-
contract some of the money-management duties to a local investment com-
pany. This strategy may lead to higher fees for the fund, but you’ll see the
benefit when the fees are offset by higher returns.
The multinational conundrum
One of the more interesting aspects of the global economy is how few compa-
nies or countries operate in isolation. For example, the largest U.S., European,
and Asian companies operate around the world. Shares of Coca-Cola, Unilever,
222
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

and Sony are almost equally exposed within the economies of the United
States, Europe, and Japan. American retailers depend on sourcing from
China, and Chinese investors buy American government bonds.
This makes it tough, but not impossible, for a macro fund manager to isolate
exposure to only one part of the world’s economy. The trick is to carefully
weight the fund and use derivatives (see Chapter 9). As often happens, the
fund manager starts by running a regression model, which is a statistical analy-
sis of how a security’s price moves relative to other factors in the economy.
Here’s an example: A macro fund manager believes that the European econ-
omy is going to improve, which will drive up prices of European stocks. She
buys shares in the biggest companies on the continent and then runs a
regression analysis to see how much exposure these stocks have to the U.S.
and the Japanese stock markets. She sells futures on U.S. and Japanese
market indexes to remove those risks from the portfolio (see Chapter 5 for
more on futures and options).
Widening or Narrowing 
Your Macro Scope
Macro hedge fund managers look for opportunities at home and abroad.
They don’t like to be limited to any one asset class, as long as they can profit
from fundamental economic changes. But the world is a big place, so many
macro funds try to narrow their focus in the hopes that familiarity will help
them identify opportunities before other market participants do. Many hedge
funds that adopt the label “macro fund” are really somewhere between macro
and micro.
When you research macro and other international funds, you may gain the
following bits of knowledge:
 Global funds invest everywhere. A global fund is open to all markets in
the world, including the fund’s home market. A global fund based in the
United States, for example, invests in U.S. assets as well as assets else-
where in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. This
strategy gives the global fund manager the freedom to choose whatever
markets present the best opportunities. On the flip side, it may not give
you, the fund investor, the best diversification — especially if the rest of
your portfolio concentrates on domestic assets.
223
Chapter 13: Macro Funds: Looking for Global Trends

 International funds invest outside the home market. Hedge funds that
invest everywhere in the world but in the funds’ domestic markets are
known as international funds. These funds offer more diversification ben-
efits for home-market investors, but they give the fund managers fewer
options for investing.
 Regional funds look at specific markets. Many macro fund managers
believe the investing world is too big, even when they exclude their
domestic markets. These funds choose to pursue macro strategies, but
they limit investments to only a few of the world’s markets. Some of
these funds are obvious in their intentions — Asia-Pacific funds invest in
markets located in Asia and on the Pacific Ocean, for example — but
others are less obvious, so I define them here (no need for thanks . . . I’m
here for you!):
• BRIC — Brazil, Russia, India, China: BRIC funds are all the rage
these days because Brazil, Russia, India, and China offer a combi-
nation of large and relatively well-educated populations, a move
toward modernization from relatively undeveloped bases, and rela-
tively stable governments that seem to be supporting capitalistic
endeavors. Yet, these four nations are at early enough stages in
development that investors have high growth expectations, and
high premiums are paid in return for taking on the risk of investing
in these markets.
• EAFE (pronounced EEE-fah): Short for Morgan Stanley Capital
International’s Europe, Australasia, and Far East index, EAFE cap-
tures the performance of the most developed markets in the world,
making it a widely used approach to international investing. The
approach leaves out many emerging markets, so an EAFE portfolio
may limit growth opportunities.
• Eurozone: The definition of Europe seems obvious, but it isn’t
always. Some nations are physically located in Europe, some
nations are members of the European Union, and some nations use
the euro for currency. There’s some overlap. The Eurozone, how-
ever, is a narrow definition that applies only to nations that use the
euro, notably excluding the United Kingdom and Switzerland.
Big returns in foreign currency sometimes disappear when converted back to
the home currency. The problem compounds if your home currency is different
from the macro fund’s. A macro hedge fund based in London that makes a
killing in yen, for example, may not have such a stellar return for a U.S. investor
after the yen convert to pounds and the pounds convert to dollars.
Coming to terms with currencies
Macro funds use currencies to capture the underlying economic changes in
countries without creating too much of a ripple in the prices. They can follow
224
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

this strategy because the currency markets dwarf the markets for other asset
classes. As of press time, Microsoft’s market capitalization is $280 billion;
marketable U.S. government bonds total $4.3 trillion; but the U.S. money
supply is $6.7 trillion.
This section discusses the trading of currencies and the factors that affect
their values so you can better understand how hedge funds may use curren-
cies to meet their risk and return goals.
Trading currencies
Hedge funds that want to make money from currencies can do it a few differ-
ent ways, depending on market opportunities and the structure of their port-
folios. For example, a fund can buy a currency straight up or it can work with
derivatives. The following list outlines some options that macro funds have:
 Spot: If a fund pays the going price for a security and gets it immediately,
this means that it has bought it in the spot market. The spot market for
sandwiches is whatever the local sub shop charges you today for a sand-
wich today. The spot market for yen is whatever a bank charges you to
exchange your dollars for yen today.
Hedge funds buy and sell currencies in the spot market, often by trans-
ferring money between bank accounts in different markets. They can
keep the money in those accounts and hold it until its value changes, 
or they can use the money to make other investments in the markets.
Hedge funds can also borrow money in different markets (or leverage
money; see Chapter 11); if they get their loan proceeds today, they’ve
made spot-market transactions.
 Derivatives: Derivatives are contracts that draw their value from the
value of underlying assets (you can find a description of derivatives in
Chapter 5).
 Options: Currency options give a buyer the right, but not the obligation,
to buy or sell a currency at a set exchange rate at some point in the future.
These options allow macro fund managers to profit from changes in
exchange rates without committing capital. They also allow funds to set
up complex trades, which are the stock-in-trade of most macro funds.
 Swaps: A swap is an exchange of interest-rate payments in two different
currencies. A swap allows you to better match your income with your
expenses in a given currency, or it can allow you to increase your port-
folio’s exposure to a given currency, if that’s feasible.
Exchange rate regimes
Much of my discussion in the section up to this point assumes that curren-
cies are freely floating; however, they aren’t in many markets. A free-floating
currency goes up or down in value with supply and demand. If consumers
want more of a currency — to buy a country’s goods or to invest in that
225
Chapter 13: Macro Funds: Looking for Global Trends

country’s market — they’re willing to pay more of their home currency to get
the foreign currency they need. They can go this route only if the currency
floats. The dollar, the euro, and the yen are among the largest free-floating
currencies in the world.
Other currencies are fixed — a county’s government sets the exchange rate 
and its central bankers are instructed to buy and sell securities and set interest
rates as necessary to maintain the relationship. The Chinese yuan trades at a
rate of eight yuan to one U.S. dollar, for example, and the rate barely fluctuates.
Some governments allow their currencies to fluctuate, but only within narrow
bands. Of course, if investors have reason to believe that a government will
allow its fixed-rate currency to float, or if investors believe the pegs used to
set the exchange rate may change, they have the potential to make some
handsome profit. For example, many people think that the yuan is grossly
undervalued relative to the dollar as of this writing. The question is, how
long will you have to wait until the Chinese government allows the exchange
rate to go to six yuan per dollar?
Markets seem global in nature, but they aren’t as closely linked as you may
think. Many nations don’t fully participate in world markets — ranging in size
from China, where the currency doesn’t freely fluctuate, to underdeveloped
countries with painfully small and impoverished economies. On occasion,
trades take place involving unusual assets, but these trades are usually nego-
tiated (sometimes under the table) or come with high transaction costs. 
If a hedge fund manager tells you about great arbitrage opportunities (see
Chapter 10) between the Malawi kwacha and the Chinese yuan during a 
discussion or due-diligence interview (see Chapter 18), you should be 
suspicious.
Determining exchange rates
An exchange rate is simply the price of money, and like all prices, supply and
demand determines the rate. Simple enough, but what determines how much
money is supplied and how much money is demanded? That’s where things
get a little more complicated. A hedge fund manager can use several different
approaches to find out if exchange rates are out of line. If exchange rates are
slightly off where they should be, a manager can engage in arbitrage, for
example (see Chapter 10); if the rates are way off, she can take large specula-
tive positions and wait for the necessary events to pass.
The more home currency it takes to buy a foreign currency, the more valu-
able the foreign currency is. If the foreign currency starts to cost less relative
to the home currency, the foreign currency is said to be depreciating in value.
For example, if 1 U.S. dollar buys 117 yen today, and if it can buy 125 yen a
year from now, the price of yen has depreciated.
226
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Interest-rate parity
Interest-rate parity says that you can explain the difference between two cur-
rencies with the difference in the market rate of interest in each country
(which is the rate of interest that’s currently quoted in that market). The
ratio of the future rate (the rate for currency traded in the future) to the spot
rate (the rate for currency traded today) should be the ratio of the home
interest rate to the foreign interest rate. If an investor sees a difference, he
can take advantage of an arbitrage opportunity (see Chapter 10 for more on
arbitrage). And if a fund manager has reason to think that interest rates are
going to change, he can use the relation between the future rate and the spot
rate to take advantage by investing in currencies.
Here’s an example of this process: Suppose you have $100,000 to invest for
one year. You have two choices: You can invest the money at home at the cur-
rent interest rate, or you can trade your money for foreign currency, invest in
that country at its interest rate, and then hedge your exchange-rate risk by
selling forward the future value of the foreign currency investment. Because
both of these investments have the same risk, they must have the same
future value, which means that the difference in the exchange rate is the dif-
ference in the interest rates.
Table 13-1 shows how this process works. In an efficient market (see Chapter 6
for more on efficiency), exchange rates should be set so that it doesn’t matter
what country you borrow from or lend money to; your proceeds should be the
same after everything converts back.

The last figure is the £720,000 due at the end of the year, multiplied by the
£1.48 forward rate.
Macro fund managers look for situations where interest rates and exchange
rates differ. If the Canadian/U.K. exchange rate doesn’t quite reflect expected
differences in interest rates, a fund manager can convert Canadian funds to
pounds and invest them in the U.K. and then exchange the proceeds at the
forward rate to lock in a riskless profit. Sure, this strategy produces a small
percentage gain, but if the manager couples it with a leverage strategy (the
use of borrowed money to conduct the transaction; see Chapter 11), returns
can be much greater. Table 13-2 presents this example.

Purchasing-power parity
Purchasing-power parity is a weird concept. It says that a particular good made
and sold in one country should cost exactly the same as the same good made
and sold in another after the currency is translated.
For example, the Icelandic krona price of a sweater made in Iceland and sold
in Iceland should be equal to the Icelandic krona price of a sweater made in
Ireland and sold in Ireland. Otherwise, a savvy retailer would buy sweaters in
228
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

a cheap market to sell them in a more expensive market. As you shoppers out
there in reading land may know, these two sweaters could be very different —
different styles, different grades of wool, different dye techniques, different
brand names or logos, and so on. So, in the real world, it doesn’t make much
sense that these two sweaters should be the same sweaters, let alone trade at
the same price.
There are two refinements of the basic concept of purchasing-power parity.
The first looks at a list of goods rather than one specific item. You draw up a
list of goods and services and shop around in Iceland in Icelandic krona and
in Ireland in euros. If the Icelandic krona price of the Irish items is the same
as the Icelandic krona price of the Icelandic items, purchasing-power parity
holds up.
Editors at The Economist, a British newsweekly with an international reader
base, have come up with a model of purchasing-power parity by using the
McDonald’s Big Mac, which is sourced locally, using local labor, but which is
made to the exact same specifications everywhere in the world. If purchasing-
power parity holds, a Big Mac in Boston should cost the same as a Big Mac in
Bangkok. If not, there may be a discrepancy in the exchange rates that will
correct over time. The Big Mac index isn’t perfect, but it does point to gross
inconsistencies in exchange rates that seem to correct over time. You can find
a detailed explanation of how the Big Mac index works and historical records
on its performance on the magazine’s Web site, www.economist.com/
markets/Bigmac/Index.cfm.
Of course, each market has its own culture and quirks. Some products simply
aren’t available in some places, and a staple in one place is a gourmet food in
another. Therefore, researchers took the analysis of the parity concept a step
further and looked at relative price levels between markets. This research led
to the next refinement in purchasing-power parity: that exchange rates move
by the expected difference in purchasing power, as measured by the differ-
ence in inflation between two countries.
Purchasing-power parity is one relationship that a macro hedge fund man-
ager thinks about when looking at two markets. If a manager has reason to
believe that price levels are going to change in a country, he knows that the
changes will affect wages and employment, how much consumers will buy,
and the price of the country’s export goods. And all these factors end up
affecting exchange rates.
For example, say an analysis of consumer-price indexes in Japan and Thailand
indicates that the yen is overvalued relative to the Thai baht. A macro hedge
fund manager takes advantage by short-selling yen and using the proceeds to
buy baht (see Chapter 11 for more on short-selling).
229
Chapter 13: Macro Funds: Looking for Global Trends

The International Fisher Effect
Irving Fisher, an economist who studied the role of interest rates in economies,
decided that because interest rates include levels of risk to an economy and a
component for inflation, traders don’t need to worry too much about what’s
causing changes in interest rates or price levels; they just need to make sure
that the difference in rates is properly taken into account. He deduced that the
difference in interest rates between two countries is the amount by which spot
exchange rates are expected to change (see the section “Trading currencies”
for more on spot rates).
The International Fisher Effect works like this. Say country A’s interest rates
fall from 5 percent to 4 percent. Country B’s interest rates remain at 8 per-
cent. Under the International Fisher effect, a 20-percent decline in country A’s
rates should cause country A’s currency to increase by 20 percent relative to
country B’s currency. If this doesn’t happen, a hedge fund manager could
take advantage by acquiring country A’s currency and shorting country B’s
(see Chapter 11).
Contemplating commodities
Commodities are the basic goods of life — natural resources and agricultural
products that feed people and animals, fuel vehicles, go into manufactured
items, and store value for future use. Some commodities are incredibly plenti-
ful, and others draw their value from their scarcity. Commodities are popular
with macro fund managers because their prices are set at the most basic
level of supply and demand in an economy. The fact that one bushel of wheat
is the same as another means that price fluctuations for commodities have
less extraneous noise than for stocks and bonds. An investor can buy oil to
get exposure to positive economic fundamentals in Nigeria without taking on
the unique and messy political risks of that nation, for example. What’s more,
derivatives on many commodities are readily available for trade, giving fund
managers more ways to structure profitable transactions (see Chapter 5 for
more on derivatives).
On the exchanges, currencies and interest-rate derivatives are classified as
commodity derivatives. In actual use, currencies and interest rates are consid-
ered to be in different categories.
Financing
Professionals who deal in commodities sometimes need financing to cover
the cash-flow gap between when they have to acquire raw material and when
they can sell the finished goods. Hedge funds are in the business of making
230
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

money rather than making goods, so this mismatch is a great opportunity. A
macro hedge fund can lend money to a business that needs to acquire com-
modities. Depending on the structure of the deal, the fund may be able to
make money on the commodity-price fluctuations and on the interest for the
use of the money.
For example, say that Refine Co. is an oil-refinery business that converts oil
into gasoline. It needs help buying the oil because prices keep going up. A
hedge fund swoops in and buys the oil and transfers it to Refine Co. When
Refine Co. sells gasoline to retail stations, it pays the hedge fund the current
spot price plus an interest factor. Refine Co. still makes money on its refining
services, and the hedge fund makes money on the financing — as long as oil
prices stay flat or go up.
231
Chapter 13: Macro Funds: Looking for Global Trends
Currency crises: Are hedge funds to blame?
Macro fund managers often take huge bets on
government policies and institutions. If a bet is
right, and if it involves profiting from bad news,
the hedge fund is left with big gains, and the gov-
ernment officials are left looking bad. What does
any good politician do in this situation? Place the
blame on someone else, of course! No hedge
fund manager has taken more blame for eco-
nomic events than George Soros. In 1997, he and
other hedge fund managers had reason to
believe that, given certain economic indicators,
the currencies of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia,
and the Philippines were overvalued relative to
the dollar and other world currencies. Therefore,
they shorted huge amounts of the currency (bor-
rowing the currency and selling it, hoping to
repay the loan when the borrowed currency
depreciated; see Chapter 11). The managers bor-
rowed so much money that there was no one left
to buy any of the currency. And when it became
clear that the currencies in question were,
indeed, overvalued and that everyone was short,
the currencies entered into a freefall, and the
hedge funds posted huge profits.
But while the fund managers toasted cham-
pagne, the people in these countries suffered.
Suddenly, goods were so cheap that it was hard
to make a living. These nations had been trying
to modernize, and the currency decline set back
the process. The resulting economic pain led to
political unrest.
The fact that George Soros funds a think-tank
called the Open Society Institute, which pro-
motes democracy and human rights around the
world, only compounded the conflict. His work
may seem like a good thing, unless of course
you happen to be a corrupt politician in an
authoritarian regime. Indonesian president
Suharto accused Soros of manipulating cur-
rency to destroy his political power. Suharto
was forced to resign in 1998. He may have had
a strong case against Soros if rumors of cor-
ruption and political mismanagement hadn’t
dogged him throughout his reign.

Speculating
Not all hedge fund managers have the patience to wait around to get paid, and
not all managers want to have business partners. But if a manager so much as
sniffs a profit opportunity, you can be sure that he’ll want a piece of the action.
To gain some profit without undue hassle, macro hedge funds speculate on the
value of commodities by buying at one price in the hopes of selling higher, but
they rarely want to take physical custody of the assets. Seriously, if you had an
expensive and tasteful office in Greenwich, Connecticut, would you want cattle
running around the courtyard and wheat stacked up in the lobby?
To avoid befriending a cow named Betsy and feeding her grains in the lobby, 
a hedge fund manager buys commodities through derivatives. He may buy
futures contracts to lock in exposure and sell futures to give up exposure. This
strategy gives the manager all the economic interest without the hassle of stor-
age. (If you want to find out more about derivatives, check out Chapter 5.)

alculating investment performance seems easy: You take your balance at
the end of the year, divide it by your balance at the start of the year, sub-
tract 1, and voila! For example, $1,100,000 ÷ $1,000,000 – 1 = 10 percent. But
what if you add to your investment in the middle of the year in order to net a
bigger return? What if your hedge fund manager had to cash out other share-
holders? Quickly, you’re left with algebra unlike any you’ve seen since high
school. Because of all the possible complications, many researchers in the
investment industry are trying to standardize calculations, and others are
asking pointed questions to make solid comparisons.
This chapter looks at how a hedge fund measures and evaluates its perfor-
mance, as well as what questions you need to ask your prospective fund part-
ners about performance calculation. Evaluating a hedge fund’s performance
helps you determine if the fund is the right fit for your investment objectives.
It also tells you if the hedge fund manager is doing well relative to the risk
taken, which is why you invest in the fund in the first place.

Measuring a Hedge Fund’s 
Risk and Return
Risk and return are measures of how a hedge fund performs. In general, less
risk is preferable to more, and more return is preferable to less. Some people
invest in hedge funds to reduce risk, preferring non-directional or absolute-
return funds (see Chapter 1); other investors aim to increase return regardless
of risk by investing in directional funds. These funds maintain exposure to the
market rate of return, and you have no guarantee that the direction of the
return will be up. (In Chapter 6, you find a big discussion of how risk and
return affect the assets that a hedge fund selects for its portfolio; the other
chapters of Part III cover different strategies that hedge funds can use to
manage risk and return.)
No type of hedge fund is better than another, as long as the fund that you
invest in suits your investment objectives. (You know what your objectives
are, don’t you? If not, head to Chapters 7, 8, and 9 for a crash course.)
The following sections give you the methods used to measure return and risk
within a hedge fund. I present the different forms of return and factor in fees,
and I explain how risk factors into performance.
Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds don’t have to publish their performance
numbers. And even if they do, they don’t have to follow a set methodology.
You have to ask questions about the numbers that you see.
Reviewing the return
Return is an estimate that investors can manipulate. The price of a security
tonight won’t be the price you’ll get if you sell in the morning, but it may be 
the best you get. Return is a measure of past performance, not a predictor of
future results. It doesn’t matter what a hedge fund did last year; this year is an
entirely different ballgame. Whether you’re a current or a prospective investor,
past return numbers are only rough indicators of what you can expect.
However, I can’t say that return figures are worthless. If you’re already in a
fund, return measures tell you how you did over a time period, which is
important information. You may get a different return when you cash out of
the fund, but the fund manager still posted a set of investment gains or losses
over a specific time period. You can compare that number to your expecta-
tions and your needs.
234
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

What muddies the picture is that a hedge fund manager may have been lucky
or unlucky, or he may have an investment style that does very well in some
market conditions and not so well in others. That’s why return is only one
piece in the evaluation of a portfolio’s performance.
Without further ado, the following list gives you the steps taken to calculate
investment return:
1. Valuing the assets. A hedge fund has to know what it holds and what its
holdings are worth. The best method is to use market value — what the
security would sell for on the market today — but some funds use their
initial costs instead (especially for assets, like real estate, that don’t
trade easily; see Chapter 5). Sometimes, a hedge fund will estimate the
value of an illiquid asset (see Chapter 4). The estimate may be close to
reality, or the fund may use it to make itself look good.
Many securities pay off some income. Certain bonds make regular inter-
est payments, and some stocks pay dividends. Funds should value secu-
rities that pay income with an accrual for any upcoming payments.
2. Choosing the dates. A year has 365 days (366 in leap year) and ends on
December 31. It has 12 months of 28, 29, 30, or 31 days. At least, that’s
how a year runs on a regular calendar. In an accounting calendar, years
may be a little different. A year may be 360 days long and have 12 months
of 30 days each. Each month could end on the last day on the calendar
(the 28th, 29th, 30th, or 31st), or a month may end on the last business
day or the last Friday.
It doesn’t matter how a hedge fund’s manager sets the fund’s time peri-
ods as long as she discloses the beginning and ending dates and applies
the method consistently. Just make sure when you’re doing comparisons
that you compare numbers for the same time periods. A shady fund
manager may change the ending date for a quarter in order to avoid a
big market decline on the last calendar day, for example (see Chapter 18
for more on due diligence).
3. Calculation methodology. Give someone with a numerical bent a list of
numbers and a calculator and she can come up with several different
relationships between numbers. After investors determine the asset
values for certain time periods, they can calculate rates of return. But
how? And over how long a time period? The process gets a little more
complicated at this stage. Even though the fund may hand over the work
to accountants or even actuaries, you should still understand the differ-
ences in the methods.
The following sections take you inside this third step by giving you different
calculation options. I also show you how fees enter the scene — about as
anticipated as a trip to the dentist (unless you’re the fund manager).
235
Chapter 14: But Will You Make Money? Evaluating Hedge-Fund Performance

Time-weighted returns
The most common way to calculate investment returns is to use a time-
weighted average — also called the Compound Average Growth Rate (CAGR).
For one time period, the calculation produces a simple percentage:
EOY stands for “end of year asset value,” and BOY is “beginning of year
value.” The result is the percentage return for one year. Simple arithmetic!
Now, if you want to look at your return over a period of several years, you
need to look at the compound return rather than the simple return for each
year, because the compound return shows you how your investment is grow-
ing. You’re getting returns on top of returns, which is a good thing, but the
math gets a little complicated because now you have to use the root function
on your calculator. The equation looks like this:
EOP stands for “end of the total time period,” BOP stands for “beginning of
the total time period,” and N is the number of years that you’re looking at.
Table 14-1 shows a time-weighted return over a four-year period.

Dollar-weighted returns
The dollar-weighted return — also called the internal rate of return (IRR) — is
the rate that makes the net present value of a stream of numbers equal to
zero. You find the number through an iteration that almost always has to be
done on a calculator or a computer. You use the IRR to determine the return
for a stream of numbers over time; it’s also widely used to value bonds.

Dollar-Weighted Return
I’m convinced that this method became popular in the 1970s, when Hewlett-
Packard introduced its HP12C financial calculator, the first of its kind that
could find internal rate of return easily. The calculator was also relatively
expensive when it came out, making it a big status symbol. Many financial
types started using internal rate of return so they could show off their fancy
calculators. Even today, IRR requires more computing power than most cal-
culators have because it’s the result of a series of calculations, not the solu-
tion to a single equation.
The calculation for IRR simply doesn’t work well for everything. The dollar-
weighted method can overstate returns, and it can occasionally show non-
sensical results if too many negative returns appear in a series. (As much as
investors don’t like it, a long-running hedge fund may have a year or two of
losses and still be a good investment.) 
Because of the problems with dollar-weighted returns, most people who ana-
lyze investment returns prefer to use a time-weighted, compound average
approach (see the previous section). It isn’t as flashy — you can do it with
the same cheap scientific calculator you used in high-school chemistry — 
but it gives you a more precise way to figure out how a fund performs over a
range of market cycles.
Gross of fees
One big nuance with return calculations is whether or not you include fees.
And fees can be hefty — a typical hedge fund charges a 1- or 2-percent man-
agement fee and takes a 20-percent cut of profits (see Chapter 2). Other funds
take much more. If the return the fund achieves is high enough, the fees may
237
Chapter 14: But Will You Make Money? Evaluating Hedge-Fund Performance

be worth it. On the other hand, you may be subsidizing the fund manager’s
art collection rather than getting the investment return that you’re expecting.
A gross-of-fees arrangement allows investors to evaluate a manager’s perfor-
mance so they can decide if it’s worth the fund manager’s price. If a fund
manager reports returns gross of fees, that means he hasn’t taken out most of
the fees. Trading costs should be removed because those commissions and
fees are necessary to building the portfolio. However, the manager shouldn’t
remove the investment management fees and cuts of profits. Trading costs
should be relatively small, but they can be high if the fund makes many small,
frequent trades or if it uses unusual strategies that carry high commissions.
Table 14-3 shows a gross-of-fees, time-weighted performance calculation,
where the trading costs barely amount to a rounding error.

One reason to report numbers gross of fees is that different investors may 
be paying different fees. A hedge fund may agree to reduce the profit fee
charged to a fund-of-funds (which invests in several different hedge funds;
see Chapter 15) or a single large investor in exchange for its investment. So,
although most investors may have an arrangement for a 2-percent management
fee and a 20-percent share of profits, some may be paying only “1 and 18.” 
Net of fees
In a net-of-fees performance calculation, you remove all the fees charged by
the fund. This method may not reflect the return that any one investor
receives, because different investors may have different fee schedules.
238
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Anyone evaluating a net-of-fee rate of return has to ask if different investors
pay different fees, because any one investor’s realized returns may be higher
or lower.

This table shows you how expenses will reduce your investment return. If the
hedge fund manager’s skills are adding value, then it’s worth the cost.
Sizing up the risk
An investor must consider return relative to what a manager had to do to 
get it, which is why you have to compare return to the amount of risk taken.
(Chapter 6 contains an in-depth analysis of risk, but I cover some of the
basics here as they relate to measurement.)
The problem is that measurements of risk are inherently subjective. What’s
risky to one investor may not be risky to you. For example, I have a weird
phobia about scuba diving, but I’m willing to sell stocks short. Plenty of
people have completely opposite views of the world, and that’s okay.
In finance, the dispute over how exactly to define risk has led to a range of
measures. I present what goes into each measurement in the following sec-
tions so that you can judge for yourself how appropriate each method is for
your needs.
239
Chapter 14: But Will You Make Money? Evaluating Hedge-Fund Performance

Standard deviation
In finance, risk is usually considered to be a function of standard deviation —
a statistic that shows how much your return may vary from the return that
you expect to get.
Say, for example, that you expect a security to have an average return of 10
percent over two years. If it returns 10 percent the first year and 10 percent
the second year, no deviation exists between any one return and the average
return. But if the security returns 20 percent one period and 0 percent the
next, it still returns an average of 10 percent but with big deviations from the
10-percent mean. The more a security swings around the expected return, the
riskier it is. (You can see all the math in Chapter 6.)
Some hedge funds are designed to have low standard deviations. Funds of
this structure are absolute-return funds, which aim to post returns within a
narrow range (often 6 to 8 percent). Directional funds, on the other hand, try
to maximize returns, so they sometimes take on very high levels of risk, cre-
ating a high expected standard deviation (see Chapter 6 for more). When
looking for a prospective fund, you can compare how much the return varies
from year to year to give you a ballpark idea of how risky it is.
In the Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory (MPT; see Chapter 6), standard
deviation is the basic measure of risk. It tells how likely you are to get any
return other than the average return. The more the return varies from year to
year, the more likely the fund is to be risky.
By the way, a fund with a high standard deviation can post mediocre returns,
and a fund with a low standard deviation can post stellar investment perfor-
mance. Most situations are entirely possible. That’s the risk you take for
investing in a hedge fund!
Beta
A refinement of the standard deviation measurement is beta, which compares
the standard deviation of an investable asset or fund to the standard deviation
of the market itself. (See Chapter 6 for more information and the entire math.)
In most cases, the performance of an index measures the “market” (in the
sense that the index is a sample of investable assets, not an agglomeration of
all the possible assets that you can invest in), like the S&P 500 in the United
States or the Nikkei in Japan. 
If a fund has a beta of 1, it should move right in step with the market itself. If
it has a beta greater than 1, it should move more sharply up or more sharply
down — whichever way the market goes. If it has a beta of less than 1, it
should move in the same direction as the market, but less sharply. If the beta
is negative, it should move in the opposite direction of the market.
240
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Peak-to-trough ranges
A simple way to look at the volatility of a long-standing hedge fund is to com-
pare the distance between the peak — the year with the highest return —
and the trough — the year with the lowest return. The greater the distance
between the peak and the trough, and the closer together the two are, the
riskier the fund is. For example, if a fund’s peak return was 80 percent, fol-
lowed by a loss of 35 percent the next year, the peak-to-trough distance is 
115 percent (80 – (–35)) over two years. If another fund had a peak return 
of 15 percent, followed by a return of 10 percent the next year, its peak-to-
trough distance is 5 percent (15 – 10) over two years. The first fund is much
riskier than the second fund.
For a hedge fund with a short operating history, you can look at the peak and
trough months rather than years.
Stress tests
Standard deviation and beta (see the previous two sections) are nice short-
cuts, but they don’t answer one question that may be on a worrisome
investor’s mind: How much money will I lose if things go terribly wrong? A
stress test solves this problem. The test is a computer simulation that models
what could happen to a hedge fund’s portfolio under a variety of different
scenarios, like a dramatic increase in interest rates, the Euro falling apart, or
the government of Mexico defaulting on its bonds. Based on the sensitivity
that the different fund investments have to the tested factors, the stress test
shows how much the factors may affect the portfolio’s return. The less effect
the events have, the less risky the fund — assuming that the right stresses
have been tested. 
Stress tests are expensive to run, and even the best are based on guesses
about the future. They are mostly performed by actuaries working with
investment consultants (see Chapter 17). Investors often feel the effects of
economic changes that seem to come out of nowhere. Still, the information
from a test can be useful — especially for a fund that intends to retain expo-
sure to a certain set of market factors. For example, a macro hedge fund that
concentrates on emerging Asian-Pacific markets could undergo a test for
exposure to those currencies and interest rates (see Chapter 13 for more on
macro funds).
Mathematically, a difference exists between risk and uncertainty. Risk is 
the possibility of an event happening that you can describe and quantify.
Someone can study a situation and set odds on the likelihood of it happening.
After you describe and measure risk, it becomes possible to set insurance or
a hedge against it. Uncertainty is an event that may happen, but you have no
way to quantify it. The possibility of a hurricane destroying the downtown
241
Chapter 14: But Will You Make Money? Evaluating Hedge-Fund Performance

section of a major city is an example of risk. The possibility of aliens landing
on Earth and taking control is an example of uncertainty. The latter could
happen, but can you set a probability and limit on it?
Value at risk
Value at risk (VAR) is a single number that represents how much you can
expect a portfolio to lose over a given time period. The value is a statistical
calculation involving several equations, so it is very difficult to calculate by
hand. You see it quoted with similar margins of error that you see with politi-
cal polls.
For example, a hedge fund may say that it has a 95 percent confidence level
that its portfolio has a 10-day VAR of losing $10 million. This translates to the
following: Based on the securities held in the portfolio and on market condi-
tions, the fund manager is 95 percent certain that the most the fund could
lose over the next 10 days is $10 million. Events could take place over the
next ten days that fall into the 5 percent uncertainty level, but more likely
than not, the most the fund will lose is $10 million.
In most cases, you will have to rely on the hedge fund for VAR information.
The number can change with the fund’s holdings and overall market condi-
tions, so it can change over time.
Benchmarks for Evaluating 
a Fund’s Risk and Return
Investment performance is relative — relative to your needs and expecta-
tions and relative to what your return would’ve been had you invested your
money elsewhere. That’s why you have to compare your return and risk num-
bers to something. But what? In many cases, hedge-fund investors compare
performance to a market index. Some compare performance to that of similar
hedge funds or to an expected return based on the fund’s style. All these
types of comparisons have their advantages and disadvantages, which I go
into here in this section.
An old doctor’s joke focuses on an operation that was a success even though
the patient died. The same basic concept can be true with investment perfor-
mance. A fund can beat its benchmarks and all its peers and still lose money.
The fund manager may be happy; the consultants and brokers who recom-
mended the hedge fund may be happy; but the investors who put money into
the fund may be fuming.
242
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Looking into indexes
The most common way to compare investment performance is with a market
index. Market indexes are the measures of the overall market that you hear
quoted all the time in the news, like the Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Not only are these widely reviewed, but also
widely mimicked: Many mutual funds and futures contracts are designed to
mimic the performance of market indexes. What this means is that investors
can always do at least as well as the index itself if their investment objectives
call for exposure to that part of the broad investment market.
Indexes aren’t perfect for comparison purposes. One big problem is that
investors often look at the wrong indexes for the type of investments that
they have. For example, an investor may compare the performance of a
macro fund that invests all over the world to the S&P 500 when he or she
should use a global index that includes a range of securities (see Chapter 13
for more on macro funds).
In many cases, you should compare a fund to a mixture of indexes. For exam-
ple, you should compare a macro fund that invests
30 percent in international equities
30 percent in international bonds
40 percent in currencies
to
30 percent of the return on an international equity index
30 percent of the return on an international bond index
40 percent to a currency index
Preparing indexes is a big business. In many cases, indexes are designed and
calculated by newspapers that want to keep their names in front of investors,
so the different companies that calculate and maintain indexes put different
conditions on their use. Anyone offering an S&P 500 index fund has to pay a
fee to Standard & Poor’s. Hedge funds and performance-consulting firms may
have to pay index companies for detailed information about the securities in
the indexes. When a hedge fund presents its results relative to a given index
to you, a prospective investor, it may do so for different reasons:
 Because that index is the best choice
 Because the index’s performance makes the fund look good
 Because another index service was too expensive for it to use
243
Chapter 14: But Will You Make Money? Evaluating Hedge-Fund Performance

A hedge fund should use the same benchmarks every time it reports. If it
changes its benchmarks, that may mean that the fund is trying to make its
performance look good or is changing its investment style so that it no longer
matches the profile of the fund you need in your portfolio. 
Different indexes show different results, even if they are calculated using the
same securities. There are several different ways to calculate indexes, and
understanding them can give you a sense of why a fund manager might
choose one over the other.
Market-capitalization-weighted index
Market capitalization is the total value of a security. For example, the market
capitalization of a common stock is the total number of shares outstanding
multiplied by the price per share, and the market capitalization of a bond
issue is the number of bonds issued multiplied by the price of each bond. In 
a market-capitalization-weighted index, different securities are entered in pro-
portion to their total market value. One example of a market-capitalization-
weighted index is the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500).
A market-capitalization-weighted index is a good representation of how the
market as a whole trades, but it may place too much emphasis on the price
fluctuations of the largest companies. The NASDAQ Composite Index, which
represents the value of all the companies traded on NASDAQ, is dispropor-
tionately exposed to the trading of Microsoft and other huge high-tech and
biotech companies. Those huge technology companies are mainstays on
NASDAQ, but most of the companies on that exchange are quite small.
Price-weighted index
A price-weighted index includes one of each security from the group being
measured. For example, a price-weighted stock index includes one share of
each of the companies it tracks, and a price-weighted bond index includes
one share of each of the bonds it tracks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is
an example of a price-weighted index.
The price-weighted index is independent of the total capitalization of the
included securities, so securities with a high price may be overweighted.
Differing results for different indexes
Even if they include the same securities, price-weighted and market-
capitalization indexes can post different results. Table 14-5 shows how 
this can happen.

Picking over peer rankings
If you just want the risk and return that comes with an index, you wouldn’t be
considering paying a hedge fund’s high fees. And if you’ve made the decision
that a hedge fund is the appropriate way to go with your money, you’ll want
to know how your fund does against other hedge funds that you could’ve
invested in instead.
That’s why you look at peer group rankings. Many hedge funds report their
results to services, like Morningstar (www.morningstar.com), where the
analysts rank funds based on their risk-and-return parameters (see the sec-
tion “Hiring a Reporting Service to Track Hedge-Fund Performance”). For
example, the service ranks arbitrage funds against other arbitrage funds, and
long-short funds against other long-short funds. With the information from
the services, you can see if your fund is one of the better or worse ones
within a specific style. Unlike Morningstar’s mutual fund information, you
have to pay to see these rankings.
245
Chapter 14: But Will You Make Money? Evaluating Hedge-Fund Performance

One problem with peer rankings of hedge funds is that reporting is optional,
which makes the picture you see less rounded. A fund that doesn’t do so well
is less likely to report its numbers for a ranking, so the average performance
may have an upward bias. A fund in the bottom half of a published ranking
isn’t in the bottom half of all hedge funds within that style; it’s just in the
bottom half of funds that reported. You can bet that plenty of funds in that
style are worse; they’re just in hiding.
Standardizing performance calculation:
Global Investment Performance Standards
As you read through this chapter, you may be surprised at just how arbitrary
some of the performance information is. Hedge fund managers have many
options to use when calculating and comparing risk and return, and they have
an incentive to choose the methods that make them look better than the alter-
natives. In 1996, the Association for Investment Management and Research,
now known as the CFA Institute (www.cfainstitute.org), introduced its
Performance Presentation Standards to help U.S. investment advisors present
their numbers fairly and to make it easy for investors to compare the perfor-
mance of different firms. In 2006, the CFA Institute adopted a revised standard,
the Global Investment Performance Standards (or GIPS) that applies to money
managers around the world.
Compliance with the standards is voluntary, but it allows fund managers to
market their results to current and prospective investors as being “GIPS
Compliant” or “GIPS Verified.”
The Global Investment Performance Standards include the following:
 Accurate data collection, with records to support the information
 Market-value accounting
 Accrual accounting for the value of any assets that generate income
 Monthly portfolio valuation, ending on the last business day or last cal-
endar day of the month
 Time-weighted returns
 Results that are net of investment expenses
 Results shown for the last five years (or from the fund’s inception if it’s
less than five years old), with annual results given for each year
246
Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Some hedge funds ignore GIPS, and sometimes for good reasons:
 It can be expensive to calculate results in the correct manner in order to
qualify for the GIPS label.
 The CFA Institute designed the methodology for investment-management
firms that handle several different portfolios in-house, but many hedge
funds are one-portfolio operations.
 Not all investors are aware of GIPS or even care, something that the CFA
Institute hopes to change.
Putting Risk and Return into Context
with Academic Measures
It isn’t enough to have the return and risk numbers and comparisons with
indexes or other funds (of course!). You have to put the performance figures
into context to figure out what the portfolio manager did to get those numbers.
Given that hedge funds have huge minimum-investment requirements (see
Chapters 1 and 2), investors have a lot of money at stake. Many hedge-fund
investors, like employees of pension funds or charitable endowments, have
responsibilities to the people who rely on their funds. These factors are the
reasons why investors need to know what the risk-and-return numbers mean
and how they reflect on hedge fund managers’ performances. Several equa-
tions developed in ivory towers can help you figure out why a hedge fund did
as well as it did, and this section shows you what they are.
Academic approaches to finance have their problems because they’re based
on the assumption that rational investors are trading in efficient markets (see
Chapter 6 for more on this topic). You may be tempted to laugh off the whole
idea of academic theories, but that leaves you with nothing to determine how
a hedge fund performed. Look at the approaches in this section with the limi-
tations in mind If you’re taking an MBA-level investments course, these
approaches will show up on the midterm — it doesn’t matter if I’m teaching
or not!
Sharpe measure
William Sharpe is another of the many Nobel-Prize winners that figure into
the hedge-fund world. (You may remember him from such equations as the
Capital Assets Pricing Model, described in Chapter 6.) His equation, the
247
Chapter 14: But Will You Make Money? Evaluating Hedge-Fund Performance

Sharpe measure, is the amount of performance that a fund earns over and
above the risk-free rate of return (which, for investors based in the United
States, is the interest rate on Treasury bills) divided by the standard devia-
tion of returns. (Standard deviation is a mathematical measure of how much
one number in a set varies from the average of all the numbers in the set.)
You’re dying to see the equation, right? Here’s what it looks like:
In English, the Sharpe measure shows whether the portfolio’s return for
taking risk (the return minus the risk-free rate) came by increasing the
amount of risk in the portfolio or from the fund manager’s skill (known as
alpha; see Chapter 6), which allowed her to get a better return than expected
from the amount of standard deviation in the securities held by the portfolio.
A higher number is better than a lower one, because a higher number indi-
cates that the hedge fund manager is getting more return for the risk that
she’s taking.
For example, if the fund returned 15 percent, the risk-free rate was 5 percent,
and the fund’s standard deviation was 20 percent, the Sharpe measure would
be (15 – 5)/20, or 50 percent. This would be better than a fund with a Sharpe
measure of 40 percent, and worse than a fund with a Sharpe measure of 75
percent.
Treynor measure
Jack Treynor developed a refinement of the Sharpe measure (see the previ-
ous section) that looks at how a hedge fund performed for the risk it took
over and above the risk of the market as a whole — not just at how it per-
formed relative to the risk-free rate of return.
The equation is 
σp
After all, people take risk when they invest, but they can put their money into
a low-fee index fund (a fund invested in the same securities as a broad-market
index, like the S&P 500, with the goal of generating the same return) instead
of paying a hedge fund manager fees for 2 percent of the assets and 20 per-
cent of the profits.

Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

For example, if the fund returned 15 percent, the market rate of return was 10
percent, and the fund’s standard deviation was 20 percent, the Treynor mea-
sure would be (15 – 10)/20, or 25 percent. This is better than a fund with a
Treynor measure of 15 percent, and worse than a fund with a Treynor mea-
sure of 35 percent.
Jensen’s alpha
Michael Jensen, a professor at the Harvard School of Business, decided 
that investors should just use the Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM; see
Chapter 6) rather than Sharpe’s or Treynor’s measures of performance. The
CAPM involves alpha. Hedge fund managers love to talk about alpha. The
word derives from the CAPM; it measures how much an investment returns
over and above its beta (its exposure to the market).
Here’s the equation (with A representing alpha):
E(r) = B(rm – rf) + A+ rf
If a portfolio has a positive alpha, the portfolio manager did a good job. If 
the portfolio’s alpha is zero or negative, maybe the manager’s fees weren’t
deserved.
The appraisal ratio
Some performance analysts use a fourth measure to evaluate a hedge fund’s
performance: the appraisal ratio, which divides the fund’s alpha by the non-
systematic risk of the portfolio. Although the equation is simple, you more or
less need a computer to generate the statistics involved in this calculation.
The non-systematic risk is risk that the manager could’ve diversified by adding
more securities to the portfolio but didn’t. The return from the risk isn’t so
much due to the portfolio manager’s skill as to the portfolio manager’s deci-
sion not to diversify the portfolio.
Suppose, for example, that a hedge fund manager decides to invest only in
oil-company stock. Beta isn’t the best comparison (see Chapter 6), because
the fund’s portfolio is far narrower than the entire investment market. Some
of that risk is unnecessary, and the manager could remove it through diversi-
fication. The appraisal ratio is an attempt to separate the diversifiable risk
from the true alpha — the true extra performance due to a portfolio man-
ager’s skill.
249
Chapter 14: But Will You Make Money? Evaluating Hedge-Fund Performance

Many experts who study the market say that alpha doesn’t exist; that the
hedge fund manager has made a decision to take extra risk. After that risk is
correctly described, alpha may disappear.
Serving Yourself with a Reality 
Check on Hedge-Fund Returns
One reason that so many investors are interested in hedge funds is because
they think hedge funds are raking in enormous investment returns that other
investors can’t get. Certainly, some hedge funds bring in enormous invest-
ment returns, and the nature of a hedge fund’s structure supports the idea
that other investors are shut out (see Chapter 2 for info on the structure of
hedge funds). But the reality is that many hedge funds don’t perform in the
stratosphere, which is why you need to know what you want from your
investments before you commit. The following sections aim to put you in
touch with your investment needs by bringing to light many facts about
hedge-fund returns.
The Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index, a leading measure of hedge-
fund performance, reported that the average hedge-fund return (at least,
among those funds that submitted return data) was 7.61 percent for 2005.
The NASDAQ Composite Index returned only 1.37 percent for the same
period, but the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index was up
10.02 percent. 
Risk and return tradeoff
Some hedge funds post poor results relative to a stock-market index because
they’re designed to perform very differently. Investment return is a function
of risk; the more risk a fund takes, the greater its expected return. A hedge
fund’s goal is to post a return that’s greater than expected for a given level of
risk. Some funds choose high risk levels in the hopes of even higher returns,
and others maintain very low risk levels and generate relatively low returns.
Many investors are content with an 8 percent return year in and year out, but
others would find this incredibly disappointing. Before you commit to a
hedge fund, you need to know your investment objectives inside and out.
(Chapter 6 gives you the lowdown on many risk and return topics.)

Part III: Setting Up Your Hedge Fund Investment Strategy 

Survivor bias
Many hedge fund managers limit how often investors can make withdrawals,
but they can’t lock up an investor’s money forever. A fund may require that
an investor keep money in for two years, but if performance is bad in both
years, you can bet that the investor will yank the money as soon as the time
period expires.
In addition, hedge fund managers charge high fees, but they can collect a
profit payout only if the funds show a profit (see Chapter 2 for more). If a
fund isn’t doing so well, its investors will go, and the fund manager will want
out, too, so they can make some money elsewhere. Hedge Fund Research, a
firm that tracks hedge funds, estimated that 11.4 percent of hedge funds
folded in 2005.
When looking at long-term results for hedge funds, remember that the worst
performing funds all probably dropped out of the game after two years,
which means funds that are still in business have less competition. They
already have better-than-average status because they’re still in business.
However, unless they’re looking for new investors, they’ll force you to invest
in a newly formed fund. Will it be a survivor or one of the ones that eventu-
ally shut down? 
Performance persistence
One huge problem for any hedge fund and its investors is following one good
year with another. Is a great number the result of luck, or is it due to the port-
folio manager’s skill? Will the manager’s luck hold out next year? Will a skilled
portfolio manager face bad luck next year? It’s really hard to post good per-
formance year after year — a problem known as performance persistence.
A study published in 2000 by Vikas Agarwal of Georgia State University and
Narayan Naik of the London Business School found no evidence of persis-
tence in the funds that they studied. One year’s performance wasn’t an indi-
cator of the next year’s, and the relationship between performance one year
and the next weakened as more time periods were included in the study.
What does this mean? If a hedge fund has the kind of extraordinary return
that grabs headlines this year, it probably won’t bring in those spectacular
returns the next year. This is a phenomenon known as reversion to the mean.
251
Chapter 14: But Will You Make Money? Evaluating Hedge-Fund Performance

Style persistence
The problem of a fund manager changing style to get performance is called
style persistence. If a fund keeps changing its investment strategy, it may post
good numbers, but consultants, academics, and others who evaluate returns
may not know what to do with the fund.
Academic performance studies in particular control for different risk mea-
sures, which affects the performance persistence that they report (see the
previous section). Some funds show persistence, but that’s because the fund
changes its investment style with the market. Some investors may want a
hedge fund that’s flexible and can post a consistent return no matter what.
Other investors may need a fund to limit its investments or maintain a consis-
tent risk profile so that it complements other parts of their portfolios.
Hiring a Reporting Service to Track
Hedge-Fund Performance
Given all the information-collecting options I’ve covered in the pages of this
chapter, how in the world are you supposed to keep track of everything to
find out how a hedge fund actually performs? Some people require help in
this area, and help is available. Along with the numbers that the fund man-
ager presents, you can find several consulting firms and reporting services
that monitor how hedge funds perform, analyze their results, and evaluate
their risk and return based on the styles that the fund managers follow. The
following list is by no means exhaustive and doesn’t represent an endorse-
ment. My only goal is to give you some ideas of where to start if you want to
enlist some help to evaluate hedge-fund performance.
Most of these companies charge for their services — and charge a lot.
Greenwich-Van
Greenwich-Van (www.vanhedge.com) is one of many hedge-funds services
that operates in two businesses:
 A consulting firm that advises investors on hedge-fund investments
 A hedge fund performance-analysis service

Some information on the performance of broad categories of hedge funds is
available for free from the Web site, but other information is available only to
institutional investors (pensions, endowments, and foundations) that pay the
firm for its services.
HedgeFund.net
HedgeFund.net maintains a database of quantitative and qualitative informa-
tion about hedge funds, submitted by the funds themselves. The site also car-
ries news and information about the industry (even offering a free daily report)
and offers both free and paid services; however, all subscribers must be
accredited investors (see Chapter 2 for more on this topic).
Hedge Fund Research
Hedge Fund Research (www.hedgefundresearch.com) compiles detailed
databases of hedge fund performance and administration. It has at least some
information on 9,000 funds and detailed information on 5,800 of them. This
helps people determine how many funds are being formed, how many are
being disbanded, and what kind of returns are being generated for investors.
Full access is available to accredited investors for a fee.
Lipper Hedge World
Lipper (www.lipperhedgeworld.com) made its name in mutual-fund per-
formance reporting, and it now offers hedge-fund performance services as
well. The company, owned by Reuters, offers a variety of free and paid
reports on performance. How much access you get depends on whether
you’re accredited (see Chapter 2) and how much you’re willing to pay.
Managed Account Report
Managed Account Report (www.marhedge.com) collects news and informa-
tion on the hedge-fund industry, organizes conferences, and reports on
hedge-fund performance. The firm collects its data from fund managers and
reports it to subscribers on its Web site and print publication. It compares
results to indexes of hedge-fund performance prepared by the Barclay Group
(www.barclaygrp.com). Subscribers don’t have to be accredited investors.

Morningstar
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) is a dominant firm for mutual-fund
performance analysis, and it’s building a niche in hedge funds. Funds report
their own performance numbers each month. The database was started in
January 2004 and currently holds information on 3,000 hedge funds, funds of
hedge funds, and commodity trading advisors. Subscribers, who must be
accredited investors (see Chapter 2), can access the site’s information to get
a sense of how a fund’s risk and return compares to other hedge funds follow-
ing the same investment style.

A
fter reading up on hedge funds to this point and set-
tling on your investment objectives, you may find
that a traditional hedge fund just isn’t for you. However,
that doesn’t mean hedge funds aren’t useful to you any-
more. You can hook onto different types of hedge funds,
or you can use hedge-fund strategies for other types of
investments. Find out how in Part IV.
Whether you’re dead set on entering a hedge fund or not,
you need to do your due diligence on a fund before you
invest, because a hedge-fund investment often involves
large amounts of hard-earned money. Chapter 18 shows
you the way.
Hedge funds are private partnerships, however, so you’ll
have a difficult time finding out much information about a
fund before you invest — but the task isn’t impossible.
Many investors find it worthwhile to hire consultants or
other advisors to help them investigate funds and their
appropriateness for the investors’ needs. Chapter 17 
gives you some advice on how to do that.

O
ne problem with fund strategies is that they’re sometimes too special-
ized for a hedge fund investor. Even an accredited investor — one with
a net worth of $1 million or an annual income of at least $200,000 ($300,000
with a spouse; see Chapter 2) — may not have the resources to take advan-
tage of a diversified range of hedge-fund strategies. Likewise, some hedge
fund managers don’t like to limit themselves to a single investment strategy
when one strategy is temporarily out of market fashion. Other hedge fund
managers like to diversify their market approaches so that they can have
even performance no matter how the market is doing.
In this chapter, I introduce several types of hedge funds that cover a range of
investment strategies. I examine the aptly named multi-strategy fund, and I
present the world of fund-of-funds investing; I also look at some niche hedge
funds and related investments to show you what your options are. If you’re
interested in hedge funds that invest in a range of investment styles, you can
use the options I present in this chapter to discover more about them.
Multi-Strategy Funds: Pursuing a 
Range of Investment Strategies
The problem with any investment strategy is that it will work better in some
years than in others. It can be really hard to sit through a down year, no
matter how much the manager believes in the strategy. A lot of smart people

identified the dot-com bubble and predicted its collapse, but most of them
were way too early in their predictions. They lost investors who thought they
were out of touch — wasn’t it obvious that Webvan and Pets.com were the
waves of the future?
To circumvent the bad years, some managers want the right to change their
strategies. Others, especially those with very large funds, handle several
investment strategies in-house, with different staff members getting different
amounts of money to manage based on market conditions. Multi-strategy funds
are hedge funds that pursue several different investment strategies instead of
focusing on any one investment style. In the following sections, you find out
more about multi-strategy funds.
The advantage of a multi-strategy fund is that a variety of different invest-
ment styles all mesh under one roof. The hedge fund investor has more diver-
sification benefits and more consistent performance than with hedge funds
that are organized to follow a single investment strategy.
A multi-strategy focus may be just an excuse for posting mediocre perfor-
mances year in and year out. The best hedge fund managers tend to be disci-
plined, even when the markets are turned against them; they know that
buying low is the best assurance of some day selling high. Other hedge fund
managers drift from strategy to strategy, hoping that something will stick for
this year, instead of generating value for investors. If a fund you’re interested
in pursues multiple strategies, find out how the manager determines those
strategies and how the fund moves money among them (see Chapter 18 for
more on due diligence). A multi-strategy fund is still a hedge fund, so buying
into it calls for the same research as any other hedge fund.
Determining the strategies
A multi-strategy hedge fund is usually set up in one of two ways. First, you
have the top-down strategy:
1. The hedge fund manager starts with a top-down analysis of market con-
ditions and expectations. (For an in-depth discussion of top-down analy-
sis, see Chapter 5.)
2. The manager works out what sectors and strategies are likely to do well.
3. The manager uses the sector and strategy information to guide the
fund’s allocation of money.
This may well be a messy process, with plenty of smart people arguing over
what these investment traders, analysts, and portfolio managers see ahead in
the markets. The goal of the process for the traders, analysts, and portfolio
managers involved isn’t to get a consensus; the goal is to be right about the
258
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

direction of the market, or at least make enough of a case to get an allocation
of capital to invest. The advantage is that members of the hedge fund’s staff
have to think through their arguments in order to get them past everyone
else, so the best ideas survive. As a result, multi-strategy funds may have
some internal tensions and employee turnover. These factors don’t necessar-
ily make for a bad fund, although internal turmoil can be disconcerting to
hedge fund investors.
The second setup involves the diverse strategies. At many multi-strategy
funds, the hedge fund manager hires sub-managers who concentrate on 
specific market sectors, derivates, arbitrage, or other trading strategies (see
Part III for discussions of these strategies). Each sub-manager starts with a
set amount of money to manage. If a sub-manager does well, she’ll receive
more money. If she doesn’t do well, she may see her money cut — or she may
lose her job. This setup can be a great way to ensure that sub-managers who
can make money get to make a lot of it for the fund. However, markets run in
cycles. If the hedge fund manager isn’t careful, he may give a sub-manager
too large a percentage of the fund just as the sub-manager’s investing style
falls out of favor, while he asks other sub-managers to give up money just as
their investment styles come back in fashion.
Dividing in-house responsibilities
After the hedge fund manager(s) determines the allocation of the money (see
the previous section), he or she gives the money to different people in the
firm to manage. In essence, a multi-strategy hedge fund is a group of little
hedge funds clustered under one roof. Two traders may handle the currency;
two analysts may work on emerging market equities; three analysts may spe-
cialize in risk arbitrage (see Chapter 10); and one analyst may do nothing but
highly leveraged fixed income trading (see Chapter 11 for more on leverage).
The goal of all involved is to post as great a return as possible, given the
amount of money allocated. (You can find out more about the different jobs
of hedge fund staff members in Chapter 1.)
Managers usually assign risk-management responsibilities to those who
determine the investment strategies. Someone at the top needs to make sure
that the strategies mesh and that the fund takes on only as much risk as its
investors want and its prime broker is prepared to accept. If a fund has too
much risk, it may not be able to borrow money for leverage strategies,
borrow securities for short-selling, or even get its trades executed (see
Chapter 11 for more information).
What does this mean for you? In a situation where a fund has too much risk,
it may take money away from a trader who’s doing well because his or her
success may be increasing the fund’s exposure to one specific strategy.
259
Chapter 15: Hooking Onto Other Types of Hedge Funds

Scoping the pitfalls of working 
with a broad portfolio
A multi-strategy fund is often a very large hedge fund — one with a few billion
dollars under management; after all, it’s expensive to do the research and have
the staff members execute a variety of strategies well. A small hedge fund
would have a hard time justifying the costs of managing different investment
styles under one roof. Some trading strategies utilized by a multi-strategy fund
require large commitments of the firm’s capital as collateral, which alone may
limit the number of strategies that a small hedge fund can try.
Multi-strategy funds face another interesting problem: keeping top employees
happy. All hedge funds — actually, all employers — have this problem, but a
multi-strategy fund has some unique issues. If the fund as a whole doesn’t do
well one year, for instance, it may not be able to collect the performance fee
(see Chapter 2). No performance fee means the fund may not have money to
pay bonuses, even to employees who had great performances in their parts
of the portfolio. And, with so many people in the firm, it may be tough for
anyone to be a star.
People in the investment business make a lot of money, but that doesn’t
mean they don’t want more! In 2005, the CFA Institute — the trade organiza-
tion for investment analysts and money managers — reported that the
median compensation for members working at hedge funds was $250,000.
So, what happens to the disgruntled fund workers? An analyst with a good
track record for her part of the fund will quit, possibly starting her own
hedge fund that focuses only on her chosen investment technique. The multi-
strategy fund then has to replace her, with the fund’s performance suffering
during the transition.
Funds of Funds: Investing in 
a Variety of Hedge Funds
An alternative to traditional hedge funds is a fund of funds, which is an invest-
ment that pools money from several different investors — who may be indi-
viduals or institutions like pensions, foundations, or endowments — and puts
it into a handful of different hedge funds.
260
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

A fund of funds is usually set up as an investment pool registered with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC; see Chapter 3 for more infor-
mation on registration), although it doesn’t necessarily have to be registered.
The process for buying into most funds of funds is the same as for other
hedge funds (see Chapter 4).
A registered hedge fund, including a registered fund of funds, may offer the
people or institutions that invest more protections if the fund turns out to be
mismanaged or a fraud, but registration is no assurance that the hedge fund
or fund of funds is a good one.
Funds of funds have unique characteristics you need to consider. Not only do
you have to decide if a hedge fund is the right investment for you (see the
chapters of Part II) and what kinds of hedge funds are the right investments
for you (see the chapters of Part III), but also whether a fund of funds is the
right way for you to buy into a hedge fund.
In the following sections, we outline different types of funds of funds, list the
advantages and disadvantages of funds of funds, and enter the realm of funds
of funds of funds (not a typo!).
Surveying fund of funds types
Hedge funds themselves fall into many different categories. Some funds
invest in growth equities, almost the same way that a mutual fund might.
Others do some very fancy risk arbitrage transactions involving emerging
country debt. (The chapters of Part III describe the different strategies that
funds follow.) When it comes to funds of funds, some are diversified across
many investment styles, and others are designed to capture the best hedge
funds working in a specific investment style.
But, although funds of funds may follow different strategies, they fall into
only two distinct types: multi-manager and multi-strategy.
Multi-strategy funds of funds
Like a multi-strategy hedge fund (see the first section of this chapter), a
multi-strategy fund of funds pursues different investment strategies to
achieve the goal of increased return for a given level of risk. The fund of
funds manager chooses funds that complement each other and that usually
have a directional market return (in other words, they have some market
risk, unlike a traditional hedge fund, which is designed to remove market
exposure; see Chapter 6). The goal is to give investors diversified exposure 
to an array of hedge funds in order to generate a steady annual return.
261
Chapter 15: Hooking Onto Other Types of Hedge Funds

Multi-manager funds of funds
A multi-manager fund of funds puts its money into several hedge funds that
follow a similar strategy. The manager may look for absolute-return funds,
which are hedge funds that follow a traditional strategy with no market expo-
sure (see Chapter 1), or he may concentrate on a single aggressive strategy.
Investing in several funds within the same strategy eliminates the manager
risk, which is the value that the manager adds or subtracts (also called alpha;
see Chapter 6). After all, in any strategy and in any year, some people do a lot
better than others. The goal of the multi-manager fund is to combine the
expertise of many different money managers following the same strategy in
order to get a more consistent return for investors than they may get by
investing in just one fund.
Highlighting the advantages 
of funds of funds
Funds of funds have some neat benefits for investors, hedge fund managers,
and the banks, brokers, and consultants who put hedge funds together.
First off, no matter who’s investing, funds of funds have two distinct advan-
tages you can take to the bank:
 Relatively low minimum investment. A fund of funds doesn’t have to
limit itself to accredited investors, or people with a net worth of more
than $1 million or an annual income of at least $200,000 ($300,000 with a
spouse; see Chapter 2). (Some funds of funds may set net-worth require-
ments anyway in order to help comply with suitability rules.) Funds of
funds are designed to have relatively low minimum investments. Many
traditional hedge fund managers, by contrast, would rather have a few
large investors than many small ones, so they may set minimum invest-
ments out of the range of even the most accredited investors. Instead of
having to come up with $250,000 or more to put into a hedge fund, a
fund of funds may call for you to buy in for $25,000 or less.
Just because you can afford an investment doesn’t mean that the invest-
ment is right for you. The National Association of Securities Dealers
requires member firms to determine if investments are suitable for their
clients before they sign on the dotted line. Chapters 7 and 8 cover some of
the features of hedge funds that may affect your investment objectives.
 Easy diversification. The high minimum investments for many hedge
funds prevent even people who can afford to buy into them from diversi-
fying among investment strategies. Diversification is one of the easiest
ways to reduce risk in an investment portfolio (you can see the math in
262
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

Chapter 6). With a fund of funds, the pooled money goes into different
hedge funds, which may lead to a broader range of holdings that increase
returns and reduce risk.
 Better due diligence. The manager of a fund of funds has resources to
run background checks on hedge fund managers, and he may uncover
potential problems or conflicts of interest. See Chapter 18 for more infor-
mation on due diligence.
Beyond those distinct and attractive advantages, the following considera-
tions are unique to people involved in a fund of funds:
 For the hedge fund manager: One challenge for many hedge fund man-
agers is attracting enough money to get the funds going. Hedge fund
investment strategies often require big commitments of capital, and the
high expenses are better covered over large asset bases. At the same
time, few hedge funds are set up to deal with many investors, and unreg-
istered hedge funds simply can’t have many people (see Chapter 3). The
fund of funds counts as a single investor, so it’s a great way for a hedge
fund to get plenty of money without running against regulatory limits on
the number of investors that the fund may have.
 For the fund of funds organizer: The bank, broker, or consultant who
organizes a fund of funds has one big incentive — the big fees involved.
But what’s good for the fund of funds organizer isn’t necessarily good for
you! This can be an expensive way to invest in hedge funds.
Acknowledging the problems 
with funds of funds
Although a fund of funds may make it easier for you to enter a hedge fund, it
can’t solve some of the problems inherent in the hedge fund structure —
problems that make them unappealing to many investors:
 Limited redemption rights. A fund of funds investor has few redemption
rights, so you may not be able to get your money out when you need it.
Many traditional hedge funds limit how often withdrawals can be made
(see Chapter 7), and they place the same limits on any funds of funds
that invest with them. Therefore, a fund of funds has to place limits on
how often its investors can withdraw money.
Some funds of funds allow investors to sell their shares as new investors
come in. With this loophole, investors can get money out, but only if
they wait until others want to come in, and only if the fund of fund’s per-
formance is good enough to attract new buyers.
263
Chapter 15: Hooking Onto Other Types of Hedge Funds

 Complicated tax structure. Hedge funds are set up as partnerships, and
each investor is a limited partner in the fund (see Chapter 2). Come
April 15, tax day bloody tax day, each partner is responsible for a pro-
portionate share of the fund’s expenses and profits. The partners have
to pay taxes on gains, even if they won’t receive any cash until they exit
the fund (see Chapter 8 for more on tax considerations).
A fund of funds adds another layer. Each fund in the portfolio reports to
the fund of funds manager, who aggregates the expenses and profits and
reports them to each investor. At a minimum, the extra step means
you’ll probably have to file for an extension of the Internal Revenue
Service’s deadline.
 Excessive diversification. Diversification is great in and of itself, but too
much or poorly handled diversification can make investors worse off. If
you eliminate all risk with diversification, you may eliminate all return,
and if you don’t match the funds so that their risks offset, you may find
yourself taking on too much volatility in certain market conditions.
Funds of funds that invest in more than 25 hedge funds may be exces-
sively diversified; on the other hand, those with less than 5 may not be
diversified enough.
The Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory (MPT; see Chapter 6) says
that each additional asset added to a portfolio increases its diversifica-
tion by reducing some of the unique risk of the asset. When a portfolio
features 30 items, unique risk is statistically close to zero, meaning that
the expected return of the portfolio is the expected return of the market.
 High fees. You get an introduction to this in the previous section when I
present an advantage for funds of funds organizers: the high fees they
receive. For more a more detailed discussion, check out the following
section (and Chapters 2 and 4).
Multiple funds, multiple fees
Funds of funds are expensive — so much so that some observers call them
“fees of fees funds.” First, the managers of all the hedge funds in the fund of
funds portfolio charge their fees. On top of those fees, the fund of fund man-
ager charges an additional fee for his or her services. In some cases, an
investor may be better off in a traditional investment with poorer absolute
performance but better results after the fees.
Table 15-1 shows how layers of fees can erode investment return. For this
example, assume that a fund of funds placed $5 million in three different
hedge funds. Each fund charged a management fee equal to 2 percent of
beginning-of-year assets as well as a performance fee of 20 percent of invest-
ment profits. At that point, the fund of funds charged a fee equal to 1 percent
264
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

of beginning-of-year assets and a performance fee of 10 percent of the invest-
ment return. The result? A return of 19.3 percent before the fees chop the
return almost in half, to 10.5 percent. (See Chapter 2 for more on the fees
associated with hedge funds.)

Some funds of funds, mindful of the burden of the fees, are trying alternative
fee structures. Be sure to ask when you look into funds of funds.
Graduated performance fees
A hedge fund charges its performance fee on its first positive dollar. To prove
that they’re adding value with their fund manager selection, some funds of
funds managers charge performance fees only on the performance increase
over some reasonable return, like 8 percent or 10 percent. Unless the fund of
265
Chapter 15: Hooking Onto Other Types of Hedge Funds

funds returns at least that much, the fund of funds manager charges no fee.
(Remember, the hedge fund manager already took out a cut.) The reason for a
graduated performance fee is that otherwise, after you take all the fees into
account, the fund of funds may have a performance that’s average or even
below average relative to the performance of the market or simpler invest-
ments, like index mutual funds (mutual funds that invest in the same stocks
as a market index, like the S&P 500, in order to return approximately the
same amount). The graduated performance fee helps ensure that the fund of
funds manager adds value when selecting hedge funds for the fund of funds.
Negotiating with the hedge fund manager
Many hedge funds want to attract money. Funds of funds offer them large
pools of money in the control of sophisticated investors. Even though his or
her money may come from individual investors, the fund of funds manager
should understand the investment business well enough not to need much
hand-holding. The fund of funds won’t be looking to make big withdrawals,
either, because it won’t have the distribution requirements that some pen-
sion or endowment funds may have. Because of this, many hedge fund man-
agers are willing to offer funds of funds discounts off of management fees and
performance fees.
The big pot of money a fund of funds offers can be both a blessing and a
curse to a hedge fund manager. An investment from a big fund of funds can
help launch a hedge fund, but if the fund of funds pulls out the money, it can
destroy the hedge fund. Not all hedge fund managers welcome investments
from funds of funds.
Advancing to funds of funds of funds 
(I’m not making this up!)
The truly daring may be interested in another level of hedge-fund investing:
the so-called F3s, or “funds of funds of funds.” At first, people thought the
title was a joke, but it turns out that these investments are real. An F3 pools
investors’ money to put into funds of funds (see the previous sections). In
some cases, a financial advisor takes money from a handful of small clients
and pools the money to meet the minimum investment in a fund of funds
(which is almost always lower than the minimum investment in a hedge
fund). Naturally, the person forming the F3 charges a fee for this — usually
about 1 percent per year. This may sound cheap, but you need to account for
the additional 1 percent taken out of the investment return.
Some investors are interested in funds of funds of funds because they want to
be in hedge funds, without regard for whether this is an appropriate invest-
ment. Others are interested because a broker or other financial advisor is
pushing an F3 in order to get a commission, not because it’s a great investment.
266
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

Before you take on the fees of a fund of fund of funds, think long and hard
about whether you want your portfolio in hedge funds right now. Small
investors can get many of the same benefits through other investments,
which I cover in Chapter 16. And if you still want to inform people at a cock-
tail party that you’re in an F3, you can always lie. The lack of transparency in
hedge funds means that your nosy neighbor won’t be able to check up on you
(see Chapter 8).
Many hedge fund managers are already joking about the next investment
level: the F4, or the fund of funds of funds of funds. By the time you read this,
the F4 may be a reality, but it still won’t be a sign of progress for investors!
Hedge Funds by Any Other Name
A hedge fund can be pretty much anything you want it to be. It can be a rela-
tively low-risk, low-return investment that uses conventional investment
techniques, or it can be a high-risk endeavor that uses exotic strategies. It’s
simply a lightly regulated private investment partnership that removes
market risk, leaving only the value added by the manager’s skill — the so-
called alpha (see Chapter 6).
And guess what? Many investments are managed the same ways, even
though the managers don’t call them hedge funds. No rule states that a pri-
vate investment account can’t use short-selling, leverage, and other hedging
techniques in order to generate greater than expected return for a given level
of risk (see Chapter 11 for more on these techniques).
A hedge fund that solicits investors has to deal with only accredited investors
(see Chapter 2). But no rule can stop an investor with fewer assets, or more
assets, from hiring someone to manage an account. Some brokers and finan-
cial planners like to develop and recommend aggressive hedge-fund strategies
if they’re appropriate for their clients, and many money-management firms
take individual accounts of $100,000 or so. Your blowhard brother-in-law may
not be impressed that your financial planner put together an individually man-
aged beta-neutral portfolio for you (see Chapter 9 for more information), but
do you really need to impress him? However, it won’t be impressive if the
strategy isn’t appropriate for you, or if you pay more than you can afford to
make the investment.
If you’re an accredited investor, but you need more flexibility than a hedge
fund offers, an individually managed account may be for you. To get involved,
contact a brokerage firm, private bank, or wealth-management firm. However,
you need to keep an eye on the expenses and taxes incurred in an individu-
ally managed account. Great returns have a way of disappearing after you
pay all the commissions and fees. (See Chapter 2 for more on this topic.)

Chapter 15: Hooking Onto Other Types of Hedge Funds

Entering Mutual Funds That Hedge
In recent years, many mutual fund companies have formed several mutual
funds to follow some of the same investment strategies that hedge funds do.
(A mutual fund is a publicly traded investment that pools money from differ-
ent investors. They’re regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
and they’re mostly formed by companies that do this as their primary busi-
ness.) The mutual funds are late to the hedge fund party (sounds like a
blast!), and for good reason: For many years, securities laws forbid mutual
funds from short-selling or from using leverage (borrowing money; see
Chapter 11 for more on both topics) when investing. Changes to the laws in
1997 expanded the list of investment techniques that mutual funds can use.
If you’re not an accredited investor (see Chapter 2) but still want some exposure
to hedge fund investing techniques, you can now identify a handful of mutual
funds that pursue short-selling strategies, offering many of the risk-management
benefits of hedge funds to mutual fund investors, and more are scheduled for
introduction. These hedging mutual funds fall into two categories:
 Bear funds, which short-sell stocks that the managers believe are too
expensive
 Long-short funds, which try to manage market risk by buying shares in
stocks that appear to be inexpensive and short-selling stocks that
appear to be overpriced
You can discover more about mutual funds that follow some of the same
strategies as hedge funds in Chapter 16.

Hedging into a family office
Many wealthy families, especially those that
have had money for several generations, oper-
ate investment pools solely for their own bene-
fit. They hire personal portfolio managers who
may use the same techniques as hedge fund
managers to control the risk in the portfolios. In
essence, such family funds are private hedge
funds that you must be born into or — depend-
ing on the pre-nup — marry into. This is called
a family office. Of course, if you build a vast for-
tune for yourself, you may end up starting your
own! (Chapter 2 has more on this topic.)

A
full-fledged hedge fund may not be appropriate for you for a variety of
reasons. You may not be an accredited investor (see Chapter 2). You may
not be able to lock up your money for long periods of time (see Chapter 7). Or
you may not be able to buy into a fund that seems suitable for you. However,
these obstacles don’t prevent you from taking advantage of hedge-fund strate-
gies to protect your other investments in all types of market conditions.
Investors of all shapes and sizes can (and should) use diversification to
reduce risk and increase return — a staple of the hedge-fund strategy. Some
investors may also want to try their hands at more aggressive techniques,
like leverage (investing with borrowed money; see Chapter 11), short-selling
(selling borrowed shares of stocks expected to fall in price; see Chapter 11),
and using derivatives (options, futures, and so on; see Chapter 5). You can
diversify your investments to take advantage of natural hedges, which are 
offsetting risk and return relationships between asset classes. And, you can
enter mutual funds that follow certain hedge-fund investment styles without
the accredited-investor requirements. This chapter shows you how to make
these hedge-fund strategies and more work for you.

A Diversified Portfolio 
Is a Hedged Portfolio
You have a choice of different investment assets: stocks, bonds, cash, real
estate, and precious metals, to name a few. These assets all perform differ-
ently at different times over an economic or business cycle, which is why
long-term investors usually hold a mix of assets, figuring that some years will
bring fruitful returns and others will be down years. The process of mixing
the assets that investors hold is known as diversification.
Because different assets have different risk-and-return profiles, they offset
each other to generate smoother long-term performance. Some years, bonds
will be great performers but stocks will be disappointing. Other years, bonds
will be not-so-hot and stocks will be burning up the charts. That’s why
investors should buy some of each. Some people work with a mutual fund or
investment manager who promises a diversified portfolio, and others simply
buy a mix of assets to create diversification on their own.
Diversification is a long-run strategy, although it can have short-term bene-
fits. Over the long run, the performance of the different asset classes, work-
ing together, should lead to a solid long-run total return. In the short term,
you’ll have a little exposure to everything, meaning that you won’t miss out
when one asset class shows spectacular performance.
Many investors think that instead of diversifying, they should simply move
around their assets so that they’re always invested in the top-performing
asset. This strategy, however, requires clairvoyance, something that few
people have without a 900 number attached. I’ve never met someone who
enjoyed success with this strategy, although that could be because they’re
living in their beachfront houses on Maui rather than making mortgage pay-
ments in the Midwest. But beware: Following this strategy means you run the
risk of constantly selling at the bottom and buying at the top, a sure-fire way
to lose money (see Chapter 11 for info on buying low and selling high).
A slow-and-steady strategy 
works over the long run . . .
A diversified portfolio may not have stellar performance in any one year, but
in exchange, you get consistent performance over the long run. Not con-
vinced? Here’s an example: Say that you had $2,000 to invest at the beginning
of 1996. You put $1,000 in the S&P 500 (an index prepared by the Standard
and Poor’s Corporation that tracks the performance of 500 large American
272
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

companies) and another $1,000 in an absolute-return investment (see
Chapter 1) designed to generate a 10-percent return, year in and year out.
Table 16-1 shows what would’ve happened to your investments.

At the end of the 10 years, you would’ve been better off in the absolute-return
investment, but you would’ve sat with an investment that underperformed in
the early years. Many investors would’ve thrown their hands up in 1998 and
moved their money out of the absolute-return fund and into the S&P 500, just
in time for a big move up — followed by a long slide down.
A diversified portfolio requires some patience, just as any long-run invest-
ment strategy does. Diversification eliminates the problem of predicting
which assets will do best in which years, but it means that your portfolio
won’t do as well in years when a single asset class shows unprecedented,
high rates of return. When thinking about what investment style is right for
you, you have to decide if you’d rather have a steady return and give up the
excitement of the up years, or if you’d rather ride the roller coaster and end
up in the same place.

Chapter 16: Using Hedge-Fund Strategies without Hedge Funds

. . . But some investors want 
to hit a home run NOW
Many investors — professional and amateur alike — claim to invest for the
long run, but the reality is that they track the prices of their investments
daily. When you follow your investments like your fantasy sports teams, it
can be painful to sit with a portfolio designed for long-run, steady return
during a period when less-diversified portfolios are showing fabulous growth.
And maybe you don’t want to be in hedge funds to get a steady, low-risk 
8-percent or 10-percent return. Maybe you want to double your money this
year. Well, don’t we all? If doubling your money were easy, we would all move
to Las Vegas.
Some hedge funds have had long stretches of abnormally strong perfor-
mance, so such success is possible. Can you do it by yourself, on occasion?
Maybe. Here are two strategies that can help:
 Take on more risk by reducing the amount of diversification in your
portfolio.
 Continue diversifying by adding riskier assets than those already in your
portfolio.
The following sections explore these two approaches in more detail.
Reducing your diversification
If you’re after return, and you can live with some risk, a solution for you may
be to concentrate your investments into riskier assets. Investors often take
undiversified bets in one asset class (see Chapter 5 for more on asset classes).
Young investors tend to buy more stock than older investors because they
can accept more risk. Entrepreneurs may have almost all their assets in their
businesses, but they can live with that risk because they believe in what
they’re doing. You may not be hedging, technically, but remember: Not many
of what people call “hedge funds” are hedging, either.
Suppose you just barely have enough money to invest in a hedge fund, but
you still want to invest in one. So, you decide to sell all your stock and some
of your bonds and put all that money into a macro fund that invests in cur-
rencies and commodities outside the United States (see Chapter 13 for more
information on macro funds). In effect, you’ve reduced the amount of diversi-
fication in your portfolio by taking a large bet in one sector.
Diversification into riskier assets
Ah, you say, you’ve read Chapter 6, and one of the points I make there is that
diversification can actually increase return while reducing risk. So how do
you do that?
274
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

Well, you diversify into riskier assets! Here are some examples of this strategy:
 If you hold mostly cash, you can buy bonds.
 If you hold cash and bonds, you can buy stock.
 If you hold mostly U.S. assets, you can buy in markets outside the 
United States.
These assets you diversify with may have the same or greater risk on a stand-
alone basis as the assets you already have, but if the new assets don’t corre-
late with the old assets — in other words, if they don’t move up and down in
the same direction at the same time — you can improve your overall return
while reducing risk.
Diversification into riskier assets is the reason that big institutional investors
like pensions and endowments put money in risky, directional hedge funds (see
Chapter 1). Their small positions in aggressive commodities-trading funds or
highly leveraged global macro funds not only increase returns in the years that
those strategies do well, but also offset the risk in other parts of the portfolios.
To a finance professor, risk is the likelihood of getting any return other than the
return you expect to get. In these terms, if your investment does better than
expected, you took on risk. In the real world, most investors don’t see getting
more money than expected to be a risky proposition, which is why you need to
think about downside risk, not total risk. See Chapter 6 for more information.
Exploring Your Expanding Asset Universe
Hedge fund managers invest in a huge range of assets. If you look through
most of the chapters in Part III, you discover the many ways that a hedge
fund manager can make money. Currency. Commodities. Private equity.
Common stock. Options. Warrants. Convertibles. Plain-vanilla bonds. Selling
ice cream on eBay. (Just wanted to make sure that you’re still paying atten-
tion.) The list is long, and that’s the point: The easiest way for you to hedge
risk is to diversify holdings among your different assets with different risk
and return characteristics. You can do that without a net worth of a million
dollars and without paying a hedge fund manager a 20-percent performance
fee. After you develop a core portfolio of stocks, bonds, and cash, you can
think about adding positions in other assets. This section explores the asset
alternatives that you can explore, at least until you get that million dollars
(and even long after).
Individual investors should keep an emergency fund of cash equal to about
six months’ worth of expenses. Pension funds and endowments keep some of
their holdings in cash to meet their obligations, and so should you.
275
Chapter 16: Using Hedge-Fund Strategies without Hedge Funds

Rounding up the usual asset alternatives
If you’re interested in hedge-fund strategies and want to be involved with a
fund at some point, you’re probably familiar with stocks, bonds, and cash as
asset classes. However, at this stage in your investment career, you may not
be as familiar with some alternative investments that could help you round
out your investment portfolio. I dive into some alternatives in the pages that
follow.
International stock
The U.S. economy has a direct effect on the U.S. stock market. Other stock
markets don’t feel the same effect, or at least not to the same extent, which is
why one way to diversify your portfolio is to add international stock. You can
buy stock directly or through mutual funds — some of which buy shares in
companies all over the world, and some of which concentrate on certain mar-
kets. Which strategy is right for you depends in large part on what risks you
want to manage and what other assets you hold in your portfolio.
Table 16-2 shows what happens to an investor’s portfolio if he puts half the
money he allocates to U.S. equities into an international fund with a lower
beta but the same expected total return (you can find out about beta in
Chapter 6). The result? The same performance with less risk.

Now, you may be thinking, why not just put all the money in the international
fund? After all, it has a lower risk for the same return. You need to remember
that beta is calculated relative to the U.S. stock market. You choose the inter-
national fund because it has less correlation with the U.S. market, not neces-
sarily less total risk.
Foreign currencies
Want to hedge against volatility in the U.S. dollar? One easy way to combat
the dollar is to buy other currencies, like the euro or the yen. You could go to
the bank, exchange your bills, and then put them under a mattress, but then
you lose out on the interest you could earn on that money. A better tactic is
to put the money in a foreign currency certificate of deposit. One bank that
offers certificates is EverBank (www.everbank.com).
Another alternative is currency exchange-traded funds, which are investment
pools that trade on the stock exchanges. Exchange-traded funds that invest
in currencies hold cash in whatever currency that they’re designed to track —
like euros, British pounds, Mexican pesos, and so on — so their performance
matches the change in the price of the currency. If the currency increases in
value, so does the exchange-traded fund.
Commodities
Commodities are the raw materials of life: metals, minerals, agricultural prod-
ucts, and so on. You have four ways to add commodities to your diversified
portfolio:
 Buy the commodity outright. This strategy may not be practical — who
wants barrels of oil in the garage and wheat in the shed? — but it is pos-
sible, especially for some types of commodities that you can keep on
hand. For example, some coin dealers sell silver, gold, and platinum
coins and ingots.
277
Chapter 16: Using Hedge-Fund Strategies without Hedge Funds

 Increase your commodity exposure through exchange-traded futures
and options. These allow you to speculate on future price changes,
although trading can be complicated.
 Buy a commodity exchange-traded fund. This is an investment pool
that trades on the stock exchanges. It invests money in futures contracts
or in physical commodities so that the price of the exchange-traded
fund changes with the price of the commodities themselves.
 Buy stock in companies that operate in the commodities business. This
is the way to go if you don’t want to deal with storage and you don’t want
to trade derivatives. Oil companies have exposure to petroleum prices,
mining company shares go up with metals prices, and the prices of winter
wheat and pork bellies profoundly affect food processors, for example.
Other assets you may not have considered
One of the reasons academic models often don’t describe what actually hap-
pens in the markets is that in financial theory, a market is defined as every
possible asset that one could hold. In practice, that definition is way too
broad, so the models test by using market indexes or stock-exchange data
that exclude huge categories of assets.
You don’t want to make that mistake with your personal investments! When
you think about how to best diversify your portfolio in the interest of reduc-
ing risk, mimicking the investment strategy of a hedge fund, think about
every asset you have. The two easiest assets to overlook are your own earn-
ing capacity, or your human capital, and your house.
Your human capital
Investors often overlook their greatest asset: their human capital. The ability
to go out and make a living often trumps the ability to get an unusually large
return on investable assets, which is a good thing. If your retirement savings
fall short, you can always work a year or two longer. You may not want to, but
at least your ability to work cushions your risk.
However, you have heavy exposure to the industry in which you ply your
trade, so keep that in mind when you choose your investments. Many compa-
nies offer their employees good deals on company stock, and some compa-
nies even use the stock to match employee retirement contributions. These
perks are great when your employer is doing well, but if your employer isn’t
enjoying much success, you could lose both your job and your life’s savings
(Enron, anyone?). To reduce your risk, you should consider diversifying your
holdings away from your industry and your employer.
Institutional investors don’t have human capital to fall back on if they have a
bad year or two. As an individual, you have that key advantage.
278
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

Residential real estate
Your personal residence may be an investment, or it may be insurance
against risk. Its label depends in part on your personal preference and in part
on your investment strategy. If your place is completely paid for, you have a
place to live regardless of what happens to your job and the markets. Even if
the value of your house declines, you won’t need to move. For this reason,
many corporations and almost all universities own their land and buildings
outright instead of financing them.
For the most part, land is a store of value. It increases in price at about the same
rate as inflation, so you can sell it and get back the same purchasing power that
you put into it. Land isn’t so much an investment as a safety net. In some cases,
it appreciates faster than inflation, especially if an area becomes more desirable.
Despite conventional wisdom and your real-estate agent’s advice, real estate
doesn’t always go up in value, especially when you take inflation into account.
Real estate can be a risky investment. One way that people increase their risk
is by borrowing money to buy property. (Unfortunately, that’s also the only
way that many people can afford their primary residences!) By taking out a
mortgage, you make a bet that the price will increase faster than inflation or
that the interest rate will soon be less than inflation. If either of those situa-
tions comes to fruition, you’ll post a real return greater than inflation.
No matter how you finance it and no matter what your philosophy toward
risk, residential real estate doesn’t perform exactly like other investments. By
including it in your portfolio, you offset some of the risk of your other invest-
ments, which is what hedging is all about.
Structuring a Hedge-Filled Portfolio
You have several ways to structure a hedge in order to reduce risk without
necessarily reducing return. You can use complex computer programming to

Separating luxuries and investments
People sometimes justify frivolous purchases by
thinking of them as investments. Calling many
items “investments” makes them sound neces-
sary, but face it, most of them are not. Most cars
go down in value. Diamonds are expensive
mostly because a cartel controls their sale —
ask any jilted bride what she got when she tried
to return her ring. An expensive suit may help
you get a job or win a client, but it will ultimately
end up at the thrift shop. Art sometimes goes up
in value, but not always. And can you really get
someone to buy your stuffed-animal collection?
Go ahead and spend your money if you want,
but don’t confuse luxuries with investments.

make the hedge perfect, or you can do it yourself and get most of the way
there.
Most brokers, financial planners, and investment consultants have access to
programs that can help you find offsets for some of the risks in your portfolio.
Even if these gurus don’t recommend a hedge fund — and even if a hedge fund
isn’t suitable for you — they can still help you use some hedging techniques.
Recognizing natural hedges
A natural hedge is a built-in protection that already exists in your business 
or personal life. For example, if a business has both revenue and expenses in
the same foreign currency, it has a natural hedge against the fluctuation of
that currency relative to the U.S. dollar. If you work in technology and your
spouse works in social services, you have a natural hedge in your family’s
human capital because the chances are low that you would both be out of
work at the same time.
When you examine your investment portfolio, be sure to define it broadly
enough to think about where you may have natural hedges. If you own a lot of
bonds, for example, you have a lot of exposure to inflation, but if you have a
fixed-rate mortgage on your house and have recently inherited a rare-coin
collection, you have some natural hedges against deterioration in the price of
the bonds.
When you’re looking at the natural hedges in your accounts, sit and think:
What could go wrong? How can you insure against these events? How much
are you willing to pay to insure against something going wrong, like interest
rates going up or the stock market going down or the dollar changing in value?
The natural hedges you find may not be in your portfolio, but rather in your
lifestyle. If you own your house outright, you can afford more variability in
your retirement investments than if you expect to be making house payments
while you’re collecting Social Security. If a university can cover its basic oper-
ating expenses through tuition, its endowment fund can take more risk than if
its income is vital to the short-term survival of the institution.
There’s no such thing as a free lunch when investing. Investment return is a
function of risk. If you give up all risk, you give up all potential for return.
When you understand your risk, you can start to think about what you need
to hedge. Do you need to hedge your earnings power for next year (possibly
with disability insurance)? Hedge the value of your portfolio against huge
swings in value (possibly by using options and futures)? Lock in the return on
280
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

company stock that you can’t sell for six more years? With a sense of the dol-
lars and time involved, you can take a more quantitative approach.
Doing the math
A qualitative analysis of your holdings and your risk levels can get you pretty
far (see the previous section), but you may want to go further in order to more
precisely hedge your portfolio by crunching some numbers. Two alternatives
include matching your cash flow obligations and portfolio optimization.
Matching cash flows
If you examine your finances for several years, you can see some of the differ-
ent payments that become due:
For an individual: Mortgage, college tuitions, new cars, retirement
spending, and so on
For an institution: New dorms, scholarships, expanded laboratories, pen-
sions, and so on
With a list in hand, you can structure an investment to match the cash flow
needs of each situation. For example, if you have ongoing mortgage payments
that you must fund, one solution is a bond or other fixed-income investment
that generates interest payments equal to the mortgage payments. Also, if
you don’t need your retirement money for 40 years, you can invest it more
aggressively to generate maximum capital gains — and re-adjust your invest-
ing as needed before the 40 years are up.
Portfolio-management tactics can help you separate how much money you
can put into risky, illiquid investments and how much money you need to
keep safe. In other words, you figure out how much return you need and
when (see Chapter 7).
And yes, hedge fund managers use the same tactics. If they allow investors to
make withdrawals, they need to make sure that they have enough cash on
hand to meet the withdrawals. They also need to generate cash for the man-
agement and performance fees (see Chapter 2). The managers can keep the
rest of their portfolios in longer-term investments.
Portfolio optimization
Portfolio optimization is a mathematical process that attempts to maximize
portfolio return and minimize risk, given whatever measure of risk you choose
(see Chapter 6). The risk measure may be beta, or the correlation of a security
281
Chapter 16: Using Hedge-Fund Strategies without Hedge Funds

with the market under the Capital Assets Pricing Model (which I also discuss
in Chapter 6), or it may be value at risk (see Chapter 14), the maximum dollar
loss expected in a time period with a specified confidence level — say, 95 
percent.
For the most part, you have to purchase the software required to do an opti-
mization, or you have to access it through a broker or financial advisor. It’s
difficult, but not impossible, to do a good optimization on your own. If you
want to try, go to www.spreadsheetmodeling.com/free_samples.htm
to see a portfolio optimization spreadsheet created by Craig Holden, author
of Excel Modeling (Prentice Hall), a textbook on portfolio optimization.
You (and hedge fund managers) measure risk and return historically. No
matter the quality of the optimization software you purchase and the data
that you put into it, the results won’t be perfect because the future will never
be exactly like the past.
Utilizing Margin and Leverage 
in Your Accounts
Not all hedge fund managers structure their funds to reduce risk. Some take
on huge risks, with the goal of generating huge returns in the process. The
expected returns may be greater than anticipated for the amount of risk
taken, but take note: Risk is taken. An easy way for you to follow this hedge-
fund strategy and increase risk is through leverage — the use of borrowed
funds to make an investment.
Chapter 11 covers how hedge funds use leverage to increase return. The
same techniques are available to you. However, you have to meet necessary
net-worth requirements and intermediate payments while you wait for your
investment to work out, which can put pressure on your portfolio. And if
your leveraged investment fails, you still have to repay the loan.
Hedge funds also borrow money to make trades. You can follow this strategy,
too, through a margin account (see Chapter 11). You can open a margin
account at almost any brokerage firm through an application called a margin
agreement. After the agreement is in place, you can borrow up to 50 percent
of your investment — a rate set by the Federal Reserve Bank to ensure that
markets function even if a crash occurs.
Here’s an example. Say you want to purchase 400 shares of a stock at a price
of $25.00. Your total investment is $10,000, and you borrow $5,000 at an inter-
est rate of 10 percent. Table 16-3 shows you how the margin works and what
you can expect in terms of return.

The $5,000 loan you take out to buy the stock leads to a huge return if the
stock price goes up (to $40.00). However, because you have to pay interest,
the margin trade loses money if the stock stays flat or goes down. If the stock
price declines, you may have to put more money in your account, too. The
tradeoff for the increased return is increased risk.
The following sections discuss leverage and how you can use margin and
derivatives to manage risk in investment portfolios. Hedge fund managers
use these techniques, and you can, too. (I introduce derivatives, which are
contracts that draw their value from the price of a different security, in
Chapter 5.)
Derivatives for leverage and hedging
You can use derivatives — or options and futures (see Chapter 5) — both to
protect your investment positions and to generate high levels of return.
Derivatives transactions have built-in leverage because you put up only a
small amount of money to buy exposure to a security’s price.
For example, a call option gives the owner the right to buy a stock at a set
price in the future. If the stock goes up in price, the option has a lot of value,
especially relative to the price the owner paid for it.
Allow me to illustrate my point. Say a stock has a current price of $61.00. The
strike price (which is the price where the option can be executed) is $65.00,
and the option price is $0.85. If you purchase options on 100 shares, your
total price is $85. You’re out that money no matter what happens. Tables 16-4
and 16-5 use this information to show you how derivatives add leverage to a
portfolio and may generate a big return for a relatively small initial purchase.
Option contracts are priced on a per-share basis and issued to cover a lot of
100 shares, so you would need one contract for each 100 shares.

You may have noticed that every dollar the option buyer makes, the option
seller ends up losing. Options are a zero sum game. Every winner creates an
equal loser. Value is traded, not created.
Sure, you can use derivatives to add risk and return to your portfolio, but you
can also use them to hedge risk. Many hedge fund managers rely on deriva-
tives to minimize risk and maximize return. The following sections dive
deeper into this topic.
The information in this chapter isn’t enough to get you started in derivatives
trading. If you want to discover more, check out the courses offered by the
Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com/LearnCenter) and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (www.cme.com/edu). And, of course, you can

284
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

Derivatives make brokers rich, but they don’t always do the same for clients.
The commissions to small investors can be high, and because options and
futures expire on a regular basis, folks who invest in them have to trade con-
stantly. Derivatives may be right for you, but do your homework to make sure
that your financial broker is acting in your best interest and not in his.
Options
An option gives you the right to buy or sell an asset in the future at a price set
in the present. But an option doesn’t require you to buy or sell; you use the
option only if you can use it to your advantage. For example, if you buy an
option that allows you to buy shares of stock at $65 per share in three months,
and in three months the stock is trading at $50, you wouldn’t exercise the
option. You’d be out whatever you paid for it, but no more.
A call option gives you the right to buy, and a put option gives you the right to
sell. How might you use these options to hedge?
 If you want to protect a long position — that is, the price of securities
that you own — you should buy a put. If the price goes down, you have
the right to sell at a set price.
 If you want to protect a short position — that is, borrowed stock you sell
in hopes of repaying when the stock goes down in price — you should
buy a call. At that point, you have the right to repurchase the stock at a
set price.
Suppose you own 20,000 shares in your company’s stock (at an initial price
per share of $50), in total currently worth $1,000,000, but you can’t sell any
shares right now. In six months you plan to retire and be able to sell, and you
want to use that money to buy a condo in Florida. To ensure that the money
stays put, you use a strategy known as a straddle that expires in six months;
in other words, you sell a call option and use the proceeds to buy a put. If the
stock price goes up, you’ll have to sell it, but you’ll lock in the value of your
holding. If the stock price goes down, you can put the stock to the seller of
the option (which means that you’ll force the seller of the option to buy the
stock from you), also locking in your value.
Table 16-6 shows you the breakdowns for selling a call option and buying a
put option. Table 16-7 shows you what happens with the return to the buyer
of the call option.

The put and the call have the same price, so the straddle has no upfront cost.
You’re now guaranteed a value of at least $700,000 in six months, and it can
go up to a maximum value of $1,300,000. What happens if another business
takes over your company and the stock doubles or even triples? You have
$1,300,000. Don’t laugh — it happened to Ted Turner when AOL acquired
Time-Warner. Experts estimate that a straddle he had in place caused him to
give up $190 million. He had a lot of Time-Warner stock that he picked up
when he sold CNN to the company, and he was not allowed to sell it right
away. To protect his portfolio from the possibility of the stock going down in
price, he bought puts; to cover the cost of the puts, he sold calls. He had no
idea of knowing that the stock would go up as much as it did, because not
every Ted Turner is clairvoyant. Return is compensation for taking risk, so
keep in mind that if you give up some risk, you may also give up some return.
286
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

Futures
A futures contract lets you lock in a price for an asset or a market index.
Unlike an option (see the previous section), you commit to a futures contract:
You have the obligation to pay up. Almost all investors settle futures with
cash, not with their underlying assets. So, if you agree to sell corn at a speci-
fied future price, you don’t have to go out and find a farmer to deliver the
product.
You buy a future if you want to add a type of risk to your portfolio, either to
speculate or to diversify, and you sell a future if you want to remove a risk —
and removing a risk is the same as hedging. Futures have a finite life, so you
have to close out the transactions at some point. Here are a few examples of
where futures may be the way to go:
 If you want to add exposure to pork bellies
 If you want to sell off your interest-rate risk
 If you want to lock in the yen/euro exchange rate
Here’s an illustration of the second bullet: You have a large bond portfolio that
you plan to use to pay for your son’s college education. He’s a high-school
junior, so you don’t want to put any money into the stock market or other
assets. However, you’re concerned that if interest rates go up, the value of
your portfolio will go down. To reduce your interest-rate risk, you sell interest-
rate futures. (See Chapters 10 and 11 for more info on futures strategies.)
Short-selling as a hedging 
and leverage strategy
Short-selling is the process of borrowing a security, selling it, and then hoping
that the price declines so that you can buy the security back at a lower price
in order to repay the loan. Short-selling is a popular tactic with hedge fund
managers, because it allows their funds to make money even when the mar-
kets are going down. (See Chapter 11 for some of the different short-selling
strategies that hedge funds use.)
Short-selling is also a form of leverage. Not only do you borrow the shares
you sell, but also you can invest the proceeds of your sales into other securi-
ties. The risk? You need to cover the short at some point, an expensive
proposition if the security goes up in price rather than down. And yes, if the
security more than doubles in price, you can lose more than 100 percent of
your original investment.
287
Chapter 16: Using Hedge-Fund Strategies without Hedge Funds

I see no reason why you can’t use short-selling as a strategy as well. Just keep
in mind that whenever you borrow, you increase your risk. And, in the long
run, markets have an upward bias as long as the economy is growing, so
short-selling goes against that trend. I’m not saying you can’t make money,
but you need to do very careful research on the securities that you plan to
sell short.
More leverage! Other sources 
of borrowed funds
You can add leverage to your portfolio by borrowing money from other
sources to invest, thereby increasing the risk, and the potential return, in
your overall investment portfolio. Options include the following:
 Taking a home equity line of credit
 Borrowing against a retirement plan or life-insurance policy
 Taking out a personal loan to fund an investment account
Just because you can add leverage doesn’t mean you should. Few individual
investors should take on more leverage than they can with a margin account.
In only a very few cases is borrowing against home equity a suitable way to
fund an investment account; for instance, if you know that a payment like a
bonus from work is coming to you very soon, interest rates are low, and you
have a need to make an investment now and not when the bonus arrives.
Think long and hard about adding leverage, and make sure you consult with
your spouse or other co-owner of your property. Your spouse may not know
much about leverage, but you don’t want to see the look on his/her face
when you explain that you have lost everything and still owe money.
Hedge Fund Strategies in Mutual Funds
Mutual funds are publicly traded investment pools. Investors buy shares in
them and use the money to buy securities. For decades, laws prohibited
mutual funds from tactics such as short-selling, but a specific law, the so-
called “short-short rule,” was repealed in 1997. Now, you can find a handful of
mutual funds that offer the hedging of a traditional hedge fund without the
accredited-investor requirement, long lockup, or high minimum investment
(see Chapters 1 and 2).
288
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

Hedge-fund style mutual funds fall into three categories:
 Bear funds
 Long-short funds
 Funds of funds
You should keep these funds in mind if you aren’t sure hedge funds are right
for you or if you can’t meet the accredited-investor requirement but you still
want to search for suitable investments for your portfolio.
Bear funds
Bear funds are mutual funds that are invested under the assumption that the
stock market is going to go down. Bear funds are designed to make money in
bad markets. In order to make money in bad markets, the fund managers use
a combination of short-selling (see Chapter 11), hedging, and investments in
assets that tend to have low or negative correlations with the market — that
is, they’re likely to perform better when the market is down. If you’re feeling
negative about the market, a bear fund may help you profit from your pes-
simism. If you simply have no idea what the market will do, including a bear
fund among your other holdings can reduce the risk associated with getting
your expected average return.
Experts aren’t exactly sure why or when markets became categorized as bear
markets (down) or bull markets (up). Folks who are optimistic about the
market are called bulls, and the pessimists are known as bears. Some think
the terms developed because when attacked, bulls charge and bears retreat.
Long-short mutual funds
A long-short mutual fund is designed to be market-neutral. In theory, its perfor-
mance should be consistent no matter what the market does. The manager of
a long-short fund buys shares (goes long) in the best companies in an indus-
try and then sells borrowed shares (goes short) for the worst companies. The
idea is that no matter what the market does, winners and losers will emerge
in every market sector. By matching pairs of stocks, fund managers cancel
out much of the market risk.
Some long-short managers look for good and bad stocks, regardless of indus-
try. Others prefer to be mostly long when they expect the market to do well
and mostly short when they expect it to do poorly.
289
Chapter 16: Using Hedge-Fund Strategies without Hedge Funds

Mutual fund of funds
A mutual fund of funds is a mutual fund that takes shares in different mutual
funds to build a balanced portfolio. Some people design funds of funds with
time targets or risk levels in mind, and others simply want to diversify. The
key is to know what funds the fund of funds invests in and to make sure that
your portfolio needs this level of diversification. If you already own a mix of
stocks and bonds, you don’t need a stock-and-bond fund to help you diver-
sify; you may need a bear fund, an international fund, or a currency fund,
however.

Hiring a Consultant to Help 
You with Hedge Funds
In This Chapter
 Examining a consultant’s function
 Locating a consultant who meets your needs
 Distinguishing between hard- and soft-dollar consultants
 Squashing conflicts of interest
T
he decision to invest in a hedge fund is a big one — especially consider-
ing it often involves a large investment that could be locked up for years.
Funds are structured as private partnerships, so a person buying into a hedge
fund needs to know whom he or she will be going into partnership with, and
that partner is the hedge fund manager. Investors want advice that helps
them make good decisions, and fund workers who have to report their deci-
sions to a board of directors or a regulatory agency want assurance that
they’ve acted prudently and appropriately.
For all these reasons and more, hedge fund investors often work through 
consultants — people who sort through the available funds to make recom-
mendations to their clients. In this chapter, I give you the rundown on consul-
tants. I let you in on what consultants do. I give you everything you need but
a map to find the right consultant for you. You find out how consultants
structure their pay. Finally, I help you avoid conflicts of interest. Not all con-
sultants are neutral parties, so you need to find a good one before making the
leap into a fund.
Who Consultants Work For
Investment consulting is a big business, and the services of consultants are in
demand for pensions, endowments, foundations, and other investors who are

accountable to others. The staff and trustees at investment organizations
often need more information than they can gather on their own, and they
need to prove that they performed an objective analysis when they made
decisions about how to invest their money (see Chapter 8 for more).
Most consultants work only with institutional investors, but some may pro-
vide services to high-net-worth individuals — the kind who often look to
invest in hedge funds.
Smaller accredited investors — people who don’t have millions of dollars to
put into hedge funds — may be able to get some of the services that invest-
ment consultants provide from other professionals, like lawyers, accoun-
tants, or financial planners.
What Do Consultants Do 
(Besides Consult)?
What do these consultants do for an investor, and how can they help in the
hedge-fund decision process? Well, they do the following jobs that I cover in
greater detail throughout the rest of this section:
 Offer an analysis of the investor’s investment objectives.
 Make recommendations about asset allocation to optimize performance.
 Collect information on the risk-and-return performance of different asset
managers.
 Introduce suitable investors to hedge fund managers who may be able to
improve their overall investment performance.
Analyzing performance
A key task for a consultant is to analyze performance. Many consultants
maintain their own performance databases or subscribe to detailed informa-
tion collected by other services. They perform detailed statistical analysis to
determine the following:
 How well funds performed relative to the risks that they took
 What risks the funds actually took
 How you may expect the funds to perform in different market conditions
292
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

I bet I know what you’re asking right now: Just whose performance do these
consultants analyze? Well, they analyze performance both for the investor
and for the funds that the investor may consider:
 Performance analysis for the investor: For the investor, the consultant
looks at how the individual’s or organization’s investments performed
over the last quarter and the last year. He should include a look at risk,
return, and investment objectives. At that point, the consultant makes
recommendations for portfolio rebalancing (adjustments that will bring
the portfolio back into compliance with its risk, return, and other objec-
tives) based on how the client’s investments performed and how the
objectives have changed since the last period.
 Performance analysis for the funds: Many consultants compile data-
bases of hedge funds and funds of funds (see Chapter 15), including
detailed analysis of fees, risk, and return. Research often includes the
use of statistical and technical measures like the Sharpe measure, which
I discuss in Chapter 14.
Some consultants have collected years of data on different funds, and this
archive of information can help an investor thinking about a hedge fund
understand what may happen in different market scenarios and how different
fund strategies can pay off. The store of info can also help an investor dis-
cover more about a person who starts a new hedge fund; if the person
worked for a different fund in the past, that fund’s performance may offer
clues to how he may do now that he’s on his own.
Determining your investment objectives
A consultant can help you determine what investment objectives you should
implement and how you can manage your money to achieve and stay true to
your objectives. For an institutional investor like a pension, a foundation, or
an endowment, this process may involve interviews with stakeholders,
research into the history of the organization, and strategic planning.
If the organization is a pension or other type of fund that has to meet a series
of future payments, it can hire a consultant to determine how well its current
investment assets will meet those liabilities. The consultant may help put
together an investment policy that guides the fund’s investment choices
based on its investment objectives, and he or she may provide education to
show everyone in the organization how they can best meet their obligations
for investing the money.
293
Chapter 17: Hiring a Consultant to Help You with Hedge Funds

Putting a hedge fund manager 
under the microscope
Investigating a fund manager is difficult but necessary work. After all, your
investment is probably a big one, and your money may be locked away for
many years. Even if the fund you’re interested in is registered with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (see Chapter 3), it isn’t subject to a lot
of regulatory oversight, so you better feel confident about your decision. In
Chapter 18, you discover more about how you should perform due diligence
on a fund. What you need to know now is that the process is a lot of work,
and it’s the kind of work that consultants often do for their clients.
What are the advantages of relying on a consultant to check out a fund?
Consultants have an advantage in due diligence because they may already
have some information collected on different funds, making the process go
faster. As intermediaries, they’re also more willing to ask tough questions
than their clients themselves would be comfortable with.
Consultants may have huge conflicts of interest. Investors often hire them to
recommend specific hedge funds based on analysis of their needs, informa-
tion about the hedge funds’ performance, and due diligence that the consul-
tants perform. The problem is that hedge funds may hire consultants to do
performance analysis, and the consultants may receive commissions or fees
from the hedge funds when their clients make investments. Or, the consultants
may be employed by the hedge funds’ prime brokers, which are the brokerage
firms that handle most of the funds’ trades; that means the consultants would
be more interested in generating money for the funds than in looking out for
investors. A consultant receiving money from a hedge fund may have a hard
time making an unbiased recommendation to a hedge fund investor.
Optimizing your portfolio
The topic of portfolio optimization comes up elsewhere in this book (see
Chapter 16 for an example). When you optimize your portfolio, you figure out
how to diversify it in order to maximize your return and minimize your risk,
given your set of investment objectives (see the section “Determining your
investment objectives”). The process is technical, involving statistical know-
how and computing power — two areas of expertise best left to profes-
sionals. Consultants, to the rescue!
294
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

Managing a Request for Proposal (RFP)
Many organizations and some wealthy individual investors looking to invest
in hedge funds start by sending out a Request for Proposal (RFP) — some-
times called a Request for Quote (RFQ). This document outlines exactly what
the investor wants, and it poses a set of questions to the hedge fund manager
to find out what the fund can do. Many investors hire consultants to help
manage the RFP process, so many consulting firms offer the service upfront.
RFPs are as different as the clients and consultants who put them together,
but the issuing consulting firm usually starts by listing the minimum require-
ments of a winning bid so that unqualified investors don’t spend time putting
together a proposal.
Along with any applicable deadlines and information on what the finished bid
should look like, the RFP lists the following items that the bidder — in this
case, an investment firm — must provide:
 Firm name, address, and contact information
 A history of the firm
 Résumés or biographies of key employees
 A list of the fund’s accountant firm, prime broker, and other professional
service providers
 Copies of any U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (see Chapter 3),
National Association of Securities Dealers, or Commodity Futures
Trading Commission filings
 Explanations of any regulatory sanctions, disciplinary investigations, or
recent litigation
 Clients whom the investor can contact for reference
 A description of the hedge fund’s investment objectives and the strate-
gies that it will use to meet them
 Historical risk-and-return data, with an explanation of how the fund cal-
culated the numbers
 The fund’s fee structure
Consultants and funds of funds
Because investment consultants often know so much about the structures
and investment styles of different hedge funds, some parlay their knowledge
295
Chapter 17: Hiring a Consultant to Help You with Hedge Funds

into success in the fund of funds business, although some prefer the term
“manager of managers.” Funds of funds are investment pools that invest in
several different hedge funds in an attempt to maximize the potential return
and diversify (or reduce) some of the risk. (Chapter 15 has more information
on funds of funds.)
A fund of funds is a great way for the consultant to put his big database to
work. The consultant’s interest becomes closely allied with the interests of
his clients. Most fund of funds managers receive a cut of the performance, so
they make the most money when their clients do well. That’s pretty good,
right?
Yep, you guessed it . . . here’s the catch. The fund of funds manager usually
charges an asset-management fee for services. If the same consulting firm
charging you good money for its advice recommends that you invest in its
fund of funds, well, you just may have to deal with a conflict of interest.
Your consultant’s fund of funds may be a good investment for you, or it may
not be. The best way to know whether the consultant is looking out for your
best interests is to do your homework first. Know what your investment
objectives are and what the fund of fund’s performance and investment
restrictions are.
Hunting for the Hedge-Fund Grail: 
A Qualified Consultant
The good news is that finding a consultant who fits your needs is easier than
finding a hedge fund that does the same (or is that bad news?). Consultants
are out there talking to investors. They advertise in places where investors
can find them, attend investor conferences, and feature Web sites and listed
phone numbers — a tactic some hedge funds are loath to employ for fear of
accidentally marketing to non-accredited investors (people without a net
worth of $1 million or a yearly income of $200,000 [$300,000 with a spouse];
see Chapter 2). Many funds prefer to have consultants serve as go-betweens
rather than deal with investors directly.
So, to aid in your search and to appease the paranoid hedge funds, I provide
the following sections full of detailed information on how to pick the right
consultant for you.
296
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

Following recommendations and referrals
The best way to find an investment consultant is the best way to find any pro-
fessional service provider: Ask for recommendations and referrals from
people you trust who have similar situations (in this case, similar investment
situations). For example, if you’re a board member on a charitable endow-
ment that’s considering a hedge-fund investment, talk to board members or
staffers at similar charities that have already worked with consultants. If
you’re an individual investor, you can talk to your lawyer, accountant, or
another advisor for referrals.
Many investment consultants are active in trade organizations for nonprofit
organizations, pensions, and endowments. You may know people, or know of
them, who work in these environments. Don’t be shy about contacting multi-
ple sources and building a potential consultant list. At that point, you can
pick up the phone and start the next step: meeting the consultant and check-
ing her out.
Some consultants lock down clients by wining and dining them. If you’re in a
position of fiduciary responsibility (see Chapter 8 for more information about
this topic), make sure you choose your consultant for valid business reasons
that benefit the owner(s) of the money that you’re investing. Otherwise, you
may be breaking the law.
Performing another round of due diligence
Naturally, you should check out the consultant who piques your interest
before you hire him. You wouldn’t hire a nanny to watch your kids just
because she seems sweet, right? (And maybe your money is your baby!) Here
are some ways you can check up on your potential consultant:
 Call up other clients for references (see the previous section).
 Search online databases to see what you can find out (see Chapter 18 for
some that are useful).
 Verify any U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission registrations the
consultant may hold at www.sec.gov.
 Check with trade organizations like the CFA Institute to make sure the
consultant has the credentials he claims to have. You can look up contact
information for issuing organizations online and then call up the organi-
zation and ask if the consultant really holds the claimed credential.

Chapter 17: Hiring a Consultant to Help You with Hedge Funds

Most consultants, like most professional service providers, have nothing to
hide, so your search shouldn’t turn up anything interesting. But if you do find
something unusual that involves the consultant or his firm, wouldn’t you like
to know before signing a contract?
Managing Conflicts of Interest
Face it: The hedge fund investor hires the consultant, but that doesn’t mean
that the consultant is completely objective. Some consultants have very seri-
ous conflicts of interest. You need to ask some questions to make sure that
the person you hire is working for you. After all, this is your money. You’re
using your money to make an investment, and you’re using your money to
pay for the consultant’s services.
The biggest conflict is that the consulting firm may be receiving compensa-
tion from the hedge fund for finding investors. That means that the consul-
tant has an incentive to put you in a fund that’s almost, but not quite, right
for you. If the consultant’s firm puts together fund of funds products, it may
also have an incentive to recommend that investment option, whether or not
it’s ideal for you.
Other conflicts are more subtle. The consultant may want access to the
hedge fund manager for other clients, so he recommends the fund to you in
order to keep up his relationship with the fund. Maintaining access may be
on the consultant’s mind even if the consulting firm wants performance infor-
mation only for the firm’s analysis products.
So, what do you do? Your first option is to ask consultants about compensa-
tion and business arrangements that may create conflicts of interest. After
you identify possible conflicts, you can figure out if you can live with them or
not. If you decide that you can accept them, see if you can set up offsetting
fee arrangements (in other words, paying the consultant the equivalent of a
commission for choosing a non-commission fund) or the use of additional
research sources.
The consultants aren’t the only ones who may have conflicts of interest. If
you’re working for a pension plan, endowment, or trust, you have to make
sure that you represent the best interests of the people who depend on that
money. In some cases, those interests may be different from what’s best for
you as an individual. Consultants and investment managers sometimes throw
lavish parties, send out hard-to-get sports tickets, and pick up the tabs at fancy
restaurants for their clients. Don’t let those actions cloud your judgment.
298
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

Compensating Consultants 
for Their Services
Consultants can get paid in many different ways. Some pay arrangements can
save you money, but others can create conflicts of interest. Many consultants
work on a retainer basis: You pay a monthly fee that goes toward the consul-
tant’s time and materials. In exchange, you receive ongoing services. Some
consultants work on a fee-for-service basis, sending you a bill for each service
that you need. Some consulting firms offer alternatives to the fee-based
model, and a few collect both fees from investors and other types of compen-
sation from hedge funds. The fee structure affects the price you’ll pay and the
service you’ll receive.
In the investment business, most folks group the many payout options into two
sectors: hard dollars and soft dollars. Hard dollars are cash expenditures —
what you usually spend when you need to pay for something. Soft dollars are
commission credits. Soft dollars give an investment fund or money manager 
a way to pay for consulting and other services without writing a big check.
However, not all consultants accept soft dollars. I jump headfirst into these
topics in the following sections.
If you’re a political junky, you may know that soft dollars of another type are
a controversial form of campaign finance. In politics, soft dollars are contri-
butions to specific candidates made through third parties, like party organi-
zations, in order to circumvent legal limits on the size of donations.
299
Chapter 17: Hiring a Consultant to Help You with Hedge Funds
Questions to ask a consultant
Before you hire a consultant, here are a few
questions to ask about the consultant’s back-
ground and services:
 What’s the background of your staff mem-
bers? Who will be working on my account?
 How do you get paid for services? Do you
accept soft dollars (see the section
“Compensating Consultants for Their
Services”)?
 Do you prefer to work on retainer or on a
fee-for-service basis? What services are
included in the retainer?
 What types of clients do you work with?
Can you give me the names of clients who
have similar accounts?
 How do you work with hedge funds? Do you
offer them services on a fee basis? Do they
pay you for referrals?
 Do you offer investor conferences? Who
underwrites them?
 Do you offer any fund of funds’ or manager
of managers’ services?

Hard-dollar consultants
Hard dollar is another term for cash. Some hard-dollar consultants work on a
strict fee-for-service basis. They pride themselves on not taking any money
from hedge fund managers or others who invest money. This policy reduces
conflicts of interest, but it can be expensive. The process is simple: The con-
sultant performs the service and sends the client a bill. The client writes a
check and pays the bill. Other consultants prefer to work on retainer. I cover
both options in the sections that follow.
A la carte consulting
If your consultant bills you each time you use her service, she’s billing you
for an a la carte service. You pay only for the services you need as you need
them. For example, the consultant may write a Request for Proposal for you
(see the section “Managing a Request for Proposal [RFP]”) and then send you
a bill for the work.
You need to be on the lookout for two potential pitfalls in the a la carte
system:
 The consultant has an incentive to push you to buy additional services
that you may not need. Your consultant could turn into the fast-food
clerk who asks if you want fries with your burger.
 You may become too conscious of what you’re spending and turn down
services that you could benefit from buying.
Retainers
Many hard-dollar consultants prefer to work on a retainer basis: You agree to
pay a fixed amount per month or per year, and in exchange you can rely on
the consultant for regular reports, updates, and research projects. Unless an
unusual project crops up in the middle of the year (such as a corporate
takeover that may affect the management of a pension fund), your retainer
covers the costs of all the services you need.
Paying on retainer is an expensive way to go, because you pay for the consul-
tant’s time whether or not you need it. However, it may be the best option for
you, especially if you don’t have the benefit of a large in-house staff (true for
many institutional investors and most individual investors).
Soft-dollar consultants
Soft dollars are credits generated by brokerage commissions that money 
managers or investors can use to pay for a range of investment services. For
example, a brokerage firm may agree to give a money manager research
300
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

reports as long as the money manager generates $50,000 per year in commis-
sions. Otherwise, the money manager has to pay a hard-dollar fee of $25,000
(that is, the manager has to write a check on the firm’s account; see the previ-
ous section).
Legally, soft dollars belong to the person whose money is used to generate
the trade, not to the money manager. Many institutional investors, like uni-
versity endowments, ask the money manager to use soft dollars to pay for
consulting services that benefit the endowment fund itself. Instead of writing
a check, the money manager, under instruction from the endowment, directs
trades to a brokerage firm that in turn writes a check to the consultant.
The main problem with a soft-dollar setup is that the commissions may be
inflated, or the brokerage firm offering the arrangement may not have the
best traders. A second problem is that some folks try to use soft dollars for
everything, including rent on office space and leases on computers, even
when the use of soft dollars adds little or no value to the investment process.
That’s simply not appropriate and possibly illegal.
Just as you have soft dollars to spend on services, a hedge fund manager has
plenty of soft dollars to spend, too. Because hedge funds are lightly regulated
(by the SEC; see Chapter 3), the hedge fund manager has much more freedom
to spend soft dollars than a mutual fund or pension fund manager. This soft-
dollar propensity means that you, the hedge fund investor, may not be get-
ting the best possible return on your investment. If soft dollars enter into the
equation when you interview prospective consultants and funds, you need to
ask some tough questions of the consultants and spend some time monitor-
ing the situations.
Some consultants accept brokerage soft dollars in exchange for their services.
They may go this route through their own brokerage subsidiaries, or they may
have contracts with outside brokerage firms. For a large pension or endow-
ment fund that wants to make some investment decisions internally, using soft
dollars is one way to pay for services. After all, if the fund is trading, it’s gener-
ating commissions anyway, so why not put the commissions to use? As long
as the value of the services provided by the consultant is in line with the cost,
using soft dollars is a legitimate practice.
The United States Department of Labor has made it clear that for pension
funds regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1972
(ERISA), commissions generated belong to the plan beneficiaries. Unless the
value of the soft dollars will benefit the people who will receive the pension,
soft dollars are prohibited. Some other regulators have been following suit.
Before entering into a soft-dollar contract with a consultant or other service
provider, be sure that laws allow you to do so and that the service you
require is worth it. You’ll only know that if you do your research and know
what the hard-dollar price is for the services that you’re buying.
301
Chapter 17: Hiring a Consultant to Help You with Hedge Funds

Hedge Funds Pay the Consultants, Too
Many hedge funds need investors (good news for you, I hope!). The fund
managers need more money than they have to follow the investment strate-
gies that they’ve put in place. Because most funds charge an annual fee of a
few percent of their assets, a larger asset base means more revenue. Therefore,
in order to encourage consultants to recommend their hedge funds to clients,
some managers pay commissions. This may not be a bad thing if the fund you
choose is right for you. A problem occurs only when the consultant recom-
mends a less-than-ideal fund just to get his or her commission.
Some consultants reduce their fees by the amount of any commissions they
receive in order to minimize the conflict of interest on their end. But remem-
ber: If you’re making an investment decision on behalf of someone else —
say, the beneficiaries of a pension fund or trust account — you need to make
sure that you choose a fund because it’s the best overall, not because it
results in lower fees.
Hedge funds pay consultants for many different reasons, some of which may
create a conflict of interest for you:
 “Pay to play.” Some consultants get hard-dollar payments from hedge
funds and other money managers. They may not do this directly,
because that could be construed as extortion. Instead, they may accept
payments for performance reporting and analysis services, or they may
organize investment conferences and ask hedge fund managers to help
sponsor them.
 Shares in hedge funds. Instead of paying commissions, some hedge
fund managers give consultants and other investment advisors shares in
their funds in exchange for recommending them to others. These shares
have real value, especially if the funds go up! As with an outright cash
commission, though, giving out shares creates a conflict of interest for
the consultants. Just because a hedge fund offers this type of compensa-
tion doesn’t make it a bad fund, but it does mean that you as a client
need to watch out to make sure that your interests are met.

Doing Due Diligence

In This Chapter

I
f your mother says she loves you, check it out.” Harsh, maybe, but that
was the motto of Chicago’s now-defunct City News Bureau, a cooperative
news agency that spread reporters over the major news sources of the city.
The lesson for Bureau reporters was that no matter what a source told them,
they needed to find a way to verify their information. Due diligence was the
key, and it’s also the key to hedge funds.
Due diligence is the process of ensuring that a hedge fund is what it claims to
be. You and any lawyers, consultants, or accountants that you hire to assist
you perform a series of interviews, reference checks, and background checks
to ensure that the fund manager runs the fund well, that its investment style
meets your investment objectives (see Chapters 7 and 9), and that the people
working the fund have had few problems in their past. Doing due diligence is
in your best interest, and this chapter gives you information on how to go
about the process.

Why Do Due Diligence?
People often do business on trust. You’re pretty sure the realtor or car dealer
on the other side of the table is a straight shooter, and he or she is sure that
you are, too. Heck, most people are basically good, and you’ve always done
well with your other investments, so why not just write the check, sign the
papers, and be done with it? Why do you have to take the time to do due dili-
gence when everything is most likely on the up-and-up? Because sometimes,
people and business transactions are not on the up-and-up.
Face it: People lie. Every day, all the time. And people exaggerate just as fre-
quently. But that doesn’t make it right. What this means is that before you
commit your money to a hedge fund, you need to do some homework.
I’ve included the stories of some recent hedge-fund frauds in a sidebar in this
chapter, “Hedge fund horror stories.” Trust me, it’s scary stuff.
Hedge funds are private partnerships (see Chapter 2 for more about hedge
fund structure), and hedge fund managers don’t always have to report every-
thing that they do. Many investors, after looking at the stellar performances
that some funds have, don’t want to ask too many questions; they just want
to get a piece of the action.
I can give you many specific reasons to do your due diligence, like the following:
 Because it’s your money! The most important reason to do due dili-
gence is that you’re investing your money, the result of hard work and
calculated risk taking. If you feel that you can just sign your money away
to a hedge fund that you know little about . . . well, I hate to stop you,
but why would you do that? Part of being a good investor is asking ques-
tions and understanding what you’re doing. If you can’t handle the basic
responsibilities of investing, hedge funds just aren’t right for you. Hedge
funds are designed for sophisticated investors, and sophisticated
investors do their homework (see Chapter 1 for more on the basics of
hedge funds).
 Meeting fiduciary responsibilities. If you’re selecting hedge-fund invest-
ments for a pension, an endowment, or a trust, or you’re otherwise han-
dling someone else’s money, you have fiduciary responsibilities to
uphold. (See Chapter 8 for a detailed discussion of the requirements that
go with being in a fiduciary position.) You have to make sure that you
have a reasonable and adequate basis for your investment decisions. In
other words, you have to do your due diligence, documenting every step
you take.
304
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

In fiduciary positions, due diligence forms what’s known as an affirma-
tive defense against malpractice. If the pension or endowment’s beneficia-
ries decide to sue you because the hedge fund you chose turned out to
be a bad choice, you can show that you made the decision carefully and
that you knew as much as you could’ve known about the fund and the
people who ran it. What’s more, you’ll have the documentation to prove
it. A due-diligence report shows that you took your responsibilities seri-
ously and helps you avoid being found guilty of violating your fiduciary
duties.
Becoming Your Own Magnum, I.I.:
Investment Investigator
Because hedge funds are structured as partnerships (see Chapter 2), you
enter into a relatively intimate business relationship with the fund manager
when you buy into the fund. The better prepared you are, the better the rela-
tionship will be. If you do the work necessary to know that the fund manager
is who he says he is, you’ll have a greater level of trust. If you understand the
hedge fund manager’s attitudes about managing risk and generating return
(see Chapter 6), you’ll feel more comfortable with the results that the fund
posts. If you know who handles the fund’s cash, you can rest easier despite
having few opportunities to make withdrawals (see Chapter 7).
Likewise, the hedge fund manager should know that you’ll be doing your
research. He should expect it, in fact. Good hedge fund managers know that if
their partners do their homework, they’ll be happier with their investments.
Although a consultant may help you evaluate a fund manager (see Chapter
17), you still need to do your own due diligence. Fortunately, you have public
databases and other resources at your disposal to help you rule out man-
agers with a history of problems and to give you a better understanding of
how the managers run the hedge funds and how they’ll invest your money.
Don’t judge a hedge fund by its cover (or a fund manager by his or her suit).
Sure, successful people in the investment business have money to spend on
designer clothes, overpriced watches, and high-end interior design. But a
lavish style doesn’t always indicate success. Some investors enjoy success
because they’re cheap; they would no more buy new cars than pay a penny
over their buy prices on stocks. Others are absent-minded professor types
who care only for their elaborate new futures strategies, not whether their
socks match their suits. Still others go out and lease Hummers, buy expen-
sive suits on credit cards, and dodge phone calls from collections bureaus
that represent art galleries. A hedge fund manager may have the trappings of
success, but that doesn’t mean he’s successful. You have to do your research.
305
Chapter 18: Doing Due Diligence on a Hedge Fund

First things first: Knowing what to ask
One of the first steps in determining if a particular hedge fund makes sense
for you is to ask a lot of questions. After you assure the hedge fund manager
that you’re a serious investor (both accredited and able to invest in the fund
now; see Chapter 2), you’ll probably receive an offering document that
answers some of your questions — and raises others that don’t appear on
the list. No matter how thorough the offering document is, you’ll have to sit
down for an interview with the fund manager or submit a list of questions 
to the fund’s staff. And be sure to look for ways to verify the answers with
outside sources (I cover how to do this next) — this is part of your due 
diligence.
Here’s a list of questions to get you started. Your offering document will
cover some; some you’ll ask in an interview; and some you may have to find
answers to on your own. You probably want to get an answer for each one,
and you may well come up with other questions to ask.
 Investment strategy (see Chapters 10, 11, 12, and 13):
• What’s your investment objective? How do you achieve alpha (see
Chapter 6)?
• How did you construct your portfolio? How and why is it 
rebalanced?
• What’s your analysis and investment style? What would cause you
to deviate from your style?
• If you use computer models, do you ever override them? Do you
change the models?
• What’s the average number of positions your fund holds? How long
do you hold a typical position? What’s the level of portfolio
turnover?
• Do you use sub-advisors? (Sub-advisors are money managers who
handle a portion of the portfolio.) When and why? How do you
compensate them?
• Do you see yourself as a trader, an investor, or an analyst?
• Why is your fund different from others with the same investment
style? What edge do you have over other managers?
• Is your fund more suitable for taxable investors or for tax-exempt
ones (see Chapter 8)?
• How does your fund keep enough liquidity to meet allowed with-
drawals (see Chapter 7)?
306
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

 Performance (see Chapter 14):
• What have been your worst months? Your best months? Why?
• Did you earn your performance evenly in the past year, or did you
have one or two really good months? If so, what made those
months so good for your strategy?
• What was the time (the peak-to-trough range) between your best
month and your worst month?
• What holdings have worked out the best for you? Which one was
your worst ever? Why?
• Who calculates your fund’s returns? How often? Where does this
person get his/her data: from the prime broker or from the fund
manager?
• How do you value the portfolio? When do you price it? How do you
handle illiquid securities?
• Is your performance GIPS compliant? If not, why not? Do you
report your performance to Morningstar or other tracking 
services?
 Risk management (see Chapters 6 and 14):
• How does your fund use leverage (see Chapter 11)? What’s the
average leverage? What’s the maximum leverage allowed? How
often are you near those limits?
• Does your fund always have some leverage?
• Does your fund borrow from one bank or broker, or from several?
• What’s your maximum exposure to any one security? Any one
market? How often are you near those limits?
• How much of your borrowing is overnight? Short-term? Long-term?
How has that changed over time?
• How do you define risk? What’s your firm’s attitude toward risk?
• What risks have you identified? What are your strategies for man-
aging them?
• What happens if a trader exceeds his or her limits?
• What are your long-tail risk scenarios (see Chapter 6)?
• Do you use derivatives to hedge? To speculate?
• Do you try to profit from, or hedge against, interest-rate risk?
Currency risk? Market risk?
307
Chapter 18: Doing Due Diligence on a Hedge Fund

 Fund operations (see Chapter 2):
• Who are your fund’s founders? Are they still with you? If they’ve
left, why did they leave and where did they go?
• How do you compensate your traders? What’s the turnover of your
investment staff? Of your total staff?
• How much do the fund principals have invested in the fund? Is this
a good portion of their net worth?
• How do you keep the front and back office separated?
• Who is the asset custodian?
• What are your data-backup and disaster-recovery plans? How
quickly could you get back into business if your building shut
down?
• Who takes over if the fund manager is incapacitated or dies? What
is the key person risk?
• What are your data-security practices?
• Is the fund audited annually? If not, why not? If yours is a new fund,
have you lined up an auditor to do an audit at the end of the year?
• What’s your accounting firm? Your law firm? Your prime broker?
Your administrative-services firm?
 Compliance and transparency (see Chapters 3, 8, and 9):
• What are your compliance policies and procedures? May I see
them?
• Are you registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission?
With the Commodity Futures Trading Commission? Why or why
not?
• How much disclosure and reporting can I expect? How much trans-
parency should any hedge fund investor expect?
Interviewing the hedge fund manager
Getting to know the hedge fund manager on the other side of the table is a
good idea. When you talk to a fund manager, you get a sense of what it will be
like doing business with this person. Is she someone who will take your calls
and be patient with your questions? Does she seem to have the nerves to
handle volatile markets? Does her fund’s investment strategy require strong
nerves and a stronger stomach? Does she like to invest? Like to make money?
308
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

Like to spend money? You want to make sure that the fund fits your needs,
and that you’re comfortable with the fund’s strategy and the fund manager’s
personality.
The hedge fund manager probably won’t tell you everything. For example,
she probably won’t discuss the fund’s short positions (securities that the
fund borrows from others and then sells in hopes that they’ll go down in
price; see Chapter 11) or even its long positions. She should, however, tell
you about the following:
 How the fund goes about getting its return
 How she manages risk
 What types of securities she invests in
 How fund operations are handled
With this information, you’ll know if the fund’s investment strategies, risk-
and-return parameters, and administration situation are logical and if they fit
your investment needs.
Due diligence is as much about making sure that the hedge fund makes sense
for you as an investment as it is about checking up on the fund manager.
Poring over fund literature
After you arm yourself with the right questions, and hopefully get some
answers, your next step is to start checking up on the information you
receive. One way to do this is by reviewing the firm’s literature. A hedge fund
manager will give a prospective investor thick legal documents after he or
she is satisfied that the investor is accredited and serious about investing in
the fund now. The documents lay out the investment policies that govern the
fund and its operations. The hedge fund manager may also hand accredited
and interested prospective investors glossy decks of PowerPoint slides or
other sales materials that explain the fund’s investment policies and opera-
tions with less “legalese.”
The information in these legal documents and glossy marketing materials
includes the fund’s investment strategy and fees as well as biographical infor-
mation on the people who run the fund. You can use these resources to make
a list of information you want to verify elsewhere and to come up with ques-
tions that you still consider unanswered.
309
Chapter 18: Doing Due Diligence on a Hedge Fund

Picking up the phone
Another important step in the due-diligence process is to call former em-
ployers of the fund you’re interested in and others to verify the information
you’ve received through interviews and literature and that appears on the
hedge fund manager’s résumé.
The fund manager should give you reference names and contact information
for the resources you want to investigate. Even if the list has a former
employee’s or current investor’s direct line or personal cell phone, you
should go through the organization’s main switchboard and ask to be con-
nected. In the unlikely event that a fraud is hot on your trail, you can catch it
faster this way. Sometimes, criminals hire an accomplice and give the person
a cell phone and a script to use when the phone rings. You’re doing due dili-
gence to catch an unlikely but devastating fraud.
Here’s a list of people you should call:
 Former employees. They may restrict their details to only dates of hire
and positions held, but that information is useful — especially if it doesn’t
match with what the hedge fund manager tells you. If you can talk to a
former fund colleague in depth, consider asking about the following
topics:
• How the fund manager researched and made trades
• How the manager worked with others on staff
• How the manager worked with clients
• How the fund manager affected the performance at his old position
at his old firm
 Universities and colleges. Be sure to call the colleges listed on the
hedge fund manager’s résumé. Many folks have an unfortunate habit of
lying about their educational backgrounds, so you should verify the
degrees that the hedge fund manager claims from the schools that he
says he attended. Many Wall Streeters have taken night-school classes
through Harvard University’s extension program and promoted them to
MBAs at Harvard Business School at their own discretion.
 Associated firms. While you’re smiling and dialing, be sure to call the
law firm that the hedge fund lists as its counsel, as well as the hedge
fund’s accounting firm, prime broker, and administrative-services firm.
You want to make sure that these firms are providing the services that
the manager says they do, and you want to make sure that the relation-
ships are good ones. After all, you’ll be dealing with these people, too.
(Read the rest of this chapter and Chapter 2 for more information.)
310
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

 Current investors. You may also be able to talk to current investors in
the hedge fund. If so, you should ask them for the following information:
• Why they chose this fund
• If the fund’s performance has met their expectations
• What type of communication they’ve received from the hedge fund
manager
Don’t be impressed by famous names or affiliations. You want to find out
about the fund’s operations, not the celebrities in the fund manager’s
social circuit.
Searching Internet databases
An easy due-diligence step is to see if the folks in charge of the hedge fund
are who they say they are. One way to find out is to do some simple Internet
searches and look beyond the first pages of results you see. Most likely, your
search will turn up nothing interesting, but that’s the point (I hope). A basic
Web search can also help you grow comfortable with a fund manager by
showing you the following (be on the lookout for these):
 Articles that the fund manager may have written
 Speeches that he/she may have given
 News stories about him/her that give you more information about the
fund manager’s investment philosophy
Internet databases sometimes have incorrect information, and they can be
thrown off if the person that you’re looking for has a common name or rela-
tives who share the same name. Consider any information that you find to be
a point for further questioning and research, not an automatic reason to
accept or reject the fund. Also, some of the sites that show up may be prod-
ucts of the hedge fund manager herself; what you want are sites that objec-
tive outsiders have prepared.
Here are some recommended database sites:
 Pretrieve (www.pretrieve.com): Offers free searches of property
records, court records, and other databases. You can see if the hedge
fund’s principals have had run-ins with regulators before. Pretrieve isn’t
as powerful as LexisNexis, but it’s a good first stop.
 LexisNexis (www.lexisnexis.com): A huge database of court records,
public records, and news stories. Law firms rely on it heavily because it
includes more information than any free service. Unlimited access is
expensive, but an a la carte service allows you to search for free and
then buy the documents you need at about $3.00 each.

 NASD BrokerCheck (The National Association of Securities Dealers;
www.nasdbrokercheck.com): Has an online service that lets investors
check on brokers. Many people in the securities industry hold brokers’
licenses, not just folks holding sales jobs. Some hedge fund managers
may be registered with the NASD now, or they may have been in earlier
jobs. You can find the employment and disciplinary history of managers
who are registered at this site.
 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC; www.sec.gov): Many
hedge funds are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, so you can do research on the funds through the commis-
sion’s Web site. You can also search for enforcement records
(www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce.shtml) to see if a registered
fund has had problems or to find out if the fund manager ran into trou-
ble while at another job.
 National Futures Association (www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet):
Many hedge funds are registered as commodities trading accounts,
which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees. The
National Futures Association maintains a database of people and funds
registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and you
can look up information about the people and funds at the Web site I 
list here.
Given the amount of academic research that goes into finance and that hedge
fund managers have absorbed, you may think that academic research can
help you with your due diligence. Although many professors are researching
hedge funds, and university research centers are set up to look into the
market, almost all of them concentrate on historical prices. Their studies can
tell you if reported macro-fund alpha was predominantly positive or negative
from 2000 to 2005, for example, but they can’t tell you if sharp people who
will generate a positive return this year run a given fund.
Seeking help from service providers
Many hedge funds are small organizations, showing that a small number of
people can manage a lot of money! However, most hedge funds rely heavily
on outside service organizations, and you should check out these firms as
part of your due diligence. The following list breaks down the firms that
should be on your list:
 The prime broker: The brokerage firm that handles most of the securi-
ties trades that the fund makes. The prime broker may also handle
administrative services, such as taking in new investments, dispersing
any funds withdrawn, and sending out periodic statements (a dedicated
administrative-services provider can also handle these functions).
312
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

The folks who actually handle the fund’s cash, taking in investments and
disbursing withdrawals, should be part of an outside organization. So
many great administrative-services firms work with hedge funds that a
fund doesn’t need to manage money on its own, nor should it try.
Consider it a red flag if the hedge fund you’re investigating does its own
administrative work, even if the fund is part of a brand-name broker, and
especially if it isn’t. At a minimum, separate legal subsidiaries that have
guidelines to ensure that transactions happen at arm’s length should
provide the fund’s administrative services.
 A law firm: Assists with the fund’s regulatory compliance activities;
even an unregistered fund has laws that govern its activities (see
Chapter 3).
 An accounting firm: Assists with the fund’s valuation of assets, calcula-
tion of returns, and preparation of tax forms.
 Sub-advisors: Manage certain types of assets.
 An actuary or other risk-management consultant: Helps the fund calcu-
late the risk it takes.
You, the prospective hedge fund investor, should know who the people in
these firms are and what they do. The hedge fund manager should give you a
list of the fund’s service providers, and you should call at least a few to verify
the services provided.
More assistance with due diligence
If you represent a pension or endowment firm, you probably won’t want to do
all the due-diligence work on your own. You may have a lawyer or investment
consultant (see Chapter 17) shoulder much of the legwork. If another person
is checking on a fund, make sure you see the checklist that the person is
using (see the previous sections of this chapter). And make sure to ask for a
report that shows the findings of your aide’s investigation, as well as any
questions that remain unanswered.
If you’re committing large dollars to a relatively unknown entity on your own,
you may want to hire a private investigator to do some due diligence. This
tactic isn’t unheard of. Remember, many outstanding hedge fund managers
prefer to stay out of the limelight, so it may be difficult to do research on
them.
One good reason to invest in a fund of funds, an investment pool that invests
in several hedge funds (see Chapter 15), is because the fund of funds orga-
nizer does the due diligence for you. However, you should still make sure that
due diligence has taken place. Ask to see the organizer’s reports, and ask
about the methods he or she used to research the funds chosen.
313
Chapter 18: Doing Due Diligence on a Hedge Fund

What Are You Gonna Do When the
Hedge Fund Does Due Diligence on YOU!
Hedge funds can’t take money from anyone off the street (even if it is Wall
Street); they can deal only with accredited investors, or people who have at
least $1 million in assets or an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 with a
spouse; see Chapter 2). Securities laws also require that hedge funds ensure
that their investment options are suitable for their investors (see Chapter 3).
Hedge funds operate on what’s sometimes called the Know Your Customer
rule. The fund needs to verify that you’re accredited, possibly by seeing any
of the following:
 Account statements
 Pay stubs
 Past tax returns
The fund manager should also ensure that the fund is suitable for your
investment goals (see Chapters 7 and 9); just because you’re accredited 
doesn’t mean an investment is right for you.
Because of Federal anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws, a hedge
fund manager may want to verify that you are who you say you are and that
the money for your investment came from a legitimate source. If you don’t
like it, complain to your elected officials, not to the fund manager.
The fund manager may ask for certification of your accredited status before
anyone on staff will talk to you. You may not need to show other information
until you write the check to make the investment. And, truth be told, some
smaller hedge funds don’t do the work on their customers, so they may never
ask you for anything but your cash.
Knowing the Limits of Due Diligence
Due diligence is a necessary process that helps you better understand the
investment you’re making and its ability to assist you in meeting your invest-
ment goals. The process may even stop you from investing with a fund man-
ager who has a history of trouble with investors or who’s perpetrating a
fraud.
314
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 

But due diligence has its limits. Good people go bad. Bad people sometimes
hide problems for a while and then run out of ways to cover them up. One of
the hallmarks of a really good fraud is that it has a strong foundation that
stays hidden for a long time. Due diligence reduces the likelihood of fraud
and gives you a defense for your fiduciary duties if a fraud occurs (see the
section “Why Do Due Diligence?”), but it can’t prevent every problem.
You should review your due diligence work on a regular basis to discover
information that a manager may hide and to stay up to speed on current
events. For example, a fund manager may not tell you about sanctions by the
Securities and Exchange Commission or the National Association of Securities
Dealers, even though this information is public information. An easy way to
keep tabs on breaking events is by setting up a personalized news section on
the Google News Web page (news.google.com) or by subscribing to
Google’s Alerts (www.google.com/alerts), both of which are free.
A hedge fund and its manager may check out, but that doesn’t mean you’ll
make money. You can find plenty of honest ways to lose vast fortunes, and
past performance is no assurance of future results. Keep this info in mind
when you write a check.
315
Chapter 18: Doing Due Diligence on a Hedge Fund
Hedge fund horror stories
Here’s the bottom line: Hedge fund managers
tend to be secretive about the specifics of their
trades, and hedge funds don’t have to register
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (see Chapter 3). Many investors
are so blinded by greed that they don’t ask the
tough questions. And what can result from this
negligence? Outright fraud. It doesn’t happen
often, but it does happen. Here are some recent
spectacular cases of fraud:
 Bayou Management. Bayou Management
operated a series of hedge funds that took
in a total of $450 million from investors after
the firm’s inception in 1996. It seems that
Bayou started as a legitimate business, but
the fund had some big losses starting in
1997. The Securities and Exchange
Commission alleges that rather than admit
the losses to investors, the fund’s managers
made up performance numbers and then
used the receipts from new investors to
meet withdrawal requests. It also seems
that the managers pursued some extremely
risky investments in hopes of making up the
funds, but these risks caused them to lose
more money. In the meantime, the fund’s
executives collected commissions from
trades and took incentive payments based
on allegedly phony performance.
Among the warning signs of potential prob-
lems was that Samuel Israel III, the founder
of the fund, claimed to have been the head
trader at Omega Advisors, a successful
New York hedge fund, when he actually
worked as an order taker. Bayou also oper-
ated its own brokerage firm, which made it
easier to conceal wrongdoing than if it had
used an outside broker to handle its trades.

316
Part IV: Special Considerations Regarding Hedge Funds 
 GLT Venture Fund. Keith Gilabert, who oper-
ated the Capital Management Group
Holding Company — which managed a
hedge fund, the GLT Venture Fund — raised
$14.1 million from 38 investors beginning in
September of 2001. The fund posted losses
almost from the beginning, but it reported
gains to its investors. Gilabert charged his
management fees based on the phony prof-
its, and he received commission kickbacks
from one of the brokers with whom he did
business. When investors made with-
drawals, they received money from new
investors coming in, not from the fund’s
assets. Federal agents also have evidence
that Gilabert mass-marketed the fund, a vio-
lation of the rules requiring unregistered
funds to deal only with accredited investors
(see Chapter 2).
Due diligence could have uncovered two
warning signs: The fund wasn’t formed until
2000, but it claimed performance dating
back to 1997, and in 2003, the California
Department of Corporations revoked
Gilabert’s investment adviser registration.
 International Management Associates. In
February 2006, a group of current and
former NFL players filed suit against a
hedge fund that they invested in, accusing
the general partners of stealing their
money. The Securities and Exchange
Commission filed its own suit shortly there-
after. The firm involved was International
Management Associates, which ran seven
hedge funds but hadn’t verified or audited
its returns for two years. The manager, Kirk
Wright, had taken in $185 million from more
than 500 investors beginning in 1997. He lost
money during much of that time period but
sent investors statements showing big
gains.
Due diligence could’ve shown several hints
of trouble. First, the firm had no auditor.
Second, instead of using a prime broker that
specialized in work for hedge funds, the
fund kept its accounts at E*Trade,
AmeriTrade, and other online brokerage
firms that usually deal with individual
investors. Finally, the fund’s COO and CFO
were both anesthesiologists. Doctors are
smart people, but medical school isn’t ade-
quate training for investment jobs.
 KL Group. KL Group started a series of
hedge funds in 1999. Between 1999 and
2005, the fund managers collected $81 mil-
lion in assets from investors and lost all but
$11 million of that to trading losses and
management fees. However, the fund
reported incredible returns of over 125 per-
cent a year. In early 2005, investors trying to
withdraw found out that all their money was
gone and that two of the fund’s managers,
Won Sok Lee and Yung Bae Kim, had fled
the country. The third manager, John Lee,
cooperated with investigators.
Three things could’ve tipped off potential
investors. The first is that KL Group’s princi-
pals refused to discuss the fund’s strategy,
holdings, or risk levels, arguing that they
were entirely proprietary. You’re entitled to
some information about what’s going on in a
fund and what kind of risk the fund has.
Second, a 125-percent return isn’t sustain-
able over the long run; it’s possible to make
that much money, but only with large risks.
That fabulous claim alone should’ve raised
some questions, especially because the
managers made the claim back to 1997 for a
fund that didn’t begin operations until 1999.
Finally, the fund made trades through an in-
house brokerage firm, Shoreland Trading —
simply not a good practice. Hedge funds
should use outside brokers.

Chapter 18: Doing Due Diligence on a Hedge Fund
 Wood River Capital Management. In
October 2005, Lehman Brothers, a major
investment banking and prime brokerage
firm, sued Wood River Capital Management,
a hedge fund that claimed to have a diver-
sified investment style. The fund owed
Lehman $20 million. It turns out that 68 per-
cent of the fund’s assets sat in a single
stock, EndWave Communications, which
declined in price. This went against Wood
River’s 
marketing 
materials, 
which
promised investors that the fund would hold
a variety of securities. Also, the fund’s man-
agement had never filed statements with
the Securities and Exchange Commission
showing that it owned 45 percent of
EndWave. Any shareholder with more than
a 5-percent stake in a company must notify
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Wood River’s investors had two warning
signs that should’ve sent off bells and whis-
tles. The first was that in 2002, the landlord
of Wood River’s San Francisco office sued
the company for non-payment of rent. The
second is that the fund’s executives never
presented audited financial statements,
despite saying that they would — and
despite that being a good practice. Wood
River claimed in its offering memorandum
that its audit firm was American Express
Tax and Business Services. A phone call to
that company would’ve revealed that it
doesn’t provide business-audit services for
hedge funds or anyone else.

H
edge funds are big, glamorous, secretive, moneymaking machines.
These are the facts! Unfortunately, myths fuel the media headlines, 
the market commentaries, and the rumors as much as reality. So, before you
invest your money in a big and glamorous hedge fund, a little skepticism is in
order. This chapter helps by covering myths that you’re most likely to hear.
A Hedge Fund Is Like a Mutual 
Fund with Better Returns
A hedge fund is an investment partnership with relatively little regulatory
oversight that can invest in a wide range of assets and follow a wide range of
aggressive strategies. A mutual fund, on the other hand, is a heavily regulated
public company that can’t invest in some assets or pursue some trading
strategies.
“Sign me up!” is what the hedge funds want you to say after reading these
descriptions. Not so fast. The flip side of the coin is that hedge funds can lose
money. Many post mediocre performances, especially after you take the fees
into consideration (see Chapters 2 and 4). On the other hand, some mutual
funds have great performances with relatively low fees. Just because an
investment is structured as a hedge fund doesn’t mean its performance is any
good.

Hedge funds are great investments for investors who have a lot of money 
and who need the risk and return benefits that hedge funds offer. Because 
a hedge fund has a very different structure than a mutual fund, an average
investor may have a difficult time getting into one, regardless of the perfor-
mance. It’s like the difference between a private club and the YMCA. You may
not be able to get into the private club or afford its membership fees, but you
can still get a great workout and meet plenty of interesting people at the Y.
Hedge Funds Are Asset Classes That
Should Be in Diversified Portfolios
Hedge funds are not asset classes. That is, they’re not distinct securities with
distinct risk and return profiles. (You can read more about asset classes in
Chapter 5.) A hedge fund is a lightly regulated private investment partner-
ship. The hedge fund’s manager probably charges a management fee of 2 
percent of the assets, as well as a performance bonus of 20 percent of the
profits. Saying that you want to diversify into hedge funds may be like saying,
“I’m tired of shopping at stores with a 100-percent markup; I want to start
shopping at places with a 150-percent markup.”
Now, among the thousands of private investment partnerships that charge
the 2 and 20 combination (a 2 percent or more management fee and a 20 per-
cent performance bonus) are some that may fit your investment objectives
and help you diversify your overall portfolio (see Chapters 7 and 9 to find out
more about these goals). But these benefits aren’t results of the fund struc-
ture; they come from the fund manager’s skill and choice of assets. Look for
these two characteristics when searching for a suitable hedge fund.
Alpha Is Real and Easy to Find
Ask a hedge fund manager how she plans to earn her fees, and she’ll start
raving about alpha like a sorority or fraternity member. Managers draw the
term from the Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM), an academic attempt 
to explain how securities are valued (see Chapter 6). Alpha is performance
added from the portfolio manager’s skills (in other words, the performance
that the manager adds or subtracts from her intellectual ability, her ability to
time the market and make decisions, and her ability to come up with new
investing strategies). Each hedge fund has its own way of achieving alpha,
and fund managers love to talk about it.
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

In theory, alpha is zero. The market is so huge and so efficient that no fund
can get a consistent advantage over it. If alpha does exist, it can be positive
or negative. In other words, the fund manager could be subtracting value
from the fund. Yowsa!
The fact is positive alpha isn’t as common as most hedge fund investors
would like to think. I’m not saying it doesn’t exist, or that some fund managers
haven’t figured out a way to beat the market consistently. Just remember:
Anyone who has really figured out alpha isn’t getting up and going to work
every day.
A Fund That Identifies an Exotic and
Effective Strategy Is Set Forever
Assuming that some kind of alpha does exist (see the previous section), and
that a hedge fund manager finds a way to get it, will the great excess perfor-
mance of the fund last? Probably not.
Markets may not be perfectly efficient, but they’re close (sounds like a bad
sales pitch for an air conditioner, right?). Thousands of traders all over the
world are connected to electronic information networks. They work for
hedge funds, brokerage firms, mutual-fund companies, and other financial
institutions. And while these pros are connected, they’re looking to make
money from aberrations in prices and patterns. One trader may find an
unusual strategy that makes a ton of money. Eventually, other traders will
notice the strategy and try the same thing. Either that, or market conditions
will fluctuate, regulations will change, or economies will move, making the
strategy obsolete.
As much as hedge fund managers and investors want to believe that alpha
can be achieved, thrive, and generate consistent profits, the success is proba-
bly a short-term opportunity. Good fund managers know this and adapt to
changing markets.
Hedge Funds Are Risky
Hedge fund traders, the people who trade securities for hedge funds, are go-
go people. They make crazy trades in exotic securities; they often drive fancy
cars; and they have mouths that need washed out with soap. Their goal is to
get extra return so that they can collect their bonuses. When they succeed,
323
Chapter 19: Ten (Plus One) Big Myths about Hedge Funds

they sometimes tick off people on the other side of the trade — people
including national leaders, corporate executives, and stock-exchange offi-
cials. These unhappy folks badmouth hedge funds and leave the casual
observer with the idea that hedge funds are wild and crazy investments.
Some managers run hedge funds to maximize investment return relative to
market performance, but others design funds to generate returns within a
narrow band — say 7 percent to 9 percent — by eliminating market risk (see
Chapter 6 for more on returns). The traders on these funds may be just as
crazy, but they trade to insure their funds’ returns to capture big profits.
Hedge Funds Hedge Risk
Not all hedge funds are risky, but not all hedge funds hedge, either. You can’t
make the assumption that an investment partnership called a “hedge fund”
actually hedges. The first fund, set up by Alfred Winslow Jones (see Chapter 1),
was a private partnership that charged a management fee and a 20-percent
bonus paid out of performance. It also hedged risk by buying securities it
expected to go up and selling short shares it expected to go down (see
Chapter 11). In other words, Jones had a unique business structure and a
unique investment strategy in his hedge fund. Nowadays, investment partner-
ships that call themselves “hedge funds” keep the business structure but not
necessarily the hedging strategy.
Recently, I heard of a manager who claims that he’s running a hedge fund. 
His strategy? Borrowing plenty of money and using it to buy shares in the 10
largest technology companies. If technology performs well, he’ll make a for-
tune for himself and his investors. If tech stocks go down, though, he still has
to repay his loans, which will magnify his losses. His strategy carries astro-
nomical risk without hedging in any sense of the word.
The Hedge-Fund Industry Is 
Secretive and Mysterious
Hedge fund managers often shun the press, have unlisted phone numbers,
and refuse to send out information to potential investors. Because these 
managers don’t talk, they leave the outside world to assume that they have
almost magical ways of making money that they can’t discuss or disclose to
the uninitiated.
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The reality is this: In exchange for their relatively light regulation, hedge
funds agree to market only to accredited investors, which are people who
have at least $1 million in assets or who earn at least $200,000 per year
($300,000 with a spouse; see Chapters 1 and 2). Any activity that resembles
marketing to unaccredited investors could bring a fund major trouble with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, whether or not the fund is reg-
istered (see Chapter 3).
Now, if you are an accredited investor, a hedge fund manager who’s looking
for new investors should talk to you, answer your questions, and be able to
explain the fund’s investment strategy. You don’t have to pledge allegiance,
prick your finger, or learn secret passwords; you just have to invest money!
(See Chapter 8 for more on transparency.)
The Hedge-Fund Industry 
Loves Exotic Securities
In their quest for alpha (see Chapter 6) and in their desire for big profits,
hedge fund managers often invest in offbeat securities that most investors
won’t touch. But not all hedge funds follow this strategy. Many invest in 
traditional assets, like common stocks of large companies and U.S. treasury
bonds — the same assets that an average mutual fund or average trust fund
will focus on. The fund managers may trade differently, especially because
you can’t make withdrawals at any time (see Chapter 7), but the securities
involved are often quite ordinary.
Hedge Funds Are Sure-Fire 
Ways to Make Money
Many investors want to get into hedge funds because they think they can
make big bucks. Many money managers want to start hedge funds for the
same reason. The idea of a flexible investment policy that can profit from
markets, whether they go up or down, is mighty appealing to investors who
want returns and fund managers who want to collect annual bonuses.
The stark reality is that many hedge funds don’t perform well. You don’t hear
about these funds, because hedge funds don’t have to report their results.
And when a fund does perform well, the fund manager’s cut of the profits
may bring the returns down to the same levels that mutual fund investors
receive.
325
Chapter 19: Ten (Plus One) Big Myths about Hedge Funds

Hedge funds are like any other type of investment: Some do well, and some
don’t. The label of the investment has nothing to do with its performance.
Hedge Funds Are Only 
for the “Big Guys”
Hedge funds are open only to accredited investors — people who have $1
million in assets or who earn at least $200,000 per year ($300,000 with a
spouse; see Chapters 1 and 2). That’s a big nut! But that requirement doesn’t
have to leave you out in the cold if you’re a smaller investor. You can learn a
trick or two from hedge fund managers:
 You can look into funds of funds, which have lower investor requirements
that allow smaller investors to buy into a portfolio of several hedge funds
(see Chapter 15).
 You can join mutual funds that sell stocks short to benefit from down
markets, just as traditional hedge funds do (see Chapters 15 and 16).
 You can carefully diversify your current investment portfolio to take
advantage of natural hedges that can increase return for a given level 
of risk — and you don’t have to give up 20 percent of your profits (see
Chapter 16)!
All Hedge Fund Managers Are Brilliant
Many hedge fund managers have PhDs in finance or physics, have top grades
from top schools, and can solve even the toughest Sudoku puzzles in min-
utes. But that doesn’t mean that all hedge fund managers are brilliant. Some
developed a reputation for being good investors because they had one or two
really good years (the result of luck); others are very good at promoting their
funds, creating an aura of success even though their skills are mediocre.

in a Hedge Fund

 Using hedge funds to reduce risk and increase return
 Taking advantage of market conditions
 Diversifying your portfolio and expanding your assets
 Aligning yourself with smart and like-minded fund managers
S
ome hedge funds live up to the hype you’ve undoubtedly heard by gener-
ating great returns to help investors meet their investment objectives.
Unlike in Chapter 21, I’m here to present 10 really good reasons for you to
consider hedge funds for your portfolio. Want one right off the bat? Hedge
funds can reduce risk and increase return, and the fund manager doesn’t get
paid unless he or she makes money for you. Talk about eliminating a conflict
of interest! Without further ado, let me show you want funds can do. This
chapter explores how hedge funds live up to the hype and why you should
consider them.
Helping You Reduce Risk
In their purest forms, hedge funds are about reducing risk. In investing, a
hedge is a form of insurance against an asset price decline. A hedge fund 
is structured to reduce the risk of the portfolio without sacrificing return.
Financial research has shown that investment return is closely related to the
risk that an investor takes. For example, in a traditional stock investment
(see Chapter 5), the investor takes on the risk of the stock market. The 
more risk the investor is willing to accept, the greater his or her potential 
for return (and for loss). But by matching that investor’s market investment
with offsetting futures positions (see Chapter 5), a hedge fund can remove
the market risk and isolate only the extra performance.

Because hedge funds generally have high minimum investments, they appeal
most to high-net-worth individuals and to larger pension and endowment
funds. In most cases, a hedge fund investor has other investments outside of
the fund that carry market risk. The different risk-and-return profile of the
hedge fund can offset the risk in the other investments, making the investor,
as a whole, better off.
Helping You Weather Market Conditions
Markets change as quickly as the weather in Chicago. Political turmoil, nat-
ural disasters, and economic upheaval, for example, all are reflected in the
daily machinations of stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities. Hedge
funds are set up to work through this upheaval for two reasons:
 They have access to a wide array of risk-management techniques that
can help limit the effects of market downturns.
 They have less oversight and more freedom in their operations, which
allows them to move quickly to profit from the wild swings in markets.
If you want to learn more about hedge funds and what they do, read Chapter 1.
Better yet, read the rest of this book! A mutual fund manager, by contrast,
would be held to the investment strategy in the prospectus, which is the offer-
ing document that it must make available to all potential investors, and would
probably have to sit through hours of investment committee meetings to make
any major structural changes in the portfolio. A hedge fund manager simply
makes a trade when the time is right.
Increasing Your Total Diversification
Diversifying your portfolio is an easy way of hedging. Buy one stock, and 
you’re stuck if it goes down in price. Buy two, and you can be confident that
both won’t go down at the same time. Buy three, and the risk of all three going
down together is even smaller. Add some bonds, and the risk of your total port-
folio crashing and burning is smaller still. Each of these aforementioned invest-
ments has a slightly different risk-and-return profile (see Chapters 5 and 6).
A hedge fund increases the amount of diversification in a portfolio because it
has a different risk-and-return profile than other investments you may have.
A fund also has more freedom to invest in other types of assets. A good hedge
fund manager stays plugged into the market, maintaining access to currency
swaps, commodity pools, private offerings, and other types of investments
that may be hard to own otherwise. A hedge fund manager can generally use
investments and investment techniques that would be impossible for individ-
uals to try.
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Increasing Your Absolute Return
If you remove market risk, which is the goal of many hedge funds, you still
need some return, which is why hedge fund managers look for investments
that can bring them alpha. In their search, they may find offbeat investments
that can generate a greater return than what they have available from other
types of investments. In financial theory, alpha is the excess return to an
investment, a return that market performance can’t explain (see Chapter 6).
Performance is a simple equation:
Exposure to Market Return + Alpha = Total Performance
A stock market index fund has no alpha, because it buys all the stocks in an
index in the same proportion to achieve the same performance. The return
on investment is pure market, with no addition or subtraction for the man-
ager’s skill (or lack thereof).
Hedge funds also increase potential return by using leverage. In other words,
they can borrow money to take greater positions in their investments (see
Chapter 11). If you own a house, for example, you probably used leverage in
the purchasing process. Say you put $50,000 down on a $250,000 house — a
20-percent down payment. You take a $200,000 mortgage at 5-percent inter-
est. In a year, the house appreciates 10 percent to $275,000, and your gain 
on the $50,000 down payment is even greater. If you subtract the $10,000 or
so that you paid in interest that year, your gain is $15,000 — a 30-percent
increase.
A hedge fund uses the same process. Because a fund can borrow money in
ways that other types of investments can’t, it can look for an asset with a rel-
atively low return and relatively little risk that can become an asset that
offers a much higher return.
Increasing Returns for 
Tax-Exempt Investors
Hedge fund managers often invest without concern for the tax implications of
its investment positions. That’s perfectly fine for major hedge fund investors,
because they don’t pay taxes. These tax-exempt investors are pension funds,
university and institutional endowments, and charitable foundations. For
them, the aggressive and offbeat investment techniques that some hedge
funds use are a perfect fit, because they don’t have to worry about the
friendly revenue collector taking the profits away.

Chapter 20: Ten Good Reasons to Invest in a Hedge Fund

If you’re working for a large tax-exempt investor, it makes sense for you to inves-
tigate hedge funds as a way to increase your portfolio’s overall rate of return.
(See Chapter 8 for more on tax considerations and fiduciary responsibility.)
Helping Smooth Out Returns
With its emphasis on risk reduction, a hedge fund may offer a more pre-
dictable investment performance. A fund may not go up as much as the 
stock market during a year when the market is unusually strong, but the 
fund shouldn’t perform as badly as the market during years when the 
market isn’t so hot. This baseline may make returns more predictable.
Predictability is especially important to pensions and endowments. Pension
funds have to pay out money to retirees every month, so the fund administra-
tors need to know that the money is available. Endowments generate income
to fund the operations of charities or educational institutions, and the benefi-
ciaries want some assurance that money will be there to pay the bills. No stu-
dent wants to lose his scholarship because his endowment lost money during
the year. (See Chapter 8 for more on fiduciary responsibility.)
An investment in fixed-income securities, like U.S. government bonds, gener-
ates a predictable return, albeit a relatively low return. Therefore, such an
investment won’t help a pension reduce its ongoing funding costs, and it
won’t help with the expansion of a charity or college. Many hedge funds can
offer increased predictability at higher rates of return.
Giving You Access to Broad 
Asset Categories
Most investment pools have specific investment objectives and specific lists
of investments. They invest in only certain types of assets, and they have reg-
ular reviews. A portfolio manager may set asset classes in a prospectus or
other offering document, so the manager can’t make a change without having
a regulatory compliance problem. In addition, outside consultants may be on
hand to carefully scrutinize the portfolio manager, looking with suspicion for
changes in investment style.
Hedge funds have a broader charter. The fund manager doesn’t need
approval to try a new investment strategy. She doesn’t have to report to fund
investors daily, weekly, or even monthly, so she doesn’t have to worry about
how an investment will look on some report card (see Chapters 8 and 9 for
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

more on transparency). Private equity deals, complicated currency hedges,
and strange commodity plays all have time to work, free of the messy over-
sight of people who aren’t intimate with the market’s machinations (see
Chapter 5 for more information on different types of assets).
Exploiting Market Inefficiencies Quickly
Hedge funds have the ability to move quickly in changing markets. If a fund
manager sees an investment opportunity but doesn’t have the necessary
cash on hand to make a transaction, he can borrow money from a bank, a
brokerage firm, or even a loan shark to make the purchase (see Chapter 11).
Few other types of investments have the power to use leverage the way that
hedge funds do.
Hedge funds are also free to sell short. In other words, a fund can borrow an
asset, sell it in hopes that it goes down in price, and then buy it back at the
lower price to repay the original loan, pocketing the difference. The ability to
sell short increases the opportunities to make money, even in a down market.
Few other investment managers have the same freedom and the expertise to
sell short. (See Chapter 11 for more info on short-selling.)
Another opportunity for hedge funds is merger and acquisition financing. 
The private-partnership structure limits the number of people who have to
approve a capital commitment. A hedge fund can move quickly to make
money on even a small difference between the market price of a company’s
bonds and the price that an acquirer is willing to pay. By the time other
investors see the price discrepancy and put themselves in a position to act,
the opportunity may be gone. (See Chapter 12 for more information on corpo-
rate considerations.)
Fund Managers Tend to Be the Savviest
Investors on the Street
Allow me to give you some insight on the characteristics of a hedge fund
manager. Hedge fund managers
 Tend to be really smart
 Are passionate about investing
 Care about making money, period
331
Chapter 20: Ten Good Reasons to Invest in a Hedge Fund

Making you (and themselves, of course) money is their drive, meaning they
don’t show interest in
 Sales and marketing
 Management
 The niceties of business etiquette
Want to make a fund manager happy? Put him in front of a quote machine.
Many of the brightest people on Wall Street run hedge funds. A good portion
of them have PhDs in math or have spent time as actuaries. Fund managers
don’t want to deal with the overhead and the business obligations of a larger
organization. When you invest in a hedge fund, you’re more likely to have a
sharp manager than if you choose another vehicle for your money.
Of course, brainpower is no guarantee of great results. Long-Term Capital
Management had two Nobel Prize–winning economists among its general
partners (see Chapter 1 for more on this fund). But smarts are a good start!
Incentives for Hedge Fund Managers 
Are Aligned with Your Needs
Investing in a hedge fund is a great way to ensure that your interests are
taken as seriously as the fund manager’s. Hedge fund managers eat what they
kill, as the saying goes. Although they take a hefty cut of the fund’s profits,
usually 20 percent, they receive that money only if the fund sees profits. If the
fund has a losing year, a fund manager can’t collect a performance fee until
the fund gets back to the level it enjoyed before the losses occurred, a level
called the high water mark. This requirement gives the fund manager a huge
incentive to make money for his or her investors. A mutual fund manager, by
contrast, takes home a nice salary even if the fund’s performance is poor.
In addition to adhering to the pay-for-performance policy, hedge fund managers
often manage money for themselves and their families. Talk about pressure!
