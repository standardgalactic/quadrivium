Ubuntu OpenStack brings together the 
work of the OpenStack community and that 
of global software vendor Canonical, the 
company behind Ubuntu, the leader in cloud 
and scale out technologies. At Canonical, we 
have been contributing to the OpenStack 
project since the very beginning. Today, 
Ubuntu and OpenStack are inextricably 
linked. They even share a release cycle. 
In recent years, Ubuntu OpenStack has 
become the undisputed platform of choice 
for OpenStack users, with 55% of OpenStack 
deployments taking place on Ubuntu, and 7 out 
of 8 OpenStack ‘super-users’ choosing Ubuntu, 
according to the OpenStack Foundation.
Today, there’s no more reliable, scalable 
or easily managed route to a carrier-grade 
OpenStack cloud. 
Six reasons to choose 
Ubuntu OpenStack
1	 	It offers a complete toolset for the 
deployment and easy management of your 
OpenStack cloud.
2	 	Entirely open source and certified it offers 
both technology and business freedom
3	 	It has been developed by engineers who 
number among the world’s foremost 
OpenStack experts.
4	 	It has been designed specifically to deliver 
the scalability and reliability that telcos and 
service providers need.
5	 	Ubuntu and OpenStack are a proven 
combination, Ubuntu having been the 
original reference operating system for 
OpenStack and remaining the number one 
OS for production OpenStack deployments.
6	 	Canonical routinely provides hands-on 
support to telcos and service providers, 
delivered directly by engineers who work 
on both the Ubuntu and OpenStack projects.
7	 	Canonical has worked on the design and 
deployment of OpenStack clouds with seven 
of the world’s top ten service providers. 
For the love 
of OpenStack

The cloud promises instantly-available 
computing resources that can be accessed 
by anyone with an internet connection. 
The result will transform the business of 
providing technology services to consumers 
and businesses. 
That’s the vision, at least.
The reality is somewhat more complex. 
So complex, in fact, that the cloud can 
become difficult to deliver cost-effectively. 
Whilst OpenStack is now established as the 
de facto open cloud platform, making it 
possible to develop carrier-grade value-
added services without spending millions on 
software and consulting, the project is hard. 
The many OpenStack components are not all 
interoperable without intimate knowledge of 
the code. If the wrong technology decisions are 
made at the outset, even the most commercially 
promising project could become a costly failure.
It could all be so different
Ubuntu OpenStack has been developed to 
ensure that any telco or service provider 
can deliver an OpenStack cloud with the 
performance, scalability and reliability 
necessary to meet customer SLA requirements. 
By deploying Ubuntu OpenStack cloud 
infrastructure, you can increase revenue from 
commodity compute and storage services, while 
harnessing the cloud to generate higher volumes 
of broadband traffic across your networks, 
increasing core revenues in the process.
And all this, without the familiar problems of 
proprietary software: costly, forced upgrade 
cycles, growing licensing bills as your operations 
scale and the inability to port workloads between 
platforms in the future.

and the reality

Case study: Deutsche Telekom
Famous for its T-Mobile brand, Deutsche 
Telekom is one of Europe’s largest mobile 
network operators. 
When the company approached Canonical, 
it was in the process of building a public 
cloud based on OpenStack, for the delivery 
of apps such as Office 365, Box and iMeet 
to its business users. But with OpenStack’s 
components changing fast, it was looking 
increasingly unlikely that the team would hit 
their deadline. 
A subscription to Canonical’s Ubuntu 
Advantage Availability Zone Service allowed 
them to benefit from support across their 
entire stack, from the underlying Ubuntu Server 
(with its hypervisor, networking and storage 
being particularly heavily utilised) through 
the OpenStack layer (including the Nova, 
Swift, Keystone and Horizon components in 
conjunction with Ceph) and all the way up to 
the Ubuntu Guest layer, on which many of the 
SaaS apps were running.
When issues were identified, Canonical found 
solutions and relayed them back to Deutsche 
Telekom. While the team there continued 
to work on their cloud, Canonical created 
hot fixes for genuine bugs, working with the 
OpenStack community to push them into the 
main packages.
Deutsche Telekom’s OpenStack cloud launched 
on time. It has now been delivering revenue 
for more than two years, with a major upgrade 
coming soon.

In essence, Ubuntu OpenStack is a combination 
of Ubuntu Server, an established Linux-based 
open source operating system, and the various 
open source components that make up the 
OpenStack cloud platform. But there is much 
more to it than that. Canonical has spent 
years developing a suite of deployment and 
management tools for cloud and distributed 
computing. These tools have been refined 
over many iterations to maximise their 
compatibility with OpenStack. Today, there is 
no faster way to deploy an OpenStack cloud 
and no easier way to manage one. 
The two key components 
of the platform
1. OpenStack itself
OpenStack is the world’s leading open-source 
cloud platform. It provides all the components 
needed to build and deploy an operational 
open-source cloud, from compute, storage 
and network components to a management 
dashboard and integrated usage metering 
engine. OpenStack has been created to meet 
telco and service provider requirements 
for service automation, scalability and high-
availability computing.
What exactly is 
Ubuntu OpenStack?
2. The Ubuntu Server operating system
Ubuntu is the most widely used developer 
platform for building open-source clouds. 
It was the original reference operating system 
for the OpenStack project and today, it is the 
most popular guest operating system on 
the world’s leading public cloud platforms. 
In sharing its release cycle with OpenStack, 
Ubuntu ensures that all the latest OpenStack 
features are supported on Ubuntu, as they 
are released. Long Term Support releases 
of Ubuntu are supported by Canonical for 
a minimum of five years.

Metal-as-a-Service (MAAS)
MAAS is a system for setting up the physical 
hardware base on which to run Ubuntu 
OpenStack. Once your servers are powered 
up and physically connected to the network, 
a few simple commands via MAAS will see 
them provisioned with all the Ubuntu Server 
packages they need, prior to the installation 
of OpenStack with Juju. 
You can add, commission, update, deploy and 
recycle physical servers through a simple web 
interface, or decommission them when they’re 
no longer needed. When commissioning a 
new server, MAAS can take care of hardware-
specific tasks such as burn-in tests, firmware 
and RAID upgrades, as well as checking that 
all machines are certified to run Ubuntu. 
MAAS provisions thousands of machines using a simple web UI

Our proven cloud experience
Ubuntu powers virtually all of the public clouds 
built with OpenStack, including Rackspace, 
DreamHost and HP’s public clouds. 
We provide support and services for many 
OpenStack environments around the world, 
from the host infrastructure on which the 
OpenStack software runs to a range of 
certified and individually optimised Ubuntu 
guest images for customer use on each cloud.
In recent years, we have gained unrivalled 
expertise with OpenStack. We can apply 
best practice and proven methods, quickly 
identifying pitfalls or gaps that might be 
overlooked by less experienced cloud 
partners.
Regular releases deliver the 
latest OpenStack features
For over a decade, a new version of Ubuntu 
has been released every six months, providing 
a commercially supported release on a 
predictable schedule. OpenStack releases 
updates, including its latest features, on the 
same six-monthly timeline.
Every two years, the release is deemed a Long 
Term Support (LTS) version, and supported by 
Canonical for the next five years. Based on this 
cycle, Ubuntu can provide telcos and service 
providers with emerging technologies as they 
become available.
To give you both the stability of the Ubuntu 
LTS versions, with access to new OpenStack 
features as they become available, we have 
developed the Cloud Archive. This is an online 
repository providing, at all times, a version of 
Why Canonical 
and Ubuntu?
the latest version of OpenStack that has been 
optimised for use with the current Ubuntu 
LTS release, complete with full commercial 
support. No other vendor can offer this level 
of OpenStack compatibility. 
Unrivalled integration 
with OpenStack
OpenStack is built into Ubuntu Server and 
Ubuntu is the reference operating system for 
OpenStack. An enormous amount of work 
has gone into the integration of OpenStack 
and Ubuntu and is leveraged by many 
cloud providers and enterprise customers. 
The seamless integration of Ubuntu and 
OpenStack is the principal reason why Ubuntu 
is the world’s most popular operating system 
on both private and public clouds.

We speed up cloud deployment and minimise 
risk by using Ubuntu reference architectures 
and deployment methodologies. It’s a 
tried-and-tested approach that has been 
developed during projects that have been 
delivered successfully for other customers, 
enabling service providers to capitalise on the 
experience of early market movers.
To ensure the fastest, lowest risk deployment, 
our methodology focuses on three core steps:
1. Assess
Canonical evaluates 
a service provider’s 
technical platform and 
operational readiness.
2. Architect 
and pilot
Canonical develops a 
technical architecture 
and deployment plan 
that meets the service 
provider’s needs, before 
deploying a pilot cloud as 
the foundation of a full 
operational deployment.
3. Full 
deployment
Canonical helps the 
service provider move 
from pilot to full 
deployment, transferring 
skills and supporting the 
implementation long term 
to ensure success.

All over the world, network operators and 
other service providers are deploying cloud 
infrastructure to increase network-based 
revenues, launch new compute and storage 
services and deliver cloud products from third 
parties to their subscribers. Yet problems 
remain.
Proprietary infrastructure is expensive 
to implement, prompting many operators 
to choose open-source cloud technologies 
instead – with OpenStack now the de facto 
choice.
Like any open source solution, it offers low 
capital and operational costs and scalability 
without licensing limits. Building a cloud 
remains a complex undertaking, however, 
requiring the integration of many disparate 
components. 
To simplify the process, reduce time to market, 
reduce risk and, above all help telcos and 
service providers deliver the best cloud services 
for their subscribers, Canonical has created 
the Ubuntu Service Provider Stack, integrating 
the infrastructure, tools and services needed 
to create, deploy and support a production-
ready OpenStack cloud. It’s the culmination of 
all the experience and product development 
described in this eBook – and it’s ready for you 
to adopt now.
