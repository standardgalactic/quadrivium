Foreword
The Norwegian government established the Abel Prize in mathematics in 2002, and
the ﬁrst prize was awarded in 2003. In addition to honoring the great Norwegian
mathematician Niels Henrik Abel by awarding an international prize for outstanding
scientiﬁc work in the ﬁeld of mathematics, the prize shall contribute toward raising
the status of mathematics in society and stimulate the interest for science among
school children and students. In keeping with this objective, the Niels Henrik Abel
Board has decided to ﬁnance annual Abel Symposia. The topic of the symposia
may be selected broadly in the area of pure and applied mathematics. The symposia
should be at the highest international level and serve to build bridges between
the national and international research communities. The Norwegian Mathematical
Society is responsible for the events. It has also been decided that the contributions
from these symposia should be presented in a series of proceedings, and Springer
Verlag has enthusiastically agreed to publish the series. The Niels Henrik Abel
Board is conﬁdent that the series will be a valuable contribution to the mathematical
literature.

The Abel Symposium 2015 focused on operator algebras and the wide ramiﬁcations
the ﬁeld has spawned. Operator algebras form a branch of mathematics that dates
back to the work of John von Neumann in the 1930s. Operator algebras were
proposed as a framework for quantum mechanics, with the observables replaced by
self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces and classical algebras of functions replaced
by algebras of operators. Spectacular breakthroughs by the Fields medalists Alain
Connes and Vaughan Jones marked the beginning of an impressive development,
in the course of which operator algebras established important ties with other areas
of mathematics, such as geometry, K-theory, number theory, quantum ﬁeld theory,
dynamical systems, and ergodic theory.
The ﬁrst Abel Symposium, held in 2004, also focused on operator algebras. It
is interesting to see the development and the remarkable advances that have been
made in this ﬁeld in the years since, which strikingly illustrate the vitality of the
ﬁeld.
The Abel Symposium 2015 took place on the ship Finnmarken, part of the
Coastal Express line (the Norwegian Hurtigruten), which offered a spectacular
venue. The ship left Bergen on August 7 and arrived at its ﬁnal destination, Harstad
in the Lofoten Islands, on August 11. The scenery the participants saw on the way
north was marvelous; for example, the ship sailed into both the Geirangerfjord and
Trollfjord.
There were altogether 26 talks given at the symposium. In keeping with the
organizers’ goals, there was no single main theme for the symposium, but rather
a variety of themes, all highlighting the richness of the subject. It is perhaps
appropriate to draw attention to one of the themes of the talks, which is the
classiﬁcation program for nuclear C-algebras. In fact, a truly major breakthrough

summarize and illuminate earlier results as seen from a higher vantage point.” Sophus Lie

Preface
in this area occurred just a few weeks before the Abel Symposium 2015—amazing
timing! Some of the protagonists in this effort—one that has stretched over more
than 25 years and has involved many researchers—gave talks on this very topic at
the symposium. The survey article by Wilhelm Winter in this proceedings volume
offers a panoramic view of the developments in the classiﬁcation program leading
up to the breakthrough mentioned above.
Alain Connes and Vaughan Jones were also among the participants, and they
gave talks on topics ranging, respectively, from gravity and the standard model in
physics to subfactors, knot theory, and the Thompson group, thus illustrating the
broad ramiﬁcations of operator algebras in modern mathematics.
Ola Bratteli and Uffe Haagerup, two main contributors to the theory of operator
algebras, tragically passed away in the months before the symposium. Their legacy
was commemorated and honored in a talk by Erling Størmer. One of the articles
in this volume is by Uffe Haagerup, and its publication was made possible with the
help of three of Haagerup’s colleagues from the University of Copenhagen, to whom
he had privately communicated the results shortly before his untimely passing.
The articles in this volume are organized alphabetically rather than thematically.
Some are research articles that present new results, others are surveys that cover the
development of a speciﬁc line of research, and yet others offer a combination of
survey and research. These contributions offer a multifaceted portrait of beautiful
mathematics that both newcomers to the ﬁeld of operator algebras and seasoned
researchers alike will appreciate.

C-Tensor Categories and Subfactors for Totally
Disconnected Groups
Yuki Arano and Stefaan Vaes
Abstract We associate a rigid C-tensor category C to a totally disconnected
locally compact group G and a compact open subgroup K < G. We characterize
when C has the Haagerup property or property (T), and when C is weakly
amenable. When G is compactly generated, we prove that C is essentially equivalent
to the planar algebra associated by Jones and Burstein to a group acting on a locally
ﬁnite bipartite graph. We then concretely realize C as the category of bimodules
generated by a hyperﬁnite subfactor.

Introduction
Rigid C-tensor categories arise as representation categories of compact groups and
compact quantum groups and also as (part of) the standard invariant of a ﬁnite index
subfactor. They can be viewed as a discrete group like structure and this analogy has
lead to a lot of recent results with a ﬂavor of geometric group theory, see [9, 17, 18,
25, 26].
In this paper, we introduce a rigid C-tensor category C canonically associated
with a totally disconnected locally compact group G and a compact open subgroup
K < G. Up to Morita equivalence, C does not depend on the choice of K. The
tensor category C can be described in several equivalent ways, see Sect. 2. Here,
we mention that the representation category of K is a full subcategory of C and that
the “quotient” of the fusion algebra of C by Rep K is the Hecke algebra of ﬁnitely
supported functions on KnG=K equipped with the convolution product.
When G is compactly generated, we explain how the C-tensor category C is
related to the planar algebra P (i.e. standard invariant of a subfactor) associated in
[5, 11] with a locally ﬁnite bipartite graph G and a closed subgroup G < Aut.G /. At

the same time, we prove that these planar algebras P can be realized by a hyperﬁnite
subfactor.
Given a ﬁnite index subfactor N  M, the notions of amenability, Haagerup
property and property (T) for its standard invariant GN;M were introduced by Popa
in [23, 24] in terms of the associated symmetric enveloping algebra T  S (see [21,
23]) and shown to only depend on GN;M. Denoting by C the tensor category of M-
M-bimodules generated by the subfactor, these properties were then formulated in
[26] intrinsically in terms of C , and in particular directly in terms of GN;M. We recall
these deﬁnitions and equivalent formulations in Sect. 4. Similarly, weak amenability
and the corresponding Cowling-Haagerup constant for the standard invariant GN;M
of a subfactor N  M were ﬁrst deﬁned in terms of the symmetric enveloping
inclusion in [3] and then intrinsically for rigid C-tensor categories in [26], see
Sect. 5. Reinterpreting [1, 6], it was proved in [26] that the representation category of
SUq.2/ (and thus, the Temperley-Lieb-Jones standard invariant) is weakly amenable
and has the Haagerup property, while the representation category of SUq.3/ has
property (T).
For the C-tensor categories C that we associate to a totally disconnected group
G, we characterize when C has the Haagerup property or property (T) and when C
is weakly amenable. We give several examples and counterexamples, in particular
illustrating that the Haagerup property/weak amenability of G is not sufﬁcient for
C to have the Haagerup property or to be weakly amenable. Even more so, when
C is the category associated with G D SL.2; Qp/, then the subcategory Rep K with
K D SL.2; Zp/ has the relative property (T). When G D SL.n; Qp/ with n  3,
the tensor category C has property (T), but we also give examples of property (T)
groups G such that C does not have property (T).
Our main technical tool is Ocneanu’s tube algebra [19] associated with any rigid
C-tensor category, see Sect. 3. When C is the C-tensor category of a totally
disconnected group G, we prove that the tube algebra is isomorphic with a canonical
dense -subalgebra of C0.G/ ÌAd G, where G acts on G by conjugation. We can
therefore express the above mentioned approximation and rigidity properties of the
tensor category C in terms of G and the dynamics of the action G ÕAd G by
conjugation.
In this paper, all locally compact groups are assumed to be second countable.
We call totally disconnected group every second countable, locally compact, totally
disconnected group.

C-Tensor Categories of Totally Disconnected Groups
Throughout this section, ﬁx a totally disconnected group G. For all compact open
subgroups K1; K2 < G, we deﬁne
C1 W
the category of K1-K2-L1.G/-modules, i.e. Hilbert spaces H equipped with
commuting unitary representations ..k1//k12K1 and ..k2//k22K2 and with

a normal -representation ˘ W L1.G/ ! B.H / that are equivariant with
respect to the left translation action K1 Õ G and the right translation action
K2 Õ G;
C2 W
the category of K1-L1.G=K2/-modules, i.e. Hilbert spaces H equipped with
a unitary representation ..k1//k12K1 and a normal -representation ˘ W
L1.G=K2/ ! B.H / that are covariant with respect to the left translation
action K1 Õ G=K2;
C3 W
the category of G-L1.G=K1/-L1.G=K2/-modules, i.e. Hilbert spaces H
equipped with a unitary representation ..g//g2G and with an L1.G=K1/-
L1.G=K2/-bimodule structure that are equivariant with respect to the left
translation action of G on G=K1 and G=K2;
and with morphisms given by bounded operators that intertwine the given structure.
Let K3 < G also be a compact open subgroup. We deﬁne the tensor product
H ˝K2 K of a K1-K2-L1.G/-module H and a K2-K3-L1.G/-module K as the
Hilbert space
H ˝K2 K D f 2 H ˝ K j ..k2/ ˝ .k2// D  for all k2 2 K2g
equipped with the unitary representations ..k1/ ˝ 1/k12K1 and .1 ˝ .k3//k32K3
and with the representation .˘H ˝ ˘K / ı  of L1.G/, where we denote by  W
L1.G/ ! L1.G/ ˝ L1.G/ the comultiplication given by ..F//.g; h/ D F.gh/
for all g; h 2 G.
The tensor product of a G-L1.G=K1/-L1.G=K2/-module H
and a G-
L1.G=K2/-L1.G=K3/-module K is denoted as H ˝L1.G=K2/ K and deﬁned
as the Hilbert space
H ˝L1.G=K2/ K

with the unitary representation .H .g/ ˝ K .g//g2G and with the L1.G=K1/-
L1.G=K3/-bimodule structure given by the left action of 1gK1 ˝ 1 for gK1 2 G=K1
and the right action of 1 ˝ 1hK3 for hK3 2 G=K3.
We say that objects H are of ﬁnite rank
C1 W
if HK2 WD f 2 H j .k2/ D  for all k2 2 K2g is ﬁnite dimensional; as
we will see in the proof of Proposition 2.2, this is equivalent with requiring
that K1H is ﬁnite dimensional;
C2 W
if H is ﬁnite dimensional;
C3 W
if 1eK1H is ﬁnite dimensional; as we will see in the proof of Proposition 2.2,
this is equivalent with requiring that H  1eK2 is ﬁnite dimensional.

Y. Arano and S. Vaes
Altogether, we get that C1 and C3 are C-2-categories. In both cases, the 0-
cells are the compact open subgroups of G. For all compact open subgroups
K1; K2 < G, the 1-cells are the categories Ci.K1; K2/ deﬁned above and Ci.K1; K2/
Ci.K2; K3/ ! Ci.K1; K3/ is given by the tensor product operation that we just
introduced. Restricting to ﬁnite rank objects, we get rigid C-2-categories.
Another typical example of a C-2-category is given by Hilbert bimodules over
II1 factors: the 0-cells are II1 factors, the 1-cells are the categories BimodM1-M2 of
Hilbert M1-M2-bimodules and BimodM1-M2  BimodM2-M3 ! BimodM1-M3 is given
by the Connes tensor product. Again, restricting to ﬁnite index bimodules, we get a
rigid C-2-category.
Remark 2.1 The standard invariant of an extremal ﬁnite index subfactor N  M can
be viewed as follows as a rigid C-2-category. There are only two 0-cells, namely
N and M; the 1-cells are the N-N, N-M, M-N and M-M-bimodules generated by the
subfactor; and we are given a favorite and generating 1-cell from N to M, namely
the N-M-bimodule L2.M/.
Abstractly, a rigid C-2-category C with only two 0-cells (say C and ),
irreducible tensor units in CCC and C, and a given generating object H 2 CC
is exactly the same as a standard -lattice in the sense of Popa [22, Deﬁnitions
1.1 and 2.1]. Indeed, for every n  0, deﬁne HC;n as the n-fold alternating tensor
product of H and H starting with H . Similarly, deﬁne H;n by starting with H .
For 0  j, deﬁne A0j D End.HC;j/. When 0  i  j < 1, deﬁne Aij  A0j as
Aij WD 1i ˝ End.H.1/i;ji/ viewed as a subalgebra of A0j D End.HC;j/ by writing
HC;j D HC;iH.1/i;ji. The standard solutions for the conjugate equations (see
Sect. 3) give rise to canonical projections eC 2 End.H H / and e 2 End.H H /
given by
eC D d.H /1sH s
H
and
e D d.H /1tH t
H ;
and thus to a representation of the Jones projections ej 2 Akl (for k < j < l).
Finally, if we equip all Aij with the normalized categorical trace, we have deﬁned a
standard -lattice in the sense of [22, Deﬁnitions 1.1 and 2.1]. Given two rigid C-
2-categories with ﬁxed generating objects as above, it is straightforward to check
that the associated standard -lattices are isomorphic if and only if there exists
an equivalence of C-2-categories preserving the generators. Conversely given a
standard -lattice G , by [22, Theorem 3.1], there exists an extremal subfactor
N  M whose standard invariant is G and we can deﬁne C as the C-2-category of
the subfactor N  M, generated by the N-M-bimodule L2.M/ as in the beginning of
this remark. One can also deﬁne C directly in terms of G (see e.g. [14, Section 4.1]
for a planar algebra version of this construction).
Thus, also subfactor planar algebras in the sense of [12] are “the same” as rigid
C-2-categories with two 0-cells and such a given generating object H 2 CC.
For more background on rigid C-tensor categories, we refer to [16].

Proposition 2.2 The C-2-categories C1 and C3 are naturally equivalent. In
particular, ﬁxing K1 D K2 D K, we get the naturally equivalent rigid C-tensor
categories C1;f .K < G/ and C3;f .K < G/. Up to Morita equivalence,1 these do not
depend on the choice of compact open subgroup K < G.
Proof Using the left and right translation operators g and g on L2.G/, one checks
that the following formulae deﬁne natural equivalences and their inverses between
the categories C1, C2 and C3.
•
C1 ! C2 W H 7! HK2, where HK2 is the space of right K2-invariant vectors
and where the K1-L1.G=K2/-module structure on HK2 is given by restricting
the corresponding structure on H .
•
C2 ! C1 W H 7! H ˝L1.G=K2/ L2.G/ given by
f 2 H ˝ L2.G/ j .1gK2 ˝ 1/ D .1 ˝ 1gK2/ for all g 2 Gg
D
M
g2G=K2
1gK2  H ˝ L2.gK2/
and where the K1-K2-L1.G/-module structure is given by .H .k1/ ˝ k1/k12K1,
.1 ˝ k2/k22K2 and multiplication with 1 ˝ F when F 2 L1.G/.
•
C3 ! C2 W H 7! 1eK1  H and where the K1-L1.G=K2/-module structure on
1eK1  H is given by restricting the corresponding structure on H .
•
C2 ! C3 W H 7! L2.G/ ˝K1 H given by
f 2 L2.G/ ˝ H j .k1 ˝ .k1// D  for all k1 2 K1g
and where the G-L1.G=K1/-L1.G=K2/-module structure is given by the rep-
resentation .g ˝ 1/g2G, multiplication with F ˝ 1 for F 2 L1.G=K1/ and
multiplication with .id ˝ ˘/.F/ for F 2 L1.G=K2/.
By deﬁnition, if H
2 C1 has ﬁnite rank, the Hilbert space HK2 is ﬁnite
dimensional. Conversely, if K 2 C2 and K is a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space,
then the corresponding object H 2 C1 has the property that both
K1H and HK2
are ﬁnite dimensional. Therefore, H 2 C1 has ﬁnite rank if and only if
K1H is a
ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space. A similar reasoning holds for objects in C3.
It is straightforward to check that the resulting equivalence C1 $ C3 preserves
tensor products, so that we have indeed an equivalence between the C-2-categories
C1 and C3.
To prove the ﬁnal statement in the proposition, it sufﬁces to observe that for
all compact open subgroups K1; K2 < G, we have that L2.K1K2/ is a nonzero
ﬁnite rank K1-K2-L1.G/-module and that L2.G=.K1 \ K2// is a nonzero ﬁnite rank
1In the sense of [15, Section 4], where the terminology weak Morita equivalence is used; see also
[25, Deﬁnition 7.3] and [18, Section 3].

The rigid C-2-categories C1 and C2 can as follows be fully faithfully embedded
in the category of bimodules over the hyperﬁnite II1 factor. We construct this
embedding in an extremal way in the sense of subfactors (cf. Corollary 2.4).
To do so, given a totally disconnected group G, we ﬁx a continuous action G Õ˛
P of G on the hyperﬁnite II1 factor P that is strictly outer in the sense of [27,
Deﬁnition 2.1]: the relative commutant P0 \ P Ì G equals C1. Moreover, we should
choose this action in such a way that Tr ı˛g D .g/1=2 Tr for all g 2 G (where
 is the modular function on G) and such that there exists a projection p 2 P of
ﬁnite trace with the property that ˛k. p/ D p whenever k belongs to a compact
subgroup of G. Such an action indeed exists: write P D R0 ˝ R1 where R0 is a copy
of the hyperﬁnite II1 factor and R1 is a copy of the hyperﬁnite II1 factor. Choose a
continuous trace scaling action RC
0 Õ˛1 R1. By [27, Corollary 5.2], we can choose
a strictly outer action G Õ˛0 R0. We then deﬁne ˛g D .˛0/g ˝ .˛1/.g/1=2 and we
take p D 1˝p1, where p1 2 R1 is any projection of ﬁnite trace. Whenever k belongs
to a compact subgroup of G, we have .k/ D 1 and thus ˛k. p/ D p.
Whenever K1; K2 < G are compact open subgroups of G, we write
ŒK1 W K2 D ŒK1 W K1 \ K2 ŒK2 W K1 \ K21 :
Fixing a left Haar measure  on G, we have ŒK1 W K2 D .K1/ .K2/1. Therefore,
we have that ŒK W gKg1 D .g/ for all compact open subgroups K < G and all
g 2 G.
Theorem 2.3 Let G be a totally disconnected group and choose a strictly outer
action G Õ˛ P on the hyperﬁnite II1 factor P and a projection p 2 P as above. For
every compact open subgroup K < G, write R.K/ D . pPp/K. Then each R.K/ is a
copy of the hyperﬁnite II1 factor.
To every K1-K2-L1.G/-module H , we associate the Hilbert R.K1/-R.K2/-bi-
module K given by (2.1) below. Then H 7! K is a fully faithful 2-functor. Also,
H has ﬁnite rank if and only if K is a ﬁnite index bimodule. In that case,
dimR.K1/.K / D ŒK1 W K21=2 dimC1.H /
and
dimR.K2/.K / D ŒK2 W K11=2 dimC1.H / ;
where dimC1.H / is the categorical dimension of H 2 C1.

We also write eK D ppK viewed as a projection in PÌK. Since P  PÌK  PÌG,

we conclude that T D T0 ˝ 1 for some T0 2 B.H / and that

Deﬁning the normal -homomorphism	 W L.G/ ! L.G/˝L.G/ given by 	.g/ D

It is easy to check that H 7! K naturally preserves tensor products. So, we have
found a fully faithful 2-functor from C1 to the C-2-category of Hilbert bimodules

To compute dimR.K2/.K /, observe that for all k 2 K1, r 2 K2 and g 2 G, we

Since pgPpg Ì K2 D pg.P Ì K2/pg is a factor (actually, K2 Õ pgPpg is a so-

To make the connection with the categorical dimension of H , it is useful to view
H as the image of a G-L1.G=K1/-L1.G=K2/-module H 0 under the equivalence

If H has ﬁnite rank, also H 0 has ﬁnite rank so that H 0  1eK2 and 1eK1  H 0 are
ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces. It then follows that K is a ﬁnite index bimodule.
Conversely, assume that K has ﬁnite index. For every g 2 G, write

D ŒK2 W K1 dim.1eK1  H 0  1K1gK2/ .g/1=2 :

we conclude that there are only ﬁnitely many double cosets g 2 K1nG=K2 for which
1K2g1K1 H 0 1eK2 is nonzero and for each of them, it is a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert
space. This implies that H 0  1eK2 is ﬁnite dimensional, so that H 0 has ﬁnite rank.
We have proved that H
7! K is a fully faithful 2-functor from C1;f to the
ﬁnite index bimodules over hyperﬁnite II1 factors. Moreover, for given compact
open subgroups K1; K2 < G, the ratio between dimR.K1/.K / and dimR.K2/.K /
equals ŒK1 W K2 for all ﬁnite rank K1-K2-L1.G/-modules H . Since the functor
is fully faithful, this then also holds for all R.K1/-R.K2/-subbimodules of K . It
follows that the categorical dimension of K equals

Corollary 2.4 Let G be a totally disconnected group with compact open subgroups
K˙ < G and assume that H is a ﬁnite rank G-L1.G=KC/-L1.G=K/-module.
Denote by C
D .CCC; CC; CC; C/ the C-2-category of G-L1.G=K˙/-
L1.G=K˙/-modules (with 0-cells KC and K) generated by the alternating tensor
products of H and its adjoint.
Combining Proposition 2.2 and Theorem 2.3, we ﬁnd an extremal hyperﬁnite
subfactor N  M whose standard invariant, viewed as the C-2-category of N-N, N-
M, M-N and M-M-bimodules generated by the N-M-bimodule L2.M/, is equivalent
with .C ; H / (cf. Remark 2.1).
Proof A combination of Proposition 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 provides the ﬁnite index
R.KC/-R.K/-bimodule K associated with H . Take nonzero projections p˙ 2
R.K˙/ such that writing N D pCR.KC/pC and M D pR.K/p, we have that
dimM. pC  K  p/ D 1. We can then view N  M in such a way that L2.M/ Š
pC  K  p as N-M-bimodules. The C-2-category of N-N, N-M, M-N and M-
M-bimodules generated by the N-M-bimodule L2.M/ is by construction equivalent
with the rigid C-2-category of R.K˙/-R.K˙/-bimodules generated by K . Since
the 2-functor in Theorem 2.3 is fully faithful, this C-2-category is equivalent with
C and this equivalence maps the N-M-bimodule L2.M/ to H 2 CC.

From Corollary 2.4, we get the following result.
Proposition 2.5 Let P be the subfactor planar algebra of [5, 11] associated with
a connected locally ﬁnite bipartite graph G , with edge set E and source and target
maps s W E ! VC, t W E ! V, together with2 a closed subgroup G < Aut.G /
acting transitively on VC as well as on V. Fix vertices v˙ 2 V˙ and write K˙ D
Stab v˙.
There exists an extremal hyperﬁnite subfactor N  M whose standard invariant
is isomorphic with P. We have ŒM W N D ı2 where

construction. But only when we take  to be a multiple of the function v 7! ŒStab v W Stab vC1=2,
we actually obtain a subfactor planar algebra, contrary to what is claimed in [5, Proposition 4.1].

Moreover, P can be described as the rigid C-2-category C3;f .G; K˙; K˙/ of all
ﬁnite rank G-L1.G=K˙/-L1.G=K˙/-modules together with the generating object
`2.E / 2 C3;f .G; KC; K/ (cf. Remark 2.1).
Proof We are given G Õ E and G Õ VC, G Õ V such that the source and target
maps s; t are G-equivariant and such that G acts transitively on VC and on V. Put
K˙ D Stab v˙ and note that K˙ < G are compact open subgroups. We identify
G=K˙ D V˙ via the map gK˙ 7! g  v˙. In this way, H WD `2.E / naturally
becomes a ﬁnite rank G-L1.G=KC/-L1.G=K/-module. Denote by C the C-2-
category of G-L1.G=K˙/-L1.G=K˙/-modules generated by the alternating tensor
products of H and its adjoint.
In the 2-category C3, the n-fold tensor product H ˝ H ˝    equals `2.EC;n/,
where EC;n is the set of paths in the graph G starting at an even vertex and having
length n. Similarly, the n-fold tensor product H ˝ H ˝    equals `2.E;n/, where
E;n is the set of paths of length n starting at an odd vertex. So by construction,
under the equivalence of Remark 2.1, C together with its generator H
2 CC
corresponds exactly to the planar algebra P constructed in [5, 11].
By Corollary 2.4, we get that .C ; H / is the standard invariant of an extremal
hyperﬁnite subfactor N  M. In particular, ŒM W N D ı2 with ı D dimC3.H /.
Combining (2.6) with (2.4), and using that

To conclude the proof of the proposition, it remains to show that C is equal to
the C-2-category of all ﬁnite rank G-L1.G=K˙/-L1.G=K˙/-modules. For the
G-L1.G=KC/-L1.G=K/-modules, this amounts to proving that all irreducible
representations of KC \ K appear in
`2.paths starting at vC and ending at v/ :

Since the graph is connected, the action of KC \ K on this set of paths is faithful
and the result follows. The other cases are proved in the same way.

Remark 2.6 Note that the subfactors N  M in Proposition 2.5 are irreducible
precisely when G acts transitively on the set of edges and there are no multiple
edges. This means that the totally disconnected group G is generated by the compact
open subgroups K˙ < G and that we can identify E D G=.KC \K/, V˙ D G=K˙
with the natural source and target maps G=.KC \ K/ ! G=K˙. The irreducible
subfactor N  M then has integer index given by ŒM W N D ŒKC W KC \ K ŒK W

We ﬁnally note that the rigid C-tensor categories C1;f .K < G/ and C3;f .K < G/
also arise in a different way as categories of bimodules over a II1 factor in the
case where K < G is the Schlichting completion of a Hecke pair  <  ,
cf. [7, Section 4].
Recall that a Hecke pair consists of a countable group  together with a subgroup
 <  that is almost normal, meaning that gg1 \  has ﬁnite index in  for
all g 2  . The left translation action of  on  = gives a homomorphism  of
 to the group of permutations of  =. The closure G of . / for the topology
of pointwise convergence is a totally disconnected group and the stabilizer K of
the point e 2  = is a compact open subgroup of G with the property that  D
1.K/. One calls .G; K/ the Schlichting completion of the Hecke pair .; /. Note
that there is a natural identiﬁcation of G=K and  =.
Proposition 2.7 Let  <  be a Hecke pair with Schlichting completion K <
G. Choose an action  Õ˛ P of  by outer automorphisms of a II1 factor P.
Deﬁne N D P Ì  and M D P Ì  . Note that N  M is an irreducible, quasi-
regular inclusion of II1 factors. Denote by C the tensor category of ﬁnite index
N-N-bimodules generated by the ﬁnite index N-subbimodules of L2.M/.
Then, C and the earlier deﬁned C1;f .K < G/ and C3;f .K < G/ are naturally
equivalent rigid C-tensor categories.
Proof Deﬁne

To deﬁne the tensor product of two objects in C4, it is useful to view H 2 C4 as a
family of Hilbert spaces .Hg/g2 together with unitary operators .k/ W Hg ! Hkg
and .k/ W Hg ! Hgk1 for all k 2 , satisfying the obvious relations. The tensor

for all k 2 , h 2  . Of course, choosing a section i W  = !  , we have
.H ˝ K /g Š
M
h2 =
.Hi.h/ ˝ Ki.h/1g/ ;
but this isomorphism depends on the choice of the section.
As in Proposition 2.2, C4 and C5 are equivalent C-categories, where the
equivalence and its inverse are deﬁned as follows.

C4 ! C5 W H 7! K , with

and with the natural -`1. =/-module structure. Note that Kg Š Hg, but
again, this isomorphism depends on a choice of section  = !  .
•
C5 ! C4 W K 7! H , with Hg D Kg and the obvious --`1. /-module
structure.
We say that an object H
2 C5 has ﬁnite rank if H is a ﬁnite dimensional
Hilbert space. This is equivalent to requiring that all Hilbert spaces Hg are ﬁnite
dimensional and that there are only ﬁnitely many double cosets g for which Hg
is nonzero. Similarly, we say that an object H 2 C4 has ﬁnite rank if all Hilbert
spaces Hg are ﬁnite dimensional and if there are only ﬁnitely many double cosets
g for which Hg is nonzero. Note here that an algebraic variant of the category
of ﬁnite rank objects in C4 was already introduced in [29].
In this way, we have deﬁned the rigid C-tensor category C4;f . <  / consisting
of the ﬁnite rank objects in C4. Note that, in a different context, this rigid C-tensor
category C4;f . <  / already appeared in [7, Section 4].
Denote by  W  ! G the canonical homomorphism. Identifying G=K and  =
and using the homomorphism  W  ! K, every K-L1.G=K/-module H also is a
-`1. =/-module.This deﬁnes a functor C2.K < G/ ! C5. <  / that is fully
faithful because ./ is dense in K. Note however that this fully faithful functor
need not be an equivalence of categories: an object H 2 C5. <  / is isomorphic
with an object in the range of this functor if and only if the representation of  on

H is of the form k 7! ..k// for a (necessarily unique) continuous representation
 of K on H .
Composing with the equivalence of categories in Proposition 2.2, we have found
the fully faithful C-tensor functor  W C3.K < G/ ! C4. <  /, sending
ﬁnite rank objects to ﬁnite rank objects. By construction,  maps the G-L1.G=K/-
L1.G=K/-module L2.G=K/ ˝ L2.G=K/ (with G-action given by .g ˝ g/g2G and
obvious left and right L1.G=K/-action) to the --`1. /-module `2. /.
Next, given the outer action  Õ˛ P, we write N D P Ì  and M D P Ì  .
Consider the category Bimod.N/ of Hilbert N-N-bimodules. We deﬁne the natural
fully faithful C-tensor functor C4. <  / ! Bimod.N/ W H
7! K where
K D L2.P/ ˝ H and where the N-N-bimodule structure on K is given by
.auk/  .b ˝ /  .dur/ D a˛k.b/˛kh.d/ ˝ .k/.r1/
for all a; b; d 2 P, k; r 2 , h 2  and  2 Hh. By construction, this functor maps
the --`1. /-module `2. / to the N-N-bimodule L2.M/.
Denoting by C the tensor category of ﬁnite index N-N-bimodules generated by
the ﬁnite index N-subbimodules of L2.M/, it follows that C is naturally monoidally
equivalent to the tensor subcategory C0 of C3;f .K < G/ generated by the ﬁnite rank
subobjects of L2.G=K/ ˝ L2.G=K/. So, it remains to prove that C0 D C3;f .K < G/.
Taking the n-th tensor power of L2.G=K/ ˝ L2.G=K/ and applying the equivalence
between the categories C3;f .K < G/ and C2;f .K < G/, it sufﬁces to show that
every irreducible K-L1.G=K/-module appears in one of the K-L1.G=K/-modules
L2.G=K/ ˝    ˝ L2.G=K/ with diagonal G-action and action of L1.G=K/ on the
last tensor factor. Reducing with the projections 1gK, this amounts to proving that
for every g 2 G, every irreducible representation of the compact group K \ gKg1
appears in a tensor power of L2.G=K/. Because K < G is a Schlichting completion,
we have that T

Formally allowing for inﬁnite direct sums in C , one deﬁnes the C-tensor
category of ind-objects in C . Later in this section, we will only consider the rigid
C-tensor category C of ﬁnite rank G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-modules for a given
totally disconnected group G with compact open subgroup K < G. In that case,
the ind-category precisely4 is the C-tensor category of all G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-
modules. Whenever K1; K2 are ind-objects, we denote by .K1; K2/ the vector
space of ﬁnitely supported morphisms, where a morphism V W K2 ! K1 is said
to be ﬁnitely supported if there exist projections pi of Ki onto a ﬁnite dimensional
subobject (i.e. an object in C ) such that V D p1V D Vp2.
We say that an ind-object H0 in C is full if every irreducible object i 2 Irr.C / is
isomorphic with a subobject of H0. We deﬁne the tube -algebra of C with respect
to a full ind-object H0 as the vector space
A D
M
˛2Irr.C /
.H0˛; ˛H0/
on which the -algebra structure is deﬁned in the same way as above. Note that
.H0; H0/ naturally is a -subalgebra of A , given by taking ˛ D " in the above
description of A . In particular, every projection of p of H0 on a ﬁnite dimensional
subobject of H0 can be viewed as a projection p 2 A . These projections serve as
local units: for every ﬁnite subset F  A , there exists such a projection p satisfying
p  V D V  p for all V 2 F.
Whenever p" is the projection of H0 onto a copy of the trivial object ", we
identify p"  A  p" with the fusion -algebra CŒC  of C , i.e. the -algebra with
vector space basis Irr.C /, product given by the fusion rules and -operation given
by the adjoint object.
To every full family I of objects in C , we can associate the full ind-object H0 by
taking the direct sum of all i 2 I. The tube -algebra of C associated with I is then
naturally a -subalgebra of the tube -algebra of C associated with H0. If every
irreducible object of C appears with ﬁnite multiplicity in H0, then this inclusion is
an equality and both tube -algebras are naturally isomorphic.
For the rest of this section, we ﬁx a totally disconnected group G and a compact
open subgroup K < G. We denote by C the rigid C-tensor category of all ﬁnite rank
G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-modules, which we denoted as C3;f .K < G/ in Sect. 2. We
determine the tube -algebra A of C with respect to the following full ind-object.
4Using Proposition 2.2, every G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-module is a direct sum of ﬁnite rank
modules because every K-L1.G=K/-module is a direct sum of ﬁnite dimensional modules,
which follows because every unitary representation of a compact group is a direct sum of ﬁnite
dimensional representations.

as well as the von Neumann algebra L1.G/ ÌAd G. We ﬁx the left Haar measure

(3.2)
Note that the modular function  is afﬁliated with the center of L1.G/ ÌAd G, so
that L1.G/ ÌAd G need not be a factor. Also note that the measure used in (3.2) is
half way between the left and the right Haar measure of G.
We consider the dense -algebra Pol.L1.G/ ÌAd G/ deﬁned as
Pol.L1.G/ ÌAd G/ D spanf1U ux pL j U  G compact open subset ; x 2 G ;

Note that Pol.L1.G/ ÌAd G/ equals the linear span of all Ff where F and f are
continuous, compactly supported, locally constant functions on G.
We now identify the tube -algebra of C with Pol.L1.G/ ÌAd G/. For every
x 2 G and every irreducible representation  W K \ xKx1 ! U .K /, we denote
by H .; x/ 2 Irr.C / the irreducible G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-module such that  is
isomorphic with the representation of K \ xKx1 on 1xK  H .; x/  1eK. Note that

We denote by  the character of , i.e. the locally constant function with support
K \ xKx1 and .k/ D Tr..k// for all k 2 K \ xKx1.
Theorem 3.1 The G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-module H0 introduced in (3.1) is full.
There is a natural -anti-isomorphism  of the associated tube -algebra A onto
the -algebra Pol.L1.G/ ÌAd G/. The -anti-isomorphism  is trace preserving.
Denoting by p" the projection in A that corresponds to the unique copy of the
trivial object " in H0 and identifying p"  A  p" with the fusion -algebra of C , we
have that . p"/ D 1KpK and that the restriction of  to CŒC  is given by

(3.5)
where d.; x/ denotes the categorical dimension of .; x/ 2 Irr.C / and dim./
denotes the ordinary dimension of the representation .
Proof To see that H0 is full, it sufﬁces to observe that for every h 2 G, the unitary
representation of K \ hKh1 on 1eK  H0  1hK contains the regular representation of
K \ hKh1.
Assume that 	 W C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G ! B.K / is any nondegenerate -representation.
As follows, we associate with 	 a unitary half braiding5 on ind-C . Whenever H
is a G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-module, we consider a new G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-
module with underlying Hilbert space K ˝ H and structure maps
K ˝H .g/ D 	.g/ ˝ H .g/ ;
K ˝H .F/ D .	 ˝ H /.F/ ;

for all g 2 G, F 2 L1.G=K/, with .F/.g; hK/ D F.ghK/.
We similarly turn H ˝K into a G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-module with structure

Deﬁning the unitary U 2 M.C0.G/ ˝ K.H // given by U.x/ D H .x/ for all

5Formally, a unitary half braiding is an object in the Drinfeld center of ind-C . More concretely,
a unitary half braiding consists of an underlying ind-object K1 together with natural unitary
isomorphisms H K1 ! K1H for all objects H . We refer to [17, Section 2.1] for further details.

20
Y. Arano and S. Vaes
the unitary ˙.	 ˝ id/.U/ is an isomorphism between the G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-
modules K ˝ H and H ˝ K . So, deﬁning
K1 WD K ˝ L2.G=K/ Š L2.G=K/ ˝ K ;
we have found the G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-module K1 with the property that for
every G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-module H , there is a natural unitary isomorphism
H W H K1 ! K1H :
Here and in what follows, we denote by concatenation the tensor product in the
category of G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-modules. So,  is a unitary half braiding for
ind-C .
Using the ind-object H0 deﬁned in (3.1) and recalling that K1H0 D K ˝ H0
as Hilbert spaces, we deﬁne the Hilbert space
K2 D .K ˝ H0; "/
and we consider the tube -algebra A associated with H0. Using standard solutions
for the conjugate equations, there is a natural linear bijection
V 2 .H0H ; H H0/ 7! eV 2 .H H0; H0H /
between ﬁnitely supported morphisms.
By [25, Proposition 3.14], using the partial categorical trace TrH ˝id ˝ id, the
unitary half braiding  gives rise to a nondegenerate -anti-homomorphism  W

for all H 2 C ,  2 K2 and all ﬁnitely supported V 2 .H0H ; H H0/.
We now compute the expression in (3.6) more concretely. Whenever h 2 G and
K0 < K is an open subgroup such that hK0h1  K, we deﬁne the ﬁnite rank G-
L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-module L2.G=K0/h with underlying Hilbert space L2.G=K0/
and structure maps
.x  /.gK0/ D .x1gK0/ ; .F1    F2/.gK0/ D F1.gK/ .gK0/ F2.gh1K/ :
Note that there is a natural isomorphism L2.G=K0/h Š L2.G=K0/h1. Letting
K0 tend to feg, the direct limit of L2.G=K0/h1 becomes L2.G/h1. Since H0 D

and we view L2.G=K0/h  H0 whenever h 2 G and K0 < K \ h1Kh is an open
subgroup.
The Hilbert space K2 equals the space of K-invariant vectors in 1eK .K ˝H0/
1eK. In this way, the space of K-invariant vectors in 1eK .K ˝L2.G=K0/h/1eK nat-
urally is a subspace of K2. But this last space of K-invariant vectors can be unitarily
identiﬁed with 	.1Kh1 phK0h1/K by sending the vector 0 2 	.1Kh1 phK0h1/K
to the vector

(3.7)
whenever K2 < K is a small enough open subgroup such that H .k/ is the identity
on H  1eK for all k 2 K2. Note that because H has ﬁnite rank, such an open
subgroup K2 exists. Also, there are only ﬁnitely many x 2 G=K such that 1xKH 1eK
is nonzero. Therefore, the sum appearing in (3.7) is ﬁnite.
Applying this to the regular representation C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G ! B.L2.G  G//, we
see that (3.7) provides a -anti-homomorphisms  from A to Pol.L1.G/ ÌAd G/.
Then, a direct computation gives that  is trace preserving, using the trace Tr on
L1.G/ ÌAd G deﬁned in (3.2). In particular,  is injective.
We now prove that  is surjective. Fix elements g; h; ˛ 2 G satisfying ˛g D h˛.
Choose any open subgroup K0 < K such that gK0g1, ˛K0˛1 and K1 WD
h1˛K0˛1h are all subgroups of K. Put H

L2.G=K0/g and L2.G=K1/h are well deﬁned objects in C . For every k 2 K, we

In both cases, we get an orthogonal family of vectors indexed by

So, we can uniquely deﬁne V 2


A direct computation gives that .V/ is equal to a nonzero multiple of

(3.8)
From (3.7), we also get that  maps .H0; H0/  A onto Pol.L1.KnG/ Ì K/,
deﬁned as the linear span of all

follows that  is surjective.
Finally, by restricting (3.7) to the cases where g D h D e and K0 D K1 D K, we
ﬁnd that (3.5) holds.

By [9, Theorem 6.6], the function ' W Irr.C / ! C is a cp-multiplier in the sense of
Deﬁnition 3.2 if and only if !' is positive on A in the sense that !'.V  V#/  0
for all V 2 A . In Proposition 5.1, we prove a characterization of cb-multipliers in
terms of completely bounded multipliers of the tube -algebra.
From Theorem 3.1, we then get the following result. We again denote by C be
the rigid C-tensor category of ﬁnite rank G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-modules and we
identify Irr.C / as in (3.4) with the set of pairs .; x/ where x 2 KnG=K and  is an
irreducible representation of the compact group K \ xKx1. In order to identify the
c0 cp-multipliers on C , we introduce the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.3 We say that a complex measure  on G (i.e. an element of C0.G/)
is c0 if

the complex measure x deﬁned by x.F/ D !.Fux/ for all F 2 C0.G/ is c0
and if the function G ! C
r .G/ W x 7! .x/ tends to zero at inﬁnity, i.e.
limx!1 k.x/k D 0.
Proposition 3.4 The formula
'.; x/ D !. pK dim./1 ux pK/
(3.10)
gives a bijection between the cp-multipliers ' on Irr.C / and the positive functionals
! on the C-algebra q.C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G/q, where q D 1KpK.

24
Y. Arano and S. Vaes
The cp-multiplier ' is c0 if and only if the positive functional ! is c0 in the sense
of Deﬁnition 3.3.
Using the notations Cu.C / and Cr.C / of [26, Deﬁnition 4.1] for the universal
and reduced C-algebra of C , we have the natural anti-isomorphisms Cu.C / !
q.C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G/q and Cr.C / ! q.C0.G/ Ìr
Ad G/q.
Proof Note that the G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-module H0 in (3.1) contains exactly
once the trivial module. The ﬁrst part of the proposition is then a direct consequence
of Theorem 3.1 and the above mentioned characterization [9] of cp-multipliers as
positive functionals on the tube -algebra. The isomorphisms for Cu.C / and Cr.C /
follow in the same way.
Fix a positive functional ! on q.C0.G/Ì f
AdG/q with corresponding cp-multiplier
' W Irr.C / ! C given by (3.10). We extend ! to C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G by !.T/ D !.qTq/.
For every x 2 G, deﬁne x 2 C0.G/ given by x.F/ D !.Fux/ for all F 2 C0.G/.
Note that x is supported on K \ xKx1 and that x is Ad.K \ xKx1/-invariant.
Therefore, .x/ 2 Z .L.K \ xKx1//. For every  2 Irr.K \ xKx1/, denote by
z 2 Z .L.K \ xKx1// the corresponding minimal central projection. From (3.10),
we get that
.x/z D '.; x/z
for all x 2 G ;  2 Irr.K \ xKx1/ :
(3.11)
For a ﬁxed x 2 G, an element T 2 Z .L.K \ xKx1// belongs to C
r .G/ if and only
if T 2 C
r .K \ xKx1/ if and only if lim!1 kTzk D 0.
Also, kTk D sup2Irr.K\xKx1/ kTzk. So by (3.11), we get that x is c0 if and

Haagerup Property and Property (T) for C .K < G/
In Deﬁnition 3.2, we already recalled the notion of a cp-multiplier ' W Irr.C / ! C
on a rigid C-tensor category C . In terms of cp-multipliers, amenability of a rigid
C-tensor category, as deﬁned in [13, 21], amounts to the existence of ﬁnitely
supported cp-multipliers 'n W Irr.C / ! C that converge to 1 pointwise, see [26,
Proposition 5.3]. Following [26, Deﬁnition 5.1], a rigid C-tensor category C has
the Haagerup property if there exist c0 cp-multipliers 'n W Irr.C / ! C that
converge to 1 pointwise, while C has property (T) if all cp-multipliers converging
to 1 pointwise, must converge to 1 uniformly.
Similarly, when C1 is a full C-tensor subcategory of C , we say that C1  C has
the relative property (T) if all cp-multipliers on C converging to 1 pointwise, must
converge to 1 uniformly on Irr.C1/  Irr.C /.
We now turn back to the rigid C-tensor category C of ﬁnite rank G-L1.G=K/-
L1.G=K/-modules, where G is a totally disconnected group G and K < G is
a compact open subgroup. Note that Rep K is a full C-tensor subcategory of
C , consisting of the G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-modules H with the property that
1xK  H  1eK is zero for all x 62 K.
Recall from Deﬁnition 3.3 the notion of a c0 complex measure on G. We identify
the space of complex measures with C0.G/ and we denote by S .C0.G// 
C0.G/ the state space of C0.G/, i.e. the set of probability measures on G.
Theorem 4.1 Let G be a totally disconnected group and K < G a compact open
subgroup. Denote by C the rigid C-tensor category of ﬁnite rank G-L1.G=K/-
L1.G=K/-modules.
1. C is amenable if and only if G is amenable.
2. C has the Haagerup property if and only if G has the Haagerup property and
there exists a sequence of c0 probability measures n 2 S .C0.G// such that
n ! ıe weakly and such that kn ı Ad x  nk ! 0 uniformly on compact
sets of x 2 G.
3. C has property (T) if and only if G has property (T) and every sequence of Ad G-
invariant probability measures n 2 S .C0.G// that converges to ıe weakly
must converge in norm.

probability measures n
2 S .C0.G// such that n

knıAd xnk ! 0 uniformly on compact sets of x 2 G satisﬁes knıek ! 0.
Proof Denote by  W C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G ! C the character given by
.Ff / D F.e/
Z
G
f.x/ dx :
Write q D 1KpK.
1. Combining Proposition 3.4 and [26, Proposition 5.3], we get that C is amenable
if and only if the canonical -homomorphism from q.C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G/q onto
q.C0.G/ Ìr
Ad G/q is an isomorphism. This holds if and only if G is amenable.
2. First assume that C has the Haagerup property. By Proposition 3.4, we ﬁnd a
sequence of states !n on q.C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G/q such that !n !  weakly and such
that every !n is a c0 state in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.3. For every x 2 G, deﬁne
n.x/ 2 C0.G/ given by n.x/.F/ D !n.Fux/.
Using the strictly continuous extension of !n to M.C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G/, we get that
x 7! !n.ux/ is a sequence of continuous positive deﬁnite functions converging
to 1 uniformly on compact subsets of G. We claim that for every ﬁxed n, the
function x 7! !n.x/ tends to 0 at inﬁnity. Denote by K W C
r .G/ ! C the state
given by composing the conditional expectation C
r .G/ ! C
r .K/ with the trivial
representation  W C
r .K/ ! C. Then,
!n.x/ D K..n.x///
and the claim is proven. So, G has the Haagerup property.
The restriction of !n to C0.G/ provides a sequence of c0 probability measures
n 2 S .C0.G// such that n ! ıe weakly and kn ı Ad x  nk ! 0 uniformly
on compact sets of x 2 G.
Conversely assume that G has the Haagerup property and that n is such
a sequence of probability measures. By restricting n to K, normalizing and
integrating R
K.n ı Ad k/ dk, we may assume that the probability measures n are
supported on K and are Ad K-invariant. Fix a strictly positive right K-invariant
function w W G ! RC

By construction, for every x 2 G, the measure Qn ı Ad x is absolutely continuous
with respect to Qn. We denote by n.x/ the Radon-Nikodym derivative and deﬁne
the unitary representations
n W G ! U .L2.G; Qn// W n.x/ D n.x/1=2  ı Ad x1 :
We also deﬁne n W C0.G/ ! B.L2.G; Qn// given by multiplication operators and
we have thus deﬁned a nondegenerate-representation of C0.G/Ì f
AdG on L2.G; Qn/.
Note that n is absolutely continuous with respect to Qn. We denote by n 2
L2.G; Qn/ the square root of the Radon-Nikodym derivative of n with respect to
Qn. Since both n and Qn are Ad K-invariant, we get that n. pK/n D n. Since n
is supported on K, also n is supported on K meaning that .1K/n D n.
Since G has the Haagerup property, we can also ﬁx a unitary representation  W
G ! U .H / and a sequence of .K/-invariant unit vectors n 2 H such that
k.x/n  nk ! 0 uniformly on compact sets of x 2 G and, for every ﬁxed n, the
function x 7! h.x/n; ni tends to zero at inﬁnity.
The formulas  .x/ D n.x/˝.x/ and  .F/ D .F/˝1 deﬁne a nondegenerate
-representation of C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G on L2.G; Qn/ ˝ H . We deﬁne the states !n on
C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G given by !n.T/ D h .T/.n ˝ n/; n ˝ ni. By construction, !n.q/ D
1 for all n and !n !  weakly. It remains to prove that each !n is a c0 state.
Proposition 3.4 then gives that C has the Haagerup property.
Fix n. Deﬁning n.x/ 2 C0.G/ given by n.x/.F/ D !n.Fux/, we get that
n.x/.F/ D hn.F/ .x/ n; ni h.x/n; ni :
Since the function x 7! h.x/n; ni tends to zero at inﬁnity, we get that even the
function x 7! kn.x/k tends to zero at inﬁnity. So, we only have to show that for
every ﬁxed x, the complex measure given by F 7! hn.F/ .x/ n; ni is c0. By
construction, this complex measure is absolutely continuous with respect to Qn. The
conclusion then follows from Lemma 3.5.
3. Note that it follows from [26, Proposition 5.5] that C has property (T) if and only
if every sequence of states on q.C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G/q converging weakly to  must
converge to  in norm.
First assume that C has property (T). Both states on C.G/ and Ad G-invariant
states on C0.G/ give rise to states on C0.G/Ì f
AdG. One implication of 3 thus follows
immediately. Conversely assume that G has property (T) and that every sequence of
Ad G-invariant probability measures n 2 S .C0.G// converging weakly to ıe
must converge in norm to ıe. Let !n be a sequence of states on q.C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G/q
converging to  weakly. Let p 2 C.G/ be the Kazhdan projection. Replacing !n
by !n. p/1 p!np, we may assume that !n is left and right G-invariant. This means
that !n.Fux/ D n.F/ for all F 2 C0.G/, x 2 G, where n is a sequence of Ad G-
invariant probability measures on G converging weakly to ıe. Thus kn  ıek ! 0
so that k!n  k ! 0.

Y. Arano and S. Vaes
4. First assume that Rep K  C has the relative property (T) and take a sequence
of probability measures n 2 S .C0.G// such that n ! ıe weakly and such
that kn ı Ad x  nk ! 0 uniformly on compact sets of x 2 G. We must prove
that kn ıek ! 0. As in the proof of 2, we may assume that n is supported on
K and that n is Ad K-invariant, so that we can construct a sequence of states !n
on C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G such that !n ! ıe weakly, !n D q  !n  q and !njC0.G/ D n
for all n.
The formula (3.10) associates to !n a sequence of cp-multipliers 'n on C
converging to 1 pointwise. Since Rep K  C has the relative property (T), we
conclude that 'n.; e/ ! 1 uniformly on  2 Irr.K/. Using [26, Lemma 5.6], it
follows that k!njC0.G/  ıek ! 0. So, kn  ıek ! 0.
To prove the converse, let 'n W Irr.C / ! C be a sequence of cp-multipliers on C
converging to 1 pointwise. Denote by !n the states on q.C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G/q associated
with 'n in Proposition 3.4. Since !n !  weakly, the restriction n WD !njC0.G/
is a sequence of probability measures on G such that n ! ıe weakly and kn ı
Ad x  nk ! 0 uniformly on compact sets of x 2 G. By our assumption, kn 
ıek ! 0. For every  2 Irr.K/, the function dim./1 has norm 1. Therefore,
!n.dim./1/ ! 1 uniformly on Irr.K/. By (3.10), this means that 'n ! 1
uniformly on Irr.K/.

The following proposition gives a concrete example where G has the Haagerup
property, while C .K < G/ does not and even has Rep K as a full C-tensor
subcategory with the relative property (T).
Proposition 4.2 Let F be a non-Archimedean local ﬁeld with characteristic ¤ 2.
Let k  2 and deﬁne G D SL.k; F/. Let K < G be a compact open subgroup, e.g.
K D SL.k; O/, where O is the ring of integers of F. Denote by C the rigid C-tensor
category of ﬁnite rank G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-modules.
1. Rep K  C has the relative property (T). In particular, C does not have the
Haagerup property, although for k D 2, the group G has the Haagerup property.
2. C has property (T) for all k  3.
Proof We denote by I the identity element of G D SL.k; F/. Let n 2 S .C0.G//
be a sequence of probability measures on G such that n ! ıI weakly and such
that kn ı Ad x  nk ! 0 uniformly on compact sets of x 2 G. For contradiction,
assume that kn  ıIk 6! 0. Passing to a subsequence and replacing n by the
normalization of n  n.fIg/ıI, we may assume that n.fIg/ D 0 for all n. Since
n ! ıI weakly and since there are at most k of k’th roots of unity in F, we may
also assume that n.fIg/ D 0 for all n and all k’th roots of unity  2 F.
Every n deﬁnes a state ˝n on the C-algebra L .G/ of all bounded Borel
functions on G. Choose a weak-limit point ˝ 2 L .G/ of the sequence .˝n/.
Then, ˝ induces an Ad G-invariant mean on the Borel sets of G. In particular, ˝
deﬁnes an Ad G-invariant mean ˝ on the Borel sets of the space Mn.F/ of n  n
matrices over F. By Lemma 4.5 below, ˝ is supported on the diagonal FI  Mn.F/.
Since ˝ is also supported on G, it follows that ˝ is supported on the ﬁnite set of I

C-Tensor Categories and Subfactors for Totally Disconnected Groups

where  is a k’th root of unity in F. But by construction, ˝.fIg/ D 0 for all k’th
roots of unity  2 F. We have reached a contradiction. So, kn  ıIk ! 0.
By Theorem 4.1, Rep K  C has the relative property (T). For k  3, the group
SL.k; F/ has property (T) and it follows from Theorem 4.1 that C has property (T).

The following example of [8] illustrates that G may have property (T), while the
category C of ﬁnite rank G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-modules does not.

As in [8], we get that G has property (T). Also, the center of G is isomorphic with F
(sitting in the upper right corner) and since F is non discrete, we can take a sequence
gn 2 Z .G/ with gn ¤ e for all n and gn ! e. Using the Ad G-invariant probability
measures ıgn, it follows from Theorem 4.1 that C does not have property (T).
Finally, we also include a nonamenable example having the Haagerup property.
Example 4.4 Let 2  jmj < n be integers. Deﬁne the totally disconnected compact
abelian group K D Znm as the proﬁnite completion of Z with respect to the
decreasing sequence of ﬁnite index subgroups .nkmkZ/k0. We have open subgroups
mK < K and nK < K, as well as the isomorphism ' W mK ! nK W '.mk/ D nk
for all k 2 K. We deﬁne G as the HNN extension of K and '. Alternatively, we may
view K < G as the Schlichting completion of the Baumslag-Solitar group
B.m; n/ D ha; t j tamt1 D ani
and the almost normal subgroup hai.
Since G is acting properly on a tree, G has the Haagerup property. Also, G is
nonamenable. For all positive integers k; l  0, we denote by k;l the normalized
Haar measure on the open subgroup nkmlK. Note that '.k;l/ D kC1;l1 whenever
k; l  1. Then the probability measures

sense of Deﬁnition 3.3, and they satisfy n ! ıe weakly and knıAd xnk ! 0
uniformly on compact sets of x 2 G. By Theorem 4.1, C has the Haagerup property.
Lemma 4.5 Let F be a local ﬁeld with characteristic ¤ 2. Let k  2 and deﬁne

Weak Amenability of Rigid C-Tensor Categories
Following [26, Deﬁnition 5.1], a rigid C-tensor category is called weakly amenable
if there exists a sequence of completely bounded (cb) multipliers 'n W Irr.C / ! C
(see Deﬁnition 3.2) converging to 1 pointwise, with lim supn k'nkcb < 1 and with
'n ﬁnitely supported for every n.
Recall from the ﬁrst paragraphs of Sect. 3 the deﬁnition of the tube -algebra A
of C with respect to a full family of objects in C . To every function ' W Irr.C / ! C,
we associate the linear map
' W A ! A W '.V/ D '.˛/ V
for all V 2 .i˛; ˛j/ :

32
Y. Arano and S. Vaes
We deﬁne k'kcb by viewing A inside its reduced C-algebra, i.e. by viewing
A  B.L2.A ; Tr//, where Tr is the canonical trace on A . We also consider the
von Neumann algebra A 00 generated by A acting on L2.A ; Tr/.
In the following result, we clarify the link between the complete boundedness of
' in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.2 and the complete boundedness of the map '.
Proposition 5.1 Let C be a rigid C-tensor category. Denote by A the tube -
algebra of C with respect to a full family of objects in C . Let ' W Irr.C / ! C be
any function.
Then, k'kcb D k'kcb. If this cb-norm is ﬁnite, we can uniquely extend ' to a
normal completely bounded map on A 00 having the same cb-norm.
Proof For any family J of objects, we can deﬁne the tube -algebra AJ and the
linear map J
' W AJ ! AJ. By strong Morita equivalence, we have kJ
'kcb D k'kcb
whenever J is full and we have kJ
'kcb  k'kcb for arbitrary J. Also, using standard
solutions for the conjugate equations, we get natural linear maps .i˛; ˛j/ ! .j˛; ˛i/
and they deﬁne a trace preserving -anti-isomorphism of AJ onto AJ. Deﬁning
Q' W Irr.C / ! C by Q'.˛/ D '.˛/ for all ˛ 2 Irr.C /, it follows that k'kcb D k Q'kcb
and it follows that ' extends to a normal completely bounded map on A 00 if and
only if  Q' extends to A 00.
So, it sufﬁces to prove that k'kcb D k Q'kcb and that in the case where k'kcb <
1, we can extend  Q' to a normal completely bounded map on A 00. First assume that
k Q'kcb  . Fix arbitrary objects ˛; ˇ 2 C and write 	 '
˛jˇ WD 	 '
˛jˇ;˛jˇ. We prove
that k	 '
˛jˇkcb  . Since ˛; ˇ were arbitrary, it then follows that k'kcb  .
Note that .˛ˇ; ˛ˇ/ is a ﬁnite dimensional C-algebra. Consider the following
three bijective linear maps, making use of standard solutions of the conjugate

Weak Amenability of C .K < G/
Theorem 6.1 Let G be a totally disconnected group and K < G a compact open
subgroup. Denote by C the rigid C-tensor category of ﬁnite rank G-L1.G=K/-
L1.G=K/-modules.
Then C is weakly amenable if and only if G is weakly amenable and there exists a
sequence of probability measures !n 2 C0.G/ that are absolutely continuous with
respect to the Haar measure and such that !n ! ıe weakly and k!nıAd x!nk !
0 uniformly on compact sets of x 2 G.
In that case, the Cowling-Haagerup constant .C / of C equals .G/.
In order to prove Theorem 6.1, we must describe the cb-multipliers on C in terms
of completely bounded multipliers on the C-algebra C0.G/ Ìr
Ad G.

We denote by Pol.G/ the -algebra of locally constant, compactly supported
functions on G. Note that Pol.G/ is the linear span of the functions of the form 1Ly
where y 2 G and L < G is a compact open subgroup. Also note that for any compact
open subgroup K0 < G, Pol.K0/ coincides with the -algebra of coefﬁcients of ﬁnite
dimensional unitary representations of K0. We deﬁne E .G/ D Pol.G/ as the space
of all linear maps from Pol.G/ to C. Note that E .G/ can be identiﬁed with the space
of ﬁnitely additive, complex measures on the space F.G/ of compact open subsets
of G.
When K0 < G is a compact open subgroup, we say that a map  W G ! E .G/ is
K0-equivariant if
.kxk0/ D .x/ ı Ad k1
for all k; k0 2 K0 :
Note that this implies that .x/ is Ad.K0 \ xK0x1/-invariant for all x 2 G.
As in (3.4), we associate to every x 2 G and  2 Irr.K \ xKx1/ the irreducible
object .; x/ 2 Irr.C / deﬁned as the irreducible G-L1.G=K/-L1.G=K/-module
H such that  is isomorphic with the representation of K \xKx1 on 1xK  H  1eK.
The formula
'.; x/ D dim./1 .x/./
(6.1)
then gives a bijection between the set of all functions ' W Irr.C / ! C and the set of
all K-equivariant maps  W G ! E .G/ with the property that .x/ is supported on
K \ xKx1 for every x 2 G.
Denote by P D Pol.L1.G/ ÌAd G/ the dense -subalgebra deﬁned in (3.3). We
always equip P with the operator space structure inherited from P  L1.G/ ÌAd
G. As in Sect. 5, to every function ' W Irr.C / ! C is associated a linear map
' W A ! A on the tube -algebra A of C . We now explain how to associate to
any K0-equivariant map  W G ! E .G/ a linear map 	 W P ! P. When ' and 
are related by (6.1) and  W A ! P is the -anti-isomorphism of Theorem 3.1, it
will turn out that 	 ı  equals  ı ', so that in particular, k'kcb equals k	kcb.
We will further prove a criterion for 	 to be completely bounded and that will be
the main tool to prove Theorem 6.1.
Denote  W L1.G/ ! L1.G  G/ W .F/.g; h/ D F.gh/. For every  2 E .G/,
the linear map
  W Pol.G/ ! Pol.G/ W  .F/ D . ˝ id/.F/
is well deﬁned. When  W G ! E .G/ is K0-equivariant with respect to the compact
open subgroup K0 < G, we deﬁne

We prove the following technical result in exactly the same way as [10].
Lemma 6.3 Let K0; K < G be compact open subgroups and  W G ! E .G/ a
K0-equivariant map. Let   0. Then the following conditions are equivalent.
1. 	 extends to a completely bounded map on C0.G/ Ìr
Ad G with k	kcb  .
2. 	 extends to a normal completely bounded map on L1.G/ ÌAd G satisfying
k	kcb  .
3. There exists a nondegenerate -representation  W C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G ! B.K / and
bounded maps V; W W G ! K such that
•
V.kxk0/ D .k/V.x/ and W.kxk0/ D .k/W.x/ for all x 2 G, k 2 K0 and
k0 2 K,

•

In particular, every .x/ is an actual complex measure on G, i.e. .x/ 2 C0.G/.
Proof
1 ) 3. Denote P D C0.G/ Ìr
Ad G and consider the (unique) completely
bounded extension of 	 to P, which we still denote as 	. Deﬁne the nondegener-

operators V ; W W L2.G/ ! K such that

We are now ready to prove Theorem 6.1. We follow closely the proof of [20,
Theorem A].
Proof of Theorem 6.1 We deﬁne Q.G/ as the set of all maps  W G ! E .G/
satisfying the following properties:
•
there exists a compact open subgroup K0 < G such that  is K0-equivariant,
•
for every x 2 G, we have that .x/ 2 C0.G/, .x/ is compactly supported and
.x/ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar measure,
•
k	kcb < 1.
Writing kkcb WD k	kcb, we call a sequence n 2 Q.G/ a cbai (completely
bounded approximate identity) if
•
lim supn knkcb < 1,
•
for every F 2 C0.G/, we have that n.x/.F/ ! F.e/ uniformly on compact sets
of x 2 G,
•
for every n, we have that n has compact support (i.e. n.x/ D 0 for all x outside
a compact subset of G).
If a cbai exists, we deﬁne  .G/ as the smallest possible value of lim supn knkcb,
where .n/ runs over all cbai. Note that this smallest possible value is always
attained by a cbai.
First assume that C is weakly amenable. By Proposition 5.1, we can take a
sequence of ﬁnitely supported functions 'n W Irr.C / ! C converging to 1 pointwise
and satisfying lim supn k'nkcb D .C / where 'n W A ! A as before. Deﬁne the
K-equivariant maps n W G ! E .G/ associated with 'n by (6.1).

38
Y. Arano and S. Vaes
For a ﬁxed n and a ﬁxed x 2 G, there are only ﬁnitely many  2 Irr.K \ xKx1/
such that 'n.; x/ ¤ 0. So, n.x/ is an actual complex measure on K \ xKx1
that is absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar measure (and with the Radon-
Nikodym derivative being in Pol.K\xKx1/). By Lemma 6.2, k	nkcb D k'nkcb <
1. So, n 2 Q.G/ and the sequence .n/ is a cbai with lim supn knkcb  .C /.
Thus,  .G/  .C /. Write  D  .G/1=2.
For every map  W G ! E .G/, we deﬁne
 W G ! E .G/ W .x/.F/ D ..x1/ ı Ad.x1//.F/ :
If  is K0-equivariant, also  is K0-equivariant and 	.T/ D .	.T// for all
T 2 P. So, kkcb D kkcb. Also, if .n/ is a cbai, then .n/ is a cbai.
Since  .G/ D 2 < 1 and using Lemma 6.3, we can take a cbai .n/, a
nondegenerate -representation  W C0.G/ Ì f
Ad G ! B.K / and bounded functions
Vn; Wn W G ! K as in Lemma 6.3.3 with
lim
n kVnk1 D  D lim
n kWnk1 :
Replacing n by .nCn/=2, we may assume that n D n for all n. It then follows
that both formulas
n.zy1/.F/ D h.F/.zy1/Vn.y/; Wn.z/i
and
n.zy1/.F/ D h.F/.zy1/Wn.y/; Vn.z/i
hold for all F 2 C0.G/ and y; z 2 G.
Put 
n WD n.e/. We prove that k
n ı Ad x  
nk ! 0 uniformly on compact sets
of x 2 G. To prove this statement, ﬁx an arbitrary compact subset C  G and an
arbitrary sequence xn 2 C. Deﬁne
n W G ! E .G/ W n.x/ D n.xnx/ ı Ad xn :
Since 	n.T/ D u
xn	n.uxnT/, it follows that .n/ is a cbai. Also note that for all
y; z 2 G and F 2 C0.G/, we have
n.zy1/.F/ D h..Ad xn/.F// .xnzy1/ Vn.y/; Wn.xnz/i

Therefore, limn k.Wn C W0
n/=2k1 D . So, we can choose zn 2 G such that
lim
n k.Wn.zn/ C W0
n.zn//=2k D  :
Since also lim supn kWn.zn/k   and lim supn kW0
n.zn/k  , the parallelogram
law implies that limn kWn.zn/  W0
n.zn/k D 0.
Since for all F 2 C0.G/,
n.e/.F/ D n.znz1
n /.F/ D h.F/Vn.zn/; W0
n.zn/i
and
n.e/.F/ D n.znz1
n /.F/ D h.F/Vn.zn/; Wn.zn/i ;
it follows that limn kn.e/  n.e/k D 0. This means that
lim
n kn.xn/ ı Ad xn  n.e/k D 0 :
Since the compact set C  G and the sequence xn 2 C were arbitrary, we have
proved that limn kn.x/n.e/ıAd x1k D 0 uniformly on compact sets of x 2 G.
Reasoning in a similar way with n W G ! E .G/ W n.x/ D n.xx1

satisﬁes
n.zy1/.F/ D h.F/.zy1/V0

with V0
n.y/ D .xn/Vn.xny/, we also ﬁnd that limn kn.x/  n.e/k D 0 uniformly
on compact sets of x 2 G. Both statements together imply that k
n ıAd x
nk ! 0
uniformly on compact sets of x 2 G.
We next claim that for every H 2 Pol.G/ with H.e/ D 1 and kHk1 D 1, we
have that limn k
n  H  
nk D 0. To prove this claim, deﬁne
n W G ! E .G/ W n.x/.F/ D n.x/.HF/ :
Since n.zy1/.F/ D h.F/.zy1/Vn.y/; W0
n.z/i with W0
n.z/ D .H/Wn.z/ and
because the function H 2 Pol.G/ is both left and right K0-invariant for a small
enough compact open subgroup K0 < G, it follows from Lemma 6.3 that
knkcb  kVnk1 kW0
nk1  kVnk1 kWnk1 D knkcb :

40
Y. Arano and S. Vaes
So again, .n/ and .n C n/=2 are cbai. The same reasoning as above gives us a
sequence zn 2 G with limn kWn.zn/  W0
n.zn/k D 0, which allows us to conclude
that limn kn.e/  n.e/k D 0, thus proving the claim.
Altogether, we have proved that 
n 2 C0.G/ is a sequence of complex measures
that are absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar measure and that satisfy
•
k
n  
n ı Ad xk ! 0 uniformly on compact sets of x 2 G,
•
k
n  1L  
nk ! 0 for every compact open subset L  G with e 2 L,
•

n.F/ ! F.e/ for every F 2 C0.G/.
In particular, lim infn k
nk  1. But then !n WD k

nj is a sequence of
probability measures on G that are absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar
measure and satisfy !n ! ıe weakly and k!n ı Ad x  !nk ! 0 uniformly on
compact sets of x 2 G.
By Lemma 6.3, the maps 	n extend to normal cb maps on L1.G/ ÌAd G.
Restricting to L.G/, we obtain the compactly supported Herz-Schur multipliers
L.G/ ! L.G/ W ux 7! n.x/ux
for all x 2 G ;
where n W G ! C is the compactly supported, locally constant function given by
n.x/ D n.x/.1/. So, G is weakly amenable and
.G/  lim sup
n
k	njL.G/kcb  lim sup

k	nk  .C / :
Conversely, assume that G is weakly amenable and that there exists a sequence
of probability measures !n 2 C0.G/ that are absolutely continuous with respect
to the Haar measure and such that !n ! ıe weakly and k!n ı Ad x  !nk ! 0
uniformly on compact sets of x 2 G.
Since G is weakly amenable, we can take a sequence of K-biinvariant Herz-
Schur multipliers n W G ! C having compact support, converging to 1 uniformly
on compacta and satisfying lim supn knkcb D .G/.
Denote by Pol.G/C the set of positive, locally constant, compactly supported
functions on G. Denote by h 2 C0.G/ the Haar measure on the compact open
subgroup K < G. Approximating !n, we may assume that !n D h  2
n, where
n is a sequence of Ad K-invariant functions in Pol.K/C. Deﬁne the representation
 W C0.G/ Ì f

..F//.g/ D F.g/.g/
and
..x//.g/ D .x/1=2 .x1gx/
for all F 2 C0.G/,  2 L2.G/ and x; g 2 G. We then deﬁne the K-equivariant map
n W G ! C0.G/ W n.x/.F/ D n.x/ h.F/.x/n; ni :
Since n is an Ad K-invariant element of Pol.K/ and .x/n is an Ad.xKx1/-
invariant element of Pol.xKx1/, we get that n.x/ is an Ad.K \ xKx1/-invariant

complex measure supported on K \ xKx1 and having a density in Pol.K \ xKx1/
with respect to the Haar measure. Since moreover n is compactly supported, it
follows that the functions 'n W Irr.C / ! C associated with n through (6.1) are
ﬁnitely supported.
Since k!n ı Ad x  !nk ! 0 for every x 2 G, we have that k.x/n  nk ! 0
for every x 2 G. Since !n ! ıe weakly, we have that h.F/n; ni ! F.e/ for
every F 2 C0.G/. Both together imply that 'n ! 1 pointwise.
To conclude the proof of the theorem, by Lemma 6.2, it sufﬁces to prove that
lim supn knkcb  .G/.
Since n is a K-biinvariant Herz-Schur multiplier on G, we can choose a Hilbert
space K and K-biinvariant functions Vn; Wn W G ! K such that
kVnk1 kWnk1 D knkcb
and
n.zy1/ D hVn.y/; Wn.z/i
(6.2)

Ad G

Vn W G ! L2.G/ ˝ K W Vn.y/ D n ˝ Vn.y/
and
Wn W G ! L2.G/ ˝ K W Wn.y/ D n ˝ Wn.y/ :
One checks that
n.zy1/.F/ D h..F/.zy1/ ˝ 1/Vn.y/; Wn.z/i
for all y; z and that all other conditions in Lemma 6.3.3 are satisﬁed, with kVnk1 D

and this ends the proof of the theorem.

Example 6.4 Taking G as in Example 4.4, the category C is weakly amenable with
.C / D 1. Indeed, G is weakly amenable with .G/ D 1 and the probability
measures n constructed in Example 4.4 are absolutely continuous with respect to
the Haar measure, so that the result follows from Theorem 6.1.
Taking G D SL.2; F/ as in Proposition 4.2, we get that C is not weakly
amenable, although G is weakly amenable with .G/ D 1.

Decomposable Approximations Revisited
Nathanial P. Brown, José R. Carrión, and Stuart White
Abstract Nuclear C-algebras enjoy a number of approximation properties, most
famously the completely positive approximation property. This was recently sharp-
ened to arrange for the incoming maps to be sums of order-zero maps. We show
that, in addition, the outgoing maps can be chosen to be asymptotically order-zero.
Further these maps can be chosen to be asymptotically multiplicative if and only if
the C-algebra and all its traces are quasidiagonal.

Introduction
Approximation properties are ubiquitous in operator algebras, characterizing many
key notions and providing essential tools. In particular, and central to this note, a
foundational result of Choi-Effros [10] and Kirchberg [18] describes nuclearity of a
C-algebra in terms of completely positive approximations. Precisely, A is nuclear
if and only if there exist ﬁnite dimensional algebras .Fi/ and completely positive
contractive (c.p.c.) maps

(1.2)
Some 30 years later, via Connes’ celebrated work on injective von Neumann
algebras [9], this approximation property was shown to imply a stronger version
of itself: one can always take every i to be a convex combination of contractive
order-zero maps [16]. This has proved crucial to applications to near inclusions (for
example, [16, Theorem 2.3]). In this note we observe a further improvement: every
 i can be taken to be asymptotically order zero, meaning that if a; b 2 A are self-
adjoint and ab D 0, then
lim
i k i.a/ i.b/k D 0:
(1.3)
It was known that (1.3) could be arranged under the stronger hypothesis of ﬁnite
nuclear dimension [29, Proposition 3.2] and this proved vital to various applications
(cf. [7, 21, 26, 27]).
Our proof follows the strategy in [16] by obtaining suitable factorizations of
the canonical inclusion A ,! A with respect to the weak topology; then
adjusting these to take values in A; and ﬁnally applying a Hahn-Banach argument
to get asymptotic factorizations in the point-norm topology. To do this in general,
however, we require some quasidiagonal ideas. Indeed, the main technical hurdle
is showing that if A is quasidiagonal and all traces on A are quasidiagonal in the
sense of [6], then one can take every  i to be asymptotically multiplicative (see
Theorem 2.2), while retaining the decomposition of i as a convex combination
of contractive order zero maps. This should be compared with Blackadar and
Kirchberg’s characterization of nuclear quasidiagonal C-algebras in [3] as those
with approximations (1.1) and (1.2) with  i asymptotically multiplicative.
Since all traces on nuclear quasidiagonal C-algebras in the UCT class are
quasidiagonal [24], our result improves the Blackadar-Kirchberg characterization
in this case. Cones over nuclear C-algebras are quasidiagonal [25] and satisfy
the UCT, so all their traces are quasidiagonal (though we show how Gabe’s work
[14] gives a simpler proof of this fact in Proposition 3.2). Thus we obtain our main
theorem for general nuclear A by taking an order-zero splitting A ! CA, applying
the improved approximation maps on CA, then using the quotient map CA ! A to
get back to A (see the proof of Theorem 3.1 for details).

Quasidiagonal Traces
In this note, a trace on a C-algebra means a tracial state. Write T.A/ for the
collection of all traces on A. Various approximation properties for traces were
studied in [6]; of particular relevance here is the notion of quasidiagonality for
traces.

Decomposable Approximations Revisited
47
Deﬁnition 2.1 A trace  on a C-algebra A is quasidiagonal if there exist ﬁnite
dimensional algebras Fi, tracial states tri on Fi and c.p.c. maps iW A ! Fi such that
tri ı i !  in the weak topology and
lim
i ki.ab/  i.a/i.b/k D 0
(2.1)
for all a; b 2 A. Write Tqd.A/ for the set of quasidiagonal traces of A.
When A is unital the maps i can be taken to be unital and completely positive
(u.c.p.). Theorem 3.1.6 of [6] lists several other characterizations of amenable
traces.
The main technical result of this note is the following.
Theorem 2.2 Let A be a separable and nuclear C-algebra. Then A is quasidiag-
onal and T.A/ D Tqd.A/ if and only if there exist a sequence of ﬁnite-dimensional
C-algebras .Fn/ and c.p.c. maps
A

n
! A
(2.2)
such that
1. k.n ı  n/.a/  ak ! 0 for all a 2 A;
2. every n is a convex combination of ﬁnitely many contractive order zero maps;
and
3. k n.ab/   n.a/ n.b/k ! 0 for all a; b 2 A.
Only one implication of this theorem requires much work. Indeed, if A has
approximations with properties 1–3, then A is quasidiagonal (this is an easy
implication in [3, Theorem 5.2.2]; the maps  i are approximately multiplicative
by 3, and 1 ensures that they are approximately isometric). It is equally routine to
check that all traces are quasidiagonal. Indeed, since a trace composed with an order-
zero map is a trace by [28, Corollary 4.4], and each n is a convex combination of
order zero maps, given a trace A 2 T.A/, it follows that A ı n deﬁnes a trace on
Fn. Then condition 1 ensures that .A ı n/ ı  n ! A weak.
In order to prove the reverse implication it will sufﬁce to prove a -weak version
for the canonical inclusion W A ,! A. Namely, we prove the following proposition
in the remainder of this section.
Proposition 2.3 Let A be a separable nuclear, and quasidiagonal C-algebra with
T.A/ D Tqd.A/. Then there are nets of ﬁnite-dimensional C-algebras .Fi/ and of
c.p.c. maps

such that
1. .i ı  i/.a/ ! .a/ in the -weak topology for every a 2 A;
2. i is an order zero map;
3. k i.ab/   i.a/ i.b/k ! 0 for every a; b 2 A.
With this proposition in hand we prove Theorem 2.2 by following the same steps
used to prove [16, Theorem 1.4] from the preparatory lemma [16, Lemma 1.3].
Indeed, using the notation of Proposition 2.3, ﬁrst apply Lemma 1.1 of [16] to see
that for every i there is a net of contractive order zero maps .i;W Fi ! A/ such that
i;.x/ converges -weakly to i.x/ for every x 2 Fi. We may therefore assume that
the image of i is contained in A for every i. The argument now ends with a familiar
Hahn-Banach argument, similar to the one used to prove the completely positive
approximation property of a C-algebra from the assumption that its enveloping
von Neumann algebra is semidiscrete (see [5, Proposition 2.3.8]). Brieﬂy, given
a ﬁnite subset F of A and  > 0, let K0  B.A/ be the collection of all c.p.c
maps W A ! A which factorize as A
 ! F
! A, where  is a c.p.c. map with
k .ab/   .a/ .b/k   for all a; b 2 F, and  is a contractive order zero map.
Since the identity map on A lies in the point-weak closure of K0, it lies in the point
norm closure of the convex hull of K0. As a convex combination of maps in K0 can
be factorized in the form A
 ! F
! A, where  is a c.p.c. map with k .ab/ 
 .a/ .b/k   for all a; b 2 F and  a convex combination of contractive order
zero maps, we can ﬁnd such  and  additionally satisfying k. .a//  ak <  for
a 2 F. Theorem 2.2 follows by using a countable dense subset of A to produce the
required sequence of maps.
The proof of Proposition 2.3 requires some lemmas and will ﬁrst be carried out in
the case when A is unital. We will split A into two pieces, the ﬁnite and properly
inﬁnite summands, and then handle each piece separately.1 The properly inﬁnite
case is handled by a combination of Blackadar and Kirchberg’s characterization of
NF-algebras in [3] and Haagerup’s very short proof that semidiscreteness implies
hyperﬁniteness for properly inﬁnite von Neumann algebras [15, Section 2].

properly inﬁnite if it has no ﬁnite summand.

We now follow the proof of [15, Theorem 2.2]. As M is properly inﬁnite, we
can ﬁx a unital embedding  W F ! M. Then by [15, Proposition 2.1] there exists
an isometry v 2 M such that .x/ D v.x/v for all x 2 F. If v is a unitary
(which is impossible, in general), then we’re done because Ad.v/ı is the desired -
homomorphism.Since the -strong closure of unitaries in any von Neumann algebra
is the set of all isometries (cf. [23, Lemma XVI.1.1]), the remainder of the proof
(which follows the estimates on page 167 of [15]) amounts to approximating v with
a suitable unitary.
We may assume that M is concretely represented on some Hilbert space H so
that  is a vector state, given by a unit vector  2 H . Using the identity kxk2 C

Next we deal with the ﬁnite part of A. We need the following standard
uniqueness fact. Let A be a separable nuclear C-algebra, and N a ﬁnite von
Neumann algebra. Then it is well known, though most often stated when N is a
factor (see [17] and [1] which give converse statements), or when N has separable
predual (see [11, Theorem 5]) that two -homomorphisms 1; 2 W A ! N are -
strong approximately unitarily equivalent in that there is a net of unitaries ui such
that ui1.a/u
i
! 2.a/ in the -strong topology for all a 2 A if and only if
 ı 1 D  ı 2 for all normal traces  on N. Indeed, 1 and 2 extend to normal
representations 
1 ; 
2
W A ! N that agree on traces. Since A is injective, it
is hyperﬁnite,2 so there is an increasing net of ﬁnite dimensional subalgebras .F/
that is -strong dense in A. For each , the condition that  ı 
1 jF D  ı 2j
F
for all normal traces  on N gives a unitary u with Ad.u/ ı 
1 jF D 
2 jF.
The net of unitaries .u/ witnesses the -strong approximate unitary equivalence
of 
1
and 
2
and hence also of 1 and 2.
Lemma 2.5 Let A be a separable, unital and nuclear C-algebra and assume
T.A/

topology) for every a 2 A;

2. i is a -homomorphism for every n; and
3. k i.ab/   i.a/ i.b/k ! 0 for every a; b 2 A.
Proof Recall that M has a separating family of normal tracial states. As pointed
out in the remarks preceding Lemma 2.4, on any bounded subset of M the -
strong topology agrees with the topology generated by the family of seminorms
fk  k2;g (where  runs through all normal tracial states of M). As in the proof of
Lemma 2.4, the required nets of ﬁnite dimensional C-algebras and c.p.c. maps will
ultimately be indexed by ﬁnite subsets F of A, positive numbers , and ﬁnite subsets
f1; : : : ; mg of normal tracial states of M. Moreover, the same argument found in
the proof of Lemma 2.4 shows that it sufﬁces to consider a single normal trace  (by
considering  D 1
m
Pm
iD1 i), which we ﬁx for the remainder of the proof.
Write N for .A/00. We claim it is enough to obtain ﬁnite dimensional algebras
Fi and maps  iW A ! Fi and iW Fi ! N (as opposed to iW Fi ! M) satisfying (2),
(3), and
k.i ı  i/.a/  .a/k2; ! 0:
(2.24)
For this, ﬁrst note that J D fx 2 M W .xx/ D 0g is a (closed, two-sided) ideal of M,
and therefore of the form Mp for some central projection p 2 M. Using the fact that
 is a faithful trace on both N and M.1  p/, we get that N Š M.1  p/ (extending
the identity on A=J \ A). Identifying N with this direct summand, it follows that
k.a/  ﬁn.a/k2; D 0, which proves the claim.
Being ﬁnite, N is the direct sum of a (ﬁnite) type I von Neumann algebra and
type II1 von Neuman algebra. We can therefore deal with each summand separately,
and combine the two approximations to prove the lemma. To ease the notation, we
may as well assume that N itself is type I or type II1.
First assume N is ﬁnite type I, so of the form N Š ˚iL1.Xi/ ˝ Mni for some
ni 2 N and measure spaces Xi. Write .a/ D ˚i.i/
 .a/. If the direct sum is inﬁnite
then, by normality of , .a/ is the limit in k  k2; of the ﬁnite sums ˚n
iD1.i/
 .a/,
and so it sufﬁces to prove the result when the sum N Š ˚iL1.Xi/ ˝ Mni is ﬁnite.
In this case N is a (non-separable) AF C-algebra, so given a ﬁnite subset F of the
unit ball of N and  > 0 there exists some ﬁnite dimensional C-subalgebra F  N
such that for each x 2 F, there exists a contraction yx 2 F with kx  yxk < .
Fix any conditional expectation  W N ! F (an expectation exists by Arveson’s
Extension Theorem) and note that for x1; x2 2 F
k .x1x2/   .x1/ .x2/k  kx1x2  yx1yx2k C kx1  yx1k C kx2  y2k
 4:
(2.25)
Also,  composed with the inclusion map W F ,! N is the identity on F, so that
k. .x//  xk  2 for x 2 F. Thus the required approximations exist in the ﬁnite
type I case.

case as follows.
Assume A is non-unital and T.A/ D Tqd.A/. Then by [6, Proposition 3.5.10] we
have T.QA/ D Tqd.QA/, too, where QA is the unitization of A. Hence we can ﬁnd nets of

To prove Theorem 3.1 we will apply Theorem 2.2 to the cone CA D C0.0; 1˝A
of A. We will need to know that all traces on CA are quasidiagonal for nuclear
A. While this follows from [24, Corollary 6.1],3 it is really the case that the
required statement is a recasting of the “order zero quasidiagonality result” of
[22, Proposition 3.2] used as the starting point in [24]. More generally, Gabe’s
“order zero quasidiagonality” of amenable traces [14, Proposition 3.5] can also be
expressed in this language, as set out below.
Proposition 3.2 (Gabe, cf. [14, Proposition 3.5]) Let A be a C-algebra. Then
every amenable trace on CA is quasidiagonal. In particular if A is nuclear, then all
traces on CA are quasidiagonal.
Proof It is well known that traces of the form ıt ˝A, where ıt is evaluation at some
t 2 .0; 1 and A is a trace on A, generate the Choquet simplex of traces on the cone
CA.4 Since the amenable traces on CA form a face ([19, Lemma 3.4], see also [5,
Proposition 6.3.7]) and the set of quasidiagonal traces is a weak-closed, convex
subset of T.A/ [6, Proposition 3.5.1], it sufﬁces to show that any amenable trace on
CA of the form ıt ˝ A for some t 2 .0; 1 and some trace A on A is quasidiagonal.
Note too that if ıt ˝ A is an amenable trace on CA, then A is amenable on A.
This follows from [6, Theorem 3.1.6] by checking that the tensor product functional
A on the algebraic tensor product A ˇ Aop given by A.a ˝ bop/ D A.ab/ is
continuous with respect to the minimal tensor product. Let g 2 C0.0; 1 be a positive
contraction with g.t/ D 1. Then A factorizes as
A ˇ Aop
a˝bop7!.g˝a/˝.g˝b/op
! CA ˇ .CA/op
ıt˝A
! CI
(3.2)
the ﬁrst of these maps is the tensor product of two c.p.c. maps, so contractive with
respect to the minimal tensor product, while contractivity of ıt˝A follows from the
assumption that ıt ˝ A is amenable.
At this point, if A is not unital, then we can unitize A, and A (since the unitization
of an amenable trace remains amenable). As a ﬁnal reduction, by considering the
map CA ! C0..0; t; A/ given by restriction, and then identifying C0..0; t; A/ with
CA (by rescaling), we may as well assume that t D 1. Then [14, Proposition 3.5]
gives a c.p.c. order zero map 	 W A ! Q! (where Q denotes the universal UHF
algebra and Q! its ultrapower) such that

By the correspondence between order zero maps from A and -homomorphisms

3The cone CA is quasidiagonal by [25] and satisﬁes the UCT, since it is contractible.
4That is, any trace on CA lies in the weak-closed convex hull of the speciﬁed traces.

Proof of Theorem 3.1 Let F  A be ﬁnite and  > 0. Then there is a separable
nuclear subalgebra B of A containing F. Write  W B ! A for the canonical inclusion

Let W B ! CB be the c.p.c. order zero map b 7! id.0;1 ˝ b. Notice that CB
satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 2.2: it is certainly separable and nuclear, it is
quasidiagonal by a theorem of Voiculescu [25], and all of its traces are quasidiagonal
by Proposition 3.2 (as CB is nuclear, all traces are amenable). Then there are a ﬁnite
dimensional algebra F and c.p.c maps  W CB ! F and W F ! CB such that

order zero maps (because ı

x 2 F, and k .x/ .y/k <  if x; y 2 F are orthogonal positive elements.

Remark 3.3 As with the approximations in [16], attempting to merge the approx-
imations of Theorem 3.1 with the nuclear dimension by additionally asking for a
uniform bound on the number of summands in the decompositions of ˚i as a convex
combination of order zero maps is very restrictive. By the main result of [8], such
approximations only exist for AF C-algebras.

Exotic Crossed Products
Alcides Buss, Siegfried Echterhoff, and Rufus Willett
Abstract An exotic crossed product is a way of associating a C-algebra to
each C-dynamical system that generalizes the well-known universal and reduced
crossed products. Exotic crossed products provide natural generalizations of, and
tools to study, exotic group C-algebras as recently considered by Brown-Guentner
and others. They also form an essential part of a recent program to reformulate
the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefﬁcients so as to mollify the counterexamples
caused by failures of exactness.
In this paper, we survey some constructions of exotic group algebras and
exotic crossed products. Summarising our earlier work, we single out a large
class of crossed products—the correspondence functors—that have many properties
known for the maximal and reduced crossed products: for example, they extend to
categories of equivariant correspondences, and have a compatible descent morphism
in KK-theory. Combined with known results on K-amenability and the Baum-
Connes conjecture, this allows us to compute the K-theory of many exotic group
algebras. It also gives new information about the reformulation of the Baum-Connes
Conjecture mentioned above. Finally, we present some new results relating exotic
crossed products for a group and its closed subgroups, and discuss connections with
the reformulated Baum-Connes conjecture.

Introduction
Given a C*-dynamical system .A; G; ˛/, there are two classical ways to assign a
C*-algebra to it which reﬂect important properties of the system: the universal (or
maximal) crossed product AÌ˛;u G, which is universal for covariant representations,
and the reduced crossed product A Ì˛;r G deﬁned as the image of A Ì˛;u G under
the regular representation. If A D C we recover the maximal and reduced group
C*-algebras C
u .G/ and C
r .G/ of the group G.
Recently there has been a growing interest in studying more general “exotic”
group algebras C
.G/ and crossed products A Ì˛; G which are deﬁned as
completions of the convolution algebra Cc.G/ (resp. Cc.G; A/) with respect to C*-
norms which lie between the full and reduced norms kku and kkr. For exotic group
algebras, this started with the work [4] of Brown and Guentner: given a discrete
group G and an (algebraic) ideal E in l1.G/, Brown and Guentner assign an exotic
group algebra C
E;BG.G/ by looking at representations of G that have ‘enough’ matrix
coefﬁcients in E. Later work of Okayasu [32] shows that this theory is extremely
rich: If G is a discrete group which contains the free group F2 on two generators
as a subgroup, then there are uncountably many different exotic group algebras
C
E.G/ of this type. Wiersma [36] subsequently extended the framework of Brown
and Guentner to general locally compact groups, and showed an analogous result to
Okayasu’s for the connected group SL.2; R/. Motivated by the work of Brown and
Guentner, the paper [25] of Kaliszewski, Landstad and Quigg introduced a second
construction of exotic group algebras based on the dual pairing of C
u .G/ with the
Fourier-Stieltjes algebra B.G/, and studied the connection to coactions. We shall
give a detailed introduction to exotic group algebras in Sect. 2 below and we use this
opportunity to clarify the differences between the approaches of Brown-Guentner
and of Kaliszewski-Landstad-Quigg.
Work on exotic crossed products starts also with Brown-Guentner [4] and
Kaliszewski-Landstad-Quigg [25] who both indicated ways to associate exotic
crossed-products .A; ˛/ 7! AÌ˛;E G to appropriate spaces of matrix coefﬁcients E.
The constructions of exotic group algebras of Brown-Guentner and of Kaliszewski-
Landstad-Quigg are closely related, but their constructions of exotic crossed
products are fundamentally quite different in nature; nonetheless, it was observed
later [3, 6] that both constructions are functorial in the sense that every G-equivariant
-homomorphism ˚ W A ! B between two G-algebras .A; ˛/ and .B; ˇ/ descends
to a -homomorphism ˚ ÌE G W A Ì˛;E G ! B Ìˇ;E G in a canonical way.
Such exotic crossed product functors were formally introduced by Baum, Guent-
ner, and Willett in [3] as part of a program to “ﬁx” the Baum-Connes conjecture for
computing the K-theory of crossed products. The original conjecture (in the general
version with coefﬁcients) claimed that for each system .A; G; ˛/ a certain assembly
map
asr
.G;A/ W Ktop
 .GI A/ ! K.A Ì˛;r G/

Exotic Crossed Products
63
should always be an isomorphism, where Ktop
 .GI A/ is the topological K-theory
of G with coefﬁcient A (we refer to [2] for the construction of this group and
for a discussion of the far reaching consequences for groups G that satisfy the
conjecture). Unfortunately, the conjecture is not true for all groups: the known
counterexamples are all related to the failure of G being exact in the sense of
Kirchberg and Wassermann. In order to ﬁx the conjecture, the main idea of Baum,
Guentner, and Willett was to replace the reduced crossed-product functor by the
smallest exact Morita compatible crossed-product functor .A; ˛/ 7! A Ì˛;E G. Here
Morita compatibility basically means that the construction preserves stabilisation
which is needed to construct an E-theory descent used for the construction of a
direct assembly map
asE
.G;A/ W Ktop
 .GI A/ ! K.A Ì˛;E G/I
exactness and Morita compatibility are both predicted on the level of K-theory by
the conjecture, so are natural assumptions. The new conjecture asserts that this map
is always an isomorphism. In fact, Baum, Guentner, and Willett show in [3] that
several of the known counterexamples for the original conjecture satisfy the new
conjecture and, so far, there are no known counterexamples for the reformulated
conjecture.
Motivated by the above described developments, the authors of this paper started
in [9] a more systematic study of various functorial properties of exotic crossed-
product functors .A; ˛/ 7! A Ì˛; G. Recall ﬁrst that a correspondence between two
C*-algebras A and B consists of a Hilbert B-module EB equipped with a left action
˚ W A ! L .EB/ of A on EB. In case of the universal or reduced crossed-products
Ìu or Ìr, respectively, it has been known for a long time that they are
1. functorial for generalised homomorphisms in the sense that any G-equivariant
-homomorphism ˚ W A ! M .B/ canonically induces -homomorphisms
˚ Ì G W A Ì˛; G ! M .B Ìˇ; G/;
if  D u or  D r.
2. functorial for correspondences: This means that any G-equivariant A  B
correspondence EB admits a descent EB Ì G which is an A Ì˛; G  B Ìˇ; G
correspondence and this construction preserves composition of correspondences.
3. functorial for Kasparov’s KK-theory: This simply means that there is a descent
homomorphism
j
G W KKG.A; B/ ! KK.A Ì˛; G; B Ìˇ; G/;
if  D u or  D r,
which is compatible with taking Kasparov products.
In Sects. 3–5 we give a survey of the general theory of exotic crossed products
and, in particular, the results obtained in [9] in which we give characterisations
of crossed products which enjoy strong functorial properties as described above.

64
A. Buss et al.
As a sample, it turned out that functoriality for generalised homomorphisms is
equivalent to the ideal property which asserts that for each G-invariant ideal I 
 A
the inclusion  W I ,! A descends to a faithful morphism  Ì G W I Ì G ,!
A Ì G. Similarly, functoriality for correspondences is equivalent to the projection
property which asserts that for every G-invariant projection p 2 M .A/ the inclusion
 W pAp ,! A descends to an inclusion  Ì G W pAp Ì G ,! A Ì G. Another
useful characterisation of correspondence functors is functoriality with respect to
G-equivariant completely positive maps, and as an application of this we show here
as a new result that correspondence crossed products behave well with respect to
taking tensor products with nuclear C*-algebras: If Ì is a correspondence functor,
then
.A ˝ B/ Ì˛˝idB; G Š .A Ì˛; G/ ˝ B
for any nuclear C*-algebra B. As an application, we can show that under suitable
assumptions it turns out that any crossed-product functor which is faithful in the
sense that it does not send nonzero objects to f0g must dominate the reduced crossed
product functor. This motivates the requirement that exotic crossed products lie
between the maximal and the reduced ones.
It is straightforward to see that the functors constructed by Brown-Guentner and
Kaliszewski-Landstad-Quigg (which we shall call BG-functors or KLQ-functors,
respectively) satisfy the ideal property. Moreover, all KLQ-functors are correspon-
dence functors, but a BG-functor is a correspondence functor if and only if it
coincides with the universal crossed-product functor.
It was shown in [9] that every correspondence functor admits a descent in KK-
theory. Adapting ideas of Cuntz and Julg-Valette from [11] and [23] this fact has
then been used to show that for any K-amenable group in the sense of Cuntz and for
any correspondence functor Ì, the canonical morphisms
A Ì˛;u G  A Ì˛; G  A Ì˛;r G
are KK-equivalences. In particular, this implies that for G D Fn, the free group in
n generators, n 2 N [ f1g, all of the uncountably many different exotic group
algebras C
E.Fn/ corresponding to nontrivial G-invariant ideals E 
 B.G/ are KK-
equivalent. The result would be false without the assumption that E is an ideal, and
indeed it is crucial for us that an exotic group algebra is of the form C Ì G for a
correspondence functor Ì if and only if it is of the form C
E.G/ for a G-invariant
weak-closed ideal E in B.G/.
We also report on the result that the minimal exact Morita compatible functor
ÌE coincides, at least on separable systems, with the minimal exact correspondence
functor ÌECorr, whose existence is shown in [9]. Hence our results allow one to use
the full force of Kasparov’s equivariant KK-theory for the study of the reformulated
Baum-Connes conjecture.
In the remaining sections (Sects. 6–8) we report on some new results about the
relation of crossed-product functors of a group G with crossed-product functors

Exotic Crossed Products
65
of closed subgroups H of G. Based on Green’s imprimitivity theorem we give a
procedure of restricting crossed-product functors from G to H. Conversely, given
a crossed-product functor Ì for H, we describe two different ways to assign
a crossed-product functor for G to it: one is the induced functor ÌInd  and one
is the extended functor Ìext. All these constructions preserve the ideal property
(hence functoriality for generalised morphisms) and send correspondence functors
to correspondence functors. Restriction and extension preserve exactness in general,
but this can fail for induction. After introducing the restriction, induction and
extension procedures in Sect. 6 we show in Sect. 7 that the restriction of the minimal
exact correspondence functor ÌE G
Corr of G to a closed normal subgroup N of G
always coincides with the minimal exact correspondence functor ÌE N
Corr of N.
Using results of Chabert and Echterhoff from [10] this implies that the validity of
the reformulated Baum-Connes conjecture for G always passes to closed normal
subgroups N 
 G. Another result in this direction (obtained in Sect. 6), shows that
for a cocompact closed subgroup H 
 G the induction of ÌE H
Corr to G coincides
with ÌE G
Corr.
Finally, in Sect. 8, we close this paper with some questions and remarks related
to induction, restriction and extension in connection with more general permanence
properties of the reformulated Baum-Connes conjecture. Unfortunately, so far it
seems that we have more questions than solutions!

Exotic Group Algebras
Let G be a locally compact group equipped with a ﬁxed left invariant Haar
measure. We are interested in C-algebras connected to strongly continuous unitary
representations u W G ! U .H / of G, which we call simply representations of G.
Let Cc.G/ denote the space of continuous, compactly supported, complex-valued
functions on G, which is a -algebra when equipped with the product and involution
f  g.t/ :D
Z
G
f.s/g.s1t/ ds
and
f .t/ :D .t/1f.t1/;
where  W G ! .0; 1/ is the modular function. Any representation u W G !
U .H / integrates to a -representation Qu W Cc.G/ ! L .H / deﬁned by
Qu. f/ :D

In what follows we shall usually omit the tilde in our notations, thus using the same
notation for the unitary representation u and its integrated form.
The following two completions of Cc.G/ are intimately tied to the representation
theory of G, and for this and other reasons have been widely studied.

A. Buss et al.
Deﬁnition 2.1 The universal group algebra C
u .G/ is the completion of Cc.G/ with
respect to the norm
k fku :D supfku. f/k W u a representation of Gg:
Let  W G ! U .L2.G// be the left regular representation: s./.t/ :D .s1t/. The
reduced group algebra C
r .G/ is the completion of Cc.G/ with respect to the norm
k fkr :D k. f/k:
Remark 2.2 As every C-algebra A admits a faithful nondegenerate representation
on some Hilbert space, every strictly continuous homomorphism uW G ! U M .A/
integrates uniquely to a nondegenerate -homomorphism C
u .G/
!
M .A/.
Conversely, every such homomorphism is the integrated form of a representation
of G and this universal property characterises C
u .G/ up to isomorphism.
Deﬁnition 2.3 A group algebra C
.G/ is any C-algebra completion of Cc.G/ for
a C-norm k  k such that for all f 2 Cc.G/
k fku  k fk  k fkr:
A group algebra C
.G/ is exotic if kk is not equal to either the maximal or reduced
norms.
It is perhaps not immediately clear that interesting examples exist! There have
been two recent approaches to this in the literature that we discuss below, the ﬁrst
due to Brown and Guentner [4], and the second due to Kaliszewski, Landstad, and
Quigg [24, Section 3]. We ﬁrst discuss the construction of Brown-Guentner, and
then describe theorems of Okayasu and Wiersma that show that the theory of exotic
group algebras is very rich.
Deﬁnition 2.4 Let D be a set of complex-valued functions on G. A representation
u W G ! U .H / of G is called a D-representation if there exists a dense subspace
H0 of H such that for all ; 
 2 H0, the matrix coefﬁcient
G ! C;
g 7! h; ug
i
is in D.1 Deﬁne a C-seminorm on Cc.G/ by
k fkD;BG WD supfku. f/k j u a D-representationg;
and then deﬁne C
D;BG.G/ to be the Hausdorff completion of Cc.G/ for the seminorm
k  kD;BG.
1We always assume inner products on Hilbert spaces to be linear in the second variable.

Remark 2.5
1. In the original version of their deﬁnition [4, Deﬁnition 2.2], Brown and Guentner
work only with discrete groups, but their deﬁnition extends in an obvious way
to all locally compact groups as already pointed out by Wiersma [36, Section
3]. They moreover assume that D is an algebraic ideal in the space l1.G/;
this is important for their applications. It is clear, however, that the deﬁnition
makes sense without these additional assumptions; we left them out as the extra
generality seems harmless, and is occasionally useful.
2. Let B.G/ denote the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra of G: the space of all matrix
coefﬁcients of G, which turns out to be a -algebra of bounded functions on
G for the natural pointwise operations; we will have more to say on this below.
The C-algebra C
D;BG.G/ clearly only depends on the intersection D\B.G/. It is
often convenient to pass to this intersection as it is the algebraic and topological
properties of D \ B.G/ as a subset of the algebra B.G/ that are really relevant
for the structure of C
D;BG.G/. For example, when Brown and Guentner use that
D is an ideal in l1.G/ for certain of their applications, what is really relevant is
that D \ B.G/ is an ideal in B.G/; the latter is a strictly weaker property. On the
other hand, the passage from l1.G/ to B.G/ also loses some concreteness, as it
is generally difﬁcult to tell when a given function is in B.G/.
3. The completion C
D;BG.G/ is a group C-algebra in our sense if and only if kkD;BG
dominates the reduced norm. For this, it is sufﬁcient (for example) that D contains
all compactly supported functions in B.G/.
We now turn to a natural class of examples based on decay of matrix coefﬁcients.
For p 2 Œ1; 1/, write C
p .G/ as shorthand for C
Lp.G/;BG.G/. Note that if p < q then
Lp.G/ \ B.G/ 
 Lq.G/ \ B.G/ and thus the identity map on Cc.G/ extends to a
surjective -homomorphism
C
q .G/  C
p .G/:
(2.1)
The following theorem is due to Okayasu for F2 [32] and Wiersma for SL.2; R/
[36]: it shows in particular that the construction above gives rise to many interesting
exotic group algebras.
Theorem 2.6 Say G is either the free group F2 on two generators, or SL.2; R/. Let
p > q  2. Then the canonical quotient map in line (2.1) above is not injective.
Remark 2.7
1. All the C-algebras C
p .SL.2; R// for p
2
.2; 1/ are in fact abstractly
isomorphic, as one can see by combining Wiersma’s analysis [36] with Miliˇci´c’s
description of the structure of C
u .SL.2; R// [31]. We do not know if C
p .F2/ is
abstractly isomorphic to C
q .F2/ for any distinct p; q in .2; 1/.
2. The key ingredients in the proof of Theorem 2.6 are quite deep facts from
harmonic analysis: for F2 the result relies on Haagerup’s study of C
r .F2/ in [18],
while for SL.2; R/ the proof relies on aspects of the Kunze-Stein phenomenon
[30].

68
A. Buss et al.
3. The result of Okayasu extends to all (non-amenable) discrete groups that contain
F2 as a subgroup, and conceivably to all non-amenable discrete groups. However,
Wiersma’s result certainly does not extend to all non-amenable connected groups.
Indeed for any n > 2, it follows from results of Scaramuzzi [34, Theorem
III.3.3] (see also the discussion in [19, Section V.3.3]) that if G D SL.n; R/,
then C
p .G/ D C
q .G/ for all p; q 2 .n; 1/.
Having established that many interesting exotic group algebras exist, let us turn
to the construction of Kaliszewski-Landstad-Quigg. This gives another perspective
that will be especially convenient when we come to discuss exotic crossed products.
In order to do this, we need a little more background on the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra
B.G/. Recall that B.G/ consists of all matrix coefﬁcients of G, that is, functions
 W G ! C of the form .g/ D h; ug
i for some representation u W G ! U .H /
and vectors ; 
 2 H ; note that elements of B.G/ are necessarily bounded and
continuous. Straightforward algebraic checks based on the fact that one can take
direct sums, contragredients, and tensor products of representations show that B.G/
is a -algebra under the usual pointwise operations. Note also that B.G/ is invariant
under the G-actions on functions induced by the left and right translation actions of
G on itself. For brevity, we say that a collection E of functions on G is translation
invariant if it is preserved by the actions on functions induced by the left and right
translation actions of G on itself.
There is a pairing between Cc.G/ and B.G/ deﬁned by
h f; i :D
Z
G
f.s/.s/ ds;
f 2 Cc.G/;  2 B.G/:
This clearly extends to a bilinear pairing between C
u .G/ and B.G/. Moreover, it
follows from the identiﬁcation of unitary representations of G and -representations
of C
u .G/, together with the GNS construction, that this pairing identiﬁes B.G/ with
the dual space C
u .G/0 of C
u .G/. We equip B.G/ with the norm, and also weak*
topology, coming from this identiﬁcation. See [15] for more information on B.G/.
Let now U .M .C
u .G/// be the unitary group of the multiplier algebra of C
u .G/.
There is a universal representation uG W G ! U .M .C
u .G/// deﬁned on elements
of Cc.G/ by
.uG.t/f/.s/ D f.t1s/;
. fuG.t//.s/ D f.st1/.t1/:
(2.2)
The following lemma is straightforward to check directly; it is essentially the same
as [24, Lemma 3.1].
Lemma 2.8 Let E be a subspace of B.G/, and I :D fa 2 C
u .G/ j ha; i D 0 8 2
Eg be its pre-annihilator. Then the following are equivalent:
1. E is translation invariant;
2. I is invariant under left and right multiplication by the image of G under uG;
3. I is an ideal in C
u .G/.

Exotic Crossed Products
69
Here then is the deﬁnition of Kaliszewski-Landstad-Quigg.
Deﬁnition 2.9 Let E be a translation invariant subspace of B.G/. Let IE be the pre-
annihilator of E, which is an ideal by Lemma 2.8. Deﬁne a C-algebra
C
E;KLQ.G/ :D C
u .G/=IE:
This construction actually gives rise to all exotic group algebras (and indeed to
all quotients of C
u .G/ if we do not impose further restrictions on E). To make this
statement precise, recall that for us a group C-algebra is essentially the same thing
as a C-algebra norm on Cc.G/ that dominates the reduced norm, and is dominated
by the universal norm. If k  k is such a norm, write Ekk for the elements of B.G/
that are continuous for that norm; conversely, if E is a translation invariant subspace
of B.G/, write k  kE;KLQ for the norm on C
E;KLQ.G/ restricted to Cc.G/. Let Br.G/
denote the elements of B.G/ that are continuous for the reduced norm, so Br.G/
identiﬁes canonically with C
r .G/0. It also coincides with the weak closure of
Bc.G/ WD Cc.G/ \ B.G/ in B.G/ by [24, Lemma 3.9].
Proposition 2.10 The assignments
E 7! k  kE;KLQ;
k  k 7! Ekk
deﬁne mutually inverse bijections between the set of weak-closed, proper, transla-
tion invariant subspaces of B.G/ that strictly contain Br.G/, and the set of exotic
group algebra norms on Cc.G/.
Proof Recall ﬁrst that if X is any Banach space, then taking annihilators and pre-
annihilators gives a bijective correspondence between closed subspaces of X and
weak-closed subspaces of the dual X0. Specialising this to X D C
u .G/ and using
Lemma 2.8 gives a bijective correspondence between translation invariant weak-
closed subspaces of X0 D B.G/ and closed ideals of C
u .G/. Specialising yet further
gives a bijective correspondence between the weak-closed, proper, translation
invariant subspaces of B.G/ that strictly contain Br.G/, and the closed nonzero
ideals in C
u .G/ that are strictly contained in the kernel of the canonical quotient
map C
u .G/ ! C
r .G/. The latter are clearly in bijective correspondence with
C-semi-norms on C
u .G/ that restrict to exotic group algebra norms on Cc.G/ by
associating an ideal to the corresponding quotient norm and vice versa. Following
these correspondences through gives the result.
ut
It is worth noticing that by [24, Lemma 3.14] the condition Br.G/ 
 E is
automatic, if E is a non-zero weak closed translation invariant ideal in B.G/.
For a translation invariant space D of functions on G containing Bc.G/ D B.G/\
Cc.G/ it is asserted in [24, Lemma 3.5] that C
D;BG.G/ Š C
E;KLQ.G/ if we deﬁne
E :D D\B.G/. However there seems to be a gap in the proof of [24, Lemma 3.5] and
it is not clear to us whether the conclusion of that lemma holds. So our next goal is
to clarify the relationship between the Brown-Guentner and Kaliszewski-Landstad-
Quigg constructions. We denote by P.G/ the collection of continuous positive type

70
A. Buss et al.
functions on G, which is a cone in B.G/. The following proposition is closely related
to [36, Propositions 4.1 and 4.3].
Proposition 2.11 Say D is a translation invariant subspace of the vector space
of complex-valued functions on G. Then E :D span.D \ P.G// is a translation
invariant subspace of B.G/. Moreover, the identity map on Cc.G/ extends to an
isomorphism C
D;BG.G/ Š C
E;KLQ.G/.
Proof As P.G/ is contained in B.G/, it is clear that E is a subspace of B.G/; we
must show that it is translation invariant. We will focus on the left action; the case
of the right action is similar.
For a function  W G ! C and s 2 G, write s for the left-translate deﬁned by
s W t 7! .s1t/, and s W t 7! .ts/ for the right translate. It sufﬁces to show that
if  2 P.G/ \ D and s 2 G, then s is in E. As  is in P.G/, we may write
.t/ D h; uti
for some representation u W G ! U .H / and  2 H . It follows that
s.t/ D h; us1ti D hus; uti D 1

ikhus C ik; ut.us C ik/i:
Write k.t/ D hus C ik; ut.us C ik/i; as each k is in P.G/, it sufﬁces to show
that each is in D. Note, however, that
k.t/ D hus; utusi C ikhus; uti C ikh; utusi C h; uti
D ss.t/ C iks.t/ C iks.t/ C .t/;
and so k is in D because D is translation invariant.
To see that the identity map on Cc.G/ induces an isomorphism C
D;BG.G/ Š
C
E;KLQ.G/, it sufﬁces to check that
IE D

fkernel.u W C
u .G/ ! L .H // j u W G ! U .H / a D-representationg
Say ﬁrst a 2 IE, and let u W G ! U .H / be a D-representation with associated
dense subspace H0 giving rise to a dense set of matrix coefﬁcients in D. Then for
any  2 H0, if .s/ D h; usi then  is in D \ P.G/ 
 E and we have that
h; u.a/i D ha; i D 0:
As H0 is dense, this forces h

For the converse inclusion, say a 2 C

that  is in D\P.G/. Let .u; H ; / be the GNS triple associated to , and note that
u W G ! U .H / is a D-representation: indeed, since D is translation invariant we
may take H0 D spanfus j s 2 Gg. Hence h; u.a/i D ha; i, which is non-zero,

Corollary 2.12 Let E 
 B.G/ be a translation invariant subspace of B.G/. Then
the following are equivalent:
1. E0 D span.E \ P.G// is weak* dense in E.
2. The identity map on Cc.G/ extends to an isomorphism C
E;BG.G/ Š C
E;KLQ.G/.
Proof It follows from the deﬁnition of KLQ-group algebras together with Proposi-
tion 2.10 that C
E0;KLQ.G/ D C
E;KLQ.G/ if and only if the weak closures of E0 and
E coincide. Combining this with Proposition 2.11 gives the equivalence of (1) and
(2).
ut
At the time of writing we do not know whether span.E \ P.G// is weak dense
in E for all translation invariant subspaces of B.G/, but it seems likely that there are
counter examples. The following lemma gives some results:
Lemma 2.13 Suppose E 
 B.G/ is a translation invariant subspace which satisﬁes
one of the following conditions:
1. E is closed with respect to the supremum-norm on B.G/ 
 Cb.G/.
2. E is closed in the norm on B.G/ coming from identifying B.G/ with the dual
space C
u .G/0.
3. E is weak* closed.
Then the identity map on Cc.G/ extends to an isomorphism C
E;BG.G/ D C
E;KLQ.G/.
Proof We show that in all three cases every element in E can be written as a linear
combination of positive elements in E. Having done this, all three cases then follow
from Proposition 2.11. For this let s 7! .s/ D h; us
i be a nonzero element
of E for some unitary representation u W G ! U .H /. By passing to H0 D
span.u.G// \ span.u.G/
/ and the images of ; 
 under the orthogonal projections
to H0, if necessary, we may assume without loss of generality that both vectors ; 
are cyclic vectors for u. Approximating  by elements in span.u.G/
/ and observing
that .s 7! h; us
0i/ 2 E for any 
0 2 span.u.G/
/ by translation invariance of E, it
follows from any of the conditions (1), (2), (3) that .s 7! h; usi/ 2 E, and a similar
argument gives .s 7! h

Example 2.14 The above lemma applies to E0 WD C0.G/ \ B.G/, which is closed
in B.G/ under k  k1. We do not know whether the conclusion of the above lemma
applies to Dp WD Lp.G/ \ B.G/, so we do not know whether C
p .G/ D C
Dp;BG.G/
equals C
Dp;KLQ.G/. However, if we replace Dp by Ep WD span.Lp.G/ \ P.G// we
get C
p .G/ D C
Ep;KLQ.G/.
Convention 2.15 In what follows we shall often use the notation “C
E.G/” for the
KLQ group algebra attached to E. Recall that we have C
E.G/ D C
E.G/ if E denotes
the weak closure of E in B.G/. We shall be careful to write C
E;BG.G/ whenever we
want to talk about the BG-group algebra attached to E in cases where it does not
obviously coincide with C
E.G/ by any of the above results.
Remark 2.16 It will be relevant to us that algebra properties of E are reﬂected
in coalgebra properties of C
E.G/. The basic result in this direction is due to
Kaliszewski, Landstad and Quigg [24, Corollary 3.13 and Proposition 3.16]. To
describe it, let uG W G ! U .M .C
u .G/// be the universal representation of G as in
line (2.2) above. Deﬁne the comultiplication homomorphism
ı W C
u .G/ ! M .C
u .G/ ˝ C
u .G//
to be the integrated form of the diagonal representation s 7! uG.s/ ˝ uG.s/, which
exists by Remark 2.2. Consider the following diagram, where the horizontal arrows
are induced by the canonical quotients:
Then E is a subalgebra of B.G/ if and only the rightmost dashed arrow can be ﬁlled
in; and E is an ideal in B.G/ if and only if the central dashed arrow can be ﬁlled in.
We close this section with three theorems which show that exotic group C-
algebras allow new characterisations of classical notions from non-abelian harmonic
analysis. For discrete groups, these results can be found in [4, Sections 2 and
3], although (1) if and only if (2) from Theorem 2.17 is much older, and due
to Hulanicki [21]. The general cases can be proved by slight elaborations of the
arguments given there: see also [22] for the result on the Haagerup property in the
general case.
Theorem 2.17 The following are equivalent:
1. G is amenable;
2. Cc.G/ \ B.G/ is weak dense in B.G/, i.e. C
u .G/ D C
r .G/;
3. Ep D span.Lp.G/\P.G// is weak dense in B.G/ for some p < 1, i.e. C
u .G/ D
C
p .G/.

Theorem 2.18 The following are equivalent:
1. G has the Haagerup approximation property;
2. E0 WD B.G/ \ C0.G/ is weak dense in B.G/, i.e. C
u .G/ D C
E0.G/.
The proof can be done as the proof of Corollary 3.4 in [4], where a similar
result is shown for discrete G and C
C0.G/;BG.G/. By Example 2.14 we know that
this algebra coincides with C
E0.G/. The third theorem is about property (T):
Theorem 2.19 The following are equivalent:
1. G has property (T);
2. If E is a translation invariant ideal of B.G/ such that E0 WD span.E \ P.G// is
weak dense in B.G/, then E D B.G/;
3. If E is a translation invariant ideal of B.G/ such that C
u .G/ D C
E;BG.G/, then
E D B.G/.
Proof The equivalence between (2) and (3) follows from the above discussions,
since C
E;BG.G/ D C
E0.G/ D C
E0.G/ equals C
u .G/ if and only if E0 D B.G/, where
E0 denotes the weak closure of E0.
An analogue of the equivalence between (1) and (3) has been shown for discrete
G in [4, Proposition 3.6], but with B.G/ replaced by `1.G/. The proof of the general
case follows along similar lines: Assume that G has property (T) and let E be a
translation invariant ideal of B.G/ such that C
E;BG.G/ D C
u .G/. Then there exists
a faithful E-representation u W G ! U .H /, e.g., take the direct sum of all GNS-
representations attached to elements in E \ P.G/. Then 1G is weakly contained in
u, and therefore, by property (T), 1G is a subrepresentation of u. Hence there exists
a unit vector  2 H such that us D  for all s 2 G. Since u is an E-representation,
there exists a sequence .n/ of unit vectors in H which converges to  and such that
s 7! n.s/ D hn; usni lies in E \P.G/ for all n 2 N. It follows that n ! 1G in the
norm topology of B.G/. Since B.G/ is a Banach algebra, it follows that E \ P.G/
contains an invertible element of B.G/. Thus E D B.G/.
For the converse direction we can use the same arguments as given in the proof
of [4, Proposition 3.6].

Let .A; ˛/ be a G-C-algebra, i.e. A is a C-algebra equipped with a homomor-

It will be useful for later purposes to note that this generalises to actions on
Hilbert modules and multiplier algebras in a natural way. Precisely, if E is a
Hilbert B-module then a covariant pair .; u/ for .A; ˛/ on E consists of a -
representation  W A ! L .E / from A to the adjointable operators on E , and
a (strongly continuous, unitary) representation u W G ! U .E / from G to the
group of unitary operators on E satisfying the compatibility relationship in line (3.1)
above. Regarding a C*-algebra D as a Hilbert module over itself, the isomorphism
M .D/ Š L .D/ shows that covariant representations into multiplier algebras with
strongly continuous unitary part are special cases of covariant representations on
Hilbert modules.
Analogously to the case of group algebras, the following two completions of
Cc.G; A/ have been very widely studied.

integrates to a -homomorphism

to the bounded (adjointable) operators on the Hilbert space (module) and, con-
versely, that every nondegenerate -representation  of A Ì˛;u G is the integrated

(3.2)
Analogously to the group case, an exotic crossed product is roughly a completion
of Cc.G; A/ for a norm between the maximal and reduced norms. Motivated by
both examples and applications, it seems reasonable to ask for some compatibility
between such exotic crossed products as A varies. The minimal reasonable require-
ment here seems to be compatibility with -homomorphisms (we will discuss some
stronger requirements later): to make this precise, note that if  W A ! B is a G-
equivariant -homomorphism then the function
 Ìc G W Cc.G; A/ ! Cc.G; B/;
f 7!  ı f
(3.3)
is a -homomorphism, and moreover, the assignment  7!  Ìc G is functorial.
Deﬁnition 3.2 A crossed product is an assignment to each G-C-algebra .A; ˛/ of
a completion A Ì˛; G of Cc.G; A/ for a C-norm k  k such that:
1. for all f 2 Cc.G; A/,
k fku  k fk  k fkrI
2. for any equivariant -homomorphism  W .A; ˛/ ! .B; ˇ/ the -homomorphism
 Ìc G of line (3.3) extends to a -homomorphism
 Ì G W A Ì˛; G ! B Ìˇ; G:
A crossed product is exotic if the associated norm differs from the maximal and
reduced norms (on at least one G-C-algebra each).
Thus a crossed product is a functor from the category of G-C-algebras
and equivariant
-homomorphisms to the category of C-algebras and
-
homomorphisms that sits between the universal and reduced completions in some
sense. One might wonder why we only consider completions of Cc.G; A/ by norms
kk which dominate the reduced norm kkr. We come back to this point in Sect. 4.4

A. Buss et al.
There are natural extensions of both the Brown-Guentner and Kaliszewski-
Landstad-Quigg exotic group algebra constructions to exotic crossed products. Here
is the Brown-Guentner construction.
Deﬁnition 3.3 Let C
E.G/ be a group C-algebra as in Convention 2.15, and .A; ˛/
a dynamical system. The Brown-Guentner crossed product A Ì˛;EBG G (for short:
BG crossed product) is the completion of Cc.G; A/ for the norm
k fkEBG :D supfk Ì u. f/k j .; u/ a covariant pair such that u extends to C
E.G/g:
In order to deﬁne the Kaliszewski-Landstad-Quigg construction of crossed
products, we need a little more notation. Let .A; G/ be the universal covariant
representation of .A; G/ into M .A Ì˛;u G/ as in line (3.2) above. Let uGW G !
M .C
u .G// be the universal representation of G as in line (2.2) above (that is, uG
coincides with G W G ! U M .C Ìu G/ if we identify C
u .G/ with C Ìu G). Then
the maps
A ˝ 1 W A ! M .A Ì˛;u G ˝ C
u .G//;
G ˝ uG W G ! U M .A Ì˛;u G ˝ C
u .G//
deﬁne a covariant pair for .A; ˛/ (here and throughout the rest of the paper,
“˝” denotes the spatial tensor product of C-algebras). The integrated form of
this covariant pair (which exists by the universal property of A Ì˛;u G) is a -
homomorphism
O˛ W A Ì˛;u G ! M .A Ì˛;u G ˝ C
u .G//
(3.4)
called the dual coaction associated to .A; ˛/.
Deﬁnition 3.4 Let C
E.G/ be a group C-algebra, and .A; ˛/ a dynamical system.
Let qE W C
u .G/ ! C
E.G/ denote the canonical quotient map, and let
id ˝ qE W M .A Ì˛;u G ˝ C
u .G// ! M .A Ì˛;u G ˝ C
E.G//
denote the extension of the canonical tensor product -homomorphism to the
multiplier algebras.
The Kaliszewski-Landstad-Quigg crossed product A Ì˛;EKLQ G is the completion
of Cc.G; A/ for the norm
k fkEKLQ :D k.id ˝ qE/ ı O˛. f/k:
The properties of the BG and KLQ crossed products that we will use are recorded
below. We will discuss some more properties of these functors in the next section.
Proofs of these results (in a slightly different form) and other basic facts about BG
and KLQ crossed products can be found in [3, Appendix A], [24, Section 6], and [6,
Section 5].

Exotic Crossed Products
77
Proposition 3.5 Let C
E.G/ be an exotic group algebra. The following facts hold
for the associated BG and KLQ crossed products.
1. The BG and KLQ crossed products are both functorial for equivariant -homo-
morphisms, and in particular are crossed products in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.2.
2. The correspondences E 7! ÌEBG and ÌEBG
7! .C ÌEBG G/0 are mutually
inverse bijections between the collection of all BG functors and all weak-
closed translation invariant subspaces of B.G/ that contain Br.G/. In particular,
CÌEBG G identiﬁes with C
E.G/ via a -isomorphism that extends the identity map
on Cc.G/.
3. The correspondences E 7! ÌEKLQ and ÌEKLQ 7! .CÌEKLQ G/0 are mutually inverse
bijections between the collection of all KLQ functors and all weak-closed
translation invariant ideals in B.G/ that contain Br.G/. In particular, for any
group C-algebra C
E.G/, CÌEKLQ G identiﬁes with C
hEi.G/ via a -isomorphism
that extends the identity map on Cc.G/, where hEi is the weak-closed ideal in
B.G/ generated by E.
In the next section, we will study functorial properties of the BG and KLQ
crossed products in much more detail.
We conclude this section with some rather unnatural examples that are useful for
constructing crossed products with ‘bad’ properties. For yet another construction of
exotic crossed products, see [9, Section 2.4 and Corollary 4.20].
Example 3.6 Let S be a collection of G-C-algebras. For any G-C-algebra .A; ˛/,
deﬁne a seminorm on Cc.G; A/ by
k fkS ;0 :D supfk Ìc G. f/ku W  2 MorG.A; B/ for some B 2 S g;
where MorG.A; B/ denotes the set of G-equivariant -homomorphisms A ! B. We
then deﬁne a norm on Cc.G; A/ by
k fkS :D maxfk fkr; k fkS ;0g:
If A Ì˛;S G is the associated completion, then the assignment .A; ˛/ 7! A Ì˛;S G
is a crossed product functor (see [9, Lemma 2.5]).

Properties of Crossed Products
We start this section by discussing some strong functoriality properties that a crossed
product functor can have and give some useful characterisations of these. We then
discuss some applications to K-theory computations, duality theory and tensor
products. We also discuss in Sect. 4.4 “pseudo crossed products”, which are certain
quotients of the full crossed product that do not necessarily lie above the reduced
crossed product.

78
A. Buss et al.
Before we start stating the properties of interest, we need to give a brief discus-
sion about crossed products of G-equivariant Hilbert modules and correspondences.
If .B; ˇ/ is a G-algebra and E is a Hilbert B-module, then a compatible action of G
on E is a strongly continuous homomorphism  W G ! Aut.E / such that
s.xb/ D s.x/ˇs.b/
and
hs.x/; s.y/i D ˇs.hx; yi/;
for all x; y 2 E; a 2 A and s 2 G. If .A; ˛/ 7! A Ì˛; G is an exotic crossed-product
functor we may extend this functor to equivariant Hilbert modules as follows: If
.E ; / is a G-equivariant .B; ˇ/ Hilbert module as above, then there is a well-known
canonical Cc.G; B/-valued inner product on Cc.G; E / together with a compatible
right module action of Cc.G; B/ on Cc.G; E / given by
hxjyiCc.G;B/.t/ D
Z
G
ˇs1.hx.s/jy.st/iB ds;
.x  '/.t/ D
Z
G
x.s/ˇs1.'.s1t// ds
for x; y 2 Cc.G; E / and ' 2 Cc.G; B/. If we regard Cc.G; B/ a subalgebra of
B Ìˇ; G, we obtain a norm kxk D
p
khxjxik on Cc.G; E /. The actions and inner
products then extend to the -completions so that we obtain a B Ìˇ; G-Hilbert
module E Ì; G.
If .A; ˛/ is another G-algebra, then a G-equivariant .A; ˛/  .B; ˇ/ correspon-
dence is a triple .E ; ; / in which .E ; / is a G-equivariant .B; ˇ/-Hilbert module
and  W A ! L .E / is an ˛  Ad-equivariant -homomorphism (possibly
degenerate). There is a category Corr.G/ in which the objects are G-C*-algebras and
the morphisms are equivalence classes of .A; ˛/  .B; ˇ/ correspondences, where
.E ; ; /  .E 0; 0; 0/ if there is an isomorphism .A/E

! 0.A/E 0 of Hilbert B-
modules commuting the left actions of A. Composition of correspondences is given
by taking internal tensor products
Œ.E ; ; /Œ.F; ;  / D Œ.E ˝B F;  ˝ ;  ˝ 1/:
We write Corr
WD
Corr.feg/ for the correspondence category of the trivial
group feg. Isomorphisms in the correspondence categories are precisely the Morita
equivalences, i.e. correspondences where  W A ! L .E / induces an isomorphism
A Š K .E /. Correspondence categories have been studied extensively in the
literature (e.g. see [14]), where usually the homomorphisms ˚ W A ! L .E / are
assumed to be nondegenerate. But notice that every correspondence in our sense
is equivalent to a nondegenerate correspondence, so the resulting categories are
equivalent.
Deﬁnition 4.1 Let .A; ˛/ ! AÌ˛;G be a crossed-product functor. This functor:
1. extends to generalised homomorphisms if for any (possibly degenerate) G-equi-
variant -homomorphism  W A ! M .B/ there exists a -homomorphism
 Ì G W A Ì G ! M .B Ì G/

which is given on the level of functions f 2 Cc.G; A/ by f 7!  ı f in the sense
that  Ì G. f/g D . ı f/  g for all g 2 Cc.G; B/;
2. has the ideal property if for every G-invariant closed ideal in a G-algebra A, the
inclusion map  W I ,! A descends to an injective *-homomorphism  Ì G W
I Ì G ,! A Ì G;
3. is strongly Morita compatible if for every G-equivariant .A; ˛/  .B; ˇ/ equiva-
lence bimodule .E ; /, the left action of Cc.G; A/ on Cc.G; E / given by
. Ì G. f/x/.t/ :D
Z
G
. f.s//s.x.s1t// ds
extends to an action of A Ì˛; G on E Ì; G such that E Ì; G becomes an
A Ì˛; G  B Ìˇ; G equivalence bimodule;
4. is a correspondence functor if for every G-equivariant .A; ˛/  .B; ˇ/ corre-
spondence .E ; ; /, the left action of Cc.G; A/ on Cc.G; E / above extends to
an action  Ì G of A Ì˛; G on E Ì; G such that .E Ì; G;  Ì G/ becomes
an A Ì˛; G  B Ìˇ; G correspondence;
5. has the (full) projection property if for every G-algebra A and every G-invariant
(full) projection p 2 M .A/, the inclusion  W pAp ,! A descends to a faithful
homomorphism  Ì G W pAp Ì˛; G ! A Ì˛; G;
6. has the (full) hereditary-subalgebra property if for every (full) hereditary G-in-
variant subalgebra B of A, the inclusion  W B ,! A descends to a faithful map
 Ì G W B Ì˛; G ! A Ì˛; G;
7. has the cp map property if for any completely positive and G-equivariant map
 W A ! B of G-algebras, the map
Cc.G; A/ ! Cc.G; B/;
f 7!  ı f
extends to a completely positive map from A Ì˛; G to B Ìˇ; G.
Remark 4.2 Of course, it follows from the requirements for a correspondence
functor Ì that it extends to a functor Ì W Corr.G/ ! Corr, and similarly a
functor with the cp map property extends to a functor from the category of G-C-
algebras and equivariant completely positive maps to the category of C-algebras
and completely positive maps.
We now record the relationships between these various properties. Proposi-
tion 4.3 is proved in [9, Section 3], and Theorems 4.4 and 4.5 in [9, Section 4].
Proposition 4.3 The following are equivalent for a crossed product functor:
1. the ideal property;
2. extension to generalised morphisms.

80
A. Buss et al.
Theorem 4.4 The following are equivalent for a crossed product functor:
1. strong Morita compatibility;
2. the full hereditary subalgebra property;
3. the full projection property.
Theorem 4.5 The following are equivalent for a crossed product functor:
1. being a correspondence functor;
2. the projection property;
3. the hereditary subalgebra property;
4. the cp map property;
5. having the properties in Theorem 4.4 and Proposition 4.3.
The properties of BG and KLQ functors listed below are proved in [9, Sections
4 and 5].
Example 4.6 The BG crossed product associated to a group algebra C
E.G/ always
has the ideal property. It is strongly Morita compatible if and only if it is a
correspondence functor, if and only if the canonical quotient map C
u .G/  C
E.G/
is an isomorphism.
Example 4.7 KLQ crossed products are always correspondence functors, and thus
have all the properties considered above. It is conceivable that all correspondence
functors are KLQ functors. This seems unlikely, however, partly as there is a
construction of correspondence functors that are not obviously KLQ functors: see
[9, Section 2.4 and Corollary 4.20].
On the other hand, the ideal property does not always hold, as the following
example shows.
Example 4.8 Let S consist of C0.0; 1 equipped with the trivial action, and apply
the construction of Example 3.6 for this S . Then the inclusion C0.0; 1 ! CŒ0; 1
of trivial G-algebras does not induce an injection on crossed products for any non-
amenable G.
We do not, however, know if there are strongly Morita compatible crossed
products without the ideal property (we guess the answer is yes, by an elaboration
of the above, but the details are currently elusive).
The following theorem is one of the main applications [9, Section 6] of our
correspondence functor machinery; it can be regarded as another good functoriality
property of correspondence functors.
Theorem 4.9 Say .A; ˛/ 7! A Ì˛; G is a correspondence functor. Then there
exists a descent functor Ì W KKG ! KK that agrees with Ì on objects, and
on morphisms coming from equivariant -homomorphisms.

Exotic Crossed Products
81
Moreover, if G is K-amenable, then the canonical quotients
A Ì˛;u G  A Ì˛; G  A Ì˛;r G
are KK-equivalences.
4.1
K-Theory of Exotic Group Algebras
Corollary 4.10 Let G be a K-amenable group, and let E be a translation invariant
algebraic ideal in B.G/ which contains Bc.G/ D B.G/\Cc.G/. Then the canonical
quotient maps
C
u .G/  C
E;BG.G/  C
r .G/;
C
u .G/  C
E;KLQ.G/  C
r .G/
are all KK-equivalences.
Proof Using Theorem 4.9, it sufﬁces to show that C
E;BG.G/ and C
E;KLQ.G/ are of
the form C Ì G for some correspondence functor Ì.
For C
E;KLQ.G/, let E be the weak closure of E in B.G/, which is an ideal by
weak continuity of multiplication on B.G/. Let Ì be the KLQ crossed product
functor associated to C
E;KLQ.G/. Proposition 3.5 part (3) implies that C Ì G
identiﬁes with C
E;KLQ.G/; however C
E;KLQ.G/ is clearly the same as C
E;KLQ.G/ by
deﬁnition of KLQ group algebras.
For C
E;BG.G/, let eE be the span of P.G/\E, and let F be the weak-closure of eE.
Then C
E;BG.G/ D C
F;KLQ.G/ by Corollary 2.12. As P.G/ is closed under products
in B.G/ and every element in B.G/ is a linear combination of elements in P.G/, eE
is an ideal in B.G/ and F is a weak-closed ideal. Thus the result follows from the
result for KLQ group algebras.
ut
Example 4.11 Say G
D
F2 or G
D
SL.2; R/. Then G is K-amenable, so
Corollary 4.10 implies that the uncountably many exotic group C-algebras C
p .G/
from Theorem 2.6 are all KK-equivalent.
Example 4.12 It is tempting from the above to guess that if G is K-amenable, then
all exotic group algebras (or even crossed products) have the same K-theory. This
is false: in fact any non-amenable group admits an exotic group algebra such that
the canonical quotient C
E.G/ ! C
r .G/ does not even induce an isomorphism on
K-theory. This can be achieved by setting E D Br.G/ ˚ C1, for example.
Compare also Remark 4.17 in this regard, which implies that Corollary 4.10 is
in some sense the best possible result that can be deduced about K-theory of group
algebras using our correspondence functor machinery.

82
A. Buss et al.
4.2
Duality
Deﬁnition 4.13 A crossed product functor Ì is a duality functor if there is a -
homomorphism O˛ making the diagram below commute
where O˛ is the dual coaction of line (3.4) above, and the vertical maps are the
canonical quotients.
For the proof of the following theorem see [9, Section 6].
Theorem 4.14 Correspondence functors are duality functors.
Remark 4.15 Let C
E.G/ be a group algebra as in Convention 2.15. It is not difﬁcult
to see that the associated BG crossed product is a duality functor if and only if E is
an ideal in B.G/. In particular, it follows from Example 4.6 that Theorem 4.14 is not
optimal.
Remark 4.16 Note that every duality functor Ì admits a version of Imai-Takai
duality: The homomorphism b˛ is a coaction and there is a canonical isomorphism
A Ì˛; G Ìb
˛ bG Š A ˝ K .L2.G//. We refer to [9, Section 6] for more details on
this and to [8, 26] for results which show how duality techniques combined with
Theorem 4.14 can be efﬁciently used to extend correspondence crossed-product
functors to other categories like Fell-bundles over G or partial G-actions.
Remark 4.17 If Ì is a duality functor and E is the dual space of C Ì G, thought
of as a subspace of B.G/, then C Ì G Š C
E.G/ carries a coaction of G and hence
E is an ideal of B.G/ by Remark 2.16. Combined with Proposition 3.5 part (3) and
Example 4.7, it follows that an exotic group algebra C
E.G/ is of the form C Ì G
for a correspondence functor Ì if and only if the dual space of C
E.G/ is an ideal
in B.G/.
In particular, the result of Corollary 4.10 is in some sense the optimal application
of Theorem 4.9 to computing the K-theory of exotic group algebras.
4.3
Tensor Products
As an example of an application of Theorem 4.5 that does not appear in our paper
[9], here we discuss the relationship of crossed products and spatial tensor products.
In the next section, we will apply this to discuss the relationship between general
crossed products and the reduced crossed product.

Exotic Crossed Products
83
Let Ì be a crossed product for G, which is functorial for generalised morphisms.
Let .A; ˛/ be a G-C-algebra, and let .B; id/ be a trivial G-C-algebra. Then there
is an equivariant -homomorphism A ! M .A ˝ B/ deﬁned by a 7! a ˝ 1,
and functoriality for generalised morphisms implies that this integrates to a -
homomorphism
A Ì˛; G ! M ..A ˝ B/ Ì˛˝id; G/:
(4.1)
Assume now moreover that either B or A Ì˛; G is nuclear. Then as the natural
-homomorphism B ! M ..A ˝ B/ Ì˛˝id; G/ commutes with the image of the
-homomorphism in line (4.1), our nuclearity assumptions give a -homomorphism
.A Ì˛; G/ ˝ B ! M ..A ˝ B/ Ì˛˝id; G/I
checking on generators, it is not difﬁcult to see that the image of this -homomor-
phism is in fact in .A˝B/Ì˛˝id;G, and thus we have a canonical -homomorphism
.A Ì˛; G/ ˝ B ! .A ˝ B/ Ì˛˝id; G:
(4.2)
Deﬁnition 4.18 Let .A; ˛/ 7! A Ì˛; G be a crossed product functor which is
functorial for generalised morphisms. The functor has the tensor product property
if whenever B is a trivial G-C-algebra and .A; ˛/ is a G-C-algebra such that one
of B or A Ì˛; G is nuclear, the map in line (4.2) above is an isomorphism.
Since the map in line (4.2) is always surjective the tensor product property is
equivalent to the injectivity of (4.2).
Example 4.19 The BG functor associated to a group algebra C
E.G/ has the tensor
product property. Indeed, we have already noted that BG functors are functorial for
generalised morphisms. It sufﬁces to prove that there is a faithful representation 
of .AÌ˛;EBG G/˝B that extends to .A˝B/Ì˛˝id;EBG G. Now, by deﬁnition of the BG
crossed product and the spatial tensor product, we may take a faithful  of the form
. Ì u/ ˝  for some covariant pair .; u/ for .A; ˛/ with u an E-representation,
and  a representation of B. The desired extension is then the integrated form of
. ˝ ; u ˝ id/, which is a covariant pair for A ˝ B with u ˝ id an E-representation.
Remark 4.20 If B is unital, then the discussion above makes sense without assuming
that Ì is functorial for generalised morphisms, and thus the map in line (4.2) makes
sense for any unital nuclear B. At this level of generality, the map in line (4.2) can
certainly fail to be an isomorphism, even for B D M2.C/: use the construction in
Example 3.6 with S consisting of M2.C/ equipped with the trivial representation
[9, Example 2.6].
Remark 4.21 On the other hand, the map in line (4.2) is always an isomorphism
for unital and commutative B, and always an isomorphism for B commutative if Ì
is functorial for generalised homomorphisms [9, Remark 3.7 and Lemma 3.6] (it

84
A. Buss et al.
is false for general commutative C-algebras without assuming the ideal property:
compare Example 4.8 above).
Proposition 4.22 Correspondence functors have the tensor product property.
Proof We must show that the map in line (4.2) is injective, so assume for
contradiction that x is a non-trivial element of the kernel of the map above. Then
there is a state  on B such that the slice map
1AÌ˛;G ˝  W .A Ì˛; G/ ˝ B ! A Ì˛; G
is non-zero on x. As the slice map 1A ˝  W A ˝ B ! A is an equivariant completely
positive map, the cp map property implies that it integrates to a map .1A ˝ / Ì G
on the -crossed products. This gives rise to a diagram
which commutes by checking on the dense subalgebra Cc.G; A/˝algB. As the ‘right-
down’ composition sends x to zero, and the ‘down-right’ composition does not, we
have our contradiction.

4.4
Crossed Products and the Reduced Group C-Algebra
Throughout this paper, we only consider exotic group algebras and crossed products
that dominate the reduced group algebra. Here we discuss the sort of degeneracy
that can occur if one does not do this; some of the ideas underlying this section
were pointed out to us by Joachim Cuntz.
For the purposes of this subsection only, by a pseudo-crossed product functor we
mean a functor that satisﬁes all of the conditions of Deﬁnition 3.2 except possibly
that it does not dominate the reduced crossed product norm, and that possibly the
norm kk is only a semi-norm on Cc.G; A/ for some C-algebras .A; ˛/. Similarly,
a pseudo group algebra is a C-algebra completion of Cc.G/ that satisﬁes the
conditions of Deﬁnition 2.3 except that possibly the norm k  k does not dominate
the reduced norm, and is only a semi-norm on Cc.G/. Note that the deﬁnitions of
the BG and KLQ crossed products still make sense if we allow pseudo group C-
algebras as the input, but then give rise to pseudo crossed products. Note moreover
that the deﬁnitions of functoriality for generalised morphisms, and of the tensor
product property still make sense.

Exotic Crossed Products
85
Lemma 4.23 Say Ì is a pseudo-crossed product functor that is functorial for
generalised morphisms, and such that the crossed product C0.G/ Ì; G (where
 is the left translation action) is non-zero. Then C Ì G dominates the reduced
group C-algebra.
If moreover Ì has the tensor product property, then Ì dominates Ìr.
Proof From generalised functoriality, the unit inclusion C ! M .C0.G// induces
a -homomorphism C Ì G ! M .C0.G/ Ì; G/. If C0.G/ Ì G is non-zero,
then it canonically identiﬁes with K .L2.G// (the compact operators on L2.G/), as
this is true for Ìu, and as K .L2.G// is simple. Thus M .C0.G/ Ì; G/ identiﬁes
canonically with L .L2.G//. However, it is easy to see that the composition
C Ì G ! M .C0.G/ Ì; G/ Š L .L2.G//
is the integrated form of the regular representation.
Assume now that in addition Ì has the tensor product property. Then, for any
G-C-algebra the canonical inclusion A ! M .A ˝ C0.G//, a 7! a ˝ 1 gives rise,
by generalised functoriality, to a -homomorphism
A Ì˛; G ! M ..A ˝ C0.G// Ì˛˝; G/:
On the other hand, using the ˛ ˝   id ˝ -equivariant -automorphism  of
A˝C0.G/ Š C0.G; A/ given by . f/.g/ D ˛g1. f.g// for f 2 C0.G; A/, the tensor
product property and the fact (as above) that C0.G/ Ì; G D K .L2.G// gives
M ..A ˝ C0.G// Ì˛˝; G/ Š M ..A ˝ C0.G// Ìid˝; G/
Š M .A ˝ .C0.G/ Ì; G//
Š M .A ˝ K .L2.G///:
It is not difﬁcult to check that the composed map
A Ì˛; G ! M .A ˝ K .L2.G///
is induced by an integrated form of the regular representation.

A similar argument can be used for functors without the ideal property whenever
G admits a unital C-dynamical system .A; ˛/ such that the maximal crossed
product A Ì˛;u G is simple. Indeed, say then Ì is a pseudo-crossed product. If
A Ì;˛ G is non-zero, then the canonical quotient map A Ì˛;u G  A Ì˛; G is
an isomorphism (and similarly for the reduced crossed product); hence the unit

86
A. Buss et al.
inclusion C ! A induces a commutative diagram
from which it follows that the image of
C Ì G ! A Ì˛; G
is the reduced group C-algebra. Hence C Ì G dominates C
r .G/. Such an .A; ˛/
exists whenever G is discrete and exact: indeed, one may take A D C.M/ where M
is a minimal subsystem of the Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation of G, as discussed in
[27, Sections 1.4–1.5], and apply the result of [1] combined with the fact that the
action of G on M is amenable, and thus C.M/ Ìu G D C.M/ Ìr G [5, Theorem
4.3.4]. Plausibly one could adapt such an argument to exact locally compact groups,
but the necessary ingredients seem to be missing from the literature.2 It is not known
whether an A with the above properties can exist for non exact groups G.

The Minimal Exact Correspondence Functor
One of the main motivations for considering exotic crossed products is to better
understand counterexamples to the famous Baum-Connes conjecture. The conjec-
ture, with coefﬁcients, in its original form claimed that a certain assembly map
asr
.G;A/ W Ktop
 .GI A/ ! K.A Ìr G/
should always be an isomorphism. We refer to [2] for the deﬁnition of the assembly
map and the group Ktop
 .GI A/. We will not try to summarise the conjecture here,
but note that all known failures of the Baum-Connes conjecture for groups with
coefﬁcients [20] are essentially all down to failures of exactness as in the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 5.1 A crossed product functor  is exact if for any short exact sequence
of G-C-algebras
2Added in proof: these ingredients recently appeared for second countable G in a paper of Brodzki,
Cave, and Li, arXiv.1603.01829.

Exotic Crossed Products
87
the corresponding sequence of crossed products
(5.1)
is still exact.
The universal crossed product is always exact, but infamous examples due to
Gromov [17] (and recently given quite a satisfactory treatment by Osajda and
others [33]) show that the reduced crossed product can fail to be exact for some
groups. Groups for which the reduced crossed product is exact were ﬁrst studied
by Kirchberg and Wassermann [28], who called them exact groups. The class of
exact groups includes many interesting classes of groups, such as almost connected
groups, discrete linear groups, amenable groups, and hyperbolic groups.
In the sequence in line (5.1) above, the map to B Ì G is always surjective (as its
image contains the dense -subalgebra Cc.G; B/), and the composition of the two
central -homomorphisms is zero (by functoriality). Hence the potential failures
of exactness are that the map I Ì G ! A Ì G might not be injective, and that
the kernel of the map A Ì G ! B Ì G might properly contain the image of
the map I Ì G ! A Ì G. The ﬁrst of these is just the ideal property that we
already considered in the previous section. The second however, is independent
of any of the (other) properties we have considered so far: indeed, BG crossed
products are always exact, while generally failing most of the other properties in the
previous section. On the other hand, KLQ crossed products have all of the properties
considered in the previous section, but can fail to be exact as the reduced crossed
product can fail to be exact.
Baum, Guentner, and Willett proposed to ‘ﬁx’ the Baum-Connes conjecture
(for groups, with coefﬁcients) by replacing the reduced crossed product that is
traditionally used to deﬁne the conjecture with an exotic crossed product that is
automatically exact. Indeed, there is a canonical way to construct an assembly
as
.G;A/ W Ktop
 .GI A/ ! K.A Ì G/
(5.2)
for any crossed-product functor Ì, since the original map always factors over
the K-theory K.A Ìu G/ of the universal crossed product. It is well known that
the assembly map for the maximal crossed product, which is exact, fails to be an
isomorphism in general. So the exact crossed-product functor for the reformulated
conjecture should be as close to the reduced one as possible. For compatibility with
Morita equivalences (and also to ensure the existence of a descent functor in E-
theory) they require their functor to in addition have the following property.
Deﬁnition 5.2 Let KG denote the compact operators on L2.G/ ˝ l2.N/, equipped
with the adjoint action  coming from the tensor product of the regular represen-
tation and the trivial representation on l2.N/. As for any G-C-algebra .A; ˛/, the

88
A. Buss et al.
G-C-algebras .A ˝ KG; ˛ ˝ / and .A ˝ KG; ˛ ˝ id/ are equivariantly Morita
equivalent, strong Morita compatibility of the universal crossed product can be used
to give a canonical isomorphism
.A ˝ KG/ Ì˛˝;u G Š .A Ì˛;u G/ ˝ KG
(see [9, Corollary 5.4]). A crossed product  is Morita compatible if this descends
to an isomorphism
.A ˝ KG/ Ì˛˝; G Š .A Ì˛; G/ ˝ KG:
In order to deﬁne the exotic crossed products used in the reformulations of the
Baum-Connes conjecture, note that there is a natural order on the collection of all
crossed products deﬁned by saying Ì  Ì if the identity on Cc.G; A/ extends to
a -homomorphism A Ì G ! A Ì G for all G-C-algebras A. Using an idea of
Kirchberg, Baum, Guentner and Willett prove the following theorem.
Theorem 5.3 There is a minimal exact and Morita compatible crossed product
functor ÌE with respect to the order above.
This crossed product can be used to reformulate the Baum-Connes conjecture
with coefﬁcients, asking the assembly map asE
.G;A/ of (5.2) to be an isomorphism for
all G-algebras .A; ˛/, in such a way that the reformulated conjecture has no (at time
of writing!) known counterexamples, and such that some of the counterexamples to
the old conjecture are conﬁrming examples for the reformulated conjecture.
The minimal crossed product ÌE is natural to consider here as it is in some sense
closest to the reduced crossed product, and as it does not change the conjecture
for exact groups. It also has the advantage that it does not suffer from the property
(T) obstructions to the version of the Baum-Connes conjecture deﬁned using the
universal crossed product [3, Corollary 5.7].
Using the results of Sect. 4, one can prove an analogue of this result in the setting
of correspondence functors [9, Section 8].
Theorem 5.4 There is a minimal exact correspondence functor ÌECorr with respect
to the order above.
Moreover, this functor agrees with the minimal exact Morita compatible functor
on the category of separable G-C-algebras and equivariant -homomorphisms.
Combined with the results of the previous section, this shows that one can
also use the full power of KKG theory to study the reformulated Baum-Connes
conjecture.

Restriction, Extension, and Induction to and from
Subgroups
Suppose that H is a closed subgroup of G. In this section we want to study relations
between crossed-product functors on G and crossed-product functors on H. We shall
deﬁne in particular a restriction and extension process between functors for G and
functors for H.
We start with the restriction process: Suppose that Ì is a crossed-product
functor for G and suppose that .A; ˛/ is an H-algebra. Consider the induced G-
algebra .IndG
H.A; ˛/; Ind ˛/ in which
IndG
H.A; ˛/ WD

F 2 Cb.G; A/ W ˛h.F.sh// D F.s/ 8s 2 G; h 2 H;
and .sH 7! kF.s/k/ 2 C0.G=H/

:
The G-action on IndG
H.A; ˛/ is given by  Ind ˛s.F/.t/ D F.s1t/. Now recall
Green’s imprimitivity theorem (see [14, Theorem B2] or [35]), which provides a
natural equivalence bimodule X.A; ˛/ between IndG
H.A; ˛/ ÌInd ˛;u G and A Ì˛;u H.
Let
IInd ˛; WD ker
	
IndG
H.A; ˛/ ÌInd ˛;u G ! IndG
H.A; ˛/ ÌInd ˛; G

:
By the Rieffel correspondence between ideals in IndG
H.A; ˛/ ÌInd ˛;u G and ideals in
A Ì˛;u H there is a unique ideal I˛;jH 
 A Ì˛;u H such that X.A; ˛/ factors through
an equivalence bimodule X.A; ˛/ between IndG
H.A; ˛/ ÌInd ˛; G and the quotient
A Ì˛;jH H WD .A Ì˛;u H/=I˛;jH:
(6.1)
Deﬁnition 6.1 Let Ì be a crossed-product functor for G. Then the assignment
.A; ˛/ 7! A Ì˛;jH H, with A Ì˛;jH H constructed as above, is called the restriction
of Ì to H.
Remark 6.2 By the deﬁnition of the restricted crossed-productfunctor the following
version of Green’s imprimitivity theorem holds automatically: If Ì is a G-crossed-
product functor and if ÌjH denotes its restriction to the closed subgroup H of
G, then Green’s bimodule X.A; ˛/ factors through an equivalence bimodule from
IndG
H.A; ˛/ ÌInd ˛; G to A Ì˛;jH H. Moreover, this determines the restriction ÌjH
and since Green’s imprimitivity theorem holds for both full and reduced norms (see
[14, Appendix B] for a detailed discussion and references), it follows that ÌujH D Ìu
and ÌrjH D Ìr. More generally, it follows from [7, Theorem 5.12] that if  D E is a
KLQ-crossed-product functor for G corresponding to a G-invariant ideal E 
 B.G/,
then the restriction jH is the KLQ-functor for H which corresponds to the H-
invariant ideal EH of B.H/ which is generated by EjH D ffjH W f 2 Eg.

90
A. Buss et al.
Theorem 6.3 Let Ì be a crossed-product functor for G and let ÌjH be its
restriction to H. Then the following are true:
1. .A; ˛/ 7! A Ì˛;jH H is a crossed-product functor for H.
2. If Ì has the ideal property, the same holds for ÌjH.
3. If Ì is a correspondence functor, the same holds for ÌjH.
4. If Ì is exact, the same holds for ÌjH.
Remark 6.4 Before we give the proof of the theorem, we need to say some words
about the connection of the composition  ı of two -homomorphisms  W A ! B
and  W B ! C and composition in the correspondence category Corr.
For this observe that  and  can be represented by the (nondegenerate)AB and
B  C correspondences ..A/B; / and . .B/C;  /, respectively. The assignment
sending -homomorphisms to the equivalence classes of these correspondences is
functorial, so that the composition  ı  is represented by the correspondence
..A/B ˝B  .B/C;  ˝ 1/.
Proof Suppose that  W A ! B is a -homomorphism. In order to show that it
induces a -homomorphism  ÌjH H W A Ì˛;jH H ! B Ìˇ;jH H we need to show
that the composition of the quotient map qB;jH W B Ìˇ;u H ! B Ìˇ;jH H with the
descent  Ìu H W A Ì˛;u H ! B Ìˇ;u H factors through A Ì˛;jH H.
For this we consider the following diagram in the correspondence category Corr:
It is shown in [14, Chapter 4] that the upper square of this diagram commutes (in
[14] only reduced crossed products are considered, but the same arguments work
for full crossed products as well). It follows from the deﬁnition of ÌjH that the
lower square commutes. Hence the outer square commutes as well. This implies that
the kernel JInd ÌG of the composition of the right vertical arrows in the diagram
corresponds to the kernel JÌjH H of the composition of the left vertical arrows
via the Rieffel correspondence induced from X.A; ˛/. By assumption we have
JInd ÌG 
 IInd ˛;. Since the Rieffel correspondence preserves inclusions, it follows
that JÌjH H 
 I˛;jH, hence the left vertical arrows factor through A Ì˛;jH H. This
proves (1).
Assume now that I is an H-invariant ideal of A with inclusion map  W I ! A and
let Q W A ! A=I denote the quotient map. It is well known (and trivial to check) that

the corresponding sequence
0 ! IndG
H.I; ˛/
Ind 
! IndG
H.A; ˛/
Ind Q
! IndG
H.A=I; ˛/ ! 0
is a short exact sequence of G-algebras. We then get the following commutative
diagram in Corr:
If Ì has the ideal property, IndG
H ÌG is injective. It follows from the commutativ-
ity of the upper square that ÌjH H is injective as well. Hence ÌjH also satisﬁes the
ideal property. If Ì is exact, then the commutativity of the whole diagram implies
that ÌjH is exact. This proves (2) and (4).
Finally, the commutativity of the diagram
where B is an H-invariant hereditary subalgebra of A—which makes IndG
H.B; ˛/ a
G-invariant hereditary subalgebra of IndG
H.A; ˛/—and where  W B ! A denotes the
inclusion map, implies that the hereditary subalgebra property passes from Ì to
ÌjH. By Theorem 4.9 in [9] this implies (3) and ﬁnishes the proof.
ut
As a direct consequence of the above result, we get the following well-known,
but non-trivial result (the original proof by Kirchberg and Wassermann in [29] uses
similar ideas as used in the above theorem):
Corollary 6.5 Every closed subgroup of an exact group is also exact.
Proof A locally compact group G is exact if and only if the minimal exact
correspondence functor ÌE G
Corr equals the reduced G-crossed-product functor ÌG
r .
But this implies that if H 
 G is a closed subgroup, then ÌG
r jH D ÌH
r is exact by
Theorem 6.3(4).
ut

92
A. Buss et al.
The restriction of a crossed-product functor to a subgroup also has good
properties with respect to the Baum-Connes assembly map:
Proposition 6.6 Suppose that Ì is a crossed-product functor for a second count-
able locally compact group G and let H be a closed subgroup of G. Let .A; ˛/ be
any separable H-algebra. Then the following are equivalent:
1. The assembly map asjH
.A;H/ W Ktop
 .H; A/ ! K.A Ì˛;jH H/ is an isomorphism.
2. the assembly map as
.IndG
H A;G/ W Ktop
 .G; IndG
H A/ ! K.IndG
H A ÌInd ˛; G/ is an
isomorphism.
In particular, if G satisﬁes BC for all Ì-crossed products, then H satisﬁes BC for
all ÌjH-crossed products.
Proof It is shown in [10, Theorem 2.2] that there is an isomorphism IndG
H
W
Ktop
 .H; A/ ! Ktop
 .GI IndG
H A/ which by [10, Proposition 2.3] commutes with the
assembly maps for H and G in the sense that the following diagram commutes:
where the right vertical arrow is induced from Green’s Morita equivalence. But the
arguments used in the proof of [10, Proposition 2.3] can easily be adapted to show
that the following diagram
commutes as well. This ﬁnishes the proof.
ut
In view of the above proposition it is interesting to study the question whether the
restriction of the minimal exact correspondence functor for G to a closed subgroup
H will always give the minimal exact correspondencefunctor for H, since this would
then imply that the reformulated conjecture passes to closed subgroups. We shall
show in the following section that this is indeed true whenever H is normal in G, but
we do not know the answer in general.
We are now going to construct crossed-product functors for G out of crossed-
product functors for a closed subgroup H. There are actually (at least) two
possibilities for doing this. We start with what we call the extension of a crossed-
product functor to G:

Exotic Crossed Products
93
Deﬁnition 6.7 Suppose H is a closed subgroup of G and let .B; ˇ/ 7! BÌˇ; H be a
crossed-product functor for H. Then, if .A; ˛/ is a G-algebra, we deﬁne the crossed
product A Ì˛;ext G as A Ì˛;ext G WD .A Ì˛;u G/=J with
J D \fker. Ì u/ W .; u/ 2 Rep.A Ì˛;u G/ such that  Ì ujH 2 Rep.A Ì˛; H/g:
We call Ìext the extension of Ì to G.
In other words, A Ìext G is the “largest” G-crossed product such that all
representations of A Ìext G restrict to representations of A Ì H. To get a feeling
for it observe that the extension of the universal crossed-product functor on H is the
universal crossed-product functor for G, but the extension of the reduced crossed-
product functor on H will rarely be the reduced crossed-product functor for G. In
fact, if H is amenable, it will always be the universal one.
Theorem 6.8 Let Ì be a crossed-product functor for H and let Ìext be the
extension of Ì to G. Then the following are true:
1. .A; ˛/ 7! A Ì˛;ext H is a crossed-product functor for G.
2. If Ì has the ideal property, the same holds for Ìext.
3. If Ì is a correspondence functor, the same holds for Ìext.
4. If Ì is exact, the same holds for Ìext.
Proof In all four cases, we just show that the property of interest can be reformu-
lated in terms of covariant pairs; having done this, it is then straightforward to verify
that if  has the given property, then ext also does.
For functoriality, let  W A ! B be an L-equivariant -homomorphism for some
group L. Then for given quotients AÌL and BÌL of the universal crossed products,
 Ìu L W A Ìu L ! B Ìu L descends to a -homomorphism A Ì L ! B Ì L if and
only if for every covariant pair .; u/ for .B; L/ that extends to B Ì L, the covariant
pair . ı ; u/ extends to A Ì L.
For the ideal property, let I be an L-invariant ideal in some A and Ì a crossed
product functor for L. For a nondegenerate representation  of I, let Q denote the
canonical extension to A. Note that Ì has the ideal property if and only if Q Ì u
extends to A Ì L whenever the covariant pair .; u/ integrates to a representation
of A Ì L.
To check the correspondence functor property, we work with the projection
property. Let A be an L-algebra and p an L-invariant projection in the multiplier
algebra of A. Let Ì be a crossed product. For a nondegenerate representation 
of A on a Hilbert space H , let jp denote the restriction of  to the corner pAp
acting on .p/H (where we have also used  for the canonical extension of  to
the multiplier algebra of A). Recall from [9, Corollary 8.6] that the crossed product
Ì has the projection property if and only if for any such A and p and any covariant
pair .; u/ that integrates to AÌL, the covariant pair .jp; u/ for .pAp; L/ integrates
to pAp Ì L.

94
A. Buss et al.
Finally, let
0 ! I ! A ! B ! 0
be a short exact sequence of L-C-algebras and Ì a crossed product. As we have
already considered the ideal property, it remains to characterise exactness of the
sequence
0 ! I Ì L ! A Ì L ! B Ì L ! 0
at the middle term. For a representation  of A that contains I in its kernel, let P
denote the representation of B canonically induced by . Note that the sequence
above is exact at the middle term precisely when for any representation .; u/ that
integrates to A Ì L such that  contains I in the kernel, the representation . P; u/
integrates to B Ì L.
As a sample, we give the proof of (3) and leave the other assertions to the reader.
For this let p 2 M .A/ be a G-invariant projection and let .; u/ be a covariant
representation of .A; G; ˛/ that integrates to A Ìext G. Then, by deﬁnition of Ìext,
.; ujH/ integrates to A Ì H. The projection property for Ì implies that .jp; ujH/
integrates to pApÌH, which then implies that .jp; u/ integrates to pApÌext G.
ut
We are now going to describe an alternative procedure to construct a crossed-
product functor on G from a functor Ì on a closed subgroup H of G which we
call the induced crossed-product functor. For this recall that if we start with a G-
algebra .A; ˛/ and restrict the action to H, then the induced algebra IndG
H.A; ˛/ is
G-isomorphic to A ˝ C0.G=H/ equipped with the diagonal action, where G acts
on G=H by the left-translation action  (e.g., see [12, Remark 6.1]). Then Green’s
imprimitivity theorem provides us with an equivalence bimodule X.A; ˛/ between
A Ì˛;u H and .A ˝ C0.G=H// Ì˛˝;u G. Given a crossed-product functor Ì for H
with corresponding ideal I˛; 
 A Ì˛;u H, we can consider the ideal IA˝C0.G=H/;Q in
.A ˝ C0.G=H// Ì˛˝;u G which corresponds to IA; via the Rieffel correspondence
for the bimodule X.A; ˛/. Let .A˝C0.G=H//Ì˛˝;QG denote the quotient of the full
crossed product by this ideal. Let jA W A ! M .A ˝ C0.G=H// denote the canonical
inclusion and let
qQ W .A ˝ C0.G=H// Ì˛˝;u G ! .A ˝ C0.G=H// Ì˛˝;Q G
denote the quotient map. We then introduce the following:
Deﬁnition 6.9 Let H be a closed subgroup of G and let Ì be a crossed-product
functor for H. Then the induced crossed-product functor ÌInd  for G is deﬁned as

Example 6.10 The crossed-product functor induced from the reduced H-crossed
product ÌH
r is the reduced G-crossed product ÌG
r . This is because Green’s imprim-
itivity bimodule XG
H.A; ˛/ factors through the reduced norms and the canonical
homomorphism A Ìr G ! M ..A ˝ C0.G=H// Ìr G/ is an embedding for every
G-algebra A.
In particular, if H is amenable (and in particular if H is the trivial group), we
always get the reduced G-crossed product functor by induction from the (unique)
H-crossed product functor. This also means that induction from the universal norm
does not always give the universal norm.
We have the following general properties for the induced crossed-product
functors.
Theorem 6.11 Let Ì be a crossed-product functor for H. Then the following are
true:
1. .A; ˛/ 7! A Ì˛;Ind  G is a crossed-product functor for G.
2. If Ì has the ideal property, the same holds for ÌInd .
3. If Ì is a correspondence functor, the same holds for ÌInd .
4. If Ì is exact and G=H is compact, then ÌInd  is exact as well.
Proof Exactly the same arguments as used in the proof of Theorem 6.3 show that
the assignment .A; G; ˛/ 7! .A˝C0.G=H//Ì˛˝;Q G is a functor from the category
of G-algebras into the category of C-algebras which preserves suitable versions of
the ideal property or exactness, if this holds for the given functor on H. Then similar
arguments as used in the proof of [9, Corollary 4.20] imply items (1), (2) and (3).
For the proof of (4) we consider the diagram
in which  W A ! C.G=H; A/ maps a 2 A to a  1G=H. The upper horizontal row
is exact by exactness of Ì and then the middle horizontal row is exact since the
upper half of the diagram commutes in the correspondence category (compare with
the proof of Theorem 6.3). But then a standard argument (see proof of Theorem 8.1
in [12]), using an approximate unit of C.G=H; I/ ÌQ G consisting of elements in
Cc.G; I/ 
 I ÌInd  G shows that the lower horizontal row is also exact. This ﬁnishes
the proof.

Remark 6.12 If H D feg is the trivial subgroup of G, then the (unique) G-crossed-
product functor induced from feg is just the reduced crossed-product functor (see
Example 6.10). In particular, the induced functor will not be exact if G is not exact,
which shows that a functor induced from an exact crossed-product functor does not
have to be exact in general.
Lemma 6.13 Let H be a closed subgroup of G and let Ì be a crossed-product
functor on G. Then ÌInd.jH/ D ÌC0.G=H/, where ÌC0.G=H/ is the functor constructed
from Ì by tensoring with D D C0.G=H/ as in [9, Corollary 4.20].
Proof Let .A; ˛/ be a G-algebra. Then IndG
H A is isomorphic to A˝C0.G=H/ via the
isomorphism which sends a function F 2 IndG

Corollary 6.14 Let H be a cocompact closed subgroup of G. Then
ÌInd E H
Corr D ÌE G
Corr:
Proof It follows from [9, Corollary 8.9] together with Lemma 6.13 that the functors
ÌInd.E G
CorrjH/ and ÌE G
Corr coincide. Since ÌE G
CorrjH is an exact correspondence
functor for H, it dominates ÌE H
Corr. Hence ÌE G
Corr D ÌInd.E G
CorrjH/ dominates
ÌInd E H
Corr. Since ÌInd E H
Corr is an exact correspondence functor by Theorem 6.11,
it dominates ÌE G
Corr, hence both must be equal.

Again, the above result can be used to yield the following well-known conse-
quence:
Corollary 6.15 If a locally compact group G contains an exact cocompact closed
subgroup H, then G is exact.
Proof If H is exact, then it means that ÌE H
Corr D ÌH
r is the reduced crossed-
product functor. But since the induced G-crossed-product functor from ÌH
r is ÌG
r
(see Example 6.10), it follows from Corollary 6.14 that ÌE G
Corr D ÌG
r , so G is
exact.

Normal Subgroups
In this section we want to show that if N is a closed normal subgroup of G and
if ÌE WD ÌE G
Corr denotes the minimal exact correspondence functor for G, then
the restriction ÌE jN of ÌE to N is the minimal exact correspondence functor for

N. Thus, as a consequence, it follows from Proposition 6.6 that the validity of the
reformulated version of the Baum-Connes conjecture due to Baum, Guentner, and
Willett will pass to closed normal subgroups. In order to prove the result we need
some preparations. As a ﬁrst step, we show that the minimal crossed-product functor
behaves well with respect to automorphisms of the group:
Lemma 7.1 Let ' W G ! G be an automorphism of the locally compact group
G and let ˛ W G ! Aut.A/ be an action. Let ˛' W G ! Aut.A/ be the action
˛' WD ˛ ı '1 and let ı' 2 .0; 1/ be the module of ' for the Haar measure of
G, i.e., we have
R
G  .g/ dg D ı'
R
G  .'1.g// dg for all  2 Cc.G/. Then the
mapping
˚ W Cc.G; A; ˛/ ! Cc.G; A; ˛'/I ˚. f/.g/ D ı'f.'1.g//
extends to -isomorphisms
˚u WA Ì˛;u G

! A Ì˛';u G;
˚r WA Ì˛;r G

! A Ì˛';r G;
and
˚E WA Ì˛;E G

! A Ì˛';E G:
Proof It is straightforward to check that ˚ is a -isomorphism between the dense
-subalgebras Cc.G; A; ˛/ and Cc.G; A; ˛'/ of the respective crossed products (the
entries ˛ and ˛' indicate the different operations on Cc.G; A/). To see that it extends
to an isomorphism ˚u W AÌ˛;uG

! AÌ˛';uG we just observe that we have a bijective
correspondence between covariant representations of .A; G; ˛/ and of .A; G; ˛'/
given by .; u/ 7! .; u'/ with u' WD u ı '1 such that  Ì u'.˚. f// D  Ì u. f/.
This implies that
k˚. f/ku D sup

k Ì u'.˚. f//k D sup
.;u/
k Ì u. f/k D k fku:
For the reduced crossed products recall from Deﬁnition 3.1 the construction of
the regular representation  D  Ì . ˝ 1/ of .A; G; ˛/ on the Hilbert A-module
L2.G; A/ with ..a//.g/ D ˛g1.a/.g/ for a 2 A; g 2 G and  2 L2.G; A/.
Similarly, the C-part ' of the regular representation ' D ' Ì . ˝ 1/ of
.A; G; ˛'/ is given by .'.a//.g/ D ˛'1.g1/.a/.g/. An easy computation then
shows that the unitary operator
W W L2.G; A/ ! L2.G; A/I W.g/ D

intertwines the regular representation ' with A Ì '

equivalence, the above described correspondence of covariant representations of

98
A. Buss et al.
.A; G; ˛/ and .A; G; ˛'/ sends  to ' which proves that ˚ extends to an
isomorphism of the reduced crossed products.
To see that ˚ also extends to an isomorphism
˚E W A Ì˛;E G

! A Ì˛';E G
we argue as follows: Let Q˚ W A Ì˛;u G ! A Ì˛';E G denote the surjective -
homomorphism given by composing ˚u with the quotient map
q' W A Ì˛';u G  A Ì˛';E G:
Let A Ì˛;E ' G WD .A Ì˛;u G/= ker Q˚. It is straightforward to check that
.A; ˛/ 7! A Ì˛;E ' G
is an exact correspondence functor for G, hence it must dominate A Ì˛;E G in the
sense that the identity on Cc.G; A/ induces a surjective -homomorphism
q W A Ì˛;E ' G  A Ì˛;E G:
In other words, this shows that the inverse ˚1 W Cc.G; A; ˛'/ ! Cc.G; A; ˛/
extends to a surjective -homomorphism A Ì˛';E G  A Ì˛;E G. Conversely, if
we replace ' by its inverse '1 and apply the above results to the action ˛', we
see that ˚ extends to a surjective -homomorphism A Ì˛;E G  A Ì˛';E G. This
combines to show that ˚ extends to the desired -isomorphism ˚E .
ut
We now want to extend the above result to automorphisms ' WD .'A; 'G/ of
the system .A; G; ˛/. This means that 'A W A ! A is a -automorphism of A and
'G W G ! G is an automorphism of G such that
˛'G.s/.'A.a// D 'A.˛s.a//
8s 2 G; a 2 A:
(7.1)
Note that if ˛ W G ! Aut.A/ is an action and N 
 G is a normal subgroup of
G, then every g 2 G determines an automorphism g WD .˛g; Cg/ of .A; N; ˛/
with ˛g W A ! A the given action of the element g 2 G and Cg W N ! N the
automorphism given by conjugation with g: Cg.n/ D gng1. It is well-known that
every automorphism ' of .A; G; ˛/ induces automorphisms 'u and 'r on AÌ˛;uG and
A Ì˛;r G, respectively, both extending the -isomorphism Q' W Cc.G; A/ ! Cc.G; A/

G .s//;
f 2 Cc.G; A/; s 2 G;

where ı' denotes the module of the automorphism 'G. The proof follows easily
from Lemma 7.1 and the arguments given in the proof of the following lemma in
the case of the ÌE -crossed products:

Lemma 7.2 If ' D .'A; 'G/ is an automorphism of .A; G; ˛/, then the -isomor-
phism Q' W Cc.G; A/ ! Cc.G; A/ extends to a -automorphism 'E of A Ì˛;E G.
Proof Let ˛' WD ˛ı'1
G be the action of G on A ‘twisted’ by 'G. Lemma 7.1 shows
that ˚ W Cc.G; A; ˛/ ! Cc.G; A; ˛'/ given by ˚. f/.s/ D ı'f.'1
G .s// extends to an
isomorphism ˚E W A Ì˛;E G

! A Ì˛';E G. On the other hand it follows from (7.1)
that the automorphism 'A W A ! A is ˛'  ˛ equivariant. By functoriality of ÌE it
therefore induces an isomorphism 'AÌG W AÌ˛';E G ! AÌ˛;E G given on Cc.G; A/
by sending a function f to 'A ı f. The composition 'E WD .'A Ì G/ ı ˚E is then an
automorphism of A Ì˛;E G which extends Q' W Cc.G; A/ ! Cc.G; A/.
ut
Example 7.3 We should note that the argument of the lemma works for any crossed-
product functor Ì for G such that an analogue of Lemma 7.1 holds for Ì, i.e.,
the isomorphism ˚ W Cc.G; A; ˛/ ! Cc.G; A; ˛'/ of that lemma extends to an
isomorphism ˚ W A Ì˛; G

! A Ì˛'; G. Hence it applies in particular for the full
and reduced crossed products.
But we should point out that analogues of Lemmas 7.1 and 7.2. do not even hold
for all KLQ crossed-product functors. For this let G be any non-amenable group
and let E 
 B.G  G/ be the weak closure of the ideal consisting of all coefﬁcient
functions  that are supported in a set of the form G  K, where K is a compact
subset of G. Then a unitary representation v W G  G ! U .H / integrates to the
exotic group algebra C
E.G  G/ if and only if its restriction to the second factor is
weakly contained in G. Let ' W G  G ! G  G be the ﬂip automorphism and let
v D uG ˝ G where uG denotes the universal representation of G. Then v factors
through C
E.G  G/ but v ı ' D G ˝ uG does not. Hence ' does not ‘extend’ to an
automorphism of C
E.G  G/ and the corresponding KLQ-functor fails Lemmas 7.1
and 7.2.
Lemma 7.4 Let Ì be a crossed-product functor for G and let N be a closed normal
subgroup of G. Further let .A; G; ˛/ be a G-system. Then the action  of G on
Cc.N; A/ deﬁned on the level of Cc.N; A/ by the formula
.
g . f//.n/ D ıg˛g. f.g1ng//;
where ıg denotes the module for the automorphism Cg.n/ D gng1 of N, extends to
an action  W G ! Aut.A Ì˛;jN N/.
Proof Recall that A Ì˛;jN N is deﬁned as the quotient .A Ì˛;u N/=J, where J is
the ideal in A Ì˛;u N which corresponds to the ideal
K WD ker.IndG
N A ÌInd ˛;u G ! IndG
N A ÌInd ˛; G/
via Green’s imprimitivity bimodule. Since A is a G-algebra, the induced algebra
IndG
N A is G-isomorphic to A ˝ C0.G=N/ equipped with the diagonal action
˛ ˝ , where  denotes the left-translation action. Let ˇg denote the automorphism
of .A ˝ C0.G=N// Ì˛˝;u G which is induced from the action idA ˝ g of g 2 G on

100
A. Buss et al.
A ˝ C0.G=N/, where g denotes the right translation action on C0.G=N/. Note that
ˇg exists since idA ˝ g commutes with ˛ ˝ . It follows then from functoriality
of Ì that ˇg factors through an automorphism of .A ˝ C0.G=N// Ì˛˝; G. In
particular, the kernel K of the quotient map from .A ˝ C0.G=N// Ì˛˝;u G onto
.A ˝ C0.G=N// Ì˛˝; G is ˇg-invariant. Now it is part of [13, Theorem 1] that
there is a ˇg  u
g -compatible automorphism g of X.A; ˛/. Since J corresponds to
K via the Rieffel correspondence for the bimodule X.A; ˛/, it follows that ˇg.K/
corresponds to u
g.J/ by Rieffel correspondence. Since this correspondence is one-
to-one, and since K D ˇg.K/ we also get J D 
g .J/. Thus u
g factors through
an automorphism 
g of A Ì˛;jN N.

We now turn to the problem of showing that the restriction ÌE jN of the minimal
exact correspondence functor ÌE WD ÌE G
Corr to any closed normal subgroup N of G
coincides with the minimal exact correspondence functor ÌE N
Corr for N. We need
Lemma 7.5 Let H be a closed subgroup of G and Ì a crossed-product functor on
H. Then, for any G-algebra .A; ˛/, the canonical mapping iA Ì iGjH W A Ìu H !
M .A Ìu G/ factors to a well-deﬁned -homomorphism
iext
A
Ì iext
G jH W A Ì H ! M .A Ìext G/:
If H is open in G, this map takes its image in A Ìext G.
Proof It follows from the deﬁnition of Ìext that iext

G jH is well deﬁned and it
is clear that it takes image in A Ìext G if H is open in G.

Just for the records we show as a corollary of this lemma and Theorem 6.8 that
the minimal exact correspondence functor ÌECorr enjoys the following property
for arbitrary closed subgroups which is well-known for the maximal and reduced
crossed-product functors:
Corollary 7.6 Let H be a closed subgroup of G, and let .A; ˛/ be a G-C-algebra.

that the extension ÌextE H

dominates ÌE G

Remark 7.7 It is not clear whether the homomorphism

Recall that a C0.X/-algebra is a C-algebra A equipped with a nondegenerate
-homomorphism ' W C0.X/ ! Z M .A/, where X is a locally compact space and
Z M .A/ denotes the centre of the multiplier algebra of A. Then, for each x 2 X, the
ﬁbre Ax of A over x is deﬁned as the quotient Ax WD A=Ix with Ix WD '.C0.Xnfxg//A.
For each a 2 A we get an assignment x 7! ax WD a C Ix 2 Ax, hence we may regard
A as an algebra of sections of a bundle A of C-algebras over X with ﬁbres Ax. An
action ˛ W G ! Aut.A/ is called ﬁbre-wise, if ˛g.Ix/ D Ix for all g 2 G; x 2 X and
hence the action induces actions ˛x W G ! Aut.Ax/ for each x 2 X in a canonical
way. Note that ˛ being ﬁbre-wise is equivalent to ˛ being C0.X/-linear in the sense
that ˛g.'. f/a/ D '. f/˛g.a/ for all g 2 G and f 2 C0.X/. For more information on
C0.X/-algebras we refer to [35, Appendix C].
Lemma 7.9 Suppose that ˛ W G ! Aut.A/ is a ﬁbre-wise action of G on the C0.X/-
algebra A with structure map ' W C0.X/ ! Z M .A/. Suppose further that Ì is an
exact crossed-product functor for G. Then AÌ˛;G is a C0.X/-algebra with structure
map iA ı ' W C0.X/ ! Z M .A Ì˛; G/ and ﬁbres Ax Ì˛x; G.
Proof As a composition of nondegenerate homomorphisms, iA ı ' is well deﬁned
and nondegenerate, and one easily checks on the generators of A Ì˛; G that it maps
C0.X/ into Z M .A Ì˛; G/. To see that .A Ì˛; G/x Š Ax Ì˛x; G for all x 2 X we
ﬁrst observe that for all open U

Remark 7.10 The above lemma is not true for non-exact crossed products in
general. Indeed, it is not true for the reduced crossed product of a non-exact group
G by [28, Theorem on p. 170].
As a corollary of Lemma 7.9, we get
Lemma 7.11 Suppose that Ìi, i D 1; 2, are two exact crossed-product functors

isomorphism between two C0.X/-algebras always induces isomorphisms of the
ﬁbres.

We want to apply the above result to the following example: Suppose that
N 
 G is a closed normal subgroup of G and let .B; ˇ/ be an N-C-algebra.
Then the induced G-algebra IndG

Then each ﬁbre .IndG
N B/gN identiﬁes with B via the evaluation map F 7! F.g/. It
is easy to check that the restriction of the G-action Ind ˇ to N is C0.G=N/-linear,
hence ﬁbre-wise. For the unit ﬁbre eN, it follows that the N-action on the ﬁbre
B Š .IndG
N B/eN coincides with the action ˇ W N ! Aut.B/ we started with. This
follows from the equation
.Ind ˇn.F//.e/ D F.n1/ D ˇn.F.e//;

Using this, we get
Lemma 7.12 Suppose that N is a closed normal subgroup of G and that Ìi, i D

Proof Let .B; ˇ/ be any N-algebra. Then, by assumption, we have IndG

We are now ready for the main result of this section:
Theorem 7.13 Let N be a closed normal subgroup of the locally compact group
G. Then the minimal exact correspondence functor ÌE N
Corr for N is equal to the
restriction ÌE G
CorrjN of the minimal exact correspondence functor ÌE G
Corr for G.
Proof We show that the restriction of ÌextE N
Corr to N equals ÌE N
Corr. Since ÌextE N
Corr
is an exact correspondence functor by Theorem 6.8 it dominates ÌE G
Corr. Hence the
desired equation would imply that the restriction of ÌE G
Corr to N, which is an exact
correspondence functor by Theorem 6.3, would be dominated by ÌE N
Corr. But then
they must coincide.
By Lemma 7.12 it sufﬁces to show that the restriction of ÌextE N
Corr to N coincides
with ÌE N
Corr on every G-C-algebra .A; ˛/. Let us write  WD extE N
Corr. Let
.i
A; i
C0.G=N/; i
G/ denote the canonical maps from .A; C0.G=N/; G/ into the multiplier
algebra M ..A˝C0.G=N//Ì˛˝;G/. It follows then from Lemma 7.8 that i
A Ìi
GjN
factors through a faithful -homomorphism
i
A Ì i
GjN W A Ì˛;jN N ! M ..A ˝ C0.G=N// Ì˛˝; G/:
(7.4)
On the other hand, we know from Lemma 7.5 that we have a homomorphism
.i
A ˝i
C0.G=N//Ìi
GjN W .A˝C0.G=N//Ì˛;E N
Corr N ! M ..A˝C0.G=N//Ì˛˝;G/:

104
A. Buss et al.
Since ÌjN is an exact crossed-product functor, it follows then from minimality of
ÌE N
Corr that there is a surjective -homomorphism A Ì˛;jN N ! A Ì˛;E N
Corr N.
Hence we get a chain of -homomorphisms
A Ì˛;jN N ! A Ì˛;E N
Corr N ! .A ˝ C0.G=N// Ì˛;E N
Corr N
! M ..A ˝ C0.G=N// Ì˛˝; G/;
(7.5)
in which the second homomorphism is given by functoriality for the generalised
homomorphism A ! M .A ˝ C0.G=N//I a 7! a ˝ 1. It is then easy to check on
the generators that the composition of the maps in (7.5) coincides with the faithful
map (7.4). Hence the ﬁrst morphism A Ì˛;jN N ! A Ì˛;E N
Corr N in (7.5) must be
faithful, too. Hence the result.

Some Questions
There are actually many open questions related to the study of exotic crossed
products and, in particular, the study of the minimal exact correspondence crossed-
product functor ÌE G
Corr. Many of those have been formulated and discussed in the
papers [3] and [9] and we therefore want to restrict here to questions related to
restriction, extension, and induction of functors from and to subgroups. The ﬁrst
question is quite obvious:
Question 8.1 Suppose H is a closed subgroup of the locally compact group G. Is
it always true that the restriction ÌE G
CorrjH of the minimal exact correspondence
functor ÌE G
Corr for G is equal to the minimal exact correspondence functor ÌE N
Corr
for H?
If the answer is “yes” then it follows from Proposition 6.6 that the validity of
the reformulated version of the Baum-Connes conjecture due to Baum, Guentner,
and Willett would pass from a group G to any of its closed subgroups. The previous
section gives a positive answer if H is normal in G. At an earlier stage we thought
that we have a positive answer at least for open subgroups H of G, but, unfortunately,
we found a gap in our arguments. Any progress in this direction would be very
appreciated by the authors.
To formulate our next question, we start with a lemma.
Lemma 8.2 Suppose that N 
 G is a closed normal subgroup of G and that ˛ W
G ! Aut.A/ is an action. Then there is an action E W G ! Aut.A Ì˛;E N N/ (with
ÌE N WD ÌE N
Corr) such that for each g 2 G the automorphism E
g is given on the
level of Cc.N; A/ by the formula
.E
g . f//.n/ D ıg˛g. f.g1ng//;
where ıg denotes the module for the automorphism Cg.n/ D gng1 of N.

Proof It follows directly from Lemma 7.2 applied to the automorphism g D
.˛g; Cg/ of .A; N; ˛/ that the automorphisms E
g
exist for all g 2 G and one
easily checks that g 7! E
g is a homomorphism. Since for each f 2 Cc.N; A/ the
map G 7! Cc.N; A/I f 7! E
g . f/ is continuous with respect to the inductive limit
topology on Cc.N; A/, the action E W G ! Aut.A Ì˛;E N N/ is strongly continuous.
ut
Remark 8.3 Note that there are analogous actions u W G ! Aut.A Ì˛;u N/ and
r W G ! Aut.A Ì˛;r N/ extending the action on Cc.N; A/ as in the above lemma.
These actions are known as the decomposition actions of G on the respective crossed
products by N. Indeed, if iu
N W N ! UM .A Ì˛;u N/ and ir
N W N ! UM .A Ì˛;r N/
are the canonical maps, then the pairs .u; iu
N/ and .r; ir
N/ are twisted actions in the
sense of Green [16] of the pair .G; N/ on A Ì˛;u N and A Ì˛;r N, respectively, and
we get canonical isomorphisms
.A Ì˛;u N/ Ì.u;iu
N/;u .G; N/ Š A Ì˛;u G and .A Ì˛;r N/ Ì.r;iu
N/;r .G; N/ Š A Ì˛;r G
(see [16, Proposition 1] for the full crossed products and [29, Proposition 5.2] for
the reduced case). Of course, if iE
N W N ! UM .AÌ˛;E N
Corr N/ denotes the canonical
map, then .E ; iE
N / is also a Green-twisted action of .G; N/ on A Ì˛;E N
Corr N and we
may wonder whether a similar decomposition isomorphism holds for the minimal
exact correspondence functors. Note that by [13, Theorem 1] we know that every
twisted action of .G; N/ is Morita equivalent to an ordinary action of G=N. Using
this it is not difﬁcult to extend any strongly Morita compatible crossed-product
functor for G=N to the category of twisted .G; N/-algebras (e.g., see [8, Deﬁnition
4.13]).
Thus it is natural to ask
Question 8.4 Suppose .A; ˛/ is a G-algebra and N is a normal subgroup of G. Is
there always a canonical decomposition isomorphism
.A Ì˛;E N
Corr N/ ÌE ;iE
N ;E G=N
Corr .G; N/

! A Ì˛;E G
Corr G‹
Is it at least true if G D N  H is the direct product of two closed subgroups?
Unfortunately we did not succeed in proving such result even in the case where
G is a direct product N  H.
Note that the candidate for the isomorphism in Question 8.4 can be described
on the level of functions with compact supports, but the precise description is a bit
tedious and we refer to [16, Proposition 1] for the details. In case where G D N Ì H
is a semi-direct product group, the twisted action of G=N Š H can be replaced by an
untwisted crossed product by H and the desired decomposition isomorphism should
then be given on the level of compactly supported continuous functions by
˚ W Cc.N  H; A/ ! Cc.H; Cc.N; A//I ˚. f/.h/ D f.; h/:
(8.1)

A. Buss et al.
We believe that positive answers to Questions 8.1 and 8.4 would give the
main steps for extending the permanence results for the classical Baum-Connes
conjecture as obtained in [10] to the reformulated conjecture in the sense of
Baum, Guentner, and Willett. Note that we always have ÌE N
Corr D ÌE G
CorrjN by
Theorem 7.13. If G D N  H it follows also that ÌE H
Corr D ÌE G
CorrjH. Thus in this
case the above question may be generalised to
Question 8.5 Suppose .A; ˛/ is an N  H-algebra and Ì is a crossed-product
functor for G D N  H. Let ˚ W Cc.N  H; A/ ! Cc.H; Cc.N; A// be given by
˚. f/.h/ D f.; h/. Does ˚ always extend to a -isomorphism
A Ì˛; .N  H/

! .A Ì˛N;jN N/ Ì˛H;jH H‹
The answer is positive for the full and reduced crossed products but we know
very little about the general case. Note that it follows from our Lemma 7.4 that for
any crossed-product functor Ì for G, any closed normal subgroup N 
 G, and any
G-algebra .A; ˛/ there is a twisted action .; ijN
N / of .G; N/ on A Ì˛;jN N. Hence
any crossed product functor Ì for G=N allows a decomposition crossed product
.A Ì˛;jN N/ Ì.;ijN
N
/; .G; N/. Thus we may ask:
Question 8.6 Given a crossed-product functor Ì for G is there always an associ-
ated crossed-product functor Ì for G=N such that
.A Ì˛;jN N/ Ì.;ijN
N
/; .G; N/ Š A Ì˛; G‹
It is actually not clear to us how to relate crossed-product functors for G=N to
crossed-product functors for G in a “canonical” way if G does not decompose as a
semi-direct product N Ì H.

On Hong and Szyma´nski’s Description
of the Primitive-Ideal Space of a Graph Algebra
Toke M. Carlsen and Aidan Sims
Abstract In 2004, Hong and Szyma´nski produced a complete description of the
primitive-ideal space of the C-algebra of a directed graph. This article details
a slightly different approach, in the simpler context of row-ﬁnite graphs with no
sources, obtaining an explicit description of the ideal lattice of a graph algebra.

Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to present a new exposition, in a somewhat simpler
setting, of Hong and Szyma´nski’s description of the primitive-ideal space of a graph
C-algebra. Their analysis [7] relates the primitive ideals of C.E/ to the maximal
tails T of E—subsets of the vertex set satisfying three elementary combinatorial
conditions (see page 111). In previous work with Bates and Raeburn, Hong and
Szyma´nski had already studied the primitive ideals of C.E/ that are invariant
for its gauge action. Speciﬁcally, [1, Theorem 4.7] shows that the gauge-invariant
primitive ideals of C.E/ come in two ﬂavours: those indexed by maximal tails
in which every cycle has an entrance; and those indexed by breaking vertices,
which receive inﬁnitely many edges in E, but only ﬁnitely many in the maximal
tail that they generate. Hong and Szyma´nski completed this list by showing in
[7, Theorem 2.10] that the non-gauge-invariant primitive ideals are indexed by pairs
consisting of a maximal tail containing a cycle with no entrance, and a complex
number of modulus 1.
The bulk of the work in [7] then went into the description of the Jacobson,
or hull-kernel, topology on Prim C.E/ in terms of the indexing set described in
the preceding paragraph. Theorem 3.4 of [7] describes the closure of a subset
of Prim C.E/ in terms of the combinatorial data of maximal tails and breaking

vertices, and the usual topology on the circle T. (Gabe [6] subsequently pointed out
and corrected a mistake in [7, Theorem 3.4], but there is no discrepancy for row-
ﬁnite graphs with no sources.) The technical details and notation involved even in
the statement of this theorem are formidable, with the upshot that applying Hong and
Szyma´nski’s result requires discussion of a fair amount of background and notation.
This is due to some extent to the complications introduced by inﬁnite receivers in
the graph (to see this, compare [7, Theorem 3.4] with the corresponding statement
[7, Corollary 3.5] for row-ﬁnite graphs). But it is also caused in part by the numerous
cases involved in describing how the different ﬂavours of primitive ideals described
in the preceding paragraph relate to one another topologically.
Here we restrict attention to the class of row-ﬁnite graphs with no sources
originally considered in [2, 9, 10]; it is a well-known principal that results tend
to be cleaner in this context. The C-algebra of an arbitrary graph E is a full
corner of the C-algebra of a row-ﬁnite graph Eds with no sources, called a Drinen–
Tomforde desingularisation E [5], so in principal our results combined with the
Rieffel correspondence can be used to describe the primitive-ideal space and the
ideal lattice of any graph C-algebra. But in practice there is serious book-keeping
hidden in this innocuous-sounding statement.
We take a somewhat different approach than Hong and Szyma´nski. We start,
as they do, by identifying all the primitive ideals (Theorem 3.7)—though we take
a slightly different route to the result. Our next step is to state precisely when a
given primitive ideal in our list belongs to the closure of some other set of primitive
ideals (Theorem 4.1). We could then describe the closure operation along the lines
of Hong and Szymanski’s result, but here our approach diverges from theirs. We
describe a list of (not necessarily primitive) ideals JH;U of C.E/ indexed by ideal
pairs, consisting of a saturated hereditary set H and an assignment U of a proper
open subset of the circle to every cycle with no entrance in the complement of H.
We describe each JH;U concretely by providing a family of generators. We prove that
the map .H; U/ 7! JH;U is a bijection between ideal pairs and ideals, and describe
the inverse assignment (Theorem 5.1). Finally, in Theorem 6.1, we describe the
containment relation and the intersection and join operations on primitive ideals in
terms of a partial ordering and a meet and a join operation on ideal pairs.
One can recover the closure of a subset X

 Prim C.E/, and so Hong
and Szyma´nski’s result, either by using the characterisation of points in X from
Theorem 4.1, or by computing T X using Theorem 6.1 and listing all the primitive
ideals that contain this intersection. To aid in doing the latter, we single out the ideal
pairs that correspond to primitive ideals (Remark 5.3), and identify when a given
JH;U is contained in a given primitive ideal (Lemma 5.2).
We hope that this presentation of the ideal structure of C.E/ when E is row-
ﬁnite with no sources will provide a useful and gentle introduction to Hong and
Szyma´nski’s beautiful result for arbitrary graphs; and in particular that it will be
helpful to readers familiar with the usual listing of gauge-invariant ideals using
saturated hereditary sets.

1.1
Background
We assume familiarity with Raeburn’s monograph [12] and take most of our notation
and conventions from there. We have made an effort not to assume any further
background.
We deal with row-ﬁnite directed graphs E with no sources; these consist of
countable sets E0, E1 and maps r; s W E1 ! E0 such that r is surjective and
ﬁnite-to-one. A Cuntz–Krieger family consists of projections f pv W v 2 E0g and
partial isometries fse W e 2 E1g such that s
e se D ps.e/ and pv D P
r.e/Dv ses
e . We
will use the convention where, for example, for v 2 E0 the notation vE1 means
fe 2 E1 W r.e/ D vg. A path of length n > 0 is a string  D e1 : : : en of edges
where s.ei/ D r.eiC1/, and En denotes the collection of paths of length n. We write
E for the collection of all ﬁnite paths (including the vertices, regarded as paths of
length 0), and set vE WD f 2 E W r./ D vg, Ew WD f 2 E W s./ D wg and
vEw D vE \ Ew when v; w 2 E0.
2
Inﬁnite Paths and Maximal Tails
Our ﬁrst order of business is to relate maximal tails in a graph with the shift-tail
equivalence classes of inﬁnite paths (see also [8]).
Recall that a maximal tail in E0 is a set T 
 E0 such that:
(T1)
if e 2 E1 and s.e/ 2 T, then r.e/ 2 T;
(T2)
if v 2 T then there is at least one e 2 vE1 such that s.e/ 2 T; and
(T3)
if v; w 2 T then there exist  2 vE and  2 wE such that s./ D s./ 2 T.
If T is a maximal tail, there is a subgraph ET of E with vertices T and edges
E1T WD fe 2 E1 W s.e/ 2 Tg.
An inﬁnite path in E is a string x D e1e2e3    of edges such that s.ei/ D r.eiC1/
for all i. We let r.x/ WD r.e1/. Two inﬁnite paths x and y are shift-tail equivalent if
there exist m; n 2 N such that
xiCm D yiCn
for all i 2 N:
This shift-tail equivalence is (as the name suggests) an equivalence relation, and we
write Œx for the equivalence class of an inﬁnite path x.
Shift-tail equivalence classes Œx of inﬁnite paths correspond naturally to irre-
ducible representations of C.E/ (see Lemma 3.2). However, the corresponding
primitive ideals depend not on Œx, but only on the maximal tail consisting of vertices
that are the range of an inﬁnite path in Œx. The next lemma describes the relationship
between shift-tail equivalence classes of inﬁnite paths and maximal tails.
Lemma 2.1 Let E be a row-ﬁnite graph with no sources. A set T 
 E0 is a maximal
tail if and only if there exists x 2 E1 such that T D Œx0 WD fr.y/ W y 2 Œxg.

112
T.M. Carlsen and A. Sims
Proof First suppose that T is a maximal tail. List T D .v1; v2; : : : /. Set 1 D 1 D
v1 2 E, and then inductively, having chosen i1 2 vi2E and i1 2 vi1E
with s.i1/ D s./, use (T3) to ﬁnd i 2 vi1E and i 2 viE such that s.i/ D
s.i/ 2 T. We obtain an inﬁnite path x D 123    . Since each iiC1iC2   
belongs to Œx, we have T 
 Œx0. For the reverse containment, observe that if v 2
Œx0, then there exists y 2 Œx such that v D r.y1/. By deﬁnition of Œx there are m; i
such that s.ym/ D s.i/. Since i 2 T, m applications of (T1) give r.y1/ 2 T.
ut
We divide the maximal tails in E into two sorts. Those which have a cycle with
no entrance, and those which don’t. The main point is that, as pointed out in [7],
if T contains a cycle without an entrance, then it contains just one of them, and is
completely determined by this cycle.
A cycle in a graph E is a path  D 1 : : : n 2 E such that r.1/ D s.n/ and
s.i/ 6D s.j/ whenever i 6D j. Each cycle  determines an inﬁnite path 1 WD
    and hence a maximal tail T WD Œ10; it is straightforward to check that
T D fr./ W  2 Er./g:
Given a cycle  2 E and a subset A of E0 that contains fr.i/ W i  jjg, we
say that  is a cycle with no entrance in A if fe 2 r.i/E1 W s.e/ 2 Ag D fig for
each 1  i  jj.
Lemma 2.2 Let E be a row-ﬁnite graph with no sources. Suppose that T 
 E0 is a
maximal tail. Then either
a) there is a cycle  with no entrance in T such that T D T, and this  is unique
up to cyclic permutation of its edges; or
b) there is no cycle  with no entrance in T.
Proof Suppose that there is a cycle  with no entrance in T. Lemma 2.1 implies
that T D Œx0 for some inﬁnite path x. So there exists y 2 Œx such that r.y/ D r./,
and since shift-tail equivalence is an equivalence relation, we then have T D Œy0.
Since  has no entrance in T, the only element of E1 lying entirely within T and
with range r./ is 1. So y D 1, and T D Œ10 D T.
If  is another cycle with no entrance in T D T then r./Er./ 6D ;, say
 2 r./Er./. Since  has no entrance in T, we have  D 1
1    1

for some
k. In particular 1

k
D , and we deduce that  D i    jj1    i1,
where i  k C 1 .mod jj/.
ut
We call a maximal tail T satisfying (a) in Lemma 2.2 a cyclic maximal tail
and write Per.T/ WD jj. We call a maximal tail T satisfying (b) in Lemma 2.2
a aperiodic maximal tail, and deﬁne Per.T/ WD 0.

The Irreducible Representations
In this section, we show that every primitive ideal of C.E/ naturally determines a
corresponding maximal tail, and then construct a family of irreducible representa-
tions of C.E/ associated to each maximal tail of E.
The following lemma constructs a maximal tail from each primitive ideal of
C.E/. It was proved for arbitrary graphs in [1, Lemma 4.1] using the relationship
between ideals and saturated hereditary sets established there and that primitive
ideals of separable C-algebras are prime. Here we present instead the direct
representation-theoretic argument of [3, Theorem 5.3]. Recall that a saturated
hereditary subset of E0 is a subset whose complement satisﬁes axioms (T1) and (T2)
of a maximal tail.
Lemma 3.1 ([1, Lemma 4.1]) Let E be a row-ﬁnite graph with no sources. If I is a
primitive ideal of C.E/, then T WD fv 2 E0 W pv 62 Ig is a maximal tail of E.
Proof The set of v 2 E0 such that pv 2 I is a saturated hereditary set by [12,
Lemma 4.5] (see also [2, Lemma 4.2]). So its complement T satisﬁes (T1) and (T2).
To establish (T3), ﬁx v; w 2 T. Take an irreducible representation  W C.E/ !
B.H / such that ker./ D I. Since v 2 T, we have pv 62 I, and so . pv/H 6D f0g.
Fix  2 . pv/H with kk D 1. Since pw 62 I, the space . pw/H is also a
nontrivial subspace of H . Since  is irreducible,  is cyclic for , and so there
exists a 2 C.E/ such that . pw/.a/ D . pwapv/ is nonzero. In particular,
we have . pwapv/ 6D 0. Since C.E/ D spanfss
 W s./ D s./g, and since
pwss

Next we show how to recover a family of primitive ideals from the shift-tail
equivalence class of an inﬁnite path.
Lemma 3.2 Let E be a row-ﬁnite directed graph with no sources. For x 2 E1 and
z 2 T, there is an irreducible representation x;z W C.E/ ! B.`2.Œx// such that
for all y 2 Œx, v 2 E0 and e 2 E1, we have
x;z. pv/ıyD
(
ıy
if r.y1/Dv
0
otherwise
and
x;z.se/ıy D
(
zıey
if r.y1/ D s.e/
0
otherwise.
We have fv 2 E0 W pv 62 ker.x;z/g D Œx0.
Proof It is easy to check that `2.Œx/ is an invariant subspace of `2.E1/ for
the inﬁnite-path space representation of [12, Example 10.2] (with k D 1). So

114
T.M. Carlsen and A. Sims
the inﬁnite-path space representation reduces to a representation on B.`2.Œx//.
Precomposing with the gauge automorphism z W se 7! zse of [12, Proposition 2.1]
yields a representation x;z satisfying the desired formula.
To see that x;z is irreducible, ﬁrst observe that for each x, the rank-1 projection
x;x onto Cıx is equal to the strong limit
x;x D lim
n!1 x;z.sx1xns
x1xn/:
If y; z 2 Œx, then y D w and z D w for some ;  2 E and w 2 Œx. Thus the
rank-1 operator y;z from Cız to Cıy is in the strong closure of the image of x;z:
y;z D zjjjjx;z.s/w;wx;z.s
 / D lim
n!1 x;z.zjjjjsw1wns
w1wn/:
So K .`2.Œx// is contained in the strong closure of x;z.C.E//. Thus x;z is
irreducible.
If v 62 Œx0, then v 6D r.y1/ for any y 2 Œx, and so the formula for x;z shows
that pv 2 ker.x;z/. On the other hand, if v 2 Œx0, then we can ﬁnd y 2 Œx with
r.y1/ D v, and then x;z. pv/ıy D ıy 6D 0.

Next we want to know when two of the irreducible representations constructed
as in Lemma 3.2 have the same kernel. For the following, recall that if H 
 E0 is a
hereditary set (i.e., E0 nH satisﬁes axiom (T1) of a maximal tail.), then EnEH is the
subgraph of E with vertices E0 n H and edges E1 n E1H. Note that if T is a maximal
tail, then H WD E0 n T is a saturated hereditary set, and then E n EH D ET.
Proposition 3.3 Let E be a row-ﬁnite graph with no sources. Fix x; y 2 E1 and
w; z 2 T. The irreducible representations x;w and y;z have the same kernel if and
only if Œx0 D Œy0 and wPer.Œx0/ D zPer.Œx0/.
The crux of the proof of Proposition 3.3 is Lemma 3.5, which we state separately
because it is needed again later to prove that every primitive ideal is of the form I;z.
Our proof of Lemma 3.5 in turn relies on the following standard fact about kernels
of irreducible representations; we thank the anonymous referee for suggesting the
following elementary proof.
Lemma 3.4 Let A be a C-algebra, let J be an ideal of A, and let 1 and 2 be
irreducible representations of A that do not vanish on J. Then ker.1/ D ker.2/ if
and only if ker.1/ \ J D ker.2/ \ J.
Proof The “ H) ” direction is obvious. Suppose that ker.1/ \ J D ker.2/ \ J.
By symmetry, it sufﬁces to show that ker.1/ 
 ker.2/. Since 2 is irreducible,
ker.2/ is primitive, and hence prime (see, for example, [11, Proposition 3.13.10]).
By assumption, we have ker.1/ \ J D ker.2/ \ J 
 ker.2/. Since 2 does
not vanish on J, we have J 6
 ker.2/. So primeness of ker.2/ forces ker.1/ 
ker.2/.

The Primitive-Ideal Space of a Graph Algebra
115
Lemma 3.5 Let E be a row-ﬁnite graph with no sources, and suppose that T is a
maximal tail of E. Let H WD E0 n T.
(1) Suppose that T is an aperiodic tail and  is an irreducible representation of
C.E/ such that fv 2 E0 W . pv/ 6D 0g D T. Then ker  is generated as an
ideal by f pv W v 2 Hg.
(2) Suppose that T is a cyclic tail and that  is a cycle with no entrance in T.
Suppose that 1 and 2 are irreducible representations of C.E/ such that
fv W 1. pv/ 6D 0g D T D fv W 2. pv/ 6D 0g:
Then each i restricts to a one-dimensional representation of C.s/, and
ker 1 D ker 2 if and only if 1.s/ D 2.s/ as complex numbers. Each
ker i is generated as an ideal by f pv W v 2 Hg [ fi.s/pr./  sg.
Proof We start with some setup that is needed for both statements. Let I be the
ideal of C.E/ generated by f pv W v 2 Hg. This H is a saturated hereditary set. If
 is an irreducible representation such that fv 2 E0 W . pv/ 6D 0g D T, then I
is contained in ker  by deﬁnition. By [12, Remark 4.12], there is an isomorphism
C.E/=I Š C.EnEH/ that carries pv CI to pv for v 2 E0 nH. Since I 
 ker , the
representation  descends to an irreducible representation of C.E/=I, and hence
determines an irreducible representation Q of C.E n EH/ such that
Q. pv/ D . pv/
for v 2 E0 n H.
Now, for (1), if T is an aperiodic maximal tail, and  is as above, then every cycle
in E n H has an entrance in E n H, and Q is a representation of C.E n EH/ such that
Q. pv/ 6D 0 for all v 2 .E n EH/0. So the Cuntz–Krieger uniqueness theorem [12,
Theorem 2.4] implies that Q is faithful. Hence ker  D I, proving (1).
For (2), consider the ideal J of C.E n EH/ generated by pr./. Then Qi.J/ 6D
f0g for i D 1; 2. So Lemma 3.4 implies that Q1 and Q2 have the same kernel if
and only if ker. Q1/ \ J D ker. Q2/ \ J. Since J is generated as an ideal by pr./,
the corner pr./Jpr./ D spanfsns
m W m; n 2 Ng is full in J. Rieffel induction
from a C-algebra to a full corner is implemented by restriction of representations
[13, Proposition 3.24]. Since Rieffel induction carries irreducible representations to
irreducible representations and induces a bijection between primitive-ideal spaces,
we deduce that each Qi is an irreducible representation of C.s/ 
 J, and that
ker Q1 D ker Q2
”
ker. Q1/ \ pr./Jpr./ D ker. Q2/ \ pr./Jpr./:
Since  has no entrance, s is a unitary element of pr./Jpr./, so C.s/ Š
C..s//. Since the irreducible representations of a commutative C-algebra are
one-dimensional, we deduce that each Qi is a one-dimensional representation of
C.s/ 
 C.E n EH/ and hence each i is a one-dimensional representation of
C.s/ 
 C.E/. Moreover, Q1 and Q2 have the same kernel if and only if they are

116
T.M. Carlsen and A. Sims
implemented by evaluation at the same point z in .s/, and hence if and only if
1.s/ D 2.s/.
For the ﬁnal statement ﬁx i 2 f1; 2g. Since I is contained in the ideal J0 generated
by f pv W v 2 Hg [ fi.s/pr./  sg, we have J0 D ker i if and only if ker Qi
is equal to the image J00 of J0=I in C.E n EH/. Since Rieffel induction induces a
bijection on ideal-spaces, ker Qi D J00 if and only if pr./ ker Qipr./ D pr./J00pr./.
Both of these ideals coincide with the maximal ideal corresponding to the complex
number i.s/ 2 .s/, so we are done.

Proof of Proposition 3.3 Lemma 3.2 implies that if ker x;w D ker y;z, then Œx0 D
Œy0. So it sufﬁces to prove that if Œx0 D Œy0, then
ker x;w D ker y;z if and only if wPer.Œx0/ D zPer.Œx0/:
(3.1)
For this we consider two cases. First suppose that Œx0 is an aperiodic maximal
tail. Then Lemma 3.5(1) implies that each of ker x;w and ker y;z is generated by
f pv W v 62 Tg, and in particular the two are equal. Also, wPer.Œx0/ D w0 D 1 D z0 D
zPer.Œx0/, so the equivalence (3.1) holds.
Now suppose that Œx0 is cyclic, and let  be a cycle with no entrance in Œx0. We
must show that ker Qx;w D ker Qy;z if and only if wjj D zjj. Since  has no entrance,
both x;w. pr.//`2.Œx/ and y;z. pr.//`2.Œy/ are equal to the one-dimensional space
Cı1, and we have
x;w.s/ı1 D wjjı1
and
y;z.s/ı1 D zjjı1:
So, identifying the image of x;w.C.s// with C, we have x;w.s/ D wjj and
similarly y;z.s/ D zjj. So Lemma 3.5(2) shows that ker x;w D ker y;z if and
only if zjj D wjj.

We are now ready for our ﬁrst main result—a catalogue of the primitive ideals of
C.E/. Proposition 3.3 says that the following deﬁnition makes sense.
Deﬁnition 3.6 Let E be a row-ﬁnite directed graph with no sources. Suppose that
T is a maximal tail in E0 and that z 2 fwPer.T/ W w 2 Tg 
 T. We deﬁne
IT;z WD ker x;w for any .x; w/ 2 E1  T such that Œx0 D T and wPer.T/ D z.
Theorem 3.7 The map .T; z/ 7! IT;z is a bijection from
f.T; wPer.T// W T is a maximal tail, w 2 Tg
to Prim C.E/.

The Primitive-Ideal Space of a Graph Algebra
117
Proof Lemma 3.2 shows that each IT;z is a primitive ideal. Proposition 3.3 shows
that .T; z/ 7! IT;z is injective. So we just have to show that it is surjective. Fix
a primitive ideal J of C.E/, let T D fv W pv 62 Jg, and let  be an irreducible
representation of C.E/ with kernel J. Then T is a maximal tail according to
Lemma 3.1. We must show that J has the form IT;z.
If T is aperiodic, then Lemma 3.5(1) shows that J D ker  D ker x;1 D IŒx0;1
for any x such that Œx0 D T.
If T is cyclic, let  be a cycle with no entrance in T. Lemma 3.5(2) shows that
.C.s// is one-dimensional, so we can identify .s/ with a nonzero complex
number z. Since s is an isometry, jzj D 1. Now Lemma 3.5(2) implies that any
w 2 T with wjj D z satisﬁes ker  D ker Œ10;w D IŒx0;z.

The Closure Operation
The Jacobson, or hull-kernel, topology on Prim C.E/ is the one determined by the
closure operation X D fI 2 Prim C.E/ W T
J2X J 
 Ig. The ideals of C.E/ are
in bijection with the closed subsets of Prim C.E/: the ideal IX corresponding to a
closed subset X is
IX WD T
J2X J:
So the ﬁrst step in describing the ideals of C.E/ is to say when a primitive ideal
I belongs to the closure of a set X of primitive ideals. We do so with the following
theorem.
Theorem 4.1 Let E be a row-ﬁnite graph with no sources. Let X be a set of pairs
.T; z/ consisting of a maximal tail T and an element z of fwPer.T/ W w 2 Tg. Consider
another such pair .S; w/. Then T
.T;z/2X IT;z 
 IS;w if and only if both of the following
hold:
a) S 
 S
.T;z/2X T, and
b) if S is a cyclic tail and the cycle  with no entrance in S also has no entrance in
S
.T;z/2X T, then
w 2 fz W .S; z/ 2 Xg:
We will need the following simple lemma in the proof Theorem 4.1, and at a
number of other points later in the paper.
Lemma 4.2 Let E be a row-ﬁnite graph with no sources, let H be a saturated
hereditary subset of C.E/ and let  be a cycle with no entrance in E0 n H. Let
IH be the ideal of C.E/ generated by f pv W v 2 Hg. Then there is an isomorphism
. pr./C.E/pr.//=. pr./IHpr.// Š pr./C.E n EH/pr./

118
T.M. Carlsen and A. Sims
carrying sCpr./IHpr./ to s, and there is an isomorphism of pr./C.EnEH/pr./
onto C.T/ carrying s to the generating monomial function z 7! z.
Proof Remark 4.12 of [12] shows that there is an isomorphism C.E/=IH Š C.En
EH/ that carries se C IH to se if e 2 E1 n E1H and to zero otherwise. This restricts to
the desired isomorphism pr./C.E/pr./=pr./IHpr./ Š pr./C.E n EH/pr./. The
element s 2 pr./C.E n EH/pr./ satisﬁes s
s D pr./ D ss
 because  has
no entrance in E0 n H. So it sufﬁces to show that the spectrum of s calculated in
pr./C.E n EH/pr./ is T. To see this, observe that the gauge action  satisﬁes
w.s/ D wjj.s/. So for ; w 2 T, pr./  s is invertible if and only if
w.pr./  s/ D wjj.wjjpr./  s/ is invertible. That is, ./ is invariant
under rotation by elements of the form wjj, which comprise all of T. Since the
spectrum is nonempty, it follows that it is the whole circle.

Proof of Theorem 4.1 We ﬁrst prove the “if” direction. So suppose that (a) and (b)
are satisﬁed. We consider two cases. First suppose that S is an aperiodic tail. Then
Per.S/ D f0g, and so w D 1. For each maximal tail T of E, let
T WD T n fv W v lies on a cycle with no entrance in Tg;
and let IT be the ideal generated by f pv W v 62 Tg. If T is a cyclic maximal tail and
 is a cycle with no entrance in T, and if z 2 fwPer.T/ W w 2 Tg, then Lemma 3.5(2)
shows that IT;z is generated by f pv W v 62 Tg [ fzpr./  sg. So IT;z 
 IT. So it
sufﬁces to show that
T
.T;z/2X IT 
 IS;1:
For this it sufﬁces to show that S
.T;z/2X T  S. We ﬁx v 2 E0 n S
.T;z/2X T and
show that v 62 S. If v 62 T for all .T; z/ 2 X, then it follows from (a) that v 62 S.
So we may assume that v 2
 S
.T;z/2X T

n
 S
.T;Z/2X T

. In particular, there exist
pairs .T; z/ 2 X such that v 2 T. Fix any such pair. Since v 62 T, it must lie in a
cycle  in T with no entrance in T. Property (T1) shows that  is contained entirely
in T, and then Lemma 2.2 then gives T D Œ10 D r.Ev/. So  has no entrance in
r.Ev/, and the only pairs .T; z/ 2 X with v 2 T satisfy T D r.Ev/. Thus  has no
entrance in S
.T;z/2X T. Since S 
 S
.T;z/2X T, and every cycle in S has an entrance
in S, we deduce that  does not lie in S and hence v 62 S as required.
Now suppose that S is cyclic and  is a cycle with no entrance in S. Let V be the
set of vertices on . Lemma 2.2 gives S D fr.˛/ W s.˛/ 2 Vg. Since S 
 S
.T;z/2X T,
there exists .T; z/ 2 X with r./ 2 T. Since T satisﬁes (T1), we deduce that the
cycle  lies in the subgraph ET of E. So there exists .T; z/ 2 X such that V 
 T,
and then S 
 T because S D fr.˛/ W s.˛/ 2 Vg and T satisﬁes (T1). So it sufﬁces to
show that
T
.T;z/2X;ST IT;z 
 IS;!:

The Primitive-Ideal Space of a Graph Algebra
119
For this, ﬁrst suppose that there exists .T; z/ 2 X such that T is a proper superset of
S; say v 2 T n S. Since S D fr.˛/ W s.˛/ 2 Vg, we see that vEV D ;, and hence
vES D ;. So there exists w 2 T n S such that VEw and vEw are both nonempty.
Hence
T  fr.˛/ W s.˛/ D wg  fr.˛/ W s.˛/ 2 Vg D S:
If T is a cyclic tail, the cycle with no entrance that it contains lies outside of S, so the
ﬁnal statement of Lemma 3.5(2) shows that all the generators of IT;z belong to IS;w;
and if T is aperiodic, then all the generators of IT;z belong to IS;w by Lemma 3.5(1).
In either case, we conclude that IT;z 
 IS;w, and hence T
.T;z/2X;ST IT;z 
 IS;!.
So it now sufﬁces to show that T
zW.S;z/2X IS;z 
 IS;w. Let IS be the ideal generated
by f pv W v 62 Sg. Then each IS;z contains IS, as does IS;w, so we need only show
that in the quotient C.E/=IS Š C.ES/, the intersection of the images Jz of the IS;z
is contained in Jw. Each Jz is generated by zpr./  s and is therefore contained
in the ideal generated by pr./, and similarly for Jw. Since the ideal generated by
pr./ is Morita equivalent to the corner determined by pr./, it sufﬁces to show
that T
.S;z/2X pr./Jzpr./ 
 pr./Jwpr./. The isomorphism pr./C.ES/pr./ Š
C.T/ of Lemma 4.2 carries each pr./Jzpr./ to ff 2 C.T/ W f.z/ D 0g. So
T
.S;z/2X pr./Jzpr./ is carried to
˚f 2 C.T/ W f  0 on fz W .S; z/ 2 Xg;
and in particular is contained in the image of pr./Jwpr./.
We now prove the “only if” direction. To do this, we prove the contrapositive.
So we ﬁrst suppose that (a) does not hold. Then there is some v 2 S n S
.T;z/ T.
This implies that pv 2 I.T;z/ for all .T; z/, but pv 62 IS;w, and so T
.T;z/ IT;z 6
 IS;w as
required.
Now suppose that S 
 S
.T;z/ T, that  is a cycle with no entrance in S and
that  also has no entrance in S
.T;z/2X T, and that w 62 fz W .S; z/ 2 Xg. As above,
S D fr.˛/ W s.˛/ D r./g, and since  has no entrance in any T, for each .T; z/
we have either T D S or r./ 62 T. Whenever r./ 62 T, we have pr./ 2 I.T;z/, and
so T
.T;z/ pr./IT;zpr./ D T
.S;z/2X pr./IS;zpr./. Once again taking quotients by IS, it
sufﬁces to show that
\
.S;z/2X
pr./Jzpr./ 6
 pr./Jwpr./:
Since w 62 fz W .S; z/ 2 Xg, there exists f 2 C.T/ such that f.w/ D 0 and f.z/ D 1
whenever .S; z/ 2 X. Let g D 1  f 2 C.T/. Then the images of the elements f
and g belong to T
.S;z/2X pr./Jzpr./ and pr./Jwpr./ respectively. Their sum is the

pr./Jwpr./ C

Consequently, T

The Ideals of C.E/
We use Theorem 4.1 above to describe all the ideals of C.E/. We index them by
what we call ideal pairs for E. To deﬁne these, given a saturated hereditary set H of
E0, we will write C .H/ for the set
C .H/ WD f W  is a cycle with no entrance in E0 n Hg:
An ideal pair for E is then a pair .H; U/ where H is a saturated hereditary set, and
U is a function assigning to each  2 C .H/ a proper open subset U./ of T, with
the property that U./ D U./ whenever Œ1 D Œ1.
Observe that if the maximal tail E0nH is aperiodic, so that C .H/ D ;, then there
is exactly one ideal pair of the form .H; U/: the function U is the unique (trivial)
function from the empty set to the collection of proper open subsets of T.
To see how to obtain an ideal of C.E/ from an ideal pair, we need to do a little
bit of background work.
For each open subset U 
 T, we ﬁx a function hU 2 C.T/ such that
fz 2 T W hU.z/ 6D 0g D U:
For example, we could take
hU.z/ WD inffjz  wj W w … Ug:
Let  W C.T/ ! `2.Z/ be the faithful representation that carries the generating
monomial z 7! z to the bilateral shift operator U W en 7! enC1. The classical theory
of Toeplitz operators says that if PC W `2.Z/ ! `2.N/ denotes the orthogonal
projection onto the Hardy space spanfen W n  0g, then there is an isomorphism 
from PC.C.T//PC to the Toeplitz algebra T 
 `2.N/ generated by the unilateral
shift operator S, such that if q W T ! C.T/ is the quotient map that divides out the
ideal of compact operators, then q..PC. f/PC// D f for every f 2 C.T/.
If H 
 E0 is saturated and hereditary, then for each  2 C .H/, we have ss
 
pr./ D s
s, with equality precisely if  has no entrance in E0. So if  has no
entrance in E0, then s is unitary in pr./C.E/pr./, and we can apply the functional
calculus in the corner to deﬁne a nonzero element hU.s/ 2 C.E/. If  has an

The Primitive-Ideal Space of a Graph Algebra
121
entrance in E0, then ss
 < s
s, so Coburn’s theorem [4] gives an isomorphism
 W T Š C.s/ that carries S to s.
Using the preceding paragraph, given an ideal pair .H; U/ and given  2 C .H/,
we obtain an element U
 2 C.s/ 
 pr./C.E/pr./ given by

otherwise.
Theorem 5.1 Let E be a row-ﬁnite graph with no sources. Let IE denote the set
of all ideal pairs for E. For each .H; U/ 2 IE, let JH;U be the ideal of C.E/
generated by
f pv W v 2 Hg [ fU
 W  2 C .H/g:
(1) The map .H; U/ 7! JH;U is a bijection of IE onto the collection of all closed
2-sided ideals of C.E/.
(2) Given an ideal I of C.E/, let HI WD fv 2 E0 W pv 2 Ig, and for  2 C .HI/, let
UI./ D T n spec. pr./CI/.C.E/=I/. pr./CI/.s C I/. Then .HI; UI/ is an ideal pair
and I D JHI;UI.
Before proving the theorem, we need the following lemma.
Lemma 5.2 Let E be a row-ﬁnite directed graph with no sources. Let .H; U/ be an
ideal pair for E, let T be a maximal tail of E and take z 2 fwPer.T/ W w 2 Tg. Then
JH;U 
 IT;z if and only if both of the following hold:
a) H 
 E0 n T; and
b) if T is cyclic and the cycle  with no entrance in T belongs to C .H/, then z 62
U./.
In particular, we have fv W pv 2 JH;Ug D H.
Proof For the “if” direction, ﬁx x 2 E1 such that T D Œx0 and w 2 T such
that wPer.T/ D z. We just have to show that x;w annihilates all the generators of
JH;U. For this, ﬁrst ﬁx v 2 H. Then the ﬁnal statement of Lemma 3.2 shows that
pv 2 ker x;w. Now ﬁx  2 C .H/. If r./ 62 T, then x;w. pr.// D 0 as above
and then since U
 2 pr./C.E/pr./, it follows that x;w.U
 / D 0. So suppose
that r./ 2 T. Since  has no entrance in E0 n H and since T 
 E0 n H, the
cycle  has no entrance in T. So T is a cyclic maximal tail, and Œx0 D Œ10
by Lemma 2.2. We then have z 62 U./ by hypothesis. The ideal IH generated by
f pv W v 2 Hg is contained in ker.x;w/, so x;w descends to a representation Qx;w
of C.E/=IH. Lemma 4.2 shows that pr./C.E/pr./=pr./Ipr./ Š C.T/, and this
isomorphism carries the restriction of Qx;w to the one-dimensional representation z
given by evaluation at z. The isomorphism of Lemma 4.2 also carries U
 Cpr./Ipr./
to hU./. Since z 62 U./, we have z.hU.// D 0, and so x;w.U
 / D 0. So all of the
generators of JH;U belong to ker x;w as required.

For the “only if” implication, we prove the contrapositive. Again ﬁx x 2 E1
such that T D Œx0 and w 2 T such that wPer.T/ D z, so that IT;z D ker x;w. First
suppose that H 6
 E0 n T; say v 2 T \ H. Then pv 2 JH;U by deﬁnition, but
pv 62 ker x;w by the ﬁnal statement of Lemma 3.2, giving JH;U 6
 ker x;w. Now
suppose that H 
 E0 n T, that T is cyclic and that the cycle  with no entrance in T
belongs to C .H/, but that z 2 U./. Arguing as in the preceding paragraph, we see
that x;w.hU./.z/pr./  U
 / D 0. Since U
 2 JH;U, we deduce that pr./ 2 JH;U C
ker x;w. Since pr./ 62 ker x;w by Lemma 3.2, we deduce that JH;U 6
 ker x;w.
For the ﬁnal statement, observe that H 
 fv W pv 2 JH;Ug by deﬁnition. For the
reverse containment, recall that by deﬁnition of an ideal pair, each U./ is a proper
subset of T. So for each  2 C .H/, we can choose z 2 TnU./. By the preceding
paragraphs, we have JH;U 
 IŒ0;z for each  2 C .H/. For each v 2 E0 n H that
does not belong to Œ10 for any  2 C .H/, we can choose an inﬁnite path xv in
E0 n H with r.xv
1/ D v. This xv 62 Œ1 for  2 C .H/ because v does not belong
to any Œ10. So each Œxv0 is a maximal tail contained in the complement of H and
the preceding paragraphs show that JH;U 
 IŒxv0;1. We now have
JH;U 
	 T
 IŒ0;z

\
	 T
v IŒxv0;1

:
By construction, the right-hand side does not contain pv for any v 62 H, and so we
deduce that v 62 H implies pv 62 JH;U as required.

Proof of Theorem 5.1 To prove the theorem, it sufﬁces to show that the assignment
.H; U/ 7! JH;U is injective, and then prove statement (2).
The general theory of C-algebras says that every ideal of a C-algebra A is
equal to the intersection of all of the primitive ideals that contain it. By deﬁnition,
the topology on Prim.A/ is the weakest one in which fI 2 Prim.A/ W J 
 Ig is closed
for every ideal J of A, and the map which sends J to this closed subset of Prim.A/
is a bijection. So to prove that .H; U/ 7! JH;U is injective, we just have to show that
the closed sets YH;U WD fI 2 Prim C.E/ W JH;U 
 Ig are distinct for distinct pairs
.H; U/.
By Lemma 5.2, we have
YH;U D fIT;z W T 
 E0 n H is a maximal tail, and
if T is cyclic and the cycle  with no entrance in T
also has no entrance in H, then z 62 U./g:
Suppose that .H1; U1/ and .H2; U2/ are distinct ideal pairs of E. We consider
two cases. First suppose that H1 6D H2. Without loss of generality, there exists
v 2 H1 n H2. Since H2 is saturated, there exists e1 2 vE1 such that s.e1/ 62 H2.
Since H1 is hereditary, we have s.e/ 2 H1. Repeating this argument we obtain
edges ei 2 s.ei1/E1 with s.ei/ 2 H1 n H2, and hence an inﬁnite path x lying in
.E n EH1/ n .E n EH2/. Now Œx0 is a maximal tail contained in H1 n H2. If Œx0 is

The Primitive-Ideal Space of a Graph Algebra
123
an aperiodic tail or is a cyclic tail such that the cycle with no entrance in Œx0 has an
entrance in E n EH2, we set z D 1. If Œx0 D Œ10 for some  2 C .H2/, we choose
any z 2 T n U2./. Then Lemma 5.2 shows that IŒx0;z 2 YH2;U2 n YH1;U1.
Now suppose that H1 D H2. Then U1 6D U2, so we can ﬁnd  2 C .H1/ D C .H2/
such that U1./ 6D U2./. Again without loss of generality, we can assume that
there exists z 2 U1./ n U2./, and then we have IŒ10;z 2 YH2;U2 n YH1;U1. This
completes the proof that the YH;U are distinct.
It remains to prove (2). Given an ideal I, the set H WD HI is a saturated hereditary
set by [12, Lemma 4.5]. Since the ideal IH generated by f pv W v 2 Hg is contained in
I, Lemma 4.2 shows that s C I is unitary in . pr./ C I/C.E/=I. pr./ C I/ for each
 2 C.H/; so its spectrum is a closed subset of T, showing that UI./ is an open
subset of T. If ;  2 C.H/ with Œ1 D Œ1, then 1 D ˛1 for some initial
segment ˛ of 1. The Cuntz–Krieger relations show that s
˛ss˛ C I D s C I and
s˛ss
˛ C I D s C I; so conjugation by s˛ C I gives an isomorphism C.s/ C I Š
C.s/ C I, and in particular
spec. pr./CI/.C.E/=I/. pr./CI/.s C I/ D spec. pr./CI/.C.E/=I/.pr./CI/.s C I/;
giving UI./ D UI./. So .H; U/ is an ideal pair.
To see that I D JHI;UI, we ﬁrst check the containment . For this, it sufﬁces to
show that every generator of JHI;UI belongs to I. We have pv 2 I for all v 2 HI by
deﬁnition. Fix  2 C .HI/; we must show that UI
 2 I. For this, let IH be the ideal of
C.E/ generated by f pv W v 2 Hg. Since IH is contained in both I and JHI;UI we just
have to show that JHI;UI=IH is contained in I=IH. For this, let  W pr./C.E/pr./ !
C.T/ be the composition of the isomorphism of Lemma 4.2 with the canonical
surjection pr./C.E/pr./ ! . pr./ C IH/.C.E/=IH/. pr./ C IH/. Then .UI
 / D
hUI./ vanishes on T n UI./, which is spec. pr./CI/.C.E/=I/. pr./CI/.s C I/. Since
the quotient map by the image of I under  is given by restriction of functions to
spec. pr./CI/.C.E/=I/.pr./CI/.s C I/, it follows that UI
 C IH 2 I=IH as required.
For the reverse containment, recall that every ideal of C.E/ is the intersection
of the primitive ideals that contain it, so it sufﬁces to show that if IS;w 2 YHI;UI, then
I 
 IS;w. Fix IS;w 2 YHI;UI. We can express I as an intersection of primitive ideals
and therefore, by Theorem 3.7, we have I D T
.T;z/2X IT;z for some set X of pairs
consisting of a maximal tail T and an element z 2 fuPer.T/ W u 2 Tg. We then have
v 2 HI ” pv 2 I ” pv 2 T
.T;z/2X IT;z ” v 2 T
.T;z/2X E0 n T;
and we deduce that HI D E0nS
.T;z/2X T. Since IS;w 2 YHI;UI, we have S 
 E0nHI D
S
.T;z/2X T. So if S is an aperiodic tail, or is a cyclic tail such that the cycle  with
no entrance in S has an entrance in S
.T;z/2X T, then Theorem 4.1 immediately gives
I D T
.T;z/2X IT;z 
 IS;w. So suppose that S is cyclic, and the cycle  with no
entrance in S has no entrance in S
.T;z/2X T. Again using that IS;w 2 YHI;UI, we
see that w 62 UI./. Hence w 2 spec. pr./CI/.C.E/=I/.pr./CI/.s C I/. So if  W
pr./C.E/pr./ ! C.T/ is the map described in the preceding paragraph, we have
f.w/ D 0 for all f in .I/ D T
.S;z/2X .IS;z/. Each .IS;z/ is the set of functions

124

that vanishes at z, so we deduce that every function vanishing at every z for which
.S; z/ 2 X also vanishes at w; that is w 2 fz W .S; z/ 2 Xg. Now Theorem 4.1 again
gives I D T
.T;z/2X IT;z 
 IS;w.

Remark 5.3 To see where the primitive ideals of C.E/ ﬁt into the catalogue of
Theorem 5.1, ﬁrst let us establish the convention that if C .H/ D ;, then ; denotes
the unique (trivial) function from C .H/ to the collection of open subsets of T, and
that if C .H/ is a singleton, then Lz denotes the function on C .H/ that assigns the
value T n fzg to the unique element of C .H/. Now if T is a maximal tail and z 2
fwPer.T/ W w 2 Tg, then Lemma 3.5 and the deﬁnition of the ideals JH;U show that
IT;z D
(
JE0nT;;
if T is aperiodic
JE0nT;Lz
if T is cyclic.
Remark 5.4 The ideal JH;U is gauge invariant (i.e., z.JH;U/ D JH;U for every z 2 T)
if and only if U./ D ; for every  2 C .H/, in which case JH;U D IH. Thus, we
recover from Theorem 5.1 the description of the gauge invariant ideals of C.E/
presented in [1, Theorem 4.1].

The Lattice Structure
To ﬁnish off the description of the lattice of ideals of C.E/, we describe the
complete-lattice structure in terms of ideal pairs.
We deﬁne  on the set IE of ideal pairs for a row-ﬁnite graph E with no
sources by
.H1; U1/  .H2; U2/
”
H1 
 H2 and U1./ 
 U2./
for all  2 C .H1/ \ C .H2/:
In the following, given X 
 T, we write Int.X/ for the interior of X.
Theorem 6.1 Let E be a row-ﬁnite graph with no sources.
(1) Given ideal pairs .H1; U1/ and .H2; U2/ for E, we have JH1;U1 
 JH2;U2 if and
only if .H1; U1/  .H2; U2/.
(2) Given a set K 
 IE of ideal pairs for E, we have T
.H;U/2K JH;U D JHK;UK
where HK D T
.H;U/2K H, and UK./ D Int

(3) Fix a set K 
 IE of ideal pairs of E. Let A be the saturated hereditary closure of
S
.H;U/2K H. Let B D fr./ W  2 C .A/ and S
.H;U/2K;2C .H/ U./ D Tg. Let
HK be the saturated hereditary closure of A[B in E0, and for each  2 C .HK/,
let UK./ D S

The Primitive-Ideal Space of a Graph Algebra
125
Proof (1): First suppose that .H1; U1/  .H2; U2/. We show that every generator
of JH1;U1 belongs to JH2;U2. For each v 2 H1 we have v 2 H2 and therefore
pv 2 JH2;U2. Suppose that  2 C .H1/. If r./ 2 H2, then pr./ 2 JH2;U2 and
so U1

2 pr./C.E/pr./ belongs to JH2;U2 as well. So we may suppose that
r./ 62 H2. Since H1 
 H2 and since  has no entrance in E0 n H1, it cannot
have an entrance in E0 n H2, so it belongs to C .H2/. The ideal IH1 generated
by f pv W v 2 H1g is contained in both JH1;U1 and JH2;U2. By Lemma 4.2, we
have . pr./ C IH1/.C.E/=IH1/. pr./ C IH1/ Š C.T/ and this isomorphism carries
U1

to hU1./ and carries the image of JH2;U2 to ff 2 C.T/ W f 1.C n f0g/ 
U2./g. Since U1./ 
 U2./, it follows that the image of U1

in the corner
. pr./ C IH1/.C.E/=IH1/. pr./ C IH1/ belongs to the image of JH2;U2, and therefore
U1
 C IH1 
 JH2;U2, giving U1
 2 JH2;U2.
Now suppose that JH1;U1 
 JH2;U2. The ﬁnal statement of Lemma 5.2 shows
that H1 
 H2, so we must show that whenever  2 C .H1/ \ C .H2/, we have
U1./ 
 U2./. Theorem 5.1 (2) shows that
Ui./ D T n spec. pr./CJHi;Ui/.C.E/=JHi;Ui/. pr./CJHi;Ui/.s C JHi;Ui/:
Since JH1;U1 
 JH2;U2, there is a homomorphism q W C.E/=JH1;U1 ! C.E/=JH2;U2
that carries s CJH1;U1 to s CJH2;U2. In particular, q carries pr./ CJH1;U1 to pr./ C
JH2;U2, and so induces a unital homomorphism between the corners determined by
these projections. Since unital homomorphisms decrease spectra, we obtain
spec. pr./CJH2;U2/.C.E/=JH2;U2/. pr./CJH2;U2/.s C JH2;U2/

 spec. pr./CJH1;U1/.C.E/=JH1;U1/. pr./CJH1;U1/.s C JH1;U1/;
and hence U1./ 
 U2./.
(2): The ideal T
.H;U/2K JH;U is the largest ideal that is contained in JH;U for every
.H; U/ in K. Since the map .H; U/ ! JH;U is a bijection carrying  to 
, it sufﬁces
to show that .HK; UK/  .H; U/ for all .H; U/ 2 K, and is maximal with respect
to  amongst pairs .H00; U00/ satisfying .H00; U00/  .H; U/ for all .H; U/ 2 K. The
pair .HK; UK/ satisﬁes .HK; UK/  .H; U/ for all .H; U/ 2 K by deﬁnition of HK
and UK. Suppose that .H00; U00/  .H; U/. Then H00 
 H for all .H; U/ 2 K, and
hence H00 
 HK; and if  2 C .H00/\C .HK/, and if .H; U/ 2 K satisﬁes  2 C .H/,
then U00./ 
 U./ because .H00; U00/  .H; U/. So U00./ is an open subset of
T
.H;U/2K;2C .H/ U./, and therefore belongs to Int
 T
.H;U/2K;2C .H/ U./

D UK.
(3): The ideal span
 S
.H;U/2K JH;U

is the smallest ideal containing JH;U for
every .H; U/ in K. So as above it sufﬁces to show that .H; U/  .HK; UK/ for all
.H; U/ 2 K, and that .HK; UK/ is minimal with respect to  amongst pairs .H00; U00/
satisfying .H; U/  .H00; U00/ for all .H; U/ 2 K. The pair .HK; UK/ satisﬁes
.H; U/  .HK; UK/ for all .H; U/ 2 K by construction. Suppose that .H00; U00/
is another ideal pair satisfying .H; U/  .H00; U00/ for all .H; U/ 2 K. We just have
to show that .HK; UK/  .H00; U00/. We have H 
 H00 for every .H; U/ 2 K, and
since H00 is saturated and hereditary, it follows that A 
 H00. If v 2 B, then there

126
T.M. Carlsen and A. Sims
exists  2 C .A/ such that S
.H;U/2K;2C .H/ U./ D T, and then by compactness
of T, there are ﬁnitely many pairs .H1; U1/; : : : ; .Hn; Un/ 2 K such that  2 C .Hi/
for each i, and Sn
iD1 U./ D T. Choose a partition of unity ff1; : : : ; fng 2 C.T/
subordinate to the Ui. Let IA be the ideal of C.E/ generated by f pv W v 2 Ag.
Then each fi belongs to the image of pr./J.Hi;Ui/pr./ under the isomorphism of
Lemma 4.2, and so 1 D P
i fi belongs to the image of Pn
iD1 pr./JHi;Uipr./. Since
each .Hi; Ui/  .H00; K00/, it follows that 1 belongs to the image of J.H00;K00/. But the
preimage of 1 is pr./CIA, and we deduce that pr./ 2 J.H00;K00/. The ﬁnal statement of
Lemma 5.2 therefore implies that v 2 H00. So A[B 
 H00, and since H00 is saturated
and hereditary, it follows that HK 
 H00. Now suppose that  2 C .HK/ \ C .H00/.
For each z 2 UK./, there exists .H; U/ 2 K such that  2 C .H/ and z 2 U./.
Since .H; U/  .H00; U00/ and  2 C .H00/ \ C .H/, we deduce that z 2 U00./. So
UK./ 
 U00./. So we have .HK; UK/  .H00; U00/ as required.

Commutator Inequalities via Schur Products
Erik Christensen
Abstract For a self-adjoint unbounded operator D on a Hilbert space H; a bounded
operator y on H and some Borel functions g.t/ we establish inequalities of the type
kŒg.D/; yk  A0kykCA1kŒD; ykCA2kŒD; ŒD; ykC  CAnkŒD; ŒD; : : : ŒD; y : : : k:
The proofs take place in a space of inﬁnite matrices with operator entries, and in this
setting it is possible to approximate the matrix associated to Œg.D/; y by the Schur
product of a matrix approximating ŒD; y and a scalar matrix. A classical inequality
on the norm of Schur products may then be applied to obtain the results.

Introduction
Let D be an unbounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H Then for a
bounded operator y on H the commutator ŒD; y may be of interest for several
reasons. From our personal point of view, we have previously studied mathematical
physics [10], noncommutative geometry [5] and operator algebras [7] and found
that commutators do occur for natural reasons. The most common one being that the
expression ŒD; y WD DyyD denotes the derivative of the function t ! ieitDyeitD
at t D 0. It is well known [1], that this derivative may or may not exist, and if
it exists, it may be as a limit of difference quotients taken in the norm topology
or as a limit in the ultraweak topology on B.H/; and it follows from [13] and
[9] that the ultraweak limit may exist in cases where the uniform limit does not
exist. If the ultraweak limit exists, we say that y is weakly-D differentiable and the
bounded operator which is the limit is denoted ıD.y/; and if no mistakes are possible
we will just write ı.y/. Following [1] we let C1.D/ denote the algebra of weakly
D-differentiable operators on H; and in the article [3] we gave a presentation of some
of the equivalent formulations of weak D-differentiability. Our personal contribution
in this direction is based on a study of a space of inﬁnite matrices with bounded

operators as entries, and we showed that for any bounded operator y the matrix
associated with ŒD; y is always deﬁned in this set up, but it represents a bounded
operator exactly when y is weakly D-differentiable. This set up makes it possible
to deﬁne all the algebraic operations needed to work with higher commutators,
although the higher commutators may not exist as densely deﬁned operators.
In the article [4] we continued this work by studying higher commutators such
as ŒD; ŒD; : : : ; ŒD; y : : :  and we showed—among other things—that an operator
y is k times weakly D-differentiable if and only if all the matrix commutators
ŒD; ŒD; : : : ŒD; y : : :  up to the order k represent bounded operators.
Based on a question coming from noncommutative geometry and a question
coming from the study of perturbations of operator algebras we got interested
in relations between different commutators applied to the same bounded operator y.
To be more precise, the question from non commutative geometry asks for relations
between the commutators ŒjDj; yj and ŒD; y; where we deﬁne for D its numerical
value jDj by jDj WD .D2/.1=2/. We show that for any natural number n and a bounded
operator y on H; that if y is n C 1 times weakly D-differentiable then it is n times
weakly jDjdifferentiable, and we obtain a norm estimate for the norm of the n0th
derivative of y with respect to jDj expressed in terms of norms of the n C 1 ﬁrst
derivatives of y with respect to D. These results are presented in Sect. 5.
The question raised by the perturbation of operator algebras dealt with the
question whether for a positive operator D, almost commutation with a bounded
operator y is inherited by the square root D.1=2/. It turned out that some results of
this type are known, see for instance [12], so even though the set up we use in this
article can be used to obtain some results of this type, we cannot produce inequalities
as sharp as the known ones, so our results of this sort are not included in this article.
It turns out that for some complex Borel functions g.t/ on R the relations between
the commutators Œg.D/; y and ŒD; y may, approximately, be expressed as a Schur
product, and this is the basic observation which is behind the results in this article,
as described in Sect. 3.
The Schur product between scalar matrices A D .aij/ and B D .bij/ is simply the
element-wise product .aij/  .bij/ D .aijbij/ of the two matrices. With the kind help
of Vern Paulsen we found a result by Bennett [2] on the norm of a Schur product of
two scalar matrices, which we can use in our computations, and in Sect. 2 we have
modiﬁed Bennett’s result from the setting of scalar matrices to matrices of operators
and in this way we have found solutions to the problems mentioned above and also
to some general results of the type

This applies for instance to the cases when g.t/ is bounded or g.t/ is Hölder
continuous or g.t/ is absolutely continuous with a derivative which may be written
as a sum of an integrable function and an essentially bounded function. We present
our abstract results in Sect. 5, where we also give applications to the cases where

Schur Products, Row- and Column-Bounded Matrices
This section contains a single result, which is an operator space version [6, 15] of
a result by Bennett, [2] Theorem 1.1 point (i). Given a couple of scalar matrices
A D .aij/.i;j/2IJ and B D .bij/.i;j/2IJ over the same pair of sets of indices I
and J; then the Schur product C WD A  B is deﬁned as the matrix, of the same
size, formed as the products of the entries, cij WD aijbij. Bennett thought of such
matrices over the scalars as operators between spaces `p.J/ and `q.I/. In particular
he proved that if the matrix B corresponds to a bounded operator in B.`2.J/; `1.I//
and the matrix A corresponds to a bounded operator in B.`1.J/; `2.I//; then A  B
is a bounded operator in B.`2.J/; `2.I//. The theory of Schur multipliers has been
extended to the more general setting of operator spaces and operator modules, see
for instance Paulsen’s book [11] and the books by Pisier [14] and [15]. A closer
look at the deﬁnition of the Schur product—cij D aijbij—immediately tells that the
product may be meaningful in many different situations, such as the case when all
the elements aij and bij are operators on the same Hilbert space, but also in the quite
unrelated situation where the elements aij are scalars and the bij are elements in a
family Bij of Banach spaces. We are sure that we have not found all the possible
generalizations of Bennett’s theorem to the setting of operator spaces, but we have
searched and found two versions, which are useful for this article and for our general
interests.
The language we use is based on the words column- and row-bounded matrices
of operators, which we deﬁne below.
The ﬁrst version is formed as a statement on inﬁnite matrices over the algebra
of bounded operators algebras on a Hilbert space H. This result will not be used
directly in this article, but we ﬁnd quite easily a corollary, which we will use several
times, in the sections to come.
Deﬁnition 2.1 Let J be an index set and H a Hilbert space, the set of all matrices
S D .sij/.i;j2J/ with entries sij 2 B.H/ is denoted MJ.B.H//.
(i)
A matrix S D .sij/ in MJ.B.H// is said to be bounded if it represents a bounded
operator in B.H ˝ `2.J//. If S is bounded, the term kSk means that norm.

8j 2 J 8J0 ﬁnite 
 J W k
X

s
ijsijk  K2:
The column norm kSkc is deﬁned as the least possible such K.
(iv)
Let K D .kij/ and L D .lij/ be matrices in MJ.B.H//. Then their Schur product is
the matrix K  L in MJ.B.H// deﬁned by .K  L/ij WD kijlij.
In this setting our version of Bennett’s result becomes
Theorem 2.2 Let K D .kij/ and L D .lij/ be matrices in MJ.B.H// such that K is
row bounded and L is column bounded. Then K  L is bounded in MJ.B.H// and
kK  Lk  kKkrkLkc.
Proof Let J0

Remark 2.3 Matrices may be indexed by different indices for columns and rows,
say I and J. The theorem above applies to this situation too, since such matrices
embed naturally into square matrices over the set I [ J.
The proof above applies to a situation which looks quite different. We will now
look at a Hilbert space H and a family .ej/.j2J/ of pairwise orthogonal projections
in B.H/ with strong operator sum IB.H/. Then we deﬁne M as the linear space of
all matrices A D .aij/.i;j2J/ and aij 2 eiB.H/ej. The space S is deﬁned as all the
square scalar matrices over the index set J. A matrix S D .sij/ in S is said to be
bounded if it is the matrix of a bounded operator on `2.J; C/; and similarly a matrix
A D .aij/ in M is bounded if there exists a bounded operator y on H; such that for
each pair i; j we have aij D eiyej. The deﬁnitions of row- and column boundedness
of S and A are made in the obvious way. Given a matrix S D .sij/ in S and a matrix
A D .aij/ in M ; their Schur product S  A D .sijaij/ is a matrix in M and we get a
new version of Bennett’s result
Corollary 2.4 Let S D .sij/ and A D .aij/ be matrices in S and M such that S
is row bounded and A is column bounded, then S  A is bounded and kS  Ak 
kSkrkAkc.
Proof The proof is the same as that of Theorem 2.2, even though the meaning of
the product sijaij is not identical to the meaning of the product kijlij which appears
in the previous proof.
It is also possible to apply the theorem directly and think of both S and A as
elements in MJ.B.H//.

The Basic Example
The results we present in this article are based on some well known aspects of
elementary harmonic analysis. The unit circle T is equipped with the Hilbert space
H WD L2.T; .1=2/d/ based on the Haar probability measure, and the self-adjoint
operator D WD .1=i/ d
d is just differentiation with respect to arc length, multiplied
by i. Basic Fourier analysis tells us that H has an orthonormal basis en WD ein of
eigenvectors for D and with respect to this basis D has a matrix representation as a
diagonal matrix with all the integers as the diagonal elements. Our basic observation
is that if y is a bounded operator on H with matrix .yij/ with respect to the basis
.en/; then the commutator ŒD; y makes sense as an inﬁnite matrix even if there is no
densely deﬁned operator associated to this expression. Further, the commutator may
be described as a Schur product of the matrix .yij/ by the matrix S D .Sij/ given as
Sij D .i  j/. If g is a complex function on Z; then we see that if we deﬁne a matrix
S WD .Sij/
Sij WD

then the commutator Œg.D/; y has a matrix which is given as the Schur product .Sij/
.ŒD; yij/. The next sections will show some examples on how this basic relation may
be transformed, so that it works for a general self-adjoint operator D; which may
have a non-trivial continuous spectrum.

The Space MD of Inﬁnite Matrices Associated with D
Let D be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H and y a bounded operator on
H; then we follow [1], and say that y is n times weakly D-differentiable, if for any
pair of vectors ; 
 in H the function
R 3 t ! heitDyeitD; 
i
is n times differentiable. In the articles [3] and [4] we presented several equivalent
properties to being n-times weakly D-differentiable and pointed out that most of
these may be found in the text book [1], however one point of view was original,
and we will recover the set up for this property here in order to set the stage for the
arguments to come. If y is weakly D-differentiable, then we introduced the weak
D-derivative ı.y/ in the introduction, and we quote from [4], that if y is weakly
D-differentiable, then
8; 
 2 H W

i D heitDı.y/eitD; 
i
dom.ŒD; y/ D dom.D/
and
ı.y/
ˇˇdom.D/ D iŒD; y:
For an arbitrary bounded operator y the expression iŒD; y is an operator on H; but
it may have a small domain of deﬁnition, and it may not even be densely deﬁned.
In the basic example in Sect. 3 the commutator iŒD; y always exists as an inﬁnite
matrix, and we will now present our way of transforming this set up to the case
where the spectrum of D has a continuous part.
Given the self-adjoint operator D we deﬁne a sequence of spectral projections en
for D; indexed over the integers Z; by deﬁning en as the spectral projection for D
corresponding to the interval Œn  .1=2/; n C .1=2/Œ. Many of these projections may
vanish, but this will have no effect on the computations to come. Then we deﬁne
MD as a space of matrices where the entries are bounded operators by
MD WD f.xij/ W i; j 2 Z; and xij 2 eiB.H/ej g:
Any bounded operator y on H has a natural representative m.y/ in MD which is
given by
m.y/ij WD eiyej:

Commutator Inequalities via Schur Products
133
For each integer j the operator dj WD Dej is bounded, deﬁned on all of H and an
element in ejB.H/ej; so we can deﬁne an element m.D/ in MD by
m.D/ij WD
(
0 if i ¤ j
dj if i D j:
For any element x in MD the commutator Œm.D/; x is a well deﬁned element in
MD which we denote d.x/ D

d.x/ij

and it is given by
d.x/ij WD Œm.D/; xij WD dixij  xijdj:
In this way, any iterated commutator such as dk.x/ D Œm.D/; Œm.D/; : : : Œm.D/; x
: : :  is meaningful and we showed in [4] that a bounded operator y on H is n times
weakly D-differentiable if and only if all the iterated commutators dk
m.y/

for
1  k  n represent bounded operators on H.
It is—of course—still just as difﬁcult to prove boundedness for matrices as to
establish boundedness on a given domain of vectors, but the matrix language makes
it possible to assign a meaning to the expression ŒD; y in situations where the
operator theoretical meaning is not existing. Further, the mapping d W MD ! MD
is clearly linear even if there may exist bounded operators y and z on H such that
ŒD; y C z ¤ ŒD; y C ŒD; z.
There is still another advantage in working with MD; namely that MD is left
invariant by Schur multiplication by scalar matrices S D .Sij/.i;j2Z/. We realized this
phenomenon, when working with the unit circle T as described in Sect. 3. In that
section we describe how the matrix of a commutator Œg.D/; y may be obtained as a
Schur product of a scalar matrix .Sij/ and the matrix for the commutator ŒD; y. It is
not possible to lift this simple identity to the case where D has continuous spectrum,
since
Œm.D/; m.y/ij D diyij  yijdj
and in general the expression djyij is not deﬁned, so we cannot imitate the expression
.i  j/yij from the basic example. The general strategy in the sections to come is to
replace D by a perturbed operator D with pure point spectrum, such that D  D is
bounded and satisﬁes kD  Dk  1=2. We deﬁne D as a Borel function of D.

It is now easy to check that for any bounded operator y we have

so differentiation with respect to D may be expressed as a Schur product.

On kŒg.D/; yk for Some Borel Functions g.t/
The usage of the Schur product, inside the space of matrices MD in the study
of commutators of the type Œg.D/; x; is easily demonstrated when g.t/ is Hölder
continuous, i.e. there exist positive constants ˛ and C such that for any real numbers
s and t we have jg.s/  g.t/j  Cjs  tj˛. In this case we say that g.t/ is .˛; C/
Hölder continuous. However, it turns out that the proof of such a result does not
need as strong a property as Hölder continuity, instead we only need a property
which we deﬁne below and denote Hölder boundedness.
Deﬁnition 5.1 Let ˛ > 0; A  0; B  0 and g.t/ be a complex Borel function on
R; then g.t/ is said to be .˛; A; B/ Hölder bounded if
8 s; t 2 R W
jg.s/  g.t/j  A C Bjs  tj˛:
We have searched the literature for places where this property has been used or
studied, but so far without any success.
It should be remarked, that the methods we propose also may ﬁt to situations
where g.t/ is only deﬁned and Hölder bounded on a subset of R containing the
spectrum of D, but the details needed for a general theorem seems to be somewhat
complex, so we suggest that possible extensions in this directions are made on an
ad hoc basis, if needed.
Theorem 5.2 Let D be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space and let g.t/ be an
.˛; A; B/ Hölder bounded Borel function on R. Let n be the smallest integer such that
n > ˛ C1=2 and y be a bounded operator which is n-times weakly D-differentiable.
Then y is weakly g.D/differentiable and

Proof We will use the discrete approximant D as introduced in (4.1), and we note
from (4.2) that the difference D  D is bounded, with closure b and of norm at most
1=2. Then by the functional calculus for D we ﬁnd that the difference g.D/g.D/ is
densely deﬁned and bounded of norm at most A C B.1=2/˛  A C B. This implies,

This inequality may be used to compare expressions like kŒg.D/; yk and

exists a theory of interpolation in Banach spaces, [8], and it is well known that it is

C-Algebras Associated with Algebraic Actions
Joachim Cuntz
Abstract This is a survey of work in which the author was involved in recent
years. We consider C*-algebras constructed from representations of one or several
algebraic endomorphisms of a compact abelian group—or, dually, of a discrete
abelian group. In our survey we do not try to describe the entire scope of the methods
and results obtained in the original papers, but we concentrate on the important
thread coming from the action of the multiplicative semigroup of the ring of integers
in an algebraic number ﬁeld, or more generally of a Dedekind ring, on its additive
group. Representations of such actions give rise to particularly intriguing problems
and the study of the corresponding C*-algebras has motivated many of the new
methods and general results obtained in this area.
1
Introduction
By an algebraic action we mean here an action of a semigroup by algebraic
endomorphisms of a compact abelian group or, dually, by endomorphisms of a
discrete abelian group. Such actions are much studied in ergodic theory but they also
give rise to interesting C*-algebras. In fact, quite a few of the standard examples of
simple C*-algebras such as On-algebras, Bunce-Deddens algebras, UHF-algebras
etc. arise from canonical representations of such endomorphisms. But the class of
C*-algebras obtained from general algebraic actions is much vaster and exhibits
new interesting phenomena.
We start our survey with the discussion, following [12], of the C*-algebra
AŒ˛ generated by the so called Koopman representation on L2H of a single
endomorphism ˛, satisfying natural conditions, of a compact abelian group H,
together with the natural representation of C.H/. This C*-algebra is always simple
purely inﬁnite and can be described by a natural set of generators and relations. It
contains a canonical maximal commutative C*-algebra D with spectrum a Cantor
space. This subalgebra is generated by the range projections snsn, where s is the
isometry implementing the given endomorphism, and by their conjugates usnsnu

under the unitaries u given by the characters  of H. Then, the subalgebra B
generated by D together with the u is of Bunce-Deddens type and simple with
unique trace. Moreover, AŒ˛ can be considered as a crossed product of B by a
single endomorphism.
The next case we consider is the C*-algebra generated analogously by the
Koopman representation of a family of commuting endomorphisms. We consider
the important special case of endomorphisms arising from the ring of integers
R in a number ﬁeld K. The multiplicative semigroup R acts by commuting
endomorphisms on the additive group R Š Zn or equivalently on the dual group
bR Š Tn (n being the degree of the ﬁeld extension K over Q). The commutative
semigroup R has a non-trivial structure and acts by interesting endomorphisms on
Tn. The study of the C*-algebra AŒR generated by the Koopman representation
in this situation goes back to [5] and was originally motivated by connections to
Bost-Connes systems [2].
Again, AŒR is simple purely inﬁnite and is described by natural generators
and relations. It has analogous subalgebras D and B, and AŒR can be viewed as
a semigroup crossed product B Ì R. The new and challenging problem is the
computation of the K-theory of AŒR. The key to this computation is a duality result
for adele-groups and corresponding crossed products, [10].
Since AŒR is generated by the Koopman representation, on `2R, of the semidirect
product semigroup R Ì R, the next very natural step in our program is the
consideration of the C*-algebra generated by the natural representation of this
semigroup on `2.R Ì R/ rather than on `2R, i.e. of the left regular C*-algebra
C
.R Ì R/. This algebra is still purely inﬁnite but no longer simple. It can be
described by natural generators and relations. The algebra AŒR is a quotient of
C
.R Ì R/ and the latter algebra is deﬁned by relaxing the relations deﬁning AŒR
in a systematic way. The best way to do so is to add a family of projections, indexed
by the ideals of the ring R, as additional generators and to incorporate those into the
relations. This way of deﬁning the relations also guided Xin Li in his description of
the left regular C*-algebras for more general semigroups [19].
The (non-trivial) problem of computing the K-theory of C
.RÌR/ turned out to
be particularly fruitful [7, 8]. It led to a powerful new method for computing the K-
groups, for regular C*-algebras of more general semigroups and of crossed products
by automorphic actions of such more general semigroups, as well as for crossed
products of certain actions of groups on totally disconnected spaces. In the special
case of C
.R Ì R/ we get the interesting result that the K-theory is described by
a formula that involves the basic number theoretic structure of the number ﬁeld K,
namely the ideal class group and the action of the group of units (invertible elements
in R) on the additive group of an ideal.
Finally, we include a brief discussion of the rich KMS-structure on C
.R Ì R/
for the natural one-parameter action on this C*-algebra. Just as the K-theory for
C
.RÌR/, this structure is related to the number theoretic invariants of R, resp. K.
Our goal in this survey is limited. We try to describe a leitmotif in this line of
research and to explain the connections and similarities between the various results.
The original articles contain much more information and many additional ﬁner,

more sophisticated and more general results which we omit completely. We also
do not describe the results in the order they were obtained originally, but rather in
the order which seems more systematic with hindsight.

Single Algebraic Endomorphisms
Let H be a compact abelian group and G D bH its dual discrete group. We assume
that G is countable. Let ˛ be a surjective endomorphism of H with ﬁnite kernel.
We denote by ' the dual endomorphism  7!  ı ˛ of G (i.e. ' D b˛). By duality,
' is injective and has ﬁnite cokernel, i.e. the quotient G='G will be ﬁnite. Both ˛
and ' induce isometric endomorphisms s˛ and s' of the Hilbert spaces L2H and
`2G, respectively. This isometric representation of ˛ on L2H is called the Koopman
representation in ergodic theory.
We will also assume that
\
n2N
'nG D f0g
which, by duality, means that
[
n2N
Ker ˛n
is dense in H (this implies in particular that H and G cannot be ﬁnite). These
conditions on ˛ are quite natural and for instance apply to the usual examples
considered in ergodic theory. We list a few important examples of compact groups
and endomorphisms satisfying our conditions at the end of this section.
We want to describe the C*-algebra C.s˛; C.H// generated in L .L2H/ by
C.H/, acting by multiplication operators, and by the isometry s˛. Via Fourier
transform it is isomorphic to the C*-algebra C.s'; CG/ generated in L .`2G/ by
CG, acting via the left regular representation, and by the isometry s'. These two
unitarily equivalent representations are useful for different purposes.
Now, C.s'; CG/ is generated by the isometry s D s' together with the unitary
operators ug; g 2 G and these operators satisfy the relations
uguh D ugCh
sug D u'.g/s
X
g2G='G
ugssu
g D 1
(2.1)
Deﬁnition 2.1 Let H; G and ˛; ' be as above. We denote by AŒ' the universal C*-
algebra generated by an isometry s and unitary operators ug; g 2 G satisfying the
relations (2.1).

148
J. Cuntz
It is shown in [12] that AŒ' Š C.s˛; C.H// Š C.s'; CG/, i.e. that the natural
map from the universal C*-algebra to the C*-algebra generated by the concrete
Koopman representation is an isomorphism. Particular situations of interest arise
when H D .Z=n/1 with ˛ the left shift (this gives rise to AŒ' Š On) or when
H D Tn.
Lemma 2.2 The C*-subalgebra D of AŒ' generated by all projections of the form
ugsnsnu
g, g 2 G; n 2 N is commutative. Its spectrum is the “'-adic completion”
G' D lim
 n G='nG
It is an inverse limit of the ﬁnite spaces G='nG and becomes a Cantor space with
the natural topology.
G acts on D via d 7! ugdu
g, g 2 G; d 2 D. This action corresponds to the
natural action of the dense subgroup G on its completion G' via translation. The
map D ! D given by x 7! sxs corresponds to the map induced by ' on G'.
From now on we will denote the compact abelian group G' by M. By construc-
tion, G is a dense subgroup of M. The dual group of M is the discrete abelian group
L D lim
!n Ker .˛n W H ! H/
Because of the condition that we impose on ˛, L can be considered as a dense
subgroup of H.
The groups M and L play an important role in the analysis of AŒ'. They are in a
sense complementary to H and G. By Lemma 2.2, the C*-algebra D is isomorphic
to C.M/ and to C.L/.
Theorem 2.3 The C*-subalgebra B' of AŒ' generated by C.H/ together with
C.M/ (or equivalently by CG together with CL) is isomorphic to the crossed
product C.M/ Ì G. It is simple and has a unique trace.
The map x 7! sxs deﬁnes a natural endomorphism ' of B'.
Theorem 2.4 The algebra AŒ' is simple, nuclear and purely inﬁnite. Moreover, it
is isomorphic to the semigroup crossed product B' Ì' N (i.e. to the universal unital
C*-algebra generated by B' together with an isometry t such that txt D '.x/,
x 2 B').
The fact that AŒ' is a crossed product B' Ì N can be used to prove the following
Theorem 2.5 (cf. [12]) The K-groups of AŒ' ﬁt into an exact sequence as follows
(2.2)
where the map b.'/ W KC.H/ ! KC.H/ satisﬁes b.'/˛ D N.˛/id with N.˛/ WD
jKer ˛j.

C-Algebras Associated with Algebraic Actions
149
In [12], the analysis of AŒ' and the formula (2.2) for its K-theory was also extended
to the case where ˛ is replaced by a so called rational polymorphism.
There are quite a few papers in the literature containing special cases or parts
of the results described in this section. We mention only [15] where it was shown
that AŒ' is simple and characterized by generators and relations and [14] where in
particular a formula similar to (2.2) was derived for an expansive endomorphism of
Tn—both papers using methods different from [12].
2.1
Examples
Here are some examples of endomorphisms in the class we consider.
1. Let H D Q
k2N Z=n, G D L
k2N Z=n and ˛ the one-sided shift on H deﬁned by
˛..ak// D .akC1/.
We obtain M D Q
k2N Z=n Š H and L D L
k2N Z=n Š G. The algebra B' is
a UHF-algebra of type n1 and AŒ' is isomorphic to On. It is interesting to note
that the UHF-algebra B' is generated by two maximal abelian subalgebras both
isomorphic to C.M/.
2. Let H D T, G D Z and ˛ the endomorphism of H deﬁned by ˛.z/ D zn. The
algebra B' is a Bunce-Deddens-algebra of type n1 and AŒ' is isomorphic to
a natural subalgebra of the algebra QN considered in [5]. In this case, we also
get for B' the interesting isomorphism C.Zn/ Ì Z Š C.T/ Ì L where Z acts on
the Cantor space Zn by the odometer action (addition of 1) and L denotes the
subgroup of T given by all nk-th roots of unity, acting on T by translation.
3. Let H D Tn, G D Zn and ˛ an endomorphism of H determined by an integral
matrix T with non-zero determinant. We assume that the condition
\
n2N
'nG D f0g
is satisﬁed (this is in fact not very restrictive).
The algebra B' is a higher-dimensional analogue of a Bunce-Deddens-
algebra. In the case where H is the additive group of the ring R of algebraic
integers in a number ﬁeld of degree n and the matrix T corresponds to an element
of R, the algebra AŒ' is isomorphic to a natural subalgebra of the algebra AŒR
considered in the following section. It is also isomorphic to the algebra studied
in [14].
4. As another natural example related to number theory consider the additive group
of the polynomial ring FpŒt over a ﬁnite ﬁeld. An endomorphism satisfying our
conditions is given by multiplication by a non-zero element in FpŒt. In this case
AŒ' is related to certain graph C*-algebras, see [11].
5. Let p and q be natural numbers that are relatively prime and  the endomorphism
of T deﬁned by z 7! zp.

150
J. Cuntz
We take

 


G D ZŒ1
p
˛q the endomorphism of H induced by z 7! zq and 'q the endomorphism of G
deﬁned by 'q.x/ D qx. These endomorphisms satisfy our hypotheses. We ﬁnd that
M D Zq (the q-adic completion of Z).
In all these examples one can work out the K-theory of AŒ' using formula (2.2),
see [12].

Actions by a Family of Endomorphisms, Ring C*-Algebras
It is a natural problem to extend the results of Sect. 2 to actions of a family
(semigroup) of several commuting endomorphisms of a compact abelian group,
satisfying the conditions of Sect. 2. It turns out that the structural results such as
simplicity, pure inﬁniteness, canonical subalgebras carry over without problem.
However the computation of the K-groups needs completely new ideas.
The most prominent example for us arises as follows. Let K be a number ﬁeld, i.e.
a ﬁnite algebraic extension of Q. The ring of algebraic integers R  K is deﬁned as
the integral closure of Z in K, i.e. as the set of elements a 2 K that annihilate some
monic polynomial with coefﬁcients in Z. This ring is always a Dedekind domain (a
Dedekind domain is by deﬁnition an integral domain in which every nonzero proper
ideal factors into a product of prime ideals). It has many properties similar to the
ordinary ring of integers Z  Q, but it is not a principal ideal domain in general.
Its additive group is always isomorphic to Zn where n is the degree of the ﬁeld
extension.
Consider the multiplicative semigroup R D R n f0g of R. It acts as endomor-
phisms on the additive group R and thus also on the compact abelian dual group
bR Š Tn. Such endomorphisms of Tn are a frequent object of study in ergodic theory.
If R is not a principal ideal domain, the semigroup R has an interesting structure.
As in Sect. 2 we consider the Koopman representation of R on L2bR Š `2R.
Deﬁnition 3.1 We deﬁne the ‘ring C*-algebra’ AŒR as the C*-algebra generated
by C.bR/ and R on L2.bR/ (or equivalently as the C*-algebra generated by the action
of C.R/ and of R on `2R).
AŒR is generated by the isometries sn, n 2 R and the unitaries uj, j 2 R. The
sn deﬁne a representation of the abelian semigroup R by isometries, the uj deﬁne
a representation of the abelian group R by unitaries and together they satisfy the
relations
snuk D uknsn; k 2 R; n; m 2 R
X
j2R=nR
ujsns
n uj D 1
(3.1)

C-Algebras Associated with Algebraic Actions
151
The basic analysis of the structure of AŒR is completely parallel to the discussion
in Sect. 2 (in fact historically the article [9] preceded [12]). One obtains
Theorem 3.2 (cf. [9]) The C*-algebra AŒR is simple purely inﬁnite and nuclear. It
is the universal C*-algebra generated by a unitary representation u of R together
with an isometric representation s of R satisfying the relations (3.1).
As for AŒ' in Sect. 2 there are canonical subalgebras D and B of AŒR. The spec-
trum of the commutative C*-algebra D is a Cantor space canonically homeomorphic
to the maximal compact subring of the space of ﬁnite adeles for the number ﬁeld K.
The subalgebra B is generated by D together with the uj, j 2 R. It is simple and
has a unique trace (a higher dimensional Bunce-Deddens type algebra). The general
structure of C*-algebras associated like this with a ring has been developed further
by Xin Li in [18].
In order to compute the K-groups for AŒR the natural strategy would appear to
be an iteration of the formula (2.2) of Theorem 2.5. Since the proof of formula (2.2)
is based on the usual Pimsner-Voiculescu sequence this would amount to iterating
this sequence in order to compute the K-groups for the crossed product by Zn by
a commuting family of n automorphisms. However this strategy immediately runs
into problems since, assuming the K-groups for the crossed product by the ﬁrst
automorphism are determined, it is not at all clear how the second automorphism
will act on these groups. In other words, there is a spectral sequence abutting to the
K-theory for the crossed product by Zn, but it is useless for actual computations
without further knowledge of the higher boundary maps in the spectral sequence.
An analysis of relevant properties of the spectral sequence for actions as here is
contained in [1].
The key to the computation of the K-groups for AŒR in [10] is the following
duality result.
Theorem 3.3 Let Af and A1 denote the locally compact spaces of ﬁnite, resp.
inﬁnite adeles of K both with the natural action of the additive group K. Then the
crossed product C*-algebras C0.Af / Ì K and C0.A1/ Ì K are Morita equivalent,
equivariantly for the action of K on both algebras (with the inverted natural action
on the second algebra, i.e. K acts on A1 not by multiplication but by division).
Note that the space A1 is simply Rn where n is the degree of the ﬁeld extension.
From this theorem the K-groups of AŒR can be computed, at least in the case where
the only roots of unit in K are ˙1.
We explain this here only for the case where K D Q, R D Z. In this case
everything becomes rather concrete. The spectrum of the canonical commutative
subalgebra D is the proﬁnite completion Z of Z (we use here Z rather than the more
standard notation bZ in order not to create confusion with the dual group of Z). It is
homeomorphic to the inﬁnite product of the p-adic completions Zp for all primes p
in Z. Moreover Af is the restricted inﬁnite product of the Qp and A1 simply is R.

Thus Theorem 3.3 gives a Morita equivalence between C0.Af /ÌQ and C0.R/ÌQ.
Moreover the ﬁrst crossed product is Morita equivalent to the full corner B Š
C.Z/ Ì Z.
Denote by B0 the C*-algebra generated by B together with the symmetry s1,
i.e. B0 Š B Ì Z=2 for the action of s1. Since B0 Š .C.Z/ Ì Z/ Ì Z=2 is an
inductive limit of C..Z=nZ/ Ì Z/ Ì Z=2 and this latter algebra is isomorphic to
Mn.C.ZÌZ=2// it is not difﬁcult to compute the K-theory of B as K0.B0/ D Z˚Q
and K1.B0/ D 0.
Now, we can use the Pimsner-Voiculescu sequence to compute the K-theory of
the crossed product A1 D B0 Ì N D C.B0; s2/ as
K0.A1/ D Z
K1.A1/ D Z
By a slight reﬁnement of the statement in Theorem 3.3, A1 is Morita equivalent
to .C0.R/ Ì Q/ Ì .Z=2  Z/ where Z=2  Z acts by multiplication by 1 and by 2.
Denote now by An the C*-algebra generated by B0 together with the sp1; : : : ; spn,
where p1; : : : ; pn denote the ﬁrst n prime numbers (with p1 D 2). Then again An is
Morita equivalent to .C0.R/ Ì Q/ Ì .Z=2  Zn/, where Z=2 acts by multiplication
by 1 and Zn by multiplication by p1; : : : ; pn. Moreover AŒR is the inductive limit
of the An.
We can now consider the canonical inclusions
n W C0.R/ Ì .Z=2  Zn/ ! .C0.R/ Ì Q/ Ì .Z=2  Zn/ Morita An
(3.2)
into the crossed product where we leave out the action of the additive Q by
translation on the left hand side.
By the discussion above, 1 induces an isomorphism in K-theory. Now we obtain
nC1 from n by taking the crossed product by Z (acting by multiplication by pnC1)
on both sides in (3.2). Therefore, applying the Pimsner-Voiculescu sequence on both
sides, we deduce, using the ﬁve-lemma, from the fact that n induces an isomorphism
on K-theory that the same holds for nC1. The important point is that the action
of Zn on the left hand side is homotopic to the trivial action, simply because
multiplication by p1; : : : ; pn is homotopic to multiplication by 1 on R. Therefore
K.An/ Š K..C0.R/ Ì Z=2/ ˝ CZn/.
As a consequence we obtain
Theorem 3.4 ([10]) The map n induces an isomorphism on K-theory for all n. The
K-theory of AŒR is isomorphic to the K-theory of .C0.R/ Ì Z=2/ Ì Q.
Note that the K-theory of C0.R/ÌZ=2 is the same as the one of C and that therefore
the K-theory of AŒR is the same as the one of an inﬁnite-dimensional torus.
The argument that we sketched for K D Q works in a very similar, though
somewhat more involved way for a number ﬁeld with ˙1 as only roots of unit.
In this case one has to determine the K-theory of C0.Rn/ Ì Z=2 rather than that of
C0.R/ Ì Z=2. The case of an arbitrary number ﬁeld K can be treated in the same
fashion. The important difference comes from the more general group .K/ of roots

of unit. For the computation one needs non-trivial information on the K-theory of
the crossed product C0.Rn/ Ì .K/ and thus on the equivariant K-theory of Rn with
respect to the action of .K/. This non-trivial computation has been carried through
by Li and Lück in [21] using previous work by Langer and Lück [17].
The analysis of the structure and of the K-theory of AŒR can also be carried out
in the case where R is a polynomial ring over a ﬁnite ﬁeld (ring of integers in a
certain function ﬁeld). The structure of the C*-algebra in this case is more closely
related to the example of the shift endomorphism of .Z=pZ/1 mentioned above and
to certain Cuntz-Krieger algebras. Nevertheless for the computation of the K-theory
one can again use the duality result in Theorem 3.3 and the result for the K-theory
is again similar, [11].

Regular C*-Algebra for ‘ax+b’-Semigroups
By deﬁnition, the ring C*-algebra AŒR discussed in Sect. 3 is obtained from the
natural representations of C.R/ Š C.bR/ and of the semigroup R on the Hilbert
space `2R Š L2.bR/. Another way to view this is to say that it is deﬁned by the
natural representation of the semidirect product semigroup R Ì R on `2R.
Now, this semidirect product semigroup has an even more natural representation,
given by the left regular representation on the Hilbert space `2.R Ì R/. The study
of the left regular C*-algebra C
.R Ì R/ was begun in [6]. This C*-algebra is no
longer simple but still purely inﬁnite and has an intriguing structure. In particular, it
has a very interesting KMS-structure and the determination of its K-theory leads to
new challenging problems.
The ﬁrst obvious observation concerning C
.R Ì R/ is that, just as AŒR,
it is generated by a unitary representation ux; x 2 R of the additive group R
and a representation by isometries sa; a 2 R of the multiplicative semigroup
R satisfying the additional relation saux D uaxsa. However the last relation
P
x2R=aR uxsas
aux D 1 in (3.1) becomes
X
x2R=aR
uxsas
a ux  1
(4.1)
In fact, it turns out that this weakened relation (4.1) (of course together with
the relations on the ux; sa in the previous paragraph) determines C
.R Ì R/ in
the case where R is a principal ideal domain. The general case however is more
intricate. In general, it is still possible to describe C
.R Ì R/ by natural deﬁning
relations. However the most natural way to do so uses an incorporation of the natural
idempotents obtained as range projections of the partial isometries given by products
of the ux, sa and their adjoints. It turns out that these range projections correspond
exactly to the ideals of R.

154
J. Cuntz
The generators singled out in [6] then are ux; x 2 R; sa; a 2 R; eI, I a non-zero
ideal in R. The relations are
1. The ux are unitary and satisfy uxuy D uxCy, the sa are isometries and satisfy
sasb D sab. Moreover saux D uaxsa for all x 2 R; a 2 R.
2. The eI are projections and satisfy eI\J D eIeJ, eR D 1.
3. We have saeI D eaIsa.
4. For x 2 I one has uxeI D eIux, for x … I one has eIuxeI D 0.
The universal C*-algebra with these generators and relations is no longer simple
but in most respects its structure is similar to the one of AŒR. There is a canonical
maximal commutative subalgebra D with totally disconnected spectrum (generated
by the eI), and a Bunce-Deddens type subalgebra B generated by D together with
the ux, x 2 R. Using this structure one shows
Theorem 4.1 (cf. [6]) The universal C*-algebra with generators ux, sa, eI satis-
fying the relations 1.,2.,3.,4. above is canonically isomorphic to C
.R Ì R/. As
a consequence C
.R Ì R/ is also isomorphic to the semigroup crossed product
D Ì .R Ì R/ (i.e. to the universal C*-algebra generated by D together with
a representation of the semigroup R Ì R by isometries implementing the given
endomorphisms of D).
It follows that AŒR is a quotient of C
.RÌR/. As mentioned above, in the simplest
case AŒR is obtained from C
.R Ì R/ by ‘tightening’ the relation
X
j2R=nR
ujsns
nuj  1
to P
j2R=nR ujsns
n uj D 1. This kind of tightening has occurred in many places in
the literature under the name tight representation or boundary quotient etc.
The relations 1., 2., 3., 4. above turned out to also give the right framework for
describing the left regular C*-algebra of more general semigroups. The theory of
these regular C*-algebras has been developed by Xin Li [19, 20].
As in Sect. 3 the key to the computation of K.C
.R Ì R//, for the ring R of
integers in a number ﬁeld K, lies in a KK-equivalence between the given action by
endomorphisms of our semigroup with a basically trivial situation.
The semigroup S D R Ì R admits G D K Ì K as a canonical enveloping
group. The action of S on the commutative subalgebra D of C
.R Ì R/ has a
natural dilation to an action of G. This means that D can be embedded into a larger
commutative C*-algebra C  D with an action of G which extends the action of
S on D (this uses the fact that S is a directed set ordered by right divisibility). The
crossed product C Ì G is then Morita equivalent to D Ì S Š C
.R Ì R/ (the last
isomorphism follows from Theorem 4.1).
A fractional ideal in K is a subset J of K of the form J D aI where I is an ideal
in R and a 2 K. Denote by J the set of all fractional ideals of R in K, i.e. the set
of all translates in K of ideals in R under the action of K.

C-Algebras Associated with Algebraic Actions
155
It is easy to see that, in the dilated system, there is a bijection J 7! eJ between J
and the translates under G of the projections eI, I ideal in R. Moreover the eJ, J 2 J
generate C  D. Using the fact that R is a Dedekind domain it is not difﬁcult to
show that the family feJg forms a regular basis of C in the sense of the following
deﬁnition. The importance of the regularity condition (or, in another guise, of the
‘independence’ of the family of constructible left ideals of the semigroup) has been
noticed by Xin Li.
Deﬁnition 4.2 If feJ W J 2 J g is a countable set of non-zero projections in a
commutative C*-algebra C , we say that feJg is a regular basis for C if it is linearly
independent, closed under multiplication (up to 0) and generates C as a C*-algebra
(this means that span feJ W J 2 J g is a dense subalgebra of C ).
Now the group G acts on C , on J and on the algebra K D K .`2.J // of compact
operators. We can trivially deﬁne an equivariant *-homomorphism  W C0.J / !
K ˝ C by mapping ıJ to "J ˝ eJ. Here, ıJ denotes the indicator function of the
one-point set fJg and "J denotes the matrix in K which is 1 in the diagonal place
.J; J/ and 0 otherwise (matrix unit).
Theorem 4.3 ([7, 8]) The equivariant map  induces an isomorphism
K.C0.J / Ì G/ ! K.C Ì G/ Š K.C
.R Ì R//
But now, by Green’s imprimitivity theorem the crossed product C0.J / Ì G is
simply Morita equivalent to the direct sum, over the G-orbits in J , of the C*-
algebras of the stabilizer groups of each orbit.
Deﬁnition 4.4 The ideal class group ClK is the quotient of the semigroup of
fractional ideals in K under the equivalence relation where J is equivalent to J0
iff there is a 2 K such that J0 D aJ.
If R is the ring of algebraic integers in the number ﬁeld K, then the class group is a
ﬁnite abelian group.
Two fractional ideals J and J0 are in the same orbit for G if and only if there
is a 2 K such that J0 D aJ. Therefore, by Deﬁnition 4.4 the orbits are labeled
exactly by the elements of the class group ClK. The stabilizer group of the class of
a fractional ideal J then is given by the semidirect product J Ì R of the additive
group J by the group R of units (i.e. of invertible elements in R). As a corollary
to Theorem 4.3 we thus obtain
Corollary 4.5 For each element  of the class group ClK choose any ideal I
representing the class . Then

In the situation at hand, Theorem 4.3 can be proven directly—essentially in a
similar way as at the end of Sect. 3 using the equivariant map . There is however a

156
J. Cuntz
much more powerful approach based on techniques from work on the Baum-Connes
conjecture developed by Echterhoff and others [4, 13]. They establish the following
principle:
Assume that the group G satisﬁes the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefﬁcients in the G-
algebras A and B. Let  W A ! B be an equivariant homomorphism which induces, via
descent, isomorphisms K.A Ì H/ Š K.B Ì H/ for all compact subgroups H of G. Then
 also induces an isomorphism K.A Ìr G/ Š K.B Ìr G/.
Theorem 4.3 then follows from checking that the equivariant map C0.J / !
K ˝ C used there satisﬁes this condition for all ﬁnite subgroups of G.
This approach to Theorem 4.3 has a much broader scope of applications. It allows
to extend the argument to general actions of a group G, that satisﬁes the Baum-
Connes conjecture with coefﬁcients, on a commutative C*-algebra C admitting a
G-invariant regular basis of projections in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.2. In particular,
it can then be used to compute the K-theory of the left regular C*-algebra for a
large class of semigroups as well as for crossed products by automorphic actions
by such semigroups. Moreover this more general method also allows to compute
the K-theory for crossed products for an action of a group on a totally disconnected
space that admits an invariant regular basis as in Deﬁnition 4.2, [7, 8].
For instance, one obtains
Theorem 4.6 ([7]) Let R be a Dedekind domain with quotient ﬁeld Q.R/ and A a
C*-algebra. Then the following are true:
1. For every action ˛ W R ! Aut .A/ there is a canonical isomorphism
K.A Ì˛;r R/ Š
M
2ClQ.R/
K.A Ì˛;r R/:

The above method of computing K-theory for semigroup C*-algebras and
for certain crossed products for actions on totally disconnected spaces has been
developed further by Li-Norling in [22, 23].

KMS-States
To end this survey we brieﬂy discuss the KMS-structure for the natural one-
parameter automorphism group of C
.R Ì R/ where, again, R is the ring of
algebraic integers in a number ﬁeld K. After all, part of the motivation for the study
of ring C*-algebras came from Bost-Connes systems and a main feature of such
systems is the rich KMS-structure. Also, one of the reasons in [6] for passing from
the ring C*-algebra AŒR to C
.R Ì R/ was the existence of many KMS-states on
the latter algebra.
Recall that, for a non-zero ideal I in R, we denote by N.I/ the norm of I, i.e.
the number N.I/ D jR=Ij of elements in R=I. For a 2 R we also write N.a/ D
N.aR/. The norm is multiplicative, [25]. Using the norm one deﬁnes a natural one-
parameter automorphism group .t/t2R on C
.R Ì R/, given on the generators by
t.ux/ D ux
t.eI/ D eI
t.sa/ D N.a/itsa
(this assignment manifestly respects the relations between the generators and thus
induces an automorphism). Let ˇ be a real number  0. Recall that a ˇ-KMS state
with respect to a one-parameter automorphism group .t/t2R is a state ' which
satisﬁes '.yx/ D '.xiˇ.y// for a dense set of analytic vectors x; y and for the
natural extension of .t/ to complex parameters on analytic vectors, [3]. For the
one-parameter automorphism group , deﬁned above, the ˇ-KMS condition for a
state ' translates to
'.uxz/ D '.z ux/
'.eIz/ D '.z eI/
'.saz/ D N.a/ˇ'.z sa/
(5.1)
for a set of analytic vectors z with dense linear span and for the standard generators
ux, eI, sa of C
.R Ì R/.
Theorem 5.1 ([6]) The KMS-states on C
.R Ì R/ at inverse temperature ˇ can
be described. One has
1. no KMS-states for ˇ < 1.
2. for each ˇ 2 Œ1; 2 a unique ˇ-KMS state.
3. for ˇ 2 .2; 1/ a bijection between ˇ-KMS states and traces on
M
2ClK
C.I/ Ì R
where ClK is the ideal class group, I is any ideal representing  and R denotes
the multiplicative group of invertible elements in R (units).
The simpler case of Theorem 5.1, where R D Z; K D Q, had essentially been
treated already by Laca-Raeburn in [16]. The ﬁrst assertion in Theorem 5.1 is
basically obvious. The proof, in [6], of point 3. uses special representations of
C
.R Ì R/ which seem to be of independent interest. The proof of 2. in [6] uses

158
J. Cuntz
a result, also of some independent interest, on asymptotics of partial Dedekind -
functions. An alternative subsequent proof of Theorem 5.1, due to Neshveyev, is
obtained by relating the problem to a general result on KMS-states for C*-algebras
of non-principal groupoids, [24].
There is a striking parallel between the formula for the KMS-states for ˇ > 2 in
the theorem above and the formula for the K-theory of C
.RÌR/ in Corollary 4.5.
The K-theory is isomorphic to the K-theory of the C*-algebra L
2 C.I/ Ì R
while the simplex of KMS-states is in bijection with the traces of this direct sum
C*-algebra. Note that both results are quite non-trivial, as L
2 C.I/ Ì R is not
a natural subalgebra of C
.R Ì R/.

A New Look at C-Simplicity and the Unique
Trace Property of a Group
Uffe Haagerup
Abstract We characterize when the reduced C-algebra of a non-trivial group has
unique tracial state, respectively, is simple, in terms of Dixmier-type properties of
the group C-algebra. We also give a simple proof of the recent result by Breuillard,
Kalantar, Kennedy and Ozawa that the reduced C-algebra of a group has unique
tracial state if and only if the amenable radical of the group is trivial.

Introduction
It was shown by Murray and von Neumann that the von Neumann algebra L .G/ of
a group G is a factor (necessarily of type II1) if and only if the group G is ICC (all
non-trivial conjugacy classes are inﬁnite). The analogous problem for the reduced
group C-algebra C
.G/ of the group G, namely characterizing when C
.G/ is
simple, respectively, when does it have a unique tracial state, turned out to be far
more subtle. Powers, [11], proved in 1975 that the reduced group C-algebra of
the free groups (or order  2) is simple and has unique tracial state. His result has
since then been vastly generalized. Prompted by the observation that (a) and (b)
below separately imply condition (c), see, for example [7], the question arose if the
following three conditions for a group G are equivalent:
(a) C
.G/ is simple (i.e., G is C-simple),
(b) C
.G/ has unique tracial state (i.e., G has the unique trace property),
(c) the amenable radical of G is trivial.
Uffe Haagerup tragically passed away on July 5, 2015. The results in this article were proven by
Haagerup in the early Spring of 2015, and privately communicated to his (and Magdalena Musat’s)
PhD student Kristian Knudsen Olesen in May 2015. Based on this, Kristian Knudsen Olesen,
Magdalena Musat and Mikael Rørdam (University of Copenhagen, Denmark) have written up this
paper.

Kalantar and Kennedy proved in [8] that C-simplicity of a group is equivalent to the
group having a (topologically) free boundary action. In 2014, Breuillard, Kalantar,
Kennedy and Ozawa, [2], used this to prove that (b) and (c) are equivalent, and hence
that (a) implies (b). The picture of the interconnections between the three properties
above was ﬁnally completed very recently by Le Boudec, [1], who gave examples
of groups that have the unique trace property, but are not C-simple. Hence (b) does
not imply (a). Simple C-algebras in general need not have unique tracial state. For
example, any metrizable Choquet simplex arises as the trace simplex of a unital
simple AF-algebra, [4].
In this article we give new characterizations of when a group has the unique
trace property and when it is C-simple in terms of (intrinsic) Dixmier-type
properties of the group C-algebra. We also give a more direct proof of the
theorem by Breuillard, Kalantar, Kennedy and Ozawa that the unique trace property
is equivalent to triviality of the amenable radical of the group. This proof uses
Furman’s characterization (cf. [5]) of the amenable radical of a group as consisting
of those elements that act trivially under any boundary action.
In the very recent preprint [9], Kennedy has independently obtained results
similar to those in Theorem 4.5 of this paper, characterizing when a group is C-
simple.

Boundary Actions
Recall that an action of a group1 G on a compact Hausdorff space X is said to be
strongly proximal if for each probability measure  on X, the weak-closure of the
orbit G: contains a point-mass ıx, for some x 2 X. An action G Õ X is said to be
a boundary action if it is strongly proximal and minimal. If this is the case, then for
each x 2 X and each probability measure  on X, there is a net .si/ in G such that
si: converges to ıx in the weak-topology. Recall also that the amenable radical of
G is deﬁned to be the largest normal amenable subgroup of G, and it is denoted by
Rad.G/.
Furman, [5], proved in 2003 the following result about (the existence of)
boundary actions of a group:
Theorem 2.1 (Furman) Let G be a group and let t 2 G. Then t … Rad.G/ if and
only if there is a boundary action of G on some compact Hausdorff space X such
that t acts non-trivially on X.
We denote by  the left-regular representation of the group G on `2.G/, and by
C
.G/ the (associated) reduced group C-algebra. A group G is said to be C-simple
if C
.G/ is a simple C-algebra, and it is said to have the unique trace property if
the canonical trace on C
.G/, here denoted by 0, is the only tracial state on C
.G/.
1Throughout the paper, groups are assumed to be discrete.

Kalantar and Kennedy proved in [8] that a group G is C-simple if and only if it
has a topologically free boundary action on some compact Hausdorff space. It was
observed in [2, Proposition 2.5] that the action of G on its universal boundary @FG
of G is free if it is topologically free, and hence that the following theorem holds:
Theorem 2.2 (Breuillard–Kalantar–Kennedy–Ozawa) Let G be a group. Then
C
.G/ is simple if and only if there is a free boundary action of G on some compact
Hausdorff space.

Groups with the Unique Trace Property
In this section we give a new and elementary proof of one of the main theorems
from [2], namely that a group has the unique trace property if and only if it has
trivial amenable radical. The proof uses Theorem 2.1 by Furman, quoted above.
When a group G acts on a compact Hausdorff space X, we can then form the
reduced crossed product C-algebra C.X/ÌrG, see [3, Chapter 4], which in a natural
way contains both C
.G/ and C.X/. These two subalgebras are related as follows:
.t/f.t/ D t:f, for all t 2 G and f 2 C.X/, where .t:f/.x/ D f.t1:x/, for x 2 X.
Lemma 3.1 Let G be a group acting on a compact Hausdorff space X, let x 2 X,
and let ' be a state on C.X/ Ìr G whose restriction to C.X/ is the point-evaluation
ıx. Then '..t// D 0, for each t 2 G for which t:x ¤ x.
Proof The assumptions in the lemma ensure that C.X/ is contained in the multi-
plicative domain of ', see [3, Proposition 1.5.7], so
'..t//f.x/ D '..t/f/ D '..t:f/.t// D f.t1:x/'..t//;
for each f 2 C.X/ and each t 2 G. This clearly entails that '..t// D 0 when
t1:x ¤ x, which again happens precisely when t:x ¤ x.
ut
If ' is a state on C
.G/, or on the crossed product C.X/ Ìr G, and if t 2 G, let
t:' denote the state given by .t:'/.a/ D '..t/a.t//, where a belongs to C
.G/,
respectively, to C.X/ Ìr G.
Lemma 3.2 Let  be a tracial state on C
.G/, let G Õ X be a boundary action,
and let x 2 X. Then  extends to a state on C.X/ Ìr G whose restriction to C.X/ is
point-evaluation ıx.
Proof Extend  to any state  on C.X/ Ìr G, and let  be the restriction of  to
C.X/. By the assumption that G Õ X is a boundary action, there is a net .si/ in G
such that si: converges to ıx in the weak-topology. By possibly passing to a subnet
we may assume that si: converges to some state ' on C.X/ Ìr G. The restriction
of ' to C.X/ is then equal to ıx. Moreover, since for all s; t 2 G,
.s: /..t// D  ..sts1// D ..sts1// D ..t//;

164
U. Haagerup
we see that '..t// D ..t//, for all t 2 G. This shows that ' and  agree on
C
.G/.
ut
We can now give a new and simpler proof of one of the main theorems from [2]:
Theorem 3.3 (Breuillard–Kalantar–Kennedy–Ozawa) Let G be a group and let
t 2 G. Then ..t// D 0, for every tracial state  on C
.G/, if and only if t …
Rad.G/. In particular, C
.G/ has a unique tracial state if and only if Rad.G/ is
trivial.
Proof Suppose ﬁrst that t … Rad.G/. Then by Theorem 2.1 (Furman), there is a
boundary action G Õ X such that t:x ¤ x, for some x 2 X. Let  be a tracial state
on C
.G/. By Lemma 3.2, there is a state ' on C.X/ Ìr G which extends  and
whose restriction to C.X/ is point-evaluation at x. By Lemma 3.1, it follows that
..t// D '..t// D 0.
The “only if” part follows from the well-known fact, see, for example, Propo-
sition 3 in [7] (and its proof therein), that whenever N is a normal amenable
subgroup of G, then the canonical homomorphism CG ! C.G=N/ extends to a
-homomorphism C
.G/ ! C
.G=N/. Using this fact with N D Rad.G/, and
composing the resulting -homomorphism C
.G/ ! C
.G= Rad.G// with the
canonical trace on C
.G= Rad.G//, we obtain a tracial state  on C
.G/ which
satisﬁes ..t// D 1, for all t 2 Rad.G/.
The last claim of the theorem follows from the fact that the canonical trace on
C
.G/ is the unique tracial state which vanishes on .t/, for all t ¤ e.

C-Simplicity and the Unique Trace Property of Groups
This section contains our main results that provide new characterizations of the
unique trace property and C-simplicity of a group in terms of Dixmier-type
properties of the group C-algebra.
The lemma below is well-known, see for example [10, Lemma 2.1(c)]. We
include a proof for completeness.
Lemma 4.1 Let x; y 2 C
.G/ be ﬁnite positive linear combinations of elements
from f.t/ j t 2 Gg. Then kx C yk  kxk.
Proof Let `2.G/C denote the “positive cone” consisting of all vectors  2 `2.G/
for which h; eti  0, for all t 2 G. Here .et/t2G denotes the standard orthonormal
basis of `2.G/. It is clear that h; 
i  0, for all ; 
 2 `2.G/C. Moreover, each
element z 2 C
.G/ which is a ﬁnite positive linear combination of elements from
f.t/ j t 2 Gg maps `2.G/C into `2.G/C, and satisﬁes jhz; 
ij  hzjj; j
ji, from
which it follows that
kzk D supfhz;

The conclusion follows now easily.

The ﬁrst inequality holds by Lemma 4.1, and the second by the triangle inequality.
Together, the two inequalities show that (i) and (ii) are equivalent.
The fact that (ii) implies (iii) follows from a standard application of the Hahn–
Banach separation theorem on the real vector space of self-adjoint elements in
C
.G/, while it is clear that (iii) implies (i).
ut
The theorem below sharpens the ﬁrst part of Theorem 3.3.
Theorem 4.3 Let G be a group and let t 2 G. Then t … Rad.G/ if and only if
0 2 convf.sts1/ j s 2 Gg:
()
Proof If () holds, then ..t// D 0, for every tracial state  on C
.G/, whence
t … Rad.G/ by Theorem 3.3.
For the converse implication, suppose that () does not hold, and assume to reach
a contradiction that t … Rad.G/. By Theorem 2.1 (Furman), there is a boundary
action G Õ X and some x 2 X such that t:x ¤ x.
By Lemma 4.2, there exist a self-adjoint linear functional ! on C
.G/ of norm 1
and a constant c > 0 such that Re !..sts1//  c, for all s 2 G. Let ! D !C  !
be the Jordan decomposition of !, where !C and ! are positive linear functionals
with k!k D k!Ck C k!k. Observe that !C C ! is a state, because k!k D 1.
Further, extend !˙ to positive linear functionals  ˙ on C.X/Ìr G with k ˙k D
k!˙k. Then  C C   is a state on C.X/ Ìr G which extends the state !C C !,
and, moreover,  C    is a self-adjoint linear functional which extends !.
Let  be the restriction of  C C   to C.X/. As in the proof of Lemma 3.2,
since G Õ X is a boundary action, there is a net .si/ in G such that si: converges
to the point-mass ıx in the weak-topology. Upon possibly passing to a subnet, we
can assume that si: ˙ converge in the weak-topology to positive functionals '˙
on C.X/ Ìr G (necessarily with the same norms as  ˙). The restriction of 'C C '
to C.X/ is equal to ıx, which is a pure state on C.X/, so the restriction of '˙ to C.X/
must be equal to k'˙kıx. We can now use Lemma 3.1 (applied to suitable multiples

which contradicts the fact that Re !..sts1//  c > 0, for all s 2 G.

It is well-known that groups with trivial amenable radical are ICC. This fact also
follows from Theorem 4.3, since () can only hold for elements t 2 G belonging to
an inﬁnite conjugacy class.
From Theorems 4.3 and 3.3 we obtain the following:
Corollary 4.4 Let G be a group. Then C
.G/ has a unique tracial state if and only
if
0 2 convf.sts1/ j s 2 Gg;

Using Theorem 2.2 (Breuillard–Kalantar–Kennedy–Ozawa),we can characterize
C-simple groups as follows:
Theorem 4.5 Let G be a group and let 0 denote the canonical tracial state on
C

assume that si: converges to some state  0 on C.X/ Ì G. Note that si:' converges
to the restriction of  0 to C

The restriction of  0 to C.X/ is ıx, so by Lemma 3.1, together with the fact that
the action of G on X is free, we deduce that  0..t// D 0, for all t 2 G n feg. The
restriction of  0 to C

Summary
We end with a summary of existing results combined with results obtained in this
article.
Theorem 5.1 Let G be a group and let t 2 G. The following are equivalent:

The equivalence of (i) and (ii) is [5, Proposition 7] by Furman (see Theorem 2.1
above), the equivalence of (ii) and (iii) is [2, Theorem 4.1] (quoted and reproved here
as Theorem 3.3), and the equivalence between (iii) and (iv) is Theorem 4.3 above.
Theorem 5.2 Let G be a group. The following are equivalent:
(i). C
.G/ has a unique tracial state,
(ii). G admits a faithful boundary action,

By universality of the Furstenberg boundary, it follows from Furman’s result (cf.
the equivalence of (i) and (ii) in Theorem 5.1 above) that G acts faithfully on its
Furstenberg boundary if and only if the amenable radical is trivial. Hence (ii) and
(iii) are equivalent.
The equivalence between (i) and (iii) is [2, Corollary 4.2] (quoted and reproved
here as Theorem 3.3), while the equivalence between (iii) and (iv) is Corollary 4.4
above.
Theorem 5.3 Let G be a group, and let 0 be the canonical tracial state on C

The equivalence of (i) and (ii) is stated as Theorem 2.2 above, and was proven by
Breuillard–Kalantar–Kennedy–Ozawa.The remaining implications are contained in
Theorem 4.5 (and its proof) above.
It is worth noting that in (vi) one can even take the unitaries u in C
.G/ to be in
the set f.t/ j t 2 Gg. It was shown in [6] that the Dixmier property holds for any
unital simple C-algebra with at most one tracial state. Conversely, any unital C-
algebra satisfying the Dixmier property can have at most one tracial state; moreover,
it is simple if, in addition, it has a faithful trace.
It was shown in [2] as a corollary to the characterization of groups with the unique
trace property therein, that simplicity of C
.G/ implies that C
.G/ has unique
tracial state. This implication also follows in several different ways from the results
obtained in this article. For instance, since s: D  for any tracial state  on C
.G/
and every s 2 G, the (equivalent) statements (iii) and (iv) in Theorem 5.3 both imply
uniqueness of the trace. Respectively, the fact that Theorem 5.3 (v) clearly implies
Theorem 5.2 (iv), yields yet another proof.
Finally, note that the equivalent conditions in Theorem 5.3 are strictly stronger
than those in Theorem 5.1, due to the very recent results of Le Boudec, [1], showing
that C-simplicity is not equivalent to the unique trace property.

Equilibrium States on Graph Algebras
Astrid an Huef and Iain Raeburn
Abstract We consider operator-algebraic dynamical systems given by actions of
the real line on unital C-algebras, and especially the equilibrium states (or KMS
states) of such systems. We are particularly interested in systems built from the
gauge action on the Toeplitz algebra and graph algebra of a ﬁnite directed graph,
and we describe a complete classiﬁcation of the KMS states obtained in joint work
with Laca and Sims. We then discuss applications of these results to Cuntz-Pimsner
algebras associated to local homeomorphisms, obtained in collaboration with Afsar.
Thomsen has given bounds on the range of inverse temperatures at which KMS
states may exist. We show that Thomsen’s bounds are sharp.

Introduction
There has recently been a renewal of interest in the equilibrium states (the KMS
states) of operator-algebraic dynamical systems consisting of an action of the real
line (the dynamics) on a C-algebra. There has been particular interest in systems
involving graph algebras and their Toeplitz extensions [3, 7, 11, 18].
Very satisfactory results have been obtained for systems associated to ﬁnite
directed graphs, and we now have concrete descriptions of the simplices of KMSˇ
states on the Toeplitz algebras at all inverse temperatures ˇ [9, 10]. Here we review
these results, and discuss some surprising applications to work of Thomsen on
systems involving the Cuntz-Pimsner algebras of local homeomeorphisms [17].
One main conclusion of our recent work with Afsar [1] is that lower and upper
bounds for the possible inverse temperatures given by Thomsen are sharp. For these
applications we do not need the full strength of the general results in [10], and in
this article we describe a more direct approach.

so m D .mv/ WD .. pv// 2 Œ0; 1/E0 satisﬁes Am  eˇm; we say that m is a
subinvariant vector for A.
If  factors through a KMSˇ state of C.E/, then we have equality through-
out (3.1) and (3.2), and m satisﬁes Am D eˇm. If E is strongly connected, A is
irreducible and eˇ has to be the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of A. The Perron-
Frobenius theorem then says many things: thus in particular we know that the
eigenvalue is the spectral radius .A/, that the eigenspace is one-dimensional, and
that there is an eigenvector with positive entries (see [4, Theorem 2.6] or [16,
Theorem 1.6]). Since  is a state, we have

The formula in Lemma 3.1 says that .ss

so the vector m completely determines the state . Thus we recover the following
elegant result of Enomoto, Fujii and Watatani [5]:
Theorem 3.2 Suppose that E is a strongly connected graph with vertex matrix A.
Then .C.E/; ˛/ has at most one KMS state. This state has inverse temperature
ln .A/, where .A/ is the spectral radius of A.
They proved existence of the KMSln .A/ state too, but we’ll get to that.
For states on T C.E/, the vector m only satisﬁes the subinvariance relation
Am  eˇm, but when A is irreducible Perron-Frobenius theory has things to say
about this too. For example:
•
If Am  eˇm and ˇ D ln .A/, then Am D eˇm, so that m is the Perron-
Frobenius eigenvector.
•
Suppose that Am  eˇm. Then Am 6D eˇm ” ˇ > ln .A/.
This suggests that we look more carefully at ˇ larger than the critical inverse
temperature ˇc WD ln .A/.
So we consider ˇ > ln .A/. We ﬁnd it interesting that, although we were
motivated to do so by the Perron-Frobenius theory, which applies only when E
is strongly connected, the following analysis does not require any connectivity

as before. Then  WD .1  eˇA/m has nonnegative entries,
not all 0. Since eˇ > .A/, eˇ is not in the spectrum of A, and 1eˇA is invertible.
Thus we can recover m as .1  eˇA/1. Our main point is that we can describe
geometrically the set of  2 Œ0; 1E0 which arise from unit vectors m in `1.E0/. For

Then the main theorem of [9] says:

The map  7!  is an isomorphism of ˇ D f W   yˇ D 1g onto the simplex of
KMSˇ states of .T C.E/; ˛/.
We proved existence of the KMS state  in [9, Theorem 3.1(b)] by a spatial
argument using the ﬁnite-path representation T of T C.E/ on `2.E/. Then
surjectivity of  7!  amounts to our earlier observation that the subinvariant vector
m D

. pv/

v2E0 determines a KMS state .
The set ˇ D f W   yˇ D 1g parametrising the KMSˇ states is a simplex
in the positive cone Œ0; 1/E0 of RE0 with extreme points on the coordinate axes,
and the vector yˇ is normal to this simplex. As ˇ decreases to the critical value
ˇc D ln .A/, the terms in the series on the right-hand side of (3.3) get larger, and
the simplex contracts towards the origin.
The preceding analysis does not apply when ˇ D ˇc D ln .A/ is critical,
because then the matrix 1  eˇA need not be invertible. However, we can take
a sequence ˇn decreasing to ln .A/, and use weak* compactness of the state space
to get a KMSln .A/ state of T C.E/ [9, Proposition 4.1]. When E is strongly
connected, this is the only KMSln .A/ state, and we can deduce from Perron-
Frobenius that it factors through the graph algebra C.E/. In particular, we recover
the existence of the KMSln .A/ state, ﬁrst established by other methods in [5].

176
A. an Huef and I. Raeburn
We can sum up our discussion as follows:
Corollary 3.4 Suppose that E is a directed graph with vertex matrix A, and that
ˇ 2 .0; 1/ satisﬁes ˇ  ln .A/. Then the map  7! m WD

. pv/

is a bijection
of the set of KMSˇ states of .T C.E/; ˛/ onto the unit vectors m in Œ0; 1/E0 
`1.E0/ satisfying the subinvariance relation Am  eˇm.
For ˇ > ln .A/, Theorem 3.3 is stronger, because it describes the solutions of
the subinvariance relation. But for some applications, such as those in Sect. 4, we
can deal directly with the subinvariance relation in an ad hoc manner.
4
Dumbbell Graphs
We say that a graph E is reducible if it is not strongly connected, or equivalently if
its vertex matrix A is not irreducible. For v; w 2 E0, we write v  w to mean that
vEw WD f 2 E W r./ D v and s./ D wg
is nonempty (or in other words, that there is a path from w to v). Then we deﬁne a
relation  on E0 by
v  w ” v  w and w  v:
This is an equivalence relation (it is reﬂexive because v 2 vEv), and we write
E0= for the set of equivalence classes.
For each C 2 E0=, we deﬁne AC to be the C C matrix obtained by deleting all
rows and columns involving vertices not in C. We can view AC as the vertex matrix
of the subgraph EC WD .C; E1 \r1.C/\s1.C/; r; s/. Each AC is either a 11 zero
matrix (if C is a singleton set fvg and there is no loop at v) or an irreducible matrix
(in which case we call EC a strongly connected component of E). It is possible to
order the set E0 so that the vertex matrix A is block upper-triangular with diagonal
blocks AC (see [10, §2.3]), and it follows that .A/ D maxC .AC/.
Now we consider the KMS states on T C.E/ when E is reducible. There are
three situations that we have to deal with:
•
For ˇ > ln .A/, Theorem 3.3 applies, and we have a .jE0j  1/-dimensional
simplex of KMSˇ states on T C.E/.
•
For ˇ D ln .A/, we focus on the critical components C 2 E0=  that have
.AC/ D .A/. The relation  descends to a well-deﬁned relation on the set of
critical components, and then a critical component C is minimal if D critical and
D  C imply D D C. The behaviour of the KMSln .A/ states of T C.E/ depends
on the location of the minimal critical components.

Equilibrium States on Graph Algebras
177
•
Recall that a subset H of E0 is hereditary if v 2 H and v  w imply w 2 H, and
that the Toeplitz algebra T C.EnH/ of the graph
EnH WD .E0nH; E1 \ s1.E0nH/; r; s/
is a quotient of T C.E/ [10, Proposition 2.1]. For ˇ < ln .A/, we consider the
hereditary subset H of E0 generated by the critical components (which is also
generated by the minimal critical components). If H is not all of E0, then we can
apply Theorem 3.3 to EnH and get KMSˇ states of T C.E/ for ln .AEnH/ <
ˇ < ln .A/ which factor through the quotient map onto T C.EnH/.
The ﬁrst and third situations both require straightforward applications of The-
orem 3.3, and the interesting things happen when ˇ D ln .A/ is critical. Then
the phrase “depends on the location of the minimal critical components” needs
clariﬁcation. We illustrate its meaning with some examples, which fortunately are
enough for the main applications in [1]. The key feature of these examples is that
the strongly connected components have just one vertex each. We call such graphs
dumbbell graphs.
Example 4.1 We consider the following graph E:
for which .A/ D 3. In this example, the hereditary closure of the critical component
fwg is all of E0, and hence the third situation does not arise.
If we list E0 D fw; vg, then A D
 3 1


. For ˇ D ln .A/ D ln 3 we have eˇ D 3,
and the subinvariance relation Am  eˇm says

:
The only unit vector in Œ0; 1/E0  `1.E0/ which satisﬁes this relation is m D .1; 0/.
Thus Corollary 3.4 says there is a unique KMSln 3 state on T C.E/. This state
factors through C.E/.
Example 4.2 Next we switch the horizontal arrow, so E is

 2 1


, and subinvariance for ˇ D ln 3 reduces to mv  mw.
This graph also has just one critical component fwg, but this time fwg is hereditary,
and the graph EnH has vertex set fvg, so the third situation kicks in.
We ﬁnd:
•
For ˇ > ln 3, we have a one-dimensional simplex of KMSˇ states on T C.E/,
none of which factor through C.E/.
•
The simplex of KMSln 3 states on T C.E/ has extreme points v (mv D mw D 1
2)
and w (mv D 0); only w factors through a state of C.E/.
•
For ln 2  ˇ < ln 3, there is a unique KMSˇ state v on T C.E/ which factors
through the quotient map corresponding to the hereditary set fwg  E0.
•
For ˇ D ln 2, the state v factors through C.E/.
•
For ˇ < ln 2, there are no KMSˇ states on T C.E/.
When a minimal strongly connected component EC has more than one vertex, we
organise the block form for A in three pieces: we take the hereditary closure H of
the critical components, and decompose E0 D .E0nH/ [ C [ .HnC/. The Perron-
Frobenius eigenvector for AC gives a KMSln .A/ state  C that has . pv/ D 0 for
v 2 HnC, but has . pv/ 6D 0 for vertices v such that vEC 6D ;: the precise
formula is given in [10, Theorem 4.3(a)]. Since .AEnH/ < .A/, we can also use
Theorem 3.3 to ﬁnd KMSln .A/ states on T C.EnH/, and lift them to KMSln .A/
states of T C.E/. Again the formulas and the complete classiﬁcation are given in
[10, Theorem 4.3].
To construct KMS states on the usual graph algebra C.E/, we need to know
which states on T C.E/ factor through C.E/. Here we hit another subtlety:
distinct hereditary sets give distinct ideals in T C.E/ but not necessarily in C.E/,
where the ideal in C.E/ associated to a hereditary subset H of E0 depends only
on the saturation of H. This problem is solved in [10, Theorem 5.3], which gives a
recipe for ﬁnding all the KMSˇ states of T C.E/ and C.E/ for ﬁxed ˇ.

C-Algebras from Local Homeomorphisms
We consider a compact Hausdorff space Z and a surjective local homeomorphism
h W Z ! Z. In our main examples in the next section, Z will be the inﬁnite-path
space E1 of a ﬁnite directed graph with the topology inherited from the product
space .E1/1, and h will be the backward shift  deﬁned by
.e1e2e3    / D e2e3    :
If E has no sources, then  is a homeomorphism on each cylinder set Z./, and
hence is a local homeomorphism; if E has no sinks, then  is also surjective. So
we shall suppose in the rest of this paper that E is a ﬁnite graph with no sinks or
sources, and then  W E1 ! E1 is a good example to bear in mind for this section.

We can view C.Z/ as a Hilbert bimodule X over the C-algebra C.Z/, by setting
.a  x  b/.z/ D a.z/x.z/b.h.z// and
hx; yi.z/ D
X
h.w/Dz
x.w/y.w/
for x; y 2 X.
This Hilbert bimodule has both a Toeplitz algebra T .X/ and a Cuntz-Pimsner alge-
bra O.X/: the Toeplitz algebra is generated by a representation . ; / characterised
by  .a  x  b/ D .a/ .x/.b/ and .hx; yi/ D  .x/ .y/, and the Cuntz-
Pimsner algebra [14] is a quotient of T .X/. For our purposes, all the necessary
background material is in Chapter 8 of [15]. The Cuntz-Pimsner algebra O.X/
is an example of Katsura’s topological-graph algebras: in the conventions of [15,
Chapter 9] (which are a little different from those in Katsura’s original paper [12]),
the graph is .Z; Z; id; h/.
The Toeplitz algebra T .X/ carries a gauge action  of the circle characterised by
z. .x// D z .x/ and z..a// D .a/, and this lifts to a dynamics ˛ W t 7! eit.
The kernel of the quotient map onto O.X/ is invariant under , and hence we also
get a dynamics on O.X/ (still denoted by ˛).
Thomsen [17] has studied the KMS states of the quotient system .O.X/; ˛/ (and
he worked with much more general systems .Z; h/ ). He showed that the possible
inverse temperatures of the KMS states all lie in a ﬁnite interval Œˇl; ˇc, and gave
formulas for upper and lower bounds:
ˇc D lim sup
n!1
	
n1 ln
	
max
z2Z jhn.z/j


; and
ˇl D lim sup
n!1
	
n1 ln
	
min
z2Z jhn.z/j


(applying [17, Theorem 6.8] with the function F  1; see [1, Remark 6.3] for
the connections with Thomsen’s notation). We are not aware that Thomsen has
discussed the extent to which these bounds might be sharp.
In our recent work with Afsar [1], we have studied the KMS states of the
Toeplitz system .T .X/; ˛/. We viewed C.Z/ as a continuous analogue of the (ﬁnite-
dimensional) space C.E0/, and followed the strategy of [9]. We found that, for
inverse temperatures ˇ larger than Thomsen’s ˇc, the KMSˇ states are parametrised
by a simplex ˙ˇ of ﬁnite measures  on Z satisfying a normalisation condition of
the form
Z
fˇ d D 1;
where fˇ is a ﬁxed continuous function deﬁned by summing a series like that
deﬁning yˇ in (3.3) [1, Theorem 5.1]. At ˇc, there is a phase transition: we can
see by passing to limits as ˇ decreases to ˇcC that there exist KMSˇc states on
T .X/, and can argue by mimicking our earlier results in [9] that at least one of

180
A. an Huef and I. Raeburn
them factors through O.X/. (This is Theorem 6.1 in [1].) So, in our generality at
least, Thomsen’s upper bound is sharp.
If E is a ﬁnite graph, then there is a natural Hilbert bimodule X.E/ over the
commutative C-algebra C.E0/, and the Toeplitz algebra T .X.E// was the original
model of the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger algebra T C.E/ (see [8] and [15, Chapter 8]).
This bimodule is not given by a local homeomorphism, so it does not quite ﬁt the
set-up of the present section, but the analysis of [1] was inspired by analogy with
that of [9]. As we mentioned earlier, we can also directly apply the results of [1] to
the shift  on the compact path space E1, and this gives another connection to the
results of [9] and [10].
6
Shifts on Path Spaces
We consider again a ﬁnite directed graph E with no sinks or sources, and the
inﬁnite-path space E1. Then E1 is a compact Hausdorff space and the backward
shift  W E1 ! E1 is a surjective local homeomorphism. So as in Sect. 5, we
can consider the Hilbert bimodule over the commutative C-algebra C.E1/ with
underlying space X D C.E1/. At this point we choose to write X.E1/ for X
to emphasise that this is not the graph bimodule X.E/ studied in [8] and [15,
Chapter 8].
The topology on E1 arises from viewing it as a subset of the inﬁnite product
.E1/1 of the ﬁnite set E1, and the cylinder sets
Z./ D fx 2 E1 W xi D i for i  jjg
associated to ﬁnite paths  2 E form a basis of compact-open sets for the topology
on E1. Then a straightforward calculation shows:
Lemma 6.1 The elements Pv WD .Z.v// and Se WD  .Z.e// of T .X.E1// form
a Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger E-family.
The universal property of the Toeplitz algebra T C.E/ now gives a homo-
morphism P;S W T C.E/ ! T .X.E1//. Corollary 4.2 of [8] implies that this
homomorphism is injective, and it is equivariant for the gauge actions, and hence
for the various dynamics ˛ studied in Sects. 3 and 5. So composing with P;S takes
KMSˇ states of .T .X.E1//; ˛/ to KMSˇ states of .T C.E/; ˛/. Now we have
KMSˇ states of T .X.E1// for ˇ larger than Thomsen’s ˇc, and KMSˇ states of
T C.E/ for ˇ > ln .A/, where A is the vertex matrix of E. We reconcile this
in the following reassuring lemma, which is Proposition 7.3 of [1]. (Note that the
condition on E is there to ensure that .A/ > 0, so that ln .A/ makes sense.)

Lemma 6.2 Suppose that E is a directed graph with at least one cycle. Then
1
n ln

! ln .A/
as n ! 1.
Thus Thomsen’s ˇc is our ln .A/, and the range of possible ˇ in Theorem 3.3 is
the same as that in [1, Theorem 5.1]. Suppose that ˇ > ln .A/, that  is a measure
on E1 satisfying the hypothesis R fˇ d D 1 of [1, Theorem 5.1], and that  is the
corresponding state of T .X.E1//. Then Proposition 7.4 of [1] says that  ı P;S
is the state  of [9, Theorem 2.1] associated to the vector  D ./ D

.Z.v//

in Œ0; 1/E0.
Every state  of .T C.E/; ˛/ has the form  ı P;S for some measure  on
E satisfying
R
fˇ d D 1 [1, Corollary 7.6]. In the proof of this result, such a
measure  is constructed as a measure on the inverse limit E1 D lim
 n En, and an
examination of the construction shows that there is considerable leeway in building
such a measure. Indeed, for each  satisfying the normalisation relation yˇ   D 1
of [9],
n

Z
fˇ d D 1 and .Z.// D v for v 2 E0o
is a simplex of codimension jE0j C 1 in the cone M.E1/C of positive measures.
Thus there are many more KMSˇ states on T .X.E1// than on T C.E/.
The injection P;S W T C.E/ ! T .X.E1// is certainly not surjective—if
for no other reason, because T .X.E1// has many more KMS states. However,
Proposition 7.1 of [1] says that P;S induces an isomorphism of the Cuntz-Krieger
algebra C.E/ onto O.X.E1//! (This observation is essentially due to Exel [6] and
Brownlowe [2].) Since this isomorphism also intertwines the dynamics of [9] and
that of [1], the latter algebra has effectively the same KMS states as C.E/.
We now return to the dumbbell graph E
which we discussed in Example 4.2 of Sect. 4. The system .C.E/; ˛/ has KMSˇ
states for ˇ D ln 3 D ln .A/ and ˇ D ln 2 D ln .Afvg/. Thus so does O.X.E1//.
We have already seen in Lemma 6.2 that ˇc D ln .A/ in general. For this E and
x 2 E1, we can compute
jn.x/j D jEnr.x/j D

Thus minx jn.x/j D 2n is attained when r.x/ D v, and Thomsen’s ˇl is ln 2. So for
the local homeomorphism  W E1 ! E1, the lower bound ˇl in [17, Theorem 6.8]
is also sharp.
It is easy to see with dumbbell graphs that there can be KMSˇ states at inverse
temperatures strictly between ˇl and ˇc. For example, with E the following graph
both C.E/ and O.X.E1// have KMS states at inverse temperatures ln 2, ln 3 and
ln 4.
There are, however, interesting constraints on the possible inverse tempera-
tures ˇ. First, since eˇ has to be the spectral radius of an irreducible integer matrix,
it has to be an algebraic number. But there are also other, more subtle constraints.
The issue is discussed, along with relevant results of Lind [13], in [10, §7.1].

Abstract This is a survey article about recent developments in semigroup C*-
algebras. These C*-algebras generated by left regular representations of semigroups
have been studied for some time, but it was only recently that several new
connections and results were discovered, triggered by particularly interesting
examples from number theory and group theory. We explain the construction of
semigroup C*-algebras, introduce the basic underlying algebraic objects, deﬁne
two important conditions called Toeplitz condition and independence, and present
results concerning amenability and nuclearity, K-theory, and classiﬁcation.

Introduction
The study of C*-algebras attached to semigroups was initiated by Coburn, who
studied the C*-algebra of the natural numbers in [3, 4]. Motivated by index
theory and related K-theoretic questions, this line of research was continued in
[5, 6, 14, 15]. Later on, Murphy introduced and studied C*-algebras of more general
semigroups, for instance positive cones in ordered abelian groups [35], and then
also general left cancellative semigroups [36–38]. Nica studied another class of
semigroup which he called positive cones in quasi-lattice ordered groups in [39].
Nica’s work was taken up in [7, 8, 24].
Recently, the author tried to develop a framework which would unify all these
previous studies, and used that framework to explain the connection between
amenability and nuclearity in the context of semigroups and their C*-algebras (see
Sect. 5, and also [25, 26]). The analysis that was necessary led to two conditions
called the Toeplitz condition and the independence condition (see Sects. 3 and 4).
As it turned out later, these two conditions also play a crucial role if we want
to compute K-theory for semigroup C*-algebras (see Sect. 6, and also [10, 11]).
Finally, putting together many of our results, we obtain classiﬁcation results for

C*-algebras attached to particular classes of semigroups (see Sect. 7, and also
[17, 27, 29]).
The author’s motivation to study semigroup C*-algebras did not only come from
the previous work mentioned at the beginning, but also from new examples of
number theoretic origin (see [9, 16, 27]). Given the importance of examples, we
have included a list of examples in Sect. 2.2, and we come back to that list at various
points later on in order to illustrate our results.
Topics not covered in this survey article include C*-algebras of Zappa-Szép
products of semigroups [1], C*-algebras of certain topological semigroups [46, 50],
or boundary quotients of semigroup C*-algebras as in [8, 49].
As this is a survey article, we have not included any proofs. Instead, we point the
reader to the relevant literature. To this end, we have included an exhaustive (but not
complete) list of references.

Semigroup C*-Algebras
We introduce C*-algebras attached to semigroups. The main objects of study are
reduced semigroup C*-algebras, which are generated by left regular representations
of left cancellative semigroups. Full semigroup C*-algebras are deﬁned using left
inverse hulls. We include a list of examples in order to illustrate our constructions
and results.
2.1
C*-Algebras Generated by Left Regular Representations
Let P be a left cancellative semigroup. P acts on itself by left multiplication, i.e.,
every p 2 P induces a map P ! P; x 7! px (we denote this map by p again). This
gives rise to the left regular representation of P. To deﬁne it, consider the Hilbert
space `2P. It comes with a canonical orthonormal basis fıx W
x 2 Pg given by
ıx.y/ D ıx;y. For every p 2 P, deﬁne an isometry Vp by setting Vpıx D ıpx. Here,
our assumption that our semigroup P is left cancellative ensures that the assignment
ıx 7! ıpx indeed extends to an isometry. The left reduced semigroup C*-algebra of
P is given as follows:
Deﬁnition 2.1 C
.P/ WD C 
fVp W p 2 Pg


 L .`2P/.
In a completely analogous way, we deﬁne the right reduced semigroup C*-algebra
C
 .P/ of a right cancellative semigroup P as the C*-algebra generated by the right
regular representation. Although we do not focus our discussion on this aspect, it
turns out to be very interesting and intriguing to compare C
.P/ with C
 .P/ (for a
cancellative semigroup P). We refer the interested reader to [11, 29, 34].

Semigroup C-Algebras

2.2
Examples
The ﬁrst example is the additive semigroup N of natural numbers (including zero). In
that case, C
.N/ is the Toeplitz algebra, the C*-algebra generated by the unilateral
shift. It was studied by Coburn in [3, 4].
Here is one way to generalize our ﬁrst example: Let G be a totally ordered abelian
group. Denoting the order by , we can deﬁne the positive cone in G, P WD fx 2 G W
x  0g. For instance, take an additive subgroup G of .R; C/, view it as an ordered
group with respect to the canonical total order on R, and set P WD G \ Œ0; 1/.
Semigroup C*-algebras attached to such positive cones were studied in [5, 6, 14,
15, 28]. The original motivation came from index theory and K-theory.
Another way to generalize our ﬁrst example is to look at semigroups like NN or
N  N (see for instance [38] or [39]). The ﬁrst one may be viewed as the semigroup
(with identity) generated by two elements a and b subject to the relation ab D ba,
while the second one is the semigroup generated by two elements without imposing
any relations. From this point of view, these examples may be viewed as semigroups
given by generators ˙ and relations R, i.e., semigroups of the form P D h˙jRiC.
Of course, every semigroup may be written in that way. The point is to ﬁnd classes
of generators and relations which lead to well-behaved examples of semigroups. Let
us mention the following particular cases:
Artin monoids are given by generators
˙ D fi W i 2 Ig;
where I is some (countable) index set, and relations
ij : : :
„ ƒ‚ …
mij
D ji : : :
„ ƒ‚ …
mji
for some mij D mji 2 f2; 3; : : : ; 1g, for i ¤ j in I. Here mij D mji D 1 means that
we do not impose a relation of the form ij : : : D ji : : : for that particular pair
i; j.
A particular class of examples is given by right-angled Artin monoids, where we
require mij 2 f2; 1g for every i ¤ j in I. In other words, either a pair of generators
commutes, or we do not impose any relation. The relations can be conveniently
encoded in a graph by letting ˙ be the set of vertices and connecting two vertices
by an edge if the corresponding generators commute. Given an unoriented graph
 such that every pair of vertices is joined by at most one edge, we write AC
 for
the corresponding right-angled Artin monoid. The C*-algebras of such right-angled
Artin monoids were studied in [7, 8, 17, 22].

188
X. Li
Another class is given by Artin monoids of ﬁnite type. Here we require that if we
add the relations 2 D e for all  2 ˙ to the deﬁning relations
ij : : :
„ ƒ‚ …
mij
D ji : : :
„ ƒ‚ …
mji
;
then the group generated by ˙ subject to these two families of relations should
become ﬁnite. Particular examples are given by braid monoids, for instance
BC
2 D h1; 2j121 D 212iC :
Another family of examples are Baumslag-Solitar monoids, which are generated
by ˙ D fa; bg subject to the relation abk D bla for some k; l 2 N. The semigroup
C*-algebras of Baumslag-Solitar monoids were studied in [47] (see also [48]).
There is also the Thompson monoids, for which the generators are ˙
D
fx0; x1; : : :g and the relations are given by xnxk D xkxnC1 for k < n.
All these examples of semigroups given by generators and relations embed
canonically into the corresponding groups deﬁned by the same presentation. In
the study of these semigroups given by generators and relations, purely algebraic
considerations in the spirit of [13] or [33, §6] turn out to be very useful.
We could also consider ﬁnitely generated, abelian semigroups. Given such a
semigroup P, the complex semigroup ring CŒP is the coordinate ring of a toric
variety. A particular class of examples are given by numerical semigroups. These
are of the form P D N n F, where F is a ﬁnite set such that P is still additively
closed. For instance, we could take F D f1g.
As a last class of examples, we introduce ax C b-semigroups over integral
domains. Given an integral domain R, let P D R Ì R be the semidirect product
of the additive group R by the multiplicative semigroup R with respect to the
canonical action by multiplication. A particular case is when R is the ring of
algebraic integers in a number ﬁeld. The corresponding semigroup C*-algebras
were studied in [9, 16, 27, 29, 30].
2.3
The Left Inverse Hull, and Full Semigroup C*-Algebras
Let S be an inverse semigroup with zero 0, and set S D S n f0g. The reduced
C*-algebra C
.S/ attached to S is deﬁned as follows: For s 2 S, deﬁne the partial
isometry
s W `2S ! `2S; ıx 7!
(

Semigroup C-Algebras

The reduced C*-algebra C
.S/ of S is the sub-C*-algebra of L .`2S/ generated by
fs W s 2 Sg. The reader may ﬁnd more information about inverse semigroups and
their C*-algebras in [19–21, 40, 42].
Now assume that P is a left cancellative semigroup. We construct the left inverse
hull of P as follows: Let S be the inverse semigroup of partial bijections of P
generated by p W P
Š
! P; x 7! px (p 2 P). The semilattice of idempotents E
of S is given by the set of constructible ideals
J D fp1
1 q1 : : : p1
n qnP W pi; qi 2 Pg [ f;g:
As explained in [40, Corollary 3.2.13], the isometry `2P ! `2S; ıp 7! ıp
induces a surjective homomorphism C
.S/  C
.P/.
To deﬁne the full semigroup C*-algebra of P, we set C.P/ WD C.S/. By
deﬁnition, C.S/ is the C*-algebra which is universal for representations of our
inverse semigroup S by partial isometries, with the extra requirement that 0 2 S
is representated by 0 in the target C*-algebra. Our deﬁnition of full semigroup
C*-algebras differs from the deﬁnitions in [25, 40], where two versions of full semi-
group C*-algebras (denoted by C.P/ and C
s .P/) were introduced. In particular
cases, however, it is possible to identify our full semigroup C*-algebra with the one
from [25, 40] (compare [40, Proposition 3.3.1 and Proposition 3.3.2]). Furthermore,
we let  W C.P/  C
.P/ be the composite C.P/ D C.S/  C
.S/  C
.P/.
3
The Toeplitz Condition
From now on, let us assume that P is a subsemigroup of a group G such that P
contains the identity e. Let D.P/ WD C
.P/ \ `1.P/, where we view `1.P/ as
multiplication operators on `2P. As P is a subsemigroup of G, it turns out that
we always have a partial crossed product description for C
.P/, i.e., there exists a
canonically given partial action G Õ D.P/ such that C
.P/ Š D.P/Ìpartial
r
G. This
is already helpful. For instance, if we let ˝P be the spectrum of D.P/, and if GË˝P
is the partial transformation groupoid attached to (the dual action corresponding to)
G Õ D.P/, then we get C
.P/ Š C
r .G Ë ˝P/, a description of our semigroup
C*-algebra as a groupoid C*-algebra.
The Toeplitz condition will allow us to write C
.P/ as a crossed product attached
to a global action, at least up to Morita equivalence.
Recall that S is the left inverse hull of P.
Deﬁnition 3.1 We say that P 
 G is Toeplitz if for every g 2 G, the partial bijection
P \ .g1P/ ! .gP/ \ P; x 7! gx is in S.
Let us now give an operator algebraic reformulation of the Toeplitz condition,
which will immediately lead us to the desired crossed product description. Starting
with our embedding P 
 G, we view `2P as a subspace of `2G. Let EP 2 L .`2G/

190
X. Li
be the orthogonal projection onto `2P. Moreover, as `2P is a subspace of `2G, we
may view C
.P/ as a sub-C*-algebra of L .`2G/. Furthermore, let  be the left
regular representation of G. Then we have Vp D EPpEP for every p 2 P. Clearly,
if we think of `1.G/ as multiplication operators on `2G, then EP corresponds to
1P 2 `1.G/. In addition, we have a canonical action G Õ `1.G/. Now let DPG
be the smallest G-invariant sub-C*-algebra of `1.G/ containing EP. Because we
have Vp D EPpEP for every p 2 P, we obtain
C
.P/ 
 EP.DPG Ìr G/EP:
Moreover, EP is a full projection in DPG Ìr G. Therefore,
EP.DPG Ìr G/EP M DPG Ìr G:
If C
.P/  EP.DPG Ìr G/EP, then we get desired crossed product description.
It turns out that P 
 G is Toeplitz if and only if for every g 2 G with EPgEP ¤
0, there exist p1; q1; : : : ; pn; qn in P such that EPgEP D V
p1Vq1    V
pnVqn.
In particular, if P 
 G is Toeplitz, then C
.P/ D EP.DPG Ìr G/EP, and the
latter C*-algebra is Morita equivalent to DPG Ìr G.
For example, if P is left Ore, then P embeds into its group of left quotients P1P,
and P 
 P1P is Toeplitz. A left Ore semigroup is deﬁned as follows: A semigroup
is called right reversible if every pair of non-empty left ideals has a non-empty
intersection. A semigroup is said to satisfy the left Ore condition if it is cancellative
and right reversible. The following result can be found in [2, Theorem 1.23] or [23,
§1.1]: A semigroup P can be embedded into a group G such that G D P1P D
fq1p W p; q 2 Pg if and only if P satisﬁes the left Ore condition. It is easy to check
that P 
 P1P is Toeplitz. For instance, this covers the case of cancellative, abelian
semigroups. It also covers the case of ax C b-semigroups over integral domains.
We mention two examples of subsemigroups of groups for which the Toeplitz
condition does not hold. Let NN be the free semigroup on two generators. We have
a canonical embedding of N  N into F2, the free group on two generators. It turns
out that if we compose that map with the canonical quotient map F2  F2=F00
2, then
we still get an embedding N  N ,! F2=F00
2. This pair, however, does not satisfy the
Toeplitz condition. Roughly speaking, the argument is as follows: Let P D N  N,
which we view as a subsemigroup in G D F2=F00
2. If P 
 G were Toeplitz, then it
would follow that for every g 2 G, we must have that either gP\P is empty or gP\P
is of the form pP for some p 2 P. However, in our particular example, it is easy to
come up with a; b; c; d 2 P with ab1cd1 2 F00
2 such that e … ba1P (in G) and
b; c 2 pP ) p D e. Then ba1P \ P ¤ P and b; c 2 ba1P \ P, so that ba1P \ P
cannot be of the form pP for some p 2 P. Another example, which can be treated
using similar ideas as our ﬁrst one, is given as follows: Consider the Thompson
group F, which is deﬁned by the same generators and relations as the Thompson
monoid. This means that F is the universal group generated by ˙ D fx0; x1; : : :g
subject to the relations xnxk D xkxnC1 for k < n. Let a and b be the canonical free

Semigroup C-Algebras
191
generators of NN. It turns out that we obtain an embedding NN ,! F by a 7! x0,
b 7! x1, and that N  N ,! F does not satisfy the Toeplitz condition.
4
The Independence Condition
As above, we assume that P is a subsemigroup of a group G, and that P contains the
identity element of G.
The independencecondition is a condition on the ideal structure of our semigroup
P. Recall that we have introduced the set of constructible ideals
J D fp1
1 q1 : : : p1
n qnP W pi; qi 2 Pg [ f;g:
Deﬁnition 4.1 J is called independent if for all X; X1; : : : ; Xn 2 J , X D Sn
iD1 Xi
implies X D Xi for some 1  i  n.
We say that P satisﬁes the independence condition if J is independent.
We would like to give equivalent characterizations of independence. To do so,
recall that S is the left inverse hull of P. Let E be the semilattice of idempotents of
S.  W C.P/  C
.P/ restricts to a canonical map C.E/  D.P/. It was shown
in [40, Theorem 3.2.14] that the following are equivalent:
•
the canonical map C
.S/  C
.P/ is injective,
•
the canonical map C.E/  D.P/ is injective,
•
J is independent.
For example, if every constructible ideal is principal, i.e., J D fpP W
p 2
Pg[f;g, then P satisﬁes the independence condition. This covers the case of positive
cones in quasi-lattice ordered groups (see [26, 39]). Moreover, ax C b-semigroups
over Dedekind domains, or more generally, Krull rings, satisfy the independence
condition (see [25, 29]).
Let us also present two (classes of) counterexamples, i.e., semigroups which
do not satisfy the independence condition. For instance, consider the numerical
semigroup Nnf1g. It turns out that it does not satisfy independence. More generally,
every numerical semigroup of the form N n F, where F is a non-empty, ﬁnite
subset of N, does not satisfy independence. Another class of examples is given as
follows: For certain integral domains which are not Krull rings, their multiplicative
semigroups or ax C b-semigroups do not satisfy independence. For example, R D
ZŒi
p
3 is such an example. For more details, we refer the reader to [29, §7].

Amenability and Nuclearity
Let P be a subsemigroup of a group G. The following result explains the connection
between amenability (of underlying dynamical systems) and nuclearity for semi-
group C*-algebras.
Theorem 5.1 Consider the following statements:
(i) C.P/ is nuclear,
(ii) C
.P/ is nuclear,
(iii) G Ë ˝P is amenable,
(iv)  W C.P/  C
.P/ is an isomorphism.
We always have (i) ) (ii) , (iii). If P satisﬁes the independence condition, then
(iii) ) (iv) and (iii) ) (i), so that (i), (ii) and (iii) are equivalent.
Here GË˝P is the partial translation groupoid from Sect. 3. A proof of this theorem
will appear in [32], but the reader may also consult [26] for a special case of that
theorem.
Moreover, it was observed in [40], and also follows immediately from the
partial crossed product description discussed in Sect. 3 together with [18] or [21,
Theorem 20.7 and Theorem 25.10] that if P is a subsemigroup of an amenable
group, then C
.P/ is nuclear.
To give a particular class of examples, it was shown in [22], and also in [26], that
semigroup C*-algebras attached to right-angled Artin monoids are nuclear.
6
K-Theory
Let P be a subsemigroup of a group G. The following result gives a formula for the
K-theory of semigroup C*-algebras.
Theorem 6.1 Assume that P satisﬁes the independence condition, and that P 
 G
is Toeplitz. If G satisﬁes the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefﬁcients, then

We refer the reader to [10, 11] for the proof of this theorem as well as further
details concerning K-theory for semigroup C*-algebras.
Let us apply our general K-theoretic formula to ax C b-semigroups over integral
domains. Let R be a countable Krull ring with group of multiplicative units R and
divisor class group C.R/. For every k 2 C.R/, let ak be a divisorial ideal which

represents k. Then

K.C.ak Ì R//:
Here ClK is the class group of K, and R is the group of invertible elements in R
(i.e., the units in R or K).
If P is the positive cone in a totally ordered group G, then it is easy to see that P
satisﬁes the independence condition, and also that P 
 G is Toeplitz. Moreover, in
that case, we have JPG D fgP W g 2 Gg [ f;g, and GP D P D feg. Therefore, if
G satisﬁes the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefﬁcients, then we get in K-theory

Classiﬁcation Results
We start with a classiﬁcation result for semigroup C*-algebras attached to right-
angled Artin monoids. We need to introduce the following terminology: A graph
 D .V; E/ is called co-reducible if there exist non-empty subsets V1 and V2 of
V with V D V1 t V2 such that V1  V2 
 E.  is called co-irreducible if 
is not co-reducible. In general, we can always decompose  into co-irreducible
components, i.e., co-irreducible subgraphs i D .Vi; Ei/. Let t. / be the number of
those co-irreducible components which are singletons. Moreover, let us deﬁne the
Euler characteristic of a graph  0 D .V0; E0/. To this end, we view  0 as a simplicial
complex by deﬁning for every n D 0; 1; 2; : : : the set of n-simplices by
Kn WD ffv0; : : : ; vng 
 V0 W .vi; vj/ 2 E0 for all i; j 2 f0; : : : ; ng; i ¤ jg:
Then we set . 0/ WD 1  P1
nD0.1/njKnj. Given a graph  and k 2 Z, let Nk. /
be the number of co-irreducible components of  with Euler characteristic equal
to k.

We remark that it is not necessary to restrict to ﬁnite graphs, and refer to [17] for
the general result and further details.
Here is another classiﬁcation result, this time for semigroup C*-algebras attached
to ax C b-semigroups over rings of algebraic integers in number ﬁelds.
Theorem 7.2 Let K and L be number ﬁelds with rings of algebraic integers R and
S. Assume that K and L have the same number of roots of unity. If C
.R Ì R/ Š
C
.S Ì S/ then K and L are arithmetically equivalent, i.e., K D L.
Assume, in addition, that K and L are Galois extensions. In that case, we have
C
.R Ì R/ Š C
.S Ì S/ if and only if K Š L.
The reader may ﬁnd the proof, and further information, in [27]. [43, 44] contain
more details about arithmetic equivalence.
If we ask for isomorphism of semigroup C*-algebras preserving the canonical
sub-C*-algebras, then we get a stronger conclusion:
Theorem 7.3 Let K and L be number ﬁelds with rings of algebraic integers R and
S. If there exists an isomorphism C
.R Ì R/ Š C
.S Ì S/ which restricts to an
isomorphism D.RÌR/ Š D.SÌS/, then K and L are arithmetically equivalent
and ClK Š ClL (as groups).
Here D denotes the sub-C*-algebra deﬁned in Sect. 3. This result is proven in [30].
Our conclusion is really stronger than the one in the previous theorem, see [12].
Such sub-C*-algebras like D are Cartan subalgebras in the C*-algebraic sense
(see [45]). They are studied in a general context in [31].
Furthermore, we mention that there are more classiﬁcation results for ax C b-
semigroups over more general integral domains in [29].
For Baumslag-Solitar monoids, Spielberg obtained classiﬁcation results in [47].

Topological Full Groups of Étale Groupoids
Hiroki Matui
Abstract This is a survey of the recent development of the study of topological full
groups of étale groupoids on the Cantor set. Étale groupoids arise from dynamical
systems, e.g. actions of countable discrete groups, equivalence relations. Minimal Z-
actions, minimal ZN-actions and one-sided shifts of ﬁnite type are basic examples.
We are interested in algebraic, geometric and analytic properties of topological
full groups. More concretely, we discuss simplicity of commutator subgroups,
abelianization, ﬁnite generation, cohomological ﬁniteness properties, amenability,
the Haagerup property, and so on. Homology groups of étale groupoids, groupoid
C-algebras and their K-groups are also investigated.

Introduction
We discuss various properties of topological full groups of topological dynamical
systems on Cantor sets. The study of full groups in the setting of topological
dynamics was initiated by Giordano, Putnam and Skau [15]. For a minimal action
' W Z Õ X on a Cantor set X, they deﬁned several types of full groups and showed
that these groups completely determine the orbit equivalence class, the strong orbit
equivalence class and the ﬂip conjugacy class of ', respectively.
The notion of topological full groups was later generalized to the setting of
essentially principal étale groupoids G on Cantor sets in [27]. Étale groupoids
(called r-discrete groupoids in [35]) provide us a natural framework for uniﬁed
treatment of various topological dynamical systems. The topological full group
ŒŒG  of G is a subgroup of Homeo.G .0// consisting of all homeomorphisms of
G .0/ whose graph is ‘contained’ in the groupoid G as a compact open subset (see
Deﬁnition 4.1). From an action ' of a discrete group  on a Cantor set X, we can
construct the étale groupoid G', which is called the transformation groupoid (see
Example 2.3). The topological full group ŒŒG' of G' is the group of ˛ 2 Homeo.X/
for which there exists a continuous map c W X !  such that ˛.x/ D 'c.x/.x/ for all

x 2 X. Many other examples of étale groupoids and topological full groups will be
provided in later sections.
One of the most fundamental result for topological full groups is the isomorphism
theorem (Theorem 5.1), which says that G1 is isomorphic to G2 if and only if
ŒŒG1 is isomorphic to ŒŒG2. In general, it is often difﬁcult to distinguish two
discrete groups. But, the étale groupoids have rich information about the topological
dynamical systems, and so the isomorphism theorem helps us to determine the
isomorphism class of the topological full groups.
The homology groups Hn.G / for n  0 are deﬁned for étale groupoids G (see
Deﬁnition 3.1). When G is a transformation groupoid G', the homology Hn.G'/
agrees with the group homology (Example 3.3 (2)). In many examples, we can
check that the homology groups ‘coincide’ with the K-groups of C
r .G /. Thus, we
have isomorphisms L
n H2nCi.G / Š Ki.C
r .G // for i D 0; 1. This phenomenon is
formulated as the HK conjecture (Conjecture 3.5).
In many cases, it is known that the commutator subgroup D.ŒŒG / of ŒŒG 
becomes simple (Theorem 6.5 (1), Theorem 7.3 (1)). So, it is natural to consider the
abelianization ŒŒG ab D ŒŒG =D.ŒŒG /. It turns out that the abelian group ŒŒG ab is
closely related to the homology groups of G . This relation is formulated as the AH
conjecture (Conjecture 4.7).
In addition to these two conjectures, we are interested in several properties of
ŒŒG . In [26], it was shown that D.ŒŒG'/ is ﬁnitely generated if ' W Z Õ X
is a minimal subshift (see Theorem 8.3 (1)). In [28], it was shown that, for any
SFT groupoid GA (see Example 2.5), ŒŒGA is of type F1 and D.ŒŒGA/ is ﬁnitely
generated (Theorem 8.8). Such ﬁniteness conditions of topological full groups are
important problems. In [20], it was shown that, for any minimal action ' W Z Õ
X, ŒŒG' is amenable (see Theorem 8.4). In [28], it was shown that ŒŒGA has
the Haagerup property for any SFT groupoid GA (Theorem 8.9). Such analytic
properties of topological full groups are also our main concern.

Preliminaries
2.1
Étale Groupoids
The cardinality of a set A is written #A and the characteristic function of A is written
1A. The ﬁnite cyclic group of order n is denoted by Zn D fNr j r D 1; 2; : : : ; ng.
We say that a subset of a topological space is clopen if it is both closed and
open. A topological space is said to be totally disconnected if its topology is
generated by clopen subsets. By a Cantor set, we mean a compact, metrizable,
totally disconnected space with no isolated points. It is known that any two such
spaces are homeomorphic. The homeomorphism group of a topological space X is
written Homeo.X/. The commutator subgroup of a group  is denoted by D. /.
We let ab denote the abelianization  =D. /.

In this article, by an étale groupoid we mean a second countable locally compact
Hausdorff groupoid such that the range map is a local homeomorphism.We refer the
reader to [35, 36] for background material on étale groupoids. Roughly speaking,
a groupoid G is a ‘group-like’ object, in which the product may not be deﬁned
for all pairs in G . An étale groupoid G is equipped with locally compact Hausdorff
topology, which is compatible with the groupoid structure, and the map g 7! gg1 is
a local homeomorphism. For an étale groupoid G , we let G .0/ denote the unit space
and let s and r denote the source and range maps, i.e. s.g/ D g1g and r.g/ D gg1.
An element g 2 G can be thought of as an arrow from s.g/ to r.g/. For x 2 G .0/,
G .x/ D r.G x/ is called the G -orbit of x. When every G -orbit is dense in G .0/, G is
said to be minimal. For a subset Y  G .0/, the reduction of G to Y is r1.Y/\s1.Y/
and denoted by G jY. If Y is clopen, then the reduction G jY is an étale subgroupoid
of G in an obvious way. For x 2 G .0/, we write Gx D r1.x/ \ s1.x/ and call it the
isotropy group of x. The isotropy bundle of G is G 0 D fg 2 G j r.g/ D s.g/g D
S
x2G .0/ Gx. We say that G is principal if G 0 D G .0/. When the interior of G 0 is G .0/,
we say that G is essentially principal.
A subset U  G is called a G -set if rjU; sjU are injective. Any open G -set U
induces the homeomorphism .rjU/ ı .sjU/1 from s.U/ to r.U/. We write .U/ D
.rjU/ ı .sjU/1. When U; V are G -sets,
U1 D fg 2 G j g1 2 Ug
and
UV D fgg0 2 G j g 2 U; g0 2 V; s.g/ D r.g0/g
are also G -sets. A probability measure  on G .0/ is said to be G -invariant if
.r.U// D .s.U// holds for every open G -set U. The set of all G -invariant
probability measures is denoted by M.G /.
For an étale groupoid G , we denote the reduced groupoid C-algebra of G by
C
r .G / and identify C0.G .0// with a subalgebra of C
r .G /. J. Renault obtained the
following theorem (see also [27, Theorem 5.1]).
Theorem 2.1 ([36, Theorem 5.9]) Two essentially principal étale groupoids G1
and G2 are isomorphic if and only if there exists an isomorphism ' W C
r .G1/ !
C

Examples
In this subsection, we present several examples of étale groupoids. Throughout this
subsection, by an étale groupoid, we mean a second countable étale groupoid whose
unit space is the Cantor set.

Example 2.2 (AF Groupoids) We would like to recall the notion of AF groupoids
([35, Deﬁnition III.1.1], [16, Deﬁnition 3.7], [27, Deﬁnition 2.2]). Let G be an étale
groupoid.
•
We say that K
 G is an elementary subgroupoid if K is a compact open
principal subgroupoid of G such that K .0/ D G .0/.
•
We say that G is an AF groupoid if it can be written as an increasing union of
elementary subgroupoids.
If K
is a compact étale principal groupoid, then K
is identiﬁed with the
equivalence relation f.r.g/; s.g// j g 2 K g on K .0/ and the topology on K agrees
with the relative topology from K .0/  K .0/. Also, the equivalence relation K is
uniformly ﬁnite, i.e. there exists n 2 N such that #r1.x/  n for any x 2 K .0/.
An AF groupoid is principal by deﬁnition. The C-algebra associated with an
AF groupoid is an AF algebra. It is known that any AF groupoids are represented
by Bratteli diagrams (see [16, Theorem 3.9]). We provide a brief explanation of it.
A directed graph B D .V; E/ is called a Bratteli diagram when V D S1
nD0 Vn and
E D S1
nD1 En are disjoint unions of ﬁnite sets of vertices and edges with maps
i W En ! Vn1 and t W En ! Vn both of which are surjective. Let
XB D
(
.en/n 2
Y
n
En j en 2 En; t.en/ D i.enC1/
8n 2 N
)
:
The set XB endowed with the relative topology is called the inﬁnite path space of B.
Deﬁne an equivalence relation (i.e. principal groupoid) Km by
Km D f..en/n; . fn/n/ 2 XB  XB j en D fn
8n  mg:
Then, Km equipped with the relative topology from XB  XB is a compact principal
étale groupoid. Clearly one has Km  KmC1. Set G D S
m Km. Endowed with the
inductive limit topology, G becomes an AF groupoid. Conversely, Theorem 3.9 of
[16] states that any AF groupoid arises in such a way.
Example 2.3 (Transformation Groupoids) Let ' W 
Õ X be an action of a
countable discrete group  on a Cantor set X by homeomorphisms. We let G' D
 X and deﬁne the following groupoid structure: .; x/ and .0; x0/ are composable
if and only if x D '0.x0/, in which case .; '0.x0//  .0; x0/ D .0; x0/, and
.; x/1 D .1; '.x//. Then G' is an étale groupoid and called the transformation
groupoid arising from ' W  Õ X. The unit space G .0/
'
is canonically identiﬁed with
X via the map .1; x/ 7! x.
The groupoid G' is principal if and only if the action ' is free, that is, ' does
not have any ﬁxed points unless  D 1. The groupoid G' is essentially principal if
and only if the action ' is topologically free, that is, fx 2 X j '.x/ D xg has no
interior points unless  D 1. The groupoid G' is minimal if and only if the action '
is minimal, that is, any orbit of ' is dense in X.

The C-algebra C
r .G'/ is canonically isomorphic to the crossed product
C-algebra C.X/ Ìr  .
Medynets, Sauer and Thom recently obtained the following interesting result.
Theorem 2.4 ([31, Theorem 3.2]) Let  and  be ﬁnitely generated groups. The
following are equivalent.
1. There exist free actions ' W  Õ X and  W  Õ Y on Cantor sets such that
G' Š G .
2.  and  are bi-Lipschitz equivalent.
Example 2.5 (SFT Groupoids) We recall the deﬁnition of étale groupoids arising
from one-sided shifts of ﬁnite type [28, Section 6.1]. Let .V; E/ be a ﬁnite directed
graph, where V is a ﬁnite set of vertices and E is a ﬁnite set of edges. For e 2 E,
i.e/ denotes the initial vertex of e and t.e/ denotes the terminal vertex of e. Let
A D .A.; 
//;
2V be the adjacency matrix of .V; E/, that is,
A.; 
/ D #fe 2 E j i.e/ D ; t.e/ D 
g:
We assume that A is irreducible (i.e. for all ; 
 2 V there exists n 2 N such that
An.; 
/ > 0) and that A is not a permutation matrix. Deﬁne
XA D f.xk/k2N 2 EN j t.xk/ D i.xkC1/
8k 2 Ng:
With the product topology, XA is a Cantor set. Deﬁne a surjective continuous map
A W XA ! XA by
A.x/k D xkC1
k 2 N; x D .xk/k 2 XA:
In other words, A is the (one-sided) shift on XA. It is easy to see that A is a local
homeomorphism. The dynamical system .XA; A/ is called the one-sided irreducible
shift of ﬁnite type (SFT) associated with the graph .V; E/ (or the matrix A).
The étale groupoid GA for .XA; A/ is given by
GA D f.x; n; y/ 2 XA  Z  XA j 9k; l 2 N; n D kl; k
A.x/ D l
A.y/g:
The topology of GA is generated by the sets f.x; kl; y/ 2 GA j x 2 P; y 2
Q; k
A.x/ D l
A.y/g, where P; Q  XA are open and k; l 2 N. Two elements .x; n; y/
and .x0; n0; y0/ in G are composable if and only if y D x0, and the multiplication and

We identify XA with the unit space G .0/
A

groupoid associated with the matrix A.
The groupoid GA is essentially principal and minimal.

Homology Groups
The homology groups Hn.G / of an étale groupoid G were ﬁrst introduced and
studied by Crainic and Moerdijk in [7]. In the case that the unit space G .0/ is a Cantor
set, we investigated connections between the homology groups and dynamical
properties of G in [27–29]. In this section, we would like to recall the deﬁnition
of Hn.G / for an étale groupoid G whose unit space is a Cantor set.
Let A be a topological abelian group. For a locally compact Hausdorff space
X, we denote by Cc.X; A/ the set of A-valued continuous functions with compact
support. When X is compact, we simply write C.X; A/. With pointwise addition,
Cc.X; A/ is an abelian group. Let  W X ! Y be a local homeomorphism between
locally compact Hausdorff spaces. For f 2 Cc.X; A/, we deﬁne a map . f/ W Y !
A by
. f/.y/ D
X
.x/Dy
f.x/:
It is not so hard to see that . f/ belongs to Cc.Y; A/ and that  is a homo-
morphism from Cc.X; A/ to Cc.Y; A/. Besides, if 0 W Y ! Z is another local
homeomorphism to a locally compact Hausdorff space Z, then one can check
.0 ı / D 0
 ı  in a direct way. Thus, Cc.; A/ is a covariant functor from
the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces with local homeomorphisms to
the category of abelian groups with homomorphisms.
Let G be an étale groupoid. For n 2 N, we write G .n/ for the space of composable
strings of n elements in G , that is,
G .n/ D f.g1; g2; : : : ; gn/ 2 G n j s.gi/ D r.giC1/ for all i D 1; 2; : : : ; n1g:

It is easy see that the abelian groups Cc.G .n/; A/ together with the boundary

Deﬁnition 3.1 ([7, Section 3.1], [27, Deﬁnition 3.1]) We let Hn.G ; A/ be the
homology groups of the Moore complex above, i.e. Hn.G ; A/ D ker @n= Im@nC1,
and call them the homology groups of G with constant coefﬁcients A. When A D Z,
we simply write Hn.G / D Hn.G ; Z/. In addition, we deﬁne
H0.G /C D fŒ f 2 H0.G / j f.x/  0 for all x 2 G .0/g;
where Œ f denotes the equivalence class of f 2 Cc.G .0/; Z/.
Remark 3.2 The pair .H0.G /; H0.G /C/ is not necessarily an ordered abelian group
in general, because H0.G /C \.H0.G /C/ may not equal f0g. In fact, when G is the
SFT groupoid, H0.G/C D H0.G/.
Example 3.3
1. Let G be an AF groupoid (see Example 2.2). There exists an isomorphism  W

2. Let G' be the transformation groupoid associated with a group action ' W  Õ X
(see Example 2.3). Then the homology groups Hn.G / is naturally isomorphic to
the usual group homology Hn.; C.X; Z// of  with coefﬁcients in Cc.X; Z/ (see
[5, Chapter III]).
3. Let GA be an SFT groupoid, where A is the adjacency matrix of an irreducible

Topological Full Groups
In this section, we introduce the deﬁnition of topological full groups.
Deﬁnition 4.1 ([27, Deﬁnition 2.3]) Let G be an essentially principal étale
groupoid whose unit space G .0/ is a Cantor set. The set of all ˛ 2 Homeo.G .0//
for which there exists a compact open G -set U satisfying ˛ D .U/ is called the
topological full group of G and denoted by ŒŒG .
For ˛ 2 ŒŒG  the compact open G -set U as above uniquely exists, because G
is essentially principal. Obviously ŒŒG  is a subgroup of Homeo.G .0//. Since G is
second countable, it has countably many compact open subsets, and so ŒŒG  is at
most countable.
A homeomorphism ˛ W G .0/ ! G .0/ belongs to ŒŒG  if and only if for any
x 2 G .0/ there exists a compact open G -set V such that x is in s.V/ and ˛ equals
.V/ on a neighborhood of x. Thus, ˛ is in ŒŒG  if and only if the ‘graph’ of ˛ is a
clopen subset of G .
Example 4.2 Let G be an AF groupoid arising from a Bratteli diagram .V; E/ (see
Example 2.2). For each k 2 N and v 2 Vk, we let Ev be the set of paths from a
vertex in V0 to the vertex v, i.e.
Ev D f.e1; e2; : : : ; ek/ j t.en/ D i.enC1/; t.ek/ D vg:

206
H. Matui
Suppose that a permutation v on Ev is given. Then we can deﬁne Qv 2 ŒŒG  by
Qv..en/n/ D

t.ek/ D v

v. It is easy to see
Gk Š
M
v2Vk
S#Ev;
Gk  GkC1
and ŒŒG  D S
k Gk. Thus, ŒŒG  is an increasing union of subgroups isomorphic to
ﬁnite direct sums of symmetric groups. Conversely, it is known that if ŒŒG  is locally
ﬁnite, then G is AF [26, Proposition 3.2].
Example 4.3 Let G' be the transformation groupoid associated with a group action
' W  Õ X (see Example 2.3). Suppose that G' is essentially principal. Take ˛ 2
ŒŒG'. There exists a compact open G'-set U such that ˛ D .U/. We can ﬁnd a
continuous map c W X !  such that U D f.c.x/; x/ j x 2 Xg. It follows that
˛.x/ D 'c.x/.x/ for all x 2 X.
Example 4.4 Let GA be an SFT groupoid, where A is the adjacency matrix of
an irreducible ﬁnite directed graph .V; E/ (see Example 2.5). We say that  D
.e1; e2; : : : ; ek/ 2 Ek is a path if t.ej/ D i.ejC1/ for every j D 1; 2; : : : ; k1. The
terminal vertex of  is written t./ D t.ek/. The length of  is written jj D k. For
a path  D .e1; e2; : : : ; ek/,
C D f.xn/n2N 2 XA j xj D ej
8j D 1; 2; : : : ; kg
is a clopen subset of XA and is called a cylinder set. For two paths  and  with
t./ D t./, we deﬁne a compact open GA-set U; by
U; D f.x; jjjj; y/ 2 GA j jj
A .x/ D jj
A .y/; x 2 C; y 2 Cg:
The subsets U; form a base for the topology of GA.
Take ˛ 2 ŒŒGA. There exist 1; 2; : : : ; m and 1; 2; : : : ; m such that the
following hold.
•
fCi j i D 1; 2; : : : ; mg is a clopen partition of XA.
•
fCi j i D 1; 2; : : : ; mg is a clopen partition of XA.
•
t.i/ D t.i/ for every i.
•
U D S
i Ui;i is a compact open G -set satisfying ˛ D .U/.
Let us consider the simplest case, namely that A is a 11 matrix Œn. The groupoid
C-algebra C
r .GŒn/ is the Cuntz algebra On. Nekrashevych [32, Proposition 9.6]
observed that the topological full group ŒŒGŒn is naturally isomorphic to the

Topological Full Groups of Étale Groupoids

Higman-Thompson group Vn;1. The group Vn;r is deﬁned to be the group of all
right continuous PL bijections f W Œ0; r/ ! Œ0; r/ with ﬁnitely many singularities
such that all singularities of f are in ZŒ1=n, the derivative of f at any non-singular
point is nk for some k 2 Z and f maps ZŒ1=n \ Œ0; r/ to itself. The isomorphism
 W ŒŒGŒn ! Vn;1 is described as follows. We identify the shift space XŒn with
f0; 1; : : : ; n1gN. Deﬁne a continuous map F W XŒn ! Œ0; 1 by
F..xk/k/ D

Then we have .˛/ ı F D F ı ˛ for any ˛ 2 ŒŒGŒn.
For an SFT groupoid GA, ŒŒGA is thought of as a generalization of the Higman-
Thompson group Vn;1.
When ˛ D .U/ is an element of ŒŒG , 1U 2 Cc.G / can be thought of as a
unitary in C
r .G /. This unitary 1U normalizes C.G .0//, namely 1Uf1
U D f ı ˛ holds
for every f 2 C.G .0//. Conversely, if u 2 C
r .G / is a normalizer of C.G .0// and
ufu D f ı ˛, then ˛ belongs to ŒŒG . Thus, we have the following.
Proposition 4.5 ([27, Proposition 5.6]) Suppose that G is an essentially principal
étale groupoid whose unit space G .0/ is a Cantor set. There exists a natural short
exact sequence
where N.C.G .0//; C
r .G // denotes the group of unitary normalizers of C.G .0// in
C
r .G /. Furthermore, the homomorphism  has a right inverse.
Next, we would like to introduce the index map I W ŒŒG  ! H1.G /.
Deﬁnition 4.6 ([27, Deﬁnition 7.1]) Let G be an essentially principal étale
groupoid whose unit space is a Cantor set. For ˛ 2 ŒŒG , a compact open G -set
U satisfying ˛ D .U/ uniquely exists. It is easy to see that 1U is a 1-cycle, i.e.
1U 2 Ker @1 (see Sect. 3). We deﬁne a map I W ŒŒG  ! H1.G/ by I.˛/ D Œ1U and
call it the index map.
It is easy to check that I W ŒŒG  ! H1.G / is a homomorphism. We write ŒŒG 0 D
Ker I. For ˛ D .U/ 2 ŒŒG , the element 1U may be regarded as a unitary of
C
r .G /, and so we can think about its K1-class Œ1U 2 K1.C
r .G //. It is a natural
open question to ﬁnd a connection between Œ1U 2 K1.C
r .G // and I.˛/ 2 H1.G /.
We made the following conjecture about abelianization ŒŒG ab and homology
groups Hn.G / in [29, Section 2.3].

208
H. Matui
Conjecture 4.7 (AH conjecture) Let G be an essentially principal minimal étale
groupoid whose unit space G .0/ is a Cantor set. Then there exists an exact sequence
Especially, if H0.G / is 2-divisible, then we have ŒŒG ab Š H1.G /.
Indeed, in many examples we can verify that there exists a short exact sequence
In such a case, we say that G satisﬁes the strong AH property. There exists G which
does not satisfy the strong AH property (but the AH conjecture is still true). See [33,
Example 7.1], [29, Section 5.5] or Theorem 8.12 (4).
The homomorphism H0.G / ˝ Z2 ! ŒŒG ab appearing in the AH conjecture is
described as follows. Let U be a compact open G -set satisfying r.U/ \ s.U/ D ;.
Deﬁne  2 ŒŒG  by

The homomorphism H0.G / ˝ Z2 ! ŒŒG ab sends the equivalence class of 1s.U/ ˝ N1
to the equivalence class of . Notice that it is not clear at all if this is really well-
deﬁned. One can ﬁnd a proof of the well-deﬁnedness in [33].
Example 4.8
1. Let G be an AF groupoid. In Example 4.2, we have seen that ŒŒG  is an increasing
union of the subgroups Gk Š L
v2Vk S#Ev. Clearly .Gk/ab is isomorphic to
L
v2Vk Z2. So, ŒŒG ab is an inductive limit of L
v2Vk Z2, and the connecting maps
are given by the edge sets Ek. Hence ŒŒG ab is isomorphic to H0.G / ˝ Z2 (see
[26, Section 3]). In particular, the AF groupoid G has the strong AH property.
2. Let G' be the transformation groupoid associated with a minimal group action
' W  Õ X. When  is Z, it was shown that ŒŒG'ab is isomorphic to H1.G'/ ˚
.H0.G'/ ˝ Z2/ [26, Section 4]. Thus, G' has the strong AH property. When 
is ZN, we can prove that the AH conjecture holds for G' (see Theorem 6.5 (3)).
But, we do not know whether or not G' satisﬁes the strong AH property. For
other group actions  Õ X, nothing is known.
3. Let GA be an SFT groupoid. It was proved that the abelianization ŒŒGAab is
isomorphic to H1.GA/ ˚ .H0.GA/ ˝ Z2/ [28, Corollary 6.24]. Thus, GA has the
strong AH property. See Theorem 8.6.

Isomorphism Theorem
In this section, we discuss the following theorem.
Theorem 5.1 ([28, Theorem 3.10]) For i D 1; 2, let Gi be an essentially principal
étale groupoid whose unit space is a Cantor set. Suppose that Gi is minimal. The
following conditions are equivalent.
1. G1 and G2 are isomorphic as étale groupoids.
2. ŒŒG1 and ŒŒG2 are isomorphic as discrete groups.
3. ŒŒG10 and ŒŒG20 are isomorphic as discrete groups.
4. D.ŒŒG1/ and D.ŒŒG2/ are isomorphic as discrete groups.
It clear that condition (1) implies the other conditions. The reverse implications
are nontrivial, and the essential part of the proof is contained in the following
proposition.
Proposition 5.2 ([28, Theorem 3.5, Proposition 3.6]) For i D 1; 2, let Gi be an
essentially principal étale groupoid whose unit space is a Cantor set. Suppose that
Gi is minimal. For each i D 1; 2, let i be a subgroup of ŒŒGi such that D.ŒŒGi/ 
i. If there exists an isomorphism ' W 1 ! 2, then there exists a homeomorphism
' W G .0/
1
! G .0/
2
such that '.˛/ D ' ı ˛ ı '1 for all ˛ 2 1.
This proposition says that any isomorphism between the groups 1 and 2
is spatially realized by a homeomorphism between the unit spaces. If we get a
homeomorphism ' W G .0/
1
! G .0/
2
such that '.˛/ D ' ı ˛ ı '1, then it is not
so hard to see that ' gives rise to an isomorphism from G1 to G2. Therefore we can
prove the remaining implications of Theorem 5.1.
In the setting of topological dynamical systems, Theorem 5.1 was ﬁrst proved
by Giordano, Putnam and Skau [15] for minimal Z-actions. In order to obtain
the spatial realization (see the proposition above), they imported the method of
H. Dye, who proved the same isomorphism result for measure preserving ergodic
actions on Lebesgue spaces. We remark that for minimal Z-actions '1 and '2, G'1
is isomorphic to G'2 if and only if '1 is ﬂip conjugate to '2 [14, Theorem 2.4]. See
Theorem 8.1. Later, similar results were obtained by Bezuglyi and Medynets [1]
and by Medynets [30]. The proof of Theorem 5.1 given in [28] is along the same
line as these works.
The proposition above can be also thought of as an immediate consequence of
the following theorem of Rubin [37] (see also [3, Section 9], [33, Section 3.3]). Let
X be a topological space. We say that a subgroup   Homeo.X/ is locally dense
if for every x 2 X and every open set U  X with x 2 U, the closure of
f f.x/ j f 2 ; fj.X n U/ D id j.X n U/g
has nonempty interior.

210
H. Matui
Theorem 5.3 ([37, Corollary 3.5]) For i D 1; 2, let Xi be a locally compact,
Hausdorff topological spaces without isolated points and let i  Homeo.Xi/ be
subgroups. If 1 and 2 are isomorphic and are both locally dense, then for any
isomorphism ' W 1 ! 2 there exists a unique homeomorphism ' W X1 ! X2 such
that '.˛/ D ' ı ˛ ı '1 for all ˛ 2 1.
Recently, Nekrashevych [33] introduced two normal subgroups A.G /  S.G / 
ŒŒG . Roughly speaking, S.G / is the subgroup generated by all elements of order
two, and A.G / is the subgroup generated by all elements of order three (see [33] for
the precise deﬁnitions). They are analogs of the symmetric and alternating groups.
He proved that the same statement as Theorem 5.1 is true for A.G / and S.G /.

Almost Finite Groupoids
In this section, we list known and unknown properties of almost ﬁnite groupoids.
Let us begin with the deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 6.1 ([27, Deﬁnition 6.2]) Let G be an essentially principal étale
groupoid whose unit space is a Cantor set. We say that G is almost ﬁnite if for
any compact subset C  G and " > 0 there exists an elementary subgroupoid
K  G such that
#.CK x n K x/
#.K x/
< "
for all x 2 G .0/. We also remark that #.K .x// equals #.K x/, because K is
principal.
I remark that the idea of the deﬁnition above has its origin in the work of
Latrémolière and Ormes [22]. More precisely, the notion of almost ﬁniteness was
made so that the arguments of [22] proceed in an analogous way.
AF groupoids (see Example 2.2) are almost ﬁnite. Indeed, any compact subset
C  G is contained in an elementary subgroupoid K  G . As the next proposition
shows, there exist almost ﬁnite groupoids which are not AF.
Proposition 6.2 ([27, Lemma 6.3]) When ' W ZN Õ X is a free action of ZN on a
Cantor set X, the transformation groupoid G' is almost ﬁnite.
Deﬁnition 6.1 may remind the reader of the Følner condition for amenable
groups. It may be natural to expect that transformation groupoids arising from free
actions of amenable groups are almost ﬁnite. This is an important open question. In
fact, X. Li recently proved that the converse is true.
Proposition 6.3 ([23]) Let ' W  Õ X be a topologically free action of a discrete
countable group  on a Cantor set X. If G' is almost ﬁnite, then  is amenable.

Topological Full Groups of Étale Groupoids
211
It is also an interesting problem to compare the notion of almost ﬁnite groupoids
with almost AF groupoids, which were introduced by Phillips [34].
For a G -invariant probability measure  2 M.G /, we can deﬁne a homomor-
phism O W H0.G / ! R by
O.Œ f/ D
Z
f d:
It is clear that O.Œ1G .0// D 1 and O.H0.G /C/  Œ0; 1/. Thus O is a state on
.H0.G /; H0.G /C; Œ1G .0//. It is also easy to see that the map  7!
O gives an
isomorphism from M.G / to the state space.
Theorem 6.4 ([29, Theorem 3.4]) Let G be a minimal almost ﬁnite groupoid.
1. .H0.G /; H0.G /C/ is a simple, weakly unperforated, ordered abelian group with
the Riesz interpolation property.
2. The homomorphism  W H0.G / ! Aff.M.G // deﬁned by .Œ f/./ D O.Œ f/ has
uniformly dense range, where Aff.M.G // denotes the space of R-valued afﬁne
continuous functions on M.G /.
For topological full groups of almost ﬁnite groupoids, the following are known.
Theorem 6.5 ([27–29]) Let G be an almost ﬁnite groupoid.
1. If G is minimal, then the commutator subgroup D.ŒŒG / is simple.
2. The index map I W ŒŒG ! H1.G / is surjective.
3. If G is principal and minimal, then the AH conjecture holds for G .
Nekrashevych [33] recently proved that if an almost ﬁnite groupoid G is minimal
and expansive, then D.ŒŒG / is ﬁnitely generated (see [33] for the deﬁnition of
expansive groupoids).
In general, it is not known if every almost ﬁnite groupoid G satisﬁes the strong
AH property or not. In other words, we cannot prove that the homomorphism j W
H0.G / ˝ Z2 ! ŒŒG ab is always injective, and cannot ﬁnd an example such that the
map j has nontrivial kernel. However, for a minimal free action ' W ZN Õ X, one

Purely Inﬁnite Groupoids
In this section, we list known and unknown properties of purely inﬁnite groupoids.
Let us begin with the deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 7.1 ([28, Deﬁnition 4.9]) Let G be an essentially principal étale
groupoid whose unit space is a Cantor set.
1. A clopen set A  G .0/ is said to be properly inﬁnite if there exist compact open
G -sets U; V  G such that s.U/ D s.V/ D A, r.U/ [ r.V/  A and r.U/ \
r.V/ D ;.
2. We say that G is purely inﬁnite if every clopen set A  G .0/ is properly inﬁnite.
If G .0/ is properly inﬁnite, then the space M.G / of G -invariant probability
measure on G .0/ is empty. In addition, ŒŒG  contains the free product Z2  Z3 [28,
Proposition 4.10], and hence ŒŒG  is not amenable. If G is purely inﬁnite, then for
any nonempty clopen set Y  G .0/, the reduction G jY is again purely inﬁnite. The
SFT groupoids GA (see Example 2.5) are typical examples of purely inﬁnite minimal
groupoids. When G is purely inﬁnite and minimal, the reduced groupoid C-algebra
C
r .G / is purely inﬁnite and simple.
Compare the following theorem with Theorem 6.4
Theorem 7.2 ([28, Lemma 5.3]) Let G be a purely inﬁnite groupoid. For any
h 2 H0.G /, there exists a non-empty clopen set A  G .0/ such that Œ1A D h. In
particular, H0.G / D H0.G /C.
For topological full groups of purely inﬁnite groupoids, the following are known.
Theorem 7.3 ([28]) Let G be a purely inﬁnite groupoid.
1. If G is minimal, then the commutator subgroup D.ŒŒG / is simple.
2. The index map I W ŒŒG ! H1.G / is surjective.
Nekrashevych [33] recently proved that if a purely inﬁnite groupoid G is minimal
and expansive, then D.ŒŒG / is ﬁnitely generated (see [33] for the deﬁnition of
expansive groupoids).
It is not known if all minimal purely inﬁnite groupoids satisfy the AH conjecture.
Here, we describe a situation where the AH is inherited from a smaller groupoid to
a larger groupoid.

Topological Full Groups of Étale Groupoids
213
Proposition 7.4 ([29, Theorem 4.4, Proposition 4.5]) Let G be a minimal étale
groupoid. Let c W G ! Z be a continuous surjective homomorphism and let H D
Ker c. Assume either of the following conditions.
1. H is a principal, minimal, almost ﬁnite groupoid with M.H / D fg, and there
exists a real number 0 <  < 1 such that, for any compact open G -set U 
c1.1/, .r.U// D .s.U// holds.
2. H is a minimal, purely inﬁnite groupoid satisfying the AH conjecture.
Then, G is purely inﬁnite and satisﬁes the AH conjecture.
Example 7.5 Let GA be an SFT groupoid, where A is the adjacency matrix of
an irreducible ﬁnite directed graph .V; E/ (see Example 2.5). There exists a
topologically mixing one-sided SFT .XB; B/ such that GA Š GB [29, Lemma 5.6].
Deﬁne c W GB
! Z by c.x; n; y/ D n. Then c is a continuous surjective
homomorphism and H D Ker c is an AF groupoid. Since .XB; B/ is topologically
mixing (or equivalently the matrix B is primitive), H is minimal and M.H / is
a singleton. One can check that condition (1) of the proposition above is satisﬁed
(the real number  is the inverse of the Perron eigenvalue of B). Consequently, GB
satisﬁes the AH conjecture, and so does GA. (Indeed, we know that SFT groupoids
have the strong AH property, see Example 4.8 (3).)
By the same technique as the example above, we can prove the following.
Theorem 7.6 ([29, Theorem 5.8]) Let G D GA1  GA2      GAn be a product
groupoid of ﬁnitely many SFT groupoids. Then, G satisﬁes the AH conjecture
(Conjecture 4.7).

Various Examples
8.1
Minimal Z-Actions
In this subsection, we would like to review the results about étale groupoids of
minimal Z-actions on Cantor sets. Recall that these groupoids are almost ﬁnite
(Proposition 6.2). We identify a Z-action Z Õ X with a homeomorphism on X.
Theorem 8.1 ([14, Theorem 2.4]) For i D 1; 2, let 'i be a minimal homeomor-
phism on a Cantor set Xi. The following are equivalent.
1. The étale groupoids G'1 and G'2 are isomorphic to each other.
2. '1 is ﬂip conjugate to '2.
Proof We present a sketchy proof. (2))(1) is obvious. Suppose that  W G'1 ! G'2
is an isomorphism. We may assume X D X1 D X2 and jX is the identity. Hence
there exists a continuous map c W Z  X ! Z such that .n; x/ D .c.n; x/; x/.
One has '1.x/ D 'c.1;x/
2
.x/ for all x 2 X. Let C D maxfjc.1; x/j j x 2 Xg < 1.

214
H. Matui
It is easy to check that c.nCm; x/ D c.n; 'm
1 .x// C c.m; x/ holds for all m; n 2
Z and x 2 X. For each x 2 X, the map m 7! c.m; x/ is a bijection on Z, and
jc.mC1; x/  c.m; x/j  C. Therefore, we have two possibilities: c.m; x/ ! C1
as m ! C1 or c.m; x/ ! 1 as m ! C1. Without loss of generality, we may
assume that the former holds. Deﬁne b W X ! Z by
b.x/ D lim
N!1 #fn 2 N j c.n; x/  Ng  N:
Indeed, there exists M 2 N such that if c.n; x/ > M then n > 0. So, b.x/ D #fn 2
N j c.n; x/  Ng  N if N  M. Especially, b is continuous. Deﬁne a continuous
map  W X ! X by .x/ D 'b.x/
2
.x/. For sufﬁciently large N, we can verify
b.'1.x// D #fn 2 N j c.n; '1.x//  Ng  N
D #fn 2 N j c.nC1; x/  N C c.1; x/g  N
D #fn 2 N j c.n; x/  N C c.1; x/g  1  N
D #fn 2 N j c.n; x/  N C c.1; x/g  .N C c.1; x// C c.1; x/  1
D b.x/ C c.1; x/  1;
which implies '2 ı  D  ı '1. Since every orbit of '1 (or '2) is inﬁnite, one can
show that  is a homeomorphism. It follows that '1 is conjugate to '2.

Theorem 8.2 Let ' be a minimal homeomorphism on a Cantor set X.
1. H0.G'/ is isomorphic to C.X; Z/=f f  f ı ' j f 2 C.X; Z/g, H1.G'/ Š Z and
Hn.G'/ D 0 for n  2.
2. D.ŒŒG'/ is simple.
3. The index map I W ŒŒG' ! H1.G'/ is surjective.
4. ŒŒG'0=D.ŒŒG'/ is isomorphic to H0.G'/ ˝ Z2.
Proof
(1) is obvious because Hn.G'/ is isomorphic to the group homology
Hn.Z; C.X; Z//
(see Example 3.3 (2)).
(2) is a special case of Theorem 6.5 (1).
(3) is clear because of I.'/ D 1 2 Z D H1.G'/. (It can be also viewed as a special
case of Theorem 6.5 (2)).
We give a brief explanation of (4). See [26] for a detailed proof. Fix a point y 2 X.

Topological Full Groups of Étale Groupoids

Then H
is open and becomes a minimal AF subgroupoid with the relative
topology [16, Theorem 4.3]. Evidently ŒŒH  is a subgroup of ŒŒG'. As observed
in Example 4.2, the topological full group ŒŒH  of the AF groupoid H is an
increasing union of subgroups isomorphic to ﬁnite direct sums of symmetric groups,
and the inclusion map of each step is given by the edge set En. It follows that
D.ŒŒH / is an increasing union of subgroups isomorphic to ﬁnite direct sums of
alternating groups. Since H is minimal, we can easily deduce that D.ŒŒH / is
simple. From this, with some extra work, we get the simplicity of D.ŒŒG'/. On
the other hand, ŒŒH =D.ŒŒH / is isomorphic to an inductive limit of ﬁnite direct
sums of Z2, and the connecting map of each step is given by the edge set En. Hence
one has ŒŒH =D.ŒŒH / Š H0.H / ˝ Z2. The inclusion map H ! G induces
H0.H / Š H0.G'/, which implies ŒŒH =D.ŒŒH / Š H0.G'/ ˝ Z2. The index
map I kills all the elements of ﬁnite order, and so ŒŒH  is contained in ŒŒG'0.
Then, with some extra work, we can show ŒŒG'0=D.ŒŒG'/ Š H0.G'/ ˝ Z2.
ut
For ˛ 2 ŒŒG', I.˛/ 2 Z is computed as follows (see [15, Section 5] for the detailed
argument). Fix a '-invariant probability measure  2 M.G'/. By Example 4.3,
there exists a continuous map n W X ! Z such that ˛.x/ D 'n.x/.x/ for all x 2 X.
Deﬁne I0 W ŒŒG' ! R by
I0.˛/ D
Z
X
n.x/ d.x/:
It is easy to see that I0 is a homomorphism and I0.'/ D 1. By [15, Lemma 5.3]
(or [26, Lemma 4.1]), the group ŒŒG'0 is generated by elements of ﬁnite order.
Therefore the kernel of I0 contains ŒŒG'0. So, we can conclude I D I0.
We say that a homeomorphism ' on a Cantor set is expansive if there exists a
continuous map f from X to a ﬁnite set A such that f.'n.x// D f.'n.y// for all
n 2 Z implies x D y.
Theorem 8.3 ([26, Theorem 5.4, Theorem 5.7]) Let ' be a minimal homeomor-
phism on a Cantor set X.
1. D.ŒŒG'/ is ﬁnitely generated if and only if ' is expansive.
2. D.ŒŒG'/ never be ﬁnitely presented.
Notice that (1) is a special case of [33, Theorem 5.6]. In particular, the same
statement holds for any free minimal action ' W ZN Õ X. (2) was shown in [26]
by expressing .X; '/ as a decreasing ‘intersection’ of two-sided shifts of ﬁnite type.
Later, Grigorchuk and Medynets [18] proved that ŒŒG' is locally embeddable into
ﬁnite groups, which implies that D.ŒŒG'/ never be ﬁnitely presented. We do not
know if D.ŒŒG'/ can be ﬁnitely presented when ' is a free minimal action of ZN.
Juschenko and Monod obtained the following remarkable result.
Theorem 8.4 ([20, Theorem A]) Let ' be a minimal homeomorphism on a Cantor
set X. Then ŒŒG' is amenable.

216
H. Matui
In the proof of this theorem, the notion of extensive amenability plays the central
role. This property was ﬁrst introduced (without a name) in [20], and studied further
in [19, 21].
We recall the deﬁnition of extensive amenability from [19, Deﬁnition 1.1]. Let
˛ W G Õ Z be an action of a discrete group G on a set Z. We denote by Pf .Z/ the set
of all ﬁnite subsets of Z. The collection Pf .Z/ is an abelian group for the operation
 of symmetric difference. The action ˛ naturally extends to ˛ W G Õ Pf .Z/. We
say that ˛ W G Õ Z is extensively amenable if there exists a G-invariant mean (i.e.
ﬁnitely additive probability measure) m on Pf.Z/ such that m.fF 2 Pf .Z/ j E 
Fg/ D 1 for any E 2 Pf .Z/. In [20, Lemma 3.1], it was shown that ˛ W G Õ Z is
extensively amenable if and only if the action of Pf .Z/ Ì G on Pf .Z/ admits an
invariant mean.
We denote by W.Z/ the group of all permutations g of Z for which the quantity
supfjg. j/  jj j j 2 Zg is ﬁnite. In [20, Theorem C], it was shown that the natural
action W.Z/ Õ Z is extensively amenable. (This part is technically quite hard.) It
follows that the action of Pf.Z/ Ì W.Z/ on Pf .Z/ admits an invariant mean.
Let ' be a minimal homeomorphism on a Cantor set X. We would like to show
that ŒŒG' is amenable. Fix a point x 2 X. We can deﬁne a map  W ŒŒG' !
W.Z/ so that .'j.x// D './.j/.x/ for every  2 ŒŒG' and j 2 Z. The map
 is an injective homomorphism. Deﬁne a map Q W ŒŒG' ! Pf .Z/ Ì W.Z/ by
Q./ D .N./.N/; .// for  2 ŒŒG'. It is routine to check that Q is an
injective homomorphism. Since the action of Pf .Z/ Ì W.Z/ on Pf .Z/ admits an
invariant mean, in order to show the amenability of ŒŒG', it sufﬁces to prove that
the stabiliser in Q.ŒŒG'/ of E is amenable for any E 2 Pf .Z/. By [20, Lemma 4.1],
the stabiliser is locally ﬁnite, and hence amenable. This completes the proof.
In [19, 21], the notion of extensive amenability is used to prove amenability
of various kinds of groups. Among others, it was shown that all subgroups of the
group of interval exchange transformations that have angular components of rational
rank  2 are amenable [19, Theorem 5.1]. In particular, when ' W Z2 Õ X is
a free minimal action arising from two irrational rotations on the circle (see [17,
Example 30]), the topological full group ŒŒG' is amenable. On the other hand, it
is known that there exists a free minimal action ' W Z2 Õ X on a Cantor set such
that ŒŒG' contains the non-abelian free group [11]. It may be a rather complicated
problem to determine when ŒŒG' is amenable for ' W Z2 Õ X.
8.2
Shifts of Finite Type
In this subsection, we would like to review the results about étale groupoids of one-
sided shifts of ﬁnite type (see Deﬁnition 2.5). Note that these groupoids are purely
inﬁnite and minimal [28, Lemma 6.1].

Topological Full Groups of Étale Groupoids
217
Theorem 8.5 ([25, Theorem 3.6]) Let .XA; A/ and .XB; B/ be two irreducible
one-sided shifts of ﬁnite type. The following conditions are equivalent.
1. .XA; A/ and .XB; B/ are continuously orbit equivalent.
2. The étale groupoids GA and GB are isomorphic.
3. There exists an isomorphism ' W C

4. There exists an isomorphism  W H0.GA/ ! H0.GB/ such that .Œ1XA/ D Œ1XB

Coker.id At/.
Proof We present a sketchy proof of the theorem above. The equivalence (1) ”
(2) directly follows from the deﬁnition. The equivalence (2) ” (3) is a special
case of Theorem 2.1.
(4))(3). Let . NXA; NA/ and . NXB; NB/ denote the two-sided shifts of ﬁnite type. By
the result of Franks [13], H0.GA/ Š H0.GB/ and
sgn.det.id A// D sgn.det.id B//
imply that . NXA; NA/ and . NXB; NB/ are ﬂow equivalent. It follows from [8, Theo-
rem 4.1] that there exists an isomorphism ' W C
r .GA/ ˝ K
! C
r .GB/ ˝ K
such that '.C.XA/ ˝ C / D C.XB/ ˝ C , where C
Š c0.Z/ is the maximal
abelian subalgebra of K consisting of diagonal operators. Since the isomorphism
 W H0.GA/ ! H0.GB/ carries Œ1XA to Œ1XB, a suitable modiﬁcation of ' yields the
desired isomorphism.
(2))(4). Clearly, GA Š GB implies .H0.GA/; Œ1XA/ Š .H0.GB/; Œ1XB/. The
ordered cohomology group of . NXA; NA/, introduced by Boyle and Handelman [2],
is the abelian group NHA D C. NXA; Z/=f   ı NA j  2 C. NXA; Z/g with the

C D fŒ 2 NHA j   0g. We can prove that GA Š GB implies

C/ (see [25, Theorem 3.5]). Then, by [2, Theorem 1.12],
. NXA; NA/ and . NXB; NB/ are ﬂow equivalent. As a result, we obtain sgn.det.id A// D
sgn.det.id B//.

Theorem 8.6 Let GA be an SFT groupoid.
1. D.ŒŒGA/ is simple.
2. The index map I W ŒŒGA ! H1.GA/ is surjective.
3. ŒŒGA0=D.ŒŒGA/ is isomorphic to H0.GA/ ˝ Z2.
Proof (1) and (2) immediately follow from Theorem 7.3 (1) and (2).
(3). By Example 7.5,
is exact. It sufﬁces to show that j is injective and has a left inverse. This was shown
in [28, Section 6.6], by using a ﬁnite presentation of ŒŒGA. Here, we would like to
describe another approach.
As mentioned in Example 4.4, when A is a 11 matrix Œn, ŒŒGŒn is the Higman-
Thompson group Vn;1. It is well-known that the abelianization of Vn;1 is trivial if
n is even, and is Z2 if n is odd. Suppose that an SFT groupoid GA is given. Let
' W H0.GA/ ! Z2 Š H0.GŒ3/ be a homomorphism. Choose a nonempty clopen set
Y  XŒ3 so that Œ1Y D '.Œ1XA/. Set H D GŒ3jY. We have ŒŒH ab Š Z2. By
Theorem 8.7, we can ﬁnd an embedding  W C
r .GA/ ! C
r .H / which induces
and '.Œ1P/ D Œ.1P/ for any clopen set P  XA. Let us denote the embedding
ŒŒGA ! ŒŒH  (and also the induced homomorphism ŒŒGAab ! ŒŒH ab) by .
Let U be a compact open GA-set satisfying r.U/ \ s.U/ D ;. Deﬁne U 2 ŒŒGA by

Then j.Œ1s.U/ ˝ N1/ equals the equivalence class of U in ŒŒGAab. It is easy to see
that the equivalence class of .U/ equals j.'.Œ1s.U// ˝ N1/. Thus, . j.Œ1s.U/ ˝
N1// D j.'.Œ1s.U// ˝ N1/. Hence  ı j D j ı .' ˝ id/. Since the homomorphism
' W H0.GA/ ! Z2 Š H0.GŒ3/ was arbitrary, we obtain the desired conclusion.
ut
In the proof above, we use the following embedding theorem.

Topological Full Groups of Étale Groupoids
219
Theorem 8.7 ([29, Proposition 5.14]) Let GA be an SFT groupoid and let H be
a minimal, purely inﬁnite étale groupoid. Suppose that ' W H0.GA/ ! H0.H /
is a homomorphism satisfying '.Œ1XA/ D Œ1H .0/. Then there exists a unital
homomorphism  W C
r .GA/ ! C
r .H / such that the following hold.
1. .C.XA//  C.H .0//.
2. For any compact open GA-set U, there exists a compact open H -set V such that
.1U/ D 1V.
3. For any clopen set P  XA, Œ.1P/ D '.Œ1P/ in H0.H /.
In particular,  induces an embedding of ŒŒGA into ŒŒH .
The proof of this theorem uses the fact that the Cuntz-Krieger algebra C
r .GA/ is
characterized as the universal C-algebra generated by partial isometries subject to
the Cuntz-Krieger relations [8].
As for ﬁniteness condition, the following is known.
Theorem 8.8 ([28, Section 6]) Let GA be an SFT groupoid.
1. ŒŒGA is of type F1. (In particular, it is ﬁnitely presented.)
2. ŒŒGA0 and D.ŒŒGA/ are ﬁnitely generated.
For the Higman-Thompson groups Vn;r (and also Fn;r, Tn;r), Brown [6] proved
that they are of type F1. The theorem above is a generalization of this result, and
its proof uses Brown’s criterion [6, Corollary 3.3].
As mentioned in Sect. 7, ŒŒGA is not amenable, because GA is purely inﬁnite.
But, ŒŒGA has a weaker version of the amenability.
Theorem 8.9 ([28, Theorem 6.7]) Let GA be an SFT groupoid. The topological full
group ŒŒGA has the Haagerup property.
Farley [12] proved that the Higman-Thompson group V2;1 has the Haagerup
property. In [28], the Haagerup property of ŒŒGA was shown by modifying the
argument of [12]. But, making use of Theorem 8.7, we can embed ŒŒGA to ŒŒGŒ2 Š
V2;1, and so the Haagerup property of ŒŒGA follows immediately.
Soﬁcity and exactness of the Higman-Thompson groups (or ŒŒGA) is an impor-
tant open problem.

Products of Shifts of Finite Type
In this subsection, we would like to review the results about product groupoids G D

The topological full group of G D GA1  GA2      GAn is a generalization
of the higher dimensional Thompson groups nVk;r. Brin introduced the notion

Theorem 8.12 ([29, Theorem 5.23]) Let G be as above.
1. If k.i/ is even for some i, then ŒŒG ab Š .Zg/n1.
2. If k.i/ is odd for all i and #fi j k.i/ 2 4ZC3g  1, then ŒŒG ab Š Z2 ˚ .Zg/n1.
3. If k.i/ is odd for all i and #fi j k.i/ 2 4ZC3g D 2, then ŒŒG ab Š Z2g ˚ .Zg/n2.
4. If k.i/ is odd for all i and #fi j k.i/ 2 4ZC3g  3, then ŒŒG ab Š .Zg/n1. In
particular, G does not have the strong AH property.
Proof
(1). Since g is odd, Zg ˝ Z2 D 0. So ŒŒG ab Š .Zg/n1.
(2). Let us consider the case that k.i/ 2 4ZC1 for all i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. Let H
be the direct product of n copies of GŒ5. By [29, Lemma 5.19 (1)], there
exists a homomorphism  W ŒŒH ab ! Z2 such that  ı j is nonzero. (In
[29, Lemma 5.19 (1)], ŒŒH  is embedded into a group (named Wn;k), and
its generators and relations are explicitly written down. Using them, one can
obtain the homomorphism  to Z2.) For each i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, we deﬁne
a homomorphism 'i W H0.GŒk.i// ! H0.GŒ5/ by 'i.N1/ D
N1. Applying
Theorem 8.7 to each 'i, we get an embedding  W ŒŒG  ! ŒŒH . In the
same way as the proof of Theorem 8.6 (3), one can conclude that  ı  ı j is
nonzero. Thus, ŒŒG ab Š Z2 ˚ .Zg/n1.
When k.i/ is odd for all i and #fi j k.i/ 2 4ZC3g D 1, the same argument
works by using [29, Lemma 5.19 (2)].
(3). Almost the same argument as above works, by using [29, Lemma 5.19 (3)].
But, the range of the homomorphism  becomes Z4. Thus, the map j W H0.G /˝
Z2 ! ŒŒG ab is injective but does not have a right inverse. Hence, we can
conclude ŒŒG ab Š Z2g ˚ .Zg/n2.
(4). For simplicity, we assume n D 3 and k.1/ D k.2/ D k.3/ D 3. It sufﬁces to
show that j W H0.G / ˝ Z2 ! ŒŒG ab is zero.

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum
Groups of Lie Type
Sergey Neshveyev and Makoto Yamashita
Abstract This is a survey of recent results on classiﬁcation of compact quantum
groups of Lie type, by which we mean quantum groups with the same fusion
rules and dimensions of representations as for a compact connected Lie group G.
The classiﬁcation is based on a categorical duality for quantum group actions
recently developed by De Commer and the authors in the spirit of Woronowicz’s
Tannaka–Krein duality theorem. The duality establishes a correspondence between
the actions of a compact quantum group H on unital C-algebras and the module
categories over its representation category Rep H. This is further reﬁned to a
correspondence between the braided-commutative Yetter–Drinfeld H-algebras and
the tensor functors from Rep H. Combined with the more analytical theory of
Poisson boundaries, this leads to a classiﬁcation of dimension-preserving ﬁber
functors on the representation category of any coamenable compact quantum group
in terms of its maximal Kac quantum subgroup, which is the maximal torus for the
q-deformation of G if q ¤ 1. Together with earlier results on autoequivalences of
the categories Rep Gq, this allows us to classify up to isomorphism a large class of
quantum groups of G-type for compact connected simple Lie groups G. In the case
of G D SU.n/ this class exhausts all non-Kac quantum groups.

Introduction
The theory of quantum groups has two origins. One is the algebraic approach
motivated by the quantum inverse scattering method and initiated by the discovery
of quantized universal enveloping algebras by Drinfeld [10] and Jimbo [17]. The
other is the operator algebraic approach developed by Woronowicz [56], which

stands on the philosophy of treating noncommutative C-algebras as functions on
‘noncommutative spaces’, or ‘pseudospaces’ in Woronowicz’s terminology. In both
frameworks, deformations of SU.2/ and, more generally, of the compact simple Lie
groups appear as the most fundamental and motivating examples.
A natural question is to classify all such deformations within a reasonable system
of axioms. At the inﬁnitesimal level, this was already settled in a series of papers by
Drinfeld and his collaborators during the 1980s. If one assumes compatibility with
the compact form, the classiﬁcation takes a particularly elegant form [2, 11, 49]:
if g is a complex simple Lie algebra and G is the simply connected compact Lie
group corresponding to g, any inﬁnitesimal deformation of the universal enveloping
algebra U .g/ as a quasitriangular -Hopf algebra corresponds to a Poisson–
Lie group structure on G, and those are parametrized, up to isomorphisms and
rescalings, by invariant Poisson structures on a maximal torus. Moreover, these
deformations make perfect sense in Woronowicz’s framework and give rise to strict
deformation quantization of the corresponding Poisson structures in the sense of
Rieffel [46].
Extending this classiﬁcation from inﬁnitesimal to analytical level, or in other
words, going from formal to strict deformation quantization, is a nontrivial task.
Since there is no analogue of Kontsevich’s classiﬁcation theorem in the analytical
setting, we cannot expect such a clean result as in the formal case without imposing
ﬁrst an additional symmetry. One possible idea is to require the deformations to have
the same combinatorial structure of representation theory, meaning the fusion rules
and dimensions of representations, as in the classical case. This implies that we can
take the coalgebra of matrix coefﬁcients independent of the deformation parameter,
and then try to ﬁnd a suitable algebra structure on it. Moreover, if we want to
preserve quasitriangularity, the Faddeev–Reshetikhin–Takhtadzhyan method [47]
reduces the problem to ﬁnding R-matrices with certain algebraic symmetry. Still,
carrying out such a classiﬁcation directly is not an easy task, and this has been only
worked out for the quantum groups with representation theory of SU.2/ [57] and of
SU.3/ [38, 39].
Our approach to this problem consists of a combination of cohomological and
analytical methods for tensor categories and related constructions for quantum
groups. Suppose we want to classify all quantum groups which have the same
fusion rules and dimensions of representations as a compact group G. In view of
Woronowicz’s Tannaka–Krein duality theorem, the problem can be divided into
three parts:
– classiﬁcation of rigid C-tensor categories C with fusion rules of G;
– classiﬁcation of monoidal autoequivalences of C ;
– classiﬁcation of unitary ﬁber functors C
!
Hilbf inducing the classical
dimension function on the representation ring of G.
We will mainly concentrate on the third problem, where the most recent advances
are. Let us explain the strategy in more detail, in roughly the same order as we
proceed from Sect. 4 to Sect. 6.

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum Groups of Lie Type
227
The ﬁrst step is to establish a duality between the category of unital H-C-
algebras and that of .Rep H/-module categories for compact quantum groups H
[8, 28]. Given an H-C-algebra B, which represents a noncommutative H-space
X, we take the category of H-equivariant Hermitian vector bundles on X, that is,
of ﬁnitely generated projective H-equivariant Hilbert B-modules. We can consider
the tensor product of such modules and ﬁnite dimensional unitary representations
of H, which leads to the structure of a .Rep H/-module category. An analogue of
the reconstruction procedure in Woronowicz’s Tannaka–Krein theorem implies that
B can be recovered from this module category and the distinguished object in it
represented by B itself.
Further pursuing this duality, we have the following correspondence for sub-
classes of H-C-algebras and .Rep H/-module categories [33]. Among the H-
C-algebras we consider the braided-commutative Yetter–Drinfeld algebras, while
among the module categories we take the C-tensor categories with module
structure induced by a tensor functor from Rep H. A motivating example for this
duality is the coideal of the function algebra coming from a quantum subgroup
K of H, on one side, and the forgetful functor Rep H ! Rep K, on the other.
In this formulation the quantum subgroup coideals precisely correspond to the
factorizations Rep H ! C ! Hilbf of the canonical ﬁber functor on Rep H through
some C-tensor category C .
One of our discoveries is that the noncommutative Poisson boundary of the
discrete dual of H, and its counterpart on the categorical side, ﬁts very well
into this scheme [34]. The noncommutative Poisson boundary, modeled on the
classical theory for discrete groups initiated by Furstenberg [14], was introduced by
Izumi [16] to understand the lack of minimality for inﬁnite tensor product actions
of non-Kac quantum groups. This theory requires the operator algebraic framework
in an essential way, and that is why we need to work with compact quantum groups
instead of, for example, cosemisimple Hopf algebras. We ﬁnd that the categorical
Poisson boundary has a universality property for what we call amenable tensor
functors. A concrete implication is that if Gq is the Drinfeld–Jimbo q-deformation
of a compact connected semisimple Lie group G with a maximal torus T, then
for q ¤ 1 the forgetful functor Rep Gq ! Rep T is a universal tensor functor
deﬁning the classical dimension function on Rep G. This shows that the undeformed
classical torus T < Gq can be detected already at the categorical level. This also
implies that the dimension-preserving ﬁber functors on Rep G are parametrized by
the invariant Poisson structures on the torus, or the Poisson–Lie group structures of
G, as expected from the case of inﬁnitesimal deformations.
Returning to the ﬁrst problem of classifying rigid C-tensor categories with
fusion rules of G, there is a simple class of examples of such categories in addition
to Rep Gq. We have a natural grading of Rep Gq by the Pontryagin dual of the center
of G, or more intrinsically, by the chain group of Rep Gq. Then any T-valued 3-
cocycle on the chain group deﬁnes an associator, and we obtain a twisted tensor
category, which has the same fusion rules as G. Note that this is analogous to, but
much easier than, the famous Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov associator constructed by

228
S. Neshveyev and M. Yamashita
Drinfeld, which relates Rep G and Rep Gq. What we wrote in the previous paragraph
about the categories Rep Gq applies equally well to these twisted categories and
allows us to classify dimension-preserving ﬁber functors on them. In the case
of SU.n/, up to monoidal equivalence, these exhaust the tensor categories with
fusion rules of SU.n/ [18, 21]. It seems reasonable to expect that a similar result
is true, or at least close to be true, for other simple Lie groups. Finally, the second
problem of classifying autoequivalences of such categories has been essentially
solved in [30, 31].
To summarize our results, for any compact connected simple Lie group G, we
classify up to isomorphism all compact quantum groups with the same fusion rules
and dimensions of representations as for G which, moreover, have representation
categories monoidally equivalent to Rep Gq for q ¤ 1 or to twists of such categories
by 3-cocycles on the dual of the center of G, see Theorems 6.3 and 6.8. Whether
such categories exhaust all categories with fusion rules of G beyond the case of
SU.n/, as well as whether one can say something precise for q D 1, are the main
remaining open questions.
2
Monoidal Categories
Throughout the exposition we ﬁx a universe and assume that all categories are
small [23]. See [32] for the details on the following notions.
2.1
C-Categories
A C-category is a category C with morphism sets C .U; V/ that are com-
plex Banach spaces, endowed with a complex conjugate involution C .U; V/ !
C .V; U/, T 7! T, satisfying the C-identity
kTTk D kTk2 D kTTk ;
and such that the composition of morphisms is bilinear and kSTk  kSk kTk. Unless
said otherwise, we always assume that C is closed under ﬁnite direct sums and
subobjects. The latter means that any idempotent in the endomorphism ring C .X/ D
C .X; X/ comes from a direct summand of X. The existence of ﬁnite direct sums
guarantees that, for any TW X ! Y, the morphism TT is positive as an element
in the C-algebra C .X/, which otherwise we would have to add as an additional
axiom.
An object is called simple if its endomorphism ring is isomorphic to C, and a C-
category is said to be semisimple if any object is isomorphic to a ﬁnite direct sum of
simple ones. We then denote the isomorphism classes of simple objects by Irr C and
assume that this is an at most countable set. Many results admit formulations which
do not require this assumption, and can be proved by considering subcategories

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum Groups of Lie Type

generated by countable sets of simple objects, but we leave this matter to the
interested reader.
A unitary functor, or a C-functor, is a linear functor of C-categories FW C !
C 0 satisfying F.T/ D F.T/.
A few times we will need to perform the following operation: starting from a
C-category C , we replace the morphisms sets by some larger multiplicative system
D.X; Y/ naturally containing the original C .X; Y/. Then we perform the idempotent
completion to construct a new category D. That is, we regard the projections p 2
D.X/ as objects in the new category, and take qD.X; Y/p as the morphism set from
the object represented by p 2 D.X/ to the one by q 2 D.Y/. Then the embeddings
C .X; Y/ ! D.X; Y/ can be considered as a C-functor C ! D.
2.2
C-Tensor Categories
A C-tensor category is a C-category endowed with a unitary bifunctor
˝W C  C ! C ;
a distinguished object 1 2 C , and natural unitary isomorphisms
1 ˝ U Š U Š U ˝ 1;
˚.U; V; W/W .U ˝ V/ ˝ W ! U ˝ .V ˝ W/
satisfying certain compatibility conditions. If these isomorphisms can be taken to be
the identity morphisms, then C is said to be strict.
We denote by Hilbf a category of ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces with a
strict model of tensor product (see, for example, [48] or [32, p. 37] for concrete
realizations).
A unitary tensor functor, or a C-tensor functor, between two C-tensor
categories C and C 0 is given by a triple .F0; F; F2/, where F is a C-functor
C ! C 0, F0 is a unitary isomorphism 1C 0 ! F.1C /, and F2 is a collection of
natural unitary isomorphisms F.U/ ˝ F.V/ ! F.U ˝ V/ compatible with the
structure morphisms of C and C 0.
As a rule, we denote tensor functors by just one symbol F. A tensor functor
between strict C-tensor categories is said to be strict if F0 and F2 are the identity
morphisms. The composition of tensor functors F and F 0 is deﬁned by taking the
usual composition of C-functors and setting .FF 0/2 D F.F 0
2/F2 and FF 0 D
F.F 0
0/F0. A natural transformation of tensor functors is a natural transformation
in the usual sense which is also compatible with the isomorphisms F2 and F0.
When the C-functor part of F is an equivalence of categories, F is said to
be a unitary monoidal equivalence. Analogously to the case of ordinary functors,
unitary monoidal equivalences can be inverted (up to a natural unitary monoidal
isomorphism) as unitary tensor functors, so for any F as above there is another
unitary monoidal equivalence F 0W C 0 ! C such that FF 0 and F 0F are naturally

230
S. Neshveyev and M. Yamashita
unitarily monoidally isomorphic to the identity functors of the respective categories.
If the target and source categories are the same, such a tensor functor F is called an
autoequivalence, and we denote by Aut˝.C / the group of autoequivalences of C
considered up to natural unitary monoidal isomorphisms. Let us also note that a
version of Mac Lane’s coherence theorem [23, Chapter XI] says that any C-tensor
category is unitarily monoidally equivalent to a strict one.
When C is a C-tensor category and U 2 C , an object V is said to be a dual
object of U if there are morphisms R 2 C .1; V˝U/ and NR 2 C .1; U˝V/ satisfying
the conjugate equations
.V ˝ NR/˚.R ˝ V/ D V;
.U ˝ R/˚.NR ˝ U/ D U;
where we assumed for simplicity that the unit is strict, so that 1˝U D U ˝1 D U.
If any object in C admits a dual, C is said to be rigid and we denote a choice of a
dual of U 2 C by NU.
Any rigid C-tensor category with simple unit has ﬁnite dimensional morphism
spaces and hence is automatically semisimple. The quantity
dC .U/ D min
.R;NR/ kRk
NR
 ;
where .R; NR/ runs through the set of solutions of conjugate equations as above, is
called the intrinsic dimension of U. We omit the superscript C when there is no
danger of confusion. A solution .R; NR/ of the conjugate equations for U is called
standard if
kRk D kNRk D d.U/1=2:
Solutions of the conjugate equations for U are unique up to the transformations
.R; NR/ 7! ..T ˝ /R; . ˝ T1/NR/:
Furthermore, if .R; NR/ is standard, then such a transformation deﬁnes a standard
solution if and only if T is unitary.
In a rigid C-tensor category C we often ﬁx standard solutions .RU; NRU/ of the
conjugate equations for every object U. Then C becomes spherical in the sense
that one has the equality R
U. ˝ T/RU D NR
U.T ˝ /NRU for any T 2 C .U/. The
normalized linear functional

is a tracial state on the ﬁnite dimensional C-algebra C .U/, called the normalized
categorical trace. It is independent of the choice of a standard solution.

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum Groups of Lie Type
231
For any semisimple C-tensor category we denote by KC.C / the Grothendieck
semiring of C . As an additive semigroup it is generated by the isomorphism
classes ŒU of objects in C and satisﬁes the relations ŒU ˚ V D ŒU C ŒV, so
it is the free commutative semigroup with generators ŒU 2 Irr C . The product is
deﬁned by ŒU ŒV D ŒU ˝ V.
Let us ﬁx representatives fUsgs2Irr C of the isomorphism classes of simple objects
of C . We will often use the subindex s to denote various construction related to Us.
For every object X 2 C , denote by X D .aX
st/s;t2Irr C the matrix describing the
multiplication by ŒX,
ŒX ŒUt D
X
s
aX
stŒUs;
so aX
st D dim C .Us; X ˝ Ut/. It is not difﬁcult to see that kXk  dC .X/. Moreover,
the same is true for any dimension function d in place of dC , by which one means
a unital semiring homomorphism dW KC.C / ! Œ0; C1/ such that d.ŒX/ D d.Œ NX/
for all X.
Another algebraic structure naturally associated with a semisimple C-tensor
category C is the chain group Ch.C /. It is the group with generators gs, s 2 Irr C ,
satisfying the relations gr D gsgt whenever Ur embeds into Us ˝ Ut. It is closely
related to the notion of grading on a category. For a discrete group  , we say that C
is graded over  if we are given full subcategories .Cg/g2 such that 1 2 Ce, any
object of C is isomorphic in an essentially unique way to a ﬁnite direct sum ˚gXg,
with Xg 2 Cg, and X ˝ Y is isomorphic to an object in Cgh if X 2 Cg and
Y 2 Ch. The chain group Ch.C / deﬁnes a grading on C : for every g 2 Ch.C /,
the subcategory Cg consists of direct sums of simple objects Us such that gs D g.
Any other grading over a group  deﬁnes a canonical homomorphism Ch.C / !  ,
so the chain group is a universal group over which C is graded.

Compact Quantum Groups
Compact quantum groups, or compact matrix pseudogroups as introduced by
Woronowicz [56], are our main object of interest. We again follow the presentation
of [32].
3.1
Tannaka–Krein Duality
A compact quantum group G is represented by a unital C-algebra C.G/ equipped
with a unital -homomorphism W C.G/ ! C.G/ ˝ C.G/ satisfying

232
S. Neshveyev and M. Yamashita
•
coassociativity: . ˝ / D . ˝ /,
•
cancellation properties: the linear spans of
.C.G/ ˝ 1/.C.G// and .1 ˝ C.G//.C.G//
are dense in C.G/ ˝ C.G/.
There is a unique state h on C.G/ satisfying .h ˝ / D h./1 (and/or . ˝ h/ D
h./1) called the Haar state. If h is faithful, C.G/ is called the reduced function
algebra of G, or G is called a reduced compact quantum group, and we are mainly
interested in such cases. By taking the image of C.G/ in the GNS representation of
h, we can always work with a reduced model.
A ﬁnite dimensional unitary representation of G is a unitary element U 2
B.HU/ ˝ C.G/ such that . ˝ /.U/ D U12U13, where HU is a ﬁnite dimensional
Hilbert space. The intertwiners between two representations U and V are the linear
maps T from HU to HV satisfying V.T ˝ 1/ D .T ˝ 1/U. The tensor product of
two representations U and V is deﬁned by U13V23 and denoted by U 
> V. This way,
the category Rep G of ﬁnite dimensional unitary representations with intertwiners
as morphisms and with tensor product 
> becomes a semisimple C-tensor category.
When ! is in the (pre)dual B.HU/ Š NHU ˝HU, the element .! ˝/.U/ 2 C.G/
is called the matrix coefﬁcient associated with !. The dense -subalgebra of C.G/
spanned by the matrix coefﬁcients of ﬁnite dimensional representations is called
the regular algebra of G, and is denoted by CŒG. This space is closed under the
coproduct, and becomes a Hopf -algebra. Its antipode is characterized by
. ˝ S/.U/ D U for U 2 Rep G:
Let us put U .G/ D CŒG. This space has the structure of a -algebra,
deﬁned by duality from the Hopf -algebra .CŒG; /. Every ﬁnite dimensional
unitary representation U of G deﬁnes a -representation U of U .G/ on HU by
U.!/ D .˝!/.U/. When convenient,we omit U and write ! instead of U.!/
for  2 HU.
An important ingredient of the duality for unitary representations of G is the
Woronowicz character f1 2 U .G/, which we denote by . Namely, the element
 2 U .G/ is uniquely determined by the properties that it is positive, invertible,
Tr.U.// D Tr.U.1//, and
NU D .j./1=2 ˝ 1/.j ˝ /.U/.j./1=2 ˝ 1/ 2 B. NHU/ ˝ CŒG;
is unitary, where U is any ﬁnite dimensional unitary representation and j denotes
the canonical -anti-isomorphism B.HU/ Š B. NHU/ deﬁned by j.T/N D T.
This element NU, which is again a unitary representation, is called the conjugate
representation of U. The representation NU is dual to U in the sense of Sect. 2.2, and

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum Groups of Lie Type
233
a convenient choice of solutions of the conjugate equations for U is given by
RU.1/ D
X
i
Ni ˝ 1=2i and NRU.1/ D
X
i
1=2i ˝ Ni;
where figi is an orthonormal basis in HU. This solution is standard. In particular,
the intrinsic dimension function on Rep G coincides with the quantum dimension
dimq U D Tr.U.//:
Therefore Rep G is a rigid C-tensor category. The forgetful functor U 7!
HU deﬁnes a strict unitary tensor functor into Hilbf called the canonical ﬁber
functor of G. Woronowicz’s Tannaka–Krein duality theorem recovers the -Hopf
algebra CŒG from these categorical data.
Theorem 3.1 ([58]) Let C be a rigid C-tensor category with simple unit, and
FW C ! Hilbf be a unitary tensor functor. Then there exist a compact quantum
group G, a unitary monoidal equivalence E W Rep G ! C , and a natural unitary
monoidal isomorphism from the canonical ﬁber functor of G to FE . Moreover, the
Hopf -algebra CŒG is determined uniquely up to isomorphism.
The key idea is that if C  Hilbf and F is the embedding functor, then, with
representatives fUsgs of Irr C and Hs D F.Us/, the coalgebra
M
s2Irr C
B.Hs/ Š

NHs ˝ Hs
admits an associative product induced by irreducible decompositions of tensor
products, which makes it into a bialgebra, analogously to the description of
the product of matrix coefﬁcients for usual compact groups. Moreover, standard
solutions of the conjugate equations determine the involution by the formula
NHs ˝ Hs 3 N ˝ 
 7! . ˝ /Rs ˝ .
 ˝ /NRs 2 NHNs ˝ HNs:
(3.1)
This way one obtains the -bialgebra CŒG.
The representation semiring of G is deﬁned as RC.G/ D KC.Rep G/. A possible
way of saying when a compact quantum group is a deformation of a genuine group
is as follows.
Deﬁnition 3.2 Given a compact group H, we say that a compact quantum group G
is of H-type if there exists a semiring isomorphism RC.G/ Š RC.H/ preserving the
(classical) dimensions of representations.
This deﬁnition is essentially due to Woronowicz [58]. In [1] the Hopf -algebras
CŒG for compact quantum groups G of H-type are called dimension-preserving
RC-deformations of CŒH.

234
S. Neshveyev and M. Yamashita
Problem 3.3 (cf. [58]) Given a compact connected Lie group H, classify the
compact quantum groups of H-type.
Our aim is to develop a general method to attack this problem, as outlined in
Sect. 1.
3.2
Cohomology of the Discrete Dual
Deformation problems for compact quantum groups are controlled by a cohomology
theory of the dual discrete quantum groups, which plays a central role in our
considerations. We again refer the reader to [32] for a more thorough discussion.
The -algebra U .G/ can be identiﬁed with Q
s2Irr G B.Hs/ (the algebraic direct
product) using the correspondence
CŒG 3 ! $ .Us.!//s 2
Y
s2Irr G
B.Hs/:
More generally, we can consider the algebra
U .Gk/ D .CŒG˝k/ Š
Y
s1;:::;sk2Irr G
B.Hs1/ ˝    ˝ B.Hsk/;
and interpret it as the space of (possibly unbounded) k-point functions on the
“discrete dual” quantum group OG. This is, for example, how the discrete quantum
groups are deﬁned in [53]. If G is a genuine commutative compact group, this agrees
with the usual notion of functions on the k-th power of the Pontryagin dual group OG.
The spaces U .Gk/ can be regarded as the components of the standard complex
for the group cohomology with multiplicative scalar coefﬁcients as follows. We call
the invertible elements of U .Gk/ the k-cochains on OG. Given a k-cochain !, we put
@0.!/ D 1 ˝ !;
@kC1.!/ D ! ˝ 1;
@j.!/ D Oj.!/
. O applied to the j-th position/;
(which are all in U .GkC1/), and call
@.!/ D @0.!/@2.!/    @2b kC1
2 c.!/@1.!1/@3.!1/    @2b k
2cC1.!1/
the coboundary of !. When @.!/ D 1, ! is said to be a k-cocycle. We denote the set
of k-cocycles by Zk. OGI C/. Two k-cocycles  and 0 are said to be cohomologous if
0 D @0.!/@2.!/    @2b k
2c.!/@1.!1/@3.!1/    @2b k1
2 cC1.!1/
holds for some .k  1/-cochain !.

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum Groups of Lie Type
235
In general the relation of being cohomologous is not even symmetric. But if it
happens to be an equivalence relation, the set of equivalence classes of k-cocycles is
denoted by Hk. OGI C/ and called the k-cohomology of OG. When one requires all the
ingredients to be unitary instead of invertible, the corresponding set is denoted by
Hk. OGI T/. If a k-cochain ! commutes with the image of Ok1 (deﬁned inductively
as . Ok2 ˝ / O), we say that ! is invariant. Invariant cocycles are also called lazy
in the algebraic literature. If we consider only invariant cocycles (with coboundaries
deﬁned also using only invariant cochains), we get sets Hk
G. OGI C/, and Hk
G. OGI T/
for the unitary case, whenever these sets are well-deﬁned.
When G is a commutative group, Hk
G. OGI T/ D Hk. OGI T/ agrees with the usual
group cohomology of the Pontryagin dual. We also note that, in general, if H is a
quantum subgroup of G, the natural inclusion U .Hk/ ! U .Gk/ induces maps from
the cohomologies of OH to those of OG.
We are mainly interested in the cohomology in low degrees (k  3), which have
direct connections with various aspects of Rep G. Let us brieﬂy summarize these
connections.
The set H1. OGI T/ D Z1. OGI T/ consists of unitary group-like elements in U .G/.
If G is a genuine compact group, then any such group-like element arises from an
element of G, so we have canonical isomorphisms
H1. OGI T/ Š G and H1
G. OGI T/ Š Z.G/:
For arbitrary G, a categorical interpretation of H1. OGI T/ is that this is the group of
unitary monoidal automorphisms of the canonical ﬁber functor FW Rep G ! Hilbf,
while the group H1
G. OGI T/ is the group of unitary monoidal automorphisms of the
identity functor on Rep G.
Next, a unitary 2-cochain x 2 U .G2/ is a 2-cocycle if and only if it satisﬁes
.x ˝ 1/. O ˝ /.x/ D .1 ˝ x/. ˝ O/.x/:
If c is a unitary element in the center of U .G/ (an invariant unitary 1-cochain), then
its coboundary is .c ˝ c/ O.c1/. The set of invariant unitary 2-cocycles forms a
group under multiplication, and the coboundaries form a subgroup. Thus, H2
G. OGI T/
becomes a group, called the invariant 2-cohomology group of OG.
If x is an invariant unitary 2-cocycle, the multiplication by x1 on HU ˝ HV can
be considered as a unitary endomorphism of U 
> V in Rep G. Such endomorphisms
form a natural unitary transformation of the bifunctor 
> into itself. The cocycle
condition corresponds to the fact that this transformation is a monoidal autoequiva-
lence of Rep G. Up to natural unitary monoidal isomorphisms, any autoequivalence
of Rep G ﬁxing the irreducible classes can be obtained in this way. Moreover,
the cohomology relation of cocycles corresponds to the natural unitary monoidal
isomorphism of autoequivalences. Thus H2
G. OGI T/ can be considered as the normal
subgroup of Aut˝.Rep G/ consisting of (isomorphism classes of) autoequivalences
that preserve the isomorphism classes of objects. Without the unitarity, H2
G. OGI C/

236
S. Neshveyev and M. Yamashita
corresponds to a subgroup of monoidal autoequivalences of Rep G as a tensor
category over C.
Let x be an arbitrary unitary 2-cocycle on OG, invariant or not. Then the triple
Fx D .idC; U 7! HU; x1/ deﬁnes a new unitary tensor functor Rep G ! Hilbf.
By Theorem 3.1, Fx can be considered as the canonical ﬁber functor of another
compact quantum group Gx satisfying Rep G D Rep Gx. Concretely, U .Gx/
coincides with U .G/ as a -algebra, but is endowed with the modiﬁed coproduct
Ox.T/ D x O.T/x1. By duality, CŒGx is the same coalgebra as CŒG, but has a
modiﬁed -algebra structure (pre)dual to .U .G/; Ox/.
Up to natural unitary monoidal isomorphisms, the functors Fx exhaust all unitary
tensor functors F 0W Rep G ! Hilbf satisfying dim F 0.U/ D dim HU. Moreover,
if T is a unitary element in U .G/, then xT D .T ˝ T/x O.T1/ deﬁnes another
unitary ﬁber functor which is naturally unitarily monoidally isomorphic to Fx.
Therefore the set H2. OGI T/ gives a parametrization of the set of isomorphism classes
of dimension-preserving unitary ﬁber functors Rep G ! Hilbf.
The group H2
G. OGI T/ acts on the set H2. OGI T/ by multiplication on the right.
This corresponds to the restriction of the obvious right action of Aut˝.Rep G/
on the natural unitary monoidal isomorphism classes of unitary ﬁber functors
Rep G ! Hilbf. Note that by Theorem 3.1, the orbits of this action by Aut˝.Rep G/
precisely correspond to the isomorphism classes of compact quantum groups with
representation category Rep G.
Let us move on to 3-cohomology. An invertible element ˚ 2 U .G3/ is a 3-
cocycle if and only if it satisﬁes
.1 ˝ ˚/. ˝ O ˝ /.˚/.˚ ˝ 1/ D . ˝  ˝ O/.˚/. O ˝  ˝ /.˚/:
Invariant 3-cocycles are also called associators. If ˚ is such a cocycle, its action
on HU ˝ HV ˝ HW can be considered as a new associativity morphism on the C-
category Rep G with bifunctor 
>. If ˚ is unitary, this gives a new C-tensor category
.Rep G; ˚/, which has the same data as Rep G except for the new associativity
morphisms deﬁned by the action of ˚. If C is a semisimple C-tensor category
with the same fusion rules as Rep G, that is, with the same Grothendieck semiring,
then by transporting the monoidal structure of C along any choice of a C-functor
C
! Rep G deﬁning the isomorphism KC.C / Š RC.G/, we see that C is
monoidally equivalent to some .Rep G; ˚/ as above. We remark that in general it is
not clear whether any such category is automatically rigid.
If x is an invariant unitary 2-cochain, the categories .Rep G; ˚/ and .Rep G; ˚x/
are naturally unitarily monoidally equivalent, by means of the unitary tensor functor
.id1; IdRep G; x1/W .Rep G; ˚/ ! .Rep G; ˚x/. This way the set H3
G. OGI T/ gives a
parametrization of the categories of the form .Rep G; ˚/ considered up to unitary
monoidal equivalences that preserve the isomorphism classes of objects.
A simple way of constructing elements of H3
G. OGI T/ is by considering the
chain group Ch.Rep G/, which we denote by Ch.G/. Namely, any cocycle  2
Z3.Ch.C /I T/ can be considered as a 3-cocycle on OG such that its component in
B.Hr/ ˝ B.Hs/ ˝ B.Ht/ is the scalar .gr; gs; gt/. We denote the category Rep G

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum Groups of Lie Type
237
with the associator given by this cocycle by .Rep G/. Therefore in .Rep G/ the
associativity morphism .U 
> V/ 
> W ! U 
> .V 
> W/ is the scalar operator
.g; h; k/ if U, V and W have the degrees g, h and k 2 Ch.G/, respectively. The
category .Rep G/ is always rigid.
Let us note in passing that the Pontryagin dual of the abelianization Ch.G/ab
of the chain group is naturally isomorphic to H1
G. OGI T/, cf. [4, 27]. Namely, any
character W Ch.G/ ! T deﬁnes a 1-cocycle ..gs//s2Irr C 2 U .G/, or equivalently,
a monoidal automorphism 
 of the identity functor on Rep G such that 

U D
.g/U if U has degree g 2 Ch.G/.
In particular, if G is a genuine group, then Ch.G/ is abelian and we get an
isomorphism Ch.G/ Š1
Z.G/. More concretely, if U is an irreducible representation
of G, then the group Z.G/ must be acting by scalars, that is, by some character
U 21
Z.G/, and the isomorphism Ch.G/ Š1
Z.G/ maps gs into Us.
3.3
q-Deformation
Let G be a simply connected compact Lie group with a maximal torus T, g be the
corresponding semisimple complex Lie algebra. Fix a system of simple roots and
denote the Cartan matrix by .aij/i;j. We ﬁx a scalar product deﬁning the root system
of G. When G is simple, such a scalar product is unique up to a scalar factor and we
normalize it so that for every short root ˛i we have .˛i; ˛i/ D 2.
For a ﬁxed positive real number q ¤ 1, the quantized universal enveloping
algebra Uq.g/ is the -Hopf algebra (over C) generated by elements Ei; Fi; K˙1

A ﬁnite dimensional representation of Uq.g/ is said to be admissible if it deﬁnes
a representation of the maximal torus T of G, so that the elements Ki act as the
elements qHi
i
in the complexiﬁcation of T, where Hi is the element of the Cartan
subalgebra of g deﬁned by ˛j.Hi/ D aij. The ﬁnite dimensional admissible unitary
representations form a rigid C-tensor category. Since it is given as a subcategory
of Hilbf, Woronowicz’s Tannaka–Krein theorem gives a compact quantum group,
which is called the q-deformation of Gq. The application of Woronowicz’s theorem
is a bit of an overkill here, and concretely, the Hopf -algebra CŒGq is deﬁned
as the subalgebra of Uq.g/ generated by the matrix coefﬁcients of admissible
representations. It is known that the quantum group Gq is of G-type according to
Deﬁnition 3.2.
The algebra of the discrete dual U .Gq/ can be regarded as a completion of Uq.g/
(although one should note that the latter has non-admissible representations which
do not extend to U .Gq/). The quantum group Gq contains T as a closed subgroup,
with the corresponding embedding U .T/ ,! U .Gq/ given by identifying qHi
i
with Ki. Intrinsically the torus T can be characterized as the maximal quantum Kac
subgroup of Gq, that is, the largest quantum subgroup of Gq on which the antipode
is involutive [51].
The center Z.G/  T of G is contained in the center of U .Gq/. It follows that
for any subgroup   Z.G/ the quantum group Gq= makes sense. This allows
one to deform compact connected semisimple Lie groups that are not necessarily
simply connected by letting .G= /q D Gq= . In other words, .G= /q is obtained
from Uq.g/ by considering only the admissible representations such that their
restrictions to T factor through T= , i.e., that have weights annihilating  .
It is known that for q ¤ 1 we have H1. OGqI T/ D T and H1
Gq. OGqI T/ D Z.G/,
which is a simple consequence of So˘ıbelman’s classiﬁcation of irreducible
representations of CŒGq [50]. The second cohomology will be described in
Sects. 5.2 and 6.1. As for the third cohomology, since Gq and G are known to
have the same fusion rules, there is a canonical bijection H3
Gq. OGqI T/ Š H3
G. OGI T/.
For the same reason there is a unique element in H3
G. OGI T/ corresponding
to Rep Gq. An associator ˚KZ;q representing this element was constructed by
Drinfeld [11] using the Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations (see also [20, 29]).
Since the categories Rep Gq are mutually inequivalent for different q 2 .0; 1,
we thus get a family of different classes Œ˚KZ;q
2
H3
G. OGI T/ indexed
by q
2
.0; 1. By our discussion in Sect. 3.2, there also are classes in
H3
G. OGI T/ coming from 3-cocycles on Ch.G/ Š 1
Z.G/, as well as from their
products with ˚KZ;q. What else is contained in H3
G. OGI T/, is a major open
problem.

Categorical Duality for Actions of Quantum Groups
In this section we describe several extensions of the Tannaka–Krein duality to
actions of compact quantum groups. These extensions are not strictly speaking
needed for the classiﬁcation problem for compact quantum groups, but they provide
motivation for some of the subsequent constructions.
4.1
G-Algebras and .Rep G/-Module Categories
Given a compact quantum group G, a unital G-C-algebra is a unital C-algebra B
equipped with a continuous left action ˛W B ! C.G/ ˝ B of G. This means that ˛
is an injective unital -homomorphism such that . ˝ /˛ D . ˝ ˛/˛ and such
that the space .C.G/ ˝ 1/˛.B/ is dense in C.G/ ˝ B. The linear span of spectral
subspaces,
B D fx 2 B j ˛.x/ 2 CŒG ˝alg Bg;
which is a dense -subalgebra of B, is called the regular subalgebra of B, and the
elements of B are called regular. More concretely, the algebra B is spanned by the
elements of the form .h ˝ /..x ˝ 1/˛.a// for x 2 CŒG and a 2 B. This algebra is
of central importance for the categorical reconstruction of B.
Next let us explain the categorical counterpart of the G-algebras. We also note
that a particular type of this structure plays a central role in the subfactor theory.
Deﬁnition 4.1 Let C be a C-tensor category. We say that D is a right C -module
category if
•
D is a C-category,
•
we are given a unitary bifunctor D  C ! D, denoted by .X; U/ 7! X  U, and
•
natural unitary isomorphisms
X  1 ! X;
.X  U/  V ! X  .U ˝ V/
(4.1)
satisfying the obvious compatibility conditions analogous to those for monoidal
categories.
When D and D0 are C -module categories, a C -module functor D ! D0
is a pair .F; /, where F is a C-functor from D to D0, and  is a unitary
natural transformation F.X/  U ! F.X  U/, again satisfying a standard set
of compatibility conditions. When  is obvious from context, we simply write F
instead of .F; /. The C -module functors can be composed in a way similar to the
monoidal functors.
We say that two C -module functors .F; /; .F 0; 0/W D ! D0 are equivalent
if there is a natural unitary transformation 
W F ! F 0 which is compatible with 

and 0. Note that this equivalence relation is compatible with composition of module
functors.
Our starting point is the following categorical duality theorem for G-algebras,
which could be called the Tannaka–Krein duality theorem for quantum group
actions. Results leading to this theorem have a long history, starting from the work of
Wassermann [54] and Landstad [22] in the early 1980s on full multiplicity ergodic
actions of compact groups, and continuing in [3, 40, 43, 52].
Theorem 4.2 ([8, 28]) Let G be a reduced compact quantum group. Then the
following two categories are equivalent:
1. The category of unital G-C-algebras, with unital G-equivariant -homomor-
phisms as morphisms.
2. The category of pairs .D; M/, where D is a right .Rep G/-module C-category
and M is a generating object in D, with equivalence classes of unitary .Rep G/-
module functors respecting the prescribed generating objects as morphisms.
The condition that D is generated by M means that any object in D is isomorphic
to a subobject of M  U for some U 2 Rep G.
Remark 4.3 Let End.D/ be the C-tensor category of C-endofunctors on D,
with uniformly bounded natural transformations as morphisms. Then, having a C -
module structure on D is the same as giving a unitary tensor functor FW C ˝op !
End.D/, where F0 and F2 correspond to the morphisms in (4.1). For G D SUq.2/
and, more generally, for free orthogonal quantum groups this point of view leads to
a combinatorial classiﬁcation of ergodic actions [9].
To describe the above equivalence, given a G-C-algebra .B; ˛/, we consider the
category DB of G-equivariant ﬁnitely generated right Hilbert B-modules. In other
words, objects of DB are ﬁnitely generated right Hilbert B-modules X equipped with
a linear map ı D ıXW X ! C.G/ ˝ X which satisﬁes the comultiplicativity property
. ˝ /ı D . ˝ ı/ı together with the following conditions:
•
.C.G/ ˝ 1/ı.X/ is dense in C.G/ ˝ X,
•
ı is compatible with the Hilbert B-module structure, in the sense that

Here, C.G/ ˝ X is considered as a right Hilbert .C.G/ ˝ B/-module.
For X 2 DB and U 2 Rep G, we obtain a new object X  U in DB given by the
linear space HU ˝ X, which is a right Hilbert B-module such that

This construction gives the structure of a right .Rep G/-module category on DB,
together with a distinguished object B 2 DB.
In the other direction, we construct what would be the regular subalgebra of a G-
algebra starting from a pair .D; M/ as in Theorem 4.2. The generating condition
on M implies that, by replacing D by an equivalent category, we may assume
that D is the idempotent completion of the category Rep G with larger morphism
sets D.U; V/ than in Rep G, such that M is the unit object 1 in Rep G and the
functor   U on D is an extension of the functor  
> U on Rep G. Namely, we
simply deﬁne the new set of morphisms between U and V as D.M  U; M 
V/.
Consider the linear space

Note that this gives CŒG if D is Hilbf with the action of Rep G induced by the

.N ˝ T/ D 1=2 ˝ .T ˝ /NRt
.N ˝ T 2 NHt ˝ D.1; Ut//:
The -algebra B has a natural left CŒG-comodule structure, deﬁned by the map
˛W B ! CŒG ˝ B such that if figi is an orthonormal basis in Ht and uij are the
matrix coefﬁcients of Ut in this basis, then
˛.Ni ˝ T/ D

It is shown then that the action ˛ is algebraic in the sense of [8, Deﬁnition 4.2],
meaning that the ﬁxed point algebra A D BG Š D.1/ is a unital C-algebra and
the conditional expectation .h ˝ /˛W B ! A is positive and faithful. It follows that
there is a unique completion of B to a C-algebra B such that ˛ extends to an action
of the reduced form of G on B. This ﬁnishes the construction of an action from a
module category.

Yetter–Drinfeld Algebras and Tensor Functors
An important class of G-C-algebras is the quantum homogeneous spaces deﬁned
by quantum subgroups. Namely, when fW CŒG ! CŒH is a surjective homomor-
phism of Hopf -algebras, the subalgebra
CŒG=H D fx 2 CŒGW . ˝ f/.x/ D x ˝ 1g
completes to a C.G/-comodule subalgebra of C.G/. As the notation suggests, this
should be regarded as the space of functions on the quotient G=H. The categorical
counterpart to this structure is the .Rep G/-module category Rep H, where Rep G
acts through the unitary tensor functor Rep G ! Rep H induced by f.
In general, we could ask when a .Rep G/-module category structure comes from
a tensor functor, or in other words, when the G-equivariant Hilbert B-modules admit
a tensor product operation. The answer is that the G-algebra structure of B should be
extended to that of a braided-commutative Yetter–Drinfeld G-algebra. Let us brieﬂy
recall the relevant deﬁnitions.
Assume we have a continuous left action of ˛W B ! C.G/ ˝ B of a compact
quantum group G on a unital C-algebra B, as well as a continuous right action
ˇW B ! M .B ˝ c0. OG// of the dual discrete quantum group OG. The action ˇ deﬁnes
a left CŒG-module algebra structure BW CŒG ˝ B ! B on B by
x B a D . ˝ x/ˇ.x/ for x 2 CŒG and a 2 B:
Here we view c0. OG/ as a subalgebra of U .G/ D CŒG. This structure is compatible
with involution, in the sense that
x B a D .S.x/ B a/:
Deﬁnition 4.4 We say that B is a Yetter–Drinfeld G-C-algebra if the following
identity holds for all x 2 CŒG and a 2 B:
˛.x B a/ D x.1/a.1/S.x.3// ˝ .x.2/ B a.2//;
where we use Sweedler’s sumless notation, so we write the effect of  and ˛ as
x.1/˝x.2/, etc. A Yetter–Drinfeld G-C-algebra B is said to be braided-commutative
if for all a; b 2 B we have
ab D b.2/.S1.b.1// B a/:
(4.2)
Note that when b is in the ﬁxed point algebra A D BG, the right hand side of the
above identity reduces to ba, and we see that A is contained in the center of B.

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum Groups of Lie Type
243
Remark 4.5 Yetter–Drinfeld G-C-algebras can be regarded as D.G/-C-algebras
for the Drinfeld double D.G/ of G, and they are studied in the more general setting
of locally compact quantum groups by Nest and Voigt [37].
The categorical counterpart of a braided-commutative Yetter–Drinfeld G-C-al-
gebra is a pair .C ; E /, where C is a C-tensor category and E W Rep G ! C is a
unitary tensor functor such that C is generated by the image of E . The condition
that C is generated by the image of E means that any object in C is isomorphic
to a subobject of E .U/ for some U 2 Rep G. We stress that we do not assume
that the unit in C is simple. In fact, the C-algebra C .1/ is exactly the ﬁxed point
subalgebra BG of the C-algebra B corresponding to .C ; E / in the next theorem.
Deﬁne the morphisms .C ; E / ! .C 0; E 0/ as the equivalence classes of pairs
.F; 
/, where F is a unitary tensor functor FW C
! C 0 and 
 is a natural
unitary monoidal isomorphism 
W FE ! E 0. We say that .F; 
/ and .F 0; 
0/
are equivalent if there is a natural unitary monoidal transformation of the unitary
tensor functors W F
! F 0 which is compatible with 
 and 
0 in the sense
that 
U D 
0
UE .U/W F.E .U// ! E 0.U/ for all U 2 C . Again, this relation is
compatible with the composition of morphisms, and we denote by Tens.Rep G/ the
category of pairs .C ; E / with morphisms given by the equivalence classes of this
relation.
Theorem 4.6 ([33]) Let G be a reduced compact quantum group. Then the follow-
ing two categories are equivalent:
1. The category YDbrc.G/ of unital braided-commutative Yetter–Drinfeld G-C-
algebras, with unital G- and OG-equivariant -homomorphisms as morphisms.
2. The category Tens.Rep G/.
Moreover, given a morphism Œ.F; 
/W .C ; E / ! .C 0; E 0/, the corresponding
homomorphism of Yetter–Drinfeld C-algebras is injective if and only if F is
faithful, and it is surjective if and only if F is full.
To prove this theorem we have to enhance the ingredients of Theorem 4.2.
Suppose that B is a Yetter–Drinfeld G-C-algebra. Then any G-equivariant right
Hilbert B-module X automatically admits a left action of B, given by
a D .2/.S1..1// B a/
.a 2 B;  2 X such that ıX./ 2 CŒG ˝alg X/;
that is, we interpret (4.2) as a formula for the left action on X. When B is braided-
commutative, (4.2) guarantees that X is a B-bimodule, and DB becomes a C-tensor
category with tensor product given by X ˝Y D Y ˝B X. Moreover, then U 7! BU
becomes a unitary tensor functor Rep G ! DB.
In the opposite direction, suppose E W Rep G ! C is a unitary tensor functor.
Similarly to the previous subsection, we may assume that it is simply an embedding
and construct a G-algebra B D ˚s. NHs ˝C .1; Us//. We then have to deﬁne a CŒG-

244
S. Neshveyev and M. Yamashita
module structure BW CŒG ˝ B ! B. It is deﬁned using the map
QBW . NHs ˝ Hs/ ˝ . NHt ˝ C .1; Ut// ! .Hs ˝ Ht ˝ NHs/ ˝ C .1; Us 

.N ˝ / QB .N
 ˝ T/ D . ˝ 
 ˝ 1=2/ ˝ . ˝ T ˝ /NRs;
by decomposing Us 
> Ut 
> NUs into irreducibles.
Let us now consider the case when the target category C is Hilbf. Then it can be
shown that Theorem 4.6 establishes a bijection between the isomorphism classes of
unitary ﬁber functors Rep G ! Hilbf and the isomorphism classes of unital Yetter–
Drinfeld G-C-algebras B such that
•
the G-algebra B is a Hopf–Galois extension of C over CŒG, meaning that BG D
C1 and the Galois map
 W B ˝ B ! CŒG ˝ B;
x ˝ y 7! x.1/ ˝ x.2/y;
(4.3)
is bijective,
•
the CŒG-module structure BW CŒG ˝ B ! B is completely determined by the
action of G and coincides with the Miyashita–Ulbrich action, deﬁned by
x B a D  1.x ˝ 1/1a 1.x ˝ 1/2:
In the purely algebraic setting the correspondence between ﬁber functors and
Hopf–Galois extensions of C over CŒG was established in [52]. In the operator
algebraic setting this was done in [3]. Note that in the last paper instead of bijectivity
of the Galois map an equivalent condition of full quantum multiplicity is considered.
4.3
Dual Category
Two most natural braided-commutative Yetter–Drinfeld algebras associated with
any compact quantum group G are the algebras of functions on G and on its discrete
dual OG. Let us consider the latter in more detail.
In the Hopf–von Neumann algebraic framework, the discrete dual is deﬁned by
`1. OG/ D `1-
M
s2IrrG
B.Hs/  U .G/:
We have a left adjoint action ˛ of G on `1. OG/ deﬁned by
B.Hs/ 3 T 7! .Us/
21.1 ˝ T/.Us/21:
(4.4)

This action is continuous only in the von Neumann algebraic sense, so in order
to stay within the class of G-C-algebras, instead of `1. OG/ we consider the norm
closure B. OG/ of the regular subalgebra `1
alg. OG/  `1. OG/. The right action O of
OG on `1. OG/ makes this algebra into a unital braided-commutative Yetter–Drinfeld
C-algebra. In other words, the left CŒG-module structure on `1
alg. OG/ is deﬁned by
x B a D . ˝ x/ O.a/:
We want to describe the corresponding C-tensor category OC D CB. OG/ and
the unitary tensor functor F
D FB. OG/W Rep G !
OC . The category
OC is the
idempotent completion of the category with the same objects as in Rep G, but with
morphism sets OC .U; V/  B.HU; HV/ ˝ `1
alg. OG/. In this picture F is the obvious
embedding functor. For the reasons that will become apparent in a moment, it is
more convenient to consider OC .U; V/ as a subset of `1
alg. OG/ ˝ B.HU; HV/. Then
OC .U; V/ is the set of elements T 2 `1
alg. OG/ ˝ B.HU; HV/ such that
V

From the deﬁnition of the adjoint action ˛ we see that an element T 2 `1

Poisson Boundary
An essential ingredient in the classiﬁcation of ﬁber functors is the notion of non-
commutative Poisson boundary and its categorical counterpart, and the universality
of the latter with respect to amenable tensor functors.

5.1
Noncommutative Poisson Boundary
For a ﬁnite dimensional unitary representation U of G, consider the state U
on B.HU/ deﬁned by
U.T/ D Tr.TU./1/
dimq U
for T 2 B.H/:
If U is irreducible, it can be characterized as the unique state satisfying
. ˝ U/.U
21.1 ˝ T/U21/ D U.T/:
For our ﬁxed representatives of irreducible representations fUsgs of G, we write s
instead of Us.
When  is a normal state on `1. OG/, we deﬁne a completely positive map P
on `1. OG/ by
P.a/ D . ˝ / O.a/:
If  is a probability measure on Irr G, we then deﬁne a normal unital completely
positive map P on `1. OG/ by P D P
s .s/Ps. The space
H1. OGI / D fx 2 `1. OG/ j x D P.x/g
of P-harmonic elements is called the noncommutative Poisson boundary [16] of
OG with respect to . This is an operator subspace of `1. OG/ closed under the left
adjoint action ˛ of G deﬁned by (4.4) and the right action O of OG on itself by
translations. It has a new product structure
x  y D lim
n!1 Pn
.xy/;
(5.1)
where the limit is taken in the strong operator topology. With this product
H1. OGI / becomes a von Neumann algebra (with the original operator space
structure) [7], which can be regarded as a generalization of the classical Poisson
boundary [19]. Moreover, the actions of G and OG on `1. OG/ deﬁne continuous
actions on H1. OGI / in the von Neumann algebraic sense.
5.2
Categorical Poisson Boundary
Using the categorical description of the discrete duals of compact quantum groups
given in Sect. 4.3, we have a straightforward translation of noncommutative Poisson
boundaries to its categorical counterpart [34].

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum Groups of Lie Type
247
Let C be a strict rigid C-tensor category with simple unit. Consider the
category OC deﬁned as in Sect. 4.3 for C D Rep G. We have “partial trace” maps
trU ˝W C .U ˝ X; U ˝ Y/ ! C .X; Y/;
T 7!

d.U/.R
U ˝ /. ˝ T/.RU ˝ /:
Using them we can deﬁne an operator PU on OC .V; W/ by
.PU.
//X D .trU ˝/.
U˝X/ 2 C .X ˝ V; X ˝ W/:
As before, ﬁx representatives Us of isomorphism classes of simple objects and
write Ps for PUs. Let  be a probability measure on Irr C . Deﬁne an operator P
acting on Natb. ˝ V;  ˝ W/ by P D P
s .s/Ps. It is called the Markov operator
associated with . A bounded natural transformation 
W ˝V ! ˝W is called P-
harmonic if P.
/ D 
. We denote the set of P-harmonic natural transformations
 ˝ V !  ˝ W by P.C I /.V; W/, or just by P.V; W/.
As is the case for usual harmonic functions, the naive product of harmonic
transformation is not guaranteed to be harmonic. However, the formula (5.1) still
makes sense, and P.C I /.V; W/ can be considered as a morphism set of a new
C-category. We denote the subobject completion of this category by P.C I /, or
simply by P.
The category P has the natural structure of a C-tensor category deﬁned
similarly to OC . Namely, at the level of objects (before the subobject completion),
the tensor product ˝ is the same as in C , while the tensor product of morphisms is
given by
 ˝ 
 D . ˝ /  . ˝ 
/;
where  ˝  and  ˝ 
 are deﬁned in the same way (4.5) as in OC .
Any morphism TW V ! W in C deﬁnes a bounded natural transformation
.X ˝ T/X from  ˝ V into  ˝ W, which is obviously P-harmonic for every .
This embedding of C -morphisms into P-morphisms deﬁnes a strict unitary tensor
functor ˘W C ! P.
Deﬁnition 5.1 ([34]) The pair .P; ˘/ is called the Poisson boundary of .C ; /.
Note that OC .1/ D `1.Irr C /. A probability measure  on Irr C is called ergodic,
if the only P-harmonic bounded functions on Irr C are the constant functions.
This means that P.C I / still has a simple unit. It can be shown that such a 
exists if and only if the intrinsic dimension function on C is weakly amenable in
the terminology of [15], meaning that there exists a state on `1.Irr C / which is
Ps-invariant for all s. In this case we say that C is weakly amenable. For weakly
amenable categories, the Poisson boundary has the following universal property.

248
S. Neshveyev and M. Yamashita
Theorem 5.2 ([34]) Let C be a rigid C-tensor category with simple unit, and 
be an ergodic probability measure on Irr C . Then the equality
dP.C I/.˘.X// D kXk
holds for all X 2 C . Moreover, if C 0 is another C-tensor category with simple unit,
and FW C ! C 0 is a unitary tensor functor such that dC 0.F.X// D kXk holds
for all X, then there exists a unitary tensor functor E W P.C I / ! C 0, unique up
to a natural unitary monoidal isomorphism, such that E ˘ is naturally unitarily
monoidally isomorphic to F.
Note that the subcategory generated by the image of F is rigid, although the
standard solutions for F.U/ might not be in the image of F.
The proof of the above theorem consists of two parts, which rely on very different
techniques. One part establishes a universal property of the Poisson boundary
among the functors deﬁning the smallest dimension function on C . It relies on a
study of certain completely positive maps and their multiplicative domains, which
can be thought of as analogues of the classical Poisson integral. The second part
shows that the smallest dimension function must be X 7! kXk. The proof relies on
subfactor theory and is inspired by the works of Pimsner and Popa [41, 45]. It is clear
that the second part is not needed once we have at least one functor FW C ! C 0
such that dC 0.F.X// D kXk, as is the case in the applications we describe below.
Let us draw some implications of Theorem 5.2 for C D Rep G for a compact
quantum group G. Recall that G is called coamenable if OG is amenable. By a Kesten-
type criterion this is equivalent to requiring kUk D dim U for all U 2 Rep G.
Furthermore, coamenability of G implies weak amenability of Rep G, so the above
theorem can be applied. In our current setting the theorem says that there exists a
universal unitary tensor functor ˘W Rep G ! P such that dP.˘.U// D dim U for
all U. By universality and Woronowicz’s Tannaka–Krein duality this functor must
correspond to a quantum subgroup of G. Since the classical and quantum dimension
functions coincide only in the Kac case, it is not difﬁcult to ﬁgure out what this
quantum subgroup must be and obtain the following result.
Theorem 5.3 ([35]) Let G be a coamenable compact quantum group, K < G its
maximal quantum subgroup of Kac type. Then the forgetful functor Rep G ! Rep K
is a universal unitary tensor functor deﬁning the classical dimension function on
Rep G.
Using the correspondence between the noncommutative and categorical bound-
aries, this implies that if G is a coamenable compact quantum group and  is an
ergodic probability measure on Irr G, then the Poisson boundary H1. OGI / is G-
and OG-equivariantly isomorphic to L1.G=K/. This result was originally proved by
Tomatsu [51] (he states the result in a more restricted form, but in fact his proof
works in the generality we formulated).

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum Groups of Lie Type
249
What is more important for our deformation problems, Theorem 5.3 sometimes
allows us to reduce the classiﬁcation of dimension-preserving ﬁber functors to an
easier task.
Corollary 5.4 ([35]) With G and K as in Theorem 5.3, there is a bijective
correspondence between the (natural unitary monoidal) isomorphism classes of
dimension-preserving unitary ﬁber functors Rep G ! Hilbf and those of Rep K.
Namely, the correspondence maps a functor Rep K ! Hilbf into its composition
with the forgetful functor Rep G ! Rep K.
In other words, the natural map H2. OKI T/ ! H2. OGI T/ induced by the inclusion
U .K/ ,! U .G/ is a bijection.
This corollary is of course void of any content when G is already of Kac type,
e.g., when G is a genuine compact group. In the latter case it is, however, still
possible to say something interesting about H2. OGI T/ by the theory developed by
Wassermann [54, 55] and Landstad [22]. We will say a few words about it later.
Now, let us return to abstract C-tensor categories and give another example of a
computation of the categorical Poisson boundary.
Recall that in Sect. 3.2 we introduced twistings .Rep G/ of Rep G by cocycles
 2 Z3.Ch.G/I T/. The same construction makes sense for arbitrary C : given a
cocycle  2 Z3.Ch.C /I T/, we deﬁne new associativity morphisms .U˝V/˝W !
U ˝ .V ˝ W/ as those of C multiplied by the factor .g; h; k/ if U, V and W have
the degrees g, h and k 2 Ch.C /, respectively, and denote the C-tensor category we
thus obtain by C .
The category OC is graded over Ch.C /, since if X and Y are objects in C of
different degrees, then there are no nonzero morphisms X ! Y in OC . It follows
that for any probability measure  on IrrC the Poisson boundary P.C I / is
still graded over Ch.C /. Therefore Ch.C / is a quotient of Ch.P.C I //, so any
cocycle  2 Z3.Ch.C /I T/ can be viewed as a cocycle on Ch.P.C I // and we can
consider the twisted category P.C I /. The functor ˘W C ! P.C I / deﬁnes a
tensor functor C  ! P.C I /, which we denote by ˘ . A natural question is
how .P.C I /; ˘ / is related to the Poisson boundary of .C ; /. We have the
following result.
Theorem 5.5 ([4]) Let C be a rigid C-tensor category with simple unit,  2
Z3.Ch.C /I T/, and  be an ergodic probability measure on Irr C . Then ˘ W C  !
P.C I / is a universal unitary tensor functor such that dP.C I/.˘ .X// D
kXk for all X 2 C , hence it is isomorphic to the Poisson boundary of .C ; /.
This theorem is proved in [4] for C D Rep G, but the general case is essentially
the same. See also [5] for a related result.
From this we obtain the following useful extension of Theorem 5.3.

Quantum Groups of Lie Type
6.1
Fiber Functors on Twisted Representation Categories
Let G be a compact connected semisimple Lie group and T  G be a maximal
torus. We denote the weight and root lattices of g by P and Q, respectively,
and denote by X.T/  P the weight lattice of T. We also denote by 	 D
.X.T/; ˘; X.T/; ˘ _/ a ﬁxed based root datum of .G; T/.
For any q > 0 we have canonical isomorphisms
Ch.Gq/ Š Ch.G/ Š1
Z.G/ Š X.T/=Q:
As described in Sect. 3.2, for every  2 Z3.1
Z.G/I T/ we can therefore consider a
new category .Rep Gq/ with associativity morphisms deﬁned by the action of .
Example 6.1 Let us give concrete examples of such cocycles . Assume Z.G/ is
isomorphic to a cyclic group Z=nZ (which happens, for example, when G is simple
and G 6Š Spin.4n/). Then any 3-cocycle on Ch.Gq/ Š Z=nZ is cohomologous to
the cocycle
.a; b; c/ D !
	
b aCb
n cb a
ncb b
nc

c
.a; b; c 2 Z=nZ/
for some n-th root of unity !.
The ﬁrst natural question is whether the categories .Rep Gq/ admit any ﬁber
functors.
Suppose that c 2 U .T  T/ is a T-valued 2-cochain on the dual group OT D
X.T/ such that its coboundary @c is invariant under Q in each variable. Then @c
can be considered a 3-cocycle ˚c on 1
Z.G/ and we obtain the twisted category
.Rep Gq/˚c D .Rep Gq; ˚c/ as above. Since ˚c is the coboundary of c over OT,
we have a unitary ﬁber functor FcW .Rep Gq; ˚c/ ! Hilbf which is identical to the
canonical ﬁber functor on Rep Gq, except that the tensor structure is given by
.Fc/2W HU ˝ HV ! HU

This functor deﬁnes a new compact quantum group Gc
q such that Rep Gc
q is
unitarily monoidally equivalent to .Rep Gq; ˚c/. Explicitly, similarly to the case
of twisting by 2-cocycles, CŒGc
q D CŒG as coalgebras, while the new -algebra
structure is deﬁned by duality from .U .Gq/; c Oq./c/. Because c is deﬁned on
OT, the coproduct of any element a 2 U .T/ computed in U .Gc
q/ is the same as
Oq.a/ D O.a/. In particular, T is still a closed subgroup of Gc
q.
Example 6.2 A concrete example of c can be given as follows [36]. Let r be the rank
of G, and let  D .1; : : : ; r/ 2 Z.G/r. Take any function cW X.T/  X.T/ ! T
satisfying
c.;  C Q/ D f.; /;
c. C ˛i; / D hi; ic.; /:
Then ˚c D @.c/ is Q-invariant in each variable and hence can be considered as a
3-cocycle on1
Z.G/. Moreover, any other choice of c only differs by a function on
.X.T/=Q/2 and deﬁnes exactly the same quantum group Gcq .
Let T be the subgroup of Z.G/ generated by the components of . Then the
algebra CŒGcq  can be presented as a subalgebra of CŒGq Ì OT, which can be used
to understand the irreducible representations and K-theory of C.Gcq / [36].
The construction of Gcq is a particular example of twisting by almost adjoint
invariant cocentral actions developed in [4].
As was already mentioned in Sect. 3.3, for q ¤ 1, the torus T is a maximal
quantum subgroup of Gq of Kac type. By Theorem 5.6 it follows that for any
 2 Z3.1
Z.G/I T/ the forgetful functor .Rep Gq/ ! .Rep T/ is a universal unitary
tensor functor deﬁning the classical dimension function on .Rep Gq/. This can be
used in two ways. On the one hand, applying this to  D ˚c we conclude that
H2. OGc
qI T/ Š H2. OTI T/:
(6.1)
In particular, the dimension-preserving ﬁber functors of Gc
q produce only quantum
groups of the form Gc0
q with c0c1 2 Z2. OTI T/. On the other hand, since it is easy
to understand when .Rep T/ admits a ﬁber functor, we conclude that .Rep Gq/
admits a dimension-preserving unitary tensor functor if and only if  lifts to a
coboundary on OT D X.T/. This leads to the following result.
Theorem 6.3 ([4, 36]) Let G be a compact connected semisimple Lie group with a
maximal torus T, and H be a compact quantum group of G-type with representation
category .Rep Gq/ for some q > 0, q ¤ 1, and  2 Z3.1
Z.G/I T/. Then
•
the cocycle  is cohomologous to a cocycle of the form ˚c constructed in
Example 6.2;
•
the quantum group H is isomorphic to Gc
q
for a cocycle  2 Z2. OTI T/.
In particular, although the construction in Example 6.2 may seem somewhat
ad hoc, the theorem shows that the only other way of constructing dimension-

252
S. Neshveyev and M. Yamashita
preserving unitary ﬁber functors on .Rep Gq/ is by multiplying the cochains c
in that example by 2-cocycles on OT.
Remark 6.4
1. Since the classical and quantum dimension functions on .Rep Gq/ coincide if
and only if q D 1, instead of requiring q ¤ 1 we could say that H is not of Kac
type.
2. Another way of formulating the above theorem is by saying that for q ¤ 1 the
quantum groups Gc
q
exhaust all quantum groups of G-type corresponding to the
classes Œ˚KZ;q 2 H3
G. OGI T/.
3. The cocycles  cohomologous to the cocycles of the form ˚c can be abstractly
characterized as those that vanish on ^3.X.T/=Q/  H3.X.T/=QI Z/ [36]. In
particular, when G is simple, then ^3.X.T/=Q/ D 0 and all cocycles satisfy this
property.
Isomorphism (6.1) and Theorem 6.3 fail miserably for q D 1. First of all, the
map H2. OTI T/ ! H2. OGI T/ maps the orbits under the action of the Weyl group into
single points. Therefore as soon as the rank of some simple factor of G is at least 2,
the map H2. OTI T/ ! H2. OGI T/ is not injective. More importantly, when the rank is
large enough, the map is very far from being surjective. In order to formulate the
precise result, let us introduce some terminology.
Let G be for a moment an arbitrary compact group. A cocycle x 2 Z2. OGI T/ is
called nondegenerate if its cohomology class does not arise from a proper closed
subgroup of G. Denote by H2. OGI T/ the (possibly empty) subset of H2. OGI T/
consisting of classes represented by nondegenerate cocycles. The following result
is essentially due to Wassermann [54, 55], although the formulation is rather taken
from [30]. For ﬁnite groups and without the unitarity condition similar results were
also obtained in [12, 13, 26].
Theorem 6.5 For any compact group G we have a decomposition
H2. OGI T/ Š
G
ŒK
H2. OKI T/=NG.K/;
where the union is taken over the conjugacy classes of closed subgroups K of G and
NG.K/ denotes the normalizer of K in G, which acts through the adjoint action on
H2. OKI T/.
It can further be shown that a cocycle x 2 Z2. OKI T/ is nondegenerate if and
only if the corresponding K-C-algebra B, as described in Sect. 4, is simple (as a
C-algebra) [22, 54]. When K is ﬁnite, the structure of such K-C-algebras is easy
to understand: B must be a full matrix algebra End.H/, and by bijectivity of the
Galois map (4.3) its dimension has to be jKj, so the action of K must be given by an
irreducible projective representation K ! PU.H/ of dimension dim H D jKj1=2.
Now, given a compact connected Lie group G with a maximal torus T, if G
contains a non-abelian ﬁnite subgroup K admitting such a projective representation,

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum Groups of Lie Type
253
the corresponding class in H2. OGI T/ does not lie in the image of H2. OTI T/.
Furthermore, as there can be a lot of such nonconjugate subgroups K, the above
theorem suggests that we should not expect a simple parametrization of Kac
quantum groups of G-type similar to Theorem 6.3, in particular, those that have
representation category Rep G.
6.2
Isomorphism Problem for Twisted q-Deformations
In this last section we consider the problem of classifying the quantum groups Gc
q
up to isomorphism. Since we have already classiﬁed the dimension-preserving
unitary ﬁber functors on Rep Gc
q (for q ¤ 1), for this we have to understand
unitary monoidal equivalences between these categories, and in particular, their
autoequivalences.
We start with autoequivalences that preserve the isomorphism classes of objects.
It is not difﬁcult to see that the group of such autoequivalencesof .Rep Gq/ does not
depend on  [35]. Therefore these autoequivalences are described by the following
result.
Theorem 6.6 ([30, 31]) For any q > 0 and any compact connected semisimple Lie
group G, we have a group isomorphism
H2.1
Z.G/I T/ Š H2
Gq. OGqI T/
induced by the inclusion U .Z.G// ,! U .Gq/.
In view of (6.1) the result is not surprising, at least for q ¤ 1. The proof, however,
relies on different ideas and is more constructive than that of (6.1). The main part
of it shows that if x 2 Z2
Gq. OGqI T/ is an invariant cocycle with the property that for
any highest weight representations U and U
 it acts trivially via the representation
U 
> U
 on the vectors of weights  C 
 and  C 
  ˛i for all simple roots ˛i, then
x D 1.
Assume now that we have a unitary monoidal equivalence between .Rep Gq/1
and .Rep Gq/2. It deﬁnes an automorphism of the representation semiring RC.G/.
Such an automorphism must arise from an automorphism  of the based root
datum 	 of G [24]. The automorphism  can then be lifted to an automorphism
of Gq, which has to map the class of 1 in H3
Gq. OGqI T/ into that of 2. At least for
simple Lie groups it is not difﬁcult to understand when this happens.
Proposition 6.7 ([21, 35]) For any q > 0 and any compact connected simple
Lie group G, the canonical map H3.1
Z.G/I T/ ! H3
Gq. OGqI T/ is injective , or
equivalently, the map
H3.1
Z.G/I T/ ! H3
G. OGI T/; Œ 7! Œ˚KZ;q;

254
S. Neshveyev and M. Yamashita
is injective. Furthermore, unless G Š Spin.4n/, the group Aut.	/ acts trivially on
H3.1
Z.G/I T/.
The result is proved in [21] for G D SU.n/. The proof for other simple groups is
similar. The idea is that if U is an irreducible representation of Gq and fW 1 ! U
>k
is an isometric morphism which up to a phase factor can be described entirely in
terms of the fusion rules, then the composition
U
f˝  .U 
> U
>.k1// 
> U

 U 
> .U
>.k1/ 
> U/
˝f 
 U
in .Rep Gq/ is a scalar which, on the one hand, depends only on the class of 
in H3
Gq. OGqI T/ and, on the other hand, can be explicitly computed in terms of .
It should be remarked that the proposition, as well as several other results in this
section, is formulated in [35] for simply connected groups. But the proofs for their
quotients are only easier. For example, the center of Spin.4n/ is Z=2Z ˚ Z=2Z and
in the above argument several different representations U are needed to recover the
class of . But the center of any proper quotient of Spin.4n/ is cyclic and it sufﬁces
to take only one U, namely, either the standard representation of SOq.4n/ or one of
the spin representations.
Returning to classiﬁcation of the quantum groups Gc
q, we see that, at least for
simple G, unitary monoidal equivalences between their representation categories
arise only from automorphisms of the root datum and from 2-cocycles on the dual
of the center. Together with the classiﬁcation of dimension-preserving ﬁber functors
on Rep Gc
q given by (6.1), this leads to the following result.
Theorem 6.8 ([35]) Let G be a compact connected simple Lie group with a
maximal torus T, q1; q2 2 .0; 1/, and c1; c2 be T-valued 2-cochains on X.T/
such that @c1; @c2 descend to X.T/=Q. Then the quantum groups Gc1
q1 and Gc2
q2 are
isomorphic if and only if q1 D q2 and there exist an element  2 Aut.	/ and
a T-valued 2-cochain b on X.T/=Q such that c1.c2/1b1 is a coboundary on
X.T/.
If we knew that the categories .Rep Gq/ exhausted all rigid C-tensor categories
with fusion rules of G, then the above theorem together with Theorem 6.3 would
give a classiﬁcation of all non-Kac compact quantum groups of G-type, giving a
partial solution of Problem 3.3. For G D SU.n/ this is known to be the case [18, 21]
(see also [42, 44] for related slightly weaker results). Furthermore, in this case
the algebras CŒSUc
q.n/ can be explicitly described in terms of generators and
relations [35].
Remark 6.9 There are indications that a complete classiﬁcation of non-Kac com-
pact quantum groups of G-type should be possible beyond the case of G D SU.n/.
Speciﬁcally, in the framework of rigid semisimple C-linear tensor categories, there
are several recent classiﬁcation results showing that such tensor categories with
fusion rules of G are exhausted by Rep Gq, with q 2 C not a nontrivial root of

Towards a Classiﬁcation of Compact Quantum Groups of Lie Type
255
unity. For example, the case of G D PSp.4/ is known by [6], and the case of the
smallest exceptional group G D G2 has been recently settled in [25]. For these cases
it only remains to show the uniqueness of the compatible C-structures when q is a
positive real number.

A Homology Theory for Smale
Spaces: A Summary
Ian F. Putnam
Abstract We consider Smale spaces, a particular class of hyperbolic topological
dynamical systems, which include the basic sets for Smale’s Axiom A systems.
We present an algebraic invariant for such systems which is based on Krieger’s
dimension group for the special case of shifts of ﬁnite type. This theory provides
a Lefschetz formula relating trace data with the number of periodic points of
the system, answering a question posed by R. Bowen. The key ingredient is the
existence of Markov partitions with special properties.
1
Introduction
Smale introduced the notion of an Axiom A diffeomorphism of a compact manifold
[16]. For such a system, a basic set is a closed invariant subset of the non-wandering
set which is irreducible in a certain sense. One of Smale’s key observations was that
such a set need not be a submanifold. Typically, it is some type of fractal object.
The Artin-Masur zeta function encodes the data of the periodic points for a
dynamical system. Manning proved that, for any basic set of an Axiom A system,
the associated Artin-Masur zeta function is rational. This led Bowen to conjecture
the existence of a homology theory for such systems which had a Lefschetz-type
theorem. Such a theory would immediately imply Manning’s rationality result. Such
a theory is given in [14]. The aim of this article is to give a short summary of this
theory without proofs.
The theory takes, as its starting point, the notion of the dimension group of a shift
of ﬁnite type introduced by Krieger [9] and the fundamental result of Bowen [2] that
every basic set is a factor of a shift of ﬁnite type.
In an effort to give a purely topological (i.e. without reference to any smooth
structure) description of the dynamics on a basic set, Ruelle introduced the notion
of a Smale space [15]: a Smale space is a compact metric space, .X; d/, and a
homeomorphism, ', of X, which possesses canonical coordinates of contracting

and expanding directions. The precise deﬁnition involves the existence of a map
Œ;  giving canonical coordinates. Here, we review only the features necessary for
the statements of our results.
There is a constant X > 0 and, for each x in X and 0 <   X, there are
sets Xs.x; / and Xu.x; /, called the local stable and unstable sets, respectively,
whose product is homeomorphic to a neighbourhood of x. As  varies, these form a
neighbourhood base at x. Moreover, there is a constant 0 <  < 1 such that
d.'.y/; '.z//  d.y; z/; y; z 2 Xs.x; X/
d.'1.y/; '1.z//  d.y; z/; y; z 2 Xu.x; X/
The bracket Œx; y is the unique point in the intersection of Xs.x; X/ and Xu.y; X/.
We say that .X; '/ is non-wandering if every point of X is non-wandering for ' [8].
Stable and unstable equivalence relations are deﬁned by
Rs D f.x; y/ j
lim
n!C1 d.'n.x/; 'n.y// D 0g
Ru D f.x; y/ j
lim
n!C1 d.'n.x/; 'n.y// D 0g:
We let Xs.x/ and Xu.x/ denote the stable and unstable equivalence classes of x in X.
These subsets are typically not locally compact in the relative topology. However,
there are natural, much nicer topologies, which are given by using the families
Xs.x0; /; x0 2 Xs.x/; 0 <  < X and Xu.x0; /; x0 2 Xu.x/; 0 <  < X, respectively,
as bases.
The main examples of such systems are shifts of ﬁnite type (of which we will say
more in a moment), hyperbolic toral automorphisms, solenoids, substitution tiling
spaces (under some hypotheses) and, most importantly, the basic sets for Smale’s
Axiom A systems [3, 16].
Let .Y;  / and .X; '/ be Smale spaces. A factor map from .Y;  / to .X; '/ is a
function  W Y ! X which is continuous, surjective and satisﬁes  ı  D ' ı .
It is clear that, for any y in Y, .Ys.y//  Xs..y// and .Yu.y//  Xu..y//.
David Fried [7] deﬁned  to be s-resolving (or u-resolving) if, for every y in Y, the
restriction of  to Ys.y/ (or to Yu.y/, respectively) is injective. We say that  is s-
bijective (or u-bijective) if, for every y in Y,  is a bijection from Ys.y/ to Xs..y//
(or from Yu.y/ to Xu..y//, respectively). This actually implies that  is a local
homeomorphism from the local stable sets (or unstable sets, respectively) in Y to
those in X. In the case that .X; '/ is non-wandering, s-resolving (u-resolving) and
s-bijective (u-bijective, respectively) are equivalent.

Shifts of Finite Type
Shifts of ﬁnite type are described in detail in [10]. We consider a ﬁnite directed
graph G. This consists of a ﬁnite vertex set G0, a ﬁnite edge set G1 and maps i; t (for
initial and terminal) from G1 to G0. The associated shift space
˙G D fe D .ek/k2Z j ek 2 G1; t.ek/ D i.ekC1/; k 2 Zg
(2.1)
consists of all bi-inﬁnite paths in G, speciﬁed as an edge list. The map  is the
left shift on ˙G deﬁned by .e/k D ekC1, for all e in ˙G and k in Z. By a shift
of ﬁnite type, we mean any system topologically conjugate to .˙G; /, for some
graph G. This is not the usual deﬁnition, but is equivalent to it (see Theorem 2.3.2
of [10]). For e in ˙G, we deﬁne eŒK;L D .eK; : : : :eL/, for all integers K  L and also
eŒKC1;K D t.eK/, for convenience. We then use the metric
d.e; f/ D inff1; 2N1 j eŒ1N;N D f Œ1N;N; N  0g;
for e; f in ˙G. We observe that such systems are Smale spaces by noting that the
bracket operation is deﬁned, with X D 1=2, as follows. For e; f in ˙G, Œe; f is
deﬁned if t.e0/ D t. f 0/ and then it is the sequence, .: : : ; f 1; f 0; e1; e2; : : :/. For any
l  1 and e0 in ˙G, the local stable and unstable sets are given by
˙s
G.e0; 2l/ D fe 2 ˙ j ek D ek
0; k  lg;
˙u
G.e0; 2l/ D fe 2 ˙ j ek D ek
0; k  lg:
It is a simple matter to see the constant  D 1=2 will satisfy the axioms.
Theorem 2.1 Shifts of ﬁnite type are exactly the zero-dimensional (i.e. totally
disconnected) Smale spaces.
The fundamental rôle of shifts of ﬁnite type is demonstrated by the following
universal property, due to Bowen [2]. This builds on earlier results by many others,
including Adler and Weiss and Sinai.
Theorem 2.2 (Bowen)
Let .X; '/ be a non-wandering Smale space. Then there
exists a non-wandering shift of ﬁnite type .˙; / and a ﬁnite-to-one factor map
 W .˙; / ! .X; '/:

Krieger’s Dimension Group Invariant
Krieger [9] deﬁned the past and future dimension groups of a shift of ﬁnite, .˙; /,
as follows. Consider Ds.˙; / to be the collection of compact, open subsets of
˙s.e; /, as e varies over ˙ and 0 <   ˙. We let  denote the smallest
equivalence relation on Ds.˙; / such that
1. If E; F are in Ds.˙; / with ŒE; F D F and ŒF; E D E (meaning both are
deﬁned), then E  F,
2. If E; F; '.E/ and '.F/ are all in Ds.˙; /, then E  F if and only if '.E/ 
'.F/.
As an example, it is a simple matter to check that for any e0; f0 and integer l  1,
the sets ˙s
G.e0; 2l/ and ˙s
G. f0; 2l/ (as described just prior to Theorem 2.2) are
equivalent if i.el
0 / D i. f l
0 /.
We generate a free abelian group on the equivalence classes of elements, E, of
Ds.˙; / (denoted ŒE) subject to the additional relation that ŒE [ F D ŒE C ŒF,
if E [ F is in Ds.˙; / and E and F are disjoint. The result is denoted by Ds.˙; /.
There is an analogous deﬁnition of Du.˙; /.
Theorem 3.1 (Krieger [9]) Let G be a ﬁnite directed graph and .˙G; / be the
associated shift of ﬁnite type. Then Ds.˙G; / (or Du.˙G; /, respectively) is
isomorphic to the inductive limit of the sequence
ZG0 s
! ZG0 s
!   
where ZG0 denotes the free abelian group on the vertex set G0 and the map s.v/ D
P
t.e/Dv i.e/, for any v in G0 (or respectively, replacing s by u, whose deﬁnition
is the same, interchanging the rôles of i and t).
The ﬁrst crucial result for the development of our theory is the following
functorial property of Ds and Du, which can be found in [4].
Theorem 3.2 Let .˙; / and .˙0; / be shifts of ﬁnite type and let
 W .˙; / ! .˙0; / be a factor map.
1. If  is s-bijective, then there are natural homomorphisms
s W Ds.˙; / ! Ds.˙0; /;
u W Du.˙0; / ! Du.˙; /:
2. If  is u-bijective, then there are natural homomorphisms
u W Du.˙; / ! Du.˙0; /;
s W Ds.˙0; / ! Ds.˙; /:

Smale Space Homology
263
The idea is simple enough: in the covariant case, the induced map sends the class
of a set E in Ds.˙; / to the class of .E/, while in the contravariant case, the map
sends the class of E0 in Ds.˙0; / to the class of 1.E0/. The latter is not correct
since 1.E0/ may not even be contained in a single stable equivalence class, but it
sufﬁces that it may be written as a ﬁnite union of elements of Ds.˙; /. These ideas
can be made precise under the stated hypotheses.

s=u-Bijective Pairs
The key ingredient in our construction is the following notion.
Deﬁnition 4.1 Let .X; '/ be a Smale space. An s=u-bijective pair, , for .X; '/
consists of Smale spaces .Y;  / and .Z; / and factor maps
s W .Y;  / ! .X; '/;
u W .Z; / ! .X; '/
such that
1. Yu.y; / is totally disconnected, for all y in Y and 0 <   Y,
2. s is s-bijective,
3. Zs.z; / is totally disconnected, for all z in Z and 0 <   Z,
4. u is u-bijective.
To summarize the idea in an informal way, the space Y is an extension of X,
where the local unstable sets are totally disconnected, while the local stable sets
are homeomorphic to those in X. The existence of such s=u-bijective pairs, at least
for non-wandering .X; '/, can be deduced from the results of [13] or [6]. It can be
viewed as a coordinate-wise version of Bowen’s theorem.
If .Y;  ; u; Z; ; s/ is an s=u-bijective pair for .X; '/, then we form the ﬁbred
product ˙./ D f.y; z/ 2 Y  Z j s.y/ D u.z/g with the map  D   j˙./
and the two canonical projections u W ˙./ ! Y and s W ˙./ ! Z. It is an easy
matter to check that the former is u-bijective while the latter is s-bijective. It follows
that both local stable and local unstable sets in ˙./ are totally disconnected and,
hence, that .˙./; / is a shift of ﬁnite type. Thus, we recover Bowen’s result 2.2
with the additional condition that  may be factored as  D s ı u D u ı s, with
maps with the additional properties described. We remark that it is not true that an
arbitrary map  as in Theorem 2.2 has such a decomposition.
Theorem 4.2 If .X; '/ is non-wandering, then there exists an s=u-bijective pair for
.X; '/.

264
I.F. Putnam
Deﬁnition 4.3 Let  D .Y;  ; u; Z; ; s/ be an s=u-bijective pair for
.X; '/. For each L; M  0, we deﬁne
˙L;M./ D f.y0; : : : ; yL; z0; : : : ; zM/ j yl 2 Y; zm 2 Z;
s.yl/ D u.zm/; 0  l  L; 0  m  Mg
For simplicity, we also denote ˙0;0./ by ˙./.
We deﬁne L;M W ˙L;M./ ! ˙L;M./ by
L;M.y0; : : : ; yL; z0; : : : ; zM/ D . .y0/; : : : ;  .yL/; .z0/; : : : ; .zM//:
For L  1 and 0  l  L, we let ıl; W ˙L;M./ ! ˙L1;M./ be the map which
deletes entry yl. Similarly, the map ı;m W ˙L;M./ ! ˙L;M1./ deletes entry zm,
for M  1; 0  m  M.
The important properties of these systems and maps is summarized as follows.
Theorem 4.4
1. For every L; M  0, .˙L;M./; L;M/ is a shift of ﬁnite type.
2. For L  1, 0  l  L, the map ıl; is an s-bijective factor map.
3. For M  1, 0  m  M, the map ı;m is a u-bijective factor map.

Homology
There are actually two homology theories here. One, based on the dimension group
Ds will be denoted by Hs
 and the other, based on Du, will be denoted by Hu
. We
will concentrate on the former for the remainder of this note.
It is worth noting that, if .X; '/ is a Smale space, then so is .X; '1/, although
’stable’ in the former is the same as ‘unstable’ in the latter. Following this idea
carefully through the theory, one can check that Hu.X; '/ is naturally isomorphic to
Hs.X; '1/.
Let .X; '/ be a Smale space and suppose that
 D .Y;  ; s; Z; ; u/ is an s=u-bijective pair for .X; '/. By applying Krieger’s
invariant to each of the shifts of ﬁnite type, ˙L;M./, and the maps between them
induced by the maps ıl;; ı;m; 0  l  L; 0  m  M, one obtains a double complex.
In a standard way, we can take the homology of this double complex as follows.
We deﬁne
Cs./N D
M
LMDN
Ds.˙L;M./; L;M/

Smale Space Homology

;m:
where, in the special case L D 0, we set ıs
0; D 0.
Unfortunately, this complex is rather large and we will replace it with others that
are more manageable. In more technical terms, the fact that Krieger’s invariant is
covariant for the maps ıl; but contravariant for the maps ı;m mean that the double
complex is a ‘second quadrant’ double complex, despite our choice of indexing
L; M  0. In simplicial homology, there are two complexes which may be used.
One is called the ordered complex (which is analogous to one which we have
above) and the second is called the alternating complex. In the former, the N-
chains are constructed from N C 1-tuples of vertices, all in a single simplex. In the
latter, the N-chains are constructed from the N-simplices. The difference is that the
former allows for repetition of vertices (i.e. degenerate simplices) and distinguishes
between permutations of the vertices. The latter does not consider the order, except
for orientation.
In our case, we have actions of the group permutation group SLC1  SMC1
on .˙L;M./; L;M/ and hence on the invariant Ds.˙L;M./; L;M/. We write
these actions on the right. We form Ds
Q;.˙L;M./; L;M/ which the quotient of
Ds.˙L;M./; L;M/ by the subgroup of all elements which are ﬁxed under some
transposition and all elements of the form a  sgn.˛/a  .˛; 1/, where ˛ is in SLC1.
We also form a subgroup Ds
;A .˙L;M./; L;M/ of Ds.˙L;M./; L;M/ consisting of
those elements a such that a  .1; ˇ/ D sgn.ˇ/a, for all ˇ in SMC1. Finally, we form
a subgroup of the former, also a quotient of the latter, Ds
Q;A .˙L;M./; L;M/, which
incorporates the action of SLC1  SMC1. We deﬁne complexes .Cs
Q;./; ds
Q;.//,
.Cs
;A ./; ds
;A .// and .Cs
Q;A ./; ds
Q;A .// using these groups instead.
The most obvious advantage of these new complexes is the following. Each s-
bijective or u-bijective factor map is ﬁnite-to-one. Indeed, there are constants L0
and M0 such that
#1
s fxg  L0; #1
u fxg  M0
for all x in X. It follows that Ds
Q;.˙L;M./; L;M/ D 0 if L  L0,
Ds
;A .˙L;M./; L;M/ D 0 if M  M0 and Ds
Q;A .˙L;M./; L;M/ D 0 if either
L  L0 or M  M0.
Standard techniques in homological algebra yield the following.

I.F. Putnam
Theorem 5.1 Let  be an s=u-bijective pair for the Smale space .X; '/. We have a
commutative diagram of chain complexes and chain maps as shown:
Moreover, the maps QA and JQ both induce isomorphisms on homology.
So the three new complexes all have the same homology. It seems likely that
the original complex also has the same homology, but this does not seem to follow
easily from standard techniques.
Deﬁnition 5.2 Let .X; '/ be a Smale space and  be an s=u-bijective pair for
.X; '/. We deﬁne Hs./ to be the homology of the complex .Cs
Q;A ./; ds
Q;A .//.
There is an analogous deﬁnition of Hu./.
We remark that the deﬁnition is valid for any Smale space which has an s=u-
bijective pair, which includes all non-wandering Smale spaces.
6
Properties
We want to establish some basic properties of our theory. The ﬁrst crucial result is
the following. It is stated in a slightly informal manner, but one which conveys the
main idea.
Theorem 6.1 Let .X; '/ be a Smale space and  be an s=u-bijective pair for .X; '/.
Hs
./ is independent of the s=u-bijective pair
 D .Y;  ; s; Z; ; u/ and depends only on .X; '/.
Henceforth, we denote Hs
./ by Hs
.X; '/ instead.
Theorem 6.2 The homology theory Hs
 is functorial in the following sense. If
 W .X; '/ ! .X0; '0/ is an s-bijective factor map, then there are induced group
homomorphisms
s W Hs
N.X; '/ ! Hs
N.X0; '0/;
for all N in Z. If the map  is a u-bijective factor, then there are induced group
homomorphisms
s W Hs
N.X0; '0/ ! Hs
N.X; '/;
for all N in Z.

Smale Space Homology
267
The following is an easy consequence of our earlier observation that
Ds
Q;A .˙L;M./; L;M/ is non-zero for only ﬁnitely many values of L and M and the
fact that Krieger’s invariant is always a ﬁnite rank abelian group.
Theorem 6.3 For any Smale space .X; '/ which has an s=u-bijective pair, the
groups Hs
N.X; '/ are ﬁnite rank and are non-zero for only ﬁnite many values of N.
Finally, we have the following analogue of the Lefschetz formula. Given .X; '/,
we can regard '1 as a factor map from this system to itself. It is both s-bijective
and u-bijective and so, by Theorem 6.2, induces an automorphism of our invariant,
denoted .'1/s. The proof of the following result, already known in the case of
shifts of ﬁnite type, uses ideas of Manning [11].

Examples
We present four examples where the computations above may be carried out
quite explicitly. All of the examples are computed using the double complex
.Cs
Q;A ./; ds
Q;A .//.
Example 7.1 Suppose .˙; / is a shift of ﬁnite type. In this case, an s=u-bijective
pair is just .Y;  / D .Z; / D .˙; /. Only the 0; 0-term in the double complex is
non-zero and it is just Ds.˙; /. Hence, Hs
N.˙; / is just Ds.˙; /, for N D 0, and
zero otherwise.
Example 7.2 For m  2, let .X; '/ be the m1-solenoid. More speciﬁcally, we let
X D f.z0; z1; : : :/ j zn 2 T; zn D zm
nC1; n  0g;
with the map
'.z0; z1; : : :/ D .zm
0 ; zm
1 ; zm
2 ; : : :/;
for .z0; z1; : : :/ in X. In this case, there is an s-bijective factor map onto .X; '/ from
the full m-shift (i.e. G is the graph with one vertex and m edges). The simplest s=u-
bijective pair here is .Y;  / D .˙G; / and .Z; / D .X; '/. The only non-zero
groups in the double complex occur for .L; M/ equal to .0; 0/ and .1; 0/ and these
are ZŒm1 and Z, respectively. The boundary maps are all zero (only one needs to
be computed) and Hs
N.X; '/ is isomorphic to ZŒm1, for N D 0, Z, for N D 1 and
zero for all other N.

Concluding Remarks
Remark 8.1 It is certainly a natural question to ask whether this theory can be
computed from other (already existing) machinery. A more speciﬁc question would
be to relate our homology to, say, the Cech cohomology of the classifying space of
the topological equivalence relation Rs. (For a discussion of the topology, see [12].)

Smale Space Homology
269
There are examples, such as the ﬁrst three above, where they are different, but only
up to a dimension shift (depending on the space under consideration).
Remark 8.2 An important motivation in the construction of this theory was to
compute the K-theory of certain C-algebras associated with the Smale space
.X; '/. See [12] for a discussion of these C-algebras. At present, there seems to
be a spectral sequence which relates the two; this work is still in progress.

On the Positive Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
of a Non-negative Matrix
Klaus Thomsen
Abstract The paper develops the version of the classical Perron-Frobenius theory
which is appropriate for the study of KMS weights of generalized gauge actions on
simple graph C-algebras.

Introduction
Recent work on KMS states and weights on graph C-algebras has uncovered an
intimate relation to positive eigenvalues and eigenvectors for non-negative matrices
naturally associated to the graph and the one-parameter action. Speciﬁcally, for
the gauge action on a graph C-algebra there is a non-negative matrix B over
the vertexes V in the graph, such that KMS weights corresponding to the inverse
temperature ˇ 2 R are in bijective correspondence with the non-zero non-negative
vectors  with the properties that
X

(1.1)
for all vertexes v, and
X
w2V
Bvww D eˇv
(1.2)
when v is not a sink and does not emit inﬁnitely many edges. If a state, rather than
a weight is sought for, one should in addition insist that P
v v D 1. The same kind
of equations, but with different matrices determine also the gauge invariant KMS
weights and states for more general actions on graph C-algebras. See [2, 4, 8].
Finding the solutions to (1.1) and (1.2) is in general a highly non-trivial task.
The literature on positive eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a non-negative matrix
is enormous, and for ﬁnite graphs there are in fact results available that can be

used to determine the possible values of ˇ and for each ˇ get a description of
the corresponding vectors , albeit with some additional work, cf. [3]. For inﬁnite
matrices this is no longer the case—very far from. The most fundamental questions
prompted by the connection to KMS states and weights are those that I guess come
to the mind of any mathematician:
(a) For which ˇ are there non-zero non-negative solutions to the equations ?
(b) How does the structure of the solutions vary with ˇ ?
From the theory of countable state Markov chains it is known that these questions
are often extremely hard to answer already when the matrix is irreducible and
stochastic, but also that the structure of the solutions can be very rich and interesting.
The concern here is that a general setting for an approach to the above problem
is missing, although the theory of harmonic and super-harmonic functions of
countable state Markov chains comes close. It is the purpose with the present paper
to provide a framework for the work on the problem when the graph C-algebra
is simple, or more precisely when the graph is coﬁnal. As far as I know, no one
has developed the theory in this setting. It involves a possibly inﬁnite matrix B as
above for which the underlying directed graph need not be strongly connected, and
what is sought are neither exactly the harmonic functions of eˇB nor exactly the
super-harmonic functions. But it is something in between and the coﬁnality of the
associated graph is a property which can substitute for the often assumed strong
connectivity. What I show is how the known methods, which typically deal with
harmonic or super-harmonic functions (or vectors) of a non-negative matrix, often
stochastic or sub-stochastic for which the underlying digraph is strongly connected,
can be modiﬁed to the yield the desired framework. As a consequence the paper
is expository because the ideas I present are known. The purpose is to show how
the tools must be arranged in order to address the problem above. When the graph is
strongly connected with ﬁnite out-degree at every vertex, everything I present can be
obtained from the theory of countable state Markov chains in combination with the
work of Vere-Jones, [9], although the translation may not be straightforward. In the
more general coﬁnal case, and in the presence of inﬁnite emitters, some non-trivial
adjustments to the methods developed for Markov chains must be performed, and
rather than describing ﬁrst the Markov chain results and then the adjustments, I have
chosen to give a self-contained account, requiring no knowledge of Markov chains
or random walks. I make no claim of originality for the underlying ideas, but I hope
that the presentation will be useful for mathematicians interested in KMS weights
and states on C-algebras. Needless to say, I would be happy if workers from other
ﬁelds of mathematics also ﬁnd it worthwhile. I have kept the list of references to
an absolute minimum by quoting only my own sources. The reason for this is that
I am unable to point to the original sources of the ideas presented, not for lack of
good will, but out of ignorance. I therefore choose to follow the principle ‘none
mentioned, none forgotten’. I apologise to anyone offended by this.
Once the right setup is in place it is easy to begin to harvest results from the theory
of Markov chains. As an illustration of this I use in the ﬁnal section the theorem
on convergence to the boundary for a countable state Markov chain to obtain the

The Setting
Let V be a countable set and
V  V 3 .v; w/ 7! Avw 2 Œ0; 1/
a non-negative matrix A over V. We can then consider the directed graph G with
vertexes V such that there is an arrow from v 2 V to w 2 V if and only if Avw ¤
0. Let E denote the set of edges (or arrows) in G. When  is an edge, or more
generally a ﬁnite path in G, we denote by s./ and r./ its initial and terminal
vertex, respectively. Let V1 denote the union of the sinks and the inﬁnite emitters
in V, i.e.
V1 D ˚v 2 V W #s1.v/ 2 f0; 1g  :
A subset H 
 V is hereditary when e 2 E; s.e/ 2 H ) r.e/ 2 H, and saturated
when
v 2 VnV1; r.s1.v// 
 H ) v 2 H:
We assume that A is coﬁnal in the sense that V does not contain any subsets that are
both hereditary and saturated other than ; and V.
Lemma 2.1 Assume that A is coﬁnal. Let e1e2e3    be an inﬁnite path in G. For
every v 2 V there is an i 2 N and a ﬁnite path  in G such that s./ D v and
r./ D s.ei/.
Proof The set of vertexes v which do not have the stated property is hereditary and
saturated, and it is not all of V since it does not contain s.e1/. It must therefore be
empty.
ut
A vertex v 2 V is non-wandering when there is a ﬁnite path  in G such that
v D s./ D r./. We denote by NW the set of non-wandering vertexes in V.
The non-wandering subgraph of G is the subgraph GNW consisting of the vertexes
NW and the edges emitted from any of its elements. It follows that GNW is strongly
connected in the sense that for any pair v; w 2 NW there is a ﬁnite path  in G such
that s./ D v and r./ D w:
Lemma 2.2 NW is a (possibly empty) hereditary subset of V and the graph GNW is
strongly connected.

274
K. Thomsen
Proof When v 2 NW there is an inﬁnite path in G which visits v inﬁnitely often.
So when e 2 E and s.e/ 2 NW the coﬁnality of G ensures that there is a path  in
G connecting r.e/ to s.e/ by Lemma 2.1. Then e is a loop in G containing r.e/,
proving that r.e/ 2 NW, and hence that NW is hereditary. The proof that GNW is
strongly connected is similar.

Let ˇ 2 R. We are here looking for maps (or vectors)  W V ! Œ0; 1/ such that

(2.1)

X

for v 2 V1. We say then that  is almost ˇ-harmonic for A. When (2.1) holds for
all v 2 V, and not only for v 2 VnV1, we say that  is ˇ-harmonic for A.
Lemma 2.3 Let H be a non-empty hereditary subset of V and 
 W H ! Œ0; 1/ a
function such that (2.1) holds for all v 2 HnV1 and (2.2) holds for all v 2 H \V1.
There is a unique almost ˇ-harmonic vector  such that v D 
v for all v 2 H.
Proof Set
H1 D fv 2 VnV1 W Avw ¤ 0 ) w 2 Hg [ H:
Then H1 is hereditary, contains H and there is a unique extension of

the condition that eˇ

we get a sequence H

    of subsets of V and a unique extension
 of 
 to S
n Hn. This completes the proof since S
n Hn is hereditary and saturated,
and hence equal to V.
ut
Lemma 2.4 Assume that G contains a sink (i.e. A contains a zero row). It follows
that for all ˇ 2 R there is a non-zero almost ˇ-harmonic vector, unique up to
multiplication by constants.
Proof Note that a sink s constitutes a hereditary subset in itself. It follows therefore
from Lemma 2.3 that an almost ˇ-harmonic vector is determined by its value at s.
To show that there exists a non-zero almost ˇ-harmonic vector, set 
s D 1 and apply
Lemma 2.3.
ut
Lemma 2.5 Let  be a non-zero almost ˇ-harmonic vector. It follows that v > 0
for all v 2 V.
Proof The set fv 2 V W v D 0g is hereditary and saturated. Since  is not zero the
set is not all of V, and it must therefore be empty.

Lemma 2.6 Assume that there is a non-zero almost ˇ-harmonic vector for A. It
follows that An
vw < 1 for all n 2 N and all v; w 2 V.
In the rest of the paper we therefore assume that all powers of A are ﬁnite. Since
Lemma 2.4 contains all the information we seek when there is a sink present, there is
also nothing lost by assuming that there are no sinks in G. To summarise we assume
in the rest of the paper that
i) G is coﬁnal,
ii) that there are no sinks in G (equivalently, there are no zero rows in A), and
iii) that An
vw < 1 for all n 2 N and all v; w 2 V.
In particular, from now on V1 consists of the inﬁnite emitters in G, correspond-
ing to rows in A with inﬁnitely many non-zero entries.
Lemma 2.7 No vertex v 2 VnNW is an inﬁnite emitter, i.e. V1

Proof Let v 2 V be an inﬁnite emitter. Set
A D fw 2 V W there is a ﬁnite path  in G such that w D s./ and r./ D vg[fvg:

The Recurrent Case
In this section we consider the case where NW ¤ ; and where

(3.1)
for one and hence all v 2 NW. We say that A is recurrent in this case. The main
result will be the following theorem. In the irreducible case, i.e. when G is strongly
connected, it is contained in Corollary 2 on page 371 in [9].
Theorem 3.1 Assume that A is recurrent. There is a non-zero almost ˇ0-harmonic
vector which is unique up to multiplication by scalars, and it is ˇ0-harmonic for A.
The proof will require some preparations, some of which will also play a role in
the following sections. Let ˇ  ˇ0. If the sum
1
X

An
uuenˇ
(3.2)
is ﬁnite for some u 2 NW, it will be ﬁnite for all u 2 NW because GNW is strongly
connected by Lemma 2.2. Since
(
v 2 V W

is hereditary and saturated, we conclude that if the sum (3.2) is ﬁnite for some
u 2 NW, the sums

(3.3)
where v 2 V; u 2 NW, will all be ﬁnite. Since V1 
 NW by Lemma 2.7, it follows
that the sums (3.3) are all ﬁnite when v 2 V and u 2 V1, provided the sum (3.2) is
ﬁnite for one (and hence all) u 2 NW.

We say that a non-negative function k W V1 ! Œ0; 1/ is ˇ-summable when (3.4)
holds. When V1 is a ﬁnite set and k ¤ 0, this condition is equivalent to the ﬁniteness
of the sum (3.2) for any u 2 NW.
Lemma 3.3 (Riesz Decomposition) Let  an almost ˇ-harmonic vector. There is
a unique pair ; k, where  is a ˇ-harmonic vector and k W V1 ! Œ0; 1/ is ˇ-
summable, such that

strongly connected by Lemma 2.2. As NW is also hereditary by the same lemma, it

When NW Is Finite
By deﬁnition of the graph G there is at most one directed edge from one vertex to
another. So when NW is ﬁnite there are no inﬁnite emitters in NW and hence no
inﬁnite emitters at all by Lemma 2.7. In particular, all almost ˇ-harmonic vectors
are ˇ-harmonic.

Lemma 3.7 Assume that NW is non-empty but ﬁnite. Then A is recurrent and there
are no non-zero ˇ-harmonic vectors for A when ˇ > ˇ0.
Proof Note that eˇ0 is the spectral radius of AjNW. It follows from linear algebra that
there is a non-zero vector  W NW ! C and a complex number  2 C; jj D 1,
such that P

We say that A is row-ﬁnite when there are no inﬁnite emitter in G, i.e. when
# fw 2 V W Avw > 0g < 1
for all v 2 V.
Theorem 4.2 Let ˇ 2 R and assume that (4.1) holds for all v; w 2 V.
a) Assume that NW D ;. Then A is row-ﬁnite and there is a non-zero ˇ-harmonic
vector for A.
b) Assume that NW is non-empty but ﬁnite. There are no non-zero almost ˇ-
harmonic vectors for A.
c) Assume that NW is inﬁnite. There is a non-zero almost ˇ-harmonic vector if and
only if ˇ  ˇ0.
Proof In case a), it follows from Lemma 2.7 that A is row-ﬁnite. Case b) follows
from Lemma 3.7 and Corollary 3.8. It remains therefore only to show that there is
a non-zero almost ˇ-harmonic vector in case a) and c). To this end, ﬁx v0 2 V and

When G is strongly connected and A is row-ﬁnite, c) in Theorem 4.2 is a result
of Pruitt, [5]. When A is not row-ﬁnite it can happen, also when G is strongly
connected, that there are no non-zero ˇ-harmonic vectors for any ˇ  ˇ0 or that
they exist for some ˇ  ˇ0 and not for others. See [8] for such examples.
4.1
The Structure of the Positive Eigenvectors
We denote the set of almost ˇ-harmonic vectors for A by E.A; ˇ/. Assume that
E.A; ˇ/ ¤ 0. For a given vertex v0 2 V we set
E.A; ˇ/v0 D f 2 E.A; ˇ/ W v0 D 1g :
Equipped with the product topology RV is a locally convex real vector space, and
E.A; ˇ/ is a closed convex cone in RV. It follows from Lemma 2.5 that E.A; ˇ/v0 is
a base for E.A; ˇ/, and we aim now to show that E.A; ˇ/v0 is a compact Choquet
simplex1 and to obtain an integral representation of the elements in E.A; ˇ/v0,
analogous to the Poisson-Martin integral representation for the harmonic functions
of a countable state Markov chain, cf. e.g. Theorem 7.45 in [10]. For this purpose
we consider the partial ordering  in E.A; ˇ/ deﬁned such that    ,    2
E.A; ˇ/.
Lemma 4.3 E.A; ˇ/ is a lattice cone; i.e. every pair of elements ; 
 2 E.A; ˇ/ has
a least upper bound  _ 
 2 E.A; ˇ/ and a greatest lower bound  ^ 
 2 E.A; ˇ/
for the order .
Proof Given a vector  2 E.A; ˇ/ we let . h;  p/ be the unique pair such that
 h is ˇ-harmonic and  p a non-negative vector supported on V1 fulﬁlling that
 D  p C c
 p, cf. Lemma 10. (For simplicity of exposition we consider  p as a
non-negativevector on V with support in V1.) Given two vectors  ; ' W V ! Œ0; 1/

regarding Choquet simplices are nicely presented there.

It follows from Lemma 4.5 that Kˇ
v is a bounded function on Hv0, i.e. Kˇ
v 2
l1 .Hv0/ for all v 2 V. We denote by 1w the characteristic function of an element
w 2 Hv0. Let Aˇ be the C-subalgebra of l1 .Hv0/ generated by Kˇ
v ; v 2 V, and the
functions 1w; w 2 Hv0, and let Bˇ be the image of Aˇ in the quotient algebra
l1 .Hv0/ =c0 .Hv0nV1/ :

288
K. Thomsen
Here c0 .Hv0nV1/ denotes the ideal in l1 .Hv0/ consisting of the elements f W
Hv0 ! C with the property that for all  > 0 there is a ﬁnite subset F 
 Hv0nV1
such that jf.w/j   8w 2 Hv0nF. In particular, f.V1/ D f0g when V1 ¤ ; and
f 2 c0 .Hv0nV1/.
Note that it follows from Lemma 4.5 that for every v 2 V there is a ﬁnite subset
Fv 
 Hv0 such that
Kˇ
v C

is invertible in l1.Hv0/. Thus Aˇ and Bˇ are both unital C-algebras. Since they
are also separable, the set Xˇ of characters of Bˇ is a compact metric space and Bˇ
can be identiﬁed with C

Xˇ

via the Gelfand transform. Since evaluation at a vertex
w 2 V1 annihilates c0 .Hv0nV1/, each element of V1 gives rise to character on Bˇ
and hence an element of Xˇ. It follows that there is a canonical inclusion
V1 
 Xˇ:
(4.9)
For each v 2 V the function w 7! Kˇ
v .w/ is an element of Aˇ and its image in Bˇ
is a continuous function on Xˇ which we also denote by Kˇ
v . Let M

Xˇ

denote the
set of Borel probability measures on Xˇ. We consider M

Xˇ

as a compact convex
set in the weak*-topology obtained by considering the measures as elements of the
dual of C.Xˇ/.
Theorem 4.6 Let ˇ 2 R. Assume that NW D ; or that NW is inﬁnite. Assume

compact Choquet simplex we need only show that E.A; ˇ/v0 is compact in RV, cf.

subset of the character space of Aˇ. It follows that there is a sequence fukg 
 Hv0
such that Kˇ
v .x/ D limk!1 Kˇ
v .uk/ for all v 2 V. Since Bˇ is the quotient of Aˇ by
the ideal c0.Hv0nV1/, the sequence fukg must eventually leave every ﬁnite subset
of Hv0nV1, and since x … V1 it must also eventually leave every ﬁnite subset of
V1. That is, limk!1 uk D 1 in the sense that for any ﬁnite set F of vertexes there
is an N 2 N such that uk … F 8k  N. It follows then from (4.4) that (4.11) holds
for all v 2 V with equality when v … V1. This shows that the inequality

To obtain (4.10) it remains to show that E.A; ˇ/v0

When A is sub-stochastic, irreducible and ˇ D 0, it follows from the abstract
characterisation given in Theorem 7.13 of [10] that the spectrum of Aˇ is the Martin
compactiﬁcation of the associated Markov chain, cf. Deﬁnition 7.17 in [10], while
Xˇ is the Martin boundary when A is also row-ﬁnite (has ﬁnite range in the sense of
[10]). When A is not row-ﬁnite Xˇ consists of the Martin boundary and the vertexes
V1.
Let ıx denote the Dirac measure at a point x 2 Xˇ. Then
I.ıx/v D Kˇ

sequence fwkg of distinct elements in Hv0 such that

Recall now that under a continuous afﬁne surjection between compact convex sets,
the pre-image of an extremal point is a closed face and therefore contains an

of the extreme points in E.A; ˇ/v0.

that P1

Every inﬁnite emitter w 2 V1 gives rise to an extremal element in E.A; ˇ/v0
via the formula (4.17) (in the transient case we consider here). This follows from
the uniqueness part in the Riesz decomposition lemma, Lemma 3.3. The question

292
K. Thomsen
about which sequences of vertexes fwkg give rise to extremal ˇ-harmonic by the
formula (4.16) is generally much more difﬁcult to answer. But at least we shall
show below that the vertexes in fwkg can be chosen to be the vertexes in an inﬁnite
path in G without repeated vertexes. It follows from this that there are cases where
A is not row-ﬁnite and where there are no non-zero ˇ-harmonic vectors, for any
ˇ, because there are no paths in G of this sort. This can occur also when all our
standing assumptions hold and G is strongly connected. See Example 2.9 in [6].
Let @E.A; ˇ/v0 be the extreme boundary of the Choquet simplex E.A; ˇ/v0. By
identifying an element x 2 Xˇ with the corresponding Dirac measure ıx 2 M.Xˇ/,
we have an inclusion Xˇ 
 M.Xˇ/, and we set
@Xˇ D Xˇ \ I1.@E.A; ˇ/v0/;
which is a Borel subset of Xˇ, cf. Theorem 4.1.11 in [1]. Thus @Xˇ consists of the
elements x 2 Xˇ for which v 7! Kˇ
v .x/ is extremal in E.A; ˇ/v0, and it corresponds
to the minimal Martin boundary, [10], when Xˇ is identiﬁed as a Martin boundary.

where @H.A; ˇ/v0 is the set of extremal ˇ-harmonic elements of E.A; ˇ/v0. It
sufﬁces therefore now to show that I is injective on @Xˇ \ I1.@H.A; ˇ/v0/. Since
I.u/ is not ˇ-harmonic when u 2 V1, it follows that

coming from the stochastic matrix B from (4.19). Since  is extremal in E.A; ˇ/v0
the constant vector 1 is minimal harmonic for the stochastic matrix B restricted to
Hv0. It follows therefore from Theorem 5.1 in [7] that with respect to the measure
mv0 almost all elements in

from Theorems 3.2 and 3.4 in [10] that the set

which is the same set as f.xi/ 2 P.V/ W x1 D v0; limi!1 xi D 1g. Hence the set
of elements .xi/ from (4.22) for which (4.23) holds for all v 2 Hv0 and at the same
have the property that limi!1 xi D 1, is also a set of full mv0-measure. Since

Classiﬁcation of Graph Algebras: A Selective
Survey
Mark Tomforde
Abstract This survey reports on current progress of programs to classify graph
C-algebras and Leavitt path algebras up to Morita equivalence using K-theory.
Beginning with an overview and some history, we trace the development of
the classiﬁcation of simple and nonsimple graph C-algebras and state theorems
summarizing the current status of these efforts. We then discuss the much more
nascent efforts to classify Leavitt path algebras, and we describe the current status
of these efforts as well as outline current impediments that must be solved for this
classiﬁcation program to progress. In particular, we give two speciﬁc open problems
that must be addressed in order to identify the correct K-theoretic invariant for
classiﬁcation of simple Leavitt path algebras, and we discuss the signiﬁcance of
various possible outcomes to these open problems.

Introduction
In 1976 Elliott proved a result, now known as Elliott’s theorem, which states that
direct limits of semisimple ﬁnite-dimensional algebras may be classiﬁed up to
isomorphism by the dimension group (later identiﬁed with the scaled, ordered K0-
group) of the algebra. Elliott’s theorem implies that for the class of AF-algebras (i.e.,
C-algebraic direct limits of ﬁnite-dimensional C-algebras) the scaled, ordered
topological K0-group is a complete isomorphism invariant, and it also implies that
in the class of ultramatricial algebras (i.e., algebraic direct limits of direct sums
of semisimple ﬁnite-dimensional algebras over a ﬁxed ﬁeld) the scaled, ordered
algebraic K0-group is a complete isomorphism invariant. (In this case the algebraic
K0-group and topological K0-group coincide.) Based on this result, Elliott boldly
proposed that many additional classes of (C-)algebras can be classiﬁed up to
isomorphism by K-theoretic invariants, and he famously formulated what is now
called Elliott’s conjecture: “All separable nuclear simple C-algebras are classiﬁed
up to isomorphism by K-theoretic invariants.” Work on this conjecture has been
referred to as the Elliott program, and over the past four decades there have been

numerous contributions made by several mathematicians, not the least of which
are due to Elliott himself. Very recently, work of Tikuisis, White, and Winter has
completed the ﬁnal steps for classifying all unital, separable, simple, and nuclear
C-algebras of ﬁnite nuclear dimension which satisfy the UCT [21].
The established work on the Elliott program is vast—indeed, papers on the
subject total thousands of pages and even a survey of all the accomplishments over
the past four decades would most likely require a document the size of a book
if it wished to be comprehensive. (See the book [16] for an introductory survey
of the Elliott program with an emphasis on providing a technical overview of the
Kirchberg-Phillips classiﬁcation theorem, and see the papers [9, 17] for a summary
of the accomplishments in the Elliott program over the past 15 years.)
In the discussions here we wish to focus on two natural extensions of the Elliott
program:
Extension 1:
Go beyond the simple C-algebras and attempt to classify certain
nonsimple nuclear C-algebras using K-theory.
Extension 2:
Step outside of the class of C-algebras and attempt to classify
certain simple algebras using (algebraic) K-theory.
Of course there is little to no hope these two extensions can be accomplished
for all nuclear C-algebras or all simple algebras, so one major component of
each program is to identify classes of nonsimple C-algebras and simple algebras
that are amenable to classiﬁcation. Another major component of each program is
determining exactly what K-theoretic data is needed for the classifying invariant.
Signiﬁcant progress for Extension 1 has been made for the class of graph C-
algebras, while progress for Extension 2 has been more difﬁcult, but had some
stunning successes for the class of Leavitt path algebras. These two classes, which
we collectively refer to as graph algebras, will be the focus of this survey.
Readers who have no prior experience with graph algebras may initially (and
incorrectly!) believe these classes are fairly small and specialized. However, keep in
mind that every AF-algebra is Morita equivalent to a graph C-algebra [5] and every
ultramatricial algebra over C is Morita equivalent to a Leavitt path algebra. Thus the
graph C-algebras and Leavitt path algebras are generalizations of the AF-algebras
and ultramatricial algebras to which Elliott’s theorem from 1976 applies. As such,
they are very suitable classes to explore at the beginnings of these programs.
Moreover, every Kirchberg algebra with free K1-group is Morita equivalent to
a graph C-algebra [20], so the class of graph C-algebras also generalizes many
of the simple C-algebras to which the Kirchberg-Phillips classiﬁcation theorem
applies [14]. Consequently, the graph C-algebras comprise a large class containing
several nonsimple C-algebras as well as many simple C-algebras of both AF
and purely inﬁnite type. At the same time, the graph Calgebras are not too large
to escape classiﬁcation. The proposed invariant, called the ﬁltered (or sometimes
“ﬁltrated”) K-theory, is a natural generalization of the invariant used for simple
C-algebras, and contains the collection of all ordered K0-groups and K1-groups of
subquotients of the C-algebra taking into account all the natural transformations
among them. While this seems like the obvious choice for the invariant, Meyer and

Classiﬁcation of Graph Algebras: A Selective Survey
299
Nest have constructed two separable, purely inﬁnite C-algebras in the bootstrap
class (each with a primitive ideal space having four points) that have the same
ﬁltered K-theory but are not Morita equivalent, thus demonstrating that ﬁltered
K-theory is inadequate to classify general nonsimple nuclear C-algebras. This
example also means that restricting to the class of graph algebras is not an artiﬁcial
choice, but done out of necessity to obtain working theorems. The counterexamples
of Meyer and Nest lie outside the class of graph C-algebras, and the current
working conjecture is that ﬁltered K-theory sufﬁces to classify graph C-algebras.
While a promising candidate for the classifying invariant of graph C-algebras
has been identiﬁed, and many initial cases have been established successfully (see
[6] for a taxonomy), classiﬁcation results for Leavitt path algebras have been more
piecemeal, and the correct invariant for classiﬁcation is still uncertain. In this survey,
we give a summary of the current status of classiﬁcation results for simple and
nonsimple graph C-algebras, and we describe how these results have guided initial
work on classifying the simple Leavitt path algebras. We also outline the existing
classiﬁcation results for simple Leavitt path algebras, and describe the current search
for a complete Morita equivalence invariant in terms of K-theory. We state two
important open questions currently facing the classiﬁcation program for simple
Leavitt path algebras, and we also discuss the implications of various answers to
these two open questions.
The “selective survey” of the title refers to the fact that our attention will be
primarily be concentrated on the “geometric” classiﬁcations described in terms of
moves on the graphs. We will discuss the role that dynamical systems have played in
these geometric classiﬁcations, and outline how dynamics results have been applied
to graph algebras. We will omit proofs in favor of focusing on the big picture, but do
our best to explain the key ideas used to obtain results. In addition, to avoid getting
bogged down in too many technicalities, throughout this survey we shall restrict
our attention to classiﬁcation up to Morita equivalence (eschewing any mention of
results for classiﬁcation up to isomorphism).
In addition to giving an update on current research, the author believes that the
narrative, like many instances of mathematical investigation, provides an interesting
story of the twists and turns that have occurred as several researchers have
contributed to an area of investigation.

Preliminaries
In this section we establish notation and state some standard deﬁnitions. To begin,
we mention that we shall allow inﬁnite graphs, but work under the standing
hypothesis that all our graphs are countable.

M. Tomforde
Deﬁnition 2.1 A graph .E0; E1; r; s/ consists of a countable set E0 of vertices, a
countable set E1 of edges, and maps r W E1 ! E0 and s W E1 ! E0 identifying the
range and source of each edge. A graph is ﬁnite if both the vertex set E0 and the
edge set E1 are ﬁnite.
Let E WD .E0; E1; r; s/ be a graph. We say that a vertex v 2 E0 is a sink if s1.v/ D
;, and we say that a vertex v 2 E0 is an inﬁnite emitter if js1.v/j D 1. A singular
vertex is a vertex that is either a sink or an inﬁnite emitter, and we denote the set of
singular vertices by E0
sing. We also let E0
reg WD E0 n E0
sing, and refer to the elements
of E0
reg as regular vertices; i.e., a vertex v 2 E0 is a regular vertex if and only if
0 < js1.v/j < 1.
2.1
Deﬁnitions of Graph Algebras
Graph C-algebras were introduced in the 1990s, motivated by (and generalizing)
earlier constructions, such as the Cuntz algebras and the Cuntz-Krieger algebras.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (The Graph C-Algebra) If E is a graph, the graph C-algebra
C.E/ is the universal C-algebra generated by mutually orthogonal projections
fpv W v 2 E0g and partial isometries with mutually orthogonal ranges fse W e 2 E1g
satisfying
1. s

2. ses
e  ps.e/
for all e 2 E1
3. pv D P
fe2E1Ws.e/Dvg ses
e
for all v 2 E0
reg.
Based on the success of graph C-algebras, in 2005 algebraists were inspired to
deﬁne algebraic analogues, which are called Leavitt path algebras [1].
Deﬁnition 2.3 (The Leavitt Path Algebra) Let E be a graph, and let K be a ﬁeld.
We let .E1/ denote the set of formal symbols fe W e 2 E1g. The Leavitt path
algebra of E with coefﬁcients in K, denoted LK.E/, is the free associative K-algebra
generated by a set fv W v 2 E0g of pairwise orthogonal idempotents, together with
a set fe; e W e 2 E1g of elements, modulo the ideal generated by the following
relations:
1. s.e/e D er.e/ D e for all e 2 E1
2. r.e/e D es.e/ D e for all e 2 E1
3. ef D ıe;f r.e/ for all e; f 2 E1
4. v D

As with the graph C-algebras, the Leavitt path algebras include many well-known
classes of algebras and have been studied intensely in the algebra community since
their introduction. The interplay between these two classes of “graph algebras” has
been extensive and mutually beneﬁcial—graph C-algebra results have helped to

Classiﬁcation of Graph Algebras: A Selective Survey
301
guide the development of Leavitt path algebras by suggesting what results are true
and in what direction investigations should be focused, and Leavitt path algebras
have given a better understanding of graph C-algebras by helping to identify those
aspects of C.E/ that are algebraic, rather than C-algebraic, in nature. Moreover,
results from each class have had nontrivial applications to the other, and the work of
researchers from each side has guided discovery for the other. Indeed, nearly every
theorem from each class seems to have a corresponding theorem in the other. For
example, the graph-theoretic conditions on E for which C.E/ is a simple algebra
(respectively, an AF-algebra, a purely inﬁnite simple algebra, an exchange ring, a
ﬁnite-dimensional algebra) in the category of C-algebras are precisely the same
graph-theoretic conditions on E for which LK.E/ is a simple algebra (respectively,
an ultramatricial algebra, a purely inﬁnite simple algebra, an exchange ring, a ﬁnite-
dimensional algebra) in the category of K-algebras. The exact reason for these
similar properties is a bit of a mystery—the graph C-algebra and Leavitt path
algebra theorems are proven using different techniques, and the theorems for one
class do not seem to imply the theorems for the other in any obvious way. It has
been suggested that there may exist some kind of “Rosetta Stone” that would allow
for translating and deducing one set of theorems from the other, but currently such
a Rosetta Stone remains elusive.
We mention that when the underlying ﬁeld of the Leavitt path is the complex
numbers, then LC.E/ is isomorphic to a dense -subalgebra of C.E/. However,
this alone is not enough to account for the similar results, since it is possible for
dense -subalgebras to have considerably different properties and structure from
the ambient C-algebra.
It is also noteworthy that the ﬁeld plays little role in most theorems for the Leavitt
path algebras, and properties of LK.E/ are frequently obtained entirely in terms of
the graph E with no dependence on the ﬁeld K. We will see in the ﬁnal section of
this survey that classiﬁcation by K-theory is one of the few examples where this
is not true, and the underlying ﬁeld will be important in our theorems and in the
invariants used for classiﬁcation of simple Leavitt path algebras.
2.2
Computation of K-Groups
We shall use the notation Kn.A/ for the nth topological K-group of a C-algebra
A, and we shall use the notation Kalg
n .R/ for the nth algebraic K-group of a ring
R. Due to a phenomenon called Bott periodicity, for any C-algebra A we have
Kn.A/ Š KnC2.A/ for all n 2 Z. Thus for C-algebras, all K-group information is
contained in the K0-group and K1-group, and these are typically the only K-groups
mentioned. For rings (and Leavitt path algebras) there is no periodicity and all the
algebraic K-groups may be distinct.
Computation of the topological K-groups of a graph C-algebra and the algebraic
K-groups of a Leavitt path algebra is described in the following deﬁnition and
proposition.

Throughout this survey we shall be concerned with classiﬁcation of C-algebras
and algebras up to Morita equivalence. If A is an algebra (or C-algebra) from a
given class, and an object I.A/ is assigned to A, we call the assignment a Morita
equivalence invariant for the class if
A Morita equivalent to B H) I.A/ D I.B/
for all A; B in the class
and we call the assignment a complete Morita equivalence invariant for the class if
A Morita equivalent to B ” I.A/ D I.B/

Classiﬁcation of Simple and Nonsimple Graph
C-Algebras
All graph C-algebras are nuclear and in the bootstrap class to which the UCT
applies. Furthermore, the standing assumption that our graphs are countable ensures
the associated graph C-algebras are separable. Simple graph C-algebras are either

304
M. Tomforde
AF (and classiﬁed by Elliott’s theorem) or purely inﬁnite (and classiﬁed by the
Kirchberg-Phillips classiﬁcation theorem). Consequently, when E is a graph and
C.E/ is simple, the pair
..K0.C.E//; K0.C.E//C/; K1.C.E///
consisting of the (pre-)ordered K0-group together with the K1-group is a complete
Morita equivalence invariant for C.E/. By looking at the ordering on the K0-
group, we can tell whether C.E/ is purely inﬁnite or AF: If K0.C.E//C D
K0.C.E//, then C.E/ is purely inﬁnite and the invariant reduces to the pair
.K0.C.E//; K1.C.E//; while if K0.C.E//C ¨ K0.C.E//, then C.E/ is AF,
K1.C.E// D 0, and the ordered K0-group
.K0.C.E//; K0.C.E//C/
classiﬁes C.E/ up to Morita equivalence.
While the classiﬁcation of simple graph C-algebras is a special case of the
existing classiﬁcation theorems for simple nuclear C-algebras (speciﬁcally Elliott’s
theorem and the Kirchberg-Phillips classiﬁcation theorem), rather than merely
considering the graph C-algebra result as a corollary, it perhaps better to take a
historical view and think of simple graph C-algebras as the test cases that provided
intermediate steps successively leading to more general theorems for classifying
simple nuclear C-algebras. Indeed, the classiﬁcation of AF-algebras up to Morita
equivalence given by Elliott’s theorem, which initiated the entire classiﬁcation
program, is tantamount to classifying C-algebras of graphs with no cycles (since
the two classes coincide up to Morita equivalence). Likewise, the purely inﬁnite
simple graph C-algebras (especially particular subclasses) provided important
initial steps leading to the Kirchberg-Phillips Classiﬁcation theorem.
For example, Cuntz ﬁrst calculated the K-theory of the Cuntz algebra On (which
is the C-algebra of a graph with one vertex and n edges) in the paper [3], showing
that K0.On/ Š Z=nZ. This implies a very speciﬁc case of the Kirchberg-Phillips
theorem for the Cuntz algebras: Om is Morita equivalent to On ” K0.Om/ Š
K0.On/ ” m D n.
Likewise, the classiﬁcation of simple Cuntz-Krieger algebras was an important
early step in the classiﬁcation program. (The Cuntz-Krieger algebras are precisely
the C-algebras of ﬁnite graphs with no sinks or sources.) Simple Cuntz-Krieger
algebras are purely inﬁnite and classiﬁed up to Morita equivalence by their K0-
group. (The K1-group turns out to be redundant, because the K1-group of a Cuntz-
Krieger algebra is isomorphic to the free part of the K0-group.) The groundwork for
this classiﬁcation was laid by Cuntz and Krieger [4], who recognized the connection
with dynamics, and the ﬁnal portions of the classiﬁcation were later established by
Rørdam (using an important lemma outlined by Cuntz in a talk) [15]. We will return
to this result, its proof, and the connection with dynamics in the next section.
In addition to providing stepping stones toward more general classiﬁcation
theorems for simple nuclear C-algebras, the graph C-algebras have also provided

Classiﬁcation of Graph Algebras: A Selective Survey
305
a class for exploring classiﬁcation of nonsimple C-algebras. In a graph C-algebra
with ﬁnitely many ideals, each quotient and each ideal is Morita equivalent to a
graph C-algebra, so any graph C-algebra with ﬁnitely many ideals may be built
up from the simple graph C-algebras by taking extensions a ﬁnite number of times.
The invariant used to classify a nonsimple graph C-algebra C.E/ is called the
ﬁltered (or sometimes “ﬁltrated”) K-theory and denoted FKC
X .C.E//, where X is
the primitive ideal space of C.E/. The ﬁltered K-theory contains the collection
of all ordered K0-groups and K1-groups of subquotients of the C-algebra, taking
into account all the natural transformations among them (see [6, §1] for a precise
deﬁnition). When C.E/ has a single (nonzero) ideal, the ﬁltered K-theory is simply
the six-term exact sequence in K-theory (including the ordering on all K0-groups)
determined by the unique ideal. Eilers and the author [8] proved that the ﬁltered K-
theory (i.e., the six-term exact sequence) is a complete Morita equivalence invariant
for the class of graph C-algebras with one ideal. This kicked off a ﬂurry activity
in which several researchers established classiﬁcation results for graph C-algebras
with multiple ideals. A summary of these results and description of the status quo for
this program can be found in the survey [6]—in particular, the authors there describe
how we have a complete classiﬁcation of graph C-algebras with a primitive ideal
space having three or fewer points, and for graph C-algebras whose primitive ideal
space has four points 103 of the 125 cases have been solved, leaving less than one
ﬁfth of the cases open. In addition, as we will discuss at the end of Sect. 4, Eilers,
Restorff, and Ruiz recently announced that they have recently shown that ﬁltered K-
theory is a complete Morita equivalence invariant for all unital graph C-algebras.

In Search of Techniques to Classify Algebras: Shift Spaces,
Flow Equivalence, and Moves on Graphs
Many of the techniques used to establish classiﬁcation theorems for C-algebras
have no hope of going through for general algebras. Indeed, the classiﬁcation proofs
frequently make use of the C-algebra structure (e.g., the completeness is used
frequently to take limits). As one undertakes a classiﬁcation of algebras, the ﬁrst step
is to begin with simple algebras. In addition, it is sensible to restrict initial attention
to algebras that are somehow similar to the C-algebras for which the classiﬁcation
program had early successes using more modest methods. The graph C-algebras
(particularly the Cuntz-Krieger algebras) are such a class, and hence their algebraic
analogues, the Leavitt path algebras (particularly Leavitt path algebras of ﬁnite
graphs), arise as natural candidates for attempts at classiﬁcation.
Simple Leavitt path algebras exhibit a dichotomy similar to simple graph C-
algebras: A simple Leavitt path algebra is either ultramatricial (if the graph has no
cycles) or purely inﬁnite (if the graph has a cycle). In the ultramatricial case, Elliott’s
theorem applies and the Leavitt path algebra is classiﬁed by its ordered K0-group.
In the purely inﬁnite case, we seek an algebraic analogue of the Kirchberg-Phillips

306
M. Tomforde
classiﬁcation theorem, and therefore we look at how the classiﬁcation was obtained
for early investigations into special cases—more speciﬁcally, we shall carefully
examine the classiﬁcation of simple Cuntz-Krieger algebras.
The Cuntz-Krieger algebras correspond to C-algebras of ﬁnite graphs with no
sinks and no sources, and the simplicity of the Cuntz-Krieger algebras corresponds
to the graph being strongly connected (i.e., for each pair of vertices v and w there is a
path from v to w and a path from w to v) and not a single cycle. Let E D .E0; E1; r; s/
be a ﬁnite graph with no sinks and no sources. One may deﬁne the (two-sided) shift
space
XE WD f: : : e2e1:e0e1e2 : : : W ei 2 E1 and r.ei/ D s.eiC1/ for all i 2 Zg
consisting of all bi-inﬁnite paths in the graph, together with the shift map  W XE !
XE given by .: : : e2e1:e0e1e2 : : :/ D : : : e1e0:e1e2e3 : : :. Cuntz and Krieger
observed a connection between the (characterizations of) ﬂow equivalence of this
dynamical system and the Morita equivalence class of the C-algebra associated
with the graph.
If E and F are ﬁnite graphs with no sinks and no sources, the shift spaces
XE and XF are ﬂow equivalent if their suspension ﬂows are homeomorphic via a
homeomorphism that carries orbits to orbits and preserves each orbit’s orientation.
A precise deﬁnition of ﬂow equivalence may be found in [12, §13.6], but as we
shall see shortly, for the purposes of this survey one does not need to understand
ﬂow equivalence so much as note that it is equivalent to other conditions.
Franks gave an algebraic characterization of ﬂow equivalence for strongly
connected graphs: If E and F are strongly connected ﬁnite graphs, then XE and
XF are ﬂow equivalent if and only if
coker.1  At
E/ D coker.1  At
F/ and sgn.det.1  At
E// D sgn.det.1  At
F/:
Here AE is the vertex matrix of the graph E, and sgn.det.1  At
E// is the sign of the
number det.1  At
E/; i.e., the value C, , or 0.
In addition, Parry and Sullivan gave a different characterization of ﬂow equiva-
lence based on “moves”; i.e., operations that may be performed on the graph and
which preserve ﬂow equivalence of the associated shift space. Parry and Sullivan
needed three moves for their characterization, which are named as follows:
Move (O): Outsplitting
Move (I): Insplitting
Move (R): Reduction
Precise deﬁnitions of these moves can be found in [18, §3], but for the purposes of
this survey any readers unfamiliar with the moves may be better served by informal
descriptions: Outsplitting allows one to partition the outgoing edges of a vertex into
nonempty sets and “split” the vertex and incoming edges so that each set of outgoing
edges from the partition now emits from its own vertex. Insplitting allows one to
partition the ingoing edges of a vertex into nonempty sets and “split” the vertex and
outgoing edges so that each set of ingoing edges from the partition now enters its

Classiﬁcation of Graph Algebras: A Selective Survey
307
own vertex. Reduction allows one to “collapse” certain vertices that have a single
edge going from one vertex to the other.
For each move there is also an inverse move, so that if a Move X is applied to the
graph E to obtain the graph E0, we say E is obtained by performing the inverse of
Move X to E0. Although we will not need their names, for the reader’s ediﬁcation
we mention that the inverse of outsplitting is called outamalgamation, the inverse
of insplitting is called inamalgamation, and the inverse of reduction is called delay.
Parry and Sullivan proved that if E and F are strongly connected graphs, then XE
and XF are ﬂow equivalent if and only if the graph E may turned into the graph F
by ﬁnitely many applications of Moves (O), (I), (R), and their inverses.
Combining Franks result with the result of Parry and Sullivan, we thus obtain the
following:
Theorem 4.1 (Franks, Parry and Sullivan) Let E and F be strongly connected
ﬁnite graphs. Then the following are equivalent:
(1) The shift spaces XE and XF are ﬂow equivalent.
(2) coker.1  At
E/ D coker.1  At
F/ and sgn.det.1  At
E// D sgn.det.1  At
F//.
(3) The graph E may turned into the graph F by ﬁnitely many applications of Moves
(O), (I), (R), and their inverses.
Cuntz and Krieger had multiple insights to recognize the relationship of ﬂow
equivalence with the Morita equivalence of Cuntz-Krieger algebras. First, after
calculating the K-groups of a Cuntz-Krieger algebra, Cuntz and Krieger observed
that the K0-group coincides with the group coker.1  At
E/ appearing in the ﬂow
equivalence classiﬁcation. (This group is sometimes called the Bowen-Franks group
by dynamicists.) The second important observation of Cuntz and Krieger was
that the Moves (O), (I), (R) (and consequently their inverses) preserve Morita
equivalence of the associated C-algebra.
These observations, combined with Theorem 4.1, imply that if E and F are
strongly connected ﬁnite graphs with isomorphic K0-groups and with sgn.det.1 
At
E// D sgn.det.1  At
F//, then E can be transformed into F using a ﬁnite number
of Moves (O), (I), (R) and their inverses, and consequently the C-algebras of E
and F are Morita equivalent. (Note that we really only need the equivalence of (2)
and (3) in Theorem 4.1, and for the purposes of Cuntz and Krieger’s result, we can
completely ignore the notion of ﬂow equivalence if we wish, viewing (2) ” (3)
as a purely combinatorial fact about graphs.)
Although Cuntz and Krieger formulated their study of the Cuntz-Krieger algebras
in terms of matrices, we wish to use the more modern approach of describing the
C-algebras in terms of graphs. The Cuntz-Krieger algebras may be thought of as
the C-algebras of ﬁnite graphs with no sinks or sources. If a graph C-algebra is
simple and purely inﬁnite, then the graph cannot contain a sink, so when we restrict
to the simple purely inﬁnite case we automatically have the “no sinks” condition for
Cuntz-Krieger algebras. However, we do need a method to deal with sources, and to

308
M. Tomforde
accomplish this we introduce a new move:
Move (S): Source Removal
A precise deﬁnition of Move (S) can be found in [18, §3], but an informal
description is fairly accurate and informative: To perform Move (S) we select a
source vertex in the graph and then remove this vertex and all edges beginning at
this vertex. As with the other moves, Move (S) preserves Morita equivalence of the
associated C-algebra. The is also an inverse move called source addition. Note that
the process of performing Move (S) removes a source, but may create other sources
in doing so. Nonetheless, one can easily show that in a ﬁnite graph with no sinks,
repeated applications of Move (S) will ultimately (and in a ﬁnite number of steps)
result in a graph with no sources.
The following is a reformulation of Cuntz and Krieger’s result in the language of
graphs that also takes the presence of sources into account.
Theorem 4.2 (Cuntz and Krieger) Let E and F be ﬁnite graphs for which C.E/
and C.F/ are simple and purely inﬁnite. If K0.C.E// Š K0.C.F// and
sgn.det.1  At
E// D sgn.det.1  At
F//;
then C.E/ is Morita equivalent to C.F/. Moreover, in this case, the graph E may
turned into the graph F by ﬁnitely many applications of Moves (S), (O), (I), (R), and
their inverses.
Cuntz and Krieger suspected that sgn.det.1At
E// was not a necessary condition
for Morita equivalence of the C-algebras, but they were unable to remove the
hypothesis from their theorem. It was not until 15 years later that Rørdam was able
to remove the “sign of the determinant” condition and obtain a complete Morita
equivalence invariant for Cuntz-Krieger algebras. To accomplish this, Rørdam used
an additional graph move that did not appear in the study of ﬂow equivalence.
This move is called the Cuntz splice, and because it will be important for us in
the remainder of this survey, we shall describe it in greater detail than the other
moves.
Move (CS): Cuntz Splice
If E is a graph and v is any vertex in E that is the base of two distinct cycles, then
Move (CS) is performed by “splicing” on the following additional portion to E:
Here is an example showing the Cuntz splice performed on a graph with two vertices
and three edges to produce a new graph with four vertices and nine edges.

Example 4.3
Cuntz splice
•
•
Unlike the other moves, we shall have no need of an inverse move for the Cuntz
splice. The usefulness of the Cuntz splice is due to the following fact: If E is
a graph and E is obtained by performing a Cuntz splice to a vertex of E, then
K0.C.E// Š K0.C.E// and sgn.det.I  At
E// D  sgn.det.I  At
E//. In other
words, the Cuntz splice preserves the K0-group of the associated C-algebra while
“ﬂipping” the sign of the determinant. Rørdam’s main contribution was to prove that
the Cuntz splice preserves Morita equivalence of the associated C-algebra. Using
this fact, one can start with two purely inﬁnite simple graph C-algebras having
the same K0-group. If the signs of the determinants are the same, simply apply
Theorem 4.2 to deduce Morita equivalence. If not, apply the Cuntz splice once to
one of the graphs to switch the sign of the determinant, and then apply Theorem 4.2
to deduce Morita equivalence. Rørdam phrased his result in terms of the matrix
description of Cuntz-Krieger algebras, but we reformulate it here in the modern
language of graphs, which also takes the presence of sources into account.
Theorem 4.4 (Rørdam) Let E and F be ﬁnite graphs for which C.E/ and C.F/
are simple and purely inﬁnite. Then the following are equivalent:
(1) C.E/ is Morita equivalent to C.F/.
(2) K0.C.E// Š K0.C.F//.
(3) The graph E may turned into the graph F by ﬁnitely many applications of
Moves (S) (O), (I), (R), and their inverses, and at most one application of
Move (CS). Moreover, no applications of Move (CS) are needed if sgn.det.1 
At
E// D sgn.det.1  At
F//, and exactly one application of Move (CS) is required
otherwise.
Theorem 4.4 shows that K0.C.E// is a complete invariant for Morita equiva-
lence in the class of simple purely inﬁnite C-algebras of ﬁnite graphs. Even better
than that, Theorem 4.4 gives moves on the graph generating the equivalence relation
(in analogy to moves for other equivalence relations, such as the Reidemeister
moves for the isotopy class of a knot). This allows one to turn the question of
Morita equivalence of the C-algebras into a combinatorial problem on graphs. For
this reason, the moves of Theorem 4.4 are sometimes said to give a “geometric
classiﬁcation” of these graph C-algebras.
In addition, for ﬁnite graphs whose C-algebras are purely inﬁnite and simple,
Theorems 4.1 and 4.4 explain the precise relationship between ﬂow equiva-
lence of the shift space and Morita equivalence of the C-algebra. In particular,
K0.C.E// is a complete invariant for Morita equivalence of C.E/, and the pair
.K0.C.E//; sgn.det.1  At
E/// is a complete invariant for ﬂow equivalence of
XE. Consequently, for these graphs the ﬂow equivalence of the shift space is

310
M. Tomforde
a ﬁner equivalence relation than Morita equivalence of the C-algebra (i.e., XE
ﬂow equivalent to XF implies that C.E/ is Morita equivalent to C.F/, but not
conversely in general).
After Rørdam’s work and this geometric classiﬁcation of Cuntz-Krieger algebras,
efforts in the classiﬁcation program progressed in ways that were less “geometric”.
However, in 2005 Abrams and Aranda Pino introduced Leavitt path algebras. In
2008, approximately 13 years after the geometric classiﬁcation for simple Cuntz-
Krieger algebras was obtained, Abrams, Louly, Pardo, and Smith were inspired to
seek a similar geometric classiﬁcation for simple Leavitt path algebras of ﬁnite
graphs [2]. We will discuss the Leavitt path algebra classiﬁcation in Sect. 5, and
as with graph C-algebras we shall see the sign of the determinant condition is a
stumbling block. Unlike the C-algebra situation, however, this problem has not
been resolved and it is an open question as to whether the sign of the determinant
may be removed. We will discuss the ramiﬁcations of this question, and the
implications of possible answers, in the next section.
With Leavitt path algebra considerations causing attention to be returned to a
geometric classiﬁcation, Sørensen had the novel idea to reconsider the graph C-
algebras and seek geometric classiﬁcations for simple C-algebras of inﬁnite graphs
[19]. Although the Kirchberg-Phillips theorem, established in 2000, showed that
the pair of the K0-group and K1-group is a complete Morita equivalence invariant
for purely inﬁnite simple graph C-algebras, the result is highly non-geometric
and does not allow one to establish the Morita equivalence in any concrete or
constructive way. Sørensen’s key insight was to realize that classiﬁcation by moves
could still be obtained when the graph has a ﬁnite number of vertices and an inﬁnite
number of edges. In this case, the K-groups of the C-algebras are obtained as the
cokernel and kernel of a ﬁnite rectangular (but not square) matrix indexed by the
vertices. In this situation, due to the fact there are inﬁnitely many edges, one cannot
deﬁne a shift space as before. This is because deﬁnition of a shift spaces requires a
ﬁnite alphabet (i.e., ﬁnitely many edges) from which each position in the bi-inﬁnite
sequences may be chosen. Despite this, one can still focus on the equivalence of (2)
and (3) in Theorem 4.1, considering it as a purely combinatorial fact about graphs,
and seek an analogous result for inﬁnite graphs with ﬁnitely many vertices. As one
would expect, the object coker.IAt
E/ Š K0.C.E// from the ﬁnite graph case must
now be replaced by the pair .K0.C.E//; K1.C.E//. It is less clear what quantity
should play the analogous role of sgn.det.I  At
E//, since the matrix involved is not
square and hence its determinant does not exist. Surprisingly, Sørensen proved that
the sign of the determinant condition simply disappears in the presence of inﬁnitely
many edges, and—in what is even better news—this means there is no need for the
Cuntz splice. Sørensen’s results from [19] may be summarized as follows.

Classiﬁcation of Graph Algebras: A Selective Survey
311
Theorem 4.5 (Sørensen) Let E and F be graphs with a ﬁnite number of vertices
and an inﬁnite number of edges and with the property that C.E/ and C.F/ are
simple. Then the following are equivalent:
(1) C.E/ is Morita equivalent to C.F/.
(2) K0.C.E// Š K0.C.F// and K1.C.E// Š K1.C.F//.
(3) The graph E may turned into the graph F by ﬁnitely many applications of Moves
(S), (O), (I), (R), their inverses.
The fact that Sørensen’s result does not involve the Cuntz splice has two impor-
tant consequences: First, the moves (S), (O), (I), (R), and their inverses produce
explicit Morita equivalences, and consequently one can concretely construct the
imprimitivity bimodule linking C.E/ to C.F/ by using full corners of the C-
algebras of the intermediary graphs between E and F. (The Cuntz splice does
not produce an explicit Morita equivalence, so this concrete construction cannot
be accomplished for the ﬁnite graphs in Theorem 4.4 when sgn.det.1  At
E// ¤
sgn.det.1  At
F//.) Second, when seeking a version of Theorem 4.5 for Leavitt
path algebras, the sign of the determinant condition is no longer present to cause
difﬁculties.
A graph C-algebra C.E/ is unital precisely when the graph E has a ﬁnite
number of vertices. Since any unital simple graph C-algebra is either Morita
equivalent to C or purely inﬁnite, the combination of Theorems 4.4 and 4.5 gives a
complete classiﬁcation of unital simple graph C-algebras up to Morita equivalence.
In May 2015 Eilers, Restorff, Ruiz, and Sørensen posted a preprint [7] to
the arXiv in which they extended the geometric classiﬁcation to all unital graph
C-algebras of real rank zero. Speciﬁcally, they show that ﬁltered K-theory is a
complete Morita equivalence invariant for unital graph C-algebras of real rank
zero, and that when Morita equivalence occurs, one graph may be turned into the
other using a ﬁnite number of Moves (S), (O), (I), (R), their inverses, and Move
(CS). In July 2015, Eilers, Restorff, Ruiz, and Sørensen posted an update to their
arXiv entry stating that they are now able to remove the hypothesis of real rank zero
and give a geometric classiﬁcation for all unital graph C-algebras. They also stated
that the preprint [7] will not be published, and instead a paper with the more general
results (containing all results of [7] as special cases) will be written and published in
its place (see http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1505.06773). In talks, Eilers has stated
that the ﬁltered K-theory is a complete Morita equivalence invariant for unital graph
C-algebras and that a geometric classiﬁcation is possible. However, when the
unital graph C-algebra is not real rank zero, we must include one additional move
besides Moves (S), (O), (I), (R), their inverses, and Move (CS), in order to handle
the situation of cycles with no exits. Since this additional move was discovered
while Eilers and Restorff were visiting Ruiz at his home institution in Hawai’i, and
since the move involves a graphical picture similar to a butterﬂy, the authors have
tentatively called the move “pulelehua”—the Hawaiian word for butterﬂy.

Classiﬁcation of Leavitt Path Algebras of Finite Graphs
Since the Leavitt path algebras are deﬁned in a manner analogous to the graph C-
algebras, they are a natural candidate for a class of algebras that may be amenable to
classiﬁcation by K-theory. In addition, the geometric classiﬁcation of unital graph
C-algebras, described in terms of moves on the graph, provides a viable approach
to classiﬁcation for Leavitt path algebras.
Abrams, Louly, Pardo, and Smith initiated the classiﬁcation of Leavitt path
algebras in [2]. (A preprint of [2] was posted to the arXiv in 2008, and a published
version appeared in 2011.) To begin, they observed that for any graph E and any ﬁeld
K, one has Kalg
0 .LK.E// Š K0.C.E// so that the algebraic K0-group of the Leavitt
path algebra agrees with the K0-group of the graph C-algebra and is independent
of the ﬁeld K. In addition, Abrams, Louly, Pardo, and Smith proved that the graph
moves (S), (O), (I), (R), and their inverses preserve Morita equivalence of the Leavitt
path algebra of the graph. However, they were unable to determine whether or not
the Cuntz splice preserves Morita equivalence of the associated Leavitt path algebra.
Thus, following the proof strategy established by Cuntz and Krieger (with later
contributions by Rørdam), they could not avoid the sign of the determinant condition
and were only able to establish sufﬁcient conditions for Morita equivalence. We state
their result here.
Theorem 5.1 (Abrams, Louly, Pardo, and Smith) Let K be any ﬁeld, and let E
and F be ﬁnite graphs for which LK.E/ and LK.F/ are simple and purely inﬁnite. If
Kalg
0 .LK.E// Š Kalg
0 .LK.F// and sgn.det.1At
E// D sgn.det.1At
F/, then LK.E/ is
Morita equivalent to LK.F/. Moreover, in this case, the graph E may turned into the
graph F by ﬁnitely many applications of Moves (S), (O), (I), (R), and their inverses.
One noteworthy consequence of this result is that, as with most of the Leavitt path
algebra results, the ﬁeld plays no role in determining the Morita equivalence class
of the Leavitt path algebra for these particular types of graphs. Indeed, the invariant
sufﬁcient for classiﬁcation, the pair .Kalg
0 .LK.E//; sgn.det.1  At
E///, depends only
on the graph E and is independent of the ﬁeld.
Currently, it is unknown whether the sign of the determinant is a Morita equiv-
alence invariant for Leavitt path algebras. This puts the classiﬁcation program for
simple Leavitt path algebras of ﬁnite graphs in a similar state that the classiﬁcation
of simple graph C-algebras found itself in during the 15 years period following
Cuntz and Krieger’s work and prior to Rørdam’s contribution of the Cuntz splice. As
a result, resolving whether the sign of the determinant can be removed is currently
one of the central issues in the classiﬁcation of simple Leavitt path algebras. This
problem is equivalent to determining whether the Cuntz splice preserves Morita
equivalence, and thus the open question may be formulated as follows.
Open Question 1 Let K be a ﬁeld and let E be a ﬁnite graph such det.1  At
E/ ¤ 0
and LK.E/ is simple and purely inﬁnite. If E denotes the graph obtained by

performing a Cuntz splice to E, then are the Leavitt path algebras LK.E/ and
LK.E/ Morita equivalent?
This question has been open since the ﬁrst preprint of [2] appeared in 2008, and
it is currently at the forefront of the classiﬁcation program for Leavitt path algebras.
Many researchers have worked on this problem, but with little to show for their
efforts. In fact, we currently cannot answer the question in even elementary special
cases.
For example, suppose we take E2 to be the graph with one vertex and two edges
(arguably, the most basic example of the graphs the question is asking about), and
let E
2 be the graph obtained by performing a Cuntz splice at the vertex of E.
E2
•
E−
2
•
•
•
Then LK.E2/ is isomorphic to the Leavitt algebra L2, and we have Kalg
0 .LK.E2// Š
Kalg
0 .LK.E
2 // Š f0g, det.1  At
E2/ D 1, and det.1  At
E
2 / D 1. However, it is
currently an open question as to whether LK.E2/ and LK.E
2 / are Morita equivalent.
Besides restricting the graph, another approach to ﬁnding a more tractable special
case of Open Question 1 is to restrict the ﬁeld, for instance to ﬁx K D C or
K D Z2. However, no results for this special case have been obtained either. Even
combinations of these restrictions (i.e., restricting both the graph and the ﬁeld)
yield open problems—no one knows, for example, whether LC.E2/ and LC.E
2 /
are Morita equivalent, or whether LZ2.E2/ and LZ2.E
2 / are Morita equivalent.
In July 2015, Johansen and Sørensen announced the preprint [11], which to the
author’s knowledge contain some of the ﬁrst concrete results concerning the sign of
the determinant condition. Although Leavitt path algebras are deﬁned over ﬁelds,
as noted by the author in [22], for any graph E and any commutative ring R it is
possible to construct a Leavitt path algebra LR.E/ with coefﬁcients in R. Johansen
and Sørensen proved that if we choose the coefﬁcients to be the ring Z, then
LZ.E2/ is not -isomorphic to LZ.E
2 /. (This is contrasted with the graph C-algebra
situation, where C.E2/ is -isomorphic to C.E
2 /.) Consequently, the Cuntz splice
does not preserve -isomorphism of Leavitt path algebras over the ring Z. What this
means—if anything—for Morita equivalence (instead of -isomorphism) of Leavitt
path algebras over ﬁelds (instead of rings), is yet unclear. But at the very least,
Johansen and Sørensen’s result shows us that not all Cuntz splice results for graph
C-algebras will generalize to algebras over commutative rings, and this raises the
potential for some unexpected phenomena with Leavitt path algebras over ﬁelds.
More importantly, up to this point a preponderance of researchers’ efforts have
been spent trying to prove that the Cuntz splice does preserve Morita equivalence
of Leavitt path algebras (over ﬁelds). Johansen and Sørensen’s result suggests that
perhaps we should be spending more time trying to establish the negative.

The lack of an answer to Open Question 1 is currently a major stumbling block
in the classiﬁcation program for Leavitt path algebras. The fact we do not have
an answer, even in special cases or for elementary examples, indicates there is
something important about the structure of simple Leavitt path algebras that we
do not yet understand. In addition, Open Question 1 is not only an impediment
for classiﬁcation of simple Leavitt path algebras, but until we have a solution it
essentially impossible to classify nonsimple Leavitt path algebras of ﬁnite graphs—
to do so, we would most likely need to deal with the simple ideals and quotients,
which are as of yet unmanageable. Consequently, a solution to Open Question 1 is
of paramount importance for the classiﬁcation program for Leavitt path algebras.
Open Question 1 is compelling to the mathematical community not only for
its applications to classiﬁcation of algebras, but also because whatever the answer
turns out to be, it will have consequences for the subjects of Algebra, Functional
Analysis, and Dynamics. As the author sees it, there are three possible answers to
Open Question 1: “Yes”, “No”, and “Sometimes”.
If the answer is “Yes”, then this would provide further compelling evidence
for the existence of some sort of “Rosetta Stone” allowing for the translation of
results between graph C-algebras and Leavitt path algebras. Identifying the reason
for these similarities could lead to a deeper understanding of the relationships
between C-algebras and algebras. It could even serve as a call to action for more
collaboration between algebraists and analysts. Perhaps we can ﬁnd conditions
under which dense -subalgebras of C-algebras have structural properties similar
to their ambient C-algebras. Perhaps one can ﬁnd larger classes of algebras for
which analogues of C-algebra results can be proven. Or perhaps (if we dream big)
a version of the Kirchberg-Phillips classiﬁcation theorem could be proved for a large
class of purely inﬁnite simple algebras.
If the answer is “No”, meaning the sign of the determinant is an invariant
of Morita equivalence, then the pair .Kalg
0 .LK.E//; sgn.det.1  At
F/// would be a
complete Morita equivalence invariant for simple Leavitt path algebras of ﬁnite
graphs. This would imply that for ﬁnite strongly connected graphs, the Morita
equivalence class of the Leavitt path algebra coincides exactly with the ﬂow
equivalence class of the graph’s shift space (cf. Theorem 4.1). Consequently, we
would have that the Leavitt path algebras and shift spaces are intimately related,
suggesting that there is some deeper, not yet understood connection between the
algebras and the ﬂow dynamics.
If the answer is “Sometimes”, meaning that for certain graphs changing the sign
of the determinant (or performing a Cuntz splice) changes the Morita equivalence
class of the Leavitt path algebra but for other graphs it does not, then we will need to
identify exactly which graphs are affected. This would be the most surprising (and
hence for a mathematician the most interesting!) outcome to this question. If indeed
the answer does turn out to be “Sometimes”, this outcome will likely motivate the
creation and development of new tools and require the collaboration of algebraists,
analysts, and dynamicists to investigate the phenomena that occur.

Classiﬁcation of Leavitt Path Algebras of Inﬁnite Graphs
As we saw in the previous section, the sign of the determinant condition (and
unknown effect of the Cuntz splice) creates an impediment to classifying simple
Leavitt path algebras of ﬁnite graphs
However, if we continue to look to graph C-algebras for inspiration, we see
that Sørensen’s classiﬁcation of unital C-algebras of inﬁnite graphs avoided the
sign of the determinant and no Cuntz splice move was needed. One could therefore
hope for a similar classiﬁcation, using Sørensen’s techniques, for unital Leavitt
path algebras of inﬁnite graphs. (Such graphs have a ﬁnite number of vertices and
an inﬁnite number of edges.) This collection of graphs, while avoiding the Cuntz
splice, introduces a new problem: What is our candidate for the complete Morita
equivalence invariant? For C-algebras of ﬁnite graphs we used the K0-group, and
when we considered Leavitt path algebras of ﬁnite graphs, we were in the fortunate
situation that for any graph E we have Kalg
0 .LK.E// Š K0.C.E//. However, for
graphs with inﬁnitely many edges Sørensen now had to include the K1-group of
the C-algebra. In general, for a graph E one has that Kalg
1 .LK.E// and K1.C.E//
are not equal. In addition, due to Bott periodicity, a C-algebras really only has
only two K-groups: the K0-group and then K1-group. This means that by using
K0 and K1, Sørensen was including all the K-groups of the graph C-algebra in
the invariant. For Leavitt path algebras there is no periodicity and the algebraic
K-groups Kalg
n .LK.E// may all be distinct. Furthermore, for n  1 one has that
Kalg
n .LK.E// depends on the underlying ﬁeld of the Leavitt path algebra. This raises
the question as to which of the algebraic K-groups Kalg
n .LK.E// should be included
in the invariant. Kalg
0
and Kalg
1
only? Some ﬁnite number of algebraic K-groups? All
algebraic K-groups? Should the number of K-groups included depend on the ﬁeld?
Inspired by the techniques of Sørensen in [19], Ruiz and the author looked for an
invariant that would provide the moves needed between the graphs without worrying
about whether this invariant involved the algebraic K-groups. It was found that a
complete Morita equivalence invariant is provided by the pair .Kalg
0 .LK.E//; jE0
singj/.
Here jE0
singj is the cardinality of the set of singular vertices E0
sing. (Recall that a vertex
is singular if it either emits no edges or an inﬁnite number of edges.) Ruiz and the
author proved the following in [18].
Theorem 6.1 (Ruiz and Tomforde) Let K be a ﬁeld, and let E and F be graphs
with a ﬁnite number of vertices and an inﬁnite number of edges with the property
that LK.E/ and LK.F/ are simple. Then the following are equivalent:
(1) LK.E/ is Morita equivalent to LK.F/.
(2) Kalg
0 .LK.E// Š Kalg
0 .LK.F// and jE0
singj D jF0
singj.
(3) The graph E may turned into the graph F by ﬁnitely many applications of Moves
(S), (O), (I), (R), their inverses.
While this result shows that .Kalg
0 .LK.E//; jE0
singj/ is a complete Morita equiv-
alence invariant for unital simple Leavitt path algebras of inﬁnite graphs, this

316
M. Tomforde
invariant is unsatisfying because it depends on the choice of the graph used to
represent the Leavitt path algebra, rather than only on intrinsic properties of the
algebra itself. We prefer to have an invariant based solely on algebraic properties,
and if our goal is to lay groundwork for classiﬁcation of larger classes of algebras,
we hope that we can obtain an invariant described entirely in terms of K-theory.
Thus we ask whether or not some collection of the algebraic K-groups can
provide a complete Morita equivalence invariant for unital simple Leavitt path
algebras of inﬁnite graphs—or, equivalently, whether jE0
singj can be determined from
some collection of the algebraic K-groups.
In [18] Ruiz and the author showed that in certain situations the answer is “Yes”,
and surprisingly the answer depends on the underlying ﬁeld. (This is explained
by the fact that the higher algebraic K-groups of the Leavitt path algebra depend
signiﬁcantly on the underlying ﬁeld.) To describe the manageable ﬁelds, we need to
introduce a bit of terminology.
Deﬁnition 6.2 if G is an abelian group, we say G has no free quotients if no nonzero
quotient of G is a free abelian group. If K is a ﬁeld, we say K has no free quotients
if the multiplicative abelian group K WD K n f0g has no free quotients.
It is shown in [18, Proposition 6.10] that the following are all examples of ﬁelds
with no free quotients.
•
All ﬁelds K such that K is a torsion group.
•
All ﬁelds K such that K is weakly divisible.
•
All algebraically closed ﬁelds.
•
All ﬁelds that are perfect with characteristic p > 0.
•
All ﬁnite ﬁelds.
•
The ﬁeld C of complex numbers.
•
The ﬁeld R of real numbers.
The ﬁeld Q is not a ﬁeld with no free quotients, because Q Š Z2 ˚ Z ˚ Z ˚ : : :.
In [18] Ruiz and the author showed that when the underlying ﬁeld has no free
quotients, the pair .Kalg
0 .LK.E//; Kalg
1 .LK.E/// is a complete Morita equivalence
invariant. We emphasize that this includes the case when the underlying ﬁeld is
the complex numbers.
Theorem 6.3 (Ruiz and Tomforde) Let K be a ﬁeld with no free quotients (see
Deﬁnition 6.2), and let E and F be graphs with a ﬁnite number of vertices and an
inﬁnite number of edges, and with the property that LK.E/ and LK.F/ are simple.
Then the following are equivalent:
(1) LK.E/ is Morita equivalent to LK.F/.
(2) Kalg
0 .LK.E// Š Kalg
0 .LK.F// and Kalg
1 .LK.E// Š Kalg
1 .LK.F//.
(3) The graph E may turned into the graph F by ﬁnitely many applications of Moves
(S), (O), (I), (R), their inverses.
Moreover, in [18, §11] Ruiz and the author produce an example of graphs
E and F with ﬁnitely many vertices, inﬁnitely many edges, and having the

following properties: LQ.E/ and LQ.F/ are simple, Kalg
0 .LQ.E// Š Kalg
0 .LQ.F//,
Kalg
1 .LQ.E// Š Kalg
1 .LQ.F//, and Kalg
2 .LQ.E// 6Š Kalg
2 .LQ.F//. Thus the Kalg
0 -groups
and Kalg
1 -groups of LQ.E/ and LQ.F/ are isomorphic, but LQ.E/ and LQ.F/ are not
Morita equivalent. Hence the pair of the Kalg
0 -group and Kalg
1 -group can fail to be a
complete Morita equivalence invariant when the underlying ﬁeld is not a ﬁeld with
no free quotients.
This raises the question of whether higher algebraic K-groups can be included to
produce a complete Morita equivalence invariant for other ﬁelds. This was answered
afﬁrmatively for number ﬁelds in [10]. (Recall that a number ﬁeld is a ﬁeld that is a
ﬁnite extension of Q.) The following was proven in [10].
Theorem 6.4 (Gabe, Ruiz, Tomforde, and Whalen) Let K be a number ﬁeld, and
let E and F be graphs with a ﬁnite number of vertices and an inﬁnite number of
edges, and with the property that LK.E/ and LK.F/ are simple. Then the following
are equivalent:
(1) LK.E/ is Morita equivalent to LK.F/.
(2) Kalg
0 .LK.E// Š Kalg
0 .LK.F// and Kalg
6 .LK.E// Š Kalg
6 .LK.F//.
(3) The graph E may turned into the graph F by ﬁnitely many applications of Moves
(S), (O), (I), (R), their inverses.
This shows that the pair .Kalg
0 .LK.E//; Kalg
6 .LK.E/// is a complete Morita
equivalence invariant for these Leavitt path algebras when the ﬁeld is a number
ﬁeld. In addition, since Q is a number ﬁeld, this result covers the example produced
by Ruiz and the author in [18, §11].
The situation for other ﬁelds is unclear, and this leads us to an important open
question.
Open Question 2 Let K be a ﬁeld, and let E and F be graphs with a ﬁnite number
of vertices and an inﬁnite number of edges, and with the property that LK.E/ and
LK.F/ are simple. If Kalg
n .LK.E// Š Kalg
n .LK.F// for all n 2 N [ f0g, then is it the
case that LK.E/ is Morita equivalent to LK.F/?
In light of Theorem 6.1, Open Question 2 is equivalent to asking the following: “If
K is a ﬁeld and E is a graph with a ﬁnite number of vertices and an inﬁnite number
of edges, and for which LK.E/ is simple, then is it possible to determine jE0
singj from
the set of algebraic K-groups fKalg
n .LK.E// W n D 0; 1; 2 : : :g?”
Theorems 6.3 and 6.4 show that Open Question 2 has an afﬁrmative answer when
the ﬁeld either has no free quotients or is a number ﬁeld. This means that for simple
Leavitt path algebras over these ﬁelds the only missing part of a classiﬁcation is
to answer Open Question 1 and determine whether the sign of the determinant is a
Morita equivalence invariant in the case of ﬁnite graphs.
To obtain a classiﬁcation of all simple Leavitt path algebras by algebraic K-
theory, a positive answer to Open Question 2 is necessary. If the answer to
Question 2 is negative in general, then a general classiﬁcation in terms of algebraic
K-theory will not be possible and we will need to restrict our attention to Leavitt

path algebras over particular ﬁelds. Fortunately, for many ﬁelds of interest (e.g.,
C, R, ﬁnite ﬁelds, Q, number ﬁelds) we already know that Open Question 2 has a
positive answer.

Abstract This is a survey of recent progress in the structure and classiﬁcation
theory of nuclear C-algebras. In particular, I outline how the Universal Coefﬁcient
Theorem ensures a positive answer to the quasidiagonality question in the presence
of faithful traces. This has strong consequences for the regularity conjecture and
the classiﬁcation problem for separable, simple, nuclear C-algebras. Moreover, it
entails a positive solution to Rosenberg’s conjecture on quasidiagonality of reduced
C-algebras of discrete amenable groups. This note is largely based on a joint paper
with Aaron Tikuisis and Stuart White.

Introduction
Quasidiagonality was deﬁned by Halmos as an external ﬁnite dimensional approxi-
mation property for sets of operators on a Hilbert space [25]. Voiculescu studied the
notion as a property of (represented) C-algebras; cf. [56, 57].
For nuclear C-algebras quasidiagonality can be expressed as an embedding
property via the Choi–Effros lifting theorem [7]. Another connection to amenability
was disclosed by Hadwin in [24] and—in an appendix to the same paper—by
Rosenberg who observed that discrete group C-algebras can only be quasidiagonal
for amenable groups. The converse statement became known as Rosenberg’s
conjecture.
Elliott’s programme to classify nuclear C-algebras by K-theory data ﬁrst
featured quasidiagonality in the proof of Kirchberg’s embedding theorem [28]
(where it entered through Voiculescu’s homotopy invariance theorem [56]), which
then led up to the celebrated Kirchberg–Phillips classiﬁcation of simple, purely
inﬁnite, nuclear C-algebras; see [30, 44].
In the stably ﬁnite case, the relevance of quasidiagonality was ﬁrst marked by
Popa’s local quantisation of [42], which then inspired Lin to deﬁne TAF algebras,

thus leading up to the whole TAF/TAI classiﬁcation machinery (which recently
culminated in the spectacular [22] and [17] by Elliott, Gong, Lin, and Niu).
The quasidiagonality question (QDQ) of Blackadar and Kirchberg asks whether
all separable, stably ﬁnite, nuclear C-algebras are quasidiagonal; see [4]. In the
2000s, the interest in the interplay between quasidiagonality and nuclearity was
renewed in Brown’s [6] (which takes a measure theoretic or tracial point of view)
and in [32] (which establishes a further link to topological approximation properties
via the decomposition rank, a noncommutative covering dimension). The latter
notion was generalised to nuclear dimension in [63], and it became an intriguing
problem to characterise the difference between decomposition rank and nuclear
dimension.
A massive breakthrough was achieved by Matui and Sato in [36]: In the simple,
monotracial and Z-absorbing case (where Z denotes the Jiang–Su algebra from
[27]; see also [47]) quasidiagonality implies ﬁnite decomposition rank; in the
absence of quasidiagonality, by [49] one always has ﬁnite nuclear dimension.
For larger trace spaces, one has to consider Brown’s more reﬁned notion of
quasidiagonality of traces; cf. [5].
The latter condition also appears in [17] which amounts to the classiﬁcation
of all separable, unital, simple C-algebras with ﬁnite nuclear dimension, which
satisfy the Universal Coefﬁcient Theorem from [48] (UCT for short; satisfying it is
equivalent to being KK-equivalent to a commutative C-algebra) and for which all
traces are quasidiagonal. Although of stunning generality, the last two hypotheses
in this result do remain mysterious. The UCT holds for C-algebras of amenable
groupoids by [55] and is also ensured by a bootstrap type condition; therefore in
concrete situations of interest it can usually be conﬁrmed (see, for example, [15]).
To date it is unknown whether all separable nuclear C-algebras satisfy the UCT.
Quasidiagonality—due to its poor permanence properties—is usually also hard to
verify even in very concrete and geometric setups; see for example [40] or [34].
Remarkably, neither of these two problems occur in the von Neumann algebra
context of Connes’ celebrated classiﬁcation of injective factors (which remains an
inspiration for the classiﬁcation of nuclear C-algebras—at a philosophical, but also
at a technical level, since the various available proofs in [9, 23, 41] have revealed
important insights for C-algebraists).
The situation on the C-algebra side changed considerably with [51], in which
the two problems were linked to the effect that the UCT indeed ensures quasidi-
agonality under suitable circumstances, with the crucial extra tool being stable
uniqueness theorems as introduced in [11, 33]. The result veriﬁes Rosenberg’s
conjecture and has strong consequences for the structure and classiﬁcation of
simple nuclear C-algebras, including the regularity conjecture of Toms and myself
(see [18, 59]). In particular, the classiﬁcation of separable, unital, simple C-
algebras which satisfy the UCT and have ﬁnite nuclear dimension is now complete.
Moreover, the nuclear dimension hypothesis may be replaced by Z-absorption or
by strict comparison of positive elements, at least under additional conditions on
the space of tracial states.

QDQ vs. UCT
323
In this note I give a survey of the result, its proof and its corollaries. I try to
motivate it and put it into a larger context—especially in view of the remaining
open problems in the area—by specialising to the case of strongly self-absorbing
C-algebras.
In Sect. 2 I recall the concept of and some elementary facts about quasidiagonal-
ity. In Sect. 3 I state the stable uniqueness theorems and outline the role of the UCT
for the controlled version. Section 4 looks at strongly self-absorbing C-algebras
and approaches various versions of the quasidiagonality question from this point
of view. Section 5 contains the main result and its consequences for structure and
classiﬁcation of nuclear C-algebras and for Rosenberg’s conjecture. The proof of
the main theorem is outlined in Sect. 6. Finally, Sect. 7 collects a number of open
problems, mostly on quasidiagonality and on the UCT.
Most of the contents of the paper are based on [51], except for those of Sections 4
and 7 which have not previously been published in this form. I would like to thank
Ilijas Farah, David Kerr, Aaron Tikuisis, Stuart White and the referee for some very
helpful comments on an earlier version.

Quasidiagonality
2.1 Quasidiagonality was originally deﬁned by Halmos for sets of operators on
a Hilbert space; an abstract C-algebra is called quasidiagonal if it has a faithful
representation the image of which is quasidiagonal in this sense. For our purposes,
it will be useful to take Voiculescu’s characterisation from [56] as a deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition A C-algebra A is quasidiagonal if, for every ﬁnite subset F of A and
" > 0, there exist k 2 N and a completely positive contractive (c.p.c.) map  W A !
Mk such that
k .ab/   .a/ .b/k; kak  k .a/k < "
for all a; b 2 F.
2.2
With the aid of the Choi–Effros lifting theorem it is not hard to see that
for separable nuclear C-algebras quasidiagonality can be rephrased in terms of
embeddings into Q!, where Q is the universal UHF algebra, ! 2 ˇN n N is a free
ultraﬁlter, and Q! D Q
N Q=f.xn/N j limn!! xn D 0g.
Proposition A separable nuclear C-algebra A is quasidiagonal if and only if there
is an embedding A ,! Q!.

W. Winter
2.3 Remark Note that in this characterisation unitality is not an issue: A as above
is quasidiagonal if and only if the smallest unitisation A is quasidiagonal if and
only if there is a unital embedding A ,! Q!. (This last statement uses the fact
that Q is self-similar in the sense that every unital hereditary C-subalgebra of Q is
isomorphic to Q.)
2.4 Brown considered in [6] the reﬁned notion of quasidiagonal traces; this is based
on Voiculescu’s observation [57] that a unital, separable, quasidiagonal C-algebra
always has at least one tracial state which is picked up by a sequence of (unital)
quasidiagonal approximations as in Deﬁnition 2.1.
Deﬁnition A tracial state A 2 T.A/ on a C-algebra A is quasidiagonal if, for every
ﬁnite subset F of A and " > 0, there exist k 2 N and a c.p.c. map  W A ! Mk such
that
k .ab/   .a/ .b/k; jA.a/  Mk ı  .a/j < "
for all a; b 2 F.
2.5 Similar to Proposition 2.2, one can characterise quasidiagonality of traces in
terms of maps to Q!.
Proposition Let A be a separable nuclear C-algebra. A tracial state A 2 T.A/
is quasidiagonal if and only if there is a -homomorphism  W A ! Q! such that
A D Q! ı , where Q! is the unique tracial state on Q! given by Q!.Œ.xn/N/ D
limn!! Q.xn/.

Stable Uniqueness and the Universal Coefﬁcient Theorem
3.1
It is a common problem in classiﬁcation to decide when two morphisms
are (approximately unitarily) equivalent, provided there is no obvious K-theoretic
obstruction. Stable uniqueness theorems provide partial solutions by establishing
‘local almost’ unitary equivalences after adding the same map on both sides
with sufﬁciently large multiplicity. (Very roughly speaking, this could perhaps be
interpreted as a ﬁne-tuned version of Voiculescu’s theorem [58].) The problem has
been studied extensively by Lin (see [33], for example); for our purposes a version
of Dadarlat and Eilers—which we state here in a simpliﬁed form for brevity—will
be particularly useful.
Theorem [11, Theorem 4.5] Let C; B be unital C-algebras with C separable and
nuclear. Let  W C ! B be a unital -homomorphism which is totally full, i.e., for
every nonzero c 2 C the element .c/ generates B as an ideal. Let ';  W C ! B be
unital -homomorphisms with the same induced KK-class.

Then, for every ﬁnite subset G  C and ı > 0 there are n 2 N and a unitary
u 2 MnC1.B/ such that

c 2 G:
3.2 Remark For us it will be important that the domain algebra C in the theorem
above need not be simple. In fact, we will apply it to the unitisation of the suspension
of the algebra we are actually interested in. For the target we mostly care about the
algebra Q!; for technical reasons we also consider algebras like Q
N Q!.
3.3 For the proof of our main result, we need a reﬁned version of Theorem 3.1,
since for our method it is vital that n can be chosen independent of the speciﬁc
maps ';  and especially  (it may of course still depend on C, G and ı). Such
a result was already provided in [11, Theorem 4.12], at least for simple domains
C. However, the proof carries over to the nonsimple situation as long as one retains
some control over the fullness of . This is done in [51] in terms of a control function
 W C1
C n f0g ! N (where C1
C is the unit ball of the positive elements of C and
.c/ is the smallest k 2 N such that there are contractions x1; : : : ; xk 2 B with
1B D Pk
iD1 x
i .c/xi ). For a given -homomorphism  W C ! B one can deﬁne an (a
priori possibly inﬁnite) function  in terms of (inverses of) tracial values of .c/ for
c 2 C1
C n f0g; provided B has strict comparison of positive elements and the control
function remains ﬁnite, the map  will then be -full—see [51] for details.
The proof of [11, Theorem 4.12] works by assuming the statement is false and
then producing a sequence of pairs of counterexamples (i.e., pairs of maps as in
Theorem 3.1, but with no uniform bound on n) for contradiction. The crux is it to
assemble the two resulting sequences of maps into two single maps (with larger
target algebras) and at the same time keeping control over their KK-classes. In our
situation, the individual maps will be zero-homotopic,and the problem is it to decide
when maps of the form
KK

C; Q
N Bn

! Q
N KK.C; Bn/
(3.1)
are injective. The issue is that a sequence of homotopies doesn’t necessarily give rise
to a (continuous) homotopy of sequences, since the parameter speeds might increase
quickly. It is for this purpose—and for this purpose only—that the Universal
Coefﬁcient Theorem enters the stage.
3.4 Deﬁnition [48, Theorem 1.17], [3] A separable C-algebra A is said to satisfy
the Universal Coefﬁcient Theorem (UCT) if the sequence
0 ! Ext.K.A/; KC1.B// ! KK.A; B/ ! Hom.K.A/; K.B// ! 0
is exact for every -unital C-algebra B.
Both maps in the sequence above can be made explicit, using the natural
identiﬁcation KK.A; B/ Š Ext1.A; C0.R/ ˝ B ˝ K/: Given such an extension,

the right hand map collects the boundary maps of the associated six-term exact
sequence in K-theory. For trivial boundary maps, the six-term exact sequence splits
into two extensions of abelian groups; the UCT requires the left-hand map to be the
inverse of this assignment.
3.5 It is known that the separable C-algebras satisfying the UCT are precisely the
ones which are KK-equivalent to abelian C-algebras; see [48], [50, Proposition 5.3]
(or [3, Theorem 23.10.5]). The closure properties of the class of nuclear UCT C-
algebras are so strong that to date nobody has managed to ﬁnd a nuclear example
outside it. The UCT problem reads as follows.
Question Does every separable nuclear C-algebra satisfy the UCT?
3.6 In our situation, the UCT provides just enough information to make the map
of (3.1) injective; see [11] and [51] for details. Let us state the resulting ‘controlled’
stable uniqueness theorem, again for brevity in a simpliﬁed version. (See [51] for
the complete statement; this involves K-theory with coefﬁcients, which here boils
down to just ordinary K-theory by Q-stability.)
Theorem Let C be a separable, unital, nuclear C-algebra satisfying the UCT. Let
 W C1
C n f0g ! N be a control function, let G  C be a ﬁnite subset and let ı > 0.
Then there exists n 2 N such that for any unital -full -homomorphism  W C ! B

QDQ: A Strongly Self-Absorbing Point of View
4.1 The quasidiagonality question, also known as Blackadar–Kirchberg problem,
was posed in [4]:
QDQ
Is every separable, stably ﬁnite, nuclear C-algebra quasidiagonal?
Note that by Remark 2.3, QDQ is equivalent to QDQ1, the respective question for
unital C-algebras.
Likewise, one could add simplicity or both unitality and simplicity to the
hypotheses; we denote the resulting questions by QDQsimple and QDQsimple;1. At this
point I am not aware of any (but the obvious) formal implications between QDQ,
QDQsimple and QDQsimple;1, although it doesn’t seem unlikely that the general case
can be reduced to the simple situation (for example via some Bernoulli type crossed
product construction as in [39]?).
4.2 Although the quasidiagonality question has been around for a long time, until
recently its role for the structure and classiﬁcation theory of nuclear C-algebras has

QDQ vs. UCT
327
remained somewhat obscure, and its nature and complexity is still hard to gauge.
Maybe most conspicuously, it seems to be a very ﬁnite problem, in stark contrast
to other structural phenomena, which often exhibit a dichotomy between ﬁnite
and inﬁnite situations, such as the interplay between Lin’s TAF classiﬁcation and
Kirchberg–Phillips classiﬁcation, the roles of the Jiang–Su algebra Z and the Cuntz
algebra O1, and Toms’ and Rørdam’s topologically high-dimensional examples
[45, 52].
4.3
In order to shed some light on the quality of the problem, let us be more
restrictive and formulate the quasidiagonality question for strongly self-absorbing
C-algebras. These have been abstractly deﬁned in [53], but the concept goes back
to Effros–Rosenberg [16] in the C-algebra setting, which in turn was inspired by
the von Neumann algebra context where it was crucial for McDuff’s [38] and for
Connes’ celebrated classiﬁcation of injective factors [9].
4.4 Deﬁnition A separable unital C-algebra D ¤ C is strongly self-absorbing, if
there is an isomorphism ' W D ! D˝D which is approximately unitarily equivalent
to the ﬁrst factor embedding, i.e., there is a sequence of unitaries .un/N in D ˝ D
such that un.d ˝ 1D/u
n
n!1
! '.d/ for all d 2 D.
4.5 It was shown in [16] that strongly self-absorbing C-algebras are always simple
and nuclear; from results of Kirchberg it follows that they are either purely inﬁnite
or stably ﬁnite and in this case there is a unique tracial state (cf. [53]). By [60] they
are always Z-stable, i.e. they absorb Z tensorially.
4.6 For strongly self-absorbing C-algebras tensorial absorption can be charac-
terised in terms of (exact or approximate) unital embeddings: A separable unital
C-algebra A absorbs the strongly self-absorbing C-algebra D precisely if D
embeds unitally into the commutant of A inside its ultrapower, A! \A0 (the criterion
can also be phrased for nonunital A). The proof is based on an Elliott intertwining
argument; see [44, Theorem 7.2.2] or [53, Theorem 2.3] (these are stated for
sequence algebras instead of ultrapowers, but the proofs are essentially the same).
For a strongly self-absorbing target E, a separable subspace of the ultrapower E!
can be unitarily conjugated to a subspace of the relative commutant E! \ E0. As a
consequence, two strongly self-absorbing C-algebras D and E are isomorphic if
and only if there are unital embeddings D ,! E and E ,! D if and only if there are
unital embeddings D ,! E! and E ,! D!; see [16] and [53]. Upon combining this
with Proposition 2.2, we see that a (necessarily ﬁnite) strongly self-absorbing D is
quasidiagonal if and only if D˝Q Š Q. Moreover,Kirchberg’s embedding theorem
yields that O2 absorbs any other strongly self-absorbing C-algebra, O2 ˝D Š O2.
(This last statement holds in much greater generality.)
4.7 Examples The chart below contains all known strongly self-absorbing C-
algebras. Here, UHF1 stands collectively for UHF algebras of inﬁnite type. (The

328
W. Winter
universal UHF algebra Q is one of them; we list it separately to emphasise its role
as a ‘semiﬁnal’ object.) An arrow means ‘embeds unitally into’ or equivalently ‘is
tensorially absorbed by’.

Arguably the most important question about strongly self-absorbing C-algebras
is whether or not the list above is complete. This makes direct contact with
fundamental open problems such as the classiﬁcation problem, the Toms–Winter
conjecture, the UCT problem, or the quasidiagonality question. Even though being
strongly self-absorbing is a very restrictive condition, at this point there is no
evidence these questions will be substantially easier to answer when restricted to
the strongly self-absorbing situation. On the other hand, such a restriction can often
bare the problem of merely technical additional complications, and in this way
sometimes disclose its true nature. Occasionally, a solution in the strongly self-
absorbing case will then even give us a clue of how to deal with the general situation.
This has happened for example in the run-up to [49] and to [51]; it is one of the
reasons why I like to think of strongly self-absorbing C-algebras as a microcosm
within the world of all nuclear C-algebras.
4.8 It is a crucial feature of the point of view above that questions on the existence
or non-existence of examples with certain properties can be rephrased in terms of
abstract characterisations of the known examples. For instance, the Jiang–Su algebra
Z was characterised in [60] as the uniquely determined initial object in the category
of all strongly self-absorbing C-algebras. (An object in a category is initial, if there
is a morphism to every other object. Very often this morphism is also required to
be unique; in our situation, this will be the case when using approximate unitary
equivalence classes instead of just unital -homomorphisms.) At the opposite
end, O2 is the unique ﬁnal object (i.e., there is a morphism from every other
object to O2; as above, this will be unique when using as morphisms approximate
unitary equivalence classes of unital -homomorphisms) by Kirchberg’s embedding
theorem. These are, as Kirchberg once put it, sociological characterisations, based

QDQ vs. UCT
329
on interactions with peer objects. In [12], it was observed that O2 can also be
characterised intrinsically—or genetically—as the unique strongly self-absorbing
C-algebra with trivial K0-group. Conspicuously, this characterisation of the ﬁnal
object does not require the UCT; in contrast, Kirchberg has shown that the UCT
problem is in fact equivalent to the question whether a unital Kirchberg algebra with
trivial K-theory is isomorphic to O2 [29], and Dadarlat has a parallel result featuring
Q [10]. It is tempting to think of Q and Q ˝ O1 in a similar way, as ‘semiﬁnal’
objects: Q is ﬁnal in the category of all known ﬁnite strongly self-absorbing C-
algebras, and, more abstractly, also in the category of all quasidiagonal strongly
self-absorbing C-algebras (cf. [16]). One can now turn the tables and interpret this
fact as a characterisation of quasidiagonality for strongly self-absorbing C-algebras
in terms of its ﬁnal object. Similarly, Q˝O1 is the ﬁnal object in the category of all
known strongly self-absorbing C-algebras which are not O2. Turning tables again
one can look at the category of all strongly self-absorbing C-algebras which embed
unitally into Q ˝ O1 and interpret this as a notion of quasidiagonality which also
makes sense in the inﬁnite setting, at least in the strongly self-absorbing context.
4.9
The strongly self-absorbing version of the quasidiagonality question reads:
Is every ﬁnite strongly self-absorbing C-algebra quasidiagonal? In view of the
preceding discussion, we obtain an equivalent formulation as follows:
QDQﬁnite s:s:a:
Is D ˝ Q Š Q for every ﬁnite strongly self-absorbing C-algebra
D?
Note that this asks whether Q can be characterised abstractly as the ﬁnal object in
the category of ﬁnite strongly self-absorbing C-algebras. In the above one could
specialise even a bit more and require the ordered K0-group of D to be a subgroup
of Q (with natural order).
4.10 Unlike the original quasidiagonality question, the version of 4.9 yields an
obvious inﬁnite counterpart by simply replacing Q with Q ˝ O1 and ‘ﬁnite’ with
the minimal necessary condition ‘not isomorphic to O2’:
QDQinﬁnite s:s:a:
Is D ˝ Q ˝ O1 Š Q ˝ O1 for every strongly self-absorbing
C-algebra D not isomorphic to O2?
Once again this asks for an abstract characterisation of Q ˝ O1 as the ﬁnal object
in the category of all strongly self-absorbing C-algebras which are not O2 (or
equivalently, which have nontrivial K-theory).
This inﬁnite (or rather, general) version of the strongly self-absorbing quasidi-
agonality question runs completely parallel with its ﬁnite antagonist, and may be
taken as ﬁrst evidence that the original quasidiagonality question is just the ﬁnite
incarnation of a much more general type of embedding problem.
4.11
We have now used a tool from classiﬁcation—Elliott’s intertwining argu-
ment—to rephrase the quasidiagonality question as an isomorphism problem, which
makes sense both in a ﬁnite and an inﬁnite context. Going only one step further, we

330
W. Winter
see that classiﬁcation not only predicts, but in fact provides, a positive answer to
QDQinﬁnite s:s:a:: The secret extra ingredient is to assume that D satisﬁes the UCT.
Under this hypothesis, it was observed in [53] that the K-theory of D has to agree
with that of one of the known strongly self-absorbing examples, and then it follows
from Kirchberg–Phillips classiﬁcation that D is indeed absorbed by Q ˝ O1. We
therefore have:
Theorem If D ¤ O2 is a strongly self-absorbing C-algebra which satisﬁes the
UCT, then D ˝ Q ˝ O1 Š Q ˝ O1.
In other words, Q ˝ O1 is the unique ﬁnal object in the category of strongly
self-absorbing C-algebras which have nontrivial K-theory and satisfy the UCT.
With this observation at hand, I found it harder and harder to imagine QDQﬁnite s:s:a:
fails when also assuming the UCT. Now we know this perception was indeed correct
(cf. 5.6 below), even in a generality going far beyond the strongly self-absorbing
context (see 5.2). Here I took the strongly self-absorbing perspective mostly for a
cleaner picture of a simpler situation—but with the beneﬁt of hindsight, the theorem
above provided just the necessary impetus to combine the quasidiagonality question
with the UCT problem.
5
The Main Result: Structure and Classiﬁcation
5.1 Theorem [51, Theorem A] Let A be a separable nuclear C-algebra which
satisﬁes the UCT. Then every faithful trace on A is quasidiagonal.
Short after the distribution of [51], Gabe observed in [19] that essentially the
same argument works when weakening the nuclearity hypotheses to A being exact
and the trace being amenable. Before outlining the proof of the theorem above let
us list some consequences, mostly for the structure and classiﬁcation of simple C-
algebras, but also for Rosenberg’s conjecture.
5.2
Corollary [51, Corollary B] Every separable nuclear C-algebra which
satisﬁes the UCT and has a faithful trace is quasidiagonal. In particular, the
quasidiagonality question has a positive answer for simple unital C-algebras
satisfying the UCT.
5.3 In the appendix of [24], Rosenberg observed that for a discrete group G, if the
reduced group C-algebra C
r .G/ is quasidiagonal then G is amenable. The converse
was Rosenberg’s conjecture, open since the 1980s. Our result in conjunction with
[55] (which veriﬁes the UCT assumption) conﬁrms the conjecture (the canonical
trace on C
r .G/ is well-known to be faithful). Together with Rosenberg’s earlier
result this yields a new characterisation of amenability for discrete groups. Note
that at ﬁrst glance our result seems to only cover countable discrete groups

QDQ vs. UCT
331
(Theorem 5.1 deals with separable C-algebras), but the general case follows since
both quasidiagonality and amenability are local conditions.
Corollary [51, Corollary C] For a discrete amenable group G, its reduced group
C-algebra C
r .G/ is quasidiagonal.
5.4 Elliott, Gong, Lin and Niu have very recently (see [17], which heavily uses [22])
obtained a spectacular classiﬁcation result for unital simple nuclear C-algebras—
the crucial additional assumptions being ﬁnite decomposition rank and the UCT.
They also show that ﬁnite decomposition rank may be weakened to ﬁnite nuclear
dimension, provided all traces are quasidiagonal. Our Theorem 5.1 now shows that
this last hypothesis is in fact redundant. This is important for applications, since
ﬁnite nuclear dimension is notoriously easier to verify than ﬁnite decomposition
rank, but it is also very satisfactory from a conceptual point of view, since for once
it allows to state the purely inﬁnite and the stably ﬁnite incarnations of classiﬁcation
in the same framework—and it also shows that quasidiagonality of traces precisely
marks the dividing line between nuclear dimension and decomposition rank (at least
in the simple UCT case), thus answering [63, Question 9.1] in this context.
Corollary [51, Corollary D] The class of all separable, unital, simple, inﬁnite
dimensional C-algebras with ﬁnite nuclear dimension and which satisfy the UCT
is classiﬁed by the Elliott invariant.
5.5 It is worth highlighting the special case when there is at most one trace. For
once, the statement becomes particularly clean then, partly because the classifying
invariant reduces to just ordered K-theory in this situation, and moreover the proof
only relies on work that has already been published (apart from [51]). The traceless
case has been known for a long time—it is the by now classical Kirchberg–Phillips
classiﬁcation of purely inﬁnite C-algebras. The equivalence of conditions (i), (ii)
and (iii) below in the tracial case is the culmination of [46, 61, 35, 49] and does not
require the UCT; this only comes in to make the connection with (i’).
Corollary [51, Corollaries E and 6.4] The full Toms–Winter conjecture holds for
C-algebras with at most one trace and which satisfy the UCT.
That is, for a separable, unital, simple, inﬁnite dimensional, nuclear C-algebra
A with at most one trace and with the UCT, the following are equivalent:
(i) A has ﬁnite nuclear dimension.
(ii) A is Z-stable.
(iii) A has strict comparison of positive elements.
If A is stably ﬁnite, then (i) may be replaced by
(i’) A has ﬁnite decomposition rank.
Moreover, this class is classiﬁed up to Z-stability by ordered K-theory.

332
W. Winter
5.6 Since strongly self-absorbing C-algebras are Z-stable by [60] and have at
most one trace, we now know that the chart of 4.7 is indeed complete within the
UCT class.
Corollary The strongly self-absorbing C-algebras satisfying the UCT are pre-
cisely the known ones.

A Sketch of a Proof
6.1 In this outline of the proof of Theorem 5.1 I freely assume A to be unital, since
one can easily reduce to this case. The very rough idea of the argument is it to
produce two complementary cones over A and ‘connect’ them along the interval in
order to construct an almost multiplicative map from C.Œ0; 1/ ˝ A to M2.Q!/.
6.2 Let us begin by producing two cones over A in Q! such that at least their
scalar parts are compatible. In order to conjure up a single cone over A inside
Q! one might try to employ Voiculescu’s theorem [56] on homotopy invariance
of quasidiagonality, which will immediately yield an embedding of the cone over A
into Q!. However, this method will typically give an embedding which is small in
trace (not surprisingly, since Voiculescu’s result works in complete generality, even
when there are no traces around at all). For us this means that we won’t be able
to repeat the step in order to ﬁnd the complementary second cone. Instead, we will
need a more reﬁned way of implementing quasidiagonality of cones. We will do this
by carefully controlling tracial information for the embedding C0..0; 1; A/ ,! Q!.
Roughly speaking, we want the canonical trace on Q! to be compatible with
a prescribed trace on A and with Lebesgue measure on the interval. This was
essentially laid out in [49] and reﬁned in [51]; it heavily relies on Connes’ [9] and
also uses Kirchberg and Rørdam’s [31].
Lemma Let A be a separable, unital, nuclear C-algebra and let A 2 T.A/ be a
tracial state.
(i) There is a -homomorphism

We use  Lebesgue to denote the traces induced by Lebesgue measure on C.Œ0; 1/
and on the two cones C0..0; 1/ and C0.Œ0; 1//.
Idea of Proof
(i) This is essentially contained in [49]. For simplicity let us assume the trace A
is extremal, so that the weak closure of the GNS representation of A is a ﬁnite
injective factor. We therefore obtain a unital -homomorphism A ! R  R!
which picks up the trace A when composed with the canonical trace on R!.
By Kaplansky’s density theorem Q! surjects onto R!, when dividing out the
trace kernel ideal fx 2 Q! j Q!.xx/ D 0g C Q!. By the Choi–Effros
lifting theorem, there is a c.p.c. lift from A to Q!. The ‘curvature’ of this
map (the defect of it being multiplicative) then lies in the trace kernel ideal
of Q!, and one can use a quasicentral approximate unit in conjunction with a
reindexing argument to replace it by a c.p.c. order zero lift. (Alternatively, one
can use Kirchberg’s "-test from [31] in place of reindexing.) This order zero
map corresponds to a -homomorphism 	 deﬁned on the cone over A which
will have the right properties.
(ii) Find a -homomorphism  W C0..0; 1/ ! Q such that Q ı D  Lebesgue. Next,
ﬁnd a unital copy of Q in Q! \ 	.C0..0; 1/ ˝ A/0. We compose this inclusion
with  and tensor with 	 to obtain a -homomorphism
e	 W C0..0; 1/ ˝ C0..0; 1/ ˝ A ! Q!:
Since C0..0; 1/ is the universal C-algebra generated by a positive contraction,
the assignment id.0;1 ˝ a 7! id.0;1 ˝ id.0;1 ˝ a induces a -homomorphism;
we deﬁne K˚ to be the composition with e	.
Next observe that the two cones in Q! generated by the elements K˚.id.0;1 ˝
1A/ and 1Q!  K˚.id.0;1 ˝ 1A/ carry the same Cuntz semigroup information
(which is determined by Lebesgue measure on the interval), and are therefore
unitarily equivalent by [8] (and reindexing), i.e., 1Q!  K˚.id.0;1 ˝ 1A/ D
w K˚.id.0;1 ˝ 1A/ w for some unitary w 2 Q!. Deﬁne J˚ to be the resulting

conjugate of K˚, so that J˚..1idŒ0;1//˝a/ D w K˚.id.0;1˝a/w, a 2 A. The map
 is then ﬁxed by these data since J˚..1idŒ0;1//˝1A/C K˚.id.0;1˝1A/ D 1Q!.
6.3 Now we have produced two cones over A inside Q!; the scalar parts of these ﬁt
nicely together, but the A-valued components might be in general position. The task
is to join them in order to ﬁnd a c.p.c. map from C.Œ0; 1/ ˝ A to (matrices over) Q!
which is either exactly or at least approximately multiplicative. We wish to establish
this connection by comparing the two restrictions to the suspension over A,
K WD K˚jC0..0;1//˝A W C0..0; 1// ˝ A ! Q!
and
J WD J˚jC0..0;1//˝A W C0..0; 1// ˝ A ! Q!:
Here’s what would make this work. It’s not quite going to, but it is a blueprint of the
actual proof, and it isolates the necessary ingredients.
Lemma In the setting above, suppose there is a unitary u 2 Q! such that
J. : / D u K. : / u:
(6.1)
Then, there is a -homomorphism
˚ W A ! M2.Q!/
such that

In particular, the unital -homomorphism
e˚ W A
˚
! ˚.1A/ M2.Q!/ ˚.1A/ Š Q!
shows that the trace A is quasidiagonal.
Proof We write down the map ˚ explicitly. Deﬁne a partition of unity of piecewise
linear positive continuous functions h0; h1=2; h1 on the interval so that h0 equals 1 at
0, and is 0 on Œ1=4; 1; h1 is just h0 reﬂected at 1=2. Consider a continuous rotation

Let .2/ W M2.C.Œ0; 1// ! M2.Q!/ denote the ampliﬁcation of  to 22 matrices.
We may then deﬁne a c.p. map by setting

for a 2 A; it is not hard to check that ˚ is in fact multiplicative and picks up half of
the trace A as claimed in the lemma.
For the last statement note that ˚ is unital when regarded as a -homomorphism
to the hereditary C-subalgebra generated by its image, ˚.1A/ M2.Q!/ ˚.1A/,
which is isomorphic to Q! since Q is self-similar; cf. Remark 2.3. Under this
identiﬁcation the traces 2  .trM2 ˝ Q!/j˚.1A/ M2.Q!/ ˚.1A/ and Q! agree since Q!
is monotracial by [37, Lemma 4.7], so that A D Q! ı e˚ is quasidiagonal by
Proposition 2.5.
6.4 Remarks
(i) If one only had an approximate version of (6.1) the same argument would yield
an approximately multiplicative c.p.c. map ˚; after reindexing this would still
be good enough to prove quasidiagonality.
(ii) It is natural to ask whether the use of 22 matrices is really essential here. One
could certainly hide the matrices by rotating and compressing everything into
the upper left corner—but that’s a red herring since one cannot necessarily force
the resulting map to be unital. The reason is that the method above allows only
limited control over K-theory, and one cannot guarantee that ˚.1A/ is Murray–
von Neumann equivalent to e11 ˝ 1Q! (of course the two agree tracially, but
that’s not enough in ultrapowers, even of UHF algebras).
6.5 In general, unitary equivalence of the two suspensions as in (6.1) seems too
much to ask for—and the same goes for approximate versions. On the other hand,
it’s not completely outrageous either; for example, it is not too hard to see that when
A happens to be strongly self-absorbing then the converse of Lemma 6.3 holds, i.e.,
unitary equivalence of the two suspensions is implied by quasidiagonality. More
can be said using [5], but whether this kind of unitary equivalence is a necessary
condition for quasidiagonality in complete generality is not clear, and we don’t have
means to check it directly. The way around this is the stable uniqueness machinery
as introduced by Lin in [33], then reﬁned by Dadarlat–Eilers in [11] and since often
used and further reﬁned by Elliott, Gong, Lin, Niu, and others.

W. Winter
6.6 Let us revisit Lemma 6.3 and replace the critical hypothesis (6.1) by a weaker
one (still not quite weak enough for us to conﬁrm it in sufﬁcient generality, but now
almost within reach):
9 n 2 N; u; v 2 U.MnC1.Q!// such that
J ˚ J˚n D u
	
K ˚ J˚n
u
and
J ˚ K˚n D v
	
K ˚ K˚n
v:
(6.2)
Then we can chop the interval which sits via  inside Q! Š M2n ˝ Q! into small
pieces and apply the idea of the proof of Lemma 6.3 2n times along the interval (we
have to switch from u to v halfway, which is why we have to use 2n intervals, not
just n); diagrammatically we end up with the following picture; cf. [51, Figure 1]:
This will produce a -homomorphism
˚ W A ! M2 ˝ M2n ˝ Q!
in a similar way as in Lemma 6.3, which again entails quasidiagonality.
6.7 Just as in Remark 6.4(i), it would be enough to come up with an approximately
multiplicative c.p.c. map ˚, which would follow from an approximate version
of (6.2). The latter is very close to the conclusion of Theorem 3.1, with J and K in
place of ' and  , respectively, and also with J and K in place of . However, there
is a catch: The maps in the diagrammatic chart of 6.6 are in fact not the original
maps J or K; rather, they are restrictions of those maps to small subintervals of
.0; 1/. This makes a difference, since it means that the maps depend on the number
of intervals, hence on n, which in Theorem 3.1 in turn depends on the maps—and
the whole affair becomes circular! Luckily, there is a backdoor: In the controlled
stable uniqueness theorem 3.6 the number n does not depend on the actual maps; it
only depends (except for G and ı, of course) on the control function  which is tied
to the Lebesgue measure on the interval via the prescribed trace and the map . The
price for this additional control is the UCT hypothesis in Theorem 5.1.

QDQ vs. UCT

Some Open Problems
7.1 Of course the main problems in the context of this paper are the UCT problem
and the quasidiagonality question in its various versions as discussed in Sect. 4.
These are expected to be hard; the problems listed below aim to highlight their
interplay and to break them up into smaller bits and pieces which will hopefully be
easier to attack.
7.2 Question Are there formal implications between the versions of the quasidiag-
onality question from Sect. 4? In other words, can we prove any of the implications
[QDQinﬁnite s:s:a: holds] ” [QDQﬁnite s:s:a: holds] H) [QDQsimple;1 holds] H)
[QDQsimple holds] H) [QDQ holds]?
7.3 By Corollary 5.2, the UCT implies quasidiagonality under suitable conditions,
and one can ask under which hypotheses there is a converse. This is also interesting
for special cases:
Questions Does every quasidiagonal strongly self-absorbing C-algebra satisfy the
UCT? What about strongly self-absorbing C-subalgebras of Q ˝ O1? Or unital,
simple, nuclear and monotracial C-subalgebras of Z?
7.4 Kirchberg has reduced the UCT problem to the simple case; even more, the
problem is equivalent to the question whether O2 is the only unital Kirchberg
algebra with trivial K-theory (see [29, 2.17]). As discussed in 4.8, for strongly self-
absorbing C-algebras the answer is known. From this point of view the following
does not seem likely, but I still think it is worth asking.
Question Can the UCT problem be reduced to the strongly self-absorbing case?
7.5 It was shown in [53] that the K-theory of a strongly self-absorbing C-algebra
satisfying the UCT has to agree with the K-theory of one of the known strongly self-
absorbing examples. However, the proof really only requires the formally weaker
Künneth Theorem for tensor products (see [48]), and one may ask whether even
this can be made redundant, or whether there are at least some restrictions on
the possible K-groups. For example, Dadarlat pointed out that for a quasidiagonal
strongly self-absorbing D, K1.D/ cannot have an inﬁnite cyclic subgroup (again by
the Künneth Theorem and since in this case D ˝ Q Š Q).
Questions If D is a strongly self-absorbing C-algebra, does K1.D/ have to be
trivial? Does K.D/ have to be torsion free?
7.6
It is a classical question when a C-algebra is isomorphic to its opposite.
Whenever one expects classiﬁcation by K-theory data the answer should be
positive, and it certainly is for strongly self-absorbing C-algebras with UCT; see

338
W. Winter
Corollary 5.6 (note that the opposite of a strongly self-absorbing C-algebra is again
strongly self-absorbing).
Question Is a strongly self-absorbing D isomorphic to its opposite Dop?
7.7 The following stems essentially from [6].
Questions For a separable unital C-algebra A, do the quasidiagonal traces form a
face? If, in addition, A is quasidiagonal, are all traces quasidiagonal? Do nuclearity
of A or amenability of the traces make a difference?
Together with a result from [6], [51, Corollary 6.1] yields a positive answer to the
second question when also assuming nuclearity and the UCT.
7.8
In both [39] and [51], quasidiagonality of amenable group C-algebras is
derived abstractly from classiﬁcation techniques—but at this point there is no way
to construct quasidiagonalising ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces of `2.G/ explicitly.
Question Is there a group theoretic / dynamic proof of Rosenberg’s conjecture?
7.9 C-algebras of amenable groups are almost never simple—but they have simple
quotients, and one may ask when these are classiﬁable. There is by now a range of
very convincing results along these lines; cf. [14, 15].
Question When are simple quotients of amenable group C-algebras classiﬁable?
When can one at least show Z-stability?
7.10 In a similar vein, one can look at topological dynamical systems, where free
and minimal actions typically yield simple C-crossed products. These algebras
tend to be nuclear provided the groups—or at least their actions—are amenable;
cf. [1, 54]. We know from [20] that one cannot expect regularity in general, and
that conditions on the dimension of the underlying space (or again the action) are
essential to guarantee Z-stability or ﬁnite nuclear dimension of the crossed product.
Recent results of Kerr, however, together with the tiling result of [13], suggest that
we might be only a stone’s throw away from an answer to the following:
Question
For free minimal actions of countable discrete amenable groups on
Cantor sets, are the crossed product C-algebras classiﬁable?
The setup is shockingly general: free minimal Cantor actions of amenable groups!
So how are we even entitled to ask this? Quasidiagonality of the crossed product
is given by our Theorem 5.1 in connection with [55], which veriﬁes the UCT. Z-
stability seems now within reach with Kerr’s techniques on tiling (based on [13])
together with Archey and Phillips’ large subalgebra approach [2] or, alternatively,
using the idea of dynamic dimension and dynamic Z-stability as deﬁned by the

QDQ vs. UCT
339
author (yet unpublished, but closely related to the notion of Rokhlin dimension
from [26]). From here only ﬁnite nuclear dimension of the crossed product would
be missing to arrive at classiﬁability (by [17] via [62]; for a slightly more direct
approach in the uniquely ergodic case see [49]). In the case when the ergodic
measures form a compact space, ﬁnite nuclear dimension follows from Z-stability
by [5].
Here is an even more general—though not necessarily more daring—layout.
Questions For free minimal actions of countable discrete amenable groups on ﬁnite
dimensional spaces, are the crossed product C-algebras classiﬁable? What about
amenable actions of countable discrete groups?
The following rigidity question was beautifully answered for Cantor minimal Z-
actions in [21] in terms of strong orbit equivalence. In the situation of amenable
group actions, it seems much more speculative, and one can only expect a less
complete answer. If one is prepared to go beyond the context of amenable group
actions, Popa’s rigidity theory for von Neumann algebras (cf. [43]) is extremely
encouraging—but on the C-algebra side one would have to change the game
completely and develop most of the technology from scratch.
Question To what extent are topological dynamical systems determined by their
associated C-algebras?
