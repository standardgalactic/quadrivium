Introduction
If you have ever been inside an MRI scanner, had a vaccination, flown in an 
airplane powered by rocket fuel, or used the seatbelt in your car, then you 
have experienced the benefits of university research. Thousands of products 
used every day have sprung to life out of university research labs. But in 
recent years, when it comes to leadership in innovation, universities have 
ceded the limelight to the private sector. Although much university research 
is still potentially useful, it rarely sees the light of day beyond publication in 
a scientific journal. Most of the patents held in university patent portfolios 
never earn a cent in revenue. Only a tiny minority of researchers will ever 
run their own company and apply the technologies they have so passionately 
invented. What does this disconnect stem from? Often from a lack of 
information about how to turn ideas into startups to make an impact.
Startup entrepreneurship is a learning experience that encompasses 
disciplines outside of your domain. It is a mindset, not a job. With that 
mindset, you should embrace the opportunity to integrate new skills into 
your life. You may discover a new talent you never knew you had. Starting 
a company sounds difficult, but the alternative, working in a corporation, is 
no cakewalk either. Few big corporations innovate. Climbing the ranks from 
the ground up often takes decades and is fraught with politics. Doing a good 
job and trying to be inventive will not help you to advance in the corporate 
environment. This leaves creative people frustrated. However, when joining 
a big corporation as an accomplished entrepreneur, your chances are much 
better. I know several founders who sold their startups to large companies. 
For them, entrepreneurship was the fast track to an executive position in a 
larger corporation. 
Startup entrepreneurship is a huge advantage on your resume. You will gain 
diverse knowledge unlike that from any other project you have undertaken so 
far. After all, life is short. Wouldn’t it make sense to explore all the possibilities 
before committing to a line of work in which you spend 60% of your waking 
hours? I encourage everyone to give entrepreneurship a try. The guidelines 
in this book will enrich your experience and give you the tools to make the 
most of your ideas. You will gain a wealth of diverse knowledge by launching 
a startup. When you work in your own company instead of somebody else’s, 
you will learn the ropes of doing business and making an impact much faster 
(see Figure 1). This makes up for the long hours spent trying to get it off the 
ground. You will be able to draw on this throughout your life.

Who Is This Book For?
The first part of this book speaks directly to students and researchers 
who are interested in launching a startup or spin-off. In a nutshell, this is 
about showing founders how they can use the existing university system as 
a springboard for entrepreneurship, make the best of existing synergies, and 
sidestep all the ballast not conducive to startup success. The strategies are 
of course also useful for entrepreneurs venturing out on their own without 
an academic support system. 
I do not examine the topic academically. Much has been written elsewhere 
about the commercialization of university patents and the complexities 
of public programs to stimulate entrepreneurship. It is also not my intent 
to suggest sweeping reforms to the education system to make it more 
entrepreneurial. But if you are studying, researching, or teaching at a university 
and are thinking about entrepreneurship, this book is for you. It contains 
practical advice that I find useful in launching a company, mostly based on my 
personal experience. All startups and entrepreneurs are unique, and I do not 
claim to have all the answers. Nevertheless, I introduce some unconventional 
ideas and approaches here that you may find useful in your own endeavors 
as an entrepreneur.
The second part of the book concentrates on universities. You may find 
yourself in a position where you wonder how the current system could 
better help foster startups and entrepreneurship. There are numerous 
opinions about how this should be done. However, a relatively conservative 
organization like a university cannot be turned on its head overnight with 
a sweeping reform. Yet there exists a growing desire among universities to 
redefine their relationship with the market and other external stakeholders. 
Making an impact with research beyond scientific publications occupies 
more and more mindshare. By understanding how the startup process 
works, universities can leverage their existing resources to help students 
and researchers launch companies with more impact.

Many of those ideas and approaches run contrary to what your startup 
advisors will tell you. This book may advocate that you do the opposite of 
what you read in the university’s official startup publication or in popular 
books about startups. It may even suggest that you forget what you just 
learned in a Guru workshop about entrepreneurship. Some of the ideas 
may seem overly opportunistic to you, especially if you have never been 
exposed to entrepreneurship before. Launching a startup is by definition 
opportunistic. If there is a chance, then take it. If there is none, then make 
one. Nobody will make your life work for you. You need to take matters into 
your own hands and take full responsibility for your destiny. This is one of the 
prevailing themes of this book.
What Will You Learn in This Book?
Launching a startup is not rocket science. Regardless, there are a few strategies 
and skills that founders must know to have a real chance at success. Putting 
together an entrepreneurship program at a university has much in common 
with launching a startup. So the strategies outlined in the first part of the 
book are just as useful for those who implement entrepreneurial programs 
in the curricula of universities. The overview in Figure 2 groups the book’s

While you read, I encourage you to keep an open mind. Look at 
entrepreneurship as a process—an ongoing learning experience. It is in many 
ways more a mindset than a job, which may confuse you at times. There 
will be much conflict ahead. Armed with some basic tools, you will come to 
understand what it means to launch a startup. You will be in a position to 
analyze your challenges, break them down into manageable parts, and move 
them toward solutions quickly. Even though the end goal of your startup may 
still be uncertain, you will have a guide that explains the next steps. 
All this comes not from a theoretical source, but from a battle-hardened 
practitioner who has walked this walk before: seven times, to be exact, as of 
this writing. That being said, do not take any of this as gospel. This is simply 
a collection of concepts I find helpful in getting a company off the ground in 
a relatively short time, with limited resources. 
I wish I had a sure-fire recipe to create a successful company, but I don’t. 
Many turtles hatch, but few make it to the sea. Achieving startup success 
remains elusive. A whopping 93% of companies backed by Silicon Valley–based 
accelerator Y Combinator fail.1 Mind you, these are the 2% of handpicked 
companies that were selected to enter a 90-day entrepreneurship crash 
course in the startup capital of the world. Startups fail despite the best efforts 
of an army of talented venture capitalists, consultants, and the entrepreneurs 
themselves, who often display incredible drive to make their company work. 
There is no shame in failure. But if you and your startup arm yourselves with 
practical tools that entrepreneurs around the world have successfully used, 
the odds of graduating to the successful 7% have just increased. 
With slight upgrades, universities and their startups can improve their 
chances of entrepreneurial success significantly. This requires effort from 
all stakeholders in the startup equation—not just from the government and 
universities, but first and foremost from the entrepreneurs themselves. If 
one thing is obvious, it is that entrepreneurship is hardly a theoretical school 
of thought, but a hands-on exercise. With this in mind, let’s begin.

Strategies for 
University 
Startup 
Entrepreneurs
When did you choose to become an entrepreneur? In early childhood, or just 
yesterday? Or are you still on the fence? Whatever the case, you should have 
some idea about what it is like to start your own business before you take the 
plunge—an idea based on the entrepreneurial experience of someone who 
has done this before.
If you study or do research at a university, take a step back and observe your 
environment from 50,000 feet in the air. You see a fail-safe system where 
you acquire deep knowledge without much distraction. It does not matter 
whether the economy is in a boom or in a slump; learning always has priority. 
Now think about what this environment could do for you as a startup entre-
preneur. You have a strong community, an excellent network, diversity of ideas 
and opinions, fully equipped workshops and labs, and tech support at your 
disposal—all for free. Your university may have a strong reputation. It may 
attract powerful external parties such as governments and corporations that 
want to be involved in one form or another. All these advantages are unique, 
and they exist only for students and researchers. In this walled garden, you can

test and experiment. If you fail, there is almost no consequence. Companies 
seldom have such luxury. University startups have a leg up on anyone else. 
When you know how to use this environment to your benefit, you can  
compete with companies anywhere in the world from a strong base that 
supports you all the way. Why not give it a shot and make the most of your 
university experience?
Most of the time, your university or government will have some startup advice 
for you. This is the conventional advice that others have diligently followed: 
apply for this or that grant, participate in the business-plan competition, and 
get some MBA students from another faculty to create a business model for 
you. The startup consultant from the university or the government has never 
launched a startup, so how can they be experts to guide you toward success? 
Out of ignorance about what entrepreneurship really entails, startups give 
away much of the control over their destiny.
Part 1 of this book will empower you with actual, practical steps that you can 
apply today. Of course, this is no guarantee that your venture will succeed. 
Nevertheless, it is much better than having no clue about how to begin, in the 
process relying on non-entrepreneurs to call the shots for you. I have included 
a few episodes from my own startup journey. They have little in common 
with the success stories you would read in a Donald Trump book, but they 
paint a picture of what most entrepreneurs may go through to eventually turn 
their companies profitable. To make the point that successful startups are not  
created overnight, let me recount how my first company came to pass in a 
little more detail.
When I started out as an entrepreneur, I had the odds stacked firmly against 
me. Nobody from my family had ever started their own business. None of 
my friends had, either. Because I thought I wanted to be a medical doctor 
from a very young age, I never seriously looked at any other professions.  
Not only that, I never investigated what it really meant to be employed in a 
hospital. After the first year at medical school, I terminated my studies with 
the vague idea of doing something with the Internet and multimedia. All of my 
old friends from school reacted to the decision with disbelief and criticism. 
The same was the case with the new friends I had made during my freshman 
year. Nobody could quite understand why this guy was dissatisfied with what 
worked so well for them. Why did he decide to give it all up to try to do the 
impossible? My parents were obviously less than thrilled when they heard of 
my latest plans. They were not particularly supportive of this new direction, 
yet they had no other choice than to let me try.
Because I was not independently wealthy, I had to take on some humbling, 
menial jobs—just menial enough that I had enough time to develop my vision 
and skill set in my free time. The first was part-time work as an usher in a movie 
theatre. Occasionally some old classmates would see me vacuuming popcorn 
from the floor; they must have chuckled at the sight of the valedictorian of 

their class from the prestigious high school, the former medical student, who 
was now laboring side by side with shady characters, some of whom you would 
rather not face at night in a dark alley. This was a difficult time, no doubt. But in 
retrospect, it was an essential test of my dedication to make it work.
With the little money I had saved, I bought a desktop computer and picked 
up some programming on my own. After a brief stint at a copy shop (where I 
learned to use Adobe Photoshop), I took a part-time job at a TV station (where 
I learned about marketing and using multimedia software). A few more inter-
ludes followed, most of them hardly worth recounting. However, after about 
a year, I felt I had enough knowledge to launch my first startup. The Internet 
was just beginning to take off, and there was a fast-growing demand for flash 
web sites with audio and CD-ROMs with sound effects and narration. This is 
what I offered to produce as a service. I was 22 years old, with no experience, 
let alone a track record. As you might expect, I blundered my way through 
many embarrassing episodes. One of them was the brilliant idea of making a 
big marketing splash by sending 100 potential clients little boxes of chocolate 
with my business card inside. After a few days, I called the clients and asked 
whether I could come by for a meeting to show my services. It turned out to 
be an unusually hot summer. Someone at the post office must have parked 
their delivery truck in the roasting sun. You can imagine what those well-
intentioned presents looked like when they arrived at the clients by mail. It 
was an expensive marketing stunt gone wrong.
Finally landing my first paid project put the gears in motion. The Internet was 
rocket fuel to the economy, so more projects followed in swift ­succession. 
All in all, I have to admit I was lucky that this first startup was successful. 
Many other entrepreneurs went under in the first dot.com crash. Their 
founders had come from much more privileged backgrounds than me. Some 
were MBAs; others were launching their second company with powerful joint 
­venture partners and ample funding. Because none of that was available to 
me, I had to be creative and resourceful from day one. Had I relied on my 
surroundings and waited until someone took me under their wing to make 
things happen for me, I would not be writing this book today. Through trial 
and error, I found an approach that helped my company become profitable 
fast, with products that clients paid money for from the start. This trial phase 
is something I still draw from today. Some of the startup advice in this book 
is directly related to it.
Fortunately, it got easier over time. With more experience, I put less trust 
in those who insisted that starting a successful company without funding was 
impossible, perhaps because I knew that it could be accomplished. Not all my 
ventures were profitable, but the failures were just as valuable as the successes.

An iron will and common sense go a long way. Unfortunately, these are what 
I see lacking with many of today’s startup entrepreneurs. A flood of recent 
­business literature gives founders the impression that they have to study entre-
preneurship before they can do it. Grant programs, government ­initiatives, and 
startup workshops saturate them with theory, taught by people who have 
never started a company themselves. Media stories about recently minted 
billionaire founders are selling the Hollywood version of entrepreneurship. 
Please do not buy into this hype.
Entrepreneurs have always existed, and to launch a thriving business is 
doable with little theory if you put your mind to it. It was possible before 
any ­government grants existed and before venture capital and seed accelera-
tors arrived on the scene. You need the determination to succeed and a few 
simple strategies. Most important, you have to take action, sooner rather than 
later. The ­simplicity of entrepreneurship is its power. This power lies with the 
entrepreneur alone. As soon as you take matters into your own hands, you 
will start making real progress toward your own success story.
If you come from an entrepreneurial family, then you have a better chance of 
making it. But if not, what will you do? Not even try because nobody is helping 
you? Quietly agree with the opinion of the mainstream that startup success 
is a lottery or requires an MBA and millions of dollars in venture capital?  
If your university or government has programs available, then take full ­advantage 
of them. But do not let them distract you. If you get on the wrong trajectory 
early, reaching your destination will be a challenge.
A recurring theme of this book is taking matters into your own hands to 
move your startup forward step by step. On the way, take advantage of all the 
synergies you can get. Learn from your mistakes. Pick yourself up and keep 
walking. Take initiative, and never wait for opportunities to come to you. This 
is the defining characteristic of a successful entrepreneur.  

The Status 
Quo: How Do 
Startups Fit into 
Universities?
Students and researchers have always founded their own companies right out 
of universities. This is not new. Just as in any other venture, some of those 
companies thrive, while others falter. Some entrepreneurs have a natural tal-
ent for running a business, whereas others are less skilled. In recent years, 
there has been a huge surge of interest in entrepreneurship, both inside and 
outside universities. Researchers are beginning to realize that running their 
own company may be more adventurous and rewarding than a lifetime teach-
ing position in higher education. Students converge on popular fields such 
as computer science to launch their own companies while working on their 
degree or after graduation. News stories abound about 20-year-olds turning 
into billionaires with virtual reality startups.1

Entrepreneurship has attracted global buzz. However, when it comes to prac-
tical know-how about launching a startup, universities have much catching 
up to do. To fill the void, incubators and seed accelerators have sprung up as 
startup schools that offer crash courses in entrepreneurship, infrastructure, 
mentoring, and financial aid.
Before you jump in and learn about the practical guidelines for entrepre-
neurs, you first need to understand the place of startups in universities today. 
This chapter explains the components that enable startup success, how they 
interact with each other and how universities currently put them to use. It 
also outlines the launch sequence of academic startups and the roadblocks 
entrepreneurs encounter, Later in this book, we will look into some of the 
support systems available for startups, such as entrepreneurship programs, 
technology transfers, and startup grants. The discussion would be incomplete 
without deliberating on why some of these programs are useful and others 
less so. This chapter also introduces the main obstacles that stand in the way 
of setting up effective startup programs at universities, and common miscon-
ceptions about startup entrepreneurship in general. This groundwork sets the 
tone for the rest of this book. Without it, I feel entrepreneurs have only half 
the picture of what it means to launch a company. Examples for upgrading a 
university’s startup program are in the second part of this book.
Universities Can Build the Optimal Startup 
Ecosystem
Universities are still the undisputed centers of excellence when it comes to 
knowledge and scientific research. But using their assets in the marketplace 
is not their strength, and, unfortunately, the impact of scientific research on 
the lives of people outside of academia is small. This is unnecessary, because 
universities occupy an important space at the intersection between science, 
business, and public policy. They connect many stakeholders from different 
domains in their daily activities. Some universities have a high pedigree and an 
international reputation that draw attention from financial investors and the 
media. They participate in summits such as the World Economic Forum (WEF), 
world city summits, and climate conferences. Universities often interact with 
multinational companies that sponsor their research. And the government is 
also on board as principal financier.
Despite the fact that opportunities for network building and cooperations are 
readily available to them, universities hardly use them enough for their own 
benefit. They actively communicate with many third parties, but the energy 
this creates often evaporates, unused. If universities channeled this energy, 
they could help create a robust ecosystem for startups, to the advantage of

students and researchers interested in entrepreneurship. Such an ecosystem 
would prepare participants for the journey ahead and would eventually build 
a bridge between scientific research and millions of people who stand to gain 
from it in their everyday lives. It would anchor the university in the public 
image as a force for real-world impact. And it would motivate staff and profes-
sors to discover a deeper meaning in their work. Let’s examine what such an 
ecosystem could look like.
Universities are platforms. Many different stakeholders exchange ideas and 
energy with universities daily, creating vast potential resources that are just 
sitting there, unused. As soon as universities focus and channel energy toward 
their startups, synergies emerge. Dynamic knowledge exchange, collabora-
tions, constant feedback, and engaged discussions grow a ring of network effects 
around the institution (the large arrows in Figure 1-1).

With the energy and momentum available on this supercharged platform, 
startups load their batteries and eventually lift off like helicopters. Figure 1-2 
shows what the ideal situation looks like. A university with a strong entrepre-
neurial ecosystem is the ideal launch pad for startups founded by students and 
researchers. Most universities have all the components to build it right in their 
backyard. They just need to remove the blockages that prevent the ecosystem 
from growing. Academia is a natural magnet for smart people and interested 
external stakeholders. As soon as their energy is channeled toward a com-
mon goal, startups in this environment draw on much stronger resources than 
the private sector alone can provide.
Figure 1-2. The university ecosystem turns into the ideal startup launch pad
However, such ecosystems are still nascent or nonexistent. A few global 
hotspots have managed to create them over the last couple of decades, but 
one can count them on the fingers of one hand. At present, most synergies lie 
dormant, and startup launch pads are not fully formed. To understand what 
this does to university entrepreneurship, look at Figure 1-3, which illustrates 
the current, incomplete version of the launch pad.

University Startups and Spin-Offs

The status quo looks much less inviting. A weak entrepreneurial ecosystem 
leads to a weak startup launch pad. The ring of network effects around the 
university is interrupted, and no ecosystem can grow. Synergistic interaction 
with third parties is almost entirely missing, which leads to roadblocks and 
gaps in the structure. Far fewer startups are possible on an incomplete plat-
form. That is obvious, because there simply is not enough room and energy 
for them to thrive. Serious pitfalls can hamper startups at any stage of their 
evolution. Looking at it from this perspective, it is evident why so few success-
ful startups come from academia.
Why don’t universities repair their incomplete startup launch pads? They 
would first have to grow stronger entrepreneurial ecosystems, and the need 
to do that is not yet dire enough. In many universities, the opinion prevails that 
entrepreneurship workshops, business plan competitions, and grant funding 
will fix the underlying structural problems. However, without a fundamental 
shift in the way academics and institutions approach entrepreneurship, current 
efforts will bring mostly cosmetic improvements that only go so far. This is 
unfortunate. As education becomes increasingly globalized, it will be critical 
for universities to adopt entrepreneurial thinking and have something to show  
for it. It will no longer be sufficient to point to key performance indicators (KPIs)  
that show a certain number of spin-off companies or patent applications per 
year. Uncomfortable questions about the measurable impact of such start-
ups will surface. This may not happen immediately, but the day will come. 
Academia will have a lot of catching up to do then.
Figure 1-3.  Startups on the incomplete launch pad

The good news is that many ideas coming out of universities are groundbreak-
ing. They have the potential to make a difference in the lives of millions of 
people. With a mind shift, it will be possible to transform the status quo at 
universities into thriving ecosystems for startups. It will take much effort to 
put the gears in motion. How universities can do this is the subject of part 2 
of this book. Let’s first discuss the necessary steps and the roadblocks on the 
way to startup success.
The Startup Launch Process
With their natural wealth of resources and synergies, universities should be 
hotbeds of startup success. Let’s pretend for a few minutes that everything is 
perfect and universities make the most of the opportunities available to them. 
Figure 1-4 shows the ideal launch sequence for startups.

The underlying forces that enable startup success are as follows:
• 
Motivation and freedom: Students and researchers have a 
strong motivation and the freedom to follow through on 
their ideas for startups.
• 
Synergies and ecosystem: The university has cleared  
roadblocks to synergies and has allowed an entrepre-
neurial ecosystem to grow. Startups draw massive energy 
from that.
• 
Network effects: Once enough synergies are in place, 
network effects kick in. Launching additional startups 
becomes increasingly easy, and startups stand a better 
chance of making an impact in the market.
If these forces are in place, the stage is set for startups to take off. How uni-
versities may develop these forces is the subject of the second part of this 
book. For the time being, let’s assume they exist already. In the ideal environ-
ment, all that students and researchers need is a practical approach to entre-
preneurship. Unless they mismanage their venture in the launch process, they 
automatically achieve the right trajectory.
To illustrate how the launch sequence works, let’s start with a research proj-
ect at a university. Assume the team had an idea about a potential commercial 
product and decides to launch a startup. Empowered to do so, they first test 
their assumptions. Without testing, the startup would be flying blind. Serious 
entrepreneurs cannot afford to do that; they need to know if their intended 
product meets a demand in the market. If enough people are ready and will-
ing to pay money for the product, then there is a business. The startup can 
charge ahead full-steam and develop the product incrementally. The founders 
test and re-test their upgrades often with potential customers in the market. 
In parallel, they begin building relationships with third parties. These may be 
companies in the same field or other experienced entrepreneurs who have 
already launched successful startups. The financial sector and wealthy indi-
viduals should also be part of entrepreneurs’ networks. The startup engages 
them all for frequent feedback on their progress and a dynamic exchange  
of ideas.
Because the founders communicate effectively and professionally, they have a 
clear understanding of who to approach. They also understand the benefits 
they provide to third parties. With actionable next steps, they keep them 
involved and direct all the energy they can into the development of their 
product. Because stakeholders outside of the university see a value in what 
the startup produces, they inspire the founders with ideas. When the prod-
uct has evolved to the point that the startup can launch it in the market, 
the team brings their connections to venture capital firms to the table. The 
entrepreneurs can scale rapidly when they need to. Their product serves

an existing need in the market, and their business model is strong enough to 
drive a profitable company. Because they always had an ear to the ground, the 
launch is a success. The startup transformed university research into a useful 
product that improves the lives of people. It has a measurable impact on the 
real world.
Universities and their entrepreneurs should continue to strive for this ideal 
process. As you already learned, universities can build powerful ecosystems 
for startups. Once they have achieved that, reality will be closer to the ideal 
scenario we just described.
Let’s now take off the rose-colored glasses. Unfortunately, the reality for 
startups at universities is less than ideal. The experience for entrepreneurs 
can often feel similar to the illustration in Figure 1-5.

Numerous roadblocks prevent startups from moving from one step to the 
next. Entrepreneurs cannot skip any of the steps of the launch sequence—
they are all necessary to build a solid foundation for the startup. Some of the 
hurdles are external: they exist within universities that are unprepared to give 
startups what they need. Synergies, the ecosystem, and network effects may be 
missing. Other hurdles are internal: students and researchers may not know 
how to advance from one level to the next. They linger in analysis paralysis 
or lack constructive strategies to express and develop their ideas. They often 
struggle to define their own value for third parties, let alone engage them 
in a mutual knowledge exchange. As a result, their networks are not strong 
enough to help them reach escape velocity. Despite good ideas, many startups 
are trapped on the ground level. They never launch a useful product, so they 
fail to attract a joint venture partner or venture capital. Such startups and 
spin-off companies do show up in the university’s KPIs, but their measurable 
impact is zero.
So what is there to do? It will take a while for universities to get their eco-
systems up to speed. In the meantime, it is up to the entrepreneurs to over-
come the roadblocks. More often than not, the prevailing thought is that more 
money fixes all problems. But instead of paying the roadblocks to go away, 
startup entrepreneurs need to know practical strategies to overcome them 
(see Figure 1-6).

Chapter 1 | The Status Quo: How Do Startups Fit into Universities?
14
In a less-than-perfect world, students and researchers must take matters into 
their own hands. Whenever they encounter roadblocks, they should know 
how to kick them away with the right karate moves. With entrepreneurial 
thinking at their disposal, they develop products with the lean method. They 
learn how to articulate their business ideas to third parties outside of the 
university. This gives them a clear understanding of their value proposition and 
helps identify the right partners, which helps them to build strong networks 
with established companies and the financial sector.
When they have to fend for themselves, startups may advance more slowly 
than in the ideal launch sequence, but they do so steadily nevertheless. They 
move forward step by step and eventually take off on their own terms. By 
developing their own powers, entrepreneurs can thrive in today’s less-than-
perfect ecosystem. What these powers are and how to acquire them is up 
next in this book.

The Lean 
Startup Changed 
Everything
When Eric Ries published his book The Lean Startup in 2011, he brought about 
a paradigm shift in business modeling.1 Only a few of the ideas in the book 
were groundbreaking or new, but many people were seeing them outlined 
neatly and logically for the first time. According to the Lean Startup method, 
“build, measure, learn” is at the heart of entrepreneurship. This means testing, 
measuring, changing, and retesting several hypotheses before a product launch. 
Real potential clients give feedback on minimum viable products (MVPs), which 
helps tailor the product or service to the market in small steps. Learning 
and experimenting therefore trump planning and politics. Businesses focus on 
product development close to their customers to improve their impact from 
day one. Hallelujah!
When the book came out, I was recovering from a venture that had started 
out promisingly. Flush with seed investment in the mid-six figures, the com-
pany I cofounded in San Francisco was about to revolutionize the trading of 
copyrights, trademarks, and patents on a digital platform. Offices in the Mission 
District were rented. A board 12 members strong, including executives from

eBay, was summoned. A fancy code shop full of developers was hired to pro-
gram the platform. Hours were spent in conference calls, with phone-ins from 
different continents. Things were looking up, until the financial crisis in 2007/8 
came around. The second round of financing fell through, and the startup col-
lapsed under its heavy overhead without having launched a single line of code. 
This was the opposite of a lean startup, and it is painful to remember all the 
silliness. We wasted much time, not to mention the investment of the venture 
capital firm. Lucky for us, they understood that bad things happen to good 
people, which softened unwinding the mess a great deal. Having such lenient 
investors was by no means a foregone conclusion.
According to the Lean Startup method, we should have approached the busi-
ness differently. Instead of trying to build a new universe to revolutionize the 
licensing market with a big bang, we should have thought about our MVP first. 
If we had coded it ourselves, we could have tested it daily with actual potential 
users and clients. We probably would have learned that the original idea was 
much too large and doomed to fail and that we should focus on a smaller niche 
from the beginning. We could have found the most profitable niche through 
further testing. With clear signals for or against the need for such a platform 
and a much stronger idea of what the code should look like we could have 
engaged professional developers to finish the beta for launch. Going about the 
project this way would have required only 10% of the investment, with much 
more learning and insight along the way. Instead we were flying blind based 
solely on our own rigid assumptions, which we even vehemently defended to 
investors and advisors.
Before the Lean Startup method became widely adopted, most business found-
ers focused primarily on launching the perfect product and much less on feed-
back from the market. Long brainstorming sessions about the perfect strategy 
replaced simply trying something and seeing what happened. Entrepreneurs 
founding a company today should figure out how to run it lean to make the 
best use of their resources.
The Lean Startup method is not only for tech startups. Multinationals like 
General Motors use it for their in-house R&D as well. Steve Blank goes as 
far as calling it a new strategy for the 21st century that goes hand in hand 
with other changes like democratization of knowledge and capital, low startup 
costs, mobility, globalization, and convergence.2
There are various schools of thought about launching a company. For univer-
sity startups, I find the Lean Startup method ideal. This chapter explains how 
to apply it with two examples. But let’s first understand the main underlying 
principles.

(May 2013).

Incremental Product Development
Under the old paradigm, most university startups think they have to brain-
storm extensively to arrive at the perfect product. After meticulous planning, 
they build it behind locked doors and finally launch it in the market with a 
big splash. This is expensive and risky and also impractical. There is a more 
intuitive approach to develop products, which the Lean Startup method refers 
to as incremental product development. This is how it works: you first create 
an MVP based on your assumptions about what the market could be willing 
to accept. This is obviously not the full-featured version of your ideal prod-
uct, but the opposite. The simplest, least-expensive product you can produce 
quickly with the sole purpose of getting feedback from real potential clients 
is your MVP 1. Now you continually improve your product, called pivoting in 
Lean Startup jargon. You test the next assumption with MVP 2—for example, 
when you have fixed the flaws in MVP 1 and made it more complex with 
added features. Along the way, the product becomes better and better, and 
it is always approved by the market. At some point, you feel it has developed 
into a robust commercial version that enough clients are willing to pay money 
for. Only then do you launch your first actual product (the final MVP) in the 
market. Even after launch, product development still continues. You keep col-
lecting information about how you could improve the product in an upgrade 
or the next version. Figure 2-1 illustrates this process.

For each MVP, you need to test two hypotheses: the value hypothesis (whether 
anybody in the market wants it) and the growth hypothesis (whether there is 
sufficient demand in the market to have a business). This boils down to, “Do 
people want our product?” and “Will enough of them pay for it?” Often, both 
hypothesis tests can occur at the same time. MVP testing is about experiment-
ing and recording your findings—not in the lab, but in the real market with 
real potential clients. By leaving the building, you shift the question from “Can 
we build it?” to “Should we build it?” If your market gives you the thumbs up, 
then you have a business, and the startup is ready for takeoff. Otherwise, keep 
experimenting with other MVPs.
Most university startups, even those with repeated grant funding, have never 
conducted such tests and are not going to do so anytime soon. This is unfor-
tunate, because in a global marketplace you cannot afford to fly blind. You are 
up against millions of highly motivated incremental product testers who are 
validating hypotheses on a daily basis to get a head start. Spending time writing 
grant proposals will put you at a disadvantage.
Simplify, Then Simplify Again
The idea of testing MVPs sounds intuitive—that is, until you try to apply it in 
your own startup. It can be surprisingly hard to come up with a quick product 
that can be tested easily. Not only that, but you need to be able to implement 
that feedback rapidly to improve your product. If your MVP is too complex 
or expensive to build, you may collect some feedback, but incremental devel-
opment will be tedious. Finding the right MVP is therefore the first order of 
business for a startup.
As a software company, especially when your product involves a mobile app, 
you can quickly mock up a user experience with design software or even on 
paper. It is less easy when your startup involves hardware. The MVP is never 
what you would like to make, but what you can make today with little fund-
ing and no additional materials. Toward that end, Table 2-1 outlines a simple 
process to find possible MVPs.

The goal of this exercise is to find an MVP that you can create quickly with 
the materials you already have. Go down the list until you cannot simplify any 
more. As a rule, the most-reduced product is always just a picture of what you 
want to make. This may sound trite, but many startups think their technology 
is too complex to create an MVP. You may have an animation, a screenshot, 
or any other visual representation of your product. Get feedback on this 
first, using a checklist like that in Figure 2-2. Then you can step up and test a 
physical MVP. Ideally it should cost you nothing, because you can easily put it 
together yourself. You should be able to produce this MVP in a few days.
How do potential customers use the product? 
What do you learn from observing them?
What do they say about the product?
What do they like, what do they not like?
Would they pay price X for the product?
How do they suggest you improve the product?
What are your own impressions about needed changes?
How can you improve the product based on this feedback?

Entrepreneurs generally like to start with the maximum viable product in mind. 
To scale that down to the minimum is easier said than done. Researchers in 
particular feel like frauds unless their product is flawless. In startup entrepre-
neurship, this is impractical. Pivoting a buggy product wins the day. Have you 
thought hard, but you cannot come up with any ideas to simplify the MVP? 
Engage your team in a brainstorming session. Perhaps also invite the accountant 
and the guy who does IT support at your university. Those without domain 
knowledge sometimes have unexpected suggestions that help you strip down 
your MVP. You will have difficulty to gather timely information in the market 
if your product is too complex. The worst outcome is to perfectly carry out 
a plan that results in a product nobody wants. Better to make the simplest 
prototype you can think of and show it to potential consumers today.
The Lean Startup in Action, 1: Battery Startup
Imagine the following fictitious example. Three PhDs named Adam, Ben, and 
Christine are working on their postdoc, researching a new smartphone bat-
tery technology. Not only is their battery biodegradable, it also fully recharges 
in ten minutes. Two years of diligent research have yielded promising results, 
and the postdoc is nearing its end. One evening, over beers, the team talks 
about their future, and someone makes a joke about starting their own bat-
tery firm. Hours later the trio is still brainstorming about how to do that, and 
it becomes obvious the entrepreneurial bug has bitten them. The idea sounds 
even better the next morning. But where to begin? They have published 
several papers about the technology and given presentations at congresses. 
Industry leaders have expressed vague interest in “doing something together,” 
but none of the team knows much about business or raising funds. Their 
scientific advisor supports the startup idea. She proposes that they write a 
business plan, make a budget, and apply for grant XYZ. The grant-award date 
is 12 months away.
Instead of getting sidetracked in writing a lengthy business plan and a grant 
proposal, the team should first gain clarity about their motivation and product. 
They should start confirming their idea while they still have the infrastructure 
of the university available. Is the battery (or a variation of it) something the 
market wants? If so, what price will buyers be prepared to pay for it? Does 
the team really want to run a company? They should start thinking about 
their MVP. Instead of the finished battery for the smartphone, this will be per-
haps a larger rechargeable battery that the team could create more quickly. 
In the best case, the MVP is a good-enough product they can produce in a 
small series for market testing without much effort. Before they produce the 
MVP, the team should leave the lab and speak with manufacturers and whole-
sale and retail customers about the product. Would they carry it in their 
stores or make their distribution channels available? Will they pay price X?  

University Startups and Spin-Offs
21
What about price Y? The first MVP could be an advertisement in which the 
battery is available only on paper for preorder. In love and war, all is fair. 
Another simple MVP could be a campaign on a crowdfunding platform such as 
Kickstarter. The goal is to get real-life data from potential clients fast, without 
spending much time and money.
Once you start thinking about possible test cases, you will come up with many. 
The key is to engage your thinking along this path and get busy—not in the 
bubble of the lab, but in the real market.
Back to the battery startup. Within a month of the first hypothesis test, one 
of the team, Adam, has thrown the towel and left for his native land where a 
position on a tenure track beckons. Good for him. Now it is up to Ben and 
Christine. They have found that the biodegradable, rechargeable battery they 
imagined is too expensive to make. However, if they forget about making it 
rechargeable, they can offer it competitively. But then it will no longer work 
in a smartphone. Interviews and responses to the mock advertisement have 
shown that a deep market exists for biodegradable batteries. The simplest 
battery they can produce is a car battery. Tests with potential buyers have 
validated both the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis: people want a 
biodegradable car battery and are willing to pay for it.
Let’s recap. The team wanted to produce a smartphone battery, but it became 
obvious that they needed to simplify their MVP. The original idea involved 
complex manufacturing, device dependence, and other roadblocks that can 
only be overcome with scale. As a result, they had to think about other appli-
cations of batteries, such as AAA, 4.5 volt, CR, and car batteries. Whichever 
of these was the simplest for them to make, they chose as their MVP. Tests of 
the car battery in the market showed that there were willing buyers for such 
a product. Thus, with a car battery, they have a product that satisfied the value 
hypothesis and the growth hypothesis. With this, they have a valid business 
idea and can move forward.
The startup duo can now decide whether they still want to embark on the 
venture. If they do, they may approach a leading battery manufacturer and offer 
to enter a joint venture to further improve, test, and finally mass-produce the 
battery. If this happens, they will not need to raise funding because their joint 
venture will be a subsidiary of the battery manufacturer, in which both Ben 
and Christine will own equity. The university will often also own a small stake 
in spin-off companies, which is only fair.
To engage the battery manufacturer, Ben and Christine had to first confirm 
their idea. They had to find out the original product they planned was imprac-
tical and too expensive to produce. Only through testing in the real market 
could they match their technology with existing demand. Because they were 
running lean, they developed a useful product inexpensively. Had they not 
done that, someone else would have had to figure out the right product based 

Chapter 2 | The Lean Startup Changed Everything
22
on their technology. This is often unattractive for joint venture partners, who 
have enough on their minds with their own problems. Yet if you can prove to 
them that a profitable market for your validated product exists, their risk is 
much lower. They only need to finalize the product and can then integrate it 
in their sales and distribution channels.
This is an idealized story, of course. But note that no business plan was at the 
heart of this team’s success. Many assumptions about the project changed, 
which would have resulted in pointless updates to a business plan that nobody 
will ever read. And no grant proposal was submitted. Had the team done that, 
they would have robbed themselves of momentum, valuable data, and deeper 
insights about the nature of the market. This eventually laid the foundation for 
the future of the business. As a bonus, they learned that one of the cofounders 
was uncomfortable with startup life and preferred a 9-to-5 job. Sorting this 
out later down the road would have been a messy affair.
Because lean product development is inexpensive, startups have strategies at 
their disposal to test ideas and assumptions right away. From the beginning, 
they have one foot firmly planted in the market, collecting feedback and incre-
mentally developing products. The founders immediately see what startup 
entrepreneurship entails and can decide if they are cut out for it or not. 
Gaining momentum as early as possible is extremely valuable. The lean startup 
will always have a leg up against those who sit at their desks, formulating per-
fect business plans even before they test their product ideas in the market.
The Lean Startup in Action, 2: Electric Scooter 
Startup
Let’s look at another fictitious example of MVP testing. In this case, a proto-
type exists that incorporates several individual technologies. This is frequent 
with university startups.
Assume that in his PhD, Simon has built an electric scooter that he wants to 
bring to the market with a startup. The scooter has a slick design with sev-
eral innovations in the technology of the wheels and the closed body. Other 
features include a newly developed accelerator, regenerative braking, and a 
quick-charging battery. Simon believes the retail price of the scooter should 
be around $2,000. A prototype of the scooter exists in the lab, but he is 
unsure what to do as the first step to commercialize the idea. How should he 
go about all this with the Lean Startup method?
First, Simon should test the value hypothesis with potential buyers of the 
scooter. Do they want what he built in the lab? If the scooter drives safely, he 
could test the prototype right out of the gate. However, this is not his MVP. 
What will Simon do if he finds that test drivers do not like the prototype? 

University Startups and Spin-Offs
23
Is there something wrong with the wheels, the body, the accelerator, or the 
brakes? There are too many moving parts, which will prevent him from gather-
ing meaningful feedback, and he will be no wiser than when he started. Instead 
he should simplify the MVP and break down the tests into several steps.
Simon can start by testing any of the scooter’s components, but he should 
focus on the one that is easiest to test. Is it the battery, the wheel design, the 
electronics, certain features of the build, or something else? He should find 
the MVP, with emphasis on minimum. If he is testing the wheel design, then he 
can take an existing scooter and just add his wheels. He has already tested 
them in the lab to see how much traction they have and how many hours 
they last with normal use. Now he has to leave the building and invite some 
potential customers for a ride to see what happens. Do they prefer his wheels, 
or are they indifferent? Simon should measure how his MVP scooter fares 
compared to a normal model. He may learn that customers love the wheel 
design, because it provides a new kind of driving experience. If this is the 
case, he could commercialize the wheels alone and approach a manufacturer. 
Right from the beginning, Simon’s startup has a product with the potential to 
generate revenue. If he was still brainstorming about how to build the perfect 
untested prototype, he might never have known that a marketable product 
was lying around in the lab, unused.
Simon has tested the wheels. Test riders felt that they are “more fun” than 
traditional wheels, because they are easier to navigate with. He records this 
and moves on to the next MVP. To find out how close to the market his 
original prototype is, he adds parts of his scooter to the MVP one by one and 
tests how long the market still accepts it as a product. The next component 
of the scooter is the accelerator. Simon adds it to MVP 1 and arrives at  
MVP 2 (wheels and accelerator). He tests it in the center of town, where most 
potential buyers of the scooter are. One day, it begins to rain unexpectedly, 
and the accelerator stops working. He never knew of this flaw, because up to 
this point, he only tried it in the university’s air-conditioned hangar. He can 
now find out what the problem is, improve the accelerator, and test it again.
Then Simon moves on to the brakes. Afterward he tests the closed body.  
The original prototype of the body turns out to be impractical for most 
potential users. So Simon mocks up changes with CAD software and shows 
the renderings to potential customers, just to see what they say. He adapts 
and improves the design until the market gives him the thumbs up.
He moves along like this until he has tested all the different features of his pro-
totype. The wheels and the accelerator deliver a new driving experience, but 
the fast-charging battery adds too much weight, which slows down the scooter. 
He learns which individual parts—the wheels and the accelerator—satisfy the 
value hypothesis of the market. So, Simon could start with them alone as his 
first products. Had he tested his prototype in one go, he would have gotten 
either a positive or a negative response and would not have known where to

start with improvements. Based on his findings in MVP testing (illustrated in 
Figure 2-3), he can now commercialize the individual components and build a 
scooter the market wants.

Simon confirmed several value hypotheses. How about the growth hypoth-
esis? Will people pay $2,000 for the scooter? If some testers already want to 
buy the scooter, then yes. Otherwise, Simon can speak with potential custom-
ers about pricing and find out this way. He may learn that adding the closed 
body leads to most of the cost, so he has a bigger market if he produces a 
conventional, open scooter. In either case, Simon has first-hand intelligence 
about his market and his customers’ preferences.
To have a viable startup, both the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis 
need to check out. When they do, a startup is infinitely more advanced than 
one that is still brainstorming. If Simon is not exhausted yet and wants to pur-
sue entrepreneurship with his startup, then he is in the game, up and running.
A Startup Coach Can Be Valuable
In the real world, the process of creating and testing MVPs is easier said than 
done. Doing so often requires experience and unconventional thinking that 
may not be native to the founding team. It is therefore helpful to engage a 
startup coach for the research team in the early stages, when the idea seems 
daunting and many insecurities about the path ahead exist. Universities are 
often open to engaging external advisors for startups. Of course, this should 
not be theoretical advice or yet another weekend workshop in startup entre-
preneurship. An MBA or economics student from another faculty who will 
work on the case as part of their master’s thesis also is not enough. The team 
needs a dedicated, experienced entrepreneur who will enjoy working with 
them for several weeks in the lab to address their challenges.

University Startups and Spin-Offs
25
Research shows that it is often very effective to learn a new skill by seeing an 
expert doing it and then repeating it.3 This approach trumps theoretical advice 
any time, as well as self-directed learning by doing. If startups have access to 
a seasoned entrepreneur who works with them one-on-one, this can make 
all the difference. It can accelerate the learning curve by two or even three 
times while avoiding many early common pitfalls and distractions. If the team 
has built their own network and reached out to other entrepreneurs, they 
may suggest someone they see fit as their advisor. A startup coach should 
obviously have firsthand entrepreneurial experience, but domain knowledge is 
unnecessary. The whole point of working with a coach is to get an outsider’s 
view and a fresh perspective on the team’s challenges. Domain knowledge 
exists already on the team in the form of the founders. The added value of the 
startup coach lies more in management: getting the startup out of the building 
and into the market as soon as possible.
Do You Need a Business Plan?
A business plan in the classic sense is a thing of the past. It is largely a thought 
experiment with little merit once a business has gotten underway. Some 
entrepreneurs admit that but insist the business plan can be a guideline to 
keep them on track and their thinking focused. To me, it is the other way 
around: once you start, you need to be as flexible as possible to pivot and 
incrementally change your products and services. A rigid 50-page document 
will only hinder you in that regard. I have never written a business plan for any 
of my businesses in almost 20 years. Launching a startup is an exercise not in 
thinking, but in doing. The practice of requiring a written document before tak-
ing any action is against the nature of entrepreneurship. Flexibility and time to 
market are much more important than perfect planning and consideration of 
eventualities. A business plan stands in the way of getting started.
Of course, you still need to think about your startup in a systematic man-
ner before taking the plunge. This is important, but you need to do it with 
an open mind. A relatively new approach is the business model canvas, which 
is basically a business plan condensed onto one page.4 It does away with the 
need for speculation about potential revenue down the road and focuses on a

few specific key questions about the business and its market. An updated ver-
sion of the business model canvas has been proposed by author Ash Maurya.5 
His lean canvas is what I use for the startups I work with (see Figure 2-4). 
Although the original canvas is good to analyze a business, the lean canvas 
helps entrepreneurs get started quickly. I also find it more useful when I need 
to discuss the business with third parties.

When filling out the canvas, make a different one for different assumptions. 
For example, if your startup is in Singapore, you should show how it applies 
to the local market, to the wider market in Southeast Asia, and to all of Asia 
including China. Analyze different scenarios for your startup on different  
canvases. If you speak with different third parties, make a canvas for each of them. 
The problems, solutions, unique value propositions, distribution channels,  
customers, costs, and pricing models will vary from market to market. This is 
a good exercise to understand the platform you are playing on.

When you begin, you will quickly find that all this looks simple but is far from

survive much scrutiny and will need an update soon. This is fine, because the 
canvas is the opposite of a business plan set in stone; it is a fluid document 
you use to organize your startup and put the different puzzle pieces together 
over time. Treat the canvas as a work in progress, and carry it around with 
you. Update it as needed, when new findings emerge from market feedback or 
you feel a pivot is necessary. The lean canvas and the financial model, which 
we will visit later are both the cornerstones of your toolkit to present your 
startup to the world.

What Does 
It Mean to 
Be a Startup 
Entrepreneur?
Thanks to the movie The Social Network, we now all know what startup entre-
preneurship is like.1 Late night hackathons in the house in Silicon Valley, half-
empty pizza boxes and shot glasses everywhere, groupies, parties. We lost a 
few friends on the way, but there is still the billion dollar paycheck at the end 
of the road. It would be nice if this were true. Unfortunately, it is not—unless 
you are Mark Zuckerberg. Entrepreneurship is fun, but rarely the sort of fun 
shown in the movies. More the fun of solving a complicated chess problem. 
Or the fun of writing a beautiful mathematical equation. Or combining many 
agents who seemed unconnected into a springboard for your product.
At this point, I encourage you to stop for a minute and think about your 
motivations for startup entrepreneurship. Are you seriously dedicated to 
making this work? Or is the startup more of a convenient strategy to stay a 
little longer at your research institute after your postdoc has run its course?

Do you just want to find out what it is like to dabble in entrepreneurship, with 
no plan to see the whole affair through? Ask yourself the inconvenient ques-
tions at the beginning. Be aware that unless you have a strong motivation, it 
will be hard to enjoy the fruits of your labor, in terms of both experience and 
success. I believe that everybody has entrepreneurship in them. That’s why I 
encourage you to give it an honest try.
Entrepreneurship is taking place on a global stage today. Right this second, mil-
lions of startup entrepreneurs are thinking about how they can take market 
share from somebody else. They are hungry, scratching and clawing their way 
into the market with little or no capital. They are fueled by Top Ramen, sleep-
ing three hours a night in their parents’ basement (at age 35), with no other 
choice than to make their startup work. You need to know that launching a 
successful startup is no cakewalk. It also has little to do with a lottery that 
you can play passively and hope to win the jackpot. Honestly check your own 
motives and those of your team before you charge forward. This chapter is 
not meant to dissuade you from entrepreneurship, but you should understand 
what you are getting into before you dedicate time and resources to this 
rewarding but demanding challenge.
You may have guessed it by now—there is no quick fix to launch a startup. 
There is also no secret sauce that only the chosen few have. Viewed from a 
distance, entrepreneurship is just a persistent movement toward a certain 
goal. The road is winding, and you only see the short distance right ahead 
of you. By taking one step after the next and adjusting your course, you will 
eventually achieve the goal. That’s it. This chapter discusses some defining 
characteristics of entrepreneurship and some loosely defined ground rules 
that distinguish entrepreneurs from non-entrepreneurs. Some of those may 
be unexpected because they are different from commonly accepted business 
advice. They come primarily from my personal observation and experience, 
with no claim to be contextually exhaustive. Think of this chapter as a conver-
sation with someone who shares his personal viewpoints about the mindset 
required to become an entrepreneur.
More Management Than Creativity
Contrary to public opinion, entrepreneurship is nothing like going to the 
casino and betting everything on red 13. It is more perspiration and manage-
ment than fun and games. Creativity is important, but long stretches of run-
ning a company have little to do with that. In other words, startup success 
lies less in creative planning and brainstorming and more in doing and taking 
action. Many nights are spent diligently managing delicate issues, evaluating 
data, and troubleshooting. Researchers have an advantage, because they are 
familiar with meticulous documentation, statistical testing, and reporting their 
findings. This can be a considerable asset over the college dropout who has a

great idea but few tools and no patience to work with data. Startup entrepre-
neurship has a great deal to do with tinkering. Getting it right the first time is 
nearly impossible. Make sure you have the energy and flexibility to adjust your 
course when you see that improvements are necessary.
Here is another popular view of entrepreneurship. A team has decided to 
launch a startup. Before they can do so, they need to brainstorm for months 
about the perfect product. Finally they hit on a brilliant idea, which they carry 
out over the following months by endlessly laboring in their top-secret lab. 
They get feedback from MBAs who help them create the perfect business plan 
and marketing plan. With the perfect product and the perfect plan to push it 
into the market, they are prepared to conquer the world.
I certainly thought this is how it works until I launched my first startup. 
However, it is an outdated notion of product development, which arose in 
the paradigm of mass production that held true during your parents’ lifetime. 
Today’s model is lean production, which Chapter 4 explores in more detail. As 
a startup, you need to first come up with the simplest test product imaginable 
to see how potential buyers react to it. We explored how to do this in the 
previous chapter. You can build your MVP in a few days, with little brainstorm-
ing and planning. When you get positive signals, you continue and improve 
the product. If the signals are negative, you change course, tinker with the 
product, or invent a new one. You do this until you have proof that enough 
people in the market need your product and will pay for it. Then you are ready 
to launch it. Because you tested it in every upgrade cycle, you already know 
which market segments want your product. Advertising and marketing costs 
are minimal and draw on pull factors, not push factors. This requires diligent 
market testing, recording data, managing progress, and keeping track of your 
overall goal. With creativity alone, this is impossible.
Many additional aspects of startups need management. For example, angry cli-
ents, or the lack of clients altogether. A neglected spouse. Concerned parents. 
These require management skills and perhaps some creativity, but mostly they 
just need to be handled. When there is a founding team, even more politics 
and psychology enter the mix. Perhaps one co-founder has lost faith in the 
startup and wants to exit, but still wants to share in future gains of the inven-
tion he helped pioneer. If no paperwork exists, then this can quickly become 
a sticky issue. Or you may receive a cease-and-desist letter from a lawyer in 
a far-off land, stating that you are infringing on patents X, Y, and Z and are 
hereby notified to immediately stop any and all business activity and contact 
her firm to negotiate damage compensation. Dealing with such issues is most 
unwelcome, delicate, and a huge time waster. You can only master them if you 
draw from a well of strength, fueled by your own conviction that you are on 
the right path. Per aspera ad astra.2

Succeed Turtle-Style, Not Kamikaze-Style
Discipline and self-motivation are extremely important for entrepreneurs. 
Forget about the cliché of the entrepreneur who is finally his own boss, 
spends most of the time on the golf course, and wanders into the office 
once in a while to make certain profits are still rolling in. The other cliché 
of the workaholic who only got her startup off the ground by working 24/7 
also is inaccurate. Both of these are extremes—the real-world experience 
lands somewhere in the middle. Although it sounds good to work hard and 
play hard, this is rarely helpful in the long term for entrepreneurs. It is better 
to adopt a disciplined, slightly boring lifestyle to get things done. Putting one 
foot after the other every single day will take you to the finish line faster than 
quick sprints with much exhaustion in between. Binge behavior, even if it is 
good behavior, such as staying up all night to solve a problem, is rarely helpful 
in the long run. Discipline yourself to adopt healthy, sustainable habits. If you 
are older than 30, you know that staying up until 6 am three times in a row 
will take a toll on you. You will achieve your milestones faster if you warm up 
to the idea of getting to the finish line turtle-style, not kamikaze-style.
Willpower vs. Self-Confidence
What about self-confidence? Isn’t that also vital? It is true that those who have 
good self-esteem are more likely to act on their beliefs than those without. 
But research has shown that pep talks in the style of “You can do it” mostly 
improve a person’s ego instead of their performance.3 On the other hand, if 
you develop long-term willpower, you are much more likely to achieve suc-
cess. This is also essential for universities and their advisors. Little good will 
it do their startup performance if they hire motivational coaches or engage 
an expert to give a talk once in a while to fire up the students. Sure, an inter-
esting afternoon will be had by all. But the effect on the bottom line will be 
questionable. It’s better to help startups by providing practical support such 
as a hands-on startup coach or longer-term advisor who is living proof of the 
entrepreneurial attitude required to succeed.
Time Management
Time management is another important skill. Most successful entrepreneurs 
are always working, when they are working. Get the most out of the time you 
have available, especially if you can benefit from the well-equipped research 
laboratory or other infrastructure at your university. Make sure you use it

(New York: Penguin Press, 2011).

thoroughly while you’re at it. Being an entrepreneur occupies a different para-
digm than being a student or staff at a university. The sense of urgency that 
a startup introduces is often foreign to the daily business of research institu-
tions, which mostly run on their own time. When you launch your startup 
lean, time will take on an entirely new meaning for you. It is critical to keep 
your momentum going, so you cannot afford to waste any of it. Stop procras-
tinating. Stop wasting time. Stop spending time with those who do. This may 
mandate some radical strategies, because not everybody at a university is goal 
oriented and on a timeline.
Dealing with disruption is a good skill to learn. First, avoid disrupting your 
own flow. Of course, stay off Twitter and Facebook when you need to get 
something done. Avoid compulsively checking your e-mail or other messaging 
platform. Always being connected is addictive. It is also damaging your concen-
tration. If you wish to improve your time management, turn off all toys that 
may ping you any second. Answer your phone just one hour in the afternoon, 
and make this known on your voice-mail. The same applies to your e-mail. You 
may even want to block out time on your calendar for replying to messages. I 
know this all sounds extreme and strange. If you have enough time during the 
day, a few instant messages here and there will seldom make much impact. But 
if you are on a mission and are strapped for time, then these habits are the 
first that have to go. Shut them off for one day and see what happens—this 
frees up a surprising amount of concentrated time.
There are also many distractions beyond your control. In each office or uni-
versity department, there are always those with too much time on their hands 
who will begin a conversation with you and then ramble on endlessly until 
stopped. They are rarely willfully wasting your time but are simply unaware 
that for entrepreneurs, time is money. If someone has made it a habit for a 
decade or more to stop others in their tracks and tell them about the latest 
thing that happened to so and so, then this behavior will be difficult to shake. 
However, entrepreneurs should beware of those who interrupt their flow. 
After each interruption, even an innocent text message ping, it takes about ten 
minutes to get back to the level of focus you had prior to the interruption.4 
If you are already in a conversation with someone via messaging or e-mail 
and engage in a purely administrative task at the same time, the impact of the 
disruption will be smaller. But if you are in deep thought about your strategy, 
brainstorming a thorny issue, or just getting in the flow with some good ideas 
coming, then even a harmless smiley face sent to your phone can have devas-
tating effects. You will lose your train of thought and may never regain it.

Machinery, 2005).

Assume you get six unexpected text messages a day: one each hour. In addi-
tion to the time you spend responding to these messages, they will cost 
you about 1 full hour of fully focused work during the day—7 hours per 
week, about 30 hours per month. Think about all the brainstorming and 
MVP testing you could complete in that time. Now, what if you get a total 
of 60 messages per day, including text, e-mails, and instant messages, each of 
which you address immediately? You may get some routine work done, but 
your focus and concentration will be subpar most of the time. That may be 
fine if nobody competes with you, but entrepreneurship demands as much 
concentration as practicing martial arts. Postpone interruptions until your 
free time, and avoid all of them during your work hours.
In addition, I strongly recommend that you go on a low-information diet from 
time to time, as recommended by author Tim Ferriss.5 Unplug yourself from 
all media, including news, TV, blogs, e-mails, messaging, phone calls, and so 
forth. Celebrate selective ignorance for a week, and you will find you have all 
the time you need to accomplish what you thought was impossible. You can 
easily do this while working on your startup. Just announce to everyone via 
voicemail and e-mail autoresponder that you will be unavailable for the next 
seven days. Most people will think you are on leave and will postpone their 
questions until you return. Meanwhile, some pressing issues lose their urgency 
or turn out to be unimportant, and you will never know they existed. When 
you return to the plugged-in world after this one-week media fast, you will 
see how stressful all the disruption going on in most people’s lives is. It will 
take you a while to adapt—but before you know it, the Matrix will have you 
back. If you need more time in your life, remove the things that waste it. It is 
as simple as that.
I recently worked with a startup team on the lean canvas. Some good ideas 
were flowing until about an hour into the session, when somebody appeared 
and asked for “just five minutes” of one of the founders’ time. The discussion 
took place in the room where we were working, so this distupted the whole 
group. There was some confusion about a certain unknown webmaster, who 
might have failed to update some content on a web site about a project. 
Finding this webmaster proved difficult, so speculation started about who he 
was and where he might be at present. Perhaps he was on holiday? Or perhaps 
he had left for his home country? Or perhaps it was the entrepreneur himself, 
but he couldn’t remember? Or perhaps … This took fully ten minutes, with 
no conclusion to the matter. I sat there, flabbergasted. Why couldn’t this have 
waited until later? Clearly, the interrupter had no plans to willfully disturb 
our session, and I love her dearly. Yet the effect was devastating. After this

incident, the group never achieved the previous focus and flow. This was a pity, 
because such consulting sessions are rare, and they are exactly what bring 
entrepreneurs forward. Five more minutes of focused attention can make all 
the difference: they can result in a breakthrough about the business model or 
a solution to a certain problem. When you need to focus, hide where people 
cannot find you. Make it a rule to turn off all phones, and ban tablets or laptops 
on which people may otherwise read their instant messages or book a flight 
while you are trying to work.
It is difficult to avoid all interruptions, but you should try to minimize them. 
When others interrupt you with unimportant requests or gossip, the follow-
ing strategies by author Dan Kennedy have worked quite well for me6:
Someone: “Have you got a minute?”
You: “Sorry, but I’m extremely busy today. We can meet at 4:45 pm for 15 
minutes and tackle everything on your list at one time.”
Or even better:
Someone: “I need to discuss something with you.”
You: “I am extremely busy right now and can only deal with tasks that are 
either a nine or ten on a scale of one to ten. Is this a nine or ten?”
Stop Being Late
An often-overlooked component of time management is punctuality. Although 
it may be OK among students to be academically late, business people, bank-
ers, and other entrepreneurs value their time above all else. As the saying 
goes, “Those who cannot be punctual cannot be trusted in other ways either.” 
Nobody will inform you that you should be on time more often—they will just 
categorize you as someone who is habitually late and untrustworthy. Or even 
worse, they will not meet you again and will never do business with you. Avoid 
this at all costs. Being late is rude (both in business and private matters).
When I lived in Los Angeles, one of my neighbors was a retired rock-star gui-
tar player from a famous 1980s band. For 20 years, he had toured the world, 
flown around in private jets, and lived the good life. Just as with entrepreneur-
ship, his lifestyle actually had very little in common with the Hollywood ver-
sion of stardom as all chaos and mayhem. Celebrities have a tight schedule and 
must show up on time. They can only do this with iron discipline and serious 
planning. Whenever I met with this neighbor for coffee, he would suggest an

Press, 2004).

odd time like 9:10 am or 3:25 pm. It later occurred to me that he was running 
on a schedule partitioned in slices of five and ten minutes: 9:10 am meant 9:10 
am, not 9:15 am. In those five minutes he could have done something else, 
and time is money. Do you think someone like this would give you another 
meeting if you were 15 minutes late? There is no need to be that extreme, 
but you get the point. Make it a rule to be extra punctual to all meetings and 
gatherings.
Bootstrapping
Startup entrepreneurs should be experts in bootstrapping. As mentioned 
before, I think the best way to ruin a startup is to give it a lot of money. This 
may sound illogical, but I have seen it happen firsthand with my own projects. 
The ones that eventually turned profitable always limped along on limited 
private finances for a longer time than I would have liked, then slowly turned 
profitable, and then accelerated along the “hockey stick” (see Figure  3-1). 
Because the changes are exponential, it is impossible to spot them at the 
beginning. Over time, as they compound, growth reaches the upward sloping 
part of the hockey stick and explodes.

The flat part is necessary in order to iron out the business model, market 
approach, and financial model. Last but not least, you gain clarity about whether 
you and your co-founders wish to continue this venture. The groundwork for 
your future business success starts in the tough times of the flat hockey stick. 
The accelerating part is when you experience the fun and payoff. Without the 
flat part, long-term success will be impossible. If your goal is just about making 
a quick buck, then entrepreneurship is the wrong avenue. You need to learn 
important lessons about your venture and about yourself first. These insights 
will last you a lifetime.

The learning experience that comes with entrepreneurship is another reason 
having wealthy parents or early funding is a disadvantage for the bootstrap-
ping entrepreneur. It steals the thunder of being inventive and robs you of the 
ability to make do with little or no means. A successful serial entrepreneur I 
know had an incredible drive in his first self-funded venture, launching product 
after product in a 24-hour release cycle. After selling the first startup in the 
low nine-figures, he embarked on his next tech venture, which immediately 
attracted multimillion-dollar venture capital. But instead of losing sleep fret-
ting together with the team about ideas for the next MVP, he phoned in from 
the racetrack (he had taken up sports-car racing) and only showed up at the 
office once a week. The entrepreneurial fire was obviously gone. The venture 
did OK, but it was a mere shadow of the first company. Early funding puts you 
right in this second category. You lose your edge over all the hungry entrepre-
neurs who must make it work on a shoestring. If you are really interested in 
learning the ropes of entrepreneurship, there is no way around experiencing 
the long, flat part of the hockey stick.
Ideally, you should wrap the initial stage of your startup into an existing engage-
ment, such as an ongoing research commitment or postdoc. It is best to start 
with hypothesis testing without having to scramble for a roof over your head. 
Most universities are open to letting their research teams start a business 
with their ideas, and they even encourage them to do so. If you are straight-
forward about your plans, others will support you. Make sure the university is 
on board with your idea. Then use its infrastructure 24/7.
Make a Good First Impression
I cannot stress enough how important good manners and being presentable 
are in business. Startup entrepreneurs play in the league of the business world 
rather than the academic world. They should therefore adopt the style that 
will brand them as businesspeople. Yes, Mark Zuckerberg wears flip-flops and 
a bathrobe for meetings with venture capital firms, but he is probably the 
lone exception. Extremely few entrepreneurs have been able to engage other 
companies, investors, and venture capitalists by dressing down and celebrating 
the student image. Of course, nobody asks you to wear a suit and tie to your 
lab. But how about a polo shirt instead of a t-shirt? That simple shift alone can 
make a huge difference. You can still wear tennis shoes, but they should be 
clean, without holes. By all means, wear something comfortable, but please do 
not show up in your pajamas. If you dislike wearing a business suit, fine. Wear 
dark jeans or khakis and a dress shirt. Or a longer skirt and a blouse. Please, 
leave the athletic pants and the Adidas flip-flops at home. You never know 
when unexpected visitors will drop by, and you never know who they may 
be. They may be distant descendants of the royal family, looking to invest in a 
university startup. You never know when a government delegation may tour 
the building, and you will have the opportunity to give a little presentation

about your current development. Not only will you make a better impression, 
but you will feel more on par with the people you present to. When you feel 
underdressed, you lack the confidence to inspire others.
A brief word about language. For some reason, in some parts of the world, 
it has become fashionable to use obscene language in everyday conversation 
as if there was nothing to it. If you are an entrepreneur, this is not for you, 
because you wish to be taken seriously by the business and investor commu-
nity. You may think this advice is overly conservative and patronizing. However, 
the majority of businesspeople and those in decision-making positions at ven-
ture capital firms will appreciate it if you refrain from using gutter language. 
They may use this or that word once in a while themselves, but their language 
is generally cultivated.
The tricky part about language is that you may think you can adjust easily 
to different settings depending on who you are talking to. Unfortunately, 
this is not true. As soon as you establish some rapport with other people, 
you will drop your guard. If you normally use profanities, they will roll off 
your tongue without you noticing it. Just as with being late, nobody will tell 
you to please watch your language. But they may subconsciously feel that 
your startup still needs more development, or that they preferred another 
entrepreneur who made a more professional impression. Give third parties 
as few reasons as possible to reject you. One of them is proper language. No 
need to emulate Prince Charles but f-words and any derogatory language 
have no place in business.
I once introduced a friend in Los Angeles to an attorney I had worked with 
previously. I thought she might be interested in an invention my friend was 
working on. So I set up a lunch for the three of us to see if there was some 
common ground. Having known my friend for a while, I had somewhat gotten 
used to his rough language and liberal use of f-bombs. Naively, I assumed that 
he would control himself in a business meeting. Was I ever mistaken. F-bombs 
were flying in the chic cafe in Venice Beach, over seared ahi tuna salad and 
sugar-free ice tea. F- this, and f- that, this f---ing m-----f---r, what a f---ing idiot, 
and so on. He talked himself into a frenzy. In his view, people were out to get 
him, and they should all be f----d. This was obviously the first and last time I 
introduced this guy to anyone. Not only was his behavior blatantly rude, but 
he also sabotaged himself—and it reflected terribly on me. You cannot tell 
a grown man in front of others to watch his language. After he left, I had to 
profusely apologize to the lawyer from Beverly Hills, who commented that the 
guy was quite intense, in her own words. That introduction led nowhere. My 
friend failed to get his project off the ground. And the next one. And the one 
after that. It’s a pity, because some of his ideas were good and could have taken 
off. By all means, do not be that guy.

In addition to avoiding gutter language, you should avoid speaking negatively 
about others. Think twice before you talk down about your competitors in 
their absence. In fact, never speak ill of anyone, except to their face. Recounting 
the calamities that have happened to you is also unattractive. Avoid stories 
about how you were sick over the weekend and spent most of it in the bath-
room. Put yourself in the other person’s shoes: would you like to spend time 
with someone who mainly speaks about things you would rather never have 
happen to you? Or would you prefer someone with an upbeat outlook on 
life who sees the opportunity in everything? By no means am I advocating 
that you fashion yourself into a careless Pollyanna. But there exists a magical 
balance between being a realist and having a positive outlook. Start observing 
the impact it has on you when someone won’t stop telling you about their 
problems and mishaps. It creates a climate of negativity that drags everything 
down. It’s better to see the bright side of things and avoid dark topics. This 
makes a better impression on others, especially in your first meeting.
Doing Business Abroad
If your university has a campus in a foreign country, then you may already be 
familiar with the idiosyncrasies that different cultures bring with them. Asian 
cultures in particular often stump the American or European visitor with 
their many intricacies. As a student, consequences of severe mishaps may be 
minimal; but for an entrepreneur, a misstep can break your venture. Business 
culture is rigid in some countries, whereas it is relaxed in others. Become 
familiar with the business etiquette of your locale. As a foreigner, nobody calls 
on you to do everything right. If it seems as though you genuinely care, then 
you are in the green and small mistakes will matter less. There are numerous 
books about conducting business abroad. Read one about the country where 
you are a guest. Even if you think you already know everything, the dos and 
don’ts may surprise you.
A key custom is the act of greeting. Each country has its own protocol. Some 
religions may forbid a man to shake a woman’s hand. People may dislike it if 
you hug them cordially. But others will find it strange if you refuse to par-
ticipate in the ritual of three kisses on their cheeks. Familiarize yourself with 
the greeting protocol if you engage with partners from a foreign culture. It is 
usually easy enough to ask someone before the meeting about how things will 
unfold. You can then copy what others do. It has always been a good practice 
to wait on a handshake until the other party extends their hand. If they don’t, 
then you do whatever they do: either bow or nod.
The same goes for food. You will rarely have an important business lunch 
or dinner where table etiquette is so exotic that you are at your wit’s end. 
Most lunch meetings are informal. But occasionally you may unexpectedly find 
yourself at a banquet. If this happens, copy what everybody else is doing. If you 

Chapter 3 | What Does It Mean to Be a Startup Entrepreneur?
40
are being served food, then let that happen, without refusing any of it. Nobody 
expects you to eat everything that is put before you, but rejecting food is seen 
as very impolite in many cultures.
A few years ago, a company of mine entered in a joint venture with a Japanese 
company. When the business relationship was forming, the Japanese partner 
flew my firm from Los Angeles to Tokyo for a week to hammer out the legal 
agreements. One of the partners in the American business, let’s call him J, had 
a tattoo of the Chinese character “love” on his forearm. This may have been 
cute in Los Angeles, but in Japan, only Yakuza and other delinquents bear tat-
toos. Foreigners are often unaware that a tattoo reflects badly on the person in 
Japan. In the Japanese view, tattoos violate the body, and they are a reflection of 
low self-esteem. In a negotiation, you obviously need to make the best impres-
sion possible and come from a position of strength. To negotiate with Japanese 
businesspeople is tricky enough, to say it mildly. The last thing you want is the 
other party perceiving you as flawed and weak. I advised J of that and suggested 
he wear a long-sleeved business shirt to cover the tattoo. Knowing he had a 
stubborn personality, I doubled up and sent him an article from a book that 
explained the problem. With that, I considered the issue closed. Fast-forward 
two weeks. We are seated in the conference room in Tokyo: three people from 
my company on one side of the table, five older Japanese businessmen on the 
other side of the table. Negotiations are not going well. The Japanese repeat-
edly say, “Just sign the contract!” That contract contains blatant flaws and is a 
long way from I want for my business. But most important, J’s tattoo is shining 
brightly for everyone to see. Not only that, but his cowboy boots and the rolled-
up sleeves of his flannel shirt give the impression that he comes right from the 
farm in Ohio. He certainly made his point that nobody can tell him what to do 
with his tattoo or what to wear. Yet how can a settled Japanese businessperson 
in a tailored suit consider a person looking like a farmhand an equal partner in 
a joint venture? I certainly am no micro manager. But dressing properly for a 
business meeting is a basic requirement when negotiating a contract. After much 
wrestling, the deal eventually came to pass, in the least elegant way possible. The 
business later turned sour, and I exited before it tanked. I am not blaming that on 
J. However, the foundation for a strong future of that joint venture was missing. It 
could have started in that first meeting, had the other party taken us seriously.
This concludes the crash course in manners. Read a book about business eti-
quette, and you will be all right.
A Mindset, Not a Job
Entrepreneurship is much more a mindset than a job. It is about finding open-
ings and possibility where others don’t. If you look at the world through the 
entrepreneur’s eyes, you will suddenly see many opportunities that you pre-
viously missed. Opportunities to get feedback from others to assist you in

moving your idea forward. Opportunities for partnerships that open new plat-
forms for you. And opportunities to save money wherever you can. You can 
be entrepreneurial in any line of work, not just as a startup founder.
The main point is that an entrepreneur needs to switch from being a con-
sumer to being a producer. What does that mean? Producers have new ideas, 
come up with innovative solutions, and launch products and services that 
consumers cannot live without. Consumers benefit from these ideas: they 
need the new solutions and buy the products or services the producers offer. 
Of course, everybody is both a producer and a consumer at the same time. 
On balance, however, an entrepreneur should be more producer than con-
sumer. This is a tricky topic, and by no means is this a value judgment. But 
it is important to understand that startup entrepreneurship shifts you from 
the consumer side to the producer side. This is intuitively clear, because a 
startup produces a product or service for the benefit of clients in the market.  
You provide a product or service instead of consuming one.
This shift is fundamental and will eventually seep into other areas of your life. 
You can no longer take the easy way out, but have to meet challenges with 
leadership. Instead of blaming others for a botched job at your company, you 
must now take on full responsibility, because there is no one else to point 
fingers at. Instead of trying to carry out a task, you must deliver, whatever it 
takes. Instead of partying the whole weekend and calling in sick on Monday, 
you must be a professional, always ready to pull the trigger when a lucky 
chance presents itself. It may be inconvenient, but if it helps get your startup 
off the ground, you should jump on it.
As an entrepreneur, you are always on. Most people are no startup entrepre-
neurs and are firmly rooted on the consumer side, so making the switch is dif-
ficult. Why do you keep talking about business when everybody else is trying 
to forget the day at the office after five o’clock rolls around? When you see 
your startup as a mission, then there are no business hours. It takes willpower 
and determination to stay the course. Otherwise, you may miss an opportu-
nity that could potentially launch your venture into the stratosphere. To adopt 
an entrepreneurial mindset, it is of course very helpful to surround yourself 
with other entrepreneurs. These are your peers, from whom you can learn by 
osmosis. When you have access to a supportive group of businesspeople, then 
over time you will see how they do things and approach certain situations and 
learn what it takes to get your startup off the ground.
Get Out of Your Comfort Zone
As an entrepreneur, you must learn to be open about life and its opportuni-
ties. These often present themselves in the least likely places. What do you do 
if a project is only somewhat in line with what you can or want to deliver, but 

Chapter 3 | What Does It Mean to Be a Startup Entrepreneur?

it has the potential to get you closer to a company you would like to enter a 
joint venture with? By all means, take on the project, even if doing so is a little 
uncomfortable at first.
One day, a casual acquaintance from a business workshop called my company 
in Switzerland and asked me to put together some documentation for a cer-
tain sound system for a store his architecture firm was working on. This had 
little to do with the core business of my company, but sound systems are a 
hobby of mine. I did some research, called a manufacturer to order a catalog, 
and then sent everything to the architect. With this documentation, he went 
to meet his client. Rather unexpectedly, I then received a phone call with a 
request to calculate the exact cost of the system. So, I made another call to 
the manufacturer and created a table in Excel. I thought of this as nothing but 
a favor to another businessman. A week or so later, the architect called me 
excitedly and congratulated me on landing the project. What project, I won-
dered? It turned out that his firm was remodeling the stores of a mini-super-
market chain, which wanted to install sound systems in each store. Because 
the documentation I had put together looked professional, he was under the 
impression that I was a dealer of these sound systems. His client approved of 
using the system I had researched and wanted to order it from my company. 
Well … sure, we could deliver that! All I had to do was ask the wholesaler to 
drop-ship a system to each location. Local electricians then carried out the 
installation under the architect’s supervision. My company’s markup on each 
system was $1,000. There were 500 stores in total. Feel free to do the math.
When I met this architect, did I know that he would turn out to be an impor-
tant business contact who would eventually secure a substantial project for 
my company? Far from it. I had never thought about collaborations with archi-
tects, but I was curious to find out about his projects in the workshop where 
we met. The conversation went well, so we exchanged business cards. At 
networking events, you can always learn something new and meet people you 
would rarely otherwise be exposed to. Networking events are more than a 
free buffet and a chance to pick up girls. When you launch a startup, you have 
graduated to adulthood and should see networking events in a new light. I 
know, it can be uncomfortable to introduce yourself to strangers. Making 
small talk is also not my forte. Nevertheless, if you make it a habit to get out 
of your comfort zone regularly, you will acquire an important skill for success. 
Your university may put on some sort of catered event for a delegation from 
industry or the government. Instead of loading up your plate and then hud-
dling around a table with your fellow researchers, do something different this 
time. Look for a table with just a few people, and introduce yourself. Ask what 
brings them to the event, and find out what they are doing. Exchange busi-
ness cards. Tell them about your startup and the current insights you’ve had 
or the challenges you are struggling with. Ask for their feedback and whether 
they may know someone interested in your technology. Make outrageous 

University Startups and Spin-Offs
43
demands. Do they perhaps know an investor or a joint venture partner for 
your startup? Or would they be willing to assist you with testing your MVP? 
See what happens. You never know what will come out of these encounters.
Building a strong network is important for the future of your startup. You may 
meet someone in a few months who could benefit from a casual connection 
you made last week at a networking event. Once you have connected with 
enough people, you can begin linking them up with your existing network. This 
is fun to do and will do more than benefit those you introduce to each other. 
When you need somebody’s help, you may also tap into their network. Before 
you know it, you are part of an active exchange of contacts and ideas. And all 
this happens because you leave your comfort zone once in a while.
Read and Improve
Most successful entrepreneurs are voracious readers. They constantly read 
books, publications, and the news to keep on top of what is happening in the 
world. This concerns topics beyond existing domain knowledge, about which 
I assume you are already an expert. Knowledge is power, and startup entre-
preneurs need all the power they can get. You need to expand your horizon 
with knowledge from outside your field of vision. In addition to absorbing all 
the information you can to solve your current challenges, also read books 
that have no obvious application to the situation. If you need to find a solution 
to an issue with a certain material, then do the required reading along with a 
biography about Nicola Tesla. Far-flung ideas may cross-pollinate the problem-
solving process, and they may originate in the least expected places. If you 
read one sentence somewhere that holds the answer to a pressing problem, 
your life may change forever. You cannot expect to have that one sentence 
presented to you on a silver platter. To distill the wisdom that is useful for you, 
you need process large amounts of information yourself.
It is surprising how few books people read after their college years. Even 
some smart people proudly announce they have read the last book a decade 
ago. Sure, they may browse the news online, scan some RSS subscriptions, and 
academic publications here and there, but systematic reading with the goal 
of massive knowledge acquisition is rare. Not among the successful entre-
preneurial elite, though, who practice it as a daily habit. By the way, I am not 
talking about reading novels, but nonfiction books. Imagine you read one such 
book each week. That would be 52 books in a year. Quite a sizable library. 
I doubt most people read 52 books in their entire life. Here is a knowledge 
advantage you can gain in a single year. With speed-reading techniques you can 
read two or even three books per week. That amounts to a whopping 156 
books by the end of the year and 1,560 books after 10 years.

Chapter 3 | What Does It Mean to Be a Startup Entrepreneur?
44
The reason I prefer books to other written material is that you enter a con-
versation with the author. It takes about one year to write a complete book. 
Considerable research and knowledge condensation go into the process. The 
author recounts many experiences for your learning pleasure. When you read 
a book, you absorb a whole year of somebody’s work. With speed reading, 
you can assimilate in one year what 156 people took an entire year of their 
life to compile. This 156X multiplier is incredible leverage.
Whenever I read a book or a research paper, I make a summary. It consists 
of bullet points and some of the most important drawings or graphs from 
the book. At the end of the summary, I do some quick brainstorming about 
how the ideas from the book are applicable to my current circumstances. I 
strongly encourage you to do the same. Even though it is extra work, you will 
benefit hugely from having summaries of what you have read. It enables you 
to review your reading later and quickly look up the most important ideas. 
Who has ever read a 400-page book twice, or three times? I revisit most of 
my summaries at least once a month so they stay fresh in my mind, ready for 
use when I need ideas. When you have your own summaries, you can also 
share them with others. Exchange summaries with like-minded individuals. 
When you progress along your entrepreneurial journey, you will be surprised 
to learn that many successful entrepreneurs are doing exactly this and have 
done it for years. Only the relatively passive mainstream prefers watching TV 
to knowledge acquisition.
To become excellent, you should avoid all things that make you mainstream. 
When you are picking up new, positive habits, they rarely seem to make a big 
difference at first. But over time, when your efforts compound, you will pull 
away increasingly quickly. After several years of knowledge acquisition, there 
will be a huge gap between you and the mainstream and a much smaller gap 
between you and successful entrepreneurs. To achieve success, you need to 
do the things that successful people do. Reading a lot and putting that informa-
tion in context with your situation is just one of them.
Then there is the subject of self-improvement. I know, you may think this is 
soft and only applicable for esoteric types. But all successful people engage in 
one form or another of self-improvement. Perhaps adopting a new positive 
habit, like getting up at 5:30 am every day. Or learning a new language just for 
fun. Or improving their working memory with N-back programs. They do 
little things each day that push them a bit. Self-improvement is much more 
than meditation and yoga. If you go to the gym regularly, that’s a form of self-
improvement. If you deny yourself that second piece of cake, that’s another 
form of self-improvement. And if you read a book every day for 30 minutes, 
that’s also self-improvement. This has little to do with seeking enlightenment, 
but with adopting positive habits. When those habits have become part of 
your day like brushing your teeth or taking a shower, they have the power to 
help you achieve your goals without even thinking about them.

So how can you get in the habit of reading more to accelerate your learning? 
Begin by scheduling daily reading sessions. Make a regular, recurring appoint-
ment at some time during the day to read a nonfiction book for 30 minutes. 
Or put the item on your daily to-do list. It is in your own best interest to fol-
low through on this commitment.
Get Used to Big Numbers
When you manage a business, you must begin getting used to bigger numbers. 
What does that mean? Well, if your profit margin on each product sold is 
$100 and your potential market size is 1 million, then that will amount to 
$100 million in profit. Can you imagine such a number? Yes? Good. Feel free 
to skip this chapter. But you may feel slightly queasy when talking about capi-
talist concepts like profit, margin, and sales revenue. You may think $1 million 
is an enormous amount of money. If anyone asks you about your revenue 
target in five years, you may feel uncomfortable if it is more than $5 million. If 
this is the case, you are not alone. Startup entrepreneurs rarely come from a 
background where they received early education about money. The financial 
literacy of most people around the world is limited. If there is more month at 
the end of the money, then they notice that they have overspent; otherwise, 
budget planning has no mindshare.
Financial intelligence has nothing to do with IQ. The smartest people can 
make terrible financial decisions. And some people who have never gone to 
school have amassed fortunes. Nobody expects you to become a financial 
planner or financial analyst, but you should at least get comfortable with big-
ger numbers. When you deal with corporations, you will notice that they have 
another definition of revenue and cost. Hundreds of millions may be cheap for 
a corporation, compared to their other overhead.
Once upon a time, a company of mine was working on a project for an airline. 
Our contribution was small, but the entire project, handled by a large consult-
ing firm, cost several million dollars. We thought our part should be worth 
$30,000, because it only involved a limited engagement for a week or so. The 
big meeting took place on the top floor of the client’s corporate headquarters, 
right next to the airport. The decision maker and his staff sat around the con-
ference table in tailored suits and silk ties. When the time came to approve 
the budget, he addressed me and asked, “So, about your budget item here. 
This is in addition to your other $30,000, am I correct?” Somebody must have 
made a mistake and entered our fee twice in the overall budget. Honest as I 
am, I cleared up the confusion, only to notice a hint of disappointment on the 
face of the airline man. Oh, I see. It’s that cheap … I am sure those were his 
thoughts. To me, $30,000 hardly seemed little at all. However, the airline man 
would not have blinked had that fee been twice as big. It might even have been 
OK to charge $100,000.

Chapter 3 | What Does It Mean to Be a Startup Entrepreneur?

Budget items need to make sense in relation to other items. If all the other 
items are $100,000 or more, then yours should be in a similar range. If the 
overall budget is several million, then adjust accordingly. But wait a minute, 
you say. You would charge a company twice the cost that another company 
paid, just because their budget is higher? Yes, absolutely. Your markup should 
adjust to the capability of the market. Price is a result of the ability and willing-
ness to pay and has little to do with the manufacturing cost of the product or 
service. This is called price differentiation in economics. It is what hotels do all 
the time. Booking directly on their site may cost 50% more than booking on 
a discount web site. It is the same room—the only difference is the margin a 
particular customer is willing to pay. What if you sell a product with a fixed 
price? Then you will always have a dominant market to which you tailor your 
margin. If you cannot sell your inventory, that’s when you begin reducing the 
price and your margin. As a rule, choose a market that can pay a high price for 
your product or service. Marketing to them and delivering the product takes 
the same effort as catering to a low-cost market. As a startup, you should 
attempt to extract the highest price you can. To do this, you have to think in 
large numbers.
Many startups project their future revenues way too low. If you believe you 
will hit $3 million in sales in the third year, then you are thinking too small. 
Look for markets and business models that will allow you to make $100 mil-
lion, $500 million, $1 billion. This market size is interesting for joint venture 
partners and investors. Do a little research about other companies. Speak 
with some investors. Read books about how venture capitalists think. Watch 
the movie Wall Street.7 Direct your thinking toward larger numbers, and seek 
out projects that can help your startup gain momentum. If you provide a ser-
vice and a project pays just $1,000, seriously think about whether you should 
go ahead or decline it. If it puts you in the same room with people who could 
help you land bigger projects in the future, that may be a reason to take a 
bath on the first project and then engage the client toward larger projects. If 
you can wrap some MVP testing into the project, that may be another reason 
to accept a low-paid assignment. But steer clear of making this a habit. If you 
keep doing small projects, then you will always be the small-projects company. 
Clients will rarely consider you for larger projects, because you have pigeon-
holed yourself into the inexpensive category. Your work should never be inex-
pensive or cheap. Abandon clients who think it should be. Nobody wins when 
you set the sights too low for your startup.

80% Specialist, 20% Generalist
How often have you heard the following phrase? “Only do what you are an 
expert in, and outsource all the rest.” This is a common pattern for business-
people, but it misses the point of what startup entrepreneurship is all about. 
Sure, you should avoid wasting time with tasks that someone else can do 
much better, faster, and for a lower price. Should Tiger Woods mow his own 
lawn?8 He spends a lot of time walking around on grass and may therefore 
have profound knowledge about the dimensions of a golf course. Tiger would 
most likely be more efficient with a lawnmower than a normal gardener, but 
his opportunity cost is much too high to be doing that. In the time it takes him 
to mow the lawn, he could earn a million dollars doing a photo shoot.
Despite the economic concept of opportunity cost explained with this classic 
textbook example, you need to know how to pull yourself out of a sticky situ-
ation or deadline when there is no help around the corner. Therefore, being 
ignorant about anything outside your expert domain is a bad strategy for a 
startup entrepreneur.
Recently, I was working on a project where we had five days to prepare a 
40-page printed and bound brochure for an investment proposal. A decision 
maker on another continent needed this information, so the deadline was 
firm, and the presentation determined the future of the project. This may not 
sound like much. But since that project had started, about 100 folders with 
countless articles, diagrams, summaries, and PowerPoint presentations had 
been accumulated on three people’s hard drives and Dropboxes. The founders 
now needed to revisit everything and pick out the most important bits. The 
brochure had to measure up to others whose teams had spent six months 
getting everything right. If you have ever put together an annual report, then 
you know that this usually takes much longer than a week. We had five days to 
condense all the information, write an executive summary, and make a profes-
sional layout in Adobe InDesign. A printer would then bind three copies of the 
brochure, which had to look glossy and flawless. Somebody knew a graphic 
designer who was available on such short notice, who flew in to do the layout. 
Straight off the plane, she raced to the office on Thursday morning, where 
we put her in front of a PowerBook that was preloaded with all the assets 
and had the layout software already running. The deadline for the printer was 
Friday noon, 26 hours away. Let the fun begin.
Many unforeseen issues arose. The first was the keyboard of the computer. 
Because the designer was used to a foreign layout, she found our PowerBook 
with the QWERTY layout very confusing. Luckily she had her own machine 
with her, so all the assets were hurriedly copied to her hard disk. In the

transfer to her laptop, which had a different software version and was  
missing some fonts, settings in the file were changed. The layout template 
looked completely different from what we imagined. That was the moment 
when it became apparent that the designer was much less proficient in work-
ing with the layout software than expected. Sure, she had done motion design 
and stunning Photoshop and Illustrator work, but laying out a brochure was a 
first. With 20 hours to go until the deadline, it dawned on us that this would 
be anything but smooth sailing.
On Friday morning at 11 am (one hour before the deadline), the file was still 
unfinished. Working around the clock, the designer was in no shape to spot 
errors and typos. One of the founders sort of knew his way around the layout 
program, so he troubleshot the most blatant issues right in the printing com-
pany’s office. With everybody hunched around the computer screen, pointing 
out a missing image credit here or a wrong description for a graph there, the 
file finally went to print. Five hours later, we picked up the bound brochures. 
They looked like a million bucks and were soon on their way to Europe. The 
goal was accomplished, just in the nick of time. Nobody who saw the final 
product would ever know that it was up in the air until the last second and 
only came together thanks to lucky circumstances.
Do you believe this would have worked out if the founders had concentrated 
on the high-value task of concepts and product development, and let the 
designer deal with the supposedly low-value task of the layout job? For the 
entrepreneur, the high-value task is getting the job done, whatever it takes. In 
this case, it meant knowing how to use that layout software and staying up to 
motivate the designer to keep the pace. Finishing what must be done takes 
the mindset of a generalist, and entrepreneurs must put on more than one 
hat. From this viewpoint, the notion of outsourcing everything but the tasks 
with the highest payoff is terrible advice for a startup. If you care about noth-
ing else than your one area of expertise, you will be at a disadvantage when 
things veer off course, as they often do.
It is difficult to identify which tasks are of high or low value in the first place. Is 
touch-typing low or high value? I have seen too many C-level executives des-
perately trying to knock out a 100-word letter with two fingers when their 
speech recognition software refused to work. How about basic web design 
and using WordPress? When an important potential joint venture partner asks 
you to forward your online documentation to her team, it may be impossible 
to hire someone to set up a web site for you in an hour. Make sure you know 
your way around more than one thing. Diverse skills can help you directly and 
can create considerable goodwill for you when you get others out of a tight 
spot. This is why constant learning and reading are so important. Become 80% 
specialist and 20% generalist. You will rarely need your generalist knowledge 
every day, but it may come in handy when you expect it least.

How to Learn Something New
Did you learn something new in the last month? A few words of a new language, 
juggling, or how to stay under water for more than 60 seconds? Life is learn-
ing, so the saying goes. If you think learning stops after your graduate degree, 
then you are missing many opportunities right in front of you. Curiosity and 
an open mind are indispensable for entrepreneurs. You should make it a habit 
to acquire new skills at all times. This benefits you personally—plus you never 
know when you can help somebody out of a bind with a skill you possess.
A splendid example of an easy-to-learn skill is touch-typing. Most people believe 
this is unimportant, because they can always hack their way through a paper 
using two fingers. Speech-to-text software is also often used, and it makes the 
keyboard unnecessary. As long as the software works, that is. When you can 
type fast without errors, you can translate your thoughts into the computer 
at such speed that a new world of possibilities opens up for you. You can blog 
about your company and your progress, write manuals or reports about MVP 
testing you did, or write a book about your trials and tribulations as an entre-
preneur. If typing is a dreaded activity you would rather outsource, then you 
will subconsciously try to avoid anything that has to do with it. If rapid new 
skill acquisition sounds intriguing to you, and you still type with two fingers, 
then I recommend you put touch-typing on the top of your list.
Wait a minute, you say. What about the 10,000-hour rule? Author Malcolm 
Gladwell found that experts in their domain practiced an average of 10,000 
hours until they achieved world-class levels. Studying prodigies like Bill Gates, 
Tiger Woods, famous musicians, and chess grandmasters, Gladwell found that 
none of them were geniuses when they started out. Only after about ten 
years of single-minded, deliberate practice of their chosen skills did their hard 
work pay off. Ten years equate to about 10,000 productive hours. The rule 
states that mastery in any field requires 10,000 hours of practice.9
Research has shown that success comes down to deliberate practice much 
more than innate talent. Even prodigies like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart pro-
duced dismal works in their early years. Only after diligent study were they 
able to reach the status the world knows them for.10 With this in mind, it 
seems as though you could never learn anything new that you would not be 
mediocre at. Who has ten years available to engage in single-minded study of 
just one skill? At the same time, many people learn languages well into adult-
hood. They pick up a complex game like golf long before they put in 10,000 
hours. There is no need to compete with Tiger Woods on the golf course or 
with Mozart on the piano—just play well enough to have fun.

Author Josh Kaufman found that a minimum of 20 hours of concentrated, 
deliberate practice is necessary to feel the first improvements when learning 
a new skill.11 By putting aside 1 hour each evening for 20 days for deliberate 
practice, you can improve any skill you set your mind to. The word deliberate 
is important. Just reading about a subject does not count. Nor does attending 
a seminar about it. A passive activity is not deliberate practice and does not 
qualify toward those 20 hours. Most of us forget what practice means after 
childhood. If you learned to play an instrument well, then you know what 
deliberate practice means: endless repetitions of the most difficult part of a 
piece of music, under the watchful eyes of a teacher who criticizes your every 
mistake.
Applying this kind of practice to new skills is key to becoming good at them. 
When you can manage that, you will be able to pick up a new skill with accept-
able results within 20 hours. You will be able to show some ability, but you 
will hardly be a master who can compete with the best of the best. For most 
of us, this is unnecessary. Being good enough at a skill to avoid frustration is 
all we want.
I recently learned touch-typing while I was in Vietnam. I had my own typing 
system before, using more than two fingers; but without looking at the key-
board, I failed to produce satisfactory results. Replacing this haphazard system 
with professional ten-finger touch-typing was as simple as blocking out one 
hour each evening for typing practice for 20 days. Using software to learn typ-
ing, I can now produce 70 words per minute with few errors. Sure, this is a far 
cry from the world record of 216 words per minute. However, it is plenty to 
write this book without frustration and exhaustion. Touch-typing is the ideal 
first skill to learn in 20 hours. I recommend you look into it.
Begin getting into the habit of practicing new skills regularly. As you saw in 
the specialist/generalist discussion, there are various useful skills that startup 
entrepreneurs should know. These reach beyond intellectual or computer 
skills. Also pick up fun skills like riding a unicycle or kickboxing. Make it a 
habit to be enterprising and curious, instead of passive and withdrawn. Be 
interested, to be interesting. Just like the knowledge you will gain from reading 
extensively, your newfound powers will accumulate over time and build on 
each other. That takes a while, so you need to start early to reap the benefits 
later. You need to practice several years to be an overnight success.

Who to Turn to for Advice
Entrepreneurship can be a confusing and lonely affair, especially when your 
environment consists of people with a strong need for safety and predictabil-
ity. These may be your professors, fellow students and researchers, parents, 
friends, and significant others. Asking non-entrepreneurs for their opinion 
about your startup and advice to solve certain problems can be frustrating. 
Not only do they lack the experience to actually help you, but there is also the 
risk that they will (subconsciously) try to dissuade you from your plans. They 
have never started their own company and probably have nobody in their 
circle who has, so they are hardly the right people to call for advice. Of course, 
please keep your old friends. Enjoy their company and have a good time with 
them, but look for qualified startup and business advice elsewhere.
The same goes for the experts in commercialization at your university, the 
technology transfer or licensing office (TTO or TLO). By definition, they are 
thinking about patents when it comes to commercializing research. If your 
startup has no patentable assets, they will be at their wits’ end. In the rarest 
cases, will they admit that. They may point you toward the grant track and gov-
ernment agency XYZ, which has been set up to guide young entrepreneurs in 
the “correct” direction. Someone at the TLO may have taken a crash course 
in entrepreneurship at a seminar. However, because that is purely theoretical, 
you may as well read a book—you will know just as much. Good intentions 
are at the root of most of the current support programs, but startups that 
take off have seldom gone through these conventional channels. If it was that 
easy and predictable, there would be many more successful companies coming 
out of academia and government programs, don’t you think?
When you meet venture capitalists and other investors, inquire about their 
practical experience and their track record before you ask them for entre-
preneurship and business advice. Have they ever started their own company? 
Has the company achieved profitability? No and no? Then think for your-
self why you should trust their advice. It is perfectly OK to ask direct ques-
tions like these. When a venture capitalist becomes serious about investing in 
your company, they will grill you about anything and everything. As a rule of 
thumb, ask yourself why people are doing whatever they do. If they could run 
their own successful company, they probably had better options than working 
somewhere 9–5.
Successful entrepreneurs are much better qualified to guide you than any-
one else. Seek out other successful startup founders in your city or country 
and become friends with them. Use the Internet to connect if there are no 
networking events or meetups in your city. Make it a point to upgrade your 
personal network. Exchanging ideas with other startup founders and estab-
lished entrepreneurs is stimulating and inspiring for you and your team. Most

entrepreneurs, myself included, are happy to give advice if they feel the per-
son asking for it has drive and motivation. They recognize earlier versions of 
themselves in people who ask them questions. Openly approach other entre-
preneurs and ask if they can give you feedback on your ideas. Most of the time 
they will accept, and a new friendship may be in the making.
Why Even Bother?
By now, you may have decided that launching a startup is interesting but too 
invasive in your life and hardly worth the hassle. Perhaps you hoped you could 
somehow start a new business on the side without much effort. Why bother, 
if it is so grueling and uncertain? Why not simply take on a cushy position at a 
university? After all, that is what everybody else is doing, so it cannot be that 
bad.
Sure, the temptation to give up is there. When things are on the rocks, it will 
become even stronger. Regardless, be aware that real change always originates 
from a determined entrepreneurial mind. Entrepreneurship is pretty much 
the only way for anyone to have a chance to change the world. Working as a 
researcher may lead to groundbreaking insights, but rarely do they find their 
way into the lives and hearts of people. Teaching at a university may instill cer-
tain knowledge in motivated students, but it is by starting your own company 
that you can make a real impact. Not everybody has to reach for the sky and 
try to make their mark. It is perfectly OK for most people to work a normal 
job, enjoy the weekends with their friends and family, and lead a quiet, com-
fortable life. There is nothing wrong with that.
However, you may lie awake some nights with the gnawing feeling there should 
be more to your life. You notice the lack of a deeper mission and purpose. 
You feel you are on a treadmill, failing to live up to your potential. You wonder 
if you are making enough use of your talents and your energy. Your work at 
the university never leaves the ivory tower and has no impact in people’s lives 
outside academia. Later you fall asleep. The next morning, you have largely 
forgotten those silly thoughts, which you blame on insomnia and stress. But 
they return—regularly, and at shorter intervals. What to do in this situation is 
unclear to you, because the necessary changes seem so sweeping and impos-
sible that you better forget about them. Does this sound at all familiar?
Not everybody asks these questions, but chances are you do, because you 
have picked up this book and are still reading it. If you feel you should make 
better use of your talents, then launching your own company may be the 
answer for you. Your deep understanding of a certain technology can find its 
way into a useful product with the power to transform lives. How about giving 
your mind the platform to express itself fully and make an impact in the world 
at the same time?

There is a whimsical Japanese movie by Akira Kurosawa, called Ikiru (“To 
Live”).12 The protagonist, Watanabe, has spent the last few decades in a gov-
ernment agency where he has advanced to the respected position of section 
chief. His work consists of little more than stamping papers and shuffling proj-
ect proposals from one desk to the next until they disappear into a drawer. 
One day he receives devastating news: he has stomach cancer. He will die 
within the next six months. Watanabe wakes up to the fact that he has done 
nothing important with his life up to this day. He sets out on a search for mean-
ing and makes it his mission to see through at least one project: a proposal to 
turn a festering sewage pond into a park. This proposal has been repeatedly 
submitted by residents who suffer from the sewage pond near their homes, 
but it is sent from section to section, and the government does not intend to 
take action. But this is no longer how Watanabe does his job. He scratches 
and claws his way through the bureaucracy, through a thicket of complacency 
and corruption, up to the highest positions. Most of his colleagues think he is 
crazy and will never prevail. Against all odds and through sheer will, Watanabe 
makes it work. He eventually dies a happy man in the park he helped create.
A friend of mine recently confessed that she thought there was nothing left 
to discover. All the important and fun adventures had taken place already. 
The discovery of new continents, the flight to the Moon, were all checked 
off the list. Of course, she would quit her job as a stockbroker and become 
an entrepreneur, if she could only find a satisfactory field for her startup to 
venture into. Clearly, this person had set her sights on the Hollywood version 
of entrepreneurship.
Most people think the status quo is how things are and should be for eternity. 
When the world was flat, there was no need to sail past a certain point in 
the ocean. Yet somebody did and induced a paradigm shift that set a whole 
new ideology in motion. None of these discoveries were fun and games. The 
voyages of Christopher Columbus took many years of preparation, tedious 
politics, and fundraising alone. Not only did the monarchs to whom he sent 
his plans to discover the western route to India believe them to be impracti-
cal, but they also doubted Columbus could possibly succeed. Many had tried 
before, so why should it work this time? When he finally secured permission 
and funding for his expedition, the dangerous part of the endeavor began. 
Three days into his first journey in 1492, the rudder of his vessel broke—
a potential act of sabotage. Then his crew allegedly grew so homesick that 
they threatened to sail back to Spain. It was unclear whether the indigenous 
people Columbus might encounter would be friendly toward foreign visitors. 
Had Columbus’s primary motivation been the fun and potential honor of the 
project, he would have given up after the first few weeks.

Fun and prestige are weak motivations to launch a startup. You should feel 
a burning desire to explore, learn, and make an impact in the lives of people 
who find your startup’s product or service useful. This is often little more than 
a feeling deep down that this idea could potentially be big. When you have this 
feeling, I encourage you to follow it, using the list in Figure 3-2 as a guideline. 
You can rationalize for as long as you want whether the idea will be successful. 
But if you have an inexplicable drive to make it work, chances are high that it 
will. Setting the wheels in motion without much deliberating is the best policy. 
Overcome analysis paralysis, and boldly step forward. The recommendations 
in this book will allow you to do just that.
Imagine yourself spending more time on management than creative 
tasks.
Warm up to succeeding turtle-style, not kamikaze-style.
Use your willpower to implement positive habits in your life. 
Learn to manage your time and eliminate distractions.
Upgrade your behavior from student/researcher to businessperson.
Leave your comfort zone once in a while by taking small, calculated 
risks.
Read a nonfiction book for 30 minutes daily to learn something 
new.
Make a goal of learning new general business skills that may help you 
later.

Engaging Others 
with Actionable 
Next Steps
How many times has this happened to you? A businessperson you meet at a 
networking event finds your research project interesting and wants to learn 
more about it. You exchange cards and set up a meeting in the coming week. 
The person comes to your lab, signs the NDA, and approvingly nods at your 
technology, which you present in much detail. When the hour is up, your guest 
thanks you for the time and suggests keeping in touch, especially when you 
have advanced the technology more and it is closer to implementation. The 
person then departs, never to be heard from again. You assume this person 
was not all that interested after all and chalk it up as one more pointless 
meeting.
In reality, you failed to engage the visitor properly. You were most likely 
unclear about what you wanted from the interaction in the first place. You 
showed your work, but you missed the chance to gain insight into the business 
of your visitor and the person’s challenges, expansion plans, or product 
innovations. When making a new contact, most people never research who 
that person really is, let alone read up on their present and past job history or 
personal interests. Every person has a valuable network, and when you meet 
someone, you can get access to their network. It may not be the initial con-
tact you do business with, but rather someone on the edge of that person’s 
network. Entrepreneurs must know how to use others to advance their cause. 
This is a cornerstone of entrepreneurship.

Chapter 4 | Engaging Others with Actionable Next Steps

In your dealings with those outside your university, you should begin thinking 
about engaging them with actionable next steps. They may be government 
agencies, financiers, insurance companies, businesspeople, successful entre-
preneurs, or others. At a large public university I worked with, several banks 
scheduled visits to show the impressive infrastructure of the world-renowned 
institution to their C-level staff and wealthy clients. After the first few tours, 
the managing director decided to stop the visits with the argument that his 
facility was not a zoo. With this only half-joking statement, he and his staff got 
rid of the annoying visitors, but they threw out the baby with the bathwater. 
Imagine what a good relationship with banks and their wealthy clients could 
have done for the university’s startups. Many other universities and public 
companies act the same way every day. Few people know how to engage oth-
ers with actionable next steps to gain leverage.
By means of “build, measure, learn,” you already know that frequent market 
testing is required in order to get feedback about your products and services 
so you can incrementally improve them. You can use interactions with the real 
world for the same purpose. Instead of giving visitors a feature-laden lecture, 
why not engage them in a fun experiment that helps your startup collect data 
about its product or service? Why not ask them questions to learn more 
about their opinions and interests? It is often possible to turn the situation 
around and derive a constructive learning session from engagements that at 
first seem dull and boring.
Know What You Want
You have gained clarity about your startup, your process, some of your first 
MVPs, and other insights. Now you have a good picture of who to engage for 
the cause of your startup. In the world of the startup entrepreneur, everybody 
becomes a potential MVP tester, client, partner, or advisor. Is someone telling 
you about their children at a networking event? If your startup works on an 
electric scooter, ask them to bring the kids to the lab to test how it feels to 
be the underage copilot. Are you programming software for traffic flow, and 
someone mentions that they know an operator at the transport authority? 
Ask them to set up a meeting so you can MVP test your prototype. Even 
if your MVP is still under construction when you set the meeting, whip up 
something overnight. Has a bank announced a visit to show high-net-worth 
individuals (HNWIs) around the campus? Design a questionnaire for them 
relating to your project, and make sure you’re the center of attention dur-
ing the visit. Does a government agency want to see in action some of your 
university’s technology that holds promise for the future? Engage them in the 
discussion, and get as much feedback as you can. Don’t resort to simply giving 
them the old shtick of your academic, top-down presentation, leaving them 
with nothing to act on after the visit. Engage them wherever you can. Collect

their business cards, ask for referrals to other agencies, and ask for one-on-
one sessions to gain a better understanding of their problems. You will learn 
invaluable lessons this way.
All this may sound grossly opportunistic and slightly crazy. It is not, when you 
begin thinking like a startup entrepreneur who has to make do with whatever 
presents itself. You will learn that you can be quite aggressive with your ideas 
and questions before anyone turns you down. As a startup entrepreneur, the 
world is your MVP testing lab.
The One-Page Proposal
A more formal approach to engaging people with actionable next steps is the 
one-page proposal, as described by author Patrick Riley.1 It spells out a target 
or goal, background information about your request, financial details, status quo, 
and next actions. Thinking in terms of one-page proposals is a helpful exercise 
to approach business with others. If you know exactly what you want, you can 
test how serious the other party is about collaborating with you. It is in your 
interest as an entrepreneur to find those who can help you get your venture 
off the ground and avoid wasting time with those who cannot or will not.
Here are the individual elements of the one-page proposal:
Title
• 
Target
• 
Secondary targets
• 
Rationale (the pitch)
• 
Financial
• 
Status
• 
Action
• 
Name and date
• 
Let’s go through each of them, one by one.
Title
Obviously, this is what your proposal is about. Make sure the title fits on one 
line. Make it bold, a few points bigger than the other type. “Proposal of XYZ 
for [ company ] to investigate potential for joint venture” is a workable title.

(New York: HarperBusiness, 2002).

Chapter 4 | Engaging Others with Actionable Next Steps
58
Target
The target is what you want—the outcome of what you propose. For exam-
ple, “Merging synergies with XYZ, complementing product line Z, establishing 
cost leadership in market X”.
Secondary Targets
These are other effects of the outcome you propose: increasing market share 
over competitors, a first-of-its-kind project or product, opening the door to a 
new customer group, and so on. List three secondary targets in bullet form.
Rationale
This section is slightly longer—one or two paragraphs. It outlines your back-
ground, some history, how you got started, what you are seeking to do, and 
some biographical information about the founders and their expertise.
Financial
If you ask for money, or if any other cost is involved (for example, to put on 
a special event or conference), list what you need. You can also break down 
the cost of components or anything else that may be relevant to finances in 
the proposal.
Status
Describe the project’s status quo. For instance, “The concept phase of project 
X is complete, and the project is ready to go. Prototype X is 80% complete 
and expected to be ready for testing next week”.
Action
This is the call to action to the other party. For example, “For company XYZ 
to internally discuss possibilities of a joint venture, then to schedule a follow-
up meeting for clarification and questions about the road ahead.”
Name and Date
Print the proposal, and sign and date it at the bottom. This is important and 
introduces some urgency. All your contact data, including e-mail and phone 
numbers, goes in the footer of the page.

An Example Proposal
This may all sound abstract. To clarify, Figure 4-1 shows a sample proposal by 
a fictitious research startup for a joint venture.
Figure 4-1.  Sample of a one-page proposal
In general, proposals are more convincing when you deliver them in person 
instead of via e-mail. Make an appointment, and say that you would like to 
schedule a meeting to talk about a proposal for a project. Then go to the 
appointment and take the printed proposal with you, neatly stored in a clear 
folder. If the recipient insists that you send it, or if they are located in another

country, still steer clear of sending a pdf via e-mail. Print it on good paper 
stock, sign it, and send it to the company via FedEx, addressed to the office of 
the CEO. This is too significant to be sitting in an e-mail inbox, next to unim-
portant spam. Make your proposals special.
It may look short and simple, but such a document can take a week to com-
plete. Remember that this is a one-pager, not a one-and-a-half pager. Keep 
it to one page not only because it is more accessible and elegant, but also 
because it forces you to strip all the bulk from your presentation and express 
it concisely. The font size should be at least 10 or 11, and the page should not 
look cramped.
Getting used to asking directly what you want takes a little while.  At first sight 
it often seems too straightforward, especially to those in academia, where 
interactions are informal but hesitant. In business, people appreciate your get-
ting to the point and putting your cards on the table. Working with written, 
actionable proposals shows that you are sincere in your undertaking. Even 
when you meet potential partners informally, you will sharpen your thinking 
toward engaging them in your process, rather than just providing entertain-
ment or a good show in the lab.
Prepare a few proposals for mundane things, as practice. Perhaps even write 
one for the managing director of the university where you conduct your 
research, proposing certain actions to help you with your startup. Get into the 
habit of presenting the proposal, and learn as you go.
To begin engaging others with actionable next steps, use the checklist in

Benefits vs. 
Features
A venture capitalist has read about your technology and has shown interest 
in learning more about your startup. When he and his associate come to the 
lab, you show them the research you have carried out in the last year. With 
your 200-slide strong PowerPoint presentation, you explain the features of 
the different technologies. This includes how you have improved on them by 
doing X, Y, and Z; an extensive list of software you used; and why most of it is 
no good to measure data with the precision you need. You show the statistical 
data that proves with confidence that this and that ratio have changed. Data 
from other tests is still waiting for processing, but once it is available, you can 
work on improving this and that ratio by so and so many percent. The venture 
capitalist and his associate both nod and say they find your work very interest-
ing. They promise to stay in touch, and they leave. Since that day, you have not 
heard from them, and your e-mails to them remain unanswered.
Such an interaction is most frustrating. Yet it is clear why it happens: research-
ers are by nature deeply involved in a topic. They are experts in the fea-
tures of a technology, how they interact, and how they have improved. On the 
other hand, consumers only care about the benefits of a technology. As Peter 
Drucker says, you don’t buy a product, but what that product does for you. 
This thinking is relatively alien to scientists, yet it is vital when making the jump 
into the free market. It no longer works to just present a technology and then 
let the other party figure out how to draw a benefit from it, let alone create 
a product. Academic entrepreneurs must make this step clear when speaking 
with non-academics.

Chapter 5 | Benefits vs. Features

The SPIN Technique
Author Neil Rackham devised a simple process called SPIN to move the dis-
cussion from features toward benefits.1 SPIN is an acronym for
Situation
• 
Problem
• 
Implication
• 
Need-payoff
• 
With this in mind, you can shift the discussion with external parties from a 
feature-laden presentation to an actual dialogue, where you match the ben-
efits of a technology with the needs of the other party.
To do this, let’s recap the fictitious example from the Lean Startup method: 
Simon has been building an electric scooter and now wants to take it to mar-
ket with a startup. He is trying to confirm the growth hypothesis (will people 
buy the product?). His scooter costs around $2,000, which is above the price 
of similar models on the market. Features of the scooter include a futuris-
tic design with several innovations (mainly the technology of the wheels), 
a closed body, new accelerator technology, and regenerative braking. Let’s 
see how Simon could conduct an interview to discover whether the market 
would buy this product. He has identified a potential buyer and asks her a few 
questions.
Simon: Hi, and thanks for coming to this interview. This here is our scooter. It 
has a cool design with numerous innovations. The wheels are 15% lighter than 
comparable wheels. The same goes for the closed body. Because it consists 
of carbon fiber, the scooter has the identical weight of other scooters with 
an open body in the mid range. Crash tests have shown that our closed body 
reduces driver injuries by at least 50% when a car hits you full frontal. The 
accelerator is also a novelty. We managed to optimize the air/fuel mix with a 
special jet that we patented. The technology is very exciting; I can show you 
how it works in more detail if you want. The scooter also has regenerative 
braking, which extends the battery charge by 9.5%.
Potential buyer: OK.
Simon: Would you buy it?
Potential buyer: Well, what does it cost?
Simon: About $2,000.

Potential buyer: Wow, that is beyond my price range. But it sure looks inter-
esting. Well, thanks for showing it to me. Keep up the good work. All the best 
with your project!
Did Simon learn anything about the market in this interview? No—nothing 
at all. He only concluded that the potential buyer will not buy the scooter. 
Was his growth hypothesis validated? No, because the buyer said the scooter 
was too expensive for her. This may be the case, but this answer had a lot to 
do with how Simon bombarded her with the features of the scooter. Buyers 
never think in features but in benefits, and the only one that Simon mentioned 
(50% fewer injuries in a full-frontal crash) hardly registered with the buyer. 
This interview was a complete waste of time, largely because Simon neglected 
to ask the potential buyer about her real needs. Let’s rewind and see what 
Simon could have done better.
Simon: Hi, and thanks for coming to this interview. Please tell me how you 
currently commute to work.
Potential buyer: I mainly take a bicycle.
Simon: OK. Every day, even when it rains?
Potential buyer: No, if it rains I take the MRT (a rapid commuter train in 
Singapore).
Simon: How does taking the MRT compare with the bicycle for you?
Potential buyer: The MRT is a drag. I live quite far from the station, and my 
office is also a 15-minute walk away from the next stop. This takes me about 
three times as long as taking the bicycle.
Simon: Have you tried wearing a raincoat on the bicycle when it rains? Or 
have you tried any other way to still be able to use the bicycle?
Potential buyer: Of course, I have tried everything! The thing is, I usually have 
my son with me, who sits in front in a child seat. I have to drop him off at 
kindergarten on the way and get him on the way home. When it rains, this is 
very cumbersome, and it is easier if we take the MRT.
Simon: OK, I see. So how often a week do you have to take the MRT then?
Potential buyer: About once or twice.
Simon: And how much time do you lose?
Potential buyer: About an hour per day. But it’s not only that. If there is no 
rain in the morning, I take the bicycle. But when the rain starts in the evening 
on my way back home, I am soaked, and so is the work I take home, and my 
child. The weather has become unpredictable lately. I have considered taking 
the MRT each day, but that would cost me 5 hours per week in commuting 
time, 20 hours per month. What a waste!

Chapter 5 | Benefits vs. Features
64
Simon: What about a car?
Potential buyer: No way. I can’t be seen in a vehicle that destroys the planet.
Simon: I meant an electric car.
Potential buyer: Yes, but those things don’t work reliably yet. And they are ugly. 
And they cost a fortune.
Simon: Would you consider a different vehicle, perhaps a scooter or electric 
bicycle that had an enclosure to shield against the rain?
Potential buyer: I never thought about that … Yes, that may be an alternative. 
But what about reliability and cost?
Simon: We’re working on a scooter that is very reliable and not that expen-
sive. There are two seats, and it has an enclosed body. This would protect you 
and your son from the rain and is very safe.
Potential buyer: Interesting … What does it cost?
Simon: About $2,000.
Potential buyer. Wow, that is beyond my price range.
Simon: Yes, it’s not cheap. But before, you said you would be wasting 20 hours 
per month by taking the MRT. That is 240 hours per year. If your time is worth 
at least $8 per hour, the scooter pays for itself in one year.
Potential buyer: When you look at it this way, you’re right. Can I take a test 
drive?
Do you see how this works? Simon fully engaged the potential buyer. He let 
her talk about the situation and frame the problem. Then he let her discover 
that she should do something to address that problem. Finally,  Simon brought 
up the scooter as a natural solution. In the previous example, when Simon 
told the potential buyer about all the features—regenerative braking, inno-
vative design, and the accelerator—he left her to figure out the benefit for 
herself. When he used SPIN, the benefit became obvious. The herself buyer 
gave all the arguments that the scooter could indeed be a solution. Without 
any sleaze or hard sell, Simon presented the scooter as the answer to her 
problem. Unless the buyer strongly dislikes the test drive, chances are high 
Simon sold his first unit.
Let’s analyze the interview in more detail:
The potential buyer’s 
• 
situation and problem is that she can-
not use her preferred mode of transport when it rains.
The 
• 
implication is that she is losing time because she has 
to use the MRT. If she let’s this slide, she keeps on wasting 
20 hours each month on commuting.

University Startups and Spin-Offs
65
The 
• 
payoff of Simon’s solution is that she can save time 
while still keeping her carbon footprint low and her 
finances intact.
Her actual need is not regenerative braking and fancy design, but a safe and 
reliable way to transport herself and her child around the city in any weather. 
These are benefits of the scooter, not features.
Simon was also smart to frame the discussion about the price in a different 
light. Because the potential buyer will make more than $8 per hour at her 
job, in just one year the scooter will have paid for itself because it saves over 
240 hours annually. This is a solid benefit, and it seems that this buyer may 
confirm the growth hypothesis. The only thing that changed was how Simon 
approached the interview, and it made all the difference.
These answers gave Simon a good picture of how this particular buyer thinks 
and what is important to her. In any event, he has learned a lot in this inter-
view. He can use the feedback he collected from this potential buyer in the 
next interview, and he can come up with a product that matches the needs 
of his market.
Listen and Learn
When you shape discussions with the SPIN mindset, people will tell you about 
their needs. You will learn whether your product meets them. If it does, great. 
If not, then you can adjust the product or find a different market. Had Simon 
asked the potential buyer directly about her needs, she might have given him a 
different answer than what he found out. Most people are unclear about what 
they want, so asking them directly rarely gives you the correct answers. It’s 
better to read between the lines and find out for yourself. Then test whether 
your findings are correct.
Once you have framed the discussion around the value that your product can 
bring to clients, then all you need to do is show your ability to deliver that 
value. If they trust that you are competent, they will want to make a deal. The 
last step is simply getting the commitment to move forward from the other 
party. That’s the whole secret of making a sale.
Validating the growth hypothesis is similar to making a sale. Unless you have 
clearly established the benefits of the product, trying to show your compe-
tency will fall on deaf ears. Unless people see you as competent, they will 
never buy. This is the difference between validating the hypothesis and not 
doing so. There is nothing more annoying than a salesman who drones on 
about their product or company, while the client is oblivious. Getting commit-
ment is impossible if the other party has no need for the benefit of your prod-
uct. If that’s the case, why should they make a deal with you? But it is perfectly 

Chapter 5 | Benefits vs. Features
66
possible that you can help a client to discover his need to address a lingering 
problem. This is where SPIN comes in to guide you.  Practice to break your 
communications into several steps. It gives you a proper framework to vali-
date your growth hypotheses and sell your products or services.
Make it a habit to think in terms of benefits in your startup. When engaging 
in discussion with others, begin by asking questions about their situations, 
their problems, and the implications of these problems, and then think of how 
your technology could help. This is an effective strategy to frame the dialogue 
around benefits, away from academic facts and technology features.
When you leave the building and engage with others while testing your MVPs, 
you will find that you can gain much insight from listening and watching. If you 
guide the discussion toward needs and benefits, as shown in the interview and 
outlined in Figure 5-1, people will voluntarily tell you the best reasons why 
your product is valuable. It is then just a matter of keeping the dialogue going 
and taking notes. Practice asking questions rather than beaming down infor-
mation. Practice listening and collecting feedback about your business model, 
financial model, product, or any other ideas.
Turn the features of a product or technology into benefits.

Simple 
Strategies to Get 
Unstuck
Jumping off the cliff into the unknown murky waters of entrepreneurship 
can be frightening. You have exposed yourself by proposing a bold idea and 
offered yourself up to criticism from those who follow a more conventional 
path. Because you have no successful entrepreneurs in your circle of friends 
who could guide you, it is your responsibility to master each challenge on 
your own. What do you do when your product is too expensive for the 
market, but you already stripped it down to the bare minimum? How should 
you react when a joint-venture partner calls with an offer that is too good to 
refuse but will take your company on a new, unfamiliar path?
Because it is impossible to have a detailed manual for every challenge, it is bet-
ter for entrepreneurs to learn a few strategies that help them tackle a wide 
array of situations. With those in your toolkit, you will be ready to master 
situations on your own. You should always be able to come up with several 
solutions to a challenge by yourself. When you rely on outside counsel to 
solve problems for you too often, you need to step up your game. It’s better 
to ask others what they think about your own ideas and hear their feedback 
than expecting them to do the work for you.
This chapter presents a few simple strategies that can help startups get an 
extra boost when they are stuck. These approaches are split into two main 
categories: those that help you take action and those that help you think.

They build on each other. You may already be familiar with some of them;  
others may sound new. As always, see which ones you find useful, not only to 
get unstuck, but to achieve better results in your startup in general.
Strategies to Take Action
Another analysis, another SWOT, another research paper, another workshop, 
or another brainstorming session will rarely help you get your startup off 
the ground. Usually, what is lacking is taking action. Have you tested your 
prototype in the market yet? Do you believe you need funding before you do 
so? And how will you get funding—by writing a clever grant proposal? The 
current practice of entrepreneurship at universities centers on analysis: think-
ing about fictitious products and how the market may or may not respond 
to them. The most important step of carrying out ambitious visions is miss-
ing in the curriculum. As a result, most students and researchers experience 
entrepreneurship in a bubble. There is no shortage of innovation policy that 
mandates the government should do this and that, and that universities should 
hold workshops and programs to promote more startup activity. In such a 
cocoon, entrepreneurs feel little pressure to make things happen for them-
selves. University entrepreneurship is in many ways still a theoretical exercise 
and much less a practical one. This is a pity, because it makes it OK for start-
ups to spend time writing proposals and brainstorming instead of leaving the 
building and collecting accurate market intelligence about their assumptions.
As long as this continues, university startups will not be in the game. And not 
being in the game is worse than not being good enough. When I propose to 
software startup teams that they create a mockup frontend for their nonex-
istent software as the first order of business, they often discount this as “BS.” 
They think they first need to complete the full backend programming over 
several months. Yet who knows if what they are coding will hit a nerve in the 
market? If it does, who knows if there will be enough clients who will buy the 
product? They can only find out by testing their hypotheses. If the product is 
software and there is no backend yet, you can create a faux user experience 
in a mockup program and fake the backend. This is the only way to get timely 
feedback on ideas.
As expected, such suggestions raise eyebrows at university startups. They 
go against everything a self-respecting scientist stands for. Scientific research 
by nature goes deep into an issue, and releasing half-baked ideas can have 
dire consequences. When results of academic research stand ready to be 
published, panels of experts review them and either approve or reject them. 
If a publication is turned down, then it is back to the drawing board. More 
research is carried out, and the paper is resubmitted. In startup land, it is quite 
the opposite. You had an idea this morning in the shower. By lunch, you have 
mocked up a minimum viable product (MVP) that you test with real potential

clients in the afternoon. Come suppertime, you know whether your idea has 
legs. MVPs are shallow, buggy, unfinished, and have very little to do with your 
final product. But if the market gives signals that it would like to see more and 
is ready to pay for it, then you can tinker with the product and test it again 
until it reaches the stage where you believe it can launch.
Imagine an iceberg with a small visible tip above the waterline and a huge 
invisible part in the water (see Figure 6-1). The researcher first builds the 
huge invisible part. This symbolizes the research and data collected over many 
years, sometimes decades. If researchers decide to launch a startup, they build 
the small visible part on top of the large block of ice at the very end of the 
process. This small visible part represents the product that sells in the market. 
Startup entrepreneurs approach the issue from the other side. First they cre-
ate the visible part and make it look as if there is a huge invisible part in the 
water. Only when the market flocks to the imaginary iceberg does the entre-
preneur build out the entire block of ice under the water.
Figure 6-1.  Difference in business approach between researchers (left) and entrepreneurs 
(right)
Scientists think that their product is the logical extension of all the research 
they have undertaken so far. This would be the ideal case, but they may have to 
adjust their expectations about what the market wants. They will have to tweak 
their product or come up with a different one. When the market speaks, all 
meticulous planning goes out the window. It is only through taking action that 
this process begins. How can entrepreneurs force themselves to take more 
action? Following are some strategies that have worked well for my startups.
One Action per Day
Avoid getting caught up in analysis paralysis. Most likely, you do not need more 
information, you need more action. Make it a point to take one action each 
day that moves your startup forward. Is it picking up the phone and setting 
up a lunch meeting with that potential industry partner you recently met at 
a networking event? Or is it finishing the one missing part of the MVP to test 
with a group of prospects? Draw up a list of such actions, and then spread 
them over the week. Pick one per day, and by the end of the week you will 
have completed seven. Instead of actions, you can also write down goals; this 
is entirely up to you.

Chapter 6 | Simple Strategies to Get Unstuck
70
Forcing yourself to take one action each day helps to take your mind off  
analysis and shift it into action. Avoid overloading yourself with tasks on one 
day. Spread them evenly over a longer period of time. When you have com-
pleted your daily tasks, resist the temptation to add more tasks to your list 
for the day. Instead, reward yourself for following through. Over time, you will 
form a habit of continually moving your projects forward in frequent small 
steps. This is much more helpful than only focusing on giant leaps, which are 
notoriously difficult to complete.
The Deadline Is Your Friend
Set deadlines for specific tasks, and publicly announce them. Set up interviews 
for your MVP tests before you have finished your MVPs. Promise to deliver 
reports by the end of the week that do not exist yet. Such commitments 
force you toward action. More often than not, you will finish your deliverables 
in a short time under such pressure. Parkinson’s Law puts this empirical find-
ing in words: “Work expands to fill the time available for completion” (see 
Figure 6-2).1 Author Northcote Parkinson studied how the increasing num-
ber of civil servants stands in relation to their workload.  We would expect 
the government to hire more staff to deal with its increasing workload. This 
increases the time public servants have available to complete their tasks, so 
they should get more done in a given amount of time. But the opposite is the 
case: when they have more staff and therefore more time available, it takes 
government employees far longer to complete their work.2

I often work with timers and alarm clocks. A specific task—for example,  
writing a report about the meetings that took place during the month—gets 
90 minutes. I cannot go over time, but I also cannot do anything else during 
these 90 minutes. Author Roy Baumeister calls this the Nothing Alternative.3 
The strategy is powerful to focus your attention on one thing and one thing 
only. Looking at the timer counting down is a compelling reminder to com-
plete the task instead of letting it drag on. Try it the next time you are writing 
a report. The traditional way, this can take several days. With the Nothing 
Alternative, you will surprise yourself when you complete the report in a few 
hours, or perhaps even in 45 minutes.
Once I asked a contractor when I could expect the finished product from him. 
“It is finished when it is finished,” he replied. Obviously, this guy had no clue 
how to speed up his work. Parkinson’s Law allowed the task to mushroom 
because he had set no deadline. This was greatly to his disadvantage because he 
was paid a fixed fee for his work, regardless of whether he completed it today 
or in a month. If you are a startup entrepreneur, this approach is not for you. 
Set clear deadlines, make them short, make them public, and stick to them.
Mastermind Groups
Sitting in your office or lab, surrounded by sceptics of free markets or those 
who have firmly subscribed to the security of 9-5 employment, will hardly 
stimulate you to make moves as an entrepreneur. Frequent contact with other 
entrepreneurs who are in the same boat as you can encourage you to get 
off your chair. Get their advice and feedback about how they tackle certain 
issues. See the way they are doing things, and copy it. Get together and discuss 
the specific actions you have taken this week and where they led your team. 
Discuss your successes and mishaps, and learn how others address the same 
challenges.
Going at it alone is much more difficult than approaching entrepreneurship 
in a group of like-minded individuals. They can inspire a healthy competition 
where they will call you out if you keep deliberating instead of testing in the 
market. Ensure that you have action-oriented people around you. A good net-
work can have a major impact, not only on shifting your focus toward taking 
action, but in all stages of entrepreneurship.
Author Napoleon Hill created Mastermind Groups over 75 years ago.4 How 
do masterminds work? A group of like-minded people meet regularly to 
talk about specific challenges. They provide advice, share connections, and

­collaborate when appropriate. This practice is comparable to peer-to-peer 
mentoring. Mastermind groups are often invite-only. If no group exists in your 
environment, simply set up your own. Invite other startup entrepreneurs from 
your university to your new mastermind. Connect with entrepreneurs on 
the Internet or LinkedIn. Contact industry interest groups and ask them to 
introduce established businesspeople to you. It is essential that all members of 
the group are on the same wavelength. Do not include people who have only 
theoretical knowledge or no experience. Treat your mastermind group as an 
exclusive club. Not only will you add powerful contacts to your network, but 
the opportunities to learn firsthand from others and get in the habit of think-
ing big are worth the effort.
Strategies to Think
Despite what you just learned about taking action, there are of course many 
occasions that require you to plan and analyze the facts before jumping in. I 
have said that writing a business plan is unnecessary when you are running 
your startup lean. But this does not imply that you should never write down 
a word about how you plan for your business to unfold. The analysis part is 
important, but it should never overtake and dominate the action part. If you 
remember that, then the following strategies will help you tackle certain chal-
lenges in your startup from a fresh angle.
Mind Storming: The Twenty Idea Method
Author Earl Nightingale originally put forward the Twenty Idea Method.5 In a 
somewhat spiritual context, he noted that when a person engages in “mind 
storming,” the person’s consciousness expands and taps into ideas that were 
previously out of reach. In essence, the Twenty Idea Method comes down to 
putting together a list of possible solutions to a challenge you are struggling 
with. However, instead of just writing down 3 or 4 ideas, you force yourself 
to find 20 ideas in a short amount of time. The final few are often those that 
yield surprising insight. Repeating this practice each day for a week will help 
you come up with astounding solutions to problems that are unavailable if you 
simply try to deal with them rationally. I find this method excellent for coming 
up with unconventional ideas. If your entire team brainstorms together, you 
will have an efficient process to look at problems in a new light. How does it 
work? Let’s look at a basic example.

1986).

Let’s say you are struggling with your business model. You have a patent that 
you could let the technology licensing office (TLO) deal with on your behalf, 
but you want to start your own company with your intellectual property. As a 
business, should you sell a service, a product, or a license to manufacture the 
product? What are possible applications of the IP? This is a classic case for 
mind storming. Take out a blank piece of paper. Use pen and paper instead of 
a laptop, tablet, or phone—the process of writing down the 20 solutions has 
to be fast, so writing by hand is best. Something magical happens if you write 
with a pen on paper. Fiddling with a keyboard will only interfere. At the top 
of the piece of paper, write down the problem. In your case, this is: “What is a 
good business model for company X?” On the left side of the page, write the 
numbers 1 to 20. If there is not enough space, halve the page with a vertical 
line and split the numbers into two columns of 10. All the ideas should be on 
one page so you can always see them during the mind-storming process.
The trick is to rush yourself through this exercise. Take no more than 5 min-
utes to complete all 20 solutions. Set up a timer for this purpose. You begin 
with solution 1, which will be the most obvious one that comes to mind first. 
Perhaps you discussed this idea repeatedly with your co-founders, so it is 
nothing new. Regardless, write it down. Then advance to number 2. Same here. 
Number 3. And so on. Around number 10, the obvious ideas will run out. This 
is where the magic begins to happen. Whatever comes to mind from here on, 
write it down quickly. Some ideas may seem silly, but this is OK. Keep going 
until you have come up with 20 ideas. Then review them, and choose the three 
that you like best. They may be hybrid ideas, cobbled together from several 
different ideas. Elaborate further on those three, and find out in more detail 
whether they are feasible and how they apply to your startup situation.
Mind storming can be on your daily agenda for a while. You will be surprised 
by the strange ideas you and your team can produce. It can help to involve an 
outsider without domain knowledge when mind storming. Outsiders often 
see a problem from a completely different angle and may bring an unexpected 
viewpoint to your process.
Think on Paper
Never begin the day until you have finished it on paper, wrote business phi-
losopher Jim Rohn. In a seminar on business strategy in the 21st century, he 
detailed his suggested practice of making several lists to guide you through 
the day, the week, the month, and the entire year.6 After all, a successful week 
consists of successful days, a successful month of successful weeks, and a suc-
cessful year of successful months. If you have a written outline of what you

wish to achieve each day, you will have a higher chance of staying on course. 
There is far less danger of losing focus when unexpected distractions come 
up. You do not have to go to extremes and obey your day planner without 
any autonomous thinking or spontaneity. However, writing your thoughts and 
tasks on to-do lists is a good idea.
In addition to doing daily planning, make other short lists for everything that 
is important. Writing it down clears your mind and frees up brain power for 
other tasks. If you call someone about business, make a brief outline of what 
you would like to talk about and what the next steps are. If you go to a meet-
ing, make a list of the items you want solved and how they will be addressed 
with the next steps. You can discard these lists immediately after you have 
completed them. They simply serve the purpose of organizing and structuring 
your ideas before you discuss them with other people.
I often make a list in the evening on which I write down things to do the 
next day. I also have a weekly list with three larger goals or milestones for 
the week. If there are still items on the daily to-do list in the evening, I make 
a concerted effort to complete them or move them to the next day. This is 
OK as long as it still allows reaching the three weekly milestones. Another list 
I have is the not-to-do list.7 These are actions to avoid, mostly time wasters 
and distractions. This list is a great reminder to put up next to your computer. 
Experiment with what works well for you. There is no one-size-fits-all recipe 
for thinking on paper.
Mind Maps
You have probably heard of mind maps, popularized by author Tony Buzan.8 
You may already be an avid mind mapper, or you may hardly use them at all. I 
find them helpful at times to summarize processes or books and bring them 
into a larger context. For brainstorming, however, I rarely use mind maps. For 
that purpose, I prefer the linear format of the Twenty Idea Method. Mind maps 
work better for me as a context tool. Figure 6-3 shows a mind map of the 
book The Innovator’s DNA.9

Everybody has their own mind-mapping technique. I organize mind maps 
of books by chapters. Each of the chapters contains other nodes that I can 
expand with a click. Such a summary can be intuitive and straightforward for 
presenting the book’s highlights to others.
Mind mapping is not for everyone, though. Some people find it cumbersome 
and prefer to write summaries with bullet points. I use both, depending on 
my mood. Try it to see whether it works for you. Plenty of free software is 
available that allows you to experiment with mind mapping and determine 
its usefulness for you. You can of course also use old-fashioned paper, but I 
prefer software for mind mapping because it permits painless archiving and 
retrieval even years later. The digital format also makes it easy to share mind 
maps with others.
Just Ten More Minutes
This is not a strategy by itself; it is more an add-on to give you a quick boost. 
When you are exhausted and have about had it with a task or problem, make 
it a point to spend just ten more minutes on it before you wrap up. Set a timer 
or alarm, and then give it all you’ve got. This will focus your thinking and assure 
you that after ten minutes, you can let it go.
It is surprising what this approach can do for you. There are projects where 
close to 80% of my good ideas happened in these last ten minutes. Try it, and 
see if it works for you.

76
Limiting the time remaining can also motivate your team. For example, if you 
are at the end of a two-hour brainstorming session that has failed to produce 
any good results, instead of finishing up and rescheduling the entire session, 
just give it ten more minutes. If you buckle down, you may think of your best 
ideas right then and there.
Visualize
Most successful people I know visualize in one way or another. This simply 
means thinking in pictures. Successful golfers and tennis players do it. So do 
actors and singers, hedge-fund managers and CEOs. They see an action or 
event step by step many times in their mind and imagine the perfect execution 
and result. If Roger Federer uses visualization, why shouldn’t you?
Assume that tomorrow you will give an important presentation about your 
research startup to a government delegation. As the team lead, you will have 
the honor of introducing the project in a five-minute speech that explains 
how your technology is useful in infrastructure planning. For a week, you have 
chiseled your speech, memorized it, practiced it in front of the mirror, and 
annoyed your friends and family with its details. Now, on the eve of the criti-
cal day, you lie awake in bed and fret about all that could possibly go wrong. 
Should you have prepared differently? Should you rewrite the entire speech 
again? It will hardly do anything for you to say the speech out loud from mem-
ory one more time. There is also nobody left to give you further feedback on 
it. It is your responsibility now to make it work.
In a situation like this, visualization can instill great confidence and calm. Make 
sure nobody disturbs you for a while. Close your eyes, and imagine walking 
up to the podium. You tap the microphone, welcome the audience, and give 
a speech that would have made John F. Kennedy envious. There is a standing 
ovation at the end, and the government delegation commissions a large proj-
ect from your startup on the spot. You go celebrate with a magnum bottle 
of champagne, and then … The rest is for you to imagine. You see how this 
works: imagine the perfect outcome for about five minutes with great inten-
sity. If you are nervous right before the speech, briefly visualizing everything 
going perfectly can also help you calm down. It may feel silly the first few times, 
but visualization has helped countless successful people master sticky situa-
tions with bravado.
Many more productivity and time-management techniques exist in the lit-
erature. The ones outlined in this chapter are among those that I use daily. 
Of course, I am not proposing that you practice them compulsively in every  
situation. But when you are stuck, they may help get you and your team  
moving forward again.

Troubleshooting
Inevitably, there will be times when everything seems to go wrong in your 
startup. It is 2 am, your third MVP still pleases hardly anyone, and you ran out 
of ideas a long time ago. Troubles are brewing on your team: they doubt your 
abilities as the CEO and think they should get real jobs and forget about this 
crazy entrepreneurship idea. The university is breathing down your neck to 
vacate its premises, and your personal bankroll is reduced to triple digits. 
The joint venture you aimed for has fallen through, while a competitor from 
another university has gotten exactly the terms you wanted with the company 
you targeted.
There are low points on every entrepreneur’s journey—you cannot escape 
them. What matters most is the way you deal with them. Bumps in the road 
can always occur, but no problem is too large to straighten out.
Wherever there is trouble, growth is just around the corner. “Calm you shall 
keep and carry on you must,” as Grand Master Yoda reminds us. The problems 
I just mentioned are not all that grave. Nobody has been seriously wounded 
by your product. Everyone is still alive. Stressed and grumpy, but alive.
Whenever there are conflicts, you should write them down on paper, so you 
get them out of your head. Never to go to bed before writing down your 
problems. Once they are on paper, you can organize them by importance and 
cross out the ones that are less significant. Solutions may arise as soon as you 
begin writing.
At your wit’s end with the MVP? Look at your results. Make it a priority for 
the entire team to do nothing else until you have found a solid, testable case. 
Hold brainstorming sessions. Ask others for advice—even your competitors. 
Going for a walk or playing sports can help take your mind off an issue. An 
extended bike ride can generate many ideas. Give yourself a few hours to let 
your subconscious do the job for you.

The team lost faith in you? Get them together in a meeting and discuss the 
matter. What could you do better? What could they do better? Do they 
want to exit the startup? Perhaps you can find a compromise where everybody 
stays on board until a certain date and decides then. Until that date, every-
body does their best to make the company work. Compromises are much 
better than a potential calamity that could break loose any second. It is 
simply a matter of addressing the issue and dealing with it like adults. In a 
quiet moment, ask yourself: What is the worst case that could happen in 
this situation? Imagine what that would mean for you, and begin living with 
the idea that it may become reality. Once you accept the worst possible 
outcome, you will no longer unreasonably defend a losing position. You will 
think much more clearly when attacking the problem head on.
What if the university keeps asking when you will get your own office? Make 
a deal with the university, and promise to deliver X until a specified date rolls 
around. Perhaps you can rally other stakeholders in the university who will let 
you use another, smaller office on a more permanent basis.
Money is running low? Bootstrap. Make Top Ramen the cornerstone of your 
diet. One way to have more money is to spend less. Otherwise, find a part-time 
job to restock your war chest.
Joint venture plans fell apart? Look for other candidates. When something 
fails, it may turn out to be a blessing down the road. Keep an open mind, and 
actively find new opportunities.
As an entrepreneur, you are a maverick who cannot please everybody. It may 
sound harsh, but you need to surround yourself with people who are on the 
same wavelength. You need a good, encouraging network and other entre-
preneurs around you to keep you going. When a maverick made his or her 
mark, everyone is proud. Unless you ruffle a few feathers, it will be hard to 
find a way out of the mainstream and achieve success on your own terms.
Prioritize
When issues arise in your startup, avoid letting them linger. Step forward and 
address them. Open communication is key here, but refuse to hold yourself up 
with minor issues. Address the most important problems first, and some of the 
smaller ones may turn out to be less urgent. With “build, measure, learn,” you 
have a powerful toolkit that teaches constant incremental improvement. Use 
this for your MVP and also for your general skills as a startup entrepreneur.  
If an idea fails to work, try something else. Keep moving constantly.

In general, thinking on paper is a great ally for problem-solving. You may make 
an old-fashioned list or draw a mind map to address certain issues. When 
you see problems laid out in front of you on paper, they become manage-
able. You can bring them into context with each other. You may brainstorm 
how to address them or what will happen if you let them linger. Get into the 
habit of carrying pen and paper around with you. This is valuable not only for 
problem-solving, but for all other facets of entrepreneurship as well.
An Outsider’s View
Sometimes it can be useful to enlist outside help. If your startup is only two 
weeks old and you already find yourself at the brink of disaster, then there may 
be matters that need more thorough investigation. A startup coach may help 
you solve them. When all else fails, you have the option of hiring a so-called 
interim CEO to see the startup through a rough patch. This may be worth 
considering and in the long-term interest of the university’s startup track, 
especially when the stakes are high and a breakthrough or joint venture is 
just around the corner. Many well-known businesses were at some point on 
the brink of bankruptcy. An executive change often helped declutter their 
business model and bring them back onto the path to profitability. When 
things get hairy, that is where entrepreneurial experience comes in. You can-
not learn this by reading a book—only from living entrepreneurship firsthand 
for years, through its ups and downs.
Throughout this book, you have repeatedly read my recommendation to tap 
into the experience of an established entrepreneur to assist university startup 
teams. This can be an alumnus of the university who has achieved great busi-
ness success. Instead of hiring an alum to make a keynote speech, the univer-
sity could ask him or her to work with their startups as an advisor. This can 
also be a person in a related field whom the team has identified as some-
one they would like to have on their board to offer ideas and criticism. The 
university cannot reasonably expect a startup team made up of students or 
researchers to learn the ropes of entrepreneurship overnight. Of course, they 
should know some management basics when they run their own company, but 
navigating real problems successfully is a rare skill.
Access to an outsider’s opinion for a few hours, focused on a specific chal-
lenge that a startup is struggling with, can make all the difference. I have seen 
this firsthand several times. The startup team was at their wit’s end and ready 
to give up, but a few tweaks in their product and business model brought them 
back to their intended trajectory. The input that an established entrepreneur 
may give can seem trite in retrospect; it is often not sweeping changes but 
sticking to the basics that provides a startup with an extra boost. Subtracting 
something is frequently more powerful than adding more to the mix. When

the journey gets rough, the founding team is often too close to the problem 
to see what they should do. Together with an outsider, they can shed light on 
a challenge from a new angle and solve it in an unexpected way.
Whenever you experience headwinds with your startup, use the checklist in

The Financial 
Model
Although researchers are generally comfortable talking about their technology 
and its features at length, they are often much less well-versed in the business 
and financial aspects of their undertaking. Entrepreneurs need to be in a posi-
tion to answer a few key financial questions about their venture. What are we 
producing that has a value in the market? Will the market pay us enough to be 
profitable? How exactly are we transferring money from customers into our 
bank account? The business-model canvas answers the first question, but the 
other ones require a financial model made with spreadsheet software.
When you sit across the table from venture capitalists, they will grill you about 
your financial model. You should know the size of your potential market, your 
expected market share, how long you believe it will take you to sell a product 
in this market, and how you plan to turn your market share into profit for 
your company. If you cannot answer a few basic financial questions, no one will 
take you seriously as a startup entrepreneur.
That being said, there is one thing investors know with certainty about your 
financial model: the model will be wrong. Investors are well aware of that, so 
they want to see the assumptions that underlie your forecast, much more 
than the forecast itself. Putting together your financial model will give you an 
impression of the time it will take for your startup to achieve some level of 
profitability. You will also have worked out your own overhead and capital 
needs, often called the burn rate. All this is what investors look at, not the 
hockey-stick revenue-growth chart that all other startups have in their mod-
els as well. How you put together your financial model is more informative 
than the individual numbers.

Financial models and projections can be simple, but there are some pitfalls to 
avoid. I once made the mistake of proudly announcing that “If we sell widget 
X to 1% of the people in China for $1 each year, we will make $10 million 
in revenue.” The venture capitalist had of course heard this lame pitch many 
times before, and responded, “You expect just 1% market share? What kind 
of small-minded company is this? I only invest in companies with 80% market 
share.” With that, the discussion was over. A $10 million market seemed big 
for me at the time, but less so for anyone who has been in the business longer. 
A good market starts at about $100 million per year in sales revenue.
Basics of Financial Business Modeling
If you are already familiar with accounting and building financial models for 
startups, feel free to skip this chapter. If not, then here is a quick primer on 
the most important terms in a financial model. This is my personal approach, 
and I realize there are many different opinions about how to do it right. The 
procedure I explain in this chapter is one that I find workable without know-
ing much about corporate finance. It helps jumpstart the discussion about 
a startup’s finances without much spreadsheet programming. If you prefer 
another modeling technique, that’s fine. As long as you can explain what you 
are doing and why you are doing it, all roads lead to Rome.
The important terms in your financial model are revenue, cost, profit, and 
profit margin. Their formulas are as follows:
                 Revenue = number of units sold × price charged per unit
                 Cost = fixed cost + variable cost
                        = fixed cost + (number of units sold × cost per unit)
                 Profit = revenue - cost
Profit margin

Let’s look at each of these in a little more detail:
• 
Revenue means the total proceeds from sales. It is the 
money brought into the company by its business activi-
ties. You calculate this amount by multiplying the number 
of units sold by the price per unit. The term revenue is 
sometimes used interchangeably with sales, and the two 
mean the same thing. Many people confuse the revenue 
with profit. Even though your company may have $100 
million in revenue per year, its profit may still be zero or 
negative.

• 
Profit is the money left in your account after you pay 
all costs incurred by the company. When calculating 
profit in your spreadsheet, also make a clear distinc-
tion between pre-tax profit and after-tax profit. Because 
taxes are a percentage of profit, you simply multiply the 
corporate tax rate by the pre-tax profit. Startup entre-
preneurs often forget to make this distinction, but it can 
make a big difference, especially if your tax rate is high.
The percentage of revenue that you keep as profit is 
• 
called the profit margin. This number shows how profit-
able your company is. Because it is a ratio, you can use it 
to compare the profitability of different companies.
• 
Costs consist of fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs 
are the overhead of the company that stays the same 
regardless of the number of units sold. Rent paid for 
offices, support services, all salaries, and so on, are fixed 
costs. Variable costs change with the number of units 
sold. For example, if you are producing a car, then these 
include the metal, plastics, engine, tires, and so on. If you 
pay licensing fees for patents per car sold, then these fees 
are also part of the variable costs.
These are the most important terms. There are of course many more formu-
las in financial accounting, but these should be enough for a simple financial 
model for a startup. If you think accounting is exciting, then feel free to pick 
up any book on the subject to learn more.
It often takes entrepreneurs by surprise to hear that the most vital parts 
of their model are the costs and the assumptions that underlie the revenue 
projection. Revenue and profit projections in themselves are less important, 
because you cannot predict them accurately. Regardless, you should set up 
your business model so that your startup can achieve high revenues. If a com-
pany has high revenue, it can improve its profit by reducing fixed and variable 
costs, courtesy of economies of scale. Building 1 item results in a higher cost 
per item compared to producing 100 items. A bigger factory can often turn 
out a product at a lower cost than a small one.
When you begin building the financial model, first fill in the parts that you 
know already. These may be the fixed cost and variable cost per unit sold. You 
may have a validated assumption about the price charged per unit. With this, 
you already have half the model. The tricky part is the speculation about how 
many units you can sell each year. I discuss some guidelines for this later in 
this chapter.

How Investing in Startups Works
When investors give you money, they obviously expect something in return. 
Where does this return come from? Not from revenue, but from the profit 
your company makes in the future. With their money, investors buy a certain 
number of shares in your company. This number of shares, as a percentage of 
the total shares in the company, controls the percentage of profit each inves-
tor is entitled to receive.
Let’s say you can make the case that your company will turn a profit of  
$10 million in year 3, $11 million in year 4, and $12 million in year 5, as shown 
in Table 8-1. Before year 3, profit was negative. This projection enables you 
to make a ballpark assumption about the value of your company today. There 
are many ways to arrive at such a value, and to explain them all here would 
be outside the scope of this book. A straightforward procedure to arrive at 
a speculative number for the value of your company is to discount the pro-
jected future cash flows by their probability and sum them up, as follows:
   Company value = 1×(-$100,000)+1×(-$200,000)
                            + 0.5×$10,000,000+0.4×$11,000,000+0.3×$12,000,000
                         = $12,700,000

This is an example to illustrate how the numbers in your financial model work 
in context. Of course, it is an extreme simplification, and specialists in finance 
will cringe when they see me advocate this technique. Venture capitalists will 
look at your underlying assumptions and come up with a valuation of their 
own. As a quick hack, the probability method is workable without going back 
to school and learning about corporate finance. Most important, this number 
will put into perspective investment offers you may be receiving.
Let’s say you have arrived at the projections just outlined. The big jump in 
revenue in year 3 results from talks you had with a potential joint venture 
partner. He wrote you a letter of intent saying that if you can develop your 
technology to a certain point, he will be willing to form a joint venture with 
you. Because this partner is a leading multinational, you can expect better

­distribution channels, instant economies of scale, and larger projects. Your 
own costs will increase, but because your profit margin is high, you can rea-
sonably expect high profits. Now a venture capitalist visits your startup and 
offers you $250,000 for 10% of the company. Does this sound like a good 
deal? Let’s see: if 10% of your company cost $250,000, then 100% are worth 
$2,500,000. The numbers you calculated paint a different picture: your com-
pany value at the current time is $12,700,000, so 10% equals $1,270,000. 
Based on your own numbers, you should expect a much better offer from 
the venture capitalist. According to your calculation, she should get roughly  
2% equity in your company, not 10%, for her $250,000 investment.
With the assumptions gained in putting together your financial model, you 
can begin a negotiation without flying blind. The number you calculate as the 
present value for your company is either too high or too low. You need to 
check and update it often and get feedback from others about it. But now you 
see how your startup’s numbers work. They are not rocket science, but they 
also are not immediately obvious. An entrepreneur who has no clue about the 
value of his company will be taken advantage of by shrewd investors. Most of 
all, they will doubt he is genuine in his efforts if he comes across as financially 
illiterate. As soon as you can lead a qualified discussion about your financial 
model, investors will take you more seriously.
It is unnecessary to hire an MBA or a financial advisor to program the financial 
model for you. Much more important is that you understand the drivers and 
underlying assumptions of the model and what they mean for your business. 
You should be able to modify the model yourself.
A joint venture partner will often value your company differently than a ven-
ture capitalist—for example, in terms of costs the partner can save by buy-
ing your R&D, or in terms of the IP advantage gained over a competitor. 
Nevertheless, it is useful to have your own model at hand. Most likely you will 
need it only when you speak with investors or potential partners.
Identify Your Market
Previously I skipped the discussion of how to arrive at the number of units 
sold in your startup. Before I address this, you first need to understand the 
different kinds of markets. Author Steve Blank summarizes them in the fol-
lowing manner: 1
• 
Existing market: A new entrant is stealing a slice of a market. 
Users abandon competitor products when they start using 
yours. Instead of increasing the pie, you just take a slice.
1Steven G. Blank, The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products That Win 
(K&S Ranch, 2007).

Chapter 8 | The Financial Model
86
• 
Re-segmented market: You increase the pie by selling to 
customers who otherwise would not buy at all—for 
example, by introducing a less-expensive product that 
adds price-conscious customers to the market.
• 
New market: Your technology is new, and by definition 
you own 100% of the market. You must explain to the 
market what the product is and how to use it. Customers 
will still use other products when they start using yours.
The most important thing to show in your financial model is what Steve Blank 
calls Product/Market Fit.2 Netscape founder Marc Andreessen describes this as 
“being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.”3 Most 
companies are re-segmenting markets in one way or another. A rule of thumb 
for achieving Product/Market Fit is that at least 40% of users should say they 
would be “very disappointed” without your product.4
What does this mean for your financial model? Most important, you need 
to demonstrate that you can sell to at least 40% of the market. If yours is 
an existing market, then you can find out its size relatively easily courtesy of 
Google. Perhaps there is even a market study available. Or an academic paper 
or trade journal in your library. Or a footnote in the quarterly report of the 
industry leader.
Re-segmented markets are more complicated to assess, because you have to 
make some assumptions about the size of the slice you are adding. Calculate 
several scenarios, starting from 10% up to 50%. In either case, your projected 
annual revenue should land somewhere around $100 million and upward. As  
I said before, investors know that this number is mostly fiction, but it should 
be achievable with your startup if everything goes well.
Let’s forget about new markets for now, because they are rare and the most 
speculative to assess.
The number-one thing not to do is to conjure up hockey-stick growth, where 
in the first years you have no sales, and then, magically, in year 3 the business 
takes off like a rocket, doubling or tripling its income year after year. If you 
have real commitments, like the joint venture discussed in the example of 
company value, then your financial projections are much stronger, and you can 
explain the underlying assumptions for hockey-stick growth. But if you cannot, 
then the hockey stick will look silly. Future revenue projections are not all

that important. What counts is a strong business model that harvests demand 
today and in the next few years from existing markets. At the end of the day, 
everything else is fiction. Unless you have a classic business model, such as a 
real-estate investment with a large sunk cost of several hundred million and 
rental revenue over the next 20 years, projections into the future make little 
sense. For a tech or hardware startup in the early stages, they are little more 
than wishful thinking. Just show the size of the market, the share you aim to 
achieve eventually, and how your pricing strategy fits into that equation.
When you know the market size and your market share, then you have to fit 
that around your pricing model for your product or service. Many eye open-
ers along the way will show you either that you need to charge an enormous 
sum for your product or that your market is simply too small to allow you 
explosive growth. When that is the case, you can use this new insight in your 
future MVP testing. Look for other products and services, and other markets, 
and test those. Your costs may also be too high to let your startup achieve 
profitability, in which case you need to reduce them. The lean canvas and the 
financial model are like sparring partners that can help you do so.
The Story Matters More Than the Numbers
Every serious investor knows that financial projections for a startup are rarely 
going to come true, so you must prepare to answer questions about the 
underlying assumptions that led to your projections. Don’t get me wrong: you 
still need the financial model; it is an essential tool to help you form useful 
assumptions about your market, your business model, and your strategy. But it 
is key to be clear about the story that explains how the financial model came 
about. How did you discover the market your product is serving? How did 
you come up with the market share your company is aiming to achieve? Can 
you make a credible case about exactly how your company will turn a profit? 
How did you arrive at the timeline? All this information is more helpful for 
investors than an upward-sloping revenue curve. They will form their own 
opinion of you as an entrepreneur and combine that with their assumptions 
about the product and the market. If they see that you are smart and have 
come up with a good idea to commercialize a certain technology with profit, 
they will be more likely to invest in you. The financial model will be the plat-
form on which this discussion takes place.
Make sure the output of the model fits on one page, where you also explain 
all the underlying assumptions. With this and the lean canvas, you will have 
condensed your entire business proposition onto a few sheets of paper. When 
you meet with investors or potential partners, present your business with 
both the business-model canvas and the financial model. See what they gravi-
tate toward and what they remark. Then incorporate those new findings into 
the next version of your documents.

These are the basics you should be familiar with when building financial mod-
els. If you have heard enough about finance and economics, feel free to skip 
the rest of this chapter. Otherwise, read on to see how economic theory is 
not all that useful in startup entrepreneurship.
A Word about Economic Theory
As you already learned, becoming an expert in economics or corporate 
finance is unnecessary to create your financial model. More often than not, 
it may even be a disadvantage. It is good to know some basics of economics, 
because they are helpful for explaining things in hindsight. But when you are 
putting together your financial model, it is better to be blissfully ignorant. Let’s 
find out why.
The discipline of modern economics is a strange conglomeration of sociology, 
psychology, and philosophy. On the basic level, it splits into two main sections: 
microeconomics and macroeconomics. The former concerns itself with the 
theory of individual firms and addresses supply and demand for products, 
price theory, market structures, and so on. Macroeconomics applies itself to 
the workings of all companies together in an economy as a whole, and the 
interrelationships with other economies. How the size of a company affects 
its production costs is a matter of microeconomics, whereas the amount of 
money in circulation and the effect on a country’s GDP is part of macroeco-
nomics. When talking about individual companies, we are operating in the 
domain of microeconomics. The most basic model in this discipline is the 
so-called supply-and-demand model, which you may be familiar with from 
Economics 101 (see Figure 8-1).
Supply 
Price (p)

Demand 
Figure 8-1.  Classical supply and demand model
What does this model express? Look at the demand curve first. This shows 
how much of a product people buy in relationship to its price. When the price 
of a product is high, such as at point A, the quantity demanded is low. Fewer 
people are able to afford the high price, or people may be unwilling to pay 

University Startups and Spin-Offs
89
more than a certain amount for a certain product. At point B, the price is low, 
and the quantity of products demanded is higher. This is assumed to be the 
case because people can buy more of the good with $100 when the price is 
low than when the price is high.
The supply curve works in a similar way. This curve shows the relationship 
of price and quantity supplied from the manufacturer’s point of view. How 
much of a certain product does the company produce and make available in 
the market in relationship to the price it can charge? Assume the price is high, 
such as at point C. The supplier has an incentive to flood the market with 
product, because the company has the potential to make much more profit 
when it sells the product at a high price. But when the price is low, as at point 
D, the supplier is not interested in producing much, because overall profit is 
lower in a low-price environment. At the point where the supply curve and 
the demand curve intersect, the market is in equilibrium.
This is the story of the supply-and-demand model. Does it make sense to you? 
Most likely it does. But let’s look at an example that flies in the face of this neat 
model and relegates it straight to the garbage bin.
In the last decade, there was a huge boom in real-estate prices. Many investors 
doubled their investment with real-estate speculation in the United States, 
China, and other parts of the world. When prices were low, real estate was 
not that attractive, because most people could not imagine that a sizable 
return would ever come to pass. But when things picked up and prices soared, 
more and more people became interested in real estate and began speculat-
ing. Demand increased as soon as prices increased. Is this what the supply-
and-demand model would predict? No—quite the opposite. Figure 8-2 shows 
how the real-estate boom looks in the supply-and-demand model.

There are now two possible prices for each quantity. One is in the low-price 
environment, where those with little money can purchase a house (E). When 
prices go up, fewer of those people can afford a house, and demand declines. 
Then comes an inflection point (G), where rising prices spur a real-estate 
boom and speculative buying. This designates the beginning of the high-price 
environment. Everybody who can piles into real estate, and demand increases. 
More and more speculators are attracted to the market. They buy second 
and third homes. Demand goes up, and prices go up in tandem (F). In such a 
market, do high prices lead to fewer or more units sold? It depends. There 
may be fewer units sold in a low-price environment, but more units sold in a 
high-price environment. You will not find this supply-and-demand model in an 
introductory economics book, but you may have witnessed the dynamics of 
a real-estate boom firsthand. Would you say the classical supply-and-demand 
model is useful to analyze such a boom, or other transactions in the real 
economy? In this light, probably not. It would lead you to the wrong assump-
tions and might cost you a lot of money. Uncertainty and complexity have no 
place is most economic models.
This goes to show that economists hardly have all the answers, even though 
they like to think they do. If you hire an MBA or economist to work out your 
financial model, the danger is that they will tell you with much authority how 
this has to be done. More often than not, their knowledge is firmly rooted in 
theory, which has proven to be precisely wrong more than once in history. 
Much better than basing your financial model on economic theory is to look 
at the real numbers and comparable firms already active in the market. Pair 
this information with your own assumptions about the future, and make your 
own scenarios.
When I started my first company, I had no idea about economic theory. It felt 
intuitively right to charge the highest price possible for my services. And it 
was clear that I would have to decrease my overhead to increase my profit. 
I knew that I had to cold-call hundreds of potential clients in order to get a 
foot in the door. In your early 20s, you have many things on your mind other 
than cold-calling prospects. How I wanted to destroy that phone at times. Yet 
it was clear that there was no way around it, and the 189 remaining names 
on the list were a stark reminder. No slick business strategy could have saved 
me from doing the real work. Because I knew nobody who would bankroll 
my startup, hiring someone to do the dirty work was out of the picture. Like 
many other entrepreneurs, I had to make do with limited means. Knowledge 
of economic theory would have been nothing more than a distraction. It was 
unnecessary at the time.
Years later, when I actually studied economics at the London School of 
Economics, many “aha!” moments occurred. It was satisfying to know the the-
ory to explain in hindsight why some of my businesses had worked and others 

University Startups and Spin-Offs
91
had not. But I still find economic theory and business school knowledge to be 
of little use for startup entrepreneurs. This is true not only for the simplest 
of all models, the supply-and-demand model we just looked at. Porter’s Five 
Forces to formulate competitive strategy,5 Christensen’s Innovator’s Dilemma,6 
and many other theoretical concepts are nice to know but by no means nec-
essary for startup success. A business consultant for a multinational company 
may benefit from being familiar with some of these concepts, but startup 
entrepreneurs should focus on the tasks at hand with “build, measure, learn” 
and many other practical strategies explained in this book. If you are seriously 
interested in learning more about economics later down the road, then it may 
be worth looking into in more detail. But avoid distracting yourself in your 
first startup. Make all your brain power available for things that really matter.
Never Rely on Specialists
Some entrepreneurs are deeply averse to anything that has to do with finance 
or business modeling. They feel they should focus on the core of their tech-
nology and prefer that someone else handle the rest. Students and research-
ers are not immune to this. Somebody may suggest including an MBA student 
on the founding team to bring in expertise about running a company and 
leading interactions with the world outside the university. I think this is the 
wrong approach. It is like hiring somebody else to go on a holiday for you and 
report back to you in detail about their adventures while you sit on the couch 
at home. Startup entrepreneurship is a learning experience that encompasses 
disciplines outside of your domain. It is a mindset, not a job. With that mindset, 
you should embrace the opportunity to integrate new skills into your life. You 
may discover a talent that you never knew you had.
Luckily, the financial part of a startup is relatively small, so all you have to learn 
are the basic functions of Excel to put together your financial model. More 
than that is not necessary. Nobody expects you to know about depreciation 
schedules and the Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich. Your tax accounting 
should be outsourced to an accountant. They can file your taxes for a few 
hundred dollars. But the financial model cannot be outsourced. It is one of the 
core building blocks of your company that the founders must understand. Each 
time new findings emerge, you should be able to adjust the financial model 
yourself. Handing this off will be a disadvantage for your startup. Figure 8-3 
provides a recap for using financial models effectively.

Sales and marketing are a similar story. Learning how to interact with others 
professionally will be a huge asset to you as an entrepreneur. Engaging third 
parties with a proposition that is in their own best interest applies to more 
than sales and marketing. Giving them actionable next steps to obtain the ben-
efits of your product or service will be at the heart of your startup’s success. 
Forget the cliché of the vacuum salesman who shuffles from door to door 
trying to sell a gadget that nobody needs. Getting others to buy something is 
mostly a communication skill. It has little to do with spending millions of mar-
keting dollars to push your product in front of clients. If they see no obvious 
benefit, they will not buy—it’s as simple as that.
Just as basic finance skills, communication skills need to be native to the start-
up’s original founders; they should not be purchased from an external source. 
As the saying goes, business has only two functions: marketing and innovation. 
Spend a few weeks learning the ropes yourself. Learn to lead engaging discus-
sions with others, and you will lay the centerpiece for your startup success. 
Turning the discussion away from features to the benefits of a technology is 
the first step, and this is a skill best acquired by doing. An MBA (or any other 
degree) has very little to do with sales and marketing success, or business 
success in general. Make yourself a smart and likable person, and sales and 
marketing will become a natural communication process for you.
Explain the underlying assumptions for all numbers in the model.
Explain how you will achieve $100 million in revenues in three to 
five years.
Explain how you will achieve 40% market share.
Is the price you need to charge in line with what customers will pay?
Explain when your company will be profitable.
Think about reducing your fixed and variable costseven more.
Compare your pricing and profit margin to those of competitors.

The Legal Setup 
of Your Startup
Startups are distinct from research projects. They are businesses, not projects. 
For example, different minimum viable products are projects of your startup: 
each may have a budget and a deadline. Thinking of your venture this way 
helps put things into perspective and approach it more professionally.
When you engage people outside the university, they need to perceive your 
startup as a business. Part of this is having the proper legal setup and financial 
structure. However, most university startups are never properly incorporated; 
they put this off until an investor or venture capitalist knocks on the door 
with an investment proposal. This is a classic catch-22. Startups wait to set 
up their business structure until they have interest from an investor; but to 
attract this interest, a professional business structure has to be in place. As 
long as entrepreneurs see their venture as a project they can abandon any-
time, how can they expect serious investors to jump in?
To get out of this feedback loop, the startup’s structure should enter the 
founders’ minds as soon as they decide to launch their company. Until there 
is a business entity, the startup does not exist. It is just a research project and 
an idea.
So far, this book has focused more on the practical aspects of entrepreneur-
ship than the organizational ones. The main goal of the book is to give you 
an outline of how to move your venture forward and engage others who can 
help you develop it in the best way possible. Legal proceedings of company 
foundation, such as agreements between founders and licensing contracts, are 
discussed at length in the business literature. One thing you cannot ignore,

though, is how you set up your startup as a legal entity. You should make the 
move from a research project to a company as soon as possible after you 
decide to become an entrepreneur.
This is particularly important if you plan to scale quickly and want to attract 
joint venture investment or venture capital. If you do not have a proper cor-
porate structure and a corporate bank account, how can a venture capitalist 
invest in your startup? It will be impossible. Change the way your startup is 
perceived by yourself and others by professionally incorporating it. Doing so 
will move you in a new direction when you establish contact with other busi-
nesses and investors.
When I speak about the legal setup of your startup, this does not necessarily 
mean registering a company in your country of residence. Some jurisdictions 
put up high barriers for new businesses, especially those with high taxes or a 
shaky court system. There are many ways to gain legal status with an entity 
incorporated abroad. No investor wants to see their capital eroded by taxes 
and other fees, so be aware that there may be offshore options to consider. 
Explaining them here goes beyond the scope of this book. If you feel you need 
a more complex solution, you should consult a trusted advisor. I only cover 
basic questions of incorporation in this chapter.
In America, several legal entities to conduct business exist. These occur in 
similar forms all around the world. I chose the American jurisdiction because 
it is straightforward to lead the discussion about startup incorporation. The 
terms for legal entities may be different in your particular country, but at 
heart, they will be similar. Let’s now look at the most common structures for 
small and medium enterprises.
 Sole Proprietorship
This is the simplest legal form a company can take. It is basically a one-person 
business with a self-employed founder. You may conduct business under your 
own name, or you can file a DBA (doing business as), which allows you to 
legally use a fictitious company name. Examples are a web designer, a painter, 
a tax consultant, and an ice cream stand. There is no distinction between the 
entrepreneur and the business, so as a sole proprietor you are fully liable for 
all your actions. If you cause damage through the business, you have to pay 
from your personal bank account.
Registration and administrative costs are minimal. Outside investment is 
not straightforward, because a sole proprietorship has no shares to sell. 
Investments are personal loans to the sole proprietor.

Partnership
A legal partnership is a sole proprietorship including more than one person. 
Small ventures are often partnerships. An example would be a group of friends 
buying a house and fixing it up for resale. Again, there is no distinction between 
the owners and the business, so they are fully liable with their personal assets.
Registration and administrative costs are minimal. Outsiders cannot readily 
invest in partnerships. Just as a sole proprietorship, investments are personal 
loans to the partners. Likewise, a partnership does not sell shares.
Limited Liability Company (LLC)
The LLC is a common form of business in America. It can have one or several 
owners and can issue shares. In contrast to the sole proprietorship and the 
partnership, the LLC is considered a separate entity from the owners. There 
is therefore a firewall between the company’s assets and the owners’ assets. 
This is great because you as the founder cannot be held responsible for any 
damages your business or your employees may cause. If the startup incurs any 
cost that it cannot pay back, then creditors will be unable to sue you person-
ally and repossess your TV and your bicycle.
Registration costs range from a few hundred to a thousand dollars, depending 
on the state in which you incorporate. The LLC also comes with some admin-
istrative costs, but these are small. Investment by outsiders is straightforward: 
they simply buy shares in the company from the founders. Loans are also pos-
sible. All in all, this is the legal setup recommended for startups.
Corporation
There are several kinds of corporations: S corporation, C corporation, and so 
on. I will not go into detailed descriptions here. The corporation is one step up 
from the LLC: you could float this company in the stock market and sell shares 
to the public in an IPO. Registration is expensive, and so is administration. You 
also need a unique form of accounting for a corporation, which can be costly. 
Investing in a corporation is clear-cut and simply involves buying shares from 
the shareholders. The legal structure of the corporation makes sense for big-
ger companies. For example, Microsoft and Apple are corporations.
Which Legal Form Should You Choose?
The best form for a startup is often the LLC or a local variation of it. Two 
things are crucial: ease of investment and clarity about ownership. Because 
the distribution of shares in the LLC reflects ownership, one glance at the 
capitalization table explains the whole story.

Chapter 9 | The Legal Setup of Your Startup

This discussion about incorporation is nowhere near exhaustive. Find out if 
the university can hire an attorney who will explain the different legal entities 
to you in detail and help you select the right one for your purpose. Have an 
attorney write the incorporation agreements for you. If the university covers 
this cost, then accept it as a generous gift. If not, then pay the bill yourself. 
Incorporation is standard legal practice and will seldom cost more than a few 
hundred dollars. Taking this step makes you a real business. The sooner you 
address this with your team and the university, the better.
Avoid Ambiguity About Ownership
More than once, I have met with startup entrepreneurs who were months into 
product development and asked them about their legal structure. A puzzled 
look appeared on their faces. They believed I was asking about their informal 
agreements with the university regarding ownership of the product, so they 
answered something like, “All the founders together own 70% of the inven-
tion, university X owns 20%, and professor Y owns 10%.” Did they put this in 
writing? Of course not. What happens if one founder quits? No idea. What if 
a venture capitalist wishes to invest? Silence.
Once the discussion about setting up an LLC has begun, confusion about 
ownership and investment becomes a thing of the past. There can be vest-
ing agreements about shares, so if founders leave before a certain time, their 
ownership will be reduced, often to zero. If outsiders wish to invest in the 
company, which involves nothing more than buying shares from the existing 
shareholders, they can complete the transaction in an afternoon without a 
headache. Entrepreneurs need to have clarity about possible issues related to 
their company before they arise. Ownership of the startup and its assets are 
problem zones that proper legal setup helps clear up.
Make Your Startup Investible as Early as 
Possible
Here’s another philosophy: money is like water. When you make space for it, 
that’s where it will flow and accumulate. Put another way, if you make no space 
for it, money cannot flow to you. You think that is absurd? Bear with me for a 
minute, and let’s look at an example.
Assume you are currently working on a research project at your university. 
In your PhD, you study a certain application of Li-ion battery technology. You 
publish some of your findings and eventually submit your thesis. Would ven-
ture capitalists invest in this PhD project? Most likely not, because there is no 
way for them to do so. Investing in something means buying shares in it or 

University Startups and Spin-Offs

making a loan with interest. The research project has no corporate structure 
as an independent entity. It is just a line item in your university’s annual budget. 
Unless your startup is a proper legal entity, it is a research project.
On the other hand, assume you are working on the same PhD, and you have 
decided to set up a startup based on some of your findings. Your startup exists 
in form of an LLC, where ownership and share distributions are clear. Now 
venture capitalists can invest easily. They know what percentage of revenue 
they will receive, according to the number of shares they buy in your company 
with their investment. Does this mean a venture capitalist will invest? No, of 
course not. But the potential for money to flow to you is there. Without the 
LLC, it is not and never will be.
Never Spend Money to Make Money
You know why rich people have money? Because they keep it and don’t spend 
it. Duh, you may say. That was my reaction when I heard this piece of time-
less wisdom from a neighbor at the age of eight. But three decades later, his 
words still ring in my ears. What will you do if you find a hundred dollars in 
the street? Buy fireworks, or lottery tickets for everyone? Or will you save it 
in the bank at 0.01% interest because you are afraid to be robbed? Whatever 
your answer, your attitude toward money will largely determine your wealth 
and the success of your startup.
Most people complain about money and their lack of it. A tennis partner of 
mine had a film production company. When I asked him how business was, he 
made a sour face and started off on his usual rant. The shrinking margins in the 
business. The new kids on the block who lured away his clients. And the new 
technology that turned everybody and their cousin into filmmakers. Without 
a miracle, he said, he may have to close shop soon. After our tennis match, 
we took out our calendars to set up the next one. This would have to wait a 
few weeks, my friend announced. He would be on another continent, on a golf 
holiday with his wife. When we walked to the parking garage, I couldn’t help 
but notice his brand-new Range Rover. Nice toy, eh? Yes, he always wanted the 
new model XYZ, and because he could trade in his Jaguar, it was a steal. His 
reasoning for driving luxury cars was that he needed to project an aura of suc-
cess to his clients—spending money to make money. What attitude toward 
money does this man have? Not one that is helpful to launch a startup or stay 
in business when times are rough.
A misconception about launching your own company is that it is expensive. 
You need to pay your suppliers, buy computers, rent an office, hire staff, pay 
for expensive advertising and marketing, and so on. Nevertheless, if you are 
launching your startup straight out of university, none of these costs applies to 
you. Even if you cannot fall back on an existing infrastructure, you do not need 
to break the bank. Work out of your house or apartment, attract another 

Chapter 9 | The Legal Setup of Your Startup

founder with skills that complement yours, and launch the company as a team. 
Test your product in the market before you have it mass-produced. And, of 
course, lower your own bills as much as possible.
Even though you may not plan to go on a golf holiday or buy a new luxury car, 
there are still many ways to rein in your monthly bills. Do you really need that 
data plan that sets you back $50 per month? How about HBO and DirecTV 
for another $100 per month? Is the old iPhone really not good enough any-
more? And do you need to take a taxi to the university for $20 each day when 
the train only costs $2? With a few simple adjustments, you may be able to 
save several thousand dollars each year. This can make or break your startup 
in the early phases. As a startup entrepreneur, get used to bootstrapping with 
little or nothing as early as possible. Forget about spending money to make 
money. Even if you have funding, make it a point to use as little as possible and 
spend only when necessary. Use all the synergies and free infrastructure you 
can, as long as possible.
The checklist in figure 9-1 sums up what you need to know about moving 
your startup up a notch.

Communication 
Skills and 
Meetings
Talking about their project with outsiders is an important skill that entre-
preneurs often overlook. How difficult can it be to present something to a 
visitor? Presentation skills are often taken for granted, but in reality, good 
communication is the lifeblood of entrepreneurship. Because startups rarely 
take off in isolation, it is worth spending some time mastering communication 
skills. Students and researchers may find tactics related to communication 
too salesy or otherwise unfit for academics. Overcoming that hurdle is one 
of the points of this book: leave the ivory tower, and get feedback from the 
real market. The sooner university entrepreneurs warm up to this concept, 
the better.
PowerPoint
Researchers are used to presenting their findings to other academics, so they 
naturally assume that they already know how to give talks to third parties. What 
they fail to consider is that non-academics are used to a different presentation 
style and format than academics. A startup entrepreneur should avoid address-
ing potential partners and investors as if they were faculty. I have sat through 
hour-long presentations of 200 mostly unreadable PowerPoint slides, most 
of which the presenter skipped with the remark “I don’t have enough time 
to show this here.” Many of the slides were brimming with justified 12-point 

Chapter 10 | Communication Skills and Meetings

type, intricate diagrams, and tables of even smaller type. In addition to being 
utterly boring, such feature-laden demonstrations lack any actionable steps to 
engage the audience. Presenters simply beam data down to the listener, and 
when the time or the information runs out, they stop. This may be OK when 
you are presenting to a specialist who has an interest in such detail, or anyone 
unfamiliar with a better presentation style. However, when pitching a potential 
joint venture partner or investor, such a practice may reflect badly on you. It 
shows that you are going through the motions with little understanding of how 
the business and investing world works.
To be fair, it is not only individuals from universities who lack presentation 
skills. Most presentations given by startups and multinational corporations are 
rather dismal. There is a lot room for improvement in all domains. Effective 
communication is never a one-way street. It is not just a question of telling but 
also of listening. Entrepreneurs are hardly the only people who must learn this.
So how can a startup make its presentations more palatable? Let’s establish a 
few ground rules and technical parameters that make it much easier to tailor 
your presentations to diverse audiences and applications.
The 10/20/30 Rule
A framework often used in Silicon Valley is the 10/20/30 rule put forward by 
author Guy Kawasaki: 10 slides, 20 minutes, minimum font size of 30 points.1 
This technique is daunting for most people on first sight. However, it works. You 
must fit all the essential information on ten slides, excluding the title slide. What 
information, you ask? Most third parties want to see the following points:
1.	 Problem
2.	 Your solution
3.	 Sales and business model
4.	 Technology
5.	 Marketing and sales
6.	 Competition
7.	 Team
8.	 Projections and milestones
9.	 Status and timeline
10.	 Short summary and call to action (next steps)
1Guy Kawasaki, The Art of the Start: The Time-Tested, Battle-Hardened Guide for Anyone Starting 
Anything (New York: Portfolio, 2004).

When you pitch to a joint venture partner, you may adjust some of the slides. 
Instead of a sales and business model, at point 3, you may put the partner-
ship model that you imagine. You may omit point 5, marketing and sales, and 
replace it with distribution channels. 10/20/30 is open and malleable, as long 
as you follow the iron rule of a maximum of 10 slides with a minimum font 
size of 30.
The most important slide is number 10: the call to action. Only with this last 
step will you engage your audience. Never leave your audience with the task 
of coming up with the next steps to take. If lunchtime is five minutes away, 
they will rarely spend much effort on this. As an entrepreneur, you need to 
do the thinking for other people and tell them what you want them to do for 
you. This is also where your one-page proposal fits, as an extension of this 
final slide.
The large font size is paramount for several reasons. First, when you present 
with a projector, the contrast in the room may be weak, and small fonts will 
be unreadable. You could darken the room, but then people will fall asleep. It is 
best to avoid this problem by using at least a 30-point font size. Second, when 
you print a presentation and show it on paper, the people you are presenting 
to may have bad eyesight. Most of them will skip unreadable tiny print and will 
politely nod, so you will never know that most of the information went over 
their head. And finally, because a large font acutely limits the space available 
per slide, it forces you to condense. Cut out anything that is unnecessary. 
Producing a lot of text is easy; the magic lies in making your presentation 
concise. People have gotten used to reading 140-character Twitter messages 
that include a lot of information, so you will be at an advantage if you master 
the skill of keeping it short. (By the way: the same goes for e-mails and any 
other written documents. The shorter, the better.) You can still make a long 
version and include links to your in-depth publications, should anyone ask for 
them. Most people have little time and just want to find out the overall gist of 
your project.
What about tables, which need to use a much smaller font size to fit on the 
slide? What does not fit has to go. Simply omit anything that is incompat-
ible with the 10/20/30 framework. You can always convey the same infor-
mation with fewer words. Figure 10-1 is an example from an actual project  
I was working on: this is the original slide with some names obscured. It con-
tains information about the benefits of a certain platform for patent-licensing 
offices. The 15-point font is difficult to read, especially from a distance. The 
colored table format provided by PowerPoint looks good in print, but the 
contrast is too weak for an overhead presentation. The audience starts read-
ing at top left, makes their way down to the second line, and then gives up. 
You may be talking or explaining what you mean to say with this table, but the 
slide and your words will be incongruent. As you may have guessed, this slide 
is unpresentable.

Chapter 10 | Communication Skills and Meetings
102
Figure 10-2 shows how to improve this slide. Even though it contains more 
or less the same information, this version looks clean and makes sense at a 
glance. There is no fancy formatting: just clear information. On the left you see 
the beneficiaries, and on the right, the benefits. The columns for the motiva-
tion and contribution of each party are unnecessary to drive home the point 
that the platform has value, so you eliminate them.
Omit all information that confuses the story or makes it difficult to under-
stand. If anyone has specific questions, they can ask after your presentation, 
which only lasts 20 minutes. This leaves the audience with enough energy 
to follow up if something is important. If the missing details are key for the 
overall story, you can print the table and make it available to those who wish 
to know more.
Assume you are in a day-long workshop to hammer out the terms of a poten-
tial project. Each speaker has one hour to make a presentation. Instead of 
fretting about how to fit your 200 slides into 60 minutes, stick to the 10/20/30 
rule. Speak for 20 minutes, and then get feedback from the other attendees. 
What exactly is their problem? How have they addressed it in the past? Has 
this worked for them? Why or why not? What happens if they keep doing 
what they have been doing? How could your solution better solve their prob-
lem? Use the SPIN technique described in Chapter 5 to link the benefits you

103
can bring to the table to the needs of the other parties. Your presentation 
becomes a platform for discussion, and you engage others in your project.
Communication about your startup goes far beyond PowerPoint. It is a skill 
and a mindset that applies to all your interactions with others. Once you have 
internalized a few ground rules, you can apply them to various situations.
Have a Backup Plan Ready
It goes without saying that if you need to hook your computer to a projector, 
you should do this before the presentation to make sure everything works. If 
the projector fails to link up with your laptop, have the presentation available 
on a USB stick and use another machine. As a last resort, bring a printout of 
the presentation that you can photocopy if all else fails. When the presenta-
tion begins, you should have checked that everything works and should have 
taken all possible steps to make it work. Blaming the technology or the techni-
cian and shrugging your shoulders will only reflect badly on you, so do not go 
there. It is your full responsibility to make your presentation work.
Elevator Pitch and Micro-Scripts
It can always happen that you meet someone in the proverbial elevator, and 
they ask you what you are currently working on. As a startup entrepreneur, be 
ready to pitch your project at all times. Who knows? Perhaps the other person 
Figure 10-2.  PowerPoint slide after applying 10/20/30

Chapter 10 | Communication Skills and Meetings
104
can help you with something, or works on a similar project, or can introduce 
you to an influential contact. This is when your elevator pitch comes in handy. 
It is a highly condensed synopsis of what your startup is about and why it 
matters. This pitch should come across naturally without sounding rehearsed. 
Keep it simple, and focus on the most prominent points of your venture.
The following practice to craft your elevator pitch comes from advertising. Yes, 
you heard right: you are creating an advertising slogan for your university startup. 
Before you decide that this is too cheesy and un-scientific, remind yourself that 
you are not publishing your elevator pitch in Nature. It is just a brief summary 
of the benefits your startup delivers to a client. Businesspeople are used to such 
pitches, and when you apply them intelligently, they work great in academia.
Micro-script rules, developed by author Bill Schley, are excellent building blocks 
for elevator pitches.2 “It’s not what other people hear, it’s what they want to 
repeat,” as he puts it. The following set of simple rules helps create a short, 
memorable message that drives home the main point about what you want to 
communicate. In creating your micro-script, stick to the following guidelines:
1.	 One attribute.
2.	 The narrower your focus, the wider the message goes.
3.	 Simple always wins. The average length of successful 
scripts is less than six words.
4.	 Be specific.
There are further rules, but these are the ones I find most workable.
Now you have a recipe to cook up your elevator pitch. Let’s see how this works 
with an example. For this, we go back to the battery startup from Chapter 2. 
What is their product’s one quality? Potential candidates are “rechargeable in 
ten minutes” and “biodegradable.” Because “rechargeable” did not make the 
cut in MVP testing, this is easy: we focus on “biodegradable.” The narrow focus 
means the startup’s first product is a car battery, as they found out in MVP 
testing. Specificity means the battery is not just “good for the environment”: 
it is so many times better, or it saves so many lives or so much soil or water 
from contamination. For illustration purposes, some possible micro-scripts for 
the battery startup are as follows:
“The biodegradable car battery that reduces water pollution from heavy met-
als by 50%.”
“Each car battery helps protect one acre of farmland from heavy metal 
pollution.”
“The car battery that dissolves to compost.”
2Bill Schley, The Micro-Script Rules (New York: N. W. Widener, 2010).

University Startups and Spin-Offs
105
It is helpful to avoid touting the features of your technology, but rather the 
benefits. A feature would be the chemical composition of the battery acid. It’s 
better to speak about the benefit of biodegradability, which listeners can then 
repeat to other people after they hear the micro-script.
This is just an example to show that you need to be creative with your micro-
scripts. Write down several of them, and test which ones work best. These 
short sentences can be the building blocks of your elevator pitch.
So how do you use your elevator pitch? Let’s find out with a fictitious example. 
Assume the following situation: Ben and Christine from the battery startup 
are waiting at a taxi stand. In line right behind them, Ben notices the CEO of 
Big Battery Corporation (BBC) waiting for a cab. Ben recognizes the CEO 
from a news article he saved—he wanted to write a letter to BBC about a 
potential joint venture. The taxi line is barely moving, and Ben figures he has 
three minutes to speak with the CEO. He seizes the opportunity and intro-
duces himself.
Ben: “Hi, Mr. CEO. I recognized you from the article in The Business Post last 
month. My name is Ben, and this is Christine. We just founded a battery com-
pany. Here is my card.”
CEO: “OK …”
Ben: “We are working on a biodegradable car battery that can reduce water 
pollution from heavy metals by 50%. We’re testing the battery now in the 
market with very good results.’
CEO: “Hm.”
Ben: “Yes. I planned to write to your R&D department and introduce our 
company. We are currently looking for a joint venture partner to raise some 
funding. We are actually raising $250,000 right now, which should be enough 
for the next six months to refine the technology, and I would like to ask your 
company if …”
CEO: (Interrupting Ben) “Listen, it’s 10 p.m., and I had a busy day. We 
already work on similar technology and have no headroom for another joint 
venture.”
Ben: “Oh, really!?” (Long pause.) “Uhm, OK. Well, good luck with the technol-
ogy you are working on …”
Did this go well? Not at all. But that happens when you forget to rehearse 
your elevator pitch and are unclear about what you want from the other 
party as the actionable next step. Even though Ben started out fine with his 
micro-script, the rest of his elevator pitch was much too straightforward. 
Begging others for money is the last thing that should come across in your 
elevator pitch. Instead, focus on what you can do for the other party. Move the 

Chapter 10 | Communication Skills and Meetings
106
conversation just one step forward by breaking down your goals into smaller 
steps. If you move ahead steadily in interactions with others, you will reach 
the goal faster than if you try for a home run every time. Let’s rewind and see 
how the situation could have played out better:
Ben: “Hi, Mr. CEO. I recognized you from the article in the The Business Post 
last month. My name is Ben, and this is Christine. We just founded a battery 
company. Here is my card.”
CEO: “OK …”
Ben: “We are working on a biodegradable car battery that can reduce water 
pollution from heavy metals by 50%. We’re testing the battery now in the 
market with very good results.”
CEO: “Hm.”
Ben: “Yes. I planned to write to your R&D department and introduce our tech-
nology. It could be in line with your new sustainable product line Z. Would it 
be possible for us to make a presentation?”
CEO: “Listen, it’s 10 p.m., and I had a busy day. Why don’t you call the office 
and set something up with R&D?”
Ben: “Great, I will do that. Oh, here’s a cab. Why don’t you go ahead of us? 
Have a safe drive home, and we’ll be in touch tomorrow.”
Was this interaction successful? I think so. Even though the CEO was still 
grumpy, Ben got to the next base. He of course still has a long way to go to 
secure funding and a joint venture, but he is one step closer to a potential 
partner. The CEO has no reason to reject him. Ben can contact BBC tomor-
row and refer to the CEO’s recommendation to call the office. He may even 
send a greeting card to the CEO and thank him for his time and his suggestion 
to call. Thereby he has set up a link to a potential partner that may be of much 
value to both of them down the road.
Prepare and Rehearse Your Pitch
Your message has to be clear and refined, and this never comes overnight. 
Most important, whenever you give your elevator pitch to someone, do not 
ramble. This is a sure deal-breaker. Keep it simple and short, and use memo-
rable phrases like your micro-scripts. Make sure you give the other person 
enough space to breathe, and take breaks between your sentences. To deliver 
your messages with perfection, make sure you have rehearsed them properly. 
It is more difficult than you think to bring across your information confidently 
and still make it sound unrehearsed. This needs practice. But it is well worth 
doing and will go a long way.

University Startups and Spin-Offs
107
Get your team together, and start pitching to each other. See which micro-
scripts work well by testing them frequently in casual conversations. Practice 
does not always have to be in front of the mirror. Get in the habit of obtaining 
feedback about your ideas everywhere you go. Over time, this prepares you 
to get it right and make it sound natural at the same time.
Unless you practice your elevator pitch, the right words will elude you under 
stress. As the example of Ben and the CEO shows, always think in terms of 
next steps. If you can advance the dialogue, it is successful. Interactions that 
linger in indecision are unsuccessful and a huge time waster. If you fail to pay 
attention, you may not notice this is the case, with actionable steps postponed 
from one meeting to the next. When you are setting up a meeting, clearly 
think about what you want from it.
What Is the Actionable Next Step?
Being too straightforward right away is a turnoff. The first contact should just 
be about getting to next base, in this case a formal meeting to present your 
technology. It could also be MVP testing with a company already active in the 
marketplace. Or general feedback about your approach and your assumed 
target market. When you meet a person in the elevator, refrain from push-
ing your entire PowerPoint pitch deck on them. The actionable next step is 
to organize a meeting where you and your team present the entire pitch. 
Whatever it is you want, be clear to approach it in small steps.
With the SPIN questions (situation, problem, implication, need-payoff), it is 
much easier to frame the discussion around the benefits of your products 
instead of their features. Going into the meeting to “just get to know” the 
other party is not enough and will rarely move the interaction forward. With 
this, you are depriving yourself and the other party of potential value that 
could come out of a potential collaboration down the road.
Note how all the techniques and the work done on your startup so far build 
on each other. With MVP testing and the business model canvas, you found 
your unique value propositions, which you highlight in your elevator pitch. 
With your financial model, you can lead an informed discussion about pricing 
and your needs when it comes to forming a joint venture or raising investment. 
And the right communication skills tie it all together. Without them, nothing 
else would matter because you would be unable to bring it across when you 
meet a decision maker. The strategies outlined in this book are straightforward 
and may even seem simplistic at times. However, putting them all together, you 
will end up with a workable approach to entrepreneurship that has been suc-
cessful for many startups. Only when you have a clear picture of your startup 
can you express the exact next steps you want others to take on your behalf.

Take Control of Unexpected Situations
Have you ever given an interview to the news media? They are usually very 
short, sometimes just 30 seconds. The interviewer asks a generic question, 
and you answer the best you can until the next question rolls around or the 
interview is over. Most people are in a reactive mode during an interview, and 
this is not how an entrepreneur should use this opportunity. Instead of nicely 
answering the interviewer’s questions, have your pitch ready, and be prepared 
with the story that you want the world to know.
Let’s see how this works with another fictitious example. Assume there was 
a volcanic eruption in Indonesia yesterday, and a news team is now filming an 
interview at your university. As the team lead on the volcanic-eruption mod-
ule, you are slated for the interview. Let’s see how this unfolds:
Interviewer: “As a leading expert in volcanic-eruption modeling, what is your 
prediction for future volcanic activity in Indonesia?”
If you are like most people, you will respond the best you can to the ques-
tion about volcanic activity in Indonesia. After all, that’s what the interviewer 
wanted to know, right? Perhaps you say that no models could predict what 
happened and that we do not know when the next eruption will be. Or per-
haps you speak about the history of eruptions and note that this one was 
actually long overdue. You play nice with the interviewer and tell her what she 
needs for her news bite. She will politely thank you and move on to the next 
news item. This is how most such interviews progress.
Assume, however, that in addition to being a leading expert on volcanic activ-
ity in Indonesia, you are also a startup entrepreneur. The startup you incor-
porated two days ago, let’s call it Seismic Software, already has a tentative joint 
venture pact with a multinational sensor company, SensorX. You have worked 
on a model that has in lab tests outperformed other models. You feel it has a 
wide variety of applications not only in eruption modeling but also for earth-
quakes, tsunamis, terrestrial explosions, and so on. By chance, you find yourself 
standing in front of a camera for the national news media, and a reporter asks 
you about the volcano in Indonesia. What do you do? You can play along with 
the interviewer and give the generic answer that 99% of all other research-
ers would give because they are excited to be on TV. Or you can hijack this 
opportunity and take matters into your own hands:
Interviewer: “As a leading expert in volcanic-eruption modeling, what is your 
prediction for future volcanic activity in Indonesia?”
You: “Thanks for asking me this question. This latest activity in Indonesia has 
been largely a surprise, which is mainly because most models date back ten 
years. My team and I at Seismic Software are working on an advanced model 
that holds much promise. We predict not only eruptions like the one we 
have just seen, but also earthquakes and tsunamis up to ten minutes earlier 

University Startups and Spin-Offs
109
than current systems in use. We’re currently testing our model in Japan with 
SensorX, our joint venture partner. The first tests are promising, and it will be 
exciting to see how we can improve prediction in the future. In fact, this short 
simulation video shows how we predict future eruptions with our software.” 
(Shows 20-second video clip on a laptop.) “You see here how we get a clear 
signal of seismic activity about ten minutes before the felt impact on land. This 
is mainly thanks to the way our software communicates with the SensorX 
sensors. In this video, you see our team from Seismic Software at a test site in 
Indonesia.” (Shows other 20-second video clip.) And so on, and so forth.
What just happened? The interview is now about your company and your 
product and not about Indonesia. If the interviewer has time for another ques-
tion, she will most likely follow up on your model, your tests, or your company. 
Or she may want to show your videos with the credit of your company in the 
news bit. Do not worry about talking too long—the news team can always 
edit your interview. The elevator pitch should be short, that’s true. But that 
applies when you pitch under time constraints. When you have the chance to 
tell your story to the world on the news, you should have a lot of interesting 
material to talk about. In the example, you made a powerful pitch that put 
your own company and also your joint venture partner in the spotlight on the 
national news. Make sure to exchange business cards with the film crew and 
anyone else on the set. You could double up and invite the news crew to your 
lab to film a special report about prediction software.
You never know what these encounters may lead to. The most important 
thing to remember is that entrepreneurs first and foremost have the benefit 
of their own company in mind. When there is a chance to get a platform, make 
the platform your own. You could not possibly buy the visibility you get from 
these opportunities.
A Word about NDAs and Confidentiality
Attorneys advise you to have third parties sign a non-disclosure agreement 
(NDA) when you show those parties confidential information about a tech-
nology and want to discourage them from copying or stealing your invention. 
If you have a patent (pending), then your invention is somewhat protected 
from plagiarism, but you still have to enforce against potential infringement. 
This can be time-consuming and expensive. An NDA should, in theory, protect 
you from intellectual property theft. The reality is that NDAs are impractical. 
Better than relying on NDAs and patent protection is keeping the crucial parts 
of your invention under wraps. My experience has shown that an NDA often 
frames a discussion in a negative light, because it presupposes the other party 
will naturally steal your intellectual property. Many venture capitalists will tell 
you straight out that they never sign NDAs. If you insist, the meeting is over.

Chapter 10 | Communication Skills and Meetings
110
A better strategy than an NDA is incremental disclosure. First, by focusing 
mostly on the benefits of your technology and not the features, you avoid 
revealing the secrets behind your invention. In the example of the battery 
startup, they should avoid disclosing their product’s chemical composition in 
the first meeting. But they should highlight all the benefits it brings: biode-
gradable up to X%, contains no heavy metals, protects water and soil, and so 
forth. When the potential joint venture partner asks sensitive questions, you 
sidestep with the answer that you can discuss those in a later meeting. If your 
invention is obvious—for example, if one glimpse at the battery immediately 
tells the other party about the technology behind it—then leave it in your top 
secret lab. Bring a mock-up or a diagram with the sensitive parts obscured. 
The more the relationship progresses, the more you show. When you have 
signed a joint venture agreement, then all the intellectual property is shared, 
and there are no more secrets. Only when you think in terms of features, not 
benefits, will you be afraid of intellectual property theft.
What Should You Bring to a Meeting?
Let’s say you have a first presentation with a potential joint venture partner. How 
do you approach it? Let’s revisit the collateral you have produced so far and see 
how they are put to good use. This is what you should bring to a meeting:
1.	 Short summary for the meeting, with points to discuss
2.	 PowerPoint presentation on a laptop or printed
3.	 Business model canvas
4.	 Financial model
5.	 One-page proposal, if you have something to propose
6.	 Additional materials
Let’s look at each item in more detail.
Points to Discuss
When you go to a meeting, make sure you are coming from a position of 
preparedness and strength, not from a stance of begging for sponsorship or 
capital. The grant track focuses startups exclusively on securing funding from 
day one, but capital is hardly the most important asset others can provide. 
When you approach others, their experience and the synergies they bring are 
the most valuable assets for your startup.
Make it a point to lead the meeting with confidence. As an entrepreneur, you 
want to come across as goal-oriented and determined. When you communi-
cate this way and the other party reacts strangely or withdraws, then you may 

University Startups and Spin-Offs
111
have found out that they are not up to speed to work with you. Be glad you 
recognized this early. Use the meeting to show your worth and to test the 
other party regarding their ability and commitment.
Business Model Canvas or Lean Canvas
Whichever canvas you choose (I recommend the lean canvas), you should 
tailor it to the other party in each presentation. Parts of the canvas will flow 
into your PowerPoint presentation: for example, the slides where you explain 
the problem, solution, business model, and so forth. You may bring several 
canvases to address specific situations, such as your joint venture partner’s 
market and also the global market. Because you open the meeting with the 
PowerPoint presentation, the canvases are just backups in case the discussion 
progresses beyond the most obvious points.
Financial Model
Even though a joint venture partner will value your company on their own 
terms, the financial model is important to show the assumptions under which 
you operate. Do you project $1 million in sales or $100 million? Does your 
product cost one dollar or one cent? What is the potential profit margin, and 
what are the effects of scale economies?
The underlying logic of your startup and the market are more important than 
the numbers in the model. They show others how you think and operate. 
Make sure you explain your assumptions concisely as well. Bring the financial 
model with the output printed on one page for easy discussion.
One-Page Proposal
This document condenses onto a single page the entire discussion about your 
proposal for a joint venture or other proposition: your status quo, what you 
can do for the other party, and what you want them to do for you. Of course, 
never break out a joint venture proposal at the first meeting, before you even 
know the other party and have an understanding about how you could work 
together. This proposal makes sense when you have met the other party sev-
eral times and are ready to extend or receive an offer. You can also prepare 
several different proposals.
In any event, before you go into a meeting, know what you want out of it. In 
a first meeting, you should ask for a follow-up meeting to discuss other parts 
of the technology, or get feedback on an MVP, or look at the joint venture 
partner’s processes to learn something new.

Chapter 10 | Communication Skills and Meetings
112
Technical Drawings, Sketches, Photographs
You should bring anything to the meeting that makes the point of your prod-
uct being valuable to the other party, unless it gives away your intellectual 
property. If you have photographs of people using the technology, or drawings, 
or certain statistics that make a point, then bring those printed on separate 
pages. You will rarely need to show everything; just have more material ready 
as a backup.
What Should You Leave After the Meeting?
Print out the ten-page PowerPoint presentation and leave it there, unless it 
contains confidential information. Do not leave the lean canvas, the financial 
model, or any of your technical drawings. If you have presented a one-page 
proposal, leave that also, because you want a reply in the next few days regard-
ing the next steps. Other than that, avoid flooding the other party with paper. 
You should make a sharp impression with your presentation and leave them 
wanting more.
Business Cards
Do you need your own business cards? Well, of course. When you are out 
and about as an entrepreneur, avoid giving people the card from your univer-
sity. Print your own business cards at a professional copy center. They should 
include the following information:
Your name and degree: for example, Dr. X, MBA.
• 
Your title at the company: for example, CEO.
• 
The name of the company.
• 
The address of the university lab where your startup is 
• 
hopefully based in the beginning.
Your personal mobile phone number.
• 
Your personal e-mail address. Get your own dot-com 
• 
domain for your startup at a web-hosting company like 
Godaddy.com. This costs about $15 per year and comes 
with free e-mail accounts. Setting up your page and e-mail 
address takes ten minutes. This looks infinitely better 
than a faculty e-mail or Gmail address.
Your title is important. First-time entrepreneurs are often unsure about 
their role in the company. Are they the founder, the chief executive officer 
(CEO), the chief scientist, or all of the above? Avoid using the title Founder.  

University Startups and Spin-Offs
113
If you are the boss of your team, then use the title CEO, or Managing Director, 
or President. If you are working more in the background on technical issues, 
put CTO (chief technical officer) or CIO (chief information officer). Read 
about these abbreviations on Wikipedia, and choose the one that best fits 
what you are doing. Use only one title, even if you have several roles.
The Business Lunch
A business lunch is distinctly different from getting together with your friends 
and family at a restaurant. The focus is on business, not on lunch. Eating together 
and sharing food is a gesture of goodwill among humans today just as it was 
in ancient times. It is more informal and cordial to meet over pizza than in 
a conference room. The topics discussed during the lunch are also different 
from those in a meeting, but they are still based on the premise of benefits 
over features, asking instead of telling, and actionable next steps.
I discuss the business lunch in a little more detail than the other skills in this 
chapter. This is because it is easy to spot a beginner during a business lunch. 
A great number of entrepreneurs blunder their way through lunches and lose 
much previously gained respect as a result of their amateurish behavior. I have 
no intention to micromanage your business lunches; this discussion simply 
shows you the moving parts that come together in this meeting ritual that 
looks so simple on the surface.
Let’s assume you had a brief meeting at a science summit with the CEO of a 
company that you may want to partner with later. You exchange cards, and he 
suggests that you get together for lunch sometime. You set up a meeting next 
week at a restaurant close to the CEO’s office. How do you make the most of 
this meeting (see Figure 10-3)?

Chapter 10 | Communication Skills and Meetings
114
First, be sure you are early. Familiarize yourself with the place, and then wait 
for the other party to arrive. Do not arrive at the restaurant starving. Make 
sure you ate a good breakfast and perhaps a little snack just before lunch 
to avoid arriving at the restaurant undernourished, only thinking about food. 
Wolfing down your lunch seldom makes a good impression. In general, let the 
other party order first, and then order something similar. If it turns out the 
other person is a vegetarian, then refrain from ordering a bloody steak; order 
a small soup dish or salad. Always order a small plate so you have more time 
to address the issues you would like to discuss. Definitely avoid messy food, 
such as crab legs or anything similar, unless the other party orders the same 
and insists that you join them.
It is a good practice to stay away from alcohol at lunch, even if the other per-
son orders a beer or glass of wine. You are not drinking buddies just yet. If it 
happens that the two of you become friends, then it is of course OK to go 
out drinking, but the first lunch meeting is hardly the time to drink together. 
Apply common sense. Make sure your lunch does not interfere with the busi-
ness part of the meeting.
When it comes to paying the bill, the CEO will most likely invite you, but 
have enough cash on hand to cover your part. Offer to split the check. Be 
as persistent as you must, depending on your local customs. When you are 
invited, thank the other party for the lunch. However, never assume because 
somebody is richer or older than you that they must pay your bill. A sense of 
entitlement can be a deal breaker.
You need to have your business agenda planned in your head when you go 
to the lunch. Do not bring any paper, such as bound prints of PowerPoint 
presentations, unless the other person expressly asked you to bring them. 
Remember, you want to move each interaction to the next one. If the CEO 
wants to see more, then set up the next meeting where you will show your 
full presentation. Most first-time entrepreneurs make the mistake of wanting 
to hit a home run right out of the gate. That is hardly how relationship building 
Never go to a business lunch hungry.
Have a clear picture of what you want from the other party.
Break that down into smaller, actionable next steps.
The goal is to get a follow-up meeting.
Do not feel entitled to be invited.

works. Move step by step. The business lunch is a good opportunity to suss 
out the other party informally, get to know their opinion, and then present 
actionable next steps. What those are should be clear to you before you go 
to the lunch.
Let’s assume you want to ask the CEO if he can sponsor your product devel-
opment with hardware. In a first meeting, such a commitment might be a 
stretch. What would the CEO get out of it: perhaps access to your other 
testing data, or insight you gained in developing prototypes? Present some-
thing of value before you ask for anything. Try to find out whether the CEO 
already has the data you collected. See if it would be helpful if you shared your 
findings. Ask him how his team approached a certain problem that you are 
struggling with. Offer the insight you gained from solving a similar problem. 
As the actionable next step, offer to show him some of your results directly 
at his company’s R&D lab. In that next meeting, you can begin inquiring about 
the possibility of potentially working together, perhaps by using their lab or 
some of their hardware.
Every meeting exists to lay the groundwork for the next one. Look at your 
meetings this way, and you will see them in a whole new light.
You Can Always Ask
As an entrepreneur, you must let go of your fear of asking other people to do 
things for you. Of course, I am not suggesting you bum out your friends with 
silly requests to buy dinner for you or let you crash on their couch for free 
with no end in sight. Those kinds of favors only go so far and end up alienating 
everyone around you. I mean well-researched requests that you may want to 
ask others to fulfill.
Let’s assume you want to meet the CEO of a company with which you would 
eventually like to form a joint venture. You have no personal connection to 
this CEO yet, nor does anyone in your network. At the same time, you think 
it would be good to get on the radar of her firm and hear her feedback about 
your MVP. What do you do? You should make contact with the CEO and ask 
her for a meeting to get her feedback about your early-stage product. Most 
people are open to giving their opinion about your work. They want to help 
others, especially if they can identify with them in one form or another. But 
remember that all relationships are give and take.
How do you contact somebody you have never met? Luckily, there is the 
Internet, which solves many of our problems. Most CEOs have an account on 
LinkedIn; make sure you connect there first. But a hurdle comes up: to con-
nect with a person on LinkedIn, you often need to know their e-mail address 
or show that you have some other connection with them.

Chapter 10 | Communication Skills and Meetings
116
You can often guess e-mail addresses from the URL of a company. Most of 
them use the format first-name.last-name@company.com. Try that and see if it 
works. You can also say that you are a friend of the CEO. Sometimes you can 
choose a LinkedIn group that you are both a member of: join the same group 
as the CEO, and off you go. Try a few times, and see what happens. Eventually 
it will be possible to connect.
Why not simply send an e-mail to the company? E-mails from strangers fall 
by the wayside: most decision-makers receive hundreds of them each day. It is 
better to use alternative channels, if they are available.
Of course, you can also call the company and ask for a meeting. I recommend 
this only if you are well advanced on the path of MVP testing and can make 
the case for providing value to the company. Only go into a meeting if you are 
prepared and ready with actionable next steps for the other party. Never go 
“just to get to know them.” This will annoy the other party and make the next 
meeting more difficult to get when you need it.
With that in mind, you can meet anybody you desire in this world. Celebrities, 
billionaires, Nobel laureates—they are all just people in the end. If you appre-
ciate their time and engage them in the right way with something they per-
ceive to be of value, you will eventually prevail.
I once wanted to meet a famed investor to get his feedback on a project of 
mine in Asia. Because he ran several investment funds that had been active 
in Southeast Asia and China for over two decades, I was sure he would have 
some insight about these markets based on his experience. He often appears 
on CNBC and Bloomberg TV, speaks at various investment conferences, and 
is generally perceived as a jet setter, so chances were slim that this man would 
ever lend his time to me. So how did I approach this challenge?
First I sent an e-mail to his investment company in Hong Kong, not sure 
whether an executive assistant would screen them. For three weeks, I sent 
an e-mail each Tuesday morning with the request for a meeting in either of 
the two locations where he has homes. These e-mails went unanswered. So 
I switched to LinkedIn, as mentioned earlier. But there were several accounts 
with his name, some obviously fake. I connected with the two that looked real. 
To do that, I used the Classmate feature with my alma mater, for lack of a bet-
ter alternative. Surprisingly, a few days later, both connection requests were 
approved. Once you connect on LinkedIn, you can see your new friend’s full 
profile and send them messages. That is what I did:
Dear X,
I would like to introduce myself in person to you. Would you be available for 
ten minutes this or next week by phone or in person? I am happy to meet you 
either in Y or in Z, at your leisure.

University Startups and Spin-Offs
117
Notice that my first message contained no flattery about that person’s achieve-
ments. There was no word about admiring his work. Such statements put you 
in the position of a fan. Nobody wants to be friends with a fan. They only 
want to be friends with people on the same wavelength. There was also no 
time lost explaining who I was. That information was visible on my LinkedIn 
profile. Keep these introductory e-mails as short as you possibly can. Omit 
all fluff, and get right to the point. What did I want as the first action? I could 
have written that I wanted feedback about an idea, but this would have been 
an immediate turn-off. I just wanted to get face time. Afterward, I could bring 
forth my request for a follow-up meeting to present my project. You cannot 
force others to interact with you, but you can lead them gently with patience 
and persistence.
The answer I received was brief:
Sorry, I’m traveling.
At least there was a direct line now. What do you do when someone obvi-
ously has no time and no motivation to meet with you?  Do you become a 
nuisance and pepper them with requests until they give in? They never will. 
You will brand yourself a spammer and will end up on their blocked list. 
Or do you put the ball in their court, sending your phone number and  
asking them to connect when they have time? You will never hear from them. 
Instead, be politely persistent, yet respectful of their time. You can always  
ask—but ask the right thing at the right time. This is a delicate skill that takes 
time to master.
It took two months until my first meeting with the investor came to pass. The 
first meeting took place in a “gentlemen’s bar.” I introduced myself and told 
the investor that I was an entrepreneur, and that some of my ventures had 
been in the Internet space. Before the meeting, I had prepared several sug-
gestions for the investor’s personal blog, which could have used a makeover.  
I had also mapped out a strategy for a mobile app and a podcast that he might 
consider to reach a wider audience. All this I gave away without asking any-
thing in return. This was about providing value to the other party and estab-
lishing the notion that this was not to be a one-sided interaction. I noticed 
that he relaxed slightly. He had probably expected an investment proposal, 
or a request for advice. Instead, most of this discussion circled around digital 
strategy and how he could use it to his advantage. This meeting was engaging 
and lasted several hours.
After that first meeting, it took another two months to set up the next. This 
time I asked for the investor’s opinion about an idea I had been working on. 
About five one-sentence e-mails later, mostly stating that he had no time or 
was abroad, the get-together was finally organized. Printed PowerPoint pre-
sentation in hand, I arrived at that same bar. Two hours later, all the bar girls 
had introduced themselves to me, but the investor had not shown himself.  

Chapter 10 | Communication Skills and Meetings
118
It dawned on me that this would most likely not happen today. When I returned 
to the hotel, I wrote a short e-mail asking whether everything was OK and 
whether a meeting in the next few days might be more convenient. The temp-
tation to give up is strong in such a situation, and so is the danger of choosing 
the wrong words. Never write an e-mail when you’re angry or disappointed. 
Keeping it simple and to the point is the way to go.
Long story short, I eventually got what I wanted. The investor gave valuable 
feedback about the idea and even introduced a contact of his to help develop 
it further. This interaction was two-sided, and that is why it was productive. 
Few startup entrepreneurs I meet are thinking about first providing value to 
others. You can of course only provide value to others if you have something 
to say that cannot be read in a book. This is another reason to develop skills 
beyond your area of expertise: you never know when you or something else 
can use them.
Figure 10-4 sums up the most important points about meetings and commu-
nication skills.
Rewrite your PowerPoint presentation in the 10/20/30 format.
Rehearse it and make sure it is shorter than 20 minutes.
Create micro-scripts and an elevator pitch. Rehearse them.
Create lean canvasses, one for each situation of your startup. 
Make sure your financial model is ready and that you can explain the 
assumptions.
Make a short list of points to discuss at each meeting.
Frame your value in terms of benefits, not features.
Prepare a one-page proposal for each meeting.
Know what you want from the other party, and articulate the next 
steps.

Startup Grants: 
Can Government 
Programs 
Stimulate 
Entrepreneurship?
A discussion about startup entrepreneurship out of universities would be 
incomplete without touching on the subject of grant funding. Many first-time 
entrepreneurs believe the initial order of business is to get a grant. Obviously, 
entrepreneurs need to pay bills and have to eat, and product development 
requires capital. All this makes it necessary to spend some time writing a good 
proposal, then submit it, and hopefully impress a panel of experts enough to 
receive some money. This tides over the startup team for the early months 
while they labor in their lab on a better mousetrap. This is the mainstream view 
under which most people operate, because most have never started a business 
and see this adventure through the lens of the employee. Nobody would show 
up at their job if they were not paid, so why should the entrepreneur? A result 
of this thinking is that first-time entrepreneurs are often more concerned 
about paying for their health insurance than market-testing their product.

Chapter 11 | Startup Grants:Can Government Programs Stimulate  
   Entrepreneurship?
120
This, unfortunately, is exactly the wrong approach to entrepreneurship. A fun-
damental misunderstand about funding and its usefulness lies at the heart of it. 
Startups need funding only when they have a validated product, ready to launch 
in the market. This is possible only when they have proof that enough people 
need this product and are ready and willing to pay for it—after they have 
repeatedly tested their ideas directly in the market, confirmed their approach 
and business model, and have done much soul-searching about whether they 
have the willpower to see their startup through. When a startup stands ready 
to launch a validated product, that’s when raising funds makes sense. The 
investment is necessary to scale up the startup and help produce its final 
product. Any money collected before then dilutes the focus of the startup and 
sets it off on the wrong trajectory.
Launching a startup has little to do with asking for permission from a panel or 
with sitting quietly at a desk, writing proposals and business plans. True game 
changers often go against the grain of what the mainstream accepts as normal 
and useful. How often have you read the story of a first-time author who sent 
a new book to 100 publishers who all thought it was not worth the paper 
it was printed on? The 101st publisher relented and accidentally ended up 
making a fortune when the book turned out to be an international bestseller. 
Similar stories abound, and it is the same with disruptive startups. They will 
never receive grant funding, and the public will rarely deem them worthwhile 
until they have launched and proven that their product or service is something 
that nobody is willing to live without.
Early Funding Can Be an Early Grave
In my opinion, early funding can be an early grave for a startup. It avoids all 
the inconvenient questions that build a foundation for success down the road. 
Startup founders should not ask themselves, “Where can I get $50,000?” but 
“Do I really need $50,000?” When the government makes startup grants avail-
able, this question is bypassed and drowned in months of concentrated grant-
proposal and business-plan writing. This happens at universities that funnel 
their startups into the grant pipeline. Theoretical planning and scrambling for 
funding replace firsthand experience in the market. The startup must have an 
entrepreneurial fire that puts everything else in second place. If this is absent, 
then it will be very difficult to compete with those who have that fire burning 
in them, despite any amount of funding.
Grants make sense much later, after the entrepreneurs have undergone some 
soul-searching and idea testing and have launched a prototype of their product 
or service. Additional capital may even be unnecessary at that point, if the 
venture is already profitable or has found a joint venture partner.

University Startups and Spin-Offs
121
During the initial unfunded startup stage, some founders learn that they lack 
what it takes to be a startup entrepreneur—they fail to launch a valuable 
product or stop much earlier than that. A grant would have just delayed the 
inevitable and would have wasted taxpayer money.
Network Effects and Other Government 
Programs
There are obviously ways in which a government can assist startups, other than 
grant funding. Undoubtedly, entrepreneurship benefits from network effects: 
if there are 20 other startups nearby, a new one benefits form existing infra-
structure; support services such as lawyers and patent specialists; inexpensive 
co-work spaces; and other positive externalities. Such a setup depends on the 
entrepreneurial climate and the ease of conducting business in a country.
Government policy can help lower the boundary to entry for new startups 
by making incorporation simple and straightforward. The less bureaucracy 
and the fewer roadblocks exist, the better. The environment may even attract 
entrepreneurs from abroad. At this point, an entrepreneurial ecosystem may 
be in the making, from which additional network effects originate. The first 
step of introducing or removing a certain government policy may seem insig-
nificant, but when it starts to take effect, change can occur rapidly.
Unfortunately, governments hardly have the best reputation for helping start-
ups succeed. Author Josh Lerner lists the following examples of government 
policies that were meant to boost entrepreneurship but that went wrong1:
When hurriedly rolling out the Small Business Investment 
•

Money Cannot Buy Entrepreneurship
Grant funding is a great idea in theory, and it made some sense when it was 
much more expensive to start a company. With today’s advances in IT and 
rapid prototyping, entrepreneurs can test their assumptions much more 
quickly without spending $50,000, $10,000, or even $5,000. This applies not 
just to Internet startups, but to any other project as well. Once they have 
proof that the market is ready to pay money for the technology, the startup is 
already up and running. If the market has no interest in a product, then there 
is no business, and the entrepreneurs have to decide whether they want to go 
back to the drawing board or abandon their venture. Money will hardly help 
entrepreneurs come up with fantastic new ideas, but internal drive will. Taking 
months to write business plans and grant proposals is time spent unwisely. It 
will chip away at the internal drive of otherwise motivated entrepreneurs.
When entrepreneurs are pushed down the grant track, they get the wrong 
impression of what startup entrepreneurship entails. As in a feudal society, this 
approach makes it seem as though entrepreneurship is an exercise in sending 
a proposal to an all-knowing entity who gives it the thumbs-up or -down. If 
the gatekeepers like what they see, startups may proceed. Otherwise, their 
ideas need further research. This is more akin to school than the reality of 
launching a company.
Furthermore, the silliest-sounding ideas are often the best ones. Those ideas 
are like the book that fell through 100 times before it became a bestseller. 
They have the power to become blockbusters, not the ones that everyone 
agrees on. Entrepreneurship is about taking matters into your own hands and 
staking a claim, regardless of what a bureaucrat or professor thinks.
Grants Crowd Out Investors and Advisors
At the 21st Singapore Economic Roundtable, organized by the Institute 
of Policy Studies and The Business Times in 2014, an angel investor raised 
the issue that grant funding made it harder for angel investors to invest in 
startups. He also argued that early support from the government enabled 

University Startups and Spin-Offs

less-innovative companies to survive.2 This investor brought up an issue 
that many others were aware of but hesitated to mention in the open. And 
its relevance is not limited to Singapore. The revolving door from incubator 
to incubator has created a situation where startups rely on the government 
to cover their overhead without coming up with innovative products.
Authors Paul Miller and Kirsten Bound make a comparable point: they suggest 
that startup accelerators may be more attractive for B-grade companies. In 
their opinion, if a business finds an accelerator or incubator attractive, it prob-
ably will be less successful than a company that does not need support.3
When startup entrepreneurs land early government grant funding, all their 
problems seem to have come to an end. They often stop seeking advice and 
keep working on their challenges with the logic they have always applied. 
Working with investors with extensive startup experience is the better choice. 
Their support goes beyond money and includes advice from seasoned experts 
in the field. This is useful, especially when things are not going smoothly; as the 
saying goes, “It’s too late to make friends when you need them.” Startups can 
benefit greatly from having experienced investors or entrepreneurs on their 
side, but they get crowded out by easily accessible grants.
But Startups Need Funding, Right? 
How can we fund all these university startups, if not through grants? As already 
mentioned, funding makes sense only when a startup is ready to hit the mar-
ket with a validated product. If the bar was higher for startups to collect grant 
money, much less of it would be necessary. Talented students and research-
ers would launch products and attract joint venture partners, and those with 
weak motivation to get their ventures off the ground would give up before 
they qualified for grants. Still, many startups collect grants as the first order of 
business, because such funding is often extremely easy to get.
Let’s look at exactly what is being funded with all this government grant money. 
Is it groundbreaking technology that needs a large investment to get off the 
ground? Is it a drug with the potential to save millions of lives that requires 
expensive trials to get to market? Or a special device aimed at improving living 
conditions in developing countries that can only be produced inexpensively 
in huge amounts? None of the above. The lion’s share of grant money goes 
toward the high salaries of startup entrepreneurs and the bills of external 
advisors and specialists. Conversely, high salaries and reliance on external spe-
cialists are outrages for private investors. When a startup raises seed-round

funding in Silicon Valley, the salaries for the entrepreneurs should be zero or 
low; and they must be able to do the core work in-house, because they are 
the brains behind the operation. If entrepreneurs cannot do with little money, 
how can they reign in the finances of their startup?
I know an entrepreneur who received a grant of about $200,000 for his soft-
ware startup. As they always do, the grant came with strings attached: for 
example, how much of the grant could be paid in salary to the founders. The 
entrepreneur’s first and foremost concern was how to double his salary allot-
ment through subterfuge. The next step was finding a foreign contractor who 
would do all the work for the remaining amount of the capital. Did taxpayers 
fund innovation with this grant? It all went toward someone’s salary and a 
foreign programming firm. The product was derivative and untested in the 
marketplace, and it has not yet seen the light of day.
Sadly, early grant funding props up businesses that have not undergone a single 
test in the market. In most cases, considerable money and time are spent 
building a better mousetrap, only to find out that the market is largely oblivi-
ous to the expensive prototype. Taxpayers should see their money put to 
better use.
The issue is that researchers often approach startup entrepreneurship as an 
afterthought. This may be because they are unaware that a startup is an avail-
able choice early in their career. Or it may be that when their research project 
ends, they scramble for a way to stay on board and stumble on the possibility 
of a startup, which then becomes their lifesaver to stay at the university a little 
longer. Whatever the case, the motivation to become an entrepreneur should 
never be entitlement or complacency, but an unquenchable drive and desire 
to make an impact in the world with your ideas. If this is the case, then you will 
find a way to begin the startup process in your free time while still being on 
salary with the university, so no further capital is necessary. You can also lever-
age your research work and infrastructure directly into the startup, removing 
overhead costs for offices, a workshop, and materials. If your technology is 
patentable, then take advantage of the university’s invention-disclosure pro-
cess to pay for the patent. If you need a certain person’s expertise, try to get 
them on your startup team as a co-founder. Before you know it, your startup 
costs will be close to zero. This is the true power of a university as a launch 
pad, not the availability of easy government grants. Make do with less. Recycle 
and leverage, instead of turning on the faucet and trying to fill a bucket that 
is full of holes.

C H A P T E R 
Venture Capital 
and Angel 
Investors
Students and researchers often misunderstand the function of investors, even 
if they have a business or finance background; they see them as a source of 
capital only. Entrepreneurs should consider investors in broader terms than 
that. Expertise, network, and influence are much more important than paying 
the next round of salaries. This chapter explains the most common sources 
of early-stage capital: venture capital firms and angel investors. It describes 
which other benefits these investors may have for startups and at what stage 
of development entrepreneurs should approach them (hint: much later than 
most people think).
Venture Capital
Venture capital is funding invested in startups and small companies with the goal 
of long-term capital appreciation. It bears high risk, but the promise of large 
returns in the future compensates for the possibility of total loss. When a ven-
ture capital firm invests in a startup, this often entails more than just money. 
Because venture capitalists (VCs) often have an entrepreneurial background 
themselves, they can provide worthwhile advice to startups—for example, 
about how to negotiate partnerships or how to scale the business when it 
achieves certain milestones. Strong networks with well-connected law firms 
and investment bankers add to the lure of venture capital.

Chapter 12 | Venture Capital and Angel Investors
126
This model of investment is nothing new. In fact, it has been around since the 
end of the World War II. In 1946, the first two venture capital firms were 
founded in America.1 Yet it was not until the first dot.com boom in the 1990s 
that VCs made a foray into mainstream consciousness. Venture capital sounds 
very good in theory. But when I speak to startups with venture funding, a 
slightly different picture emerges. I often get the impression that there are 
two kinds of startups: those that desperately want venture capital, and those 
that want to get out of the deal they have with a venture capitalist. Let’s dis-
cuss this in a little more detail.
Venture capital firms often visit universities to look for technology and early-
stage startups to invest in. More often than not, they leave without writing a 
check. This is largely because VCs look for low-hanging fruit: investible start-
ups with capable management teams and promise in attractive markets, in 
which they can buy equity relatively inexpensively. Most university startups are 
too early stage for VCs. They lack business models and financial models, and 
often they are still unsure themselves what exactly they will do and whether 
they even want to do it. Venture capital firms look for a relatively painless 10X 
return. Unless your company can make a credible case that high returns are 
on the horizon, VC funding will go elsewhere.
Students and researchers should understand what venture capitalists are 
looking for. Then they will be less disappointed when the next one turns up 
and leaves without investing. Startups can save a lot of time if they learn to 
first develop their businesses ideas without any outside funding. Then all the 
VC visits could take place later, when their contribution makes sense.
Venture capital is a fantastic tool when a startup company already has a proven 
business model and a product the market wants. Capital then serves as an 
accelerator to expand the business and help it grow rapidly. The goal of this 
expansion is achieving higher revenue in the market, which results in a higher 
value of the company and a higher payoff for the invested capital. The Holy 
Grail is an initial public offering (IPO), where VCs can sell their shares to the 
public with a high multiple. This is the ideal scenario. But unfortunately, things 
seldom turn out this way in the real world. When the business underperforms 
or the founders have no desire to go down the path the venture capitalist 
suggests, problems begin. The once-friendly VC turns into a micromanaging 
control freak. More often than not, the original founders lose control of their 
own company, and the venture capital firm installs a new CEO at the helm.
Contrary to public opinion, venture capitalists rarely invest their own money. 
Just like any other investment fund, they raise capital from private high-net-
worth individuals (HNWIs) and institutional investors. A venture capitalist

Harvard Business School Press, 2008).

University Startups and Spin-Offs
127
with a sound track record can raise several hundred million dollars this way, 
which the VC then divides over several portfolio investments. The few block-
busters in the portfolio more than compensate for the failed investments, 
or so the story goes. In the tech boom running up to 2000, venture activity 
increased at a pace that was unsustainable. Institutional and individual inves-
tors—attracted by the returns enjoyed by venture funds—poured money 
into the industry at unprecedented rates. Many venture capitalist firms stag-
gered under the weight of capital. As always happens in boom times, groups 
that should have not raised capital garnered considerable funds.2 We all know 
how it ended. After the boom came doom and many paper millionaires ended 
up with nothing.
The media only reports about the big winners in the venture game—the 
Googles, Facebooks, and Tesla Motors. This has imbued startup founders with 
the Hollywood version of venture capital. In reality, many small and medium 
funds implode and result in a total loss of investment. Successful portfolio 
companies usually go public with huge returns, so calculating a meaningful 
average return on investment (ROI) in venture capital funds is biased toward 
these rare blockbusters.
Looking at the actual numbers, venture capital returns have been less than 
stellar in the last decade. With selection-bias correction, the mean log return 
of venture capital during the first dot.com boom has been found to be about 
7% with a -2% intercept and a standard deviation of close to 100%.3 This and 
the fact that some entrepreneurs have expressed frustration with the man-
agement style of their venture capital firms have earned them the unflattering 
nickname “vulture capitalists.”
Angel Investors
Angel investors have the reputation of being the better VCs: less greedy; less 
complicated when it comes to due diligence, deal terms, and checking on 
progress; and altogether more willing to open their wallets. In contrast to 
venture capitalists, they invest their own money in startups: usually smaller 
sums, around $50,000 for a seed investment. Some successful entrepreneurs 
become angels after they sold their first company. Celebrities may become 
angels. Wealthy local business people may become angels. They often do this 
to remain connected with young entrepreneurs for image or networking

­purposes. Some also invest purely for the fun of it so they get to coach startups 
and help them avoid rookie mistakes. Angels would love to see a profit on 
their investment, but a large part of angel investing is giving back to society. 
Conversely, venture capital investing always aims at a financial payoff.
The link between angel networks and universities is weak. This may have 
something to do with the fact that university startups usually operate behind 
closed doors. Often they only enter the public light after they have collected 
grant funding. Because government grants are competing with seed invest-
ments, angels are being crowded out of the university startup game.4 This 
is not the situation with independent startups, and angel investing thrives in 
innovation hubs all around the world. Angels are often very engaged with the 
startups they invest in. If they have relevant experience, they can be valuable, 
trusted advisors in the early and later stages of a company.
Most recipients of angel capital are first-time entrepreneurs with no proven 
track record. They have exhausted the FFF round (capital from friends, family, 
and fools), but the project is still too small to be interesting to venture capi-
talists. Tech hubs in the United States, such as San Francisco and Austin, have 
large angel networks that entrepreneurs can tap into to get a small amount 
of cash to start. Smaller angel networks are sprouting up all around the globe. 
This is an alternative to grant funding: less bureaucratic and with less time 
between the first meeting and the investment.
However, just as grant funding gives a false impression of what entrepreneur-
ship is all about, so does early angel and venture capital. When you have raised 
your first investment round, it will look to the outside world as if you have 
already made it. This is a cool feeling, no doubt. But reality will catch up with 
you, because the funding removes constraints from your startup. Constraints 
on both time and capital (human and financial) are the lifeblood of innovation. 
They focus entrepreneurs on profitability early on and cut out all the fluff that 
is contributing little to the creation of a sustainable business. If you cannot 
achieve some level of profitability on your own without external funding, you 
may have to shut down the business and move on to the next idea. It’s often 
as simple as that.
In a nutshell, entrepreneurs have to reach “Ramen profitability” before start-
ing to fret about raising any outside capital. It is more comfortable to have 
funding than to work in a garage on a shoestring. But much more time will 
be available for the founders to work on their idea if they forget about rais-
ing capital. Dealing with a micromanaging investor can be a nightmare. Many 
profitable businesses you never heard of have been built without any funding.

When you are just starting out on your entrepreneurial journey, stop thinking 
about venture and angel capital. Begin building a prototype today, and you will 
be in good company.
The Fallacy of Failing Fast
“Failing fast” is a paradigm loosely associated with the Lean Startup method.5 
I mention this here with venture capital and angel investment because you 
should have some reservations before wholeheartedly embracing the notion 
of failing fast. They are related to the fact that a failed startup is completely at 
odds with the expectations of investors.
The idea that entrepreneurs learn just as much from failures as from suc-
cesses is nothing new. Failing fast stipulates that the sooner entrepreneurs 
get business failures under their belt, the better. This will lead to faster learn-
ing and better entrepreneurship in the future, so the reasoning goes. I can 
second this, because my failures have always yielded bigger lessons than my 
successes. Still, there exists a fundamental misunderstanding regarding failing 
fast. Embraced by a prominent Stanford professor in her creativity class, failing 
fast has become a means to justify when a startup has gone belly-up after its 
fleeting life. “Celebrate your failures, and move on to the next idea,” is the way 
she puts it.6
The mindset of welcoming failure into your life is problematic. Suddenly, first-
time entrepreneurs are urged to fail, as a means for them to graduate on 
their journey. If things in a startup become difficult, the first reaction is to fold 
the venture and celebrate, writing it off as a learning experience. However, 
here’s something that I find to be an even better learning experience: pulling 
a startup from the brink and getting it back on track to turn a profit. This 
process may often be far from elegant, but investors prefer it any time. Folding 
a startup at the first sight of stormy weather may be fine in an in vitro school 
experiment, but the real world works differently.
For every investor in their right mind, failure is not an option. To frame the 
total loss of capital as collateral damage on the startup founder’s learning 
path is not OK. If entrepreneurs like to celebrate their failing experiences on 
their own dime, that’s fine. Unfortunately, all too often, investors or the tax 
payer end up paying the bill for the entrepreneur’s education. Personally, I am 
wondering how failing fast can help create a sustainable track record of suc-
cess and execution at universities. What looks like a failure at the beginning

Radically Successful Businesses (New York: Crown Business, 2011).

World (New York: HarperCollins, 2009).

Chapter 12 | Venture Capital and Angel Investors
130
occasionally ends up being a massive success, if the entrepreneur can weather 
the storm. But if failing fast is an available choice, entrepreneurs will never dig 
deep enough to eventually strike gold.
About half of my own projects went under, some of them with a bang. In one 
case, external capital suffered; but in most cases I hurt the most of all the 
participants involved. Pivoting the business model can sometimes help avert a 
calamity, but still, every time a project fails, I feel miserable.
When a failure occurs, you need to analyze it thoroughly. Once you under-
stand what happened, you can step up a notch to take measures and be sure 
it will not happen again. Lifelong learning to succeed is the goal, not looking 
for experiences to fail fast.
Investors and angels should screen diligently for the fail-fast mindset. As a 
founder, better avoid writing it on your flag that you are looking for oppor-
tunities to fail fast, just because you picked up the term in a startup book. 
When you become an entrepreneur, it is time to grow up. You need to use 
your creativity to pivot business and revenue models until they work, and 
never give up before you have tried everything to avert disaster. If you play 
with other people’s money, failure is not an option you can embrace under 
any circumstances—even if a professor from Stanford University tells you it’s 
OK to do so.

Incubators and 
Accelerators
Both incubators and accelerators provide startup aid in the form of advice 
and services. In comparison to venture capital firms, which focus on invest-
ment capital, incubators and accelerators house startups at their offices and 
are in daily contact with them about challenges at hand.
Both may have what they call an intake, which marks the term of a new batch 
of startups admitted to enter a program. These programs begin at certain 
times during the year, similar to university semesters. When a program has 
run its course, the startups are often shopped to first-round investors on a 
demo day.
Most people use the terms incubator and accelerator interchangeably, but there 
are some small distinctions between them. This chapter explores these modern 
forms of startup support and their usefulness for university entrepreneurs.
Incubators 
In contrast to research and technology parks, which provide business infra-
structure for established companies and government agencies, incubators 
firmly concentrate on companies in the startup stage. Many research and 
technology parks house incubation programs, but they are not incubators 
themselves. Incubators provide offices and other real estate, along with vari-
ous business support services, to fledgling companies in a wide variety of 
fields. Resources provided include help with business basics; networking activ-
ities; help with accounting and financial management; access to bank loans, 

Chapter 13 | Incubators and Accelerators
132
loan funds, and guarantee programs; links to strategic partners; access to angel 
investors or venture capital; advisory boards and mentors; intellectual prop-
erty management; and more.
As author Linda Knoop mentions, about one-third of business incubation pro-
grams are sponsored by economic development organizations. Government 
entities (such as cities or counties) account for 21% of program sponsors. 
Another 20% are sponsored by academic institutions, including two- and four-
year colleges, universities, and technical colleges. In the United States, most 
incubation programs are sponsored privately. About 25% of all incubation 
programs take equity in the companies they hatch. The others provide a ser-
vice as nonprofits that they hope will create jobs, improve the community’s 
entrepreneurial climate, or kick-start community revitalization.1
Unlike with many freely available business support programs, entrepreneurs 
who wish to enter a business incubation program must apply for admission. 
Acceptance criteria vary from program to program, but in general only those 
with feasible business ideas and a workable business plan may join.
Accelerators
Accelerators (also called seed accelerators) are comparable to incubators. A 
clear distinction between the two is seldom made, but you could say that 
accelerators are for-profit versions of incubators. They are also more com-
mon in the technology and software space. Authors Paul Miller and Kristen 
Bound identify the following criteria that distinguish accelerators from busi-
ness incubators: the application process is open to all and competitive, they 
give a pre-seed investment in exchange for equity, the focus is on small teams 
rather than individual founders, support is time-limited (around 90 days), and 
cohorts or classes of startups exist rather than individual companies.2 The 
business model of accelerators consists of producing venture-capital-style 
returns. The first seed accelerator was Y Combinator. Started in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, it moved to Silicon Valley in 2005. In short succession, Techstars, 
located in Boulder, Colorado, followed in 2007. Seedcamp, calling London its 
home, opened its doors in 2008. There are now many incubators in startup 
hubs around the world, some of them with billions of dollars of funding on 
the backend. New startup hubs are seeing an increasing number of privately 
funded accelerators pop up. The accelerator model seems to work not only 
for the accelerators themselves, but also for startup entrepreneurs.

One of the most established seed accelerators, Y Combinator, had an accep-
tance rate of around 2% in 2012.3 The primary value for the entrepreneur 
consists of world-class mentoring, connections, and the recognition of being 
part of the accelerator. Gaining access to a high-powered network of entre-
preneurs consisting of Y Combinator alumni and the who’s who of the Silicon 
Valley billionaire club is clearly a huge advantage for startups. Famous examples 
out of Y Combinator include Dropbox and Airbnb.4 The accelerator likes to 
describe itself as a “new college for entrepreneurs.”5 Such seed accelerators 
can be a pre-filtering mechanism for later-stage funding.
There may be an incubator or accelerator in your city. Someone from an accel-
erator may even have reached out to you and wants to find out whether you 
would consider joining them. Should you? Here are some things to consider.
Shortcomings of Accelerators
It is important to remember that accelerator programs are not free govern-
ment programs, but for-profit operations that need to produce a return with 
the startups they seed. Prominent venture capital firms often fund them with 
massive backing. They are mostly focused on software and technology start-
ups, and technology firms may support these programs because they see addi-
tional business for the startups using their technology. Facebook, for example, 
ran its own accelerator for a while to encourage startups to use its platform.
Because startup costs for software companies have shrunk in the past decade, 
with prices for server space and computing power rapidly racing to the bot-
tom, software startups can be lifted off the ground with small investments. 
This is where accelerators shine. However, programs geared toward hardware 
startups—for example, in the field of robotics, material science, or transport 
technology—are relatively rare. If you are a tech startup, great; accelerators 
cater to your needs. But if you are a hardware startup, an accelerator may not 
work for you.

There are a few criticisms of accelerators, as Miller and Bound point out, both 
for the startups they seed and the investors who fund the programs6:
They focus on smaller companies. It is highly unlikely that 
• 
an accelerator could help build a Facebook or a Google. 
They concentrate on companies that already have a busi-
ness model and that a bigger fish can buy soon after 
launch. Only then will the 10X or 100X gain the accel-
erator is looking for become reality.
Useful companies may fail after accelerator programs. 
• 
Because the program’s support is brief, companies still 
have much to learn about how the actual market works. 
The hype around the accelerator program may dull their 
senses and lead to complacency about how hard it is to 
establish a successful business.
Startup founders may feel exploited. Some startup entre-
• 
preneurs have publicly expressed anger about “rich guys 
starting a startup accelerator so they can rip off found-
ers.”7 Some of the seed capital to startups exists in the 
form of loans that startups have to pay back—yet accel-
erators still demand an equity stake of around 7% in the 
company. This may be marginally acceptable when the 
value of the alumni network is significant and the accel-
erator’s support is large. But if an inexperienced group 
has started an accelerator as a profit center, then the 
practice of demanding a high equity share for a small loan 
is questionable.
Accelerators have a reputation for being more attractive 
• 
for B-grade companies. This point is up for debate, but 
it can be argued that if a business finds an accelerator 
or incubator attractive, it probably will be less profitable 
than a company that needs no support.
Accelerators are creating bubbles. Although many small 
• 
companies are bought each year, the market for acquisi-
tions is still only in the hundreds. If many more accelera-
tors pop up and begin turning out new companies in the 
thousands, then a crisis of confidence in the sector may 
develop, because most of the new companies will go under. 
Accelerators subscribe to a “spray and pray” approach to

investing, where they make many small investments in the 
hopes that the tide will lift all boats. Some investors have 
the opinion that targeted investments would be a better 
and more sustainable use of investors’ money.
Accelerators are just startup schools. Some see accel-
• 
erators simply as a reaction to the defects of the univer-
sity system in creating sustainable businesses out of their 
research. They doubt the benefit to the investors whose 
money is invested in the startups, because many found-
ers see the accelerator track as an experience worth 
mentioning in their CV more than a serious try at build-
ing a business. This may undermine the ecosystem of 
accelerators in the long run, when sustainable success 
stories dry up.
Here is another damper for you: 93% of companies backed by Y Combinator 
fail, despite the best efforts of the accelerator and the entrepreneurs them-
selves.8 The venture capital model focuses mainly on quick-turnaround equity 
funding. Scalability with the potential to monetize 100 million users rela-
tively soon is also one of the cornerstones of tech accelerators. It is unclear 
whether this model makes sense for smaller-scale startups that need longer-
term development, or for startups in non-tech fields.
Long story short: the incubator and accelerator model is promising. For tech 
startups, it is an alternative to going it alone. The alumni and founder networks 
of some accelerators are excellent and can help build synergies for founders 
early on. However, not all accelerators are created equal. The superstars may 
be valuable to their portfolio companies, but there are many second- and 
third-tier accelerators. These may have limited benefits for entrepreneurs past 
the usual advice and a little funding, in exchange for a large chunk of equity.
Can Universities Benefit from Accelerators? 
Unless accelerators have a proven track record of success with strong net-
works that can provide real value, they may add little to what the university as 
a platform already has to offer its startups. Universities have many synergies 
available, most of which currently evaporate, unused. It is a matter of reactivat-
ing them and directing them toward adding value to the university’s startups. I 
address approaches to achieve this in the second part of this book.

As soon as accelerators have expanded their focus to sectors outside of tech, 
they may become interesting platforms for startup founders from university 
research labs. In either case, startup entrepreneurs should never rely on some-
one else to carry out their work. First and foremost, they need drive and an 
open mind. They need the right presentation and communication skills with 
which they can actively seek out synergies and potential industry partners to 
give them feedback about their processes and minimum viable products. As 
soon as they know how to develop their value propositions, engage third par-
ties, and move interactions forward with goal-oriented next steps, they can 
begin building their own networks on the platform of the university. With the 
right mindset, a strong startup environment can add a lot of value. Without it, 
even the perfect ecosystem will only make a small difference.

Moving Past  
the Startup 
Stage
The prospect of having to micromanage their company’s taxes, accounting, 
payroll, and sales calls and handle all the other unpleasant byproducts of entre-
preneurship is often a turnoff for students and researchers. Whether they are 
good multitaskers is another question. A world-class entrepreneur should not 
waste time filling out a tax return that an accountant could complete for $100. 
But to reach the point that you can delegate all the support tasks, you need 
to understand what it takes. The first stages of entrepreneurship are yours 
and yours alone. Doing everything in the beginning does not mean things will 
always be that way. It is important to realize that your venture will graduate 
from bootstrapping and MVP testing mode at some point. In order to be a 
business, it must eventually launch a final product and take off.
I have discussed the most important three analytical tools in your startup 
toolkit: the lean canvas, the financial model, and the one-page proposal. You 
have learned many approaches that can help you leave the building and get real 
feedback about your product. You know how to incrementally develop prod-
ucts the market wants, using “build, measure, learn.” And you have become 
acquainted with several techniques to engage others with next steps and 
improve communications so they see a benefit in what you offer. Your startup 
may be in MVP testing mode or may have launched products. You may be 
bootstrapping, or you may have made sales. In any case, you have taken the 
first steps and are now an entrepreneur. That’s the most important thing, and

I applaud you for following through. You cannot skip the first stages of startup 
entrepreneurship discussed in this book so far. They lay the foundation for 
everything that follows.
After being a startup entrepreneur for a while, you understand what it takes. 
There will be a time when you are ready to pull the trigger and move past 
the startup stage. Then you can decide if you want to continue running the 
business yourself. Perhaps you have found your entrepreneurial stride and 
are fully comfortable managing your company from here forward. This is an 
exciting endeavor, and when your startup has taken off, the hardest part is 
often behind you.
Alternatively, you may begin to look for synergies from the outside. Once 
you have tested various MVPs and confirmed your value and your growth 
hypotheses, you have armed yourself with enough knowledge to engage a 
joint venture partner or raise capital from a venture capital firm. If you do, you 
will no longer be responsible for everything and will integrate an established 
company in your operations. This is a viable option that could help you tap 
into a larger network and scale your operations.
The legalities of entering a joint venture deal or signing a term sheet with a 
venture capital firm are complex, and other sources discuss them at length. 
This chapter gives you an overview of what to expect when going down 
either path.
Seeking a Joint Venture
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and multinational companies may 
approach universities for collaborations with research projects. These collab-
orations are often limited, with a knowledge transfer in favor of the company. 
Because most universities are far from being startup hubs, companies cannot 
be blamed for that. Startups that currently launch out of universities have 
little traction in the market and little conviction about their business models 
and future direction. Naturally, they cannot make many demands on industrial 
partners. As a result, they frame discussions with established companies not 
as being about real joint ventures between startups and industry, but rather as 
being about sponsored research partnerships.
R&D can be costly for companies, but by sponsoring research teams and 
tapping the knowledge of a university, they can save millions of dollars. 
With more and more university startups on the horizon, the focus of such 
partnerships is beginning to shift. Students and researchers have more strat-
egies available to develop products that satisfy a genuine need in the market. 
When market testing shows that enough people are willing to pay for their 
products, university startups are standing on stronger footing. They are viable  
companies, often with existing revenue and a sizable present value. This opens the 

University Startups and Spin-Offs
139
gateway to an entirely new value proposition: instead of a collaboration between a 
company and a university research team, a joint venture is a collaboration between 
two companies. The expectation is a two-way knowledge exchange where the 
startup entrepreneurs learn as much about doing business as the joint venture 
partner learns about technology—a win-win situation for both parties. University 
startups should begin to lead the discussion in this different light.
Unless someone on your team is a natural born manager, I recommend you 
look for a joint venture partner around the time when you are ready to launch 
your final product. There is of course no surefire way to land the joint venture 
of your dreams. The only certain thing is that the collaboration should benefit 
both parties. After you have validated your value and growth hypotheses, you 
will be in a good position to approach potential joint venture partners. You 
may already be in contact with companies that service the same market as 
you. Investigate whether they can bring synergies to your venture: scale, better 
distribution, or access to better manufacturing technology. At the same time, 
the feedback from your MVP tests, along with your financial model, should make 
the case that your company is a decent business worth considering as an invest-
ment. You may still have no revenue, but if your final product and outlook are a 
match for them, joint venture partners may want to collaborate with you.
You will rarely convince a joint venture partner with numbers and logic alone. 
Chemistry and mutual trust are often more important than anything else. 
Unless your company already makes millions of dollars a year, you should 
look for a joint venture partner who likes and appreciates your team, your 
history, and your effort. If you have developed a product with MVP testing and 
have validated your hypotheses, this entrepreneurial achievement may be the 
deciding factor that causes a company to partner with your startup instead of 
another one that is still deliberating how to get started.
SMEs can be very good joint venture partners. The founders of these com-
panies are often still at the helm as CEO, so they may sympathize with young 
entrepreneurs who have made something out of nothing. Conversely, in a mul-
tinational, daily business is dictated by shareholder demands. In such top-down 
bureaucracies, the human factor is less prevalent; thus it may be more difficult 
to start a discussion with a partner who is a giant in a market.
Let’s say you identify a few potential joint venture partners. How do you approach 
them and open the discussion? As you may have guessed, you apply the same 
communication tools you used to get your startup off the ground. The world has 
not changed much in the meantime. Third parties still want to see the benefits 
of your product; they want to know how those benefits relate to solving their 
current challenges, and you must engage them with actionable next steps.
Show them the test results from your MVP testing and your incremental 
product development. Introduce the final product that you determined is 
desired by the market. Your lean canvas should summarize how this relates 

Chapter 14 | Moving Past the Startup Stage

to the potential joint venture partner. The assumptions behind your financial 
model will open the discussion about pricing and cost structure. Then move 
the discussion along with one-page proposals. This involves several steps, with 
the ultimate goal of selling shares of your startup to the joint venture partner 
and becoming part of their network.
A joint venture is simply an offer to another businessperson that they see as 
valuable. You should already have learned how to do that several times over 
in this book. The exact structure and terms of your joint venture is outside 
the scope of what we are discussing here. When you reach the point that 
negotiations and legal agreements enter the picture, I recommend you work 
with your lawyer.
Raising Venture Capital
I have previously talked about venture capitalists and how they can help your 
startup with capital and expertise. Although I said that early venture funding 
may be a disadvantage for a first-time entrepreneur, it can make sense when 
a company has developed far enough to launch a final product. This product 
should have solid, confirmed market demand. Revenues are therefore on the 
horizon. With this value proposition, your startup becomes interesting for a 
venture capital firm as an investment.
Before you sign the investment agreement with a VC, you should have a clear 
idea of what raising venture capital entails. Other books sufficiently explore 
the legal side of this. I will simply present an overview of the process of 
entering into business with an investment firm in case your startup chooses 
to go down that road. Note that this is a different proposition than passively 
meeting venture capitalists who approach your university. You will see later 
in this chapter that your active participation is paramount to identify the right 
venture capital firm.
Before reaching out to investors, develop a clear idea of what your company 
needs; only then can you scan the venture capital landscape and pick a firm 
that matches your vision. Do your own due diligence on these firms. There is 
a great variety out there, each with a distinct focus and track record. Study all 
the information you can find, and think about whether this firm can bring you 
value other than money alone. Firms that randomly approach your university 
most likely will not make that shortlist.

University Startups and Spin-Offs

Venture capitalists Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson give a good outline of the 
process of raising venture capital from the perspective of startup entrepre-
neurs.1 Their recommendations include some the points explained in the rest 
of this chapter.
Determine the Amount of Capital You Need
The amount of capital you need tells you which venture capital firms to 
approach. VCs specialize in terms of the stage they fund. A firm focused on 
later-stage funding will hardly consider a startup that incorporated yesterday, 
just as an early-stage fund will not invest in a company that aims to raise 
funds pre-IPO. A smaller firm or angel investor may seed amounts up to 
$500,000. If your startup is raising $10 million, then a larger VC firm will be 
a better partner. 
Have a clear idea of the number you are aiming for. Never offer a range of, 
say, $4 million to $6 million. You must know whether you need $4 million or  
$6 million. Instead of letting the other party figure out what is best for you, 
work it out for yourself, and then confidently ask for it.
Have Your Fundraising Materials Ready
The materials you need include the following:
Executive summary, compiled with the saying “less is 
• 
more” in mind. Fit as much information as you pos-
sibly can on one page. Avoid any fluff. Fancy design is 
unnecessary.
PowerPoint presentation in 10/20/30 format.
• 
Elevator pitch with your micro-scripts.
• 
Lean canvas. You may have several, according to different 
• 
scenarios.
Financial model. As I said before, more important than 
• 
impressive numbers are the underlying assumptions of 
your financial model. Be able to explain how you arrived 
at the numbers in your model.

Capitalist (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2011).

Chapter 14 | Moving Past the Startup Stage 
142
Demo or prototype. This may be more important than 
• 
all the other documents together. Even if it is still in early 
development, a demo shows the VC what you are working 
on. If you already have your final product, then bring that. 
If it is too big, bring a video, or invite the VC to your lab. 
Having a prototype available shows that you are serious 
with your startup and ready to move to the next stage. 
Due-diligence materials. When a venture capital firm is 
• 
ready to sign a term sheet with you, it will ask for capi-
talization tables (how the shares of your company are 
distributed), contracts and material agreements, employ-
ment agreements, licensing agreements, board meeting 
minutes, and so on. You do not need them in the first 
meeting with a VC. Regardless, make it a point to assem-
ble these materials early so you can easily access them 
when needed. You should never hide anything unpleasant, 
such as a current dispute or similar issues. It is better to 
bring those up right away and be clear in the future.
Despite what anyone else may advise, forget about writing a business plan. 
Most VCs have not read one in years. The same goes for what is called a  
private placement memorandum (PPC). This is necessary only when your 
negotiations have progressed significantly. Bringing one with you to the first 
meeting is overkill and will only raise red flags. A venture capitalist will most 
likely ask you to e-mail something first, so make sure your documents are 
light enough to be attachments. 
Finding the Right VC
Hopefully by now you have a sizable network of fellow entrepreneurs in your 
city and beyond. Ask them about their experiences with VCs and which ones 
they recommend. It is much more powerful to be introduced by another 
entrepreneur who already knows the venture capital firm than to cold-call 
them. A good VC firm receives thousands of submissions per year. You need 
to cut through the clutter any way you can, and personal introductions go a 
long way.
Research the different firms on the Internet. Carefully study which other 
companies they have invested in. Examine their track record. Google whether 
there are any lawsuits against this venture capital firm or any of its partners. 
Just as VCs investigate your startup, you have the right to know what they are 
doing. Ask for a list of entrepreneurs the VC has worked with and startups it 
has funded. Call some of those startups and ask what their relationship with 
the venture firm was like. The best VCs will give you this list. If not, feel free 
to ask. If a firm balks at providing references, then ask yourself whether you 
want to work with an nontransparent partner.

As mentioned before, most VC firms will not sign an NDA with you. This is 
less alarming than it may seem. Reputable venture capitalists are busy and have 
no time to steal your ideas. You should have weeded out untrustworthy firms 
long ago with your own due diligence.
Of course, a meeting with a venture capital firm is no guarantee that it will 
invest in you. Even after prolonged due diligence, the firm may pass on the 
deal. This can happen directly or indirectly, when the VC simply stops return-
ing your e-mails. If a firm turns you down, you should try to find out what 
happened and why it chose not to invest. This information is important for 
your path ahead. Persistently probe until you find out.
If everything goes well and both the VC and you feel that working together is 
in your mutual interest, a deal will come to pass. This stage is often split into 
two separate activities. Part one is signing the so-called term sheet, a document 
that outlines the final deal structure. As Feld and Mendelson explain, the most 
important aspects of the term sheet are economics and control. Economics 
relates to how the venture capital firm will share in profits, through either a 
sale of the company or an initial public offering (IPO). Control refers to how 
the VC can influence the direction of the company either directly or by veto-
ing certain decisions of the CEO.
Without going into more detail about joint ventures or raising venture 
capital, your startup is well on its way when you have reached this stage. 
Serious contact with established companies or investors will seldom take 
place early in the life of your startup. As you have seen, you must have vali-
dated assumptions about your product and your market before you can move 
on. You should have a clear picture of your business model and what your 
startup can provide to others. And, most important, you must have explored 
whether entrepreneurship is for you. As much as you may want to, these 
steps cannot be skipped. They are necessary to build a strong foundation for 
your startup.

Strategies for 
Universities 
Congratulations—you made it through the first part of this book. Maybe you 
are an entrepreneur, or perhaps you think about how your university could 
enable more startup success. Either way, you have seen by now what it means 
to launch a company out of a university. It may have surprised you that little 
theory is necessary for that purpose. That a startup has more to do with 
tinkering and incremental product development than careful grant-proposal 
writing may also have been news to you. With a fresh approach to commu-
nicate ideas, startups engage third parties with actionable next steps to build 
on synergies for their success. The most important part of the process is to 
begin and to collect individual experiences and feedback as soon as possible.
Just as launching a startup has a great deal to do with experimentation, so 
does setting up a startup track at a university. Think about the process of 
building the entrepreneurship program at your university as a startup in itself. 
You will need the very same skills to make it work.
Universities are magnets for smart people. Traditionally, they have educated 
students in specialized domains and critical thinking. However, graduates and 
researchers often struggle to apply their knowledge in their first job in the 
real world. All the way up to the doctorate level, they have acquired deep 
theoretical knowledge that makes them stand out. Entrepreneurial experience 
in their own startups can greatly improve their skill sets. In light of stricter 
requirements in the job market today, universities may want to think about 
extending their role. They can prepare graduates with the full spectrum of 
skills that help them become more successful, both in the workforce and in 
their own companies. Establishing a stronger foundation for entrepreneurship 
is an effective way to do so. The most important building blocks exist already; 
they are just waiting to be assembled.

P A R T  

Universities enjoy a privileged position. Governments, businesses, and other 
organizations love to collaborate with them, either on research projects or 
via in-house R&D. Academia provides a walled garden for acquiring knowl-
edge and going about your affairs undisturbed. This safe-haven function should 
extend to launching startups as well. Building a bridge to the market and 
people outside of academia will expand the reach of university research. The 
motivation for launching a startup out of a university should be the desire to 
make a measurable impact on peoples’ lives. Through the mechanism of the 
market, this is possible. It will allow promising technology to influence the lives 
of people where it matters most. Giving you a better understanding of what 
it takes to access this mechanism is the goal of this book.
To quote Peter Drucker, this means “if you want something new, you have 
to stop doing something old.” There will be setbacks along the way. Experts 
inside and outside of your university will tell you with considerable authority 
how you should set up your startup program. Some people may fear for their 
jobs. Others may feel threatened by the new wind that is suddenly blowing 
through the institution. Much confusion will ensue, and staying the course will 
require strong conviction. With persistence, you will eventually uncover an 
individual setup that works for your university. Set out on the path to find 
what works best for you with the mindset of an entrepreneur.
In the long run, universities need to integrate entrepreneurship one way or 
another. It will no longer suffice to try to launch startups. Success must be 
measurable. When that time comes, it will be too late for some institutions, 
and they will miss the boat. If this is not the fate you have in mind for your 
university, then please read on. The suggestions in this part of the book may 
stimulate your thinking along the path of introducing entrepreneurship at 
both the degree level and the research level. Some of the things I suggest may 
already be in place at your university. Others may seem too simplistic, too 
cumbersome, impractical, unrealistic, or not feasible. Remember, this part of 
the book is a collection of thoughts to keep the dialogue going about univer-
sity entrepreneurship. There is no definitive answer of how to do it. One thing 
is certain, though: doing nothing will never enable more startup success.
Many universities already have some startups and talk about the numerous 
spin-offs that have launched out of their institution in the past. They may 
have an entrepreneurship class and refer to grant X and startup program 
Y, which is supported by the government. But how is the success of these 
­initiatives ­measured? By the number of students attending a specific program? 
By the number of startups collecting grant funding? Or by the number of 
startups registered as companies? Unfortunately, most of these metrics are 
vanity ­metrics. They may result in good-looking statistics, but the real impact 
disappoints. After all, does grant funding guarantee startup success? Of course 
not. Just wanting to be an entrepreneur hardly means you will have entrepre-
neurial success.

Despite their best efforts, most startups fail. Focusing on good-looking num-
bers may deliver satisfaction in the short run, but when attention shifts to the 
bottom line, things will get uncomfortable. How many customers have your 
startups reached? How much revenue have they earned in their first, second, 
and third year? I am not saying that universities and governments deliberately 
close their eyes to the real numbers behind their current startup support; but 
when it becomes common practice to show measurable impact, they will be 
forced to catch up fast.
Your university may have to achieve certain key performance indicators 
(KPIs), which is why you are reading this book. Or more researchers and 
students may be asking for advice for their startup ideas. Or it may interest 
you personally to make this complex property called entrepreneurship work. 
Just as in part 1, where we looked at strategies for startup entrepreneurs, 
part 2 collects approaches that have worked for other organizations when 
creating a favorable startup environment. These are not only universities, but 
also private organizations and corporations. When it comes to commercial-
izing innovation, the private sector has a leg up on universities. We’ll take a 
look at their playbook and see what we can borrow to power up university 
entrepreneurship.
As you may have guessed, the task of setting up a startup track and measuring 
its success hardly happens over night. If a change agent comes up with ideas 
that “break all the rules,” the people responsible for things running smoothly 
may put up a defense. To avoid such a fate, it is often best to avoid proclaim-
ing that you have all the answers. Prescribing sweeping reforms is the wrong 
way. Don’t be the bull in the china shop. An entrepreneurship program needs 
to grow incrementally, just like a startup. With this in mind, the Lean Startup 
method can be used to set up the program in phases. Think in terms of 
­minimum viable products: carry out a small change, test it, review it, and adapt 
it. Do this repeatedly, and you will achieve more than going for a home run 
right from the start.
Some of the ideas in the following chapters come from the world of ­venture 
capital, and some from corporate R&D. Universities use some of them today, 
whereas others are new to academia. Wherever you are on the path of 
­integrating more entrepreneurship in your institution, I encourage you to 
keep an open mind.
Should Universities Care About Startup Success?
Historically, most universities had little motivation to compete in the market, 
and by their own admission, they still are not all that interested in the com-
mercial success of their research. There is no urgency to change, at least in 
universities with access to ample state funding. Framing the startup debate 

purely in terms of money ignores the fact that more than profit encourages 
founders to launch companies. Real-world impact beyond academia is equally 
important for many entrepreneurs. If a technology can make a difference, it 
should be available as a product or service. If it has the potential to save lives, 
then even more so.
Academic research often addresses pressing issues of developing countries 
that are in desperate need of innovative solutions. However, when a PhD or 
postdoc program ends, research teams disband and their intellectual property 
evaporates. In the best case, the university has patented their technology and 
makes it available for licensing through the technology licensing office (TLO).  
Universities’ passive approach toward commercialization leaves it up to the 
private sector to find the proverbial needle in a haystack, so most academic 
research has a small impact and therefore no relevance to most people  
outside universities. Framing the discussion about startups purely in commer-
cial terms therefore misses the point.
When stepping off the well-trodden path, universities often fear that startup 
initiatives may pose a risk to the institutions’ good reputation if they fail. Will 
universities become the subject of ridicule if it turns out they promised too 
much with their entrepreneurship initiatives? Will their reputation suffer if they 
launch a startup program that fails to bring forth the next Mark Zuckerberg? 
To make matters worse, unexpected success brings its own problems, because 
high market returns can cannibalize a university’s government funding. The 
budget should show a deficit at the end of the year to justify an increase 
the next year. Massive startup success is therefore disruptive to those with 
an interest in preserving the status quo. At the same time, university KPIs 
are beginning to demand a certain number of startups to justify research 
funds spent, which puts universities in a bind. They must find a compromise 
between incorporating more entrepreneurship and keeping their funding 
from the ­public sector as high as possible. In any event, universities have a lot 
of catching up to do with their startup initiatives. They are becoming more 
open to advice on how to set up startup programs and incorporate more 
entrepreneurship into their operations.
The amount of money sunk into research at universities is staggering, with 
some annual university budgets in the billions of dollars. In Europe, universi-
ties have traditionally relied on state funding almost exclusively and have had a  
tendency to look down on commercial ideas and efforts to commercialize their 
technology themselves. But their American counterparts have a long ­history of 
seeking links to the private sector and their own successful alumni and are 
therefore more entrepreneurial, with a track record as startup hubs. Modern 
Asian campuses are also more open to commercializing their research and 
seeking a return on investment, but they often lack the flat, democratic struc-
ture and independent critical thinking that help startups achieve momentum. 

In addition, they are often more bureaucratic and risk-averse than other 
­universities, despite their stated goals of aiming for high-impact commercial-
ization and aggressive monetization of research. But again, their KPIs demand 
a certain number of startups or spin-off companies per year, so they need to 
satisfy their statistics one way or another.
It is important to reiterate that it is not the intention of this book to reform 
universities and the way they work now. I respect the current system and see 
its many benefits. Nevertheless, when presenting commercialization ideas to 
universities, I have heard statements like, “I think these are good ideas, but the 
board will never approve.” And, “The university is not a hedge fund.” As much 
as I understand these concerns, thinking about how university startups could 
launch in a better way is important. If more successful startups came out of 
universities, everyone would benefit. Their research can make a measurable 
impact on people’s lives, and the university can gain new network effects in 
addition to those it already enjoys. It is in the best interest of universities 
to care about their startups and take the necessary steps to improve their 
chances at success.

How Do 
Universities 
Measure the 
Impact of  Their 
Research?
University startups have existed for a while, but it has become easier in 
recent years for students and researchers to launch a company. Startup 
grants, entrepreneurship programs, a drastic decrease in the cost of IT tech-
nology, and rapid prototyping beckon researchers to take the plunge into 
startup life. Students and researchers are beginning to take advantage of lean 
methods. I applaud this trend and think it paves the way for a promising 
future. At present, however, the startup initiatives of most universities still 
amount to little measurable impact in the market. How much relevance does 
university research have outside academia? How many university startups 
launch products and achieve profitability in the real world? Universities rarely 
collect impact-driven metrics, and it is still the revenue from patent licensing 
that validates a technology as a commercial success.

Chapter 15 | How Do Universities Measure the Impact of  Their Research?

This overlooks a whole new breed of lean startups composed of fluid teams 
who never even think of patenting their ideas. Facebook launched out of a 
university dorm room but bypassed all existing infrastructure aimed at startup 
support. It licensed no technology, applied for no grant, and sought no permis-
sion. The environment of the university enabled the founders to test their 
ideas in the walled garden of Harvard University. Yet Facebook is hardly a 
poster child for the success story of a Harvard startup.
Author Melba Kurman recommends that universities update their perfor-
mance metrics and include the following measures (among others)1:
Ability to turn research into public benefit
• 
Impact on industry—that is, ability to add value to the 
• 
industry
Commercialization impact
• 
Such upgraded metrics should paint a more realistic picture of how exactly 
research translates into public goods. Lord Kelvin sums up the entire debate: 
“When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in num-
bers, you know something about it; but when you cannot express it in num-
bers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind.”2
Most research projects never have an effect on the taxpayers who funded 
them. They never attempt to solve the challenges they study in the developing 
countries where they could make a difference. This is a serious matter, and the 
managing directors of some university research centers have taken notice that 
the status quo of commercialization lacks  measurable impact. The first step 
is to upgrade their metrics and get a clearer picture about where research 
projects stand on the impact scale. This will simplify the discussion in moving 
toward a more entrepreneurial ecosystem at universities.
Patents and Tech Transfer
Without talking about patents and technology transfer, a discussion of the 
impact of research would be incomplete. Traditionally, universities have thought 
in terms of patents to commercialize their research. After all, research is expen-
sive, and there should be a means to recoup at least part of the cost. If a technol-
ogy is patentable, the university hires an attorney to file for patent protection. 
The in-house technology transfer office (TTO) or technology licensing office 
(TLO)—both names are used interchangeably—licenses pending and granted

patents to those who are interested. Protected intellectual property is acces-
sible to industrial companies that can license the technology and integrate it in 
their product lines.
Alternatively, the research team that invented a patented technology gets a 
license from the university for its own use and ventures into business by 
itself. This model works for university entrepreneurs if they have the where-
withal to transform the technology into a real business. Because most aca-
demic spin-offs of the past centered on patents, the TLOs of many universities 
became the overseers of startup and entrepreneurship programs. And that is 
where the problems begin. Licensing is seldom the main issue with startups; 
rather, the issues are time to market and approaching the venture from a solid 
business standpoint. When the TLO is in charge of startups, entrepreneurial 
advice is often limited to workshops or theoretical support by the TLO staff 
or the business faculty. As a result, commercialization efforts fall short of 
expectations. Lack of mission of the TLO is the core problem. It is unclear 
what it means to achieve “effective university technology transfer.”3 As long as 
the TLO can make the point that they are within historical benchmarks, then 
any extra effort introduces risk into their daily business. The bar is set low at 
1% of all patents ever finding a licensee, in the best case.4 Leaving startup pro-
grams to those in charge of patents can be counterproductive. Filing a patent 
has little to do with innovation, let alone entrepreneurship.
Despite the fact that they cost money and perform poorly, universities are 
proud of their patent portfolios. The number of patents filed sometimes even 
stands in as a synonym for innovation. This appears to be a trend especially in 
Asia. For example, with the goal to declare Singapore the IP Hub of Asia,5 the 
government of the city state pointed to the many patent filings by domestic 
universities. This seems to make the point for Singapore as hotbed for intel-
lectual property, as long as nobody is asking about the amount of licensing 
revenue or the quality of the patents. The liberal approach taken by the intel-
lectual property office in Singapore has led to rapid growth in the number of 
granted patents over the last ten years, including patents with little or no real 
merit.6 Certain key performance indicators (KPIs) for universities and the 
government may check out, but it is doubtful that such portfolios will ever 
attract the interest of potential licensees. The patent revenue could be exactly 
zero—nobody knows for sure. Realizing the flaw of mistaking the number of

patent filings for innovation, Singapore vowed to improve patent quality with 
a “positive grant” system at the beginning of 2014 that requires a positive, 
substantive examination report before a patent is granted.7
Singapore is no outlier when it comes to patents with low commercial value. 
Research shows that university patent portfolios are performing poorly. A 
report from the Brookings Institution makes recommendations for increasing 
support for startup formation but implies that most university TTOs are not 
self-supporting through patent-licensing income. As Brookings shows, univer-
sities spend most their licensing revenues rewarding inventors or funding new 
research, not supporting technology transfer.8 An older study came to similar 
conclusions, arguing that most American research universities lose money on 
patenting and licensing technologies.9 Almost 75% of universities in America 
and Canada with TTOs have difficulties to cover the costs of filing patents and 
their own operations with licensing revenue. About 15% barely break even, 
recouping less than 4% of university research spending, and an estimated 99% 
of patents never make any money.10
To boost their performance, TTOs often ask for additional funds. If only they 
had more funding, they could hire new staff who would undergo entrepre-
neurial training to coach students and researchers about launching a startup. 
I doubt this approach will solve the problem, because a larger bureaucracy 
will hardly spawn more entrepreneurial success. Only a mind shift can get the 
debate about university research’s lack of impact out of its rut.
Open IP
Open IP promises to replace the drive to patent by making technology freely 
accessible. Under this notion, researchers immediately publish their findings 
and thereby release any intellectual property into the public domain. This so-
called bazaar approach, a term borrowed from open source software develop-
ment, should spawn more collaborations between industry and research teams 
and therefore hopefully improve market impact.11 In the software world, open 
source has become a huge success. Some open source projects like Linux are 
competing head to head with industry giants.

Whether open source has resulted in a larger impact by university research 
is up for debate. When universities talk about open IP, the term comes with 
strings attached. Ownership of projects is often unclear, with several research 
parties claiming that a certain technology was invented by their faculty.
If open IP were on the rise, then the number of patent filings per year should 
be decreasing. But the opposite is happening, both in industry and at universi-
ties. According to a report by the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO), international patent applications filed through the Patent Cooperation 
Treaty (PCT) have rebounded strongly since the global economic crisis. Growth 
in the number of filings has picked up by 5.7% in 2010, 11% in 2011, and 7.1% 
in 2012. The total number of filings made via the PCT system amounted to 
195,308 in 2012, which is more than double the figure recorded in 2000.12 
Data from the U.S. National Research Foundation (NSF) shows the same 
trend. U.S. universities filed 18,163 patent applications in 2009, with a positive 
annual growth rate between 0.10% and 12.25% between 1999 and 2009 (see 
Figure 15-1).13 This is hadly proof of fewer patents, nor is it a case for open IP 
taking off on a large scale. There is no evidence that this trend will reverse in 
the coming years.

Why Are 
University 
Startups Not 
Taking Off?
This chapter looks at the gaps that exist in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, 
which we encountered in part 1 of this book. To overcome those gaps and 
improve the startup launch pad, both entrepreneurs and universities need to 
make a concerted effort. Dabbling in entrepreneurship will not work—you 
either do it or you don’t. Dabbling always results in mediocrity, not only in 
entrepreneurship, but in everything you do in life.
A university may have startup initiatives in place. Grants and workshops about 
entrepreneurship may exist. The library may carry copies of The Four Steps to 
the Epiphany1 and The Lean Startup.2 business-plan competition and exchanges 
with the university’s MBA program may be carried out to stimulate the entre-
preneurial drive of students and researchers. Although these are all good

intentions, they do too little to actually make a startup successful. More fire-
power is required to get startups off the ground. With this I mean more than 
massive funding. Despite large government grants, most universities are still 
uncertain about how to build an ecosystem for entrepreneurship.
Thinking About Startups in Terms of 
Opportunity Cost
A good approach to think about startups is in terms of opportunity cost. 
What if technology keeps lingering in patent portfolios without ever making 
an impact. What will happen if universities fail to build the bridge to the busi-
ness world? Cost is measured in terms of more than money. The loss of a 
much-needed public good or social change may be as painful as losing millions 
of dollars.
Because startups are beginning to make inroads in universities’ key perfor-
mance indicators, it is only a matter of time until someone looks at the impact 
of these startups. It will no longer be sufficient to have startups on paper that 
never gain any real traction. University research can be extremely valuable, but 
only if it is available as a product or service in the real world. Roadblocks to 
startup success result in great losses for humanity. Forgoing the opportunity 
to make an impact with its research and to foster a success story costs the 
university prestige and future funding. 
Jumpstarting Knowledge Exchange
Most universities have only weak ties to established companies and multina-
tional corporations. Hold on, you say. There is plenty of interaction between 
the business community and university research. Yes, companies do sponsor 
research modules and work directly with research scientists. This is a conve-
nient practice for corporations to outsource their R&D and save money and 
human resources by hiring researchers inexpensively to do work for them. 
This results in maximum knowledge transfer to the corporation and zero 
knowledge transfer to the university about how business and entrepreneur-
ship work. Hardly a prestigious arrangement for the university, if you look at 
it in this light.
Universities and their startups often set the bar too low regarding what 
they expect from corporate joint venture partners. They are often delighted 
that a multinational even talks with them. They ask for a small allowance to 
buy materials, a few months of overhead, and free use of certain machinery. 
Nonetheless, the multinational will save millions in R&D that it would

159
otherwise have to spend. Universities overlook this part of the bargain. Such 
practices have created a strange dynamic between corporate partners and 
research teams—one that is unsustainable for startups in the long run. I 
believe it would be much more helpful for universities to engage with industry 
earlier and with the more targeted goal of forming genuine joint ventures with 
researchers. Not only would this create more of an entrepreneurial dynamic 
for the university’s startup track, but it would also transfer valuable business 
skills from corporations to the startups. This two-way knowledge transfer is 
currently lacking. It may exist in short workshops, but rarely in true business 
interactions. 
In a nutshell, the current environment in most universities fails to foster 
startup success. Ingredients that could make a real difference are missing. As 
a consequence, universities’ current commercialization efforts fall short of 
expectations and promises. Entrepreneurship initiatives are well-intentioned, 
but they are far removed from the reality of how startups thrive. Startup 
entrepreneurs often have the wrong impression of what it is like to run their 
own company. They also have minimal incentives to make their startups work, 
because they can go back to the safe haven of the university and take on a paid 
position. Contemporary relationships with the business community are one-
sided and tilted toward the benefit of corporations that let taxpayer-funded 
research teams do their R&D. As a consequence, close to zero university 
startups ever make an impact in the market. This is quite a dire summary, but 
there is hope on the horizon.
University research is very valuable. Countless inventions used today in the 
market originated from university research. But research institutions need to 
catch up with the new model of startups and entrepreneurship. In the last 
decade, there have been tectonic shifts in the practice of launching and run-
ning businesses. Advances in IT technology, automation, rapid prototyping, and 
digitization have made it easier to commercialize research right out of the uni-
versity lab. Entrepreneurship is a skill that is becoming increasingly important. 
Students and researchers should learn this skill to compete on a global scale.
Universities are still on the vanguard of relevant research. They have noticed 
that they should include more entrepreneurial thinking in their structure, but 
they still need to find the right approach. Startups and universities should get 
used to the fact that they need to go all the way to make a measurable impact. 
A Ferrari without gas in the tank will not get you anywhere. Holding one 
more brainstorming session or inviting an expert for a morning workshop will 
barely move the needle. To have true success stories that can compete on a 
global scale, both startup entrepreneurs and universities must take extra steps 
beyond the obvious and beyond their current efforts. To bring about change, 
they must leave their comfort zones.  

Chapter 16 | Why Are University Startups Not Taking Off?

Stronger Entrepreneurship Networks 
A peculiar trait of university entrepreneurs is that few of them know anyone 
who has launched a profitable startup. The same is true for universities, which 
are rarely in contact with experienced businesspeople or startup veterans. 
Yes, there are many business-plan competitions, but few of them ever result in 
profitable businesses that last beyond the semester. University startups there-
fore often have zero firsthand insight into what it means to start a company. 
They have nobody to turn to for hands-on advice.
Being in contact with experienced entrepreneurs would be most helpful to 
students and researchers. If they can tackle challenges together and actively 
work on their own startup process with a startup veteran, they can ben-
efit greatly. The impact of such direct knowledge goes far beyond weekend 
workshops in business-plan writing. An entrepreneur-in-residence program 
(EIR), described in chapter 20, can be a step in this direction. Such a program 
requires planning and administration by the university and will not come to 
pass overnight. Until stronger networks and connections to entrepreneurs 
exist, students and researchers should know that they cannot rely on the 
university or the government to build connections for them. Once more, they 
have to learn how to do this themselves.
Hands-Off Approach
Noncompetitive thinking plagues not only universities but most large orga-
nizations. For employees who are going through the motions until 5:00 p.m. 
rolls around, entrepreneurship and learning have no mindshare. Most large 
organizations focus not on innovation but on continuing operation and effi-
ciency.3 They are on the declining end of the industry life cycle. A strategy to 
escape their certain downfall is to buy new companies with fresh ideas, who 
then help the aging giants reinvent their business model. Entrepreneurship and 
innovation rarely originate in these large institutions: they develop elsewhere 
and find their way into the existing framework through takeovers or joint 
ventures.4
Even though there may be voices in a university who speak for more entre-
preneurship at all levels, initiatives that yield measurable impacts are far and 
few between. When the rubber hits the road, startups cannot launch passively 
with a hands-off approach. This applies to students, researchers, and university 
staff alike. In the startup game, competition has to enter the minds of those

who want to play. This is at odds with the present-day model of universities. 
They prefer to do the research, publish a paper, and then let someone else 
commercialize. This surrender is unfortunate and wastes the natural syner-
gies that are waiting to empower university startups. With a more competi-
tive approach to entrepreneurship, universities could learn to take advantage 
of all the energy that is right in front of them.
Limited Startup Expertise at Universities
Few people at a university or tech-transfer office have ever launched a com-
pany, so they cannot be blamed for not being startup experts. Yet they are the 
ones coaching and guiding entrepreneurs, firmly anchored in theory without 
applied experience. At the end of the year, the university may have achieved 
its key performance indicators of X startups or spin-off companies, but the 
impact in the real world still hovers around zero. All this reinforces the notion 
that entrepreneurship requires great effort and a huge body of knowledge to 
get right. The conclusion is often that somebody else should deal with it.
Roughly speaking, there are two schools of thought about entrepreneur-
ship: that an MBA degree and advanced business skills are required to have a 
real shot, and that entrepreneurship is simple and requires little more than a 
10-step program (or 20-step, depending on which book you read). Depending 
on which ideology your university subscribes to, it will either focus on theo-
retical knowledge and procedures that need to be followed, or it will take 
a laissez-faire approach. As you may expect, the reality lies somewhere in 
between. Startups require certain business skills that are not native to aca-
demic life. They should also be free of rules, processes, and theory, with 
enough room to experiment and explore which approach works best for 
them. Just like students and researchers, startup advisors at universities and 
the government should understand that entrepreneurship is first and fore-
most a mindset. A startup can succeed with no theory but the right attitude. 
If a team lacks motivation and an open mind, the best advice and coaching will 
fall on infertile ground.
Most researchers I work with are passionate about their plans but lack the 
entrepreneurial mindset and the tools that only first-hand experience can 
bring. Because they were researchers their whole life up to this point, they 
often lack the know-how to take their ideas from the lab to the market. To 
make matters worse, university startups are often given the run-around by a 
system designed by bureaucrats who are more concerned with statistics than 
startup success. Unnecessary politics and requirements for lengthy proposals 
to apply for this or that grant can break the creative flow of startups and sap 
their energy. This leaves them resorting to the path of least resistance: com-
plying with the rules, one eye already on taking a teaching position when the 
venture inevitably tanks. Hardly a good place to start. 

Chapter 16 | Why Are University Startups Not Taking Off?
162
Instead of theory about entrepreneurship, passionate students and research-
ers interested in launching a startup need to learn first what it means to run 
a company, warts and all. Most workshops at universities focus a particular 
strategy, with too much focus on a single piece of the equation. Somebody 
may recount their own startup success story, using a specific approach. In this 
light, a startup seems like a fun ride that students and researchers are anx-
ious to try right after the workshop. But the entire picture is often missing. 
Inevitably, they get stuck because they lack the know-how to proceed after 
the initial enthusiasm has worn off.
Startups Defy Standardization
There is no all-purpose approach to launch successful startups. Just as their 
technology, products, and business models are all unique, the personalities 
and tempers of their founding teams are diverse. And that is good: otherwise, 
entrepreneurship would no longer be innovative. Trying to press all startups 
into the same cookie-cutter schema may homogenize them and make them 
easier to manage, but it will do little for their success. Unfortunately, the 
best entrepreneurs are put off by the bureaucracy of a standardized system 
and may give up if it is the only way to launch a startup at their university. 
Entrepreneurship is an individual affair. It goes against the grain of any stan-
dardized process that a university or government puts in place for startups. 
More important than fixed procedures is the freedom to experiment. There 
must be room for this freedom in one form or another, to let entrepreneurs 
find their stride.
Many universities say they want to advance their startups, create a more 
entrepreneurial culture, and enable their students and researchers with the 
know-how to start a spin-off company from their research assignments. 
Putting these words into practice is often another story, and doing so is 
much more complex than the university imagined when it made the com-
mitment. Entrepreneurship is not a neat thing that can be put in a box, which 
results in confusion and frustration for many students and researchers who 
give it a shot. When the startup team has had enough of their lack of success, 
they throw in the towel, return to their research positions, and chalk up the 
experience as an interesting experiment. At least they tried, they rational-
ize. Grand Maste. Yoda once more has the perfect answer: “Do. Or do not. 
There is no try.”5 However, what exactly to do is the question, and there are 
no standard answers. 
What worked for this startup may not work for that startup. What was 
gospel yesterday may find itself in the garbage bin today, only to reemerge 
tomorrow. The one thing that stays consistent is that entrepreneurs need the

right attitude to achieve success. Setbacks are unavoidable, and entrepreneurs 
need to be able to face them effectively. A simple set of techniques that help 
develop a marketable idea quickly and incrementally is the starting point. From 
there on, startups have a real chance to get feedback in the market and engage 
with others. By writing their own manual, they find out how to bridge the gap 
between being a student or researcher and a startup entrepreneur. Then can 
they decide whether this journey is something they wish to embark on.
Entrepreneurship as a Job
The tenure track is less appealing than it used to be for many researchers. 
Lifetime positions at universities have become rarer, and the lure of excite-
ment at a startup has caused many PhDs and postdocs to think about the road 
to entrepreneurship.
If your research finds a solution to a pressing problem that enough people 
struggle with, the university is the ideal springboard for a startup. It is far 
harder to launch on your own. Imagine if you had to reproduce all the infra-
structure made available by your university: an air-conditioned office, a work-
ing high-speed Internet connection, a print room, IT, tech support, expensive 
machines and tools, workshops, and so forth. On your own, the cost of this 
infrastructure would quickly amount to thousands, if not tens of thousands, 
of dollars per month. But most important, universities provide other benefits 
for startups. They are platforms on which different parties come together, 
including governments, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, the business 
community, and the financial sector. All this can help startups succeed, given 
the right approach. None of it is available to startups outside of universities. 
You should seize this huge advantage if you can.
However, there is a flip side to the wealth of resources readily available for 
startups at universities. Researchers sometimes see a startup as a convenient 
way to extend their university assignment, without having a genuine interest 
in making their company work. They take the lottery approach to entrepre-
neurship: writing a business plan, applying for a government grant, and hoping 
they win. When they do, they breathe a sigh of relief because their salary and 
overhead at the university are secure for a few more months. They dabble in 
entrepreneurship, in effect doing the same work they were already doing on 
their research assignment. Despite their lack of a sellable product, they hope 
to hit the jackpot when a venture capitalist or joint venture partner comes 
along and invests millions of dollars in them.
This approach has little to do with the reality of successful entrepreneurship. 
At the root of it, once more, is a false notion of what a startup is and how it 
comes about. As long as this thinking prevails, university startups will struggle 
to achieve results in the real world. Because universities are comfortable envi-
ronments, they indirectly encourage researchers to take the lottery approach 

Chapter 16 | Why Are University Startups Not Taking Off?
164
to entrepreneurship. If they hit the jackpot, great. If they don’t, nothing changes. 
Most of these startups inevitably fail. Unfortunately, the verdict is often that 
these failures are the result of insufficient funding for startups. In reality, the 
opposite is true: too much funding exists, providing life support for students 
and researchers who lack the motivation to make their startups succeed. 
Launching a startup and a job at a university are two different animals. 
Entrepreneurs and employees have completely different motivations, expecta-
tions, and schedules.  Students and researchers should understand this as early 
as possible. Otherwise, they might confuse a startup with a paid position at a 
university.

How Universities 
Can Support 
Their Startups 
Today
Many universities are adventurous when it comes to research and new tech-
nology in a lab setting. But when the conversation turns to commercializing 
this research, academics often remain on the sidelines. There is still a chasm 
between academia, the business community, and the financial world. However, 
many decision-makers at universities I had the pleasure working welcome 
new ideas for entrepreneurship and commercialization. They have shown 
great interest and support, and I wish to thank them for their openness.
Clearly, no institution of higher learning can or should reform overnight and 
become a business school or an investment bank. Suggesting sweeping changes 
will therefore fall on dumb ears and will be more counterproductive than  
anything else. It’s better to focus first on a few simple guidelines that can 
make it easier for new startups to embark on the entrepreneurial path. I 
discuss some of these in this second part of the book. All of them require 
active participation by the startups. If a team lacks genuine interest in learning 
about practical entrepreneurship, then it will be very difficult to help them 
­succeed. Let’s therefore assume that all entrepreneurs are keen to learn and 
are ­hell-bent on making their startup work.

Chapter 17 | How Universities Can Support Their Startups Today
166
Give Guidelines, but Don’t Micromanage
Universities should stop treating their startups with a one-size-fits-all 
approach. As this book explored earlier, universities should refrain from  
forcing ­entrepreneurs down the grant track as the first order of business. 
Writing lengthy documentation, proposals, or, even worse, business plans 
make little sense for startup entrepreneurs. Universities should let them 
experiment without doing much planning. Just as the grant track paints a false 
picture in young entrepreneurs’ minds of what it means to launch a startup, 
so do micromanagement and over protectiveness. All parents must at some 
point let their children make mistakes on their own. This process may be hard 
for advisors and professors who have been working closely with students and 
researchers, but it is essential for a startup to collect personal experiences 
in the real world. Without the opportunity to fail from time to time, startups 
will never learn to fly.
Universities can clear roadblocks and make resources available. This can enable 
students to develop their startups without hassles and help them to take 
the first steps towards entrepreneurship. They will have the best chance to  
succeed if non-entrepreneurial duties burden them as little as possible.  
Testing minimum viable products, putting together business models and finan-
cial plans, and engaging non-academics with potential partnerships are quite 
different tasks from the daily business of other academics. Make sure startups 
can do their work uninterrupted, at least part of the time. Research team 
members may still have other important roles to perform at the university, 
such as finishing their PhD or postdoc, and the team may be pursuing entre-
preneurship on their own schedule. In this case, see that they fulfill their duties, 
and then let them run.
A startup mentor may also help set up certain guidelines to help the university 
understand what startup entrepreneurship entails over the first few months. 
Most faculty will be just as confused as the founders.
Mentors vs. Workshops
At a university I worked with, several students and researchers had the oppor-
tunity to attend workshops on Lean Startup and business modeling, one of 
which was conducted by author Alex Osterwalder, who invented the Business 
Model Canvas.1 That weekend workshop was exciting; but the results for the 
individual startups were mixed, as I learned in one of my follow-up consulting 
sessions. The participants’ PowerPoint presentations were less academic and

Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2010).

University Startups and Spin-Offs
167
had been tuned up with more business speak. Nonetheless, fundamental inse-
curities about the journey ahead still prevailed. Teams were now aware that 
there was a thing called the “business model canvas,” but few had completed 
one for their startup. Those who did were staring at a piece of paper that 
made certain statements about their company and their market, with no idea 
what to do next.
When learning about the Lean Startup method, several of its concepts are far 
from intuitive at first sight. The main issues have to do with the business model 
canvas and the minimum viable product (MVP). If you are unsure what these 
are, then look them up in Chapter 2, where they were introduced. But let’s 
first go back to that workshop. Over the weekend, the startups learned about 
the need to collect feedback from the market about their product as soon 
as possible. In a consulting session the week after the workshop, I asked one 
of the teams, a software startup, about their next steps. They did not know 
how to respond. Using the business model canvas, they had completed several 
questions about their product, their potential market, and how to serve that 
market. However, the most important part was missing: the startup team was 
unaware that they should be making a test version of their software. How 
could they get any feedback from the market if they had nothing to test?  
A software startup without software is like a restaurant without food.
The team had always assumed that a large software firm would come along, 
start a joint venture with them, and then do the product testing and develop-
ment on its own. They saw their strength in their sophisticated algorithm and 
therefore never bothered with a user interface for the software. But estab-
lished companies are unlikely to flock to a startup with an invisible product 
and no feedback from potential users. Teams have to test their MVP to under-
stand whether anyone in the market even wants what they produce. If they 
do, then the next question is whether consumers are ready to spend enough 
money so the startup can become profitable. With this first-hand intelligence, 
they can later approach a joint venture partner.
The software startup without software found itself stuck in a loop: they needed 
to get feedback from the market about their product, but to do that, they first 
needed a joint venture partner to help them make the product. And to attract 
a joint venture partner, they needed to get feedback from the market.
I am not trying to poke fun at these entrepreneurs. They are smart individuals. 
Analysis paralysis is common if you have been working on a project for a long 
time. Even though the solution may seem obvious in hindsight, a workshop 
rarely solves current challenges. It can therefore be advantageous to get the 
perspective of a mentor. This should be an entrepreneur who can offer a fresh 
look at things. The mentor can help the team solve challenges as they arise. If 
a seasoned entrepreneur is made available during a startup’s initial stages, the 
difference can be like night and day.

Another team I worked with wanted to create language learning materials 
based on certain academic research. Under “key resoruces” in their business 
model canvas, they listed the need to raise six-digit funding to complete a line 
of several books and audio programs in different languages. They would then 
sell this material to schools and universities. They were struggling to raise the 
funding at the time I got involved. A few simple questions turned up major 
flaws in their approach. Did they ever test a lesson with potential clients? Did 
it make sense to roll out the entire product line at the same time? What about 
testing which languages would have the deepest market? Stuck with planning 
and brainstorming their product line, the startup had never thought about 
proof of concept with real market testing. They assumed they would first have 
to complete the entire product line to be a real company. “Build, measure, 
learn” is not a household concept, and it may take some time to get the hang 
of it. Having a qualified outsider available for advice can make all the difference 
between success and giving up.
When getting feedback from potential clients, you need to be creative. In 
my own startups, we sometimes made software mockups in Microsoft Excel, 
dressed up to look like a web site (more or less). Clicking a button (nothing 
more than a colored cell) linked to a new sheet in the workbook to simulate 
the next page. Mockups can be messy; they contain bugs and often have just 
a tiny set of the features. But putting a simple mockup of your idea in front of 
people should be the first order of business. Most of the time, these take less 
than 24 hours to produce and require zero funding. Endless deliberating about 
how to start leads nowhere—the most important thing is taking the first step 
as soon as possible.
Creating an overall atmosphere of entrepreneurship at a university is a laudable 
goal, but it often leaves would-be entrepreneurs without workable strategies 
to achieve success. Most university staff and faculty have never started their 
own venture and can therefore provide only limited guidance when a startup 
hits the ground running. Working with a mentor one-on-one on specific 
challenges is infinitely more helpful. This will hardly break the bank of the 
university, but the benefits for the startups will be more powerful than the 
best business model workshop.
Integrate Startups in Management Activities
University research teams and management staff exist in parallel worlds. 
Startups can benefit from taking part in the everyday fabric of university life. 
Managing a university involves many activities in which startups could share. 
No sweeping changes are necessary; simply thinking of entrepreneurial students 
and researchers when planning events and receptions. Suppose there is a  
conference in town where the university has a booth. How about ­offering 
some space to startup entrepreneurs to conduct further MVP testing,  

University Startups and Spin-Offs

interview prospects, and get feedback about their business models? Startups 
can profit from leaving the building to see how a tradeshow works. Make it 
known when such events take place, and give students and researchers the 
opportunity to take part.
Instead of giving visitors a general tour of the facilities, propose that they 
drop in on one of the startup labs that is showcasing an experiment with an 
MVP. When the government comes by, ask startups to pitch instead of having 
a professor give a lecture. Many possibilities exist to integrate startups in the 
everyday hustle and bustle of the university management and support.
Startup entrepreneurs can volunteer to guide certain visitors around the 
facility, all the while getting feedback about the problems they are working on. 
Because startups are learning to shift the discussion from features to benefits, 
every chance to reach out to test subjects can be used as practice to engage 
them for feedback. This creates knowledge about potential partners and clients 
that will move the startups further along with their business models and 
market studies.
Enable Industry Networking
Entrepreneurs must try to leverage everything at the university for their 
benefit. If your university is a certain size, it may take part in a conference or 
technology fair. Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and multination-
als also attend these events. They provide an ideal platform for startups to 
network with potential clients, future joint venture partners, investors, and 
competitors right on the battlefield. Teams can collect business cards and 
begin a list of e-mail addresses and phone numbers that they can use in their 
evolution down the road. Startup entrepreneurs can never have too many 
contacts in their networks.
Attending university networking functions gets a new meaning for startups 
with a solid business model and the mindset of engaging others with action-
able next steps. Because they have discovered the importance of a strong 
network, startup entrepreneurs know better than standing around with peers 
they already know, or wish they had never attended in the first place. They 
actively pitch their startup and engage contacts with actionable next steps. 
Luck favors the prepared: a single conversation or new contact can change the 
trajectory of a startup and give it a turbo boost.
This is all great, you may say, but our university rarely participates in such 
events. In this case, how can startups make more frequent contact with indus-
try? One idea is to establish your own networking events. Hold on, you say; 
networking events we already have. Yes, companies may contact the university 
and tour the premises and labs to watch demonstrations and hear lectures 
about certain technologies. But are several companies ever invited together? 

Chapter 17 | How Universities Can Support Their Startups Today
170
How about an entire sector? What about a full industry group or trade orga-
nization? Interaction may exist one-on-one, but this lacks the scale to enable 
a vivid exchange of ideas and true networking. The university could offer a 
platform to make that happen. It would also be interesting for companies 
to network with each other. How about reaching out to industry groups or 
trade organizations and inviting them for an afternoon of networking, with 
refreshments? Instead of lecturing them on research and technology, startup 
teams can ask their opinion of MVPs and market assumptions. They can use 
the networking event to gain as much intelligence as possible without having 
to leave the building. Rather than startups reaching out to companies on their 
own, bring companies to them once in a while.
Fail Smart and Collect Data
Of course, it is never fun to admit that an undertaking failed. Most people feel 
uncomfortable with the notion of failure. As a result, they frame all of their 
efforts as successes. Even if a team failed to achieve certain results, they learned 
something in the process—at least they tried to do something. Unfortunately, 
this mindset  allows failure to become an accepted, everyday event. If you 
frame failures as successes, startups will lose their edge. If they think that 
burning through $250,000 in grant money without launching a product is OK, 
then they are on the wrong track from day one.
In retrospect, however, even such failures can provide valuable data for the 
university and startups that will follow. They should review failed startup 
together with the team and register their findings. How did the entrepreneurs 
attack the endeavor? How long were they at it? When did they declare defeat 
and wind down the company? How many MVPs did they test? How many 
potential joint venture partners did they engage? What did they ask from 
those potential partners? Did they launch a product in the market? And so on. 
Myriad questions are possible.
If a university has a startup track, it can gain insight by recording all the steps 
its startups take. This makes it easier to spot patterns. Then startups can 
be tracked and gently nudged toward taking reasonable actions when they 
become confused or veer off course.
What you cannot measure, you cannot improve. Having more data to mine 
will hardly make the university a new entrepreneurship hub over night. Even 
when droves of data exist, not every startup will succeed. There is no fail-safe 
procedure that ensures hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue within a 
few short years. But learning what contributes to startup failure will result in 
a helpful tool that makes your university’s startup program smarter over time. 
It will take a while and several startups to arrive at a workable database. If 
­failing smart sounds interesting to you, then you should begin collecting data as 
soon as possible. This may even become part of a course at a related business 
school.

Building a 
Bridge to  
the Market
Currently, few links exist between universities and the business community. 
This makes sense, because both work differently. State-funded universities 
largely run as not-for-profit entities, whereas businesses with shareholders are 
at home in the capitalist paradigm. Regardless, universities often declare that 
they benefit from established links to the business community. These exist 
mainly in research, where corporations sponsor certain projects. However, 
when examined more closely, such connections do little for university start-
ups—as I have mentioned, they are often nothing more than a convenient 
strategy for corporations to let researchers do their R&D inexpensively. Such 
links are not particularly valuable for universities, and the knowledge exchange 
is lopsided. Corporations extract know-how from university research teams, 
but universities gain no insight about how entrepreneurship works and how 
they could better commercialize research in the market. This is unfortunate, 
and some universities have begun to realize there is room for improvement.
Most important, it would be good if universities integrated market-oriented 
thinking in areas beyond the research level with their PhD and postdoc pro-
grams. On the degree level, know-how about applying academic research in 
the market is almost entirely missing.
The rest of this chapter presents some general assumptions about why a pivot 
toward more entrepreneurship may be difficult for some universities. I also 
offer recommendations about how to address these difficulties.

Chapter 18 | Building a Bridge to the Market 
172
Focus on Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SMEs), Not Large Multinationals
Universities often try to attract large multinational corporations to sponsor 
research projects or collaborate in other ways. The corporations shoulder 
the financial risk by underwriting a part of the research. In reality, the amounts 
they contribute to these projects are small fry compared to their overall profits. 
Plus, large corporations are tax optimized, often reside in Switzerland, and 
pass most of the tax burden to their employees. If they hit upon a goldmine 
with a product developed in a joint research program, the windfall will rarely 
benefit the university or the researchers.
On the other hand, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the real drivers 
of economies. Companies with fewer than 99 employees are comparable to 
large firms in their contribution to aggregate employment.1 They are important 
engines of job creation and GDP growth in developed and emerging markets.
Most universities treat SMEs as an afterthought. It is of course much more 
prestigious to announce joint projects with multinationals than with smaller, 
local companies, but this practice should change. If governments want to sup-
port the economy, they should give SMEs better access to universities: for 
example, in the form of tax breaks, guarantees, or risk sharing. Giving SMEs 
more access to inexpensive research would help make a larger impact in 
society. This could go hand in hand with establishing practices for a more 
balanced knowledge exchange that would actually help universities become 
more entrepreneurial.
Is the Current System Up to the Task?
Startups are inherently hands-on. Little know-how about rolling up one’s sleeves 
and turning research into marketable products currently exists in universities. 
This makes universities less than ideal experts on the topic of entrepreneur-
ship and stipulates the need for knowledge transfer from sources outside of 
academia. The market is by definition the battlefield on which entrepreneur-
ship takes place. Why not tap into this source to glean some insight about 
how to commercialize innovation? Later, this chapter investigates how univer-
sities can build stronger bridges to the market to help their startups become 
more entrepreneurial and compete with businesses in the real world.

University Startups and Spin-Offs
173
Can universities reinvent themselves and suddenly become startup hubs? 
Most of them lack the capacity to reproduce Stanford University in Silicon 
Valley. Laying the foundation for successful startups will take a while. A cultural 
shift will need to take place, and this needs time and patience. Unfortunately, a 
mind shift is impossible while continuing to do more of the same—more grant 
funding, more lectures by MBAs, and more business plan competitions. These 
will be of little help in the long run. If universities want to promote startup 
success, they need a deeper understanding of how entrepreneurship comes 
into being: how they can enable it from the bottom up, not try to force it into 
existence from the top down.
Because universities need a radical paradigm shift, their current advisors may 
not be up to the task. Government officials are hardly startup entrepreneurs. 
Neither are MBA students, professors in economics and finance, or the tech-
nology licensing office (TLO). Considerable trust is placed in those with strong 
incentives to stick with the status quo. A fundamental mind shift must occur 
to put universities on the right track. The longer universities put off change, 
the harder it will be to bring about a course correction later.
Learning from the Market
A pivot toward entrepreneurship can be achieved better by learning by doing 
than by lecturing. To learn more about this field, universities need to build a 
stronger bridge to the market. Just as launching a startup is an experiment, 
universities need to test different approaches and find the ones that yield the 
best measurable results for them. They should do this by integrating applied 
business knowledge much earlier than in the research stage of academic edu-
cation. If degree students have regular contact with market practitioners who 
have walked the walk and can tell war stories about their trials and tribu-
lations, those students can gain considerable insight. When they reach the 
research level in their PhD or postdoc, they will already understand how the 
market works. This will be a huge advantage over those living in the ivory 
tower of academia who are exposed to business for the first time at age 35.
Universities should be concerned with empowering their students and 
researchers with the know-how to launch businesses in the twenty-first cen-
tury. If they achieve that, many more university startups can make a difference 
in the lives of people who benefit from the innovative products the startups 
bring to the market. To make an impact, startups should gather this knowl-
edge right at the source.

Chapter 18 | Building a Bridge to the Market

Industry Links
Entrepreneurial students and researchers profit in many ways from stronger 
links to industry. Universities should seek and welcome connections not only 
with large multinationals but also with SMEs. The latter may be appreciative 
and loyal partners for university startups, especially when a two-way informa-
tion exchange takes place.
At present, university startups often feel that they have to go the entire dis-
tance alone. The founders take management and accounting courses and think 
about how to sell products and distribute them in the market. It is good to 
understand as many aspects of business as possible in the early stages of a 
startup. However, when entrepreneurs are ready to launch their final product, 
they need to focus their energy. They need a more effective way to manage 
the moving parts in their operations than doing everything by themselves.
Management and sales skills seldom come overnight, and it can be worth-
while for a startup to join forces with an established company to shoulder 
these tasks. Nowadays, a joint venture is often an afterthought for a univer-
sity startup. If it exists, as you’ve seen, it is often an outsourced R&D lab of 
an industrial partner, who perhaps sponsors some equipment and materi-
als and in return extracts the intellectual property the researchers create. 
Unfortunately, this arrangement will never allow startups to make a splash. 
They will remain small, tethered R&D labs forever.
Instead, startups should find a way to get joint-venture partners to form com-
panies with them. This will take industry partners out of the pattern of seeing 
universities as a free technology platform from which they can cherry-pick the 
most promising morsels at a discount. When a company is part of a university 
startup earlier in the process, it can help create an entrepreneurial ecosystem 
from which the university’s other startups can profit. Management, distribu-
tion, sales, support—all these functions will be part of the startup’s daily busi-
ness under the tutelage of an experienced joint-venture partner. He helps 
with recruiting operative personnel and support services, and from this link 
with professional managers, entrepreneurs gain knowledge about other fields 
of business that they never knew existed. Successful startups will maintain a 
connection with the university, and having joint ventures in the network will 
provide major future benefits.
Entrepreneur Alumni Networks
It is common for the founders of a successful company to exit it at some point 
to start a new firm. This is often the case in finance, where successful teams 
of managers work at a large investment fund for a few years and then split off 
to start their own fund. Technology and Internet firms are other examples 
where this occurs frequently. These accomplished founding entrepreneurs are 

University Startups and Spin-Offs

often excellent partners for future startups launched from the university. Not 
only can they form a joint venture with new startups, but they may buy entire 
units and integrate them into new enterprises, which kick-starts an active 
knowledge exchange between the market and university startup entrepre-
neurs. Fostering entrepreneurial success and maintaining a link to alumni who 
have achieved it will enable network effects for the university’s entire startup 
track. Universities should be open to harnessing this source of knowledge.
With this in mind, it becomes obvious that enabling entrepreneurial success at 
a university is a multigeneration task. It will rely on establishing a mechanism 
that launches startups, keeps strong links with the founders and joint-venture 
partners, and engages them in the future with attractive opportunities and 
applied research. Some universities may need to rethink some of their pro-
grams in this new light. If there is a choice between offering a PhD program 
that is doing research that is easy to commercialize and one that is not, which 
one should the university choose? This thinking is less relevant to universities 
today, but it may play a bigger role when a startup track is in place.

Platform 
Thinking for 
Startup Success
The first part of this book explored what individual startups can do to improve 
their chances in the market: how they can communicate more effectively with 
outside partners, and how they can organize their business model and finan-
cial model around easy-to-understand principles with which they can engage  
others and kick-start synergies. So far, support from the university only 
includes providing a framework for startups with its existing infrastructure 
and occasional assistance such as hiring a startup coach.
There are also universities that want to take a more active role in entrepre-
neurship. They feel the technology they develop should have a bigger impact 
on people’s lives, or they may be falling short on their key performance indicators 
(KPIs). They organize startup workshops with entrepreneurs and consultants, 
improve interaction with government agencies for technology transfer, and 
support their startups when applying for grants. They may even have a dedi-
cated startup program with a financial matching scheme, where startup teams 
put money into their endeavors that someone else matches. These efforts 
are commendable. But there remains room for improvement, and by that 
I mean other things than adding more of the same. We need a mind shift to 
foster entrepreneurship from a fundamentally different angle at universities. 
This chapter explores what that could look like.

Chapter 19 | Platform Thinking for Startup Success
178
The strategies outlined so far in this book are bottom-up. They originate 
directly with startups, and the entrepreneurs do most of the work, plugging 
in to the university platform only occasionally. Currently, this is the way start-
ups become successful. It is rarely the ones that play by the rules and run the 
length of the grant track that spin off into the market as self-sustaining entities. 
Rather, it is the mavericks that make the real impact.
Author Josh Lerner points out the link between innovation and growth. 
Innovation and new firms are strongly correlated, but public intervention to 
boost venture capital and innovation is largely ineffective.1 This is a thorny 
issue. For a startup to succeed in the current system, it has to avoid taking 
part in public entrepreneurship initiatives. This may sound harsh, but it is fre-
quently true. Few of the launch strategies discussed in this book are included 
in current support programs for startups. This does not have to be the case: 
universities could adapt to the new reality of lean models and guide their 
startups much earlier along that course. This part of the book addresses uni-
versities that want to apply more leverage of their existing platform to boost 
their startup initiatives.
Building Startup Platforms
Universities are platforms. Many diverse fields and opinions come together 
under one roof and mingle with each other in interdisciplinary research. An 
active exchange of ideas takes place between students and scientists of distinct 
faculties. Largely supported by the public sector, universities also interact with 
the government and its agencies, and even with intergovernmental organiza-
tions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Occasionally, 
the business community sponsors events or holds job fairs at universities. 
Banks may finance research projects through university foundations. Many dif-
ferent stakeholders exchange ideas and energy with universities daily, creating 
vast potential resources that are sitting there, unused.
Platform thinking is an innovative approach to maximize these resources. Author 
Sangeet Paul Choudary contrasts this practice with two other paradigms that 
he calls the stuff approach and the optimization approach.2 The stuff approach is 
the current practice of trying to solve a problem by doing more of the same. 
In the context of supporting university startups, this means more grants, more 
workshops, more business-plan competitions, and more technology licensing 
office (TLO) staff. You may already suspect that this will create some jobs and

Capital Have Failed, and What to Do About It (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010).

increase the available budgets, but fail to deliver the results for startups that 
you are after in this book. Slightly better is the optimization approach, which 
adds algorithms to the equation. After collecting all available information, you 
match it with the needs of specific startup entrepreneurs. This avoids pushing 
them into a one-size-fits-all format, but addresses them individually with the 
contacts and information they need at a given time. This is an improvement, 
but it neglects the potential synergy effects that lie dormant at universities.
Enter platform thinking. It goes one step further beyond just collecting and 
matching the available assets: it creates more by tapping into synergies. When 
you apply leverage to all the activities and interactions of which universities 
are a part, a startup ecosystem emerges and grows, powered by network 
effects. Figures 1-1 and 1-2 in Chapter I show what the ideal university ecosys-
tem and the startup launch pad in look like. On a strong platform, the whole 
is greater than the sum of its parts. This sounds intriguing, but how can you 
apply platform thinking at your university? This chapter examines some ideas 
and examples.
The Government Visit
Instead of addressing each stakeholder independently and catering to their 
individual agendas, universities can turn on network effects to help their 
startups. When a government agency visits, what does the university usually 
do? It rolls out the red carpet for the officials, who visit a certain lab where a 
professor makes a presentation about the research of his team on technology 
X. There may then be a lunch or Q&A about that technology with students 
and researchers. Photographers take some pictures. Perhaps there is even a 
TV crew. There may be a public commitment to funding this or that research 
in the future, and another commitment to working together on a certain chal-
lenge. Then the delegation leaves. The university is delighted that the govern-
ment has shown some interest, but students and researchers hardly engaged 
the delegation at all. The visitors had a great field trip and are already looking 
forward to a similar excursion to another university next week.
I suspect that universities are often insecure when the government wishes to 
visit. This is the proverbial rich uncle who pays the bills, so they need to be on 
their best behavior. They breathe a sigh of relief when the visit is over, and the 
last thing on their mind is engaging the government more deeply regarding 
their platform. This is where a mind shift has to occur.
Let’s say a university has five startups. The team working on technology X 
is the furthest advanced, but the other four are also promising. How about 
having all the startups hold short presentations for the delegation? You may 
object that the government agency expressly wanted to see technology X. 
Sure, that’s what they said they wanted, because they were unaware of the 

Chapter 19 | Platform Thinking for Startup Success
180
other four startups. Why not take matters into your own hands and set a new 
agenda for the delegation? Show them something unexpected—something 
out of the box. Framing the visit as a demonstration of your startup track.
Governments love startups because they create jobs. Whenever someone 
takes that initiative in job creation, it looks good for the government to be 
part of it. The delegation will seldom get all the technical details in the presen-
tation about technology X, nor will they take much interest in them. But they 
will definitely understand when you say that technology X could potentially 
provide 100 jobs in the next 2 years. Benefits trump features. If you have  
5 startups, that may be 500 jobs in the next 2 years. Don’t you think it would 
be possible to engage the government to a greater extent with the prospect 
of 500 additional high-profile jobs created by your startups?
Now suppose these startups address problems in environmental sustainabil-
ity. Doesn’t the government have to reach certain targets, perhaps related to 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)?3 Let’s say some of your startups are 
already leading joint-venture discussions with large multinationals. How about 
asking the delegation about public tenders for which these joint ventures 
could put in offers?
There are many other ways to engage the government in this particular exam-
ple, but I will stop here. It is about switching from a passive stance to an 
active role where you engage external stakeholders and ask them to assist 
you. Media coverage of the visit will now be different. Instead of reporting 
the same old story of government officials visiting a research lab, it will tell 
about your university potentially providing 500 new jobs with startups that 
address problems in environmental sustainability. That’s free advertising, and 
it provides leverage for your startups to reach out to the private sector with 
a tailwind.
For this to be possible, your startups need to move up a gear or two. Teams 
need to be more to the point and use the 10/20/30 structure discussed in 
Chapter 10 for their presentations. They need to rehearse their pitches and 
presentations so they fit into 10 minutes. Somebody from the university must 
ensure that startups are up to speed and will not embarrass themselves or the 
university when it matters.
The logistics of such an event will be more challenging than the run-of-the-mill 
reception. You need to keep an eye on many more moving parts. You should 
provide press kits for each startup. Staff and startup founders must be sharp 
and presentable. As always, there is no quick fix to jump to the next level, but 
the effect of channeling attention away from single research projects onto 
your startup platform will be powerful in the long run.

The Industry Visit
Visits from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and multinational corpora-
tions are another great opportunity for startup initiatives. As we have seen, 
links to these companies may exist, but they are often rather uninspired. The 
knowledge transfer from the university to industry takes place through the 
technology transfer or licensing office (TTO or TLO), which makes patented 
technology available for licensees. Alternatively, a company may sponsor a 
research project and extract intellectual property this way. In both cases, 
knowledge flows out of the university into the private sector. Learning more 
about commercializing technology had little mindshare for universities in 
the past, but this should change when their goal is to build platforms for 
their startups.
Turning on knowledge transfer in the opposite direction can help university 
startups gain valuable insight and firsthand experience in how the market 
works. Joint ventures with industry partners are therefore desirable for startups. 
I mean real partnerships between established companies and startups, with 
the goal of launching products right in the market trenches. Few students and 
researchers are born managers, so joint ventures can provide scale to their 
operations in manufacturing and management.
Assume the following scenario: technology X has attracted interest from a 
­multinational industry giant. The company would like to see the lab and the 
technology and may potentially sponsor further development or license the 
technology for the company’s own manufacturing processes. The research team 
happily obliges and shows the industry representatives around the lab. They 
present their work and speak about what they have done so far and the many 
problems they still need to solve. They compare their technology with others 
already on the market and announce that theirs will be greatly superior when 
it is ready for commercial application in five to ten years. They also mention 
that they will need additional funding soon to move forward, on the order of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. The team lead, Professor A, gives a presenta-
tion that spans 200 PowerPoint slides, skipping most of them with the remark 
that one hour is not enough time. In the Q&A session that follows, the industry 
reps ask again about the team’s funding needs. Professor A reiterates that the 
number he mentioned is the minimum funding they need, and, of course, hous-
ing costs, cost-of-living adjustments, and business class flights are not part of this 
budget. In addition, he will need to hire several additional PhDs and postdocs, 
which will take at least six months, if he can find the right candidates.
Put yourself in the shoes of the multinational company. Is this team attractive 
for a joint venture? Unless their technology is a blockbuster, probably not. 
But this is how such interactions are carried out every day. It’s how univer-
sities work and think. Most large companies know this, because many already 
sponsor university research projects. However, if a SME visits a university lab,  

Chapter 19 | Platform Thinking for Startup Success
182
it can be taken by surprise when it learns how cumbersome such a collaboration 
turns to be. SMEs get the impression that university joint ventures are for big  
companies only, which can absorb inefficiency through sheer scale.
When working in partnership with industry, universities usually take a ­passive 
stance. They answer requests the best they can, by showing visitors what 
they asked to see. Then they overwhelm companies with information and 
details about internal politics, which makes them rather unattractive as equal 
­partners. Better is a leveraged approach. If a research team has founded a 
startup, they should develop themselves to the point that they can use the 
synergies of a joint venture partner to achieve specific milestones in their 
product ­development. When startups meet with established companies, they 
can address those companies directly for specific feedback to improve their 
understanding of the market and ways to interact with it. Such a startup 
brings more to a joint venture than just technology. It is more attractive to 
­partners, who see ways to engage with university startups in a different light. 
Of course, not every presentation will result in a joint venture. But over time, 
the ­university can step out of the position of supplier of inexpensive R&D. 
University startups can present themselves as equal joint venture partners 
and channel know-how about business and the market to the university.
Let’s get back to the earlier example and see how the interaction between 
the startup and the company could have unfolded differently. Assume the team 
around technology X has decided to launch a startup with their intellectual 
property. They have incorporated a company and tested a few theories about 
the value of potential products in the marketplace. One product is promising, 
and they intend to launch it first. They have a lean canvas for several markets as 
well as a financial model, which they improve when new information surfaces. 
They also know what they want from different actors: feedback about their 
product and assumptions, sponsoring of materials to build more prototypes, 
distribution channels, and funding of a precise amount to scale up production. 
A multinational industry giant has read a journal article about technology X.  
The company would like to visit the lab and see the technology and may 
potentially sponsor further development. The company would also like to talk 
about licensing the technology for its own manufacturing processes.
Instead of going through the motions of the standard dog-and-pony show, the 
startup uses this opportunity to collect direct industry feedback about their 
intended first product. Not only do they turn the visit into a testing session, 
but they also engage the potential industry partner with actionable next steps. 
Team lead Professor A has stripped down his PowerPoint presentation. He 
presents the startup in the 10/20/30 format, leaving enough energy and time 
for the Q&A session, which he actively guides toward questions that benefit 
the startup in MVP testing. Some comments from the corporate visitors are 
new to the team. They ask follow-up questions and come up with additional 
ideas for MVPs on the spot. This resourceful method of approaching R&D 

University Startups and Spin-Offs
183
intrigues the company. The startup team also seems advanced in creating a 
marketable product, not just further data about technology X. The subject of 
money never comes up. Companies know that good things have their price; 
when they really need something, the cost is often unimportant.
Let’s say the Q&A has ended. Fresh insights about MVPs and the market have 
emerged. The startup has added several items to its to-do list, which they 
are anxious to test. Because the industry representatives have experience in 
product development, Professor A asks if his team could conduct some testing 
at the company’s lab using its expertise and specialized equipment. The com-
pany would like to discuss this internally and promises to be in touch by the 
end of the week to see whether this is possible. The startup has established a 
connection to the company from a position of strength, not from a position 
where the company has all the money and power and the university is begging 
for funds, hat in hand. If the startup can get access to the company’s equip-
ment and personnel to test the MVP in a realistic environment, they will build 
a stronger bridge to the market and begin to absorb pragmatic know-how 
right then and there.
Instead of waiting for companies to knock on their door, universities should 
also actively seek contact. SMEs are in many regards interesting joint venture 
partners, perhaps much more so than industry leaders and giant corporations. 
A small company can benefit hugely from university R&D. Large corporations 
already have multinational R&D operations, and the thrill of setting one up 
wore off long ago. Universities and their startup teams should seek more con-
tact with SMEs. They should figure out where they can provide the most value 
and bring their intellectual property to market in partnerships.
For this to be effective, they need to streamline the operations of their startups. 
An entrepreneurial mindset must replace that of being a government employee 
with all expenses paid. Startups need to become skillful at presentations. 
Endlessly droning on about features must make way for concise information 
about tangible benefits. Presentations must include real, tested products that 
could launch in the market. The basic assumptions about the startup’s financial 
structure and business model should be clear so they can lead an informed 
discussion, as I addressed in Chapter 8. If startups use this information, they 
are ready to engage companies with attractive value propositions. It is now up 
to universities to enable more conversations with businesses and industry, in 
order to build better channels for a two-way knowledge exchange.
The Investor Visit
Large banks and financial institutions visit universities occasionally. In my native 
Switzerland, the banking sector generously funds universities by sponsoring 
certain infrastructure such as new auditoriums. The American university system 
is dependent on endowments, into which wealthy alumni gift small fortunes. 

Chapter 19 | Platform Thinking for Startup Success
184
It is natural that sponsors want to showcase their donations to clients or 
influential friends. To do this, they ask to set up an event at the university’s 
facilities, which may last a few hours to a day, often comprising a speech from 
the managing director of the university or a visit to a state-of-the-art research 
lab. However, universities often have a mixed opinion about such events.
Let’s see how an investor visit may unfold in the following fictitious ­example. 
A bank has funded an auditorium at a university and would like to ­conduct 
a workshop at the shiny new facility for the college-age children of their  
ultra-high-net-worth clients (UHNWI). The workshop includes a tour of the 
campus and a Q&A lunch with some students, researchers, and the univer-
sity’s management team. The workshop should acquaint the affluent offspring 
with the importance of science and research in today’s society. Because this is 
the third such visit this year, the university reluctantly agrees but states that 
this is the last time it will free up the researchers. The researchers themselves 
have complained about having to give the same presentation repeatedly to 
mostly uninterested rich kids. The workshop takes place and is somewhat 
interesting for the visitors, but not for the university, which just goes through 
the motions. The UHNWI offspring go home and quickly forget about the 
excursion and the workshop—there are many more exciting things taking 
place in their lives, such as a rocket launch in the Mojave Desert, which celeb-
rities such as Sir Richard Branson also attend. In a nutshell, the university 
wasted its time, and the bank feels somewhat unwelcome. Is this a shining 
beacon of platform leverage? You already know the answer.
Here is an alternative scenario. The university’s five startups have all been 
involved in MVP testing and are incrementally developing their products. Some 
venture capitalists have visited, but none have invested, having judged the start-
ups “not ready yet.” The teams have therefore gotten used to making do with 
little or no funding and bootstrapping their way through the product-testing 
phase. When the university announces that a bank will bring by wealthy visi-
tors, the startups see this as an opportunity to gather additional feedback and 
engage the audience with actionable next steps. Knowing that such opportuni-
ties are valuable, the university proposes to formulate the UHNWI workshop 
so it is not about research in today’s society, but about startup entrepreneur-
ship. This will seed the visitors’ minds with entrepreneurial thinking rather than 
yet another request for trickle-down wealth redistribution. The university asks 
the bank to pay for a successful entrepreneur turned billionaire to speak at the 
event as a special guest. This is great for the bank and also for the ­university, 
which is putting on quite a show. The event will be fun for ­university staff, 
the in-house entrepreneurs, and other visitors, such as the government and 
selected industry representatives who are invited to the speech.
Instead of holding lengthy academic presentations, the startups stick to the 
10/20/30 format. Each of the five makes a short presentation during two morning 
sessions. After that, the Q&A takes place, and the startups collect feedback 

University Startups and Spin-Offs
185
about their products—not one by one, but all five together on a panel with 
the special guest. This cross-pollinates the minds of the teams, helps them 
understand how others see what they are doing, and gives them ideas for 
how to approach current challenges from a different angle. The wealthy kids, 
who live an unusual lifestyle, give different feedback than the test subjects the 
teams usually interview. Because the MVP testing is still ongoing, some of 
the visitors volunteer to spend more time with the teams and promise to 
make themselves available for testing and feedback in the future.
The event was a resounding success, the bank asks the university to organize 
further similar events, this time for the parents of the UHNWI children and 
other institutional clients. When that event takes place, the university’s start-
ups will be well on their way to launching products with joint venture partners 
and will need funding to scale up operations. It is a match made in heaven, 
because decision-makers regarding potential funding will be present at that 
next event. Additional synergies may evolve on the spot. But the story is not 
over yet.
One of the workshop attendees boards her private aircraft after the event 
and shuttles off to the Mojave Desert in California to attend a rocket launch. 
Sir Richard Branson, who is by coincidence the young woman’s godfather, asks 
her what she has been up to in the last few days. It is then that Sir Richard 
learns about a biodegradable, rechargeable car battery that is currently being 
developed by a university startup. As it goes at events like these, just to the 
left of Sir Richard stands Elon Musk, founder and CEO of Tesla Motors. He 
overhears the conversation and wants to find out more about that battery. 
Do you think it could be helpful if Branson and Musk talk about your prod-
uct? Pure fiction, you may say. This never happens. Yes, it does. I have been at 
a rocket launch in the Mojave, standing between Sir Richard and Paul Allen, 
cofounder of Microsoft. The net worth of the 50 or so people at that event 
was higher than the GDP of a small country. People discuss this and that at 
such events. Whatever has mindshare with a person at any particular moment 
has a good chance of being talked about. This may as well be your product. If 
it is valuable to a billionaire, he may call you then and there. When that phone 
call comes, startups better be prepared. They may have wondered whether 
they really need that business model canvas, that financial model, and that one-
page proposal—well, this is when those things are needed.
Platform Building Takes Effort
Which of the scenarios discussed here do you think made a bigger impression 
with the bank and its clients? Which scenario do you think is more supportive 
for the university and its startups? The answer is clear. The two scenarios are 
like night and day. However, setting up events like these never happens by 
accident: it requires a conscious effort from the university and its startups.  

Chapter 19 | Platform Thinking for Startup Success
186
It is obviously much easier and safer to go through the motions like any other 
university and to deliver just enough that visiting sponsors are not turned off. 
Of course, universities are not event agencies, and I am not proposing that 
they become one. The examples outlined in this chapter cost nothing more 
than a few good ideas and a mind that is open to turning around the exist-
ing situation. To break away from the pack, management and entrepreneurs 
need to look beyond the obvious recommendations. Once they have begun 
to leverage the existing activities taking place on a university’s platform, they 
will uncover synergies that are right in front of their nose.
Like when you are reading a book about mathematics, it is easy to agree with 
a formula and the result when you see them written down for you. Coming 
up with both yourself is a whole different thing. It is apparent from these 
examples that universities can create huge advantages for their startups by  
taking advantage of existing stakeholders and hidden synergies. But how 
should universities go about raising the bar to engage in more platform think-
ing? Looking at a situation from a fresh angle may steer the university in the 
right direction. An active dialogue about platform thinking may yield ideas 
from the least expected sources.
In addition to these internal efforts, an outside opinion can once more make 
a huge impact. Many successful serial entrepreneurs are open to getting 
involved with universities. Several friends of mine had successful exits from 
their companies and are in a position where they do not have to work to 
pay the bills. Their focus is on making a difference in the world and helping 
entrepreneurs get off the ground. They draw satisfaction from the success 
stories of startups they have mentored. That does not mean they will work 
for free for the university, but their engagement will hardly break the bank.  
The ideas that qualified, motivated mentors can introduce are valuable. Just 
like startups themselves, universities should take advantage of this readily 
available resource if they want to have more success stories with their entre-
preneurship programs.

Leverage Cooperations and Create Network 
Effects
We know that universities can take advantage of their interactions with external 
allies for the good of their startups. They can do this with an innovative ­mindset 
about launching startups and engaging third parties through actionable next 
steps. This chapter describes several initiatives to reroute energy from external 
parties into a university’s startup track. They take place on the existing university 
platform but require a little more time and effort to establish than the actions 
described in Chapter 19.
Communication between universities and external actors creates energy.  
The most important thing is to prevent this energy from escaping unused. To 
do this, universities need to think more like entrepreneurs themselves. They 
should approach third parties as partners for feedback and two-way knowl-
edge exchange. With actionable next steps, universities can move potential 
partners toward the specific milestones the universities want to accomplish 
with their startups. When something falls short of producing the needed 
results, universities need to collect feedback and adjust their approach.
Just as an entrepreneur tries out his MVP with potential clients, a univer-
sity should test its startup platform with its external stakeholders. When it 
does this, students and researchers gain access to an organic ecosystem of 
entrepreneurship. Startups can then draw on unique practical resources and 
knowledge to launch companies with much more momentum.

Entrepreneur-in-Residence Program
There are two definitions of an entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) program. On 
the one hand, it can mean that an experienced technologist has the chance to 
develop a startup as a so-called intrapreneur within a company.1 On the other 
hand, the term describes a situation where an established entrepreneur comes 
into an organization to help with the organization’s own startup initiatives. An 
EIR might also provide expertise to a portfolio company of a venture capital 
firm.2 The entrepreneur may later become part of the portfolio company as a 
full-time executive if both feel there is a good match.
Multinationals and even governments have EIR programs. The Mayor’s Office 
of San Francisco runs its own program “to explore ways [to] use technology 
to make government more accountable, efficient and responsive.”3 Some busi-
ness schools are starting to carry out EIR programs as well. With the goal 
of inviting seasoned entrepreneurs to work with their startups, universities 
can borrow from the playbook of corporate R&D. The main benefit consists 
of bringing entrepreneurial know-how directly into the university to address 
specific startup challenges. As you have seen repeatedly in this book, direct 
access to seasoned entrepreneurs can be a major asset for startups. The 
impact from working hand in hand with an experienced founder trumps any 
workshop or entrepreneurship lecture.
At a university, an EIR program could have several modules, each with a ­different 
entrepreneur (see Figure 20-1). Every founder has their own approach and 
experience, so a rotation brings many facets of startup entrepreneurship to 
light. Each module could last between four weeks and several months, depend-
ing on the university’s resources.

Let’s say there are three modules per year, and during each one a different 
entrepreneur comes in to work with startup teams. The EIR brainstorms 
with the teams, looks at their available assets, and tries new applications and 
combinations. The EIR works with all teams and thus serves as a connec-
tor and catalyst between diverse ideas and markets. When external parties 
visit the university for networking events, the EIR can lead the discussion 
about deeper integration of entrepreneurship to unlock synergies between 
the existing actions on the university platform.
An EIR program can also be the source of excellent media coverage. The uni-
versity anchors its image not only as a research hub but as a center for applied, 
investible innovation, which may be useful when attracting partners from the 
business and financial community.
Universities often have an outstanding reputation as research institutes with 
dormant potential in entrepreneurship and startup success. When they 
­proclaim that they would like to adopt entrepreneurship earlier in their 
­curriculum, they can follow through by jump-starting the process with an EIR 
program. An initial four-week module could launch as a pilot program. This 
pilot serves as the guide for later modules featuring successful entrepreneurs 
from around the world. The risk and cost for the university are minimal. But the 
payoff is massive, especially considering the longer-term value of the program. 
Toward the end of a module, the EIR and the startups can present directly to 
potential joint venture partners and investors in the university’s city.
Even if a module does not directly result in marketable projects or successfully 
funded startups, the relationships and insight gained from the EIR program will 
benefit the university and its students and researchers. They learn firsthand 
how to present projects, assess them, and launch them in the market.
Demo Days
Many ideas from Silicon Valley can be useful for startup programs at universi-
ties. Demo days are just one of them. The seed accelerator Y Combinator 
holds two demo days per year.4 Each startup has seven minutes to make a 
short presentation. One week before the important day, there is a rehearsal 
day when startups can fine-tune their pitches.5
The demo day is a platform where startup founders can present their product 
and business model to venture capital firms that may wish to take them to 
the next step with an investment. Demo days take place at incubators and 
accelerators around the world. Why shouldn’t universities also hold demo 
days with their startups?

Some universities insist that they already have demo days. On closer 
­inspection, those turn out to be little more than relatively passive showcases 
of ­non-investible ideas to a small group of government officials, industry 
representatives, or venture capitalists. Some university showcases I have seen 
consisted of a room full of tables with research props on them: here was a 
3D-printed dish, there a block of cement, and so on. Some of the unmanned 
tables featured tablets with videos about the technology and interviews with 
the researchers. This may be OK for presentations of student work on the 
degree level, but it is a far cry from a serious startup demo day. Without 
professional organization, such events will disappoint. This will confirm the 
notion that entrepreneurship is like a lottery: very difficult and better left to 
others. The staff who organized the showcase will make a mental note that a 
university is not a venture capital firm and go back to business as usual.
As you saw in the examples of platform thinking in Chapter 19, putting startup 
teams in front of decision-makers and seeing what happens does hardly cut 
it. If startups want to succeed, they need to get their act together and engage 
others with attractive value propositions and actionable next steps. Just as on 
a demo day at Y Combinator, pitches must be short and to the point. They 
should follow the 10/20/30 format and should avoid beaming technology fea-
tures at the audience. As the saying goes, when you need friends, it’s too late 
to make them. A demo day that a university puts together out of thin air will 
never attract critical mass and will fail to interest the real decision-makers. 
Startups and universities must be able to draw from a strong entrepreneurial 
network that they should have started to build long before.
Silicon Valley accelerators hold invitation-only demo days as a first opportu-
nity for investors to meet the startups that are part of each intake. These 
are ­full-day events that begin with a breakfast buffet at the accelerator’s 
office. They include a series of short presentations from each of the startups, 
brief demonstrations of technology and products, and networking and Q&A  
sessions with invited industry and customers.
An incubator’s motivation for putting on a demo day is to expose its teams 
to the market and give them an opportunity to collect feedback, network, and 
engage third parties with actionable next steps. If there is a commitment to 
invest in a project, great; but even without it, the demo day itself is a valuable 
field test of ideas.
Because accelerators have excellent connections with industry and investors, 
the demo days are brimming with energy and are usually highlights for entre-
preneurs and attendees. It is less about putting a monetary value on each 
demo day than strengthening the foundation of the startups and the network 
for future events. The accelerator made powerful friends from other venture 
capital, industry, and finance firms before it ever needed them, and now it can 
hand-pick the ones it deems worthwhile to attend the demo day.

University Startups and Spin-Offs
191
In the context of a university, such events can engage research teams with 
the business and financial community and serve as a fact-finding mission for 
business-model generation. Because demo days include all of a university’s 
startups along with university staff not directly involved in entrepreneurship, 
they strengthen entrepreneurial idea exchange within the faculty. By inviting  
potential industrial users of technology developed at the university and poten-
tial joint venture partners, startup teams gather feedback on products, their 
application in the marketplace, and future partnerships. This enables students 
and researchers to leave the building and collect real-world data about the 
viability of their products. The focus is on inclusive listening to feedback and 
opinions, instead of beaming scientific facts at an audience. Such a practice 
speeds up the feedback loop to validate business models for technology devel-
oped at the university. It also teaches startup entrepreneurs what it takes to 
make a good impression and enables them to see how others are approaching 
the same problems they deal with.
To hold a successful demo day, a university needs to have something interest-
ing to demo and relationships with influential partners to demo to. Research 
projects that are not actionable for partners and investors may be interest-
ing to see but miss the purpose of a demo day. It only makes sense to invite 
potential joint venture partners and investors when startups have evolved 
along the path of MVP testing. They should have several business model can-
vases that give a clear idea about their direction, product, and position in the 
market. Their financial model should enable discussion with potential inves-
tors. And startups need to have developed a clear idea of what they want 
from potential partners and investors. One-page proposals should exist at 
least in their minds, if not on paper, so they are ready on demand.
Contacts made at demo days provide superb opportunities for startup teams 
to follow up. If entrepreneurs identify potential clients or joint venture part-
ners, they can now approach them for meetings to move the startup along 
its trajectory.
Employing simple tools used in entrepreneurship hubs can give universities 
an edge with their startup initiatives. Knowing how demo days work puts 
a university on equal footing with top universities worldwide and improves 
its chances to establish long-term collaborations with industry and investors. 
Careful longer-term planning is necessary, as is the case for all initiatives with 
platform thinking. The sooner universities get started, the better.
Integrating Intergovernmental Organizations
Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) are global organizations made up of 
member states. They are created by treaty or charter but are not treaties 
themselves. The North-American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is not an 
organization, but the World Trade Organization (WTO) is. So are the United

Nations (UN), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the 
Asian Development Bank (ADB), and many more.
IGOs typically have a clearly defined mission. The United Nations, for example, 
has the following missions: “To preserve international peace and security, to 
develop friendly relations among nations to achieve international co-operation 
in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humani-
tarian character, and to be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations 
to reach these common ends.”6 As another example, the Asian Development 
Bank has an important mandate: to end extreme poverty in Asia and Pacific.7 
Various publications and diligent research map out strategies for reaching that 
goal. One example is the ADB’s Strategy 2020, which postulates that mem-
ber countries should focus on critical strategic agendas of inclusive economic 
growth, environmental sustainability, and regional integration.8
To make a long story short, many organizations exist with massive funds that 
could help university startups. Some universities in Asia meet with the ADB 
to look into joint projects, but IGOs are still sleeping giants. That is a pity, 
because much university research aims at solving exactly the problems that 
many of these organizations have on their agendas: environmentally sustainable 
growth, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, better urban planning, sustain-
able transport, and many more. Few students and researchers know that the 
ADB has a Sustainable Transport Initiative (STI) with an allocation of 25% of the 
bank’s annual lending (about $10 billion in 2012).9 The STI aims at private sec-
tor development and operations, capacity development, knowledge solutions, 
partnerships, and more.10 Many other programs exist, focusing on water safety 
and renewable energy. What does this mean for university startups? If their 
products address the issues mentioned in these initiatives, they have a direct 
link to IGOs, which may turn out to be powerful partners for startups.
Universities usually approach IGOs with funding requests for individual 
research projects. A typical request for funding is around $250,000. This may 
seem like a lot of money, but it pales compared to the billions of dollars of 
an IGO’s annual budget. Therefore, the economic scale and momentum they 
could bring to startups lie dormant. To change that, universities could try a

new strategy when approaching these organizations. Why not bundle several 
startups together and make them investible as a new project for an IGO? 
How about becoming an implementation partner (not a research partner) 
for an IGO and addressing issues they aim to solve with solutions built with 
technology from the university?
Suppose a university has five startups working on biodegradable battery 
technology, prediction of seismic activity, robotic manufacturing, an electric 
scooter, and a biodegradable glue useful for construction sites. Could they 
align with the ADB’s Strategy 2020 or Sustainable Transport Initiative? I believe 
so. The university would have to present this idea and find out.
Instead of approaching IGOs with a request for funding alone, startups can use 
them as a springboard to finalize their product, gain extra information about 
potential markets, and engage the organization for the next steps. IGOs work 
on the intersection of many different industries and finance, and they see various 
projects every day. They may be able to set powerful network effects in motion. 
What about private investors they work with? What about tenders for which 
startups could put in offers, perhaps together with joint venture partners?
Platform thinking goes a long way. Channeling the energy created on university 
platforms into startups should become a habit. Once it is part of everyday 
business, an entrepreneurial ecosystem will grow. As long as startups have 
a clear roadmap and can keep potential partners interested with good value 
propositions, this ecosystem will be their launch pad.
Presentations for Investors, Funds, and Banks
I have discussed building bridges to the market by engaging companies in joint 
ventures with startups. In the example of an investor visit, I talked about turn-
ing an event for a university sponsor into a great learning and networking 
experience for startups. What I address here involves actively reaching out to 
the financial sector. Except for business schools, universities rarely do this at 
the current time. Private equity funds, hedge funds, venture capital firms, invest-
ment banks, sovereign wealth funds, and all the other players in finance have a 
dubious connotation for many academics. Since the financial crisis of 2007/8, 
the popular press has done its best to slander the sector with stories about 
fraud, excess, and ruthless behavior. A famous example is one popular writer 
branding the American investment bank Goldman Sachs as “Vampire Squid.”11 
This may have hit a nerve with universities, which are by nature risk-averse. 
Reputation risk is the last thing a university wants to burden itself with.

The lack of a connection between universities and the financial sector is 
unfortunate. Various smart academics work in finance, and a wealth of mar-
ket knowledge could flow back to universities if they began engaging those 
individuals. Just like inviting potential joint venture partners and investors to 
a demo day, wealthy individuals and their advisors can be an excellent addi-
tion to a university’s network. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) 
are generally curious about research and science and often support projects 
without an immediate financial return. They are strong allies to raise uncon-
ventional financing even for slightly crazy endeavors such asteroid mining12 
and private space travel.13
Some universities are in ideal positions at the intersection of research, public 
policy, and finance. Singapore, for example, is a melting pot of the world’s wealthi-
est people. Yet there exists a gulf between many of Singapore’s universities and 
the bustling financial sector of the city state. Nonetheless, finance professionals 
and wealthy individuals are open to learning about what is going on at universi-
ties. Knowledge is power, and UHNWIs very much want to have an edge over 
the next guy. Their curiosity could be the spark to ignite their engagement in 
a university’s startup track. They could be ideal candidates to ask for feedback 
about products and business models. Not only do they bring financial firepower 
to the table, but their experiences and networks are also attractive for startups. 
With clearer deliverables for investible, validated startups, universities can take 
a leadership role in bridging the gap with the financial community.
Whenever I bring this up with startup teams, they say they will get financial 
connections later, when they need funding. However, that misses the point 
entirely. Entrepreneurs should have a robust network before they ever need 
anything. They can engage the financial community today as a sounding board 
for their business and financial model and collect feedback from them along the 
way. When the entrepreneurs need funding down the road, they can approach 
those members of the financial community as existing contacts. Asking for an 
introduction to a venture capital firm will be easier then.
Few people have a deca-millionaire in their group of friends, let alone a billion-
aire. When they finally meet one, they are surprised how normal and likable 
that person is. Of course they are (most of them); how else could they have 
interested enough people to buy their products or services, which made them 
rich in the first place?
But what about the evil private equity funds, the vampire squids, the arro-
gant hedge-fund managers, and the insensitive venture capitalists? Surely you 
don’t want to deal with them? Granted, there may be unpleasant characters at 
certain financial outfits. Some of them, usually lower-level employees, can be

summed up as having “one inch of power”: this means they have climbed the 
ladder just high enough to have an inflated ego. This is hardly who you want to 
do business with. As soon as you get higher up the chain of command at funds 
and financial institutions, things get interesting. Believe it or not, getting to the 
top in finance requires entrepreneurial thinking. Decision-makers at funds and 
financial institutions feel at ease with other entrepreneurial, unconventional 
types. Many of their investments are bets on special situations, unexpected 
economic developments, market shifts, and geopolitical changes that influence 
the product line of startups. They can contribute considerable pragmatic 
advice to startup teams and their evolution.
Stop thinking about an investment fund as a casino, and see it as an entre-
preneurial think tank. Stop thinking about wealthy individuals as people who 
deprived someone else of their fair share, and view them as hard-working folks 
who once were and still may be entrepreneurs. UHNWIs live a life of very few 
constraints. That opens up the mind. Stop thinking in terms of entitlement—it 
is not the duty of wealthy people to give you money. Assume responsibility for 
all your actions, because nobody owes you anything. The sooner you adopt 
this mindset, the better. A new world will open up to you. A startup may be 
the vehicle that will shift your thinking in this direction.
By now, you may have noticed that all these platform initiatives involve the 
same deliverables: creating benefit-centered, investible startups; validating 
hypotheses about products and the market; adapting communications to be 
more inclusive for non-academics; and engaging third parties with actionable 
next steps. All of these should be at the top of the agenda for universities 
and their startups. You may have also noticed that these initiatives require 
the same effort on the part of the university and the startup: keeping an 
open mind, engaging third parties early, asking them for feedback about your 
­products and processes, and including them in your entrepreneurial network.
Once universities have adopted platform thinking as a whole, many startup 
initiatives can launch with little extra effort, because they build on each other. 
The key is to take the first step and look for leverage. After you have carried 
out the first platform project, the next one will be much easier. With platform 
projects, your university has the opportunity to transform itself. It just has not 
tried hard enough yet.
An Investment Fund as the Master Platform
A final idea is creating a university-led investment fund. I know, red flags go 
up immediately. The university is no investment bank, and certainly it is not a 
hedge fund. It does not have any interest in short-term gains; only long-term 
scientific excellence matters. I have heard all these objections before. I under-
stand them and agree with them. However, they largely stem from misunder-
standing the intentions behind the recommendations in this part of the book. 

Chapter 20 | More Platform Projects

If you take these ideas out of context, I admit that some of them may sound 
strange. It is the underlying logic that makes the difference. Universities should 
keep an open mind and look for unorthodox ways to build and strengthen 
their entrepreneurial platform. They should reach out to as many companies 
as possible to enable entrepreneurial knowledge transfer back to the university. 
Invariably, this includes some unconventional ideas. If you can be enterprising 
and receptive, you will make the most of this book.
Ideas about finance are sometimes difficult to understand and often down-
right scary for those outside the financial sector. Besides, embracing capitalism 
is rarely a strong point of academics. Whatever your personal convictions, 
nobody asks you to convert to capitalism. This is about launching projects to 
engage third parties for the good of a university’s startup program. Financial 
institutions are such third parties. So are UHNWIs, insurance companies, and 
IGOs such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. If interaction 
with those financial stakeholders makes sense, then an investment fund could 
be the master vehicle to unify all the platform projects described in this chapter. 
Let’s examine how universities can do this.
A team around Professor Andrew Lo of MIT popularized the idea of a mega 
fund to commercialize research. They published a paper in Nature Biotechnology 
that suggested pooling several biomedical research projects aimed at healing 
cancer into a multibillion-dollar investment fund.14 Without going into too 
much detail, the following paragraph describes how this works.
The risk of investing in an individual biomedical research project is high. The 
entire investment can be lost. But if the project proves to be successful, its 
payoff is enormous, perhaps 100 times the investment or more. A diversified 
stock portfolio invested in several stocks is less risky than investing all your 
money in one stock. With the same logic, building a mega fund that invests in 
several biomedical research projects is safer than one large investment in an 
individual project. With relatively simple financial engineering, Lo showed that 
a mega fund could achieve returns of 5% or more with relatively low risk. The 
individual projects did not change, just the way the fund structured them and 
made them investible.
This approach has the power to attract a large group of institutional and 
­private investors who would never dream of investing in individual drug- 
discovery projects. However, because the fund diversifies away much of the 
risk, they may be open to investing in a mega fund if it existed. Put another 
way, such a fund is comparable to investments they already know and invest in

Research through Securitization Techniques,” Nature Biotechnology 30, no. 10 (2012).

197
with good results. With this reasoning, an ocean of new capital would become 
available to finance biomedical research, and the extra capital could speed up 
discovery of new drugs.
This sounds intriguing. The same approach could work for research projects 
and university startups in general. However, most universities oppose ideas 
along those lines. Financial engineering is anathema for many academics and 
public servants. Yet private and institutional investors are allocating billions of 
dollars to comparable investments and often struggle to find a market deep 
enough to absorb all the liquidity available. Market demand from financial inves-
tors exists. With relatively low risk, a university could take the lead and spear-
head the first investment fund made up of research projects and promising 
startups.
Of course, this would not be a slush fund to finance university overhead. It 
would not be “free money” like the government funding and donations that 
many universities receive now. Nevertheless, it would compare to a venture 
capital investment in exchange for equity or debt in a startup. In this light, it 
becomes obvious that little would change for the startups and the university. 
The upside is the fact that they would have a source of funding available from 
inside the university. Other than purely monetary benefits, the fund would 
serve as a master platform with network effects for all parties. As an inter-
disciplinary vehicle, it would occupy a position at the intersection of science, 
international business, and finance. Because it would be a market-oriented 
investment fund (not a think tank), interactions and communications on this 
platform would have urgency and would need to be action-oriented. This 
would break the habit of endless deliberation before making moves in the real 
world. An investment fund could be rocket fuel for university startups.
Example: Venture Capital vs. Mega Fund
Suppose a university has the five startups mentioned earlier. Their areas of 
expertise are biodegradable batteries, prediction of seismic activity, robotic 
manufacturing, an electric scooter, and a glue for construction. Assume that 
these startups have progressed through their MVP testing and launched a first 
product in the market with good feedback. Each startup has landed a joint 
venture partner that holds 51% of the venture; 44% is held by the research 
team and 5% by the university. The joint venture partner covers all overhead 
of the startup, so there is no immediate need to raise capital to make ends 
meet. The joint ventures have validated their products and are now refining 
production to cut costs. Several venture capital firms have approached each 
startup, offering $1 million to buy a 20% stake in the company (each company 
is valued at $5 million). Let’s see what happens if the startups take that offer. 
The capitalization table of the startup changes as shown in Table 20-1.

198
As you learned previously, venture capital looks great on paper, but it comes 
with strings attached. The relationship is a tradeoff. The startup receives cash 
and access to the resources and know-how of the VC firm. But it also has 
to consider the corporate interests of the new investor, which may conflict 
with those of the startup and the university when they have to meet certain 
milestones. VCs can and do veto startup team decisions. They invest other 
people’s money, so they have to answer to their shareholders. These may 
complain if returns from the investment in this particular joint venture fall 
short of expectations. And that is where the trouble starts.
A venture capitalist is a bit like a rich uncle who funds your college tuition, only 
to feel entitled later to meddle in every decision of your life. When startups 
need funds, venture capital may be grand. However, if a startup has another 
source of funding available, that may be even better. Who or what could this 
other source be? No bank will invest a million dollars in a company with little 
or no revenue, regardless of its joint venture partner. But if you had 100 com-
panies, the story might be different. Just as with the mega fund, investing in many 
diverse assets is less risky than investing a large sum in a single asset. If univer-
sities structured their startup companies this way, the investment risk would 
decrease, and they might gain access to additional sources to raise capital.
In Table 20-1, you see that an investment in a company is a straightforward 
transaction. Where the investment comes from has no impact on the transac-
tion. I said it before: investment in a startup is not a question of money alone. 
If a venture capital firm supports a startup with positive synergies, it can add a 
lot. But if it begins pushing the startup in a direction the entrepreneurs dislike, 
then other sources of capital would have been a better choice.

Impact Investment
Before I discuss how to put together such a fund, let’s first look at a recent trend 
in finance called impact investment.15 (This differs from the slightly more settled 
socially responsible investment [SRI], which seeks to minimize negative effects 
rather than proactively create positive social change or environmental impact.) 
Investors forgo a small portion of returns to ensure that the projects they invest 
in make a difference. They should have a positive social impact or must be good 
for the environment. An example may be micro loans made by a bank in a 
developing country, which could raise $100 million from impact investors. The 
loan fund is rated by a renowned rating agency and syndicated on commercial 
terms among institutional investors, such as pension funds, in Europe and the 
United States. This investment yields financial returns and has a positive impact 
on society by making micro loans available for entrepreneurs in a developing 
country. However, impact investments also make sense in the developed world. 
For example, they may focus on sustainable energy or social causes.
Such investments produce an acceptable return, but it may be slightly lower 
than that of a conventional financial product like a corporate bond. Other 
popular applications of impact investing are clean technology, public health, 
job creation, community development, and more. J.P. Morgan predicts that the 
impact investing market has the potential to reach $1 trillion of invested capi-
tal by 2020, with profits of up to $667 billion.16 This is not a blip on the radar, 
but a trend on the horizon.
Let’s go back to our five university startups. Would investments in these start-
ups qualify as impact investments? Possibly, if they are businesses with the 
intent of making a positive social or environmental impact. The emphasis is on 
business, meaning a startup cannot simply be a PhD project with no other goal 
than the PhD getting tenure at a university. These must be serious companies 
with proven market demand for their products. It must be credible that they 
will earn revenues sometime in the future. And their teams must have the 
motivation to go the distance.
To clarify, imagine the following fictitious example. The electric scooter startup 
has devised a socially responsible business model. Factories of a joint venture 
partner located in rural communities in a developing country produce the 
scooters from recycled material. The scooters sell for a high price in devel-
oped countries. This allows the company to pay employees a higher wage 
and offer free education and entrepreneurship workshops for their families.

The Asian Development Bank has decided the startup is in line with its Strategy 
2020, aimed at reducing poverty in Asia.17 It has therefore invested on generous 
terms that allow the startup to build several schools in the community. To 
open factories in additional communities, the startup is now raising more 
capital from impact investors. Because it makes a positive impact in the com-
munities and is a force for social change, it qualifies as an impact investment.
When you get into the complexity associated with platform thinking, it should 
be clear that it makes sense only for serious, honest efforts of dedicated, 
­motivated entrepreneurs. When startups have gone through the process 
of lean development and have identified strong demand for their product, 
they have taken the first step. As soon as they have attracted a joint venture 
­partner with a mutually beneficial value proposition, they are one step further. 
Once they have revenue and a credible growth strategy, they are respectable 
businesses that could qualify as an investment by a fund.
Benefits of an Investment Fund
Within this investment fund, all the platform projects described in this chapter 
come together. The entrepreneur-in-residence program now takes place on the 
level of the fund. An EIR works with portfolio companies and is in contact with 
interesting stakeholders on the fund platform. Demo days showcase not only 
individual startups, but also portfolio companies and their potential projects, to 
attract new investors to the fund. IGOs may also take part on a larger scale; an 
impact investment fund is a more promising vehicle for them than an individual 
small project. And finally, the discussion with the financial sector takes place on 
equal footing. The financial community is no longer a donor but an investor.
This new model of knowledge exchange and interaction has many benefits:
Action-oriented knowledge exchange with SMEs and 
• 
multinational corporations
Action-oriented knowledge exchange with large organi-
• 
zations such as IGOs, governments, NGOs, and industry 
organizations
Better chance for startups to enter into equal joint  
• 
ventures with companies
Potential access to investment capital, if startups and  
• 
spin-offs pass due diligence
Being part of a bold initiative to enable research to make 
• 
a bigger measurable impact

This fund would be the ideal master platform for a university to fully engage all 
available synergies. It could effectively channel energy into launching startups. 
When this happens, those startups have the power to reach escape velocity 
much faster.
In theory, this approach holds much promise for university startups. My 
­personal discussions with investment bankers and private equity firms have 
shown that interest from the financial sector exists for such an instrument. 
Given that sustainable investment and impact investment are growing in impor-
tance each year, many university startups align with the goals of ­investors once 
they achieve traction in the market. These are all favorable developments that 
make the case that such a fund could take off.
However, in reality, setting up a fund in the current university structure would 
not be a cakewalk. Universities are unprepared to deal with investment capital, 
because they are not-for-profit entities, funded by the government. As with all 
entrepreneurship initiatives, many incumbents at the university would fear the 
changes that these new ideas bring to their doorstep. The terms “structured 
finance” and “financial engineering” scare and upset them, and they have no 
interest in working with private equity firms and investment bankers. There 
would be major debates about the principles necessary before a new entity 
within the university could start setting up the fund. The university would 
have to hire financial staff to put together the fund and manage its assets. 
Questions about liability and reputation risk would need answers. All this 
takes patience and time.
Of course, no university wants to be the first to launch a fund with the risk of 
a total loss for all investors a few years down the road. But when somebody 
cracks these issues and launches the first successful research-backed invest-
ment fund, it will open the door for universities to follow. They will be able 
to access large new sources of financing that infuse their startups with rocket 
fuel. Network effects will kick in. Students and researchers will realize early 
in their university career that a startup is an alternative. They will see that it 
is possible because many before them have launched startups that made an 
impact in the real world. Young founders will tap into the new ­entrepreneurial 
ecosystem of their university, their startup alumni networks, mentors, and 
platform projects. It will be a brave new world for startup entrepreneurship. 
Until that happens, much work is necessary.
There is a silver lining on the horizon, and universities have started to take 
the first steps. I wish them the courage to keep going and to realize their own 
entrepreneurial ambitions and those of their students and researchers.

Additional 
Considerations
The following articles and resources are related to startup entrepreneurship 
but go beyond the practical steps presented in this book so far. Sometimes 
a single sentence can bring about the solution to a specific problem you are 
wrestling with. Who knows? Perhaps you’ll find this sentence somewhere in 
this appendix.
How Your Startup Could Make a Billion 
Dollars
Most entrepreneurs say money is not a motivation for them. I believe this is 
true. Financial reward alone is insufficient to instill in you the entrepreneurial 
fire that will push you forward in rough times. A paycheck will motivate you 
enough to complete a certain task and then leave the office at five o’clock, 
but you will rarely compete on a global scale this way. At the same time, 
it would be nice if your entrepreneurial efforts paid off as well. If you have 
been working 100-hour weeks for several years without much to show for 
it, you will undoubtedly ask yourself if this is worth doing. If you have a PhD, 
you will wonder whether your friends who took cushy jobs at a university 
or consultancy made the better choice. In such cases, you may briefly think 
of other entrepreneurs for whom such toil paid off handsomely. The prime

example is Mark Zuckerberg, who is now worth about $28 billion.1 Many 
others exist, and not only in the tech space. How did they get there? Which 
forces did they leverage to attract such massive wealth? Here is an attempt 
at an explanation.
Overcome Social Norms
Mark Zuckerberg earned about $3 billion on average each year over the last 
ten years. Is this possible by playing nice, obeying all the rules, and making 
many friends along the way? Author Martin Fridson finds that the two primary 
obstacles to amassing a billion-dollar fortune are the menace of competition 
and the obstacle of social conventions. To enter the billion-dollar club, entre-
preneurs must overcome market forces and conventional wisdom. Walmart 
founder Sam Walton violated the age-old convention of cordial relationships 
with sellers. He went around the wholesalers and bought directly from manu-
facturers. Not only this, but Walton publicly stated that he stole all his good 
ideas from competitors. He broke the social norms expected of a business 
person, and Walmart pulled away from the pack.2
Social conventions come in many forms. They often brand becoming wealthy 
as a crime. Ask anyone if they believe it is ethical to travel by private jet. They 
may consider this snobbish and wasteful, which is the expected answer that 
most people are comfortable with. But will being compatible with the major-
ity help you if your goal is a billion-dollar company? You will never be able to 
attract this kind of money with conventional wisdom. This is by no means a 
value judgment about people’s personal opinions, just a simple statement of 
the mindset needed to earn a massive fortune.
Do Something Old, and Do It Better
Many startup entrepreneurs think they have to do something no one else 
has ever done before. They believe that success comes down to creating an 
entirely new product that serves a new market. Coming up with a disruptive 
invention may be one path to a billion-dollar company. But Twitter founder 
Evan Williams disagrees. He believes that success comes down to fulfilling 
age-old needs, but in a better way. In a speech, he mentioned the example

of car-sharing service Uber, which is valued at $18 billion at the time of this 
writing.3 The need to get from A to B is by no means original, yet the popular 
app manages to connect passengers and drivers more effectively. Compared 
to hailing a cab the old-fashioned way, Uber took out several steps in the 
process and streamlined the experience. In Williams’ view, the Internet is just 
a machine that gives people what they want. Instead of a utopian world, it is 
simply a tool to do old things in a better way.4
Create Frictionless Markets
Software, technology, and automation have removed much friction from 
processes that were previously cumbersome. Authors Eric Brynjolffson and 
Andrew McAfee find that the most radical progress in robotics and 3D print-
ing happened in the last few years, after a frustratingly long period of slow 
development. The advances are opening the door to near-frictionless markets 
in various applications that were previously safe from automation. The authors 
point toward middle-class jobs like medical diagnostics and low-skilled manual 
labor like picking fruit, which computers and robots could soon automate 
away.5 Technology reduces inefficiencies and cost, and increases transparency. 
The same goes for the rapid digitization that is taking place today. Sharing digi-
tal files is much easier than distributing physical product. This happens online, 
where file sharing disrupted the music industry to the core. The communi-
cation industry also took a hit: worldwide video conferencing is now freely 
available to anyone through Skype. When technology takes over, network 
effects kick in, and change speeds up even more. This allows the newly emerg-
ing frictionless market to produce more profits than the market it replaced  
(see Figure A-1).

If your company replaces established processes with new technology, it could 
potentially earn billion-dollar revenues. Timing is obviously crucial, because 
the old market may be too powerful to suppress the new technology, or 
people may be unwilling to give up their established habits. The technology 
may also still be on the flat part of the curve, not yet ready to deliver the 
promised gains in efficiency. But when you hit the right entry point to launch 
a disruptive product in the market just where the exponential curve takes off, 
then chances are high you will succeed. Hitting this ideal entry point is prob-
ably more an art than a science, and it is easy to spot in hindsight.
Ride the Market Expansion in a Subsector
Addressing an existing market and riding its current growth rate has a small 
chance of making you a billion dollars over night. It may allow your company 
to become profitable over a long period of time. But unconventional returns 
require massive leverage. Author and venture capitalist Damir Perge reminds 
us that in certain subsectors of an existing market, the rate of change is much 
higher than in the main market. Just like in frictionless markets, if you catch the 
right entry point, your company can surf a large expansion of that subsector, 
which happens very quickly.
Compare the social media sector with the mobile social media sector, which 
has witnessed an explosion in the past two years. Social media grew rap-
idly, but the newly emerging subsector grew much faster.6 An example is the 
mobile social messaging app WhatsApp, which Facebook bought in 2012 for 
$19 billion in cash and stock.7

Tesla Motors is another example. After becoming an innovator in the hybrid 
automobile sector, a subsector of the automobile industry, the company went 
public and now has a market cap of close to $30 billion (Q3, 2014).8 Riding the

If your product exists in an established market but serves a newly emerging 
subcategory of the existing base of customers, then explosive growth is pos-
sible. This is incredibly hard to engineer and plan but always easy to explain in 
retrospect. One thing is certain, though: if you find out your product serves a 
declining established market, then the chance for explosive growth is small.
Take Advantage of Disruption
A common case of market disruption takes place when governments privatize 
certain sectors. After the Cold War, the energy industry in Russia under-
went rapid privatization, in the process minting many billionaires. Legitimate 
or not, the privatization process explains how immense wealth can flow to a 
single person. Whenever a legacy market becomes stale and inefficient, after 
a sustained decline in profitability, new players come in through deregulation 
or privatization. These new players introduce free-market thinking into the 
former state-owned enterprise and bring it back up to speed. The follow-
ing recovery of the market is profitable. Market A in Figure A-3 serves as an 
example.

A crash is another example of market disruption (market B in Figure A-3). 
Prominent market crashes occurred at the beginning of the Great Depression 
in 1929, the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and the global financial crisis in 
2007/8. In a market crash, a fire sale of distressed assets takes place. Newly 
available assets often look unattractive at first sight, because they are run-
down, deep in debt, or otherwise considered worthless. However, what could 
be easier than buying an asset that nobody wants, and later selling it when 
everybody is clamoring for it? Not every disruption scheme ends in billion-
dollar success. But it is a mechanism that has enough leverage to enable it. 
Anyone with sufficient courage and liquid funds can potentially buy low and 
sell high when a market crash occurs. If they pick the right assets and play it 
smart, they make headlines and the Forbes list a few years later.
Launching a startup in times of crisis is a good strategy. If the venture is agile, 
it can take advantage of market disruption and inexpensive assets in the crash. 
While everybody else is scrambling to keep their existing operations running, 
startup entrepreneurs can build theirs from the ground up. They can incorpo-
rate lean principles and low overhead into the company from day one. When 
the economy inevitably picks up again, they are in an ideal position to reap the 
rewards with high profit margins.
These concepts explain only a few of the mechanics that underlie billionaire 
wealth. It is obvious that becoming a billionaire is no small feat. These exam-
ples make it apparent that there is much more to it than working hard and 
paying your dues. Most of all, achieving massive success forces you to become 
an extreme individual. A group thinker has never achieved great wealth. Nor 
has someone too concerned with what others think about them. Making up 
your mind to become successful and super-rich subordinates all else. Whether 
this is advisable is another question. It requires intense focus that dominates 
your entire life. This will inevitably alienate some of your old friends, and it will 
make you a target for envy and ridicule—until, of course, you have achieved 
your goal.

Where Does Entrepreneurial Success  
Come From?
What primes startups for success is a matter of heated debate. There is obvi-
ously no sure-fire recipe, no ten-step plan that makes a fledgling venture the 
next Google. Here are some thoughts about what may cause a startup to 
gravitate toward success or failure. This may be helpful for entrepreneurs, 
universities, and investors alike.
On their journey, successful entrepreneurs need three main ingredients as 
fuel in their tank: a wild idea, bold execution, and persistence. These three 
ingredients combined make or break the project. By a wild idea, I mean a 
slightly controversial hypothesis. If the idea is so mainstream that everyone 
will accept it, then chances are high that someone else is already working on it. 
As explained by author Derek Sivers, a brilliant idea with weak execution may 
still yield profits, as may a weak idea with strong execution.9 To find a super-
star, all three ingredients have to be of top pedigree. The quality of execution 
and persistence are in turn influenced by an entrepreneur’s decisions about 
how to approach them. As illustrated in Figure A-4, these decisions can be 
good (light gray dots) or bad (black dots), and they influence execution and 
persistence.

Project, 2011).

Once an entrepreneur has an idea, they must transform it into reality. This is 
where execution and persistence come in. Startup success often boils down 
to why and how founders do something, rather than what they are doing. This 
book has addressed the what sufficiently up to this point. Instead of locking 
onto the words execution and persistence, let’s examine the forces that influ-
ence them (the how and why).
Success Parameters
Startups move along a so-called J-curve, where we expect a return on invest-
ment down the road after early losses. The pace at which they move along 
the x-axis depends on a tug-of-war between the entrepreneurs’ good and 
bad decisions (along the large arrows in Figure A-5). As described by author 
Jeff Olson, a series of small good decisions, followed up persistently, will 
yield good results in the long term, whereas small bad decisions, followed up  
persistently, will yield weak results.10

Every entrepreneur and investor will of course prefer good decisions, which  
I believe are a result of the following underlying factors: strong intrinsic moti-
vation, an open mind, and a can-do attitude. What exactly does this mean?

(Atlanta: Success Books, 2005).

Strong Intrinsic Motivation 
In contrast to extrinsic motivation, where external factors like reward and 
punishment are the driving forces behind taking action, intrinsic motivation 
comes from within a person. It is a burning desire to reach a goal, no matter 
what it takes. There is a difference between wanting to succeed and committing  
yourself to success. If you have the motivation to achieve a goal, there is no 
reason you cannot make it happen. A desire to prove yourself or a competitive  
drive for excellence may push you to aim for the gold. Entrepreneurs give 
themselves every reason to get up in the morning. The desire to do and 
achieve always trumps a feeling of obligation or fear.
An Open Mind 
Invariably, a startup will encounter roadblocks. The technology on which the 
main idea builds may flounder. There may be legal hassles, or blatant flaws in 
the original business model may emerge after you work on your startup for a 
while. To admit you were wrong and to change your mind is easier said than 
done, because most humans feel they must be consistent with whatever rules 
they have set up for themselves. But this is definitely not the case for a suc-
cessful entrepreneur: if the entrepreneur has a change of heart, pivoting will 
move the startup forward. Resisting the pivot will set the startup on a negative 
trajectory. Keeping an open mind will allow you to look past conventions and 
strict rules. You will see what others don’t. If you can only get there with a 
pivot, then embrace it despite conventions or prior commitments.
Can-Do Attitude
This is the entrepreneur’s hallmark. Strongly related to keeping an open mind, 
the can-do attitude takes it one step further. Suppose an employee has vol-
unteered to do a task over the weekend and shows up on Monday with the 
task uncompleted. The excuse is that he really tried but simply could not finish. 
This is such a normal event in most organizations that it may not even register. 
However, this mindset is incompatible with startups and entrepreneurship. 
“No” means “maybe,” and “maybe” means “yes”: that is the way entrepreneurs 
approach things. If you have been an employee, then this shift may not come 
naturally. You must take full responsibility for all your actions. Henry Ford 
knew that “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t—you’re right.” 
You are thinking anyway, so it is better to think you can.
Some of these success factors may seem impractical to you on first sight. 
Nevertheless, be aware that entrepreneurs compete with other entrepre-
neurs, not with other employees, and not with other university students or 
researchers. The two worlds require different mindsets to succeed.

212
Regardless, even if you follow the recommendations for the three success 
factors, there are still roadblocks that can prevent success from taking place. 
You must avoid those. What puts the brakes on startup success? Financial 
desperation, analysis paralysis, and a can’t-do attitude.
Financial Desperation
As you already know, intrinsic motivation always trumps extrinsic motivation. 
If you desperately need to earn an income fast, this may be to the disadvantage 
of your startup. When you have heavy impending overhead or debt payments, 
you should find a high-paying job and follow entrepreneurship on the side. The 
same goes for partnering with co-founders: if one of them has money woes, 
stay clear. This advice may not sound sensible, but ignoring it has led to trouble 
for many founders.
A startup needs considerable goodwill along the way to succeed. There is 
of course nothing wrong with following a profitable idea just for the sake of 
profit. But if a founder displays money-mindedness as their leading motivation, 
this will alienate honest backers and attract people with questionable motives. 
Here is a simple rule: only if you would trade places with somebody, ask them 
for advice or work with them. Those with money woes will automatically fall 
through this screen.
Analysis Paralysis
Especially in academic circles, analysis paralysis runs rampant. Have you already 
spent so much time analyzing a situation that you have lost sight of what to 
do next? How many more PowerPoint presentations and data visualizations 
do you need to convince yourself and take action? Academics often confuse 
a startup with a thought experiment. However, entrepreneurship has little to 
do with writing an academic paper, where at the end of the process a group of 
experts either approvingly nod or reject the idea. Startups are often irrational 
endeavors whose fate is decided by volatile market forces, not all-knowing 
gatekeepers.
Most worthwhile ideas were at some point rejected by experts. If you must 
convince others, then let them be people on the same wavelength as you. If 
you lack conviction and feel you must convince yourself to the degree that 
it hampers your ability to take action, then check whether you are really on 
board with the idea. You may find that you hold doubts about it that prevent 
you from moving along. However, if your environment has dragged you into a 
negative feedback loop, read the next point.

University Startups and Spin-Offs
213
Can’t-Do Attitude
If you think it cannot be done, then you will prove yourself and your peers 
right. This belief may have grown in you over the years. Be aware that it is 
hard to thrive as an entrepreneur in an unsupportive environment. Influence 
is a subtle process: peers are rarely outright hostile. Slight criticism, a raised 
eyebrow, or a smug remark here and there when you speak about your ideas 
can have enough cumulative abrasive force over the years to grind away your 
entrepreneurial spirit. This happens without your knowing it. Be selective 
about your associations, and make sure they are encouraging and positive.
If a startup begins working on a wild idea and follows up with strong execu-
tion and dogged persistence, the main ingredients for success are in place. If 
an entrepreneur repeatedly makes good decisions, the gears are set in motion 
to reach escape velocity. To understand how the entrepreneur is thinking, find 
out whether they display a strong intrinsic motivation to make the idea suc-
ceed, an open mind to pivot when necessary, and a can-do attitude to combat 
adversity. Look at factors that may hamper success: whether there are extrin-
sic motivators that are misaligned with entrepreneurship, a lack of conviction 
to run with the idea, or a negative attitude that turns the entrepreneur into 
their own worst enemy.
Use this checklist to assess your own situation. Also be aware that venture 
capitalists look at similar factors to assess you and your idea. Of course, mak-
ing better decisions is desirable for more than just startup success. If you can 
enable positive forces in your life that automatically guide you toward making 
better decisions, both you and your startup will be happier.
Stop Pitching Ideas
In the past, I have heard pitches of “the next big disruptive idea,” “the future 
of social networking,” and an idea “ten times better than Facebook” (seri-
ously, I am not making this up). Entrepreneurs seek to attract capital with 
these claims (venture capital or angel funding), to make their projects reality. 
The point they often miss is that pitching ideas is a waste of time and a huge 
turnoff to experienced investors. Pitches may be amusing, but they can shut 
investors’ doors before the first MVP has been tested.
By pitching ideas I do not mean talking about a fresh idea with a friend and ask-
ing for their feedback. I mean the belief that an idea alone is enough to attract 
investment. You learned throughout this book what it takes to engage third 
parties with confirmed value propositions. If you stick to what this book sug-
gests you do, you will never feel compelled to pitch ideas.

During the dot.com boom ten years ago, the story was a little different: getting 
an online presence required making an upfront investment in server infra-
structure, paying database license fees, and hiring an experienced staff that was 
hard to find. The initial costs of an Internet startup could amount to $1 million.  
Luckily, we face an entirely different reality today: cloud and scalable VPS host-
ing, even designated servers, can be had for less than $100 per month. CMSs 
and databases are a dime a dozen; most businesses can pick from a wide 
offering of free open source or inexpensive solutions. Relevant experience 
is also much easier to find: basic coding and front-end user experience are 
simple with WYSIWYG and widget programming. Job fairs like elance.com 
and odesk.com offer competitive skills for hire. Rapid prototyping is quickly 
becoming the norm, with workable prototypes available for less than $50.
We talked about the importance of the minimum viable product throughout 
this book. If you are an entrepreneur, you need a prototype today. If you are 
still pitching ideas to attract investment, no matter how sophisticated your 
pitch deck and the financials look, it will be hard to obtain funding. More 
important than putting together that killer presentation is getting started and 
leaving the building to test your hypothesis in the market. Once you have a 
couple of prospective clients for your product, you can begin to iterate, tweak, 
and jumpstart grassroots marketing efforts. It is not rocket science to put an 
idea on the ground and test it, and investors want to see entrepreneurs do 
exactly that.
Expertise Is the New Venture Capital
Because almost no investment is required to found a startup, it has become 
more critical for young companies to focus on finding advice about prod-
uct development, scalability, and marketing. An experienced entrepreneur or 
investor can provide you with a professional network. This is usually more 
important than funding. If your MVP shows initial traction, you have much 
more leverage to attract qualified advice. To come across as a doer, not a 
talker, you must prove you can deliver. And when you do that, you are no 
longer pitching ideas. Only then can you engage others to get on board with 
you who can help your startup.
Why You Cannot Replicate Silicon Valley
Silicon Valley is the nickname for Santa Clara Valley, the South Bay portion of 
the San Francisco Bay area in northern California. In the last years, the term 
has become a synonym for innovation. Research parks often dream out loud 
of copying Silicon Valley. Occasionally, someone makes the mistake of publicly 
declaring that they will take it on head to head, only to silently fade into obliv-
ion a few short years later. Moscow’s Skolkovo innovation center is a ­legendary 

University Startups and Spin-Offs
215
example. Billions of rubles flowed into an entrepreneurship and research hub 
dubbed the “Silicon Valley of Moscow,” with little certainty of success.11
Even the residents of Silicon Valley struggle to explain how its success came 
about. According to author Deborah Perry Piscione, we have to go back to 
the year 1884, when Leland Stanford thought about what a university in his 
son’s honor could look like. Piscione goes on to explain several ingredients of 
the success story that is Silicon Valley.12 Let’s look at some of them and exam-
ine the three main building blocks that made Silicon Valley what it is today.
Stanford University, the “MIT of the West”
Stanford University, located in the north part of the valley, has been one of 
its defining elements. Its founder, Leland Stanford, insisted that “science pro-
vide direct usefulness in life,” which put the university in a league of its own. 
Stanford now runs its own industrial park, which over 150 companies call 
home. Most other universities ignored the relevance of science at the time, 
and, unfortunately, not much has changed in the meantime.
After World War I, the U.S. military granted $450 million (in 1945 dollars) to 
weapons R&D. Several universities on the East Coast (such as Harvard and MIT) 
shared this money. But only $50,000 found its way to Stanford University, which 
at the time lacked the reputation of being a credible research center. Frederick 
Terman, then Stanford’s chair of engineering, felt so personally offended that 
he vowed to recruit away from East Coast universities the best research talent 
available. He transformed Stanford into the “MIT of the West,” as author Steve 
Blank puts it. When the Cold War intensified after 1950, Stanford University 
became a full partner with the military, the CIA, and the NSA.
Stanford researchers routinely work with industry as paid consultants. This 
not only ensures that the latest technological know-how finds its way into 
the market, but also channels insight about business and industry trends back 
to students and researchers. So far, the university has spawned more than 
6,000 companies.13 Some of them include Charles Schwab & Company, Cisco 
Systems, Dolby Laboratories, eBay, E*Trade, Electronic Arts, Gap, Google, 
Hewlett-Packard, IDEO, Intuit, LinkedIn, Logitech, MathWorks, Netflix, Nike, 
NVIDIA, Odwalla, Orbitz, Rambus, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems, Tesla 
Motors, Varian, VMware, Yahoo!, Zillow, and Instagram. Together they amount 
to hundreds of billions of dollars of market capitalization.

U.S. Military Funding Started a Chain Reaction
Most people believe the United States is leading the technology sector because 
of fiercely independent entrepreneurial minds. In reality, the government cre-
ated all these sectors with a heavy hand that had a  big influence on the des-
tiny of Silicon Valley. By transforming hundreds of acres of farmland into a hub 
of cutting-edge military technology, the U.S. Navy built Moffett Federal Airfield 
at the southern tip of San Francisco Bay in the 1930s. Large-scale subsidies 
from the military enabled the thriving electronics and semiconductor industry. 
The Internet emerged from a military research project. Heavy military funding 
started a chain reaction that led to the Silicon Valley we know today.
The electronics industry transformed the valley into a hotbed of innovation 
with Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Varian as its biggest success stories. They 
went public in 1956 and 1957 as the first Silicon Valley companies in history. 
Shockley Labs, set up in the heart of the valley, was the first company to 
work on silicon semiconductor devices and gave the region the nickname  
Silicon Valley. Its eight leading scientists later left Shockley together to create  
a joint venture with Fairchild Semiconductor, which revolutionized the 
chip-manufacturing industry. Many of the original founders of Fairchild 
Semiconductor set out to start their own companies in Silicon Valley: for 
example, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore started Intel, and Jerry Sanders 
and John Carey started Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). These new com-
panies had inclusive cultures with flat hierarchies and in many ways created 
a new generation of companies.
The Growth and Profitability of Venture Capital
Wealthy investors became interested in Silicon Valley after the first successful 
IPOs in the electronics and semiconductor industry. The passage of the Small 
Business Investment Act in 1958 enabled the large-scale financing of small 
entrepreneurial businesses in America. Another milestone was the establish-
ment of the limited partnership as a business structure in the 1970s. This pro-
vided an opportunity for general partners of venture capital funds to legally 
charge a 1–2.5% management fee of the investment capital raised. In addition, 
they charged a 20% fee on all profits of the fund. This is the venture capital 
model still in existence today.
It becomes apparent that the birth of Silicon Valley was not an overnight affair. 
In fact, it took more than 100 years to transform an area of farmland into the 
epicenter of innovation we know today. Not only were large-scale military 
funding and government protectionism a big part of it, but much luck and ser-
endipity played into this success story. When a government announces that it 
will build “the Silicon Valley of XYZ,” then we must assume they turn a blind

eye on history. Many puzzle pieces fell into place over decades to make it hap-
pen. None of them would have worked out of context in a different environ-
ment to quickly force the same ecosystem into existence.
If you have ever been in Mountain View, you notice that there is a certain 
energy in the air. A few millions, even billions, cannot buy this energy. It cannot 
be summoned by willpower. No government can legislate it into existence. 
And no university can just say it would like to have this energy and make it 
magically appear.
Forget about comparing universities or research parks with Silicon Valley. By 
aiming at the Sun, you may end up on the Moon, this is true. But there are 
other proven ways to make startup entrepreneurship work. Simple, practical 
steps have led to success in hundreds of startups, and some of them are out-
lined in this book. Begin applying them one by one, without trying to reinvent 
the wheel. Then your university and your startups will succeed.

Acknowledgments
I am grateful to all the entrepreneurs who have shaped and tested the ideas 
in this book. Their feedback and experiences with launching startups have 
helped challenge and improve the approaches and recommendations you are 
about to read. Thanks to all the people who believed in my own startups over 
the years, whether by co-founding them with me, investing in them, buying 
their products, or otherwise guiding them through their launch phases. 
I was fortunate to advise Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC) with my ideas, 
which Dr. Remo Burkhard made possible. I am grateful for his trust and 
his open-mindedness. Heartfelt thanks to his staff and the entire research 
and management team at SEC as well. I would also like to thank Dr. Ioannis 
Akkizidis for his outstanding remarks and guidance through the writing 
and editing process. Many thanks to Dr. Ting Dor Ngi from the National 
University of Singapore (NUS) for her excellent feedback and to Nati Sang 
for reviewing a very early draft of this book and improving it massively. 
At Apress, a brilliant team turned these ideas into the book you are reading. 
I would like to thank Robert Hutchinson for believing in this project early 
on and the entire editorial board for supporting it. Many thanks to James 
Markham, Rita Fernando, Tiffany Taylor, Anna Ishchenko, and everybody 
else at Apress who contributed their knowledge and energy to make this 
happen.

Preface
Eighteen Years as a Startup Entrepreneur
When I embarked on the path of entrepreneurship 18 years ago, little did 
I know exactly where it would lead me and what surprises were in store 
along the way. Some of my ideas and projects failed dismally, but luckily, 
others were far more successful than I ever dreamed. I learned many lessons 
and combined them with some thoughts about launching startups out of 
universities. This is what this book is about. 
My journey was far from elegant. Always thinking I would be a surgeon,  
I enrolled in medical school in my native Zurich/Switzerland. During the first 
year, it became clear that this was not for me, because my attention mostly 
focused on my private projects and experiments. After trying a few other 
fields, including psychology and sociology, I left university at age 21, slightly 
confused, with big plans about my own company and a bankroll in the high 
three digits. It was the dawn of the first Internet boom, and the winds were 
fortunate. Within a few short years, my little startup producing multimedia 
content for web pages had mushroomed into a respectable enterprise 
with several verticals and clients among the largest Swiss banks, insurance 
companies, airlines, hotels, automobile companies, and consumer brands. 
I profitably exited that business in 2001, six months before the NASDAQ 
crash had sunk in as a reality, and emigrated to Los Angeles, where the grass 
was greener (or so I thought). 
Replicating the business model that had worked back home was my first 
attempt at American business, which gave me much insight into how well-
protected and transparent the Swiss business environment had been. After 
producing a documentary film and founding several companies, a fun idea 
that had started as a side project eventually took flight and ended in a seven-
figure joint venture deal with a large Japanese media company. So I moved to 
Tokyo. Simultaneously, a software startup I had co-founded in San Francisco 
received seed funding from a venture capital firm. Life was good. A strong 
believer in life-long learning, I enrolled in the international program at the 
London School of Economics and studied for three post-grad finance and 
private equity designations, all at the same time. Then the software business 
missed its milestones for next-round funding in the financial crisis of 2007/8. 
In the following years, I started a consulting practice in finance and economics, 
into which I integrated my diverse entrepreneurial experience. 

Preface 
xiv
Is entrepreneurship always fun? Of course not. Nevertheless, startup war 
stories are fun to tell. There is often more learning in a failure than in a 
success, however painful it is. For example, I remember an epic computer 
crash that resulted in the total loss of all the data and backups of an expensive 
client project that was ready for delivery. It had taken 6 months to complete, 
and the deadline was 24 hours away. With much rhetoric, it was possible 
to push it forward 2 days. This left me with exactly 72 hours to produce 
everything again from scratch. Fixing the defective hardware. Flying in some 
of the experts who had been working on the project. Explaining the crisis, 
which made them laugh and me cringe inside. And on top of all that, keeping 
everybody on the project happy while pulling a three-nighter myself. Then 
the day came to deliver the project to the wary client. I needed all the 
goodwill I could possibly get. The principal decision-maker wanted to take a 
seat, but an employee accidentally pulled the chair out from underneath him 
and he landed hard on the concrete floor. And I had thought the situation 
could not get any worse.
In fact, many entrepreneurs doubt the path they have embarked on when they 
speak in private. Not when the million-dollar buyout has just completed, but 
when things are not going so well. Entrepreneurship seems in many respects 
to be the path of most resistance. It is impossible to know all the answers to 
why and how it works. It took me about a decade to wrap my head around 
certain successes and failures and to understand why they had happened 
and what I could have handled better. However, when the stars align and a 
project takes off like a rocket, that makes it all worthwhile. Over time, it 
becomes much easier to cope with the volatility of entrepreneurship. After 
all, high waves hardly scare those who have seen them before.
Currently I advise several startups on strategy, business development, and 
financial innovation, integrating the perspective of the serial entrepreneur, 
economist, investor, and venture capitalist. One consulting project includes 
a research university in Singapore. Launching startups out of academia holds 
much promise for the future and is dear to my heart, and so this book came 
about. 
For your journey to a successful startup, I wish you all the best. If I could do 
it, so can you. Just take that first step, and never look back.
