n a long and glorious history,
ancient Greece gave the world a
wonderful legacy of art and
literature.The invention of an
alphabet that allowed for the
development of sophisticated prose
and poetry led to the invention of
the theater and complex drama.
Western art reached its peak as
Greek sculptors created the first
truly lifelike statues and their
architects developed a style of
public building that has lasted until
today.The Greeks also invented
coinage as a means of payment, but
above all, they established a form of
government that today we call
“democracy.”Thanks to the Greeks
the voice and will of the people is
paramount in government.

M
ost land suited to agriculture is found
along the coastal plains and in a few
area of the Peloponnese.Within the sparsely
populated mountainous interior, many
communities were isolated from each other,
and even more so from the more inhabited
coastal regions.This isolation led to societies
that developed in very different ways.
Climate, too, played a role in increasing
social isolation. Mountain passes, blocked by
snow in the extremely harsh winters, cut off
communication even between neighboring
valleys for several months of the year.The
spring melt made the few tracks impassable
for a further period.
With pastoral land rare, the great plain of
Thessaly was the only place for raising
horses, which made Thessalians the strongest
in cavalry. For much of the rest, travel and
battling on foot was the norm.
The Spartan heartland in the Eurotas
valley of the Peloponnese was very fertile,
but it was a cradle surrounded by the crags
of Lakedaimon.As a result of their location
Spartans developed as a proud and fiercely
independent race, but also domineering and,
as their population expanded, territorially
aggressive toward other Greek nations.
Athens, on its protective gulf, surrounded
by sea, naturally developed as the dominant
seafaring nation.Athenian traders became
the logistics carriers for the region, although
many other seaside cities also used the sea as
a means of communication.
A look at the map of Greece shows the
many long fingers of land and islands, so it is
no wonder the Greeks became the most
adventurous of Mediterranean sailors after
the Phoenicians.The poor quality of their
land forced many Greeks to leave their
mainland homes and seek lands overseas to
settle—the Aegean islands, the coast of Asia
Minor (modern Turkey), Sicily, southern
Italy, and even as far off as southern France.
In Sicily, Greeks and Phoenicians would
battle for supremacy over many centuries.

INTRODUCTION
Landscape and Climate
Few civilizations in the ancient world were as much a product
of their geography as Greece. Three-quarters of Greece is
mountainous, and only one-fifth of the land can be cultivated.

W
hile the Stone Age tribes of mainland
Greece were beginning to establish
primitive urban settlements, on the island of
Crete a great Bronze Age civilization arose,
known as Minoan. Centered on the great
city-palace of Knossos, Minoan Crete
flourished between 2600 and 1250 BCE,
exporting its culture throughout the
southern Aegean.
The civilization began to decline after
1628 through a series of disasters. First the
volcanic island of Thera (modern Santorini)
exploded, sending a massive tidal wave to
crash into the northern shore of Crete.War
with the mainland Mycenaeans eroded
wealth and an invasion of the Sea People,
who later attacked Egypt, and then the
Dorians fatally weakened the Minoans.
Mycenaean heroes
The Mycenaeans (named after their most
important city of Mycenae) were Indo-
Europeans who migrated into Greece in
1900–1600 BCE.With a knowledge of horses
and bronze technology, the Mycenaeans soon
made the inhabitants of the scattered Greek
settlements their subjects.
Most cities of the time were derived from
Mycenae—Sparta,Thebes,Athens, and Pylos
being the most important. Mycenae was the
home of Agamemnon, the high king who
led the Greeks across the Aegean Sea to
make war on Troy.Along with them went
the legendary heroes of Homer’s Iliad, men
like Achilles,Ajax, and Odysseus.Troy was
destroyed in about 1200, when Mycenae was
at its peak. By this time, an early form of
Greek writing had been established.
The Sea Peoples who destroyed the
Minoans are also blamed for the collapse of
the Mycenaean age, but there was another
wave of invaders called Dorians, who may
have been a part of the Sea Peoples or
another Indo-European race altogether.
What is certain is that by 1100 BCE Greece
was plunged into a Dark Age.
The Dark Age lasted 300 years, during
which time Greece remained a mysterious
and barbaric land, a patchwork of small
settlements, each ruled by a “barbarian”
Dorian warlord.
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
A History of Greece, 2600–146 BCE
A patchwork of small, fiercely independent city-states,
constant inter-city warfare prevented national unity and
eventually weakened the Greeks, who fell to external threats.
Troy wins out
Romans claimed
descent from the
survivors of Troy,
who fled to Italy after
Greeks destroyed
their city. An irony,
then, that “Trojans”
came back 1100
years later as
Romans to steal
Greek freedom.

By 800 BCE, things had settled down, trade
returned, and small independent city-states
sprang up. New iron technology brought
improvements in farming tools and
weaponry.Agriculture improved dramatically,
paid for by the cities, which in turn jealously
protected the immediate countryside about
them.The time between 800 and 500 is
generally called the Archaic Period.
This was also a time when the great
migrations of colonists began to settle along
the coasts of the Black Sea, in Sicily and
southern Italy, and along the North African
coast. Colonies expanded trade, and the
accumulation of wealth promoted the birth
of the Classic Period of Greek history.
War and the development of politics
The ancient Greek word for “city” is polis.A
metropolis is a “mother city,” and politics is
the business of governing a city-state. Most
Greek cities were still ruled by warlords, but
Athenians experimented with other types of
government.“Oligarchy” was government by
a self-elected council of aristoi (aristocrats).
Sometimes the aristoi chose a single man to
rule, called a “tyrant.”
However, this concentration of power
irritated the growing mass of wealthy
citizens, who had no say in the government
but yet were expected to supply the men
and arms for the numerous petty wars with
other city-states.
Eventually, by 510 BCE internal strife and a
war with Sparta brought power to the demos
(people). Except for Sparta—which retained
its kings—the other Greek cities soon
adopted democracy, or “rule by the people”
(see pages 70–73).
War with Persia
In 490 BCE, the expanding Persian Empire
under Darius I invaded. Because of war with
Sparta,Athens stood alone to face the threat.
A band of 10,000 Athenians defeated twice
as many Persians at the battle of Marathon.
Darius died in 486, and his son Xerxes—
delayed by events in Egypt—attacked in 480
with a vast army.This time Sparta sent 300
soldiers, who held the Pass of Thermopylae
for days before they were cut down.Their
bravery bought time for Athens to ready its
fleet. In the great sea battle of Salamis,
Athens trounced the Persians and broke the
back of the invasion. Sensing victory, all the
Greek states joined in and decisively defeated
Xerxes at the Battle of Plataea in 479.
Athens and Greece fall
Athens now became the premier city of
Greece, using its wealth to erect some of the
finest temples and public buildings ever seen,
including the Parthenon. But austere Sparta
hated its rival and war broke out in 431.The
Peloponnesian War lasted until 404,
eventually dragging in most cities on one
side or the other. In the end, worn out,
Athens fell to Sparta’s military might.
The war had devastated Greece and paved
the way for the rise of Macedon. Under first
King Philip II and then his son Alexander,
Macedon conquered Greece.Alexander went
on to conquer the Persian Empire and found a
series of Hellenistic (Greek) dynasties that
fragmented after his death in 323. Further
power struggles continued to reduce Greece,
and even Macedon was unable to resist the new
power in the Mediterranean—the Romans.
Philip V supported the Carthaginian
general Hannibal against Rome, and in
return the Romans invaded in 171 BCE. By
146, all of Greece was under Roman
domination, and thereafter it would remain a
province of the Roman Empire.

the city of Mycenae at
its peak in the 13th
century BCE. The large
building in the center is
the megaron, or throne
room of the palace.
Mycenaean buildings
used massive stones in
their construction, a
style called “cyclopean”
by later Greeks. They
believed  that men
could never have raised
such heavy blocks and
instead these cities
were built by the giant
one-eyed cyclops.

B
efore the creation of the world, there
was only Chaos. From Chaos emerged
Gaia the mother—first of the Titans, gods
and giants who ruled the earth before their
overthrow by Zeus.Without mating, Gaia
produced a son called Uranus, who
represented the heavens. Gaia then mated
with Uranus and they had many Titan
children.These included Rhea and Cronus
(Father Time), who came to rule after
defeating Uranus.
Cronus and Rhea had many children, but
fearing for his own position, he ate them all
as they were born, until Rhea tricked him
into eating a rock instead of the newborn
Zeus. Later, Zeus rebelled against Cronus
and made him disgorge all his siblings.Then
he banished Cronus and the other Titans to
the Underworld.
Other important Titans
Meanwhile, Oceanus (oceans) and his sister
Tethys produced the rivers and 3000 water
nymphs, while Hyperion married his sister
Theia, who gave birth to Helios (the sun),
Selene (moon goddess), and Eos (the dawn).
Iapetos married a nymph and fathered
Prometheus (god of forethought and
wisdom), Epimetheus (god of afterthought
and stupidity), and Atlas. Unlike his brothers,
Atlas supported Cronus against Zeus, and
when Zeus won he punished muscular Atlas
by making him support the world on his
back. Zeus then ordered Prometheus and
Epimetheus to create humankind.
The sky gods
These are the Greek myths of the creation.
But myths always represent some sort of
reality.The overthrow of the Titans (the
earth gods) by Zeus and the Olympians (the
sky gods) represents a major change in
14
CHAPTER 1
From the Beginning of Time
In a time before real Greek history came to be written down,
there was a golden age, when gods and heroes walked the
earth alongside ordinary mortals.
Land of Gods and Heroes
After the titanic
struggles, Zeus
emerges as the ruler of
all the gods. From the
cloud-capped summit of
Mount Olympus, he is
assisted by an extended
family, an inner circle of
11 other Olympians
(shown here in the
family tree, with their
roles listed overleaf).

prehistoric Greek society.The original
natives of Greece worshipped the female-
ruled earth gods, but the Indo-European
Dorians—who invaded from the north in
about 1100 BCE—worshipped the male-
dominated sky gods called Olympians.
Later Greek writers explained this change
by reorganizing the way the pantheon
(collection of gods) worked.They say that
Zeus drew lots with his brothers, Hades and
Poseidon, to become supreme ruler. Zeus
won, and became ruler of the sky, Poseidon
received the seas, and Hades ended up in the
Underworld, to rule over the dead.
From this time onward the Olympians were
the brothers and sisters of Zeus, as well as his
children born of many goddesses and
nymphs, including his sister and jealous
wife Hera.
Jealous and bad-tempered gods
The Greeks believe the sky gods dwell on
top of sacred Mount Olympus, from which
they get their collective name. But the family
is riven with jealousy. In the myths, the
Olympians are always arguing and use
mortals to help them get their way.
This interference in human affairs brings
benefits but also great dangers to the favored
person, who is almost certain to earn the
enmity of another god or goddess as a result.
During the Trojan War, Zeus took the
Greeks’ side, while Apollo favored the
people of Troy, and almost all the gods
interfered in the adventures of Odysseus.
So, the Greek gods are not necessarily
benign, and accounts of their plotting and
treachery make it clear that they suffer from
all the common sins of humanity—only on a
grand scale. Given the gods’ erratic and often
bad-tempered natures, Greeks spend more
time in their temples trying to keep them
happy than they do hoping to follow their
divine example.

LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Roles of the Olympian Gods
The number of Greek divinities is staggering—someone to
look after every aspect of life, occasion, and event. Here are
the primary roles of the Olympians; lesser gods appear
throughout this book, accompanied by a brief description.
Hera: marriage, birth
The wife of Zeus is always jealous
of his many love affairs. She
punishes her rivals and their children
with terrible fury. Zeus—who rarely
stands up to her—resorts to trickery,
by hiding his children or changing
them into animals to disguise them.
Poseidon: sea, earthquakes
As god of the sea, sailors pray to
him for a safe voyage—but he is
not always reliable. In a bad mood,
Poseidon strikes the ground with
his trident and causes earthquakes
and storms, shipwrecks and
drownings.Among his numerous
children are the half-human and
half-fish Triton, the flying horse
Pegasus, and (according to some)
Theseus, a king of Athens.
Athena: war, wisdom, arts, justice
It is said that Zeus feared that his first wife
Metis, goddess of wisdom, might bear a son
mightier than himself, so he ate her. Inside,
she began making a cloak and a helmet for
her daughter.The hammering caused Zeus
great pain and made him cry out.At that
Hephaestus split his father’s skull open and
from it emerged Athena, fully grown and
wearing Metis’s robe and helmet.
Athena contested her uncle Poseidon for 
a certain city they both wanted. He made a
well spring up, but the salty water did not
please the people.Athena’s gift was an olive
tree, which gave the citizens oil, wood, and
food. So they acclaimed her the winner and
named the city after her—Athens.
Apollo: music, prophecy,
medicine, poetry
Apollo is identified with Helios
the sun god. He is also the god
of plague—according to
Homer’s Iliad,Apollo shot
plague-infected arrows into the
Greek camp in the Trojan
War. His most important
cult center is at Delphi,
which he occupied after
slaying a dragon called the
Python. He then
dedicated the sanctuary
and gave oracular powers
to a priestess—the
Pythia—to whom
people go to seek
answers to the future.
One of his sons is
Asclepius, the god of
healing (see page 86).
Artemis: hunting, wild
animals, fertility
Her main role is to hunt lions
and wild game in the forests,
attended by her nymphs, and
armed with a bow and arrows
made by Hephaestus.Artemis is
quick to punish any man who
insults her.When a young hunter
accidentally saw Artemis and her
nymphs bathing in a pool, she
turned him into a stag.Then she
set his own dogs on him and,
thinking he was just another stag,
they chased and killed their master.

Hades: ruler of the dead and
the Underworld
Hades has a helmet which makes him
invisible. He rules the dead, helped by his
assistants, the ferryman Charon and the
three-headed hound Cerberus. Because
everyone’s wealth finally comes to Hades, he
is referred to as “the Rich One.” Of all the
gods, Hades is the one who is liked the least,
even by the gods. He abducted Persephone
from the upperworld to be his wife.
17
CHAPTER 1: LAND OF GODS AND HEROES
Hermes: messenger and herald of the gods
Hermes is also patron of literature, weights
and measures, merchants, shepherds, athletes,
thieves, and travelers. In this last guise he
looks after roads and boundaries, which is
why the marker stones at intersections
and frontiers are called “herms.”
Athenians place herms outside
their houses to fend off evil.
As a herald, it is also his
duty to guide dead
souls to the
Underworld; and
while they sleep he
brings dreams to
mortals.
Hephaestus: fire, metalworkers
Hephaestus is the patron of all
craftsmen, especially those
working with metal. He is also
the god of volcanoes. He is
known as the lame god,
because he was born weak
and disabled. Hephaestus
makes weapons and armor
for the other gods and
heroes, as well as the
thunderbolts Zeus throws.
He also made the sun
chariot in which Helios
rides every day across the sky.
Ares: war and destruction
Where his ugly brother
Hephaestus is kind, handsome
Ares is vain and cruel. He
enjoys bloody battles, with
little care for which side
wins—the other gods
dislike Ares almost as
much as they do Hades.
Aphrodite: love, desire, beauty
She was so beautiful that Zeus
married her to Hephaestus, the
steadiest of the gods, to keep her
in check. But Aphrodite, who
enjoys laughter and glamor, is
not pleased at being the wife of
hard-working Hephaestus. She
is loved by many gods and
mortals. Her festival is the
Aphrodisiac, celebrated in many
centers.Aphrodite is associated
with the Mesopotamian Ishtar.
Hestia: the hearth fire, domestic life
Hestia swore to remain a virgin.
She has no throne, but tends the
sacred fire in the hall on
Olympus and every hearth
on Earth is her altar. She
is the gentlest of all the
Olympians.The
Romans call her
Vesta.

T
he origins of the hero cult lie in the
10th century BCE, and are associated
with the development of a particular part of
Greece, such as Heraeus, founder of the city
of Heraea (from which the word “hero” is
derived).
Greek mythology contains many accounts
of the actions of gods, goddesses, nymphs,
and satyrs, but the central characters are
usually heroes. Many of them are the
children of the gods, or at least of royal
parents particularly blessed by the gods.
Although they are raised above common
mortals, they share their human lifespan.
Heroes in the Trojan War
Through the writings of Homer (in his Iliad
and Odyssey), most of these heroes are
associated with the Mycenaean era (ended
by about 1100 BCE).This is the period of the
Trojan War, when King Agamemnon of
Mycenae led a fleet and army to besiege the
city of Troy (Ilium to the Greeks), on the far
side of the Aegean Sea.
Agamemnon’s companions are the
ultimate Greek heroes—warriors such as
Achilles,Ajax, Menelaus, Nestor, Diomedes,
Philoctetes, and Odysseus.They are matched
by the heroism of their Trojan rivals—Priam,
Hector, and Paris.
As an infant,Achilles had been dipped in
a sacred pool whose waters made him
invincible, save for the heel by which his
mother held him. Helen, Spartan wife of
Menelaus, was reputedly a child of Zeus, as
was her brother Pollux.The goddess Athena
protected Odysseus on his post-war travels.
Tales of fate and irony
The Greeks believe in this blend of heroism
and divinity because the characters are
historic to them.They had lived only a few
centuries earlier, and in the same part of the
world.The place names mentioned by
Homer are real and can be visited by any
Greek traveler.
The common theme in these tales is fate.
On returning from the Trojan War as heroes,
they are still unable to escape their mortal
fate.Agamemnon is murdered by his wife in
a palace coup when he returns to his capital.
Odysseus spends ten years wandering the
seas trying to get back home, only to have to
kill his wife’s new suitors, after she had given
him up for dead.
This notion of irony and fate is a
continual theme, from the tale of King
Oedipus of Thebes (who, through a
confusion of events, unknowingly kills his
father and marries his mother), or Icarus, the
son of Daedalus, to Theseus, who slays the
Minotaur.The blend of moral statement,
heroic deed, and revenge over enemies and
unfaithful partners binds the Greeks to their
heroes—superhuman, and yet mortal.
18
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Greek Heroes
The heroes of Greek mythology stand between the gods and mortals. These cult
figures include real warriors as well as those of legend. In a world where the deities’
example is not necessarily one to follow, they are an inspiration to ordinary people.
The fate of Icarus
The inventor Daedalus built the labyrinth that
housed the monstrous Minotaur of King
Minos of Crete. But when he helped the hero
Theseus of Athens to kill the Minotaur and
escape the maze, Minos imprisoned Daedalus
and his son Icarus. Unable to escape the island
by sea, Daedalus used his skills to build
wings for himself and Icarus. Daedalus
warned Icarus to fly at moderate
altitude.Too high and the sun
might melt the wax fastening
the feathers to the wings—
too low and the sea
might dampen the
feathers.
Alas, young Icarus,
excited by the flight,
ignored his father’s
warning and flew
ever higher and
higher.The sun
melted the wax
and the boy fell
into the water
and drowned.
The myth explores a favorite theme of a
man attempting to equal the gods and
suffering retribution for his presumption
and arrogance. It also points out that the
young often suffer for ignoring their 
parents’ wisdom and experience.

Jason and the Argonauts
19
CHAPTER 1: LAND OF GODS AND HEROES
King Pelias of Iolcos,
fearing Prince Jason’s
ambition, sent him
on an impossible
mission to bring
back the fabled
Golden Fleece from
distant Colchis. Jason
and his crew—the
Argonauts—sailed
off in their ship, the
Argo. On the voyage,
they became the first
humans to pass
through the
Clashing Rocks.
In order to
receive the fleece,
the king of Colchis
demanded that Jason
plow a field using
fire-breathing oxen
and sow it with the
teeth of a dragon.
Then he must defeat
the warriors who
spring from these
“seeds.” Finally, Jason
had to overcome the
sleepless dragon who
guards the fleece.
He was helped in
these deeds by
Medea, the king’s
daughter.After
obtaining the
Golden Fleece, the
two fled back to
Iolcos, where
Medea murdered
King Pelias. Later,
Jason deserted her
for another woman.
Medea took her
revenge by
murdering the bride
and her children.
Jason was killed
years later when
a piece of
timber from
the Argo
struck him
on the head.
This myth describes the
probably real coup that
took place at Iolcos
when the half-
legendary King Jason
came to power there.
But it mingles with the
earliest accounts of
Achilles’ heel
Achilles, son of the mortal Peleus and the nymph Thetis, was the
mightiest of the Greek heroes in the Trojan War.Thetis made her
baby immortal by dipping him in the River Styx, whose sacred
waters make everything it touches become invulnerable.
But she held him by one heel, which remained dry
and unprotected.Years later, in the war,Achilles
distinguished himself by many deeds and was
recognized on both sides as an undefeatable
warrior. However, when Paris, son of the Trojan
King Priam, shot Achilles in the
unprotected heel with an arrow,
Achilles died of the wound.
Greek traders who
ventured through the
Hellespont strait (the
Clashing Rocks, known
today as the
Dardanelles) into the
Black Sea, where
Colchis was supposedly
situated. The irony of
Jason’s fate is that his
famous ship kills him.
Fate, it seems, is
inescapable, even for
the greatest of heroes.

I
n a civilization with so many gods to
please, festivals are common. Religious
observation in Greece is virtually a constant
activity, since to omit the worship of a god is
to invite divine retribution—and no one
wants that.
To an outsider, many of these festivals
might appear far from religious.They include
events such as panhellenic (all-Greek)
athletic games (see pages 74–77), theatrical
dramas (see pages 90–93), and civic
processions designed to please those taking
part and those watching. But every one is
dedicated to the gods and held in locations
that have a religious significance for the
Greeks. Many of these have been dedicated
to one or more of the Olympian deities.
And all festivals are linked to a certain
mystery cult, or the worship of a particular
god or goddess.
The big festivals
Most religious festivals begin with a
procession, where the god’s cult followers
honor their deity, while other citizens with
their wives and children—gather on the sides
to offer observance.Those in the procession
carry food offerings for the god, such as
honey, bread, and cake. Sometimes livestock
is slaughtered in a sacrificial ritual. Dancing
and singing often feature in these events,
which can last for several days.
Large cites like Athens,Thebes, and
Corinth hold several festivals every year, and
even larger events every two, three, or four
years.The most famous of these is the
Athenian Great Panathenaic procession, a
week-long festival held every four years in
honor of the goddess Athena.
A United Nations of Greece
Most cults are local affairs, but several festivals
unite all of Greece.These “panhellenic”
festivals are often held in locations of
particular religious importance, such as at
Delphi (dedicated to the god Apollo) or
Eleusis (cult center for Demeter).These sites
are lavishly provided with festival buildings,
temples, and sports stadiums.
Here, especially during festivals, the sacred
ground is neutral, so even warring city-states
may meet each other in safety.Their
delegates can even discuss peace or trade
treaties.Almost every city-state of Greece has
its treasury on the grounds of Delphi
because the gods’ scrutiny provides security.
Demeter and Eleusis
One of the oldest cults is that of Demeter, the
goddess responsible for the earth’s fertility,
particularly the growth of cereal crops. She
ended mankind’s nomadic existence by
teaching the skills of plowing and sowing.
Her cult center is at Eleusis, a complex some
14 miles northwest of Athens with the great
temple of Telesterion at its heart. It has grown
over centuries, as the plan opposite shows.
20
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Oracles and Mystery Cults
Religious festivals are often the only break from daily routine that most citizens
enjoy, so they are widely popular. They allow the free population of a city to join
together for religious devotion and civic entertainment.
One of the most
mysterious of cults is
that of the Pythian
oracle of Apollo at
Delphi. This red-figure
painting on a plate
shows a king consulting
the priestess Pythia 
at Delphi, seated on her
three-legged “tripod”
stool.

Wisdom of the oracle
The most famous oracle in Greece is that of
Apollo at Delphi (see also pages 22–23). It
was discovered long ago that a cleft in the
side of Mount Parnassus emitted a gas that
caused seizures among the goats that grazed
nearby.When a goatherd was also affected,
the locals interpreted his convulsions and
ravings as divine inspiration.
This became the place decreed by Apollo
to be the omphalus (navel) of the world.
Delegations now travel from all over Greece
to seek advice, the words of Apollo
interpreted through the medium of the
Pythia, high priestess of Delphi.
The Pythia is crowned in laurel and seated
on a tripod perched over the vaporous cleft.
Any man (women are not allowed in the
sanctuary) wishing to ask a question about
the future must first be ritually purified by
washing in the Castalian Spring, which is
where Apollo killed the Python dragon.
The request is written down and given to
the Pythia by a priest. Her utterances are
usually so disjointed that her servant-priests
are needed to interpret the answer—even
then, they often get it wrong, to the
questioner’s usually dreadful misfortune.
Worship and fun
Since most cults are limited to men, the
festivals of Dionysus (god of wine) are
popular, since women may also take part.
The festivals involve drinking a great deal of
wine, mass chanting, and frenzied dancing
(see also page 41).
The antics of the Dionysian cult may not
look like worship, but celebrating their gods
through festivals is an important part of
Greek religious belief.And while they
celebrate, they are also free from the
constraints of normal daily life, which makes
Greek festivals a unique combination of
devotion, entertainment,
and spectacle.

the Athenians.This stoa (a covered walkway)
is built in the Ionic order, and has seven
fluted, or grooved columns, each made from
a single stone.According to the inscription, it
was erected by the Athenians after 478 BCE
to house the trophies taken in their naval
victories over the Persians.
The Sacred Way now bends around to
take the last, steep rise up to the great Doric
temple dedicated to Apollo. Inside is the

Facing the steps to the temple’s entrance

the 5th century BCE.The monument is made
of black marble, except for the base and

LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
A Day Out at Delphi
Delphi is located on the southern slopes of sacred Mount Parnassus, about 12
miles from the Gulf of Corinth. While some come here to question the oracle, most
attend the site to celebrate a festival of Apollo or Dionysus.

Drama and recreation
In addition to the many altars, Delphi has
a large theater with 35 rows of stone
benches, where dramatic
performances associated with the
cult of Dionysus are given. Beyond
it, just outside the wall, is the large
stadium where the panhellenic
Pythian Games take place.
Outside the southwestern wall
stands the gymnasium.This complex
of buildings is used by the youths of
Delphi for their education and
athletic practice. It is constructed on
two levels, with a free open space used
for running practice on the upper, and
on the lower a palaestra (exercise yard),
the pool, and the thermae (baths).
All these many and varied activities
form a part of the experience of
visiting Delphi.
gymnasium of two stories
The theater is an
important part of the
religious activities.

I
n Greek worship, the main focus for the
celebrants is the altar. In its earliest form,
the altar was little more than a simple block
of stone standing in the open air.This
explains why, even at great religious centers
like Delphi, there are so many altars—small
and large—standing within the sanctuary
without the protection of a building. Even
when a temple is erected, its associated altar
is placed outside to the east of it and not
inside the building (see the plan on the previous
page, altar of the Chians).
The temple itself is designed to be an
oikos (house) for the god’s cult statue.The
basic plan of the earliest Greek temple was
based on the ground plan of a house, and
grander temples based on a Mycenaean
palace megaron (throne hall). Like a simple
house, these temples consisted of a cella, or
single room, with porches at the front
supported by columns.To distinguish the
divine house from a mortal one, the temple
was made longer, with the cult statue placed
at the back of the cella.
Temples become more elaborate
Later temples have a peristyle, an outer series
of posts supporting extended roof eaves.This
colonnade provides a covered ambulatory
(roofed walkway) and distinguishes the
building from purely civic architecture.
All these early temples were constructed of
wood, or from mud brick, with timbering
and a thatched or clay tile roof.
After about 650 BCE, the Greeks began 
to visit Egypt regularly and saw the
monumental stone buildings there.This
inspired Greek architects, and they began to
replace their simple wooden pillars with
stone columns, architraves, and cornices.
However, they retained much of the original
wooden structure in the new stone forms—
so the triglyphs represent the ends of wooden
beams (see Parthenon diagram, right).
In time, three distinctive styles of columns,
and the capitals that topped them and
supported the roof, evolved.The three types
of arrangement are called “orders” and
known as Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian.The
earliest, Doric, is simple and severe in
appearance, while the latest, Corinthian is
very elaborate in its decoration.
Doric style
The Doric order arrived in the later seventh
century BCE. Its parts—simple, baseless
columns (fluted or plain), spreading capitals,
and the triglyph-metope frieze (alternating
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
The Greek Temple
The temple is the greatest expression of civic Greek pride. 
A temple is the house of a god, so much attention is given 
to building and decorating it.

orders of architecture.

columns—are an aesthetic development in
stone of the structures used functionally in
earlier wood and brick construction. Doric
has long remained the favorite order of the
Greek mainland and western colonies, and
has hardly changed throughout its history.
Ionic order
The Ionic order evolved later in about 600
BCE, in eastern Greece.While the basic
proportions and construction style of Doric
is retained, columns with capitals elaborately
carved in floral hoops, known as “volutes”
distinguish the Ionic style—borrowed from
oriental models.
Corinthian order
The most slender and ornate of the three
Greek orders, Corinthian is characterized by
a bell-shaped capital with its double row of
carved acanthus leaves, and an elaborate
cornice.The earliest example dates from
about 420 BCE, but the Greeks themselves
make little use of the Corinthian style—
although the Romans love it.
The Acropolis of Athens
The most impressive examples of Greek
architecture of the high Classical Period
were built on the Athenian Acropolis for
Pericles.The Acropolis architecture—while it
is a clear display of civic pride—shows
subtlety of design in the use of the Doric
and Ionic orders.The Athena Parthenos, or
Parthenon—designed in the Doric style by
the sculptor Phidias and architects Ictinus
and Callicrates—contrasts with the
Erechtheum.This temple, which houses
several cults, provides a decorative Ionic
counterpart to the severe Parthenon.
The Parthenon is the cult house for a
great statue of Athena by Phidias, a statue
that honors the city goddess; the oldest cult
of Athena is housed in the Erechtheum.

the columns, the architects use tricks to avoid the illusion that
long, straight platforms appear to sink in the middle, so each
curves upward as it nears its center. The long sides are 4.3 inches
higher and the east and west ends 2.3 inches higher.
This west end of the temple is not the main entrance—that is at
the east end, with the altar beyond it. The room behind the doors

Columns are never straight. To avoid the “slimming”
illusion that tall, straight sides give, they bulge
outward by about an inch one-third of the way up,
and are narrower at the top than at the base (the
effect is exaggerated in this illustration).

LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
T
he “all-Athenian festival” is one of the
occasions when women can get out of
the house and take an active role in a public
function. Even Metics (foreign residents) and
freed slaves may participate in some of the
festival’s events.The holiday starts on the last
day of the first month of the Athenian year,
which is Athena’s birthday. It lasts for a
whole week, and brings great joy through
the ahtletic and musical contests, sacrifices,
feasting, and the great procession.
Proof of fitness and skill
The contests include athletics, music, singing,
equestrian events, torch relay races, and boat
races.The last are not a usual part of Greek
festivals, but the citizens honor Athena’s
association with boat-building (she helped
construct Jason’s ship Argo).The various
types of athletic competition are covered in
the section on the Olympics (pages 74–75).
All these events, except for the torch and
boat races, are open to boys (aged 12–16),
ageneios, or youths (16–20), and men.The
first- and second-place winners receive jars
filled with olive oil as prizes.The olive tree
and its fruit are sacred to Athena (see page 16)
and the oil is a valuable commodity almost
anywhere in the world. Prize-winners
usually sell their oil for cash.
In three cultural competitions, contestants
show their musical ability in singing while
playing on the stringed kithara or the aulos
(a reed woodwind instrument), while aulos
players perform without singing.Winners 
of these contests are also well rewarded.The
rhapsodes (“stitchers of song”) are also highly
prized.These are not singers, but reciters of
epic poetry, particularly Homeric poems.
The Panathenaic procession
This is the festival’s highlight. Starting before
dawn, the procession proceeds along the
Panathenaic Way through the agora (see page
64) toward the Acropolis, stopping only for
sacrifices offered on the Areopagus hill.
The Great Panathenaic Festival
This festival takes place every four years in Athens. It is the
grandest in all of Greece, matched in importance only by the
Olympic Games.

LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Death and the Underworld
Unlike the Egyptians, who believe in reanimation of the deceased, the Greeks see
death as one of the harsher lots of mankind, and the Underworld a shadowy place
populated by disembodied souls.
Preparing for the funeral
As soon as the physician has declared a man
dead, the women of his family take charge of
the body. It is important to place a coin in
the deceased’s mouth to pay Charon the
ferryman, who will take the soul across the
River Styx to enter the realm of Hades.Those
who do not pay are stranded on the shores
of the Styx and may come back to haunt
their families—not an appealing prospect.
The body is washed in perfumed water,
clothed in festal white, and the head crowned
with vine leaves. Now, properly dressed for
the funeral, the body is laid out on a couch
in the front doorway of the house, with the
face turned toward the street to greet anyone
who comes to pay their last respects.
W
hen a person dies, their shade (spirit)
leaves the body to enter the kingdom
of Hades, god of the dead.What is left
behind is just a phantom image, which must
either be buried or cremated—wealth
generally decides the choice. Slaves are
simply buried in small pots, and few poor
people can afford a cremation.
Since women usually own little in the way
of property, their funerals are simple affairs,
but a man must prepare carefully for his

Dead souls pay Charon the Ferryman to row them

as the Underworld. The three-headed dog Cerberus

death. As soon as a man senses his end is
near, he makes out his will. Failure to do so
may result in acrimonious lawsuits among his
family. Because widows rarely inherit, the will
details who will look after his wife and
daughters. It says how his wealth is to be
shared among the male family members and
may mention certain favorite slaves to receive
freedom. It gives directions as to the style of
his tomb and finally names those he wants to
execute (carry out) the will’s instructions.

A noisy lamentation
A wealthy Greek man expects to receive
elaborate funeral rites, and in some cities it
has become necessary to limit the amount
spent, otherwise great sums may literally 
“go up in smoke” on the funeral pyres.
The mourning is loud and protracted.
The widow beats her breast, tearing her hair
(unless she has already shaved it off), while
the other women sprinkle ashes on their
heads. By contrast, when a man buries his
wife, the behavior is more restrained.
In the background, the slave women keep
up a loud moaning and even the visiting
men shed tears and utter loud lamentations.
Outside, the hired dirge singers maintain a
melancholy chant, beat their breasts, and
almost convince passersby that they are
frantic with grief.
The funeral procession
Because a person’s shade cannot enter the
Underworld until all the funeral rites have
been completed, it is essential to proceed
with the funeral by the second day after
death.This is held as early as possible in the
morning, before sunrise.
Male relatives carry the funerary bier,
following behind the hired dirge singers.The
corpse has a honey cake put in his hands and
a flask of oil placed under their head.The
grieving widow, chief heir, and other male
relatives follow the bier.Women under the
age of 60 are not allowed to join a funeral
procession unless they are first cousins or
closer kin of the deceased.
The procession takes a long time, not only
because it proceeds at a slow pace, but
because the cemetery is placed along a main
road beyond the city walls.
The burial
At the appointed place, a funeral pyre is
already prepared.There are no priests
present, no prayers are said or hymns sung.
The ashes are placed in a small urn and
buried. Later, a simple stone monument may
be erected above the urn or coffin, and on
the third, ninth, and 30th days after the
funeral there are simple religious ceremonies
with offerings of garlands, fruits, and
offerings of wine at the new tomb.

to house the body of the
tyrant Mausollus of
Caria and completed in

are filled with statues.
The burial chamber sits
on a pillared podium,
topped by a pyramid-
shaped roof. On its

T
hree-quarters of Greece is mountainous,
rocky and barren, and only one fifth of
the land can be cultivated, as the map below
shows. Despite this drawback, most people in
Greece make their living from farming. Even
the citizens of towns often have a farm in
the country to provide their main income.
The best farming land is found around the
coastal plains, parts of Attica, and in Thessaly.
However, with hot and very dry summers,
the main crops are called “Mediterranean”—
ones that thrive on winter rainfall and need
no rain in the summer.These crops include
wheat, barley, grapes, pomegranates, figs, and
olives.
Rural areas are often very isolated, with
communities separated from their neighbors
by steep ridges and mountains. Here, life can
be poor, with farmers producing only
enough food for their own needs. Nearer to
the sea, the better quality land provides a
wider variety of foods, as well as a plentiful
sea catch and products imported from
elsewhere, especially cereals from Egypt.
30
CHAPTER 2
Ownership of the Land
Greece is divided into numerous small city-states that claim
ownership of the surrounding countryside. Within each state,
most citizens are farmers, but what they own is dictated by
their wealth—or lack of it.

A farmer’s hard lot
Only citizens of a polis (city-state, or citizen-
state) may own land, but being a citizen and
land-owner does not necessarily make a
person rich. Greece is full of smallholders,
who can barely make a living from their
land. In the countryside of Attica most of the
poorer farmers produce wheat and barley,
while the wealthy and nobility own estates
that produce wine and olive oil.
Although wheat is important, wheat-
farming is not well managed.The farmers do
not have enough land to practice crop
rotation (moving crops between fields each
season), so the soil’s fertility gradually reduces.
If crop production falls, it is the poor farmer
who suffers because the wealthy Greeks can
simply import what they need.This also
pushes down the price the local farmer can
get for his produce, and so he has to borrow
money and get into debt—usually to a richer
person, who then takes land as payment.
Sometimes, in order to pay off debts, the
average farmer is forced to sell his
children, wife, and even himself into a
limited form of slavery. Situations like this
explain why, from time to time, the rural
people explode into rebellion against the city-
dwellers who have claimed all the wealth.
Important farm animals
Wealthier farmers—especially the nobility
who live in the big cities—employ poor
citizens as managers and use slaves to farm
their land.The young are often employed as
herders to look after the goats and sheep that
graze on the upper pastureland.
Given the rocky nature of the land, goats
are the most important animals, since they
can cope easily on the almost barren hilltops.
The lack of suitable grazing means that cows
are rare, and horses even more so, affordable
only by the rich.

The grain harvest
Grain sown in October grows during the
wettest months of the year. Oxen pull the
plow, steered by one man, while another
follows, scattering the seed by hand (1).
Depending on the amount of winter rainfall,
grain is harvested between May and July
using sickles (2).
It is then threshed from the stalks in a
manner similar to that employed by
Egyptians, by driving mules over it on a
circular stone threshing floor (3). Many of
the early religious sanctuaries grew up
around a threshing floor (see map of Delphi,
page 23, and also pages 90–93).
The threshing process also removes the
chaff, or outer husk of the grain kernels, and
so threshing floors are often positioned in a
place where the wind helps to blow the
lighter chaff away. Otherwise, the young boys
of the family winnow it by throwing the
grain into the air on sieves (4).
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
The Farming Year
Greece is a land of farmers, and for those with a surplus of
produce to sell the agora, or marketplace, is the center of
their world.
T
he agora is the heart of every Greek city
or town of reasonable size (see page 64).
Early morning is a time of frantic bustle, as
the farmers set up stalls of olive oil, pork,
cheese, grain, fruit, eggs, and animal hides.
Once they have sold their produce, the
country people return to their farms,
smallholders on foot, the better off riding the
empty cart pulled by one of their oxen.
Selling is only a tiny part of the farmer’s
life—growing crops in poor soil is the more
difficult part.The Greeks do not practice
crop rotation.They sow crops one year and
leave the field to lie fallow for the next to
give the soil time to recover.This puts even
more pressure on the scarce cultivable land.

Livestock
While horses are rare—except in Thessaly,
where there is lots of pasture—most farmers
keep oxen, donkeys, and mules as draft
animals. Sheep and goats provide wool, hides,
meat, and milk, which is also used to make
cheese. Pigs are kept close to the farmhouse,
where they can be watched to prevent them
from scavenging in the vegetable patch, and
in winter they provide extra heat once
penned inside the house. Poultry is also
valuable for both meat and eggs, but ducks
and chickens have to be closely guarded from
foxes, which are everywhere.
Farming wealth—vines and olives
Hill farmers keep bees and produce the
honey that is the Greeks’ main sweetener.
Peas, lentils, beans, garlic, onions, and cabbage
are plentiful, but the major source of
agricultural wealth comes from cultivating
olive trees and vines.
The vineyard owner needs the
money he makes, because it takes a
lot of workers to cultivate and
harvest the vines—and slaves are not
so numerous in rural Greece as in
other countries (except around
Athens, where they outnumber the
citizen population).The vines are
grown on terraced hillsides to get the
best of the sun. Once ripened, the grapes are
picked in September.They are then trodden
underfoot in large vats made of wood or
mortar, which slope down to an outlet.
The juice is collected in clay jars and left to
ferment for about six months in a cool cellar.
When the fermentation process has stopped,
the wine is poured into large clay vessels
called amphorae for ease of transport (see
page 68).
Olive trees take about 16 years
before they begin to yield usable fruit.
Once again, only a wealthy farmer
can afford this kind of investment, but
the returns are huge. Olives are
gathered by shaking the branches and
collecting the fallen fruit in baskets.The
fruit is pulped in a hand mill before the
oil is extracted in a stone press.
Olive oil is used for cooking, lighting,
washing, and in many beauty products;
athletes rub themselves down with it. Greek
oil is prized all around the Mediterranean.

n theory, a Greek colony is the property of
its mother city, or metropolis. But in most
cases the colonies are allowed to act
independently.The creation of a new colony
is a highly organized process.The settlement is
set up as a mirror image of its metropolis, with
the same political structure, laws, and even
religious temples or cults as the parent city.
Colonies are almost always established on
a coast for ease of communication by sea
with the metropolis, and in areas where
trading links have already been established.
Greek colonies now exist all over the Aegean
and Mediterranean Seas and on the shores of
the Black Sea.The principal areas of
settlement beyond the Aegean are in Libya,
southern Italy, Sicily, and even the coast of
southern France.
All these regions produce goods that can
be exported to Greece: wool from North
Africa, Italy, and Asia Minor; grain from the
Black Sea coast and the Crimea; grain, dye,
and hides from Sicily; and cereals and
papyrus from Egypt.

The Colonies—in Search of Farming Land

many Greeks overseas to establish colonies. Before long, many of these emigrant
farmer-communities have grown into major city-states in their own right.

So dense is the level of colonization in
southern Italy and Greece, that the region
has become known to the Romans as Magna
Graecia (Greater Greece).Astonishing as it
may seem, a handful of Greek cities has
spawned hundreds of colonies clustered
around the Mediterranean—as Socrates puts
it,“like frogs around a pond.”
35
CHAPTER 2: LIVING OFF LAND AND SEA
The first colonies were
set up in the 8th
century in southern Italy
and Sicily. The city-
states of Athens and
Sparta were most busy
in developing colonies
here, but the Corinthian
colony of Syracuse is
the most prosperous
Sicilian settlement,
closely followed by
Acragas. In the early
7th century, colonies
were founded around
the Black Sea and the
Hellespont strait
(Dardanelles), most
established by the
island city-state of
Miletos. The Libyan
colony of Cyrene
spawned further
colonies of its own on
the North African coast.
The Ionian Greek
settlement established
at Massilia (Marseilles)
in about 600 BCE has
expanded into a thriving
port that dominates
trade between Greece
and the French
countryside.
The Greek colonies
have produced some of
the finest minds of the
time; a handful of the
most famous are shown
on these pages.

CHAPTER 2: LIVING OFF LAND AND SEA
T
he ringing of the “fish bell” to
announce the arrival of a fresh catch is
the signal for a rush of householders to the
agora. Such is the eagerness for fish that a tale
is told about a recital by a lyre player whose
entire audience dashed off when they heard
the fish bell ring, with the exception of one
deaf man.When the musician thanked him
for staying to listen to the end of his playing,
the old man looked up in horror and said,
“What! Did I miss the fish bell?” and rushed
off as fast as he could.
The catch
Fish are even more important to the
numerous island-dwellers of the Aegean Sea.
Few of these rocky outcrops are capable of
raising substantial crops, and most foodstuffs
have to be imported at great expense from
the mainland, while the readily available
seafood is cheap.
Large quantities of sardines are caught in
Phaleron Bay at Piraeus.As the least
expensive fish, sardines form a large part of
the poorer classes’ diet. For the better off,
tunny is also plentiful, but the most prized
are the great eels that are brought from Lake
Kopaïs in Boeotia. Salted and smoked fish
are brought in from the Black Sea ports and
the colonies of the Spanish coast.
Fishing is a serious business
The Greeks mainly use nets for fishing, but
they also angle with hooks and lines. Squid
and octopuses are caught by spearing them
with tridents, usually at night by the light of
torches.
Small sailing boats, crewed by up to ten
men, go out at night and fish with nets and
torches that attract the fish.The boats are
usually owned by a single family, and the
crewmen are paid for their work either in
cash from the eventual sale, or in kind by a
share of the catch. Sometimes a cooperative
owns a boat between several poorer
fishermen. No one regards fishing as a
recreational activity; it is always a serious
business and, besides, the proper sport for
young aristocrats is hunting.
The Abundant Sea
With such a long coastline and so many islands, it comes as
no surprise that fish is a popular item in the Greek diet,
especially for the poorer classes.
Fishermen on 
the Gulf of Corinth
A fishing boat has just
pulled into shore to
unload a catch. One
man has already arrived
to start bargaining
before the fish reach
the agora, hoping to get
the best for his family.
A young boy fishes with
a line and hook, holding
a landing basket in one
hand. He has set a
larger basket in the
water to hold the
caught fish, which
keeps them fresh until
he gets them home.
In the foreground, a
fish-seller carries 
a basket laden with
herring toward the
agora. A pair of tunny
fish are secured to the
carrying pole over his
friend’s shoulders.
Life has not changed
much in 2500 years—
this modern Greek
fisherman attracts fish
using an electrically
powered light in place
of the flaming torch the
ancients would use.
Fact box
The modern Greek word for “fish,” psari, is
derived from the ancient Greek word opsarion,
meaning “delicacy.”

B
read plays a very important role in every-
day life. Common breads for ordinary
meals are made by kneading flour with
water, or with water and honey, sometimes
with oil or honey and wine (oinomelo).The
breads vary in the manner of baking as well
as in shape, and whether they are “raised” by
using grape yeast or left unleavened.
By adding fresh or dried fruit, cheese and
herbs, or olives, many different luxury breads
are made, especially for festivals and holidays.
The Greeks have more than 50 kinds of
bread. In the cities, public bakeries and ovens
are built by the government for everyone’s
use and they have become popular places for
men to visit the neighbors and discuss the
state of affairs.
Three meals a day
Most food is produced in the region around
the polis, although maritime cities like Athens
also import luxury goods and foreign
delicacies.Typically, Greeks eat three meals a
day, in the early morning, at midday, and in
the evening. Breakfast is normally a light
meal—bread dipped in wine or a lump of
cheese is common at all levels of society.
Lunch is a little more substantial, often
including olives, figs, cheese, bread, and wine.
The main meal of the day is dinner, usually a
barley porridge accompanied by fresh and
cooked vegetables.
Among the wealthy, dinner often involves
inviting male friends home for a meal, or
even eating at a “dining club” (equivalent of
a restaurant).The evening meal is eaten
while reclining on an anaklintra (couch), and
slaves bring food, wine, and finger bowls to
the diners.The women of the household are
excluded from these formal dinners, except
as slaves or as hetairai (see page 43).
Meat for the table
Although sheep, pigs, goats, and some cattle
are raised for the table, meat is a luxury.At
home, a family is more than happy to have
the occasional sausage or perhaps a locally
trapped hare. Pheasants and chickens are
available to boost at least one meal a week,
and cheese made from the milk of sheep and
goats is produced in great volume.
Fish, shellfish, squid, and eels are
consumed in many different ways: fried,
baked, stewed, dried, and smoked. Richer
families may extend their diet to caviar,
oysters, and turtles.
38
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Putting Food on the Table
For the average Greek, the main diet is simple, and largely
free of meat because of its expense. But dining in a wealthier
home provides a huge variety of appetizing dishes.
Two men lounge outside
a civic bakery and chat
as they wait for their
loaves of bread to finish
baking. A boy brings a
bag of grain to hand
over to get bread made
for his family.

Preserving for the winter
Fruit and vegetables are readily available fresh
during the summer. Fruits are eaten in all
possible manners, while vegetables—if not
cooked in a stew—are preferred raw with an
olive oil dressing. In the late summer, it is
necessary to preserve fruit and vegetables for
the winter. Fruit is preserved by sun-drying
and then packing it in clay jars, or by placing
fruits in honey, carefully ensuring that no
one fruit touches another. Green vegetables
are preserved simply, by putting them in a
vessel treated with pitch.
In a wealthy home, any meat—such as
wild game, freshly caught fish, and pork—is
hung in the chimney, where the fires of the
kitchen “smoke” and preserve it for later
consumption (see illustration on pages 52–53,
point 6).
Seasonings and flavorings
The Greeks love to combine sweet and sour
flavors, the basic ones being honey, vinegar,
and garos (a sauce based on fermented salted
fish). Many herbs and spices are also used—
mustard, coriander (cilantro), cumin,
oregano, dill, parsley, mint, pine nuts, poppy
seeds, sesame, fennel, and aniseed are among
the most popular seasonings.And few Greek
meals remain unflavored by garlic and
onions.
The Greek general and historian
Xenophon amusingly remembers how the
guests at a dinner laughed at the newly-wed
young man who refused his portion of
onions in order to keep his
breath sweet for his bride.

T
he symposium (a feast or formal meal) of
wealthy men—usually held at home—is
typically Greek. Eating and drinking is a
social activity, an opportunity to meet others
and discuss politics, listen to music, play
games, and enjoy companionship.A
symposium often lasts from the early
afternoon until late at night.
Men are the only guests, because—apart
from eating and drinking—the important
part of a symposium is the conversation about
philosophical, artistic, and political matters.
These are mental exercises fit for men, but
not for women, who the Greeks believe
cannot understand these subjects properly.
As the guests lie down on their anaklintra
(couch), slaves serve oinomelo, wine mixed
with honey, and bread.The dishes then
follow in a strict order. First come several
appetizers and fruit, then fresh fish and meat
prepared in several interesting ways.
The symposium’s second phase is called the
epidorpion, which means dessert, but it is
much more than a selection of sweets.
Several kinds of pies, sweets, dried fruits,
nuts, and cheeses are brought in.
A popular sweet is baklava, the baked
confection of nuts and honey between layers
of thin bread dough that Greek mercenary
soldiers brought back from Assyria centuries
before.Along with these delights comes the
most important item—more wine.
40
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Wine and the Symposium
Wine is the common drink of poor and rich alike, but wines
vary in quality and therefore in price. Among the wealthy,
drinking wine is an important part of the evening banquet.
A symposium in its final
stage: as the guests
nibble sweets, more
wine is served, and
entertainers take to the
floor to bring the night’s
meal to a merry close.

Mixing wine and water
The host decides how much water should be
mixed with the wine.Wine, stored in an
amphora vessel, is strained through fine cloth
to catch sediment deposited from the
fermentation process, to be mixed with
water in a large vessel called a krater.The
mixture is then transferred from the krater to
a jug called an oinchoe for pouring into cups.
In general, the dilution starts with several
parts of water to one part of wine, but as the
evening progresses the wine begins to
dominate, until the guests are drinking their
wine undiluted.
The host is responsible for getting his
guests drunk, but not before they have
enjoyed debate and argument, and recited
poetry.As they become less capable of speech,
the entertainment begins—professional
dancers, musicians, even acrobat performances.
With the symposium concluded, the host
can retire to his bedchamber, while his guests
stumble to their homes, their way lit by
slaves bearing torches.
The importance of wine
The success of a symposium reflects on the
status and wealth of the host, never more so
than in the quality of his wine.The best
wines come from the Aegean islands,
especially Lesbos and Chios.Wine is available
in the three basic types—
white, red, and “black” (a
very deep-bodied red
wine).
It is categorized as
being sweet, the
honeyed, the
ripe, and the
soft.The very
expensive black
wines are so heavy that is
only sensible to dilute
them with water—at
least at the start of a
symposium!
To the Greeks,
wine-drinking is more
than an enjoyment, it also has religious
symbolism—it is the only drink able to
soothe even the quarrelsome gods of
Olympus. Dionysus, god of fertility, wine,
and theater, is honored at the time of the
grape harvest and when the first new wines
are ready to drink in February.
This, the most important Dionysian
festival, is called the Anthesteria and it
celebrates the god through processions and
wine-drinking contests (see also page 47) in
what is effectively a week-long symposium—
but with the difference that women may
attend the festivities.

Lawrence Alma-Tadema
painted a Dionysian
festival scene (below).
Behind the female
dancers, a celebrant
has slumped under the
influence of the wine.

W
ith the exception of Sparta (see “The
Spartan difference”), Greek women
have very limited freedom outside the home,
and have no legal and few social rights.The
kyrios or head of the household (the father,
husband, or other male relative) legally owns
all the women under his roof, an ownership
that passes from father to husband when a
daughter marries.
Women have no right to vote or to legal
help, and with few exceptions they may not
own or inherit property.The role of a wife is
to run the household, bear children and take
care of them, manage slaves and servants, and
attend to her husband’s needs.
Stuck at home
She is a virtual prisoner within her home
and rarely leaves it, except during certain
religious festivals, such as the Panathenaic
Procession and the festivals of Dionysus.
Other special occasions are few, beyond
attending weddings and funerals, and visiting
female neighbors for brief periods.
Wives of poorer citizens may be more
fortunate than those who are better off, since
they sometimes have to work outside of the
home as servants or craftspeople. On the
other hand, in a family with few or no
slaves, the poor housewife has to do almost
everything, whereas women do not do the
housework in a wealthier home.
The housewife’s day
Female slaves look after the cooking,
cleaning, and work in the fields.A male slave
watches the door, to make sure no one
comes in when the husband is away, and
another acts as a paedogogus (tutor) to the
young male children.
Women do not even go out to do the
shopping. It is the task of men to leave for
the agora in the morning to shop for daily
requirements such as fish, cheese, olives, and
vegetables, and occasional luxuries such as
trinket boxes and jewelry.
A woman’s day is mostly spent in her
quarters, called the gynaeceum, spinning yarn
and weaving. She makes all the clothes for
the family and the slaves, hangings to
brighten the walls and cover the windows,
bed blankets and cushions. Fortunately, this is
not viewed as being a boring job, but is
considered a noble task, even for aristocratic
wives and daughters.
Young girls are expected to spend their
day with their mothers, learning how to run
the home and to spin and weave, ready for
the time when they get married.
42
CHAPTER 3
The Family—the Role of Women
Greek women are more subordinate to men than even those in Mesopotamia or
Egypt. From the poorest to the richest homes, women are considered the property
of their father, and later of their husband, and are treated accordingly.
The Greeks at Home and Work

The right of life and death
The head of the family has complete control
over the household, including grandparents,
unmarried sisters, widowed aunts, and any
orphans. His wife has no legal rights, even
over her children. If the family cannot afford
to feed another mouth, or a child is sickly or
deformed, the father can decide to leave a
newborn infant on a remote mountainside
to die.
With this level of power, it is not
surprising that women are considered
untouchable by any other than their
husbands. But it is not so for the men, or for
the one type of female who might be
considered to be free, the hetaira.
The Spartan difference
The role of women in warlike Sparta is
quite different from other parts of Greece.
There, women can own property—in fact
more than a third of Spartan land is
owned by women—and daughters are
allowed to inherit as well as sons. Spartan
women are given a good education in
both the arts and athletics (something no
other Greek city would allow), and often
hold real political power within the polis.
The reasons for this difference can be
explained by Sparta’s warrior-nation
character.The nation, not the family, is the
center of life for every man. Boys leave
home to begin their military training at
the age of seven and because, as husbands,
men are rarely at home and take no part
in child-rearing, Spartan women are free
to take charge of almost everything
outside of the army.
43
The hetaira
Among men, the word
hetairos means a male
companion, and the use of
the word in a feminine
form—hetaira—implies that
female companions are expected
to be trained and sociable in a way
that wives are not. Hetairai are
professional courtesans who entertain
the male guests at a symposium.
They are expected to be good at reciting
poetry, playing music, and dancing. Most
importantly, they must be capable of
holding an intelligent conversation among
men—which means discussing
politics, philosophy, and the arts.
This is how Greek men divide
women.A hetaira is almost an
honorary male, a companion almost
as good as a man but blessed with
female beauty, whereas wives and
daughters are essentially property.
Apart from their maternal
qualifications to run a household, being
intelligent is considered unnecessary for
female relatives, any more than it is for a
slave. Even the celebrated philosopher
Aristotle writes that the ability to think is not
found in slaves, nor in women.

occasions when a
married woman goes

protection, and perhaps
another to fetch and

CHAPTER 3: THE GREEKS AT HOME AND WORK

W
hile married women rarely leave their
home, young girls are hardly ever let
out of its female quarters—they should
remain unseen even by male members of
their own family. (This is in sharp contrast to
Sparta, where young girls train openly at
sports with the young men.)
Girls are considered to have reached
marriageable age at puberty, and certainly
before 16. Given her housebound seclusion
there can be no question of courtship with a
prospective husband, and most couples never
even meet until the wedding day.When the
head of the household (kyrios) decides a
daughter is ready to be married, he chooses a
husband for her and negotiates with the
prospective bridegroom’s family.
The happy outcome of this is the gamos or
marriage, which happens in two parts, first
being the engeyesis or engagement ceremony.
Again, there is no romance involved—this is
a thorough and legally binding verbal
contract between the two families which
does not concern the girl.The engeyesis is
pledged by the future husband and the girl’s
father clasping hands.The agreement
includes settling a dowry 
(a gift from the bride’s family); all oaths are
sworn in front of witnesses.
A man is usually about 30 when he
decides to marry, so he is perfectly capable of
making up his own mind as to whom he
should marry—or more to the point, to
which family he should ally himself. He may
well consult his father about this; fathers
often arrange marriages for their sons in
order to strengthen the family position.
Status and self-interest are the main motives.
Purifying bride and groom
The second part—ekdosis, the marriage
ceremony—involves giving away the bride
to the groom.This begins on the evening
the bride moves to her new home and
consists of three important preparations. First
a sacrifice is made to the gods and goddesses
who protect the marriage-bed—Zeus, Hera,
Artemis, and Apollo.The sacrificial offering
usually consists of all the bride’s toys and any
objects associated with her childhood.
Next, a torchlit procession is led to a
special fountain known as a callirhoe to bring
back water in a long-necked vase called a
loutrophoros for the ritual sacred bath.
In his own home, the bridegroom also
ritually bathes in sacred water taken
from the fountain.
The wedding day
On the wedding day both
houses are decorated with
garlands of olive and laurel.After
a sacrifice in the bride’s house, she is
taken to the place of the wedding
feast accompanied by her sisters,
girlfriends, and her nympheutria
or maid of honor. From the
other direction comes the
bridegroom with his
parochos or best man.
Men and women are
seated apart at the
banquet, which includes
sesame cakes—a symbol
of fertility.After eating, the

Marriage and Divorce
For most Greeks, being in love is not a reason
for getting married. There are far more important
motives for a wedding than romance.
Ritual

and 
groom

guests offer their presents to the bride, and
then she is taken to her new home, riding in
a wagon pulled by mules or oxen.With her
she carries a sieve and a cooking gridiron—
symbols of her domestic role.
Relatives and friends follow on foot,
carrying torches to the music of flutes and
lyres.At the groom’s house, the couple are
showered with nuts and dried figs, and
offered a wedding cake made with sesame
and honey before they retire to the thalamos
or bridal chamber. Outside, the wedding
guests sing wedding songs as loudly as
possible to scare away evil spirits.
Divorce for men
A man can always divorce his wife—even 
if there is no real reason. But he is forced by
law to divorce her if she is caught
committing adultery, otherwise he is liable 
to iatimia—the loss of his rights as a citizen.
There is one check against an easy divorce:
a husband who returns his wife back to her
family home also has to return her dowry.
Greek men marry to have children, so
failure to bear any is a common reason for 
a man to divorce his wife. Daughters can
marry into other families, thus forming
alliances, but sons are needed to continue 
a father’s line and to bury him with full rites.
There must be at least one son to guarantee
the cult honors which he, the father,
performed for his ancestors, and which are
essential for the well-being of the dead.
Divorce for women
It is much harder for a woman to divorce a
husband, since she is presumed incapable of
managing her own affairs. She can appeal in
writing to the archon (minister) responsible
for justice, but her husband’s unfaithfulness is
not considered a reason for divorce because
Greek society accepts complete freedom for
men. If she can prove violence against her or
ill-treatment the archon may consent, but she
faces many problems.
A wife divorced by her husband may
return to her family home with little
disgrace, but everyone frowns on a woman
who divorces her husband. Shunned by
neighbors and even by family, there is little
future for her. Many such women are then
forced to become another man’s mistress or a
hetaira (see page 43).
45
CHAPTER 3: THE GREEKS AT HOME AND WORK
Below: A man can
divorce his wife and
send her back to her
own family, while
keeping their children

wedding procession, the
new couple reach the

Left: In Athens it is a
custom for a young
boy—whose parents
must still be alive—to
go about with a basket
of cakes and say, “I fled
from misfortune, I found
a better lot.” This
symbolizes the sensible
move the groom is
making in marrying and
starting his own family.

T
o avoid having too many children,
abortion and exposure of newborn
infants are practiced.Abortion is legal, since
the law considers the unborn child to be its
father’s property.A mother, however, needs
her husband’s consent for an abortion, and a
slave girl that her of her owner.
Infanticide is also allowed as long as the
child has not been named or accepted as a
member of society.The father does not kill
the child but abandons it—so weather,
starvation, or wild animals are responsible for
the death. Not all exposed children die—
sympathetic foster parents rescue some,
others are enslaved.The rescued baby is a
common theme in Greek mythology, the
most famous being that of King Oedipus,
who later returned home to unknowingly
kill his real father and marry his mother.
In harsh Sparta, newborn children are
presented to the elders and tested by
immersion in ice-cold water.Those who fail
through being weak or sickly are exposed on
Mount Taygetos in order to protect the
strength of the race.
Childbirth
Children are born at home, with all the
women of the household crowding around
the mother.The most experienced in
birthing helps with the delivery, but if there
is a problem a doctor or a midwife can be
summoned.
The world at large is informed of a birth
by the family hanging something over the
front door—an olive branch for a boy, a strip
of woolen material for a girl.A week after
the birth, a family festival known as the
amphidromia is held, a purification ceremony
for the mother and all those who helped
during her labor.
The ritual also admits the baby as a
member of its social group. From now on,
the child is an accepted member of the
community and the father no longer has the
right to end its life.
The baby is named on the tenth day after
its birth, with the family members all
assembled for another sacrifice and a
banquet.The relatives bring gifts for the
baby, in particular amulets for good luck.
46
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Birth and Children
Although a daughter may be desirable and a son essential,
the Greeks do not have large families because of poverty or
to avoid estates being divided among too many male heirs.
Above: A goose and
rider and a jointed doll
are just some of the
toys to amuse children.
Right: A boy plays with

cup decoration.
A grandmother prepares
to feed her daughter’s
hungry baby, which
cries for attention and
shakes its rattle. The
child’s high chair acts
as a potty too. Mother is
busy chatting with a
visiting friend.

Festivals and the phratria
Two important festivals mark the early life of
a boy when he is about three years old, the
Anthesteria and the Apatouria.The first is a
festival dedicated to Dionysus, and young
boys, crowned with flowers, are encouraged
to compete in the festival’s second-day event
known as Wine Jugs.
In this, the competitors are given a
measure of diluted wine in a special jug.At a
command, everyone empties their jugs, and
the first to finish drinking is the winner.
Adults taking part must drink almost half a
gallon, so it is as well that children are given
much smaller jugs!
The Apatouria is a gathering of the
father’s phratria (clan or family association) in
October, when the boy is introduced.The
Apatouria is a time to catch up on news,
make sacrifices, and register new members of
the family.The father swears that his son is
born to him of a citizen-mother, which
establishes the boy’s rights to citizenship later.
Toys and games
Greeks love to give their children presents of
toys, which they can buy from sellers in the
marketplace (agora). Some toys are made at
home by the children themselves—houses,
wagons, and ships out of strips of leather. In
a larger courtyard, or outside in the
farmyard, there may be swings, and boys play
with kites, hoops, model carts, whipping tops,
and wheels pulled along with poles.
While babies have rattles made from
hollow containers with pebbles inside to
entertain them, older boys play team games
with balls made of pigs’ bladders, whipped
along with sticks. Games of leapfrog,
piggyback, and blindman’s buff are all
enjoyed. But playtime comes to an end
when a boy reaches the age of seven, and it
is time for school to begin.
47
CHAPTER 3: THE GREEKS AT HOME AND WORK

O
nly a son can continue the family line.
As for his sister, once a girl is married
her future happiness is the responsibility of
her new husband and she is unlikely to see
her father again.As a result it is only the
boys who get a proper schooling.
Pupils living in cities are taught to become
productive members of their democratic
society. Because all male citizens are expected
to take an active part in debates, justice, and
local or city government, they must be fluent
in reading, writing, and basic arithmetic. In
country regions the level of education is
lower than in the cities.
Vocational training
Since most states imitate Athens’ institutions
and social organization, it is best to see how
education of boys is handled there.Athens
has no state-run education system, so
families unable to afford the cost of private
schooling apprentice their sons to a master
craftsman or a merchant.
The apprenticeship system encourages
youngsters to improve their education while
learning a useful trade.Apprenticeships, of at
least six years, are usually begun at 12 years
of age for such occupations as builder,
merchant, potter, carpenter, or shipwright.
48
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
A Boy’s Education
It is a father’s civic duty to provide for his
son’s education. After a care-free early childhood, boys are schooled to become
model citizens—statesmen or soldiers—while girls are prepared for marriage.
Above: Fragments of a
red-figured vase show a
school at work. To the

music. In the center, a
teacher holds up an

another boy to read out,

his paedogogus.
Left: A boy practices
writing with a stylus on
a three-leaf wax tablet.
Below: From the age of
12, physical education
becomes an important
part of schooling.

Privileged school network
For the sons of wealthier citizens, the
options are far more appealing.When he is
about seven, the boy is removed from his
nurse and given to the care of a paedogogus, a
selected household slave who accompanies
him everywhere and is permitted to punish
the boy if he behaves badly.
The paedogogus takes the boy to school
and stays with him to ensure he pays
attention to his lessons and works hard.
Classes are held in teachers’ private homes.
Since music is such an important part of life
in Greece, boys are also taught to sing and
play the lyre and flute.
There is a law that forbids children to be
on the streets in the hours of darkness, so
classes take place from about half an hour
after sunrise until half an hour before sunset.
This makes for a particularly long day in the
summer, but a mercifully short one in winter.
A girl’s education stops at the point her
brother starts school. Slave girls may teach
the finer points of manners and the skills
required to run a household, while her
mother teaches the arts of spinning and
weaving cloth.
From school to gymnasium
When he comes of age, every male Greek
citizen is expected to be a soldier at some
level, from hoplite (infantryman) to strategos
(general)—the army is the route to the highest
political positions.Therefore, physical fitness is
considered every bit as important as academic
learning, if not more so.
Once a boy reaches the age of 12, his
education expands to include
physical training, which now takes
precedence over any other subject.
The relative calm of the private
teacher’s home is replaced by
the noise and activity of the
local gymnasium. It gets its
name from the Greek word
gymnos, meaning “naked,”
for at this school the boys
undergo their physical
exercises without any
clothing as they learn to
compete with each
other and how to 
cooperate in teams.
49
CHAPTER 3: THE GREEKS AT HOME AND WORK
Hurrying home before it
grows dark, boys and
their paedogogi leave
school.
Education in Sparta
Like his Athenian counterpart, a Spartan
boy is taken from his family at the age of
seven. However, his education is
completely different. He is raised in a
dormitory class, where his group learns the
skills needed to become first-class soldiers.
Conditions are literally spartan. Clothing
is minimal even in the harshest winter,
punishments severe, and academic tuition
almost non-existent. Spartans are trained to
accept tough campaign conditions without
complaining. Food is strictly rationed as a
part of this hardship training.The youths
are often hungry enough to steal. If caught,
the child is punished severely—not for
stealing, but for being caught in the act.
At 12, boys are introduced to military
training, which continues until the trainee
reaches 20 years of age. Most youths are
accepted into the army, while those that
fail to make the grade serve in military
administration and form a pool of reservists.
There is no other option than a life in
the army for a Spartan man, until he is
either too old to serve or dies in battle—
whichever is the sooner.
A hungry boy stole a fox and hid it under his
cloak. But the fox began biting him. Rather than
be caught out, the boy gritted his teeth and let the
fox tear at his stomach until it killed him.

A
ll gymnasia are centered around an open-
air sports ground called a palaestra—
which takes its name from the principal
exercise of pale (wrestling).A paedotribes
teaches the boys gymnastics—with the aid of
a long stick when necessary.They limber up
to music, then compete in sports such as
wrestling, running, and discus- and javelin-
throwing.With exercises concluded, the class
retires to a bathhouse to clean up.
Academic lessons take place in the cool of
the covered arcade, or colonnade, that
surrounds the palaestra, with classes arranged
by age, taking turns in lessons and physical
training. In Athens the older youths might
also attend an academy for tutoring in the
finer disciplines, such as appreciation and
participation in music, science, and the arts.
Athens is a society that emphasizes cultural
development.
Coming of age
Schooling lasts for about 12 years, ending at
the age of 18, but boys are considered to
have come of age at 16. On the third day of
Apatouria, October’s family gathering, a boy
cuts his hair to show that his childhood is
over.And once he has completed his last two
years in the gymnasium, the young man is
eligible for military training and special
education in religious and political duties.
His first task as a man is to report to and
register his name with his deme (local
community) and prove his right to
citizenship. Normally, this is a formality, since
his father will have registered this right with
his clan (phratria) when the boy was aged
three (see page 47).
50
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
The Gymnasium and Military Training
Between the ages of 12 and 18, boys undergo rigorous physical training while still
fitting in lessons between bouts of exercise. It is a system designed to create fit,
healthy, and educated leaders of men.
A healthy mind in a
healthy body is the
Greek ideal. In a busy
gymnasium, one group
of youths are put
through their paces by
the paedotribes on the
palaestra, while
teachers give academic
lessons under the cool
shade of a colonnade.

Becoming a full citizen
An ephebos may continue his academic
education while he is under military
instruction, if he wishes to.This is
administered by sophists (“wise men”) hired
for the purpose.These roving tutors advise
on the skills considered vital for civic
advancement and statesmanship—oratory,
persuasion, rhetoric, reasoning, philosophy,
and logic.
Many sophists have set up their own
institutes of higher learning, the most famous
of which is the Academy run by Plato.The
result is a breed of skilled young civic
leaders, eager to further their political and
military careers through the advancement of
Athens.These leaders have helped shape all
of Greece and share responsibility for its
successes and failures.
At the age of 20 a youth is no longer an
ephebos. He can attend the ecclesia (citizens’
assembly) and begin his life as a citizen.
However, while he remains fit and healthy
he will continue to bear arms when the state
requires it (see page 80).
51
The oath of an ephebos
Youths between the ages of 18 and 20,
known as epheboi, are subject to the rigors of
army life.An ephebos spends two years of
military service on the frontiers of Attica, the
region surrounding Athens. He also plays an
important part in some religious events, such
as the Eleusinian Mysteries and the
Panathenaic Festival.Along with the other
newly conscripted recruits, he swears an
oath, binding on him as a citizen:
I I will not disgrace these sacred arms.
I I will not desert my companions in
battle.
I I will defend our sacred and public
institutions.
I I will leave my fatherland better and
greater, as far as I am able.
I I will obey the magistrates and the laws
and defend them against those who seek
to destroy them.
My witnesses are the gods… and the
boundaries of the fatherland.

U
nlike the Greeks’ marvellous temples,
ordinary houses are built of mud
bricks.There are few windows to the
outside, and the heart of the home is the
courtyard.This open space may be large in
farm-estate houses, but much smaller in
town houses like the one illustrated here.
The house usually has a single floor, with the
reception rooms, slave quarters, kitchen,
private rooms, and bedrooms surrounding
the courtyard. Some city houses boast an
upper floor for the family bedrooms.
Few homes have a bathroom.The men
bathe at the gymnasium, while women wash
in clay basins—bronze if the family can
afford it—often mounted on a pedestal.
Wives are expected to spend their lives in
isolation, permitted to run a household but
rarely allowed to mingle with people outside
the home. Even when the man of the house
entertains, his guests will be other men, and
they dine in a suite of rooms separate from
the rest of his family.

Greeks call
a burglar 
a “wall digger”
because in the
absence of 
windows, he 
simply burrows
through the flimsy 
mud walls.

A
ll Greek
clothing is
essentially made from
one or two large square pieces
of cloth flung skillfully around the body and
secured by a few well-placed pins.This
costume is easily adjusted—it can be
expanded into flowing draperies or
contracted into an easy working dress by a
few artful hitches.
The most common form of dress for both
men and women is the chiton, a large
rectangular tunic of wool or linen cloth,
extending to the knee for men and the ankle
for women.
Chiton and himation
With men the chiton’s left side is left open,
fastened by fibulae, elegantly wrought pins of
silver, gold, or bone. In the closed side there
is a slit for the arm.A girdle is usually worn
about the waist, and, if one wishes, the skirt
of the chiton may be pulled up through it,
and allowed to hang down in front, giving
the effect of a blouse.
The arms are left bare, as is the head,
although leather sandals, a hat, and a cloak
called a himation provide extra protection
from the elements when outdoors. Epheboi
cadets and younger men often wear another
shorter type of cloak called a chlamys,
particularly when out hunting or riding.
A lack of tailors
Men working at a trade frequently wear a
short skirt, belted at the waist, while a longer
version extending from the waist to the ankles
is sometimes worn in the evening at a feast
(symposium). Male nudity is not considered
scandalous, particularly when taking part in
sporting events, at the baths, or in the home.
A man’s simple woolen garments have
usually been slowly and laboriously spun and
woven by his wife and daughters, so they are
hard-wearing and last for a long time.And
fashions (at least in the cut of the garments)
seldom change.A consequence of this is that
there are very few Greek tailors, only cloth
merchants, bleachers, and dyers.
54
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
What the Greeks Wear
In a land where the climate is generally warm—frequently
extremely hot—and in which the human body is
considered a beautiful object, loose, flowing 
garments are desirable.
Woolen or flaxen tunics
(chiton, seen far right),
short for men, ankle-
length for women,
are the basic form of
clothing. The tunic is
complemented by a
long, flowing peplos for
women, sometimes
covered by a cloak or
himation (seen in red).
Outdoors, women
invariably cover their
heads with a veil or the
raised himation, but
they are shown here
uncovered so the
clothes may be easily
seen. Men may also
sport a himation
(brown) or the shorter
chlamys (blue).
Footwear ranges from
light sandals to sturdy
walking boots.
Workmen (above) and
laboring slaves usually
wear only a loincloth.

The ladies’ peplos
Women also wear a peplos over the chiton, a
long flowing robe, tubular in shape, that
ranges in design from the plain and simple to
the highly decorated.A peplos is placed over
the head and made to fit closely at the
shoulder with fasteners and held at the waist
with a girdle.The arms are left bare.The
lower edge is often finished with a colored
braid.The peplos is open at the right side and
hangs in folds from the shoulder.
Saffron yellow is a very popular color, but
clothes are also dyed violet, purple, or red.
Very dark blue colors, such as indigo,
indicate a person is in mourning.
Hairstyles
Once, men wore their hair long and sported
long beards, but now a much shorter cut is
popular, with a clean-shaven face or perhaps
neatly trimmed facial hair for older men.
Women usually cover their hair when out
of doors, either by pulling up the himation or
wearing a veil.Their hair is worn long, and
often dyed. Girls like to style theirs in a
flowing manner or in ringlets, but married
women usually wear their hair up, secured in
place by ribbons, pins, headbands, or scarves.
Bracelets, rings, earrings, necklaces and
cosmetics give more adornment. Eyes are
darkened with mascara, the skin paled with
lead powder and cheeks rouged. Creams and
beauty lotions are popular.
However, the modest matron wears
cosmetics with caution—an Athenian
comedy play observes:“If you go out in
summer, two streaks of black run from your
eyes; perspiration makes a red furrow from
your cheeks to your neck; and when your
hair touches your face it is blanched with
white lead.”

While women take a
bath at home, the men
use the baths at the
gymnasium.

G
reek pottery is intended for everyday
use, but as well as being functional it is
usually beautifully decorated with paintings.
These depict mythological scenes, famous
heroes and their deeds, sporting events, and
scenes of everyday life.
Skilled Greek potters are found in a city’s
kerameikos, or the pottery quarter.Their
workshops are usually quite small, employing
only five or six men. Here, they make large
storage jars, cooking pots, lamps, roof tiles,
and beautiful domestic ware such as vases,
plates, bowls, jugs, wine cups, and kraters for
mixing wine and water.
The more decorative pots are made by
two people—the potter and the artist who
paints it.
56
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Crafts and Trades—Pottery
There may be few tailors about, but the Greeks have many
other jobs to occupy them. The most widespread is the
craft of pottery, which the Greeks have raised to 
a high art form.
A wealthy foreigner, a
metic, shops for a gift in
the display area of this
Athenian pottery. The
rear of the house is a
hive of activity:
1. Most pots are made
on a wheel, with an
apprentice turning the
wheel for the potter.
2. Large, complex pots
are made in separate
pieces and joined
together. Handles are
shaped by hand and
joined on with wet slip
clay later.
3. Once the finished pot
has dried out, an artist
decorates it.
An amphora is a two-handled
storage jar for wine, oil, and
free-flowing commodities,
such as grain.
A hydria is a jar for fetching
water from public fountains.
It has three handles; two
short ones on the side for
lifting, and a third—here
facing directly out of the
picture—for pouring.
Calyx krater
1

The Athenians use two types of pottery
decoration.The first, black-figure ware,
fashionable from about 550–480 BCE, and
then red-figure ware, developed after 530
BCE.The red-figure technique is more
sophisticated but harder to paint. In both
techniques the artist paints what will be
black in the finished pot, so on a red-
figured pot the details are created by not
painting them, that is painting around
them making a drawing in reverse.
The areas that will be black are painted
with a mixture of clay, water and wood ash.
Small details can be scratched in this “slip”
to let the red show through.At a certain
point in the firing process, the kiln’s vents
are shut.This cuts off the oxygen supply
and causes a chemical reaction that turns
the whole pot black.When the temperature
drops and the vents are reopened, the areas
painted black stay black, but the rest of the
pot turns a clear red color.
57
Making black and red figure ware
A krater is a large vase for
mixing wine with water
before serving. The one
above is a volute krater.
From a krater, diluted wine
is  transferred into a jug
called an oinochoe, above,
ready to be poured into
wine cups.

The decorated
pots are fired
(baked) in
a beehive-
shaped kiln. It
has three
openings: a
loading door, a top
air vent, and a
furnace opening in
which wood or
charcoal is burned to
heat the kiln.

S
tatues are used to decorate temples and
people’s homes, to commemorate famous
men legendary and real, and to mark graves.
Five materials are used for sculpting—clay,
terracotta (which means “baked earth”),
wood, bronze, and stone (usually limestone
or marble).
The mountainous nature of Greece means
that there is plenty of stone available, but it is
difficult to transport from the quarries to the
sculptors’ workshops in the cities. Large
blocks are usually cut in the quarry to the
rough shape of the statue, to reduce its size
and weight.The detailed carving is then
done in a workshop.
A finished statue is painted in lifelike
colors, and sometimes colored glass, stone, or
ivory is inlaid for the eyes. Details such as
garlands, crowns, weapons, or horse tackle are
made of hammered or cast bronze and fitted
onto the stone.
58
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Crafts and Trades—Sculpture
The visitor to ancient Greece cannot help but notice how many 
statues greet the eye at every turn. These sculptures depict 
many different subjects, but most importantly the human form.

Parthenon, created by Phidias. Given the scale, it is
amazing to think it was made from ivory and gold.
Below: In a busy studio,
ready sculptures are
painted. The finished
work of the sculptor in
the foreground may 
be seen on 
page 74.
Wood, bronze, and terracotta
Wooden statues and carvings are suitable for
decorating a home, but because the wood
soon decays, it is not a popular material for
exterior use. Bronze statues are made in
three different ways (see page 60).
Terracotta is not suitable for large pieces,
and is mostly used for small figurines and
plaques for temples and homes. Perhaps
because of the material’s humble nature, the
most popular figurines depict scenes of
everyday life—barbers at work, a butcher
cutting meat, scenes in the home, and so on.
Small versions of
Athena made in clay are
popular souvenirs with
visitors to Athens.

CHAPTER 3: THE GREEKS AT HOME AND WORK
Early Greek sculptors
copied Egyptian poses
for statues of young
men, called kouroi.
As they became more
lifelike, there was an
interest in the nude
female form as well.
A superbly realistic

Clay toys
Although making figurines from clay is a
part of the potters’ art, there are potters
who specialise in this craft and rarely make
pots. Clay statuettes are both handmade and
turned out in quantity from baked clay
molds.The variety is astonishing. Figures of
horses—with and without riders—and dogs
are popular. Dolls, models of boats and
articles of food, miniature pots, household
furniture, even tiny roof tiles and mirrors
may be found on the modeler’s well-
stacked shelves, ready for sale to a doting
parent to delight his children.
Plaques in relief portraying deities,
priestesses, and warriors are mass-produced
for votive offerings at temples, especially
those of Asclepius, the god of healing (see
page 86).
The picture below,
based on a Corinthian
factory, shows the
model-maker pressing
clay into a mold. A
mold for a doll’s torso
and finished examples
can be seen beside
his hands. An
arrangement of
painted figurines
stands on the table to
the left. A boy carries
a tray of finished
figurines to the
storage shelves under
their protective roof.

Bronze
Copper arrives from Cyprus and the eastern
Mediterranean, and tin from the mines of
Spain, Brittany, and even far away Cornwall
in England.When the two are smelted
together, the bronze alloy is the result.
Bronze is used for many everyday items
such as kitchen utensils and ladies’ mirrors.
It is also a popular medium for statues. Early
statues were made from sheets of bronze
hammered over a wooden frame; later, small
statues were made from
solid metal cast in molds.
The “lost-wax”
casting method is used
for small statues and
especially for large ones
where the final weight
of the finished product
is greatly reduced by
being hollow, such as the
4th-century bronze horse
seen on the previous page.
In this, a rough shape is
made in clay. Bronze pins are
inserted and a detailed wax
model is built around the clay
core.The wax model is then
covered by an outer clay mold.
Next, the clay molds are fired in a
kiln and the heat melts away the
wax model, leaving a perfect
impression of its shape on the inside
of the outer mold (the inserted bronze
pins keep the central core in place as
the wax melts).
Next, molten bronze is poured in
between the outer mold and the inner core,
and when it has cooled, the outer clay mold
is cracked away to reveal the finished bronze
figure.The inner clay core is broken and
removed through a small hole in the statue’s
base. Bronze is also used to make military
armor (see pages 78–79), but for weapons
such as swords and spearheads, iron is a
much tougher metal.
Iron
Iron is more useful than bronze when it
comes to edged tools and weapons, as it can
be made harder and sharper. It was first used
in Greece in about 1050 BCE, but since then
manufacturing techniques have improved. In
iron-making, the furnace needs to be a much
higher temperature than for bronze.

Crafts and Trades—Metalworkers
The craftsmen who work in metals have their quarter near the temple of their
patron god, Hephaestus. Here, the air rings with the clamor of hammering and
smelting from the numerous small and large workshops.
The bronze
“Vix krater”
(named after the
French town where it
was discovered) is
huge. At 5.4 feet high, it
weighs 458 pounds,
and holds an amazing
317 gallons of wine—
enough for more than
20 symposiums!

hammering bronze over
wood.

Gold and silver
Precious metals are used to make jewelry,
luxury goods, and coins. Some statues are
made of ivory and gold, such as the statue of
Athena in the Parthenon illustrated on page
58.The most widespread use of silver is in
minting coins (see page 66).
Silver is mined at Laurion, near Athens,
and the city owns the workings, which are
leased out to private contractors.The
conditions are dreadful, with miners working
shifts of up to ten hours.The philosopher
Aristotle defines slaves as “possessions that
breathe, tools that happen to be alive,” and
the unluckiest slaves in Greece are those
forced to mine for silver at Laurion (below).

M
ost furniture in a Greek home is made
from wood, and its style varies little
between the poor and the wealthy—rich
people just have more ornate and highly
decorated furniture.The finest pieces are
intricately carved, and probably have inlays
of ivory, gold, and silver. Items such as
lampstands are made of bronze, with pottery
lamps on top.
The architect’s skill
Domestic architecture is of little interest to
the Greeks and private houses are relatively
simple affairs of mud brick. Instead, the
Greeks devote themselves to public
buildings.These provide a focus for both
civic pride and religious feelings—and the
more there are, the greater the city’s status.
A description of architectural styles and the
separate elements of a Greek temple may be
found on pages 24–25.
However, the construction of these public
monuments owes a great deal to the
engineering skills of carpenters, who must
build the scaffolding and erect the lifting
engines.And when the building is almost
complete, they are called on to provide the
roof frame and ceilings, which are usually
made of wood.
A public building essentially consists of
stone blocks and stone columns. Limestone
and marble are the normal materials, but
softer sandstone is also used in the western
colonies.The roughly hewn blocks arrive
from the quarry, and are shaped on the
ground by masons using hammers and chisels.
Columns are made of cylindrical pieces of
stone, called drums.The fluting grooves are
started while each drum is still on the
ground and only finished when an entire
column (of normally 11 drums) is in place.
Ropes and pulleys are used to haul the
heavy stone blocks to the building height.
They are then maneuvered into place with
levers. Each block has a pre-made groove cut
into its ends so it can be joined to the next
block by means of a piece of metal called a
cramp. It is joined to the cramps above and
below it with metal rods called dowels.
Column drums are also lifted by a block-
and-tackle pulley system.When the drum is
being prepared on the ground, the mason
leaves four spurs sticking out, and ropes are
passed around these for lifting. Once in
place, the stone spurs are knocked off.
When the blocks and drums are in place,
apprentice masons go around and polish their
surfaces with a hard stone and a lubricant.

LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Crafts and Trades—Carpentry and Architecture
Carpenters are divided into two trades—domestic and structural, the first 
making furniture, the second a vital part of the architect’s craft.
Seating
The commonest seat is
a stool, with either fixed
or folding legs and a
leather or woven cloth
seat.
Couches and beds

Storage
Wood is used for a
variety of chests and
smaller boxes to hold
personal items ranging
from jewelry to clothes
and bed linen.

Tables come in several
shapes and sizes, but
they are usually low so
that they can be pushed

are placed on top, and
beds have a cover.

CHAPTER 3: THE GREEKS AT HOME AND WORK
Building a temple
Two workmen at the
right lower the final
drum of a column into
position. The lower
drum has a block of
wood set in its center to
aid in alignment. The
columns are set up with
only rough fluting,
which is finished
afterward to ensure
precision jointing. The
lifting spurs will be
knocked off once the
drum is firmly in place.
In the foreground, other
workers maneuver a
block into position,
while a third gives the
blocks a fine finish. The
metal I-shaped cramps
securing the
unmortared blocks are
clearly visible.
Altars stood in the open
air, usually in front of a
temple, for purposes of
public worship and
sacrifice. Most were
simple stone slabs, but
could be as ornate as
the one above.
Common types of
public building
Above: Treasuries are small
temple-like buildings at
sanctuaries used for storing
valuable offerings, such as war
booty in honor of a god.
A tholos is a round
building or temple with
a conical roof. In Athens
the prytani meet in the
Tholos (see page 71).
A stoa, or porch, is a
building forming a
walkway on one or two
floors, with open
colonnades at the front,
often used for shops or
offices.
Right: Votive statues are erected
to honor famous events or
heroes.
A propylaea, or propylon, is an elaborate
gateway to a religious sanctuary, such as
the one on the Acropolis of Athens.

A
t the heart of every Greek city is the
agora. It is the center of a city’s
commercial life, and a social focus where
people gather to meet friends.The finest
agora in all Greece is found in Athens, which
was once the place where an ancient race
track existed for the annual religious games.
Gradually, it developed into a market, and
from there to the political hub of the city.
Farmers from the surrounding region still
come to the central open space, erect their
stalls, and sell meat, poultry, fish, vegetables,
cheese, fruit, and eggs.Around the edges
craftsmen have their numerous workshops,
while here and there knots of men looking
for work gather in spots where employers are
known to hire for particular trades.
The political hub
To the east and south are the great stoas, or
porches, colonnaded arcades that offer
welcome shade and also provide space for
small shops and business offices.The shops
are open rooms with a counter across the
front, and since they cost more to rent than a
market stall, they tend to sell luxury goods.
On the western side of the agora sit the
various government buildings that house the
Boule (see below and page 71) and the
Strategion.This is the center of the Athenian
military command. In times of war, the Boule
appoints a supreme commander—the
strategos—who is responsible for the navy and
the army. In other times, there were a
number of strategoi, who acted as generals.
Together with altars and temples, you have
in one place the essence of a Greek city.

exchanging gossip, debating matters of state, and for public
discussion. It is the center of trade and of politics, where the

T
he first coins arrived a long time ago at
the end of the 7th century BCE from a
small state called Lydia, in Asia Minor.With
their capital at Sardis, the Lydians traded
with the Greeks of the Ionian coast, and
from there the use of coins spread to all of
Greece and its colonies.
Early coins made of electrum—a naturally
occurring alloy of gold and silver—may still
be found in circulation in backward places,
but most coins are made of gold or silver,
which guarantees the purity of each coin.
It is a matter of pride for a Greek city-
state to mint its own coins, which is a sign of
its independence.The only exception to this
used to be Sparta, which continued to use
iron rods instead of coins until the 4th
century BCE.
66
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Money Makes Trade Easier
Neither Mesopotamians nor Egyptians used coins for trade,
but the Greeks do. While a barter system still operates in
poorer rural regions, coinage is the currency of the agora.
The first Greek coins were stamped from lumps of
electrum with the symbol of the issuing polis to show that
their weight and purity were guaranteed by the state.
After 480 BCE, the human face and intricate scenes began
to appear, due to better minting techniques.
In 600–480 BCE animals most commonly appeared on
coins, usually the symbol of the issuing polis or
associated with the city’s main religious cult.
In the Hellenistic Period, coin quality improved and
heads of rulers began to appear.

The city-state ensures people shopping in
the agora are not cheated by its traders.At
Athens, the official standard weights and
measures are kept in the Tholos, the circular
building next to the Bouleuterion. From
here, the various officials take their weights
and measuring jars into the agora to check
against those being used by traders.
Ten metronomoi are chosen annually to
check the weights and measures.Their
colleagues, the agoranomoi, check the quality
of goods on sale, and the sitophylakes look
after the grain trade.The
grain trade is so vital to the
economy—since Athens has
to import two-thirds of what
it needs from the Greek
colonies—that it is a capital
offense to be caught
exporting any grain.
Above: A standard
measure jar and, right,
a typical trader’s stone
weight.
Standardizing weights and measures

The insistence of cities to issue their own
coinage means that merchants who want to
trade with another city have to go to a
money changer before any business can be
done.They earn their keep by charging a fee
for exchanging one currency for another.
In the agora of every city, money-
changers—called trapezitae, or “table men”—
can be found at their distinctive tables
touting for business. Competition is steep,
with each attempting to offer better rates of
exchange than their neighbors. Despite this,
trapezitae do very well, and some have
become so rich that they can afford to lend
money to merchants and citizens.
In Athens, privately owned trapezae, or
banks, have become an essential part of long-
distance trade.To feed its citizens the city
requires hundreds of ship cargoes.Almost all
of these cargoes are dependent on loans.
Because the trapezae have arrangements
with fellow bankers in distant ports, a
merchant can travel with a trusted guarantee
from his own bank to pay the seller’s bank at
the other end, in return for paying interest
on his loan. In this way he avoids the
dangers and inconvenience of transporting
large and heavy amounts of cash with him.
The innovation of banking has
revolutionized trade, and made Athens and
its port of Piraeus the most important
mercantile centers in the Mediterranean.
67
Money exchange and banking
The business of
changing money is
usually done by Metics,
or foreign residents.
They are happy that the
fiercely independent
Greek city-states all
issue their own coinage
because the money-
changers make a profit
on every transaction.

T
here are many safe harbors along the
Greek coasts, and most merchant-
captains are happy to take fees for carrying
passengers. Sea travel has its risks, however.
Storms are common—and so are shipwrecks.
Ships can be stranded from lack of wind or
driven off course. Pirates are a plague; and
unscrupulous captains have been known to
rob their passengers once they have put out
to sea.
The sensible sea-voyager lines up at the
altar near the harbor to make a sacrifice to
Poseidon to ensure a successful trip.
The merchant ship
Few merchant ships have much of a
superstructure, so there is no
accommodation, although the captain might
fit out a small cabin for himself on a larger
vessel. Merchant ships are not large, so they
rarely sail during bad weather. Shipping hugs
the shores to be close to land should a storm
arise, and to put in at night, with the crew
and any passengers sleeping on the beach.
Metics and slaves
Foreigners living and working in Greek
cities (which includes Greeks from other
city-states) are called Metics.They form an
essential part of the state—Athens alone has
25,000 Metics.The majority are merchants—
few Athenians enter into mercantile trade
themselves—who manage the shipping and
import businesses that make Athens rich.
Metics also include artisans, physicians,
philosophers, teachers, and leading artists.
However, although Metics as non-citizens
are not allowed to own property or land, and
may not vote, they pay taxes and can be
called up for military service in times of need.
Slaves come below Metics, but they also
form a vital part of the economic and social
structure.There may be as many as 100,000
slaves in Athens and Attica—roughly half of
the entire population. Elsewhere, slaves are
not so numerous.
The trade in slaves is a busy one. Slaves
come from all over the known world, but
particularly from around the shores of the
Black Sea,Thrace, the Middle East, and along
the coast of Asia Minor.
Most slaves are well treated and have some
rights under Athenian law.They may even
have an income, and their ranks include
highly skilled craftsmen. However, slaves
employed in the silver mines of Laurion
work in terrible conditions where their life
expectancy is very short.

carefully designed to
allow for tight stacking

destination, the

Land travel
The good roads in Greece usually only
connect a city with the neighboring
religious centers, such as Athens and Eleusis.
The rest are in poor condition, most barely
more than tracks, and there are hardly any
bridges spanning rivers, which means land
travel is hard.Taking into account the
continual wars between states and the
brigands who control the lonelier areas, and
overland journeys are also dangerous.
Oxen-drawn carts are used over
short distances, and usually near a
major town where the road
surface might be reasonable.
Longer distances require
donkeys or mules, accustomed
to carrying heavy weights
over poor and hilly terrain.
For most travelers a
journey means going on foot,
in groups to deter bandit attacks,
or well armed if alone. Major routes
offer some inns for overnight
accommodation, but they provide only a
bed, not meals, which means travelers must
carry food supplies in addition to any other
baggage.Travelers may arrange to stay with
relatives along their route, and in towns they
can sleep under the colonnades of public
buildings.

CHAPTER 4: PEACE AND WAR
The diolkos of Corinth
Although the isthmus of Corinth is narrow,
the height of the rocky land makes it
impossible to dig a canal. Instead, the clever
Corinthians have constructed a diolkos—a
paved slipway—connecting the Saronic
Gulf to the Gulf of Corinth.This cuts over
185 nautical miles off a ship’s journey
between the Aegean and Adriatic Seas.
Ships are borne by slaves across the
isthmus on a wheeled vehicle called an
olkos.The diolkos itself is a 10-foot wide
pavement of limestone blocks.

T
hanks to the political reforms of the
statesman Cleisthenes (c.570–c.508 BCE),
Athenians enjoy democracy and have the
right to vote on administrative matters and
to run for election to public office. However,
only registered citizens of the polis enjoy this
right—all other social groups, such as
women, Metics, and slaves, are excluded.
A citizen must belong to a local community
of Attica and be registered with his tribe.
The local organization of Attica
Based on the reorganization of Cleisthenes,
Attica (Athens and the surrounding area), is
divided into 170 demes (local communities),
each with its own demarchos (mayor) and
local government.All eligible voters are
listed according to their deme, even if they
move to another part of the state.
According to ancient custom, each man
also belongs to a phyle, or tribe. In Attica
there are ten phylae, each named for a
legendary hero of Attica’s history.
The phylae are political

A member of the

units, since each phyle is given demes in
approximately equal proportion.This creates
ten political blocks, each containing
approximately 17 local demes.
The demes within each tribe are further
divided into trittyes (thirds), based on three
geographical groupings: City, Coast, or Plain
(inland Attica).The result of this elegant
division is that each deme contains a cross-
section of the people, both urban and rural.
Because the phylae are scattered across
Attica, they have to cooperate with their
fellow phylae in different locations to
safeguard their collective tribal interests.
The system is complicated, but the map on
the left helps to explain how it works.
The Council 
Each phyle elects 50 men (a political
block known as a prytani) to serve on
the 500-strong Boule (Council).To
ensure fairness between the tribes, every
36 days one prytani is selected on a tribal
basis to take responsibility for the day-to-
day running of the state.The prytani on
duty sits in the Bouleuterion in the
Athenian agora and the men take their
meals at the state’s expense in the Tholos,
which they must keep manned day and
night to deal with any emergencies.
The primary function of the boule is to
draw up new laws and policies to put to the
Assembly of the people.
The Assembly
Every citizen has the right to speak and to
vote at the ekklesia, or Assembly, which meets
about once every ten days on a hill called the
Pnyx (see also the map on page 65).The ekklesia
debates proposals put forward by the council,
and decisions such as the allocation of public
money, declaration of war, or the forming of
an alliance are decided by the vote.
Of course, not every one of the 40,000
citizens in Attica can get to the Pnyx every
time there is a vote, and the usual number
present is more like the minimum 6000
necessary for a vote to take place. If too few
people attend, slaves in the state’s pay are sent
out in groups holding ropes dipped in red
paint to round up latecomers and shirkers.
Anyone found with red paint on his clothes
is shamed and fined.
71
CHAPTER 4: PEACE AND WAR
Government in
Sparta
The Spartan
government
includes a
monarchy—
unlike other
states, which have
no king—a
council of elders,
and a popular
assembly. Sparta
has two royal
families and two
kings, who rule
together. Kings
are responsible for
leading the army
in war; at home,
their powers are
limited to
religious duties.
The gerousia
(council) is made
up of the two
kings and 20
councillors, men
over the age of 60
who are elected
for life by the
apella, or Assembly.
The apella consists
of all citizens over
the age of 30.
Unlike the
Athenian Ekklesia,
the Apella cannot
debate or amend a
measure
submitted by the
gerousia, only vote
“yes” or “no.”

The archons
Nine officials or ministers called archons are
selected annually by lot from among the
citizens to prepare legal cases for trial in the
ekklesia and organize religious ceremonies.
Three archons are more important than the
others and have special duties.
The Polemarch Archon is charged to deal
with the legal affairs of Metics. He is also in
charge of games and offerings in honor of
men killed in battle.
The Eponymous Archon chooses the men
who are to finance the choral and drama
contests of the Dionysian festival (see pages
90–91). He also handles lawsuits involving
inheritance.
The most senior, the Basileus Archon,
presides over the court specially set up to try
murder cases, which hears cases on the
Areopagus hill. He also arranges religious
sacrifices, rents out temple lands, and
supervises the Dionysia.
72
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
A Democrat’s Duties

responsibilities. It is every citizen’s duty to take an active part in how the

League’s fighting funds

Below: The strategos
Themistocles leads the
Athenian army against
the Persian invaders.
The strategoi
The highest-ranking state officials are the ten
strategoi, or generals, one representing each
phyle, elected by the citizens. Holding office
for a year—though he can be re-elected
many times—a strategos wields immense
power over both the army and the economy,
implements decisions voted on by the Boule
abroad and at home, and acts as an
ambassador to other Greek states and foreign
countries.A strategos answers to the Assembly
for his actions and for the money he spends.
The power of Pericles
The most famous strategos is Pericles, leader
of Athens in the mid-5th century. He took
power after the Persian Wars and forged an
alliance of friendly cities into an Athenian
empire.This was known as the Delian
League because its treasury was initially kept
on the island of Delos. But Pericles
contrived to have it moved to
Athens, where it is kept in
the Parthenon—one of
the many fine buildings
Pericles had built with
the league’s money.

73
CHAPTER 4: PEACE AND WAR
Left: Jurors give their
verdict by handing in a
disk with a solid center
for innocent or a hollow
center for guilty.
Themistocles was
ostracized when he fell
out of favor with
powerful politicians. The
ostrakon pictured here
is one that a citizen
handed in as his vote to 
exile the strategos.
The law
It is every citizen’s duty to participate in the
running of the legal system, and they
exercise great power through the law courts.
Strategoi who lose battles can be brought to
trial to account for their failures. Petty
litigation is widespread, especially over
property and inheritances.
All citizens over the age of 30 are
expected to volunteer for jury service.A
small payment is made by the state to make
up for lost earnings and to ensure that even
poorer citizens may take part.There are no
attorneys or judges, but a presiding archon
sees that a case is properly tried, while
offering no opinion on the matter.
A minimum of 201 jurors is required at a
trial, selected from the volunteers using a
kleroteria machine. Each side is then allowed
equal time to present its case.This is
measured against a water clock, and when a
speaker’s time has run out, he has to stop
immediately.
Each juror is given two bronze disks, one
with a solid center (innocent), the other
hollow in the middle (guilty).At the trial’s
end, the jurors hand the appropriate disk to
an official and a simple majority decides the
accused’s fate.
Justice is administered by the city officials,
and punishments include death, mutilation,
imprisonment, house arrest, fining, and exile.
Pot punishment—ostracism
Exile is a common means of punishing
criminals and getting rid of unpopular
figures—usually politicians.A vote of
ostracism is held once every year in the
Assembly. Each citizen who attends scratches
the name of the person he wants to see
exiled on a piece of broken pottery, called an
ostrakon.
A minimum of 6000 votes is required for a
man to be banished, or “ostracized,” and the
unlucky citizen has to leave Athens within ten
days and remain in exile
for ten years.
A kleroteria machine
stands outside every
court, which is used to
select jurors. Athenian
citizens place bronze
identification tickets
called pinakia in the
slots. Black and white
balls dropped randomly
into a tube at the side
determine which row of
citizens will serve on a
jury for the day.

T
he Greek passion for athleticism is
rooted in civic pride and the idea that
fitness is a civic responsibility. From the age
of 12, every son of a citizen is expected to
become proficient in all manner of athletic
sports, training with his gymnasium (see pages
49–51). Soldiers (or future soldiers) need to
be in prime physical condition to fight for
their polis.The sporting arenas and gymnasia
are an alternative to the barracks square, and
the emphasis on physical training
ensures that the majority of
young males will be fit
enough to fight.
74
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Athletics—Training for War
Athletics have a religious significance to the Greeks, but since every citizen
must be ready to take up arms for his city when called, maintaining a regime
of physical exercise is a duty as well as a pleasure.
Foot races
Being swift of foot is essential for any soldier,
whether in charging an enemy or fleeing to
fight another day. For this reason, running is
the oldest sporting event.Youths train for
three main races based on the length of the
standard Greek stadion (stadium), which is
about 600 feet long.The stade is one length,
the diaulos two lengths, and the mammoth
dolichos 20–24 lengths.
Skill contests
Throwing the discus and javelin form part of
the standard pentathlon competition and
rarely feature as standalone events. Javelins
are equipped with a thong wound around
the shaft.This gives the missile a rotary
motion that makes it fly a greater
distance.There are two kinds of
javelin event: throwing for distance
and throwing at a target from
horseback.The long jump is another
part of the pentathlon.To extend the length
of the jump the competitor carries a weight
in each hand which he swings while running
along the ramp.The weights are released just
before landing.
Pentathlon
This contest consists of five events: running,
wrestling, the long jump, and discus- and
javelin-throwing. It is designed to find the
best all-around athlete, and requires great
stamina. One of Greece’s most famous
sculptures is of a pentathlete throwing the
discus.
Pankration
This combination of boxing and wrestling is
very rough. It is not unusual for pankration
athletes to be seriously injured or even
killed.The event involves a series of paired
fights that continue until one of the athletes
concedes.Almost anything is allowed except
gouging the eyes and biting. Soldiers are
usually the best at this sport.
The sculptor Myron’s
Discobolus is a superb
image of the Greek
pentathlete.

75
CHAPTER 4: PEACE AND WAR
Equestrian events
The basic horse race is run over a distance of
about three-quarters of a mile. Jockeys ride
bareback and accidents are common.
Chariot races for teams of two or four
horses with one rider consist of 12 laps.As
many as 40 chariots take part, so exciting
collisions are frequent. Equestrian events are
exclusive to the aristocratic and wealthy
because entrants must own their horses.
The winners
Prizes given in many festival games such as
the Panathenaic are financially rewarding.
But in panhellenic events such as the
Olympics athletes seek only the honor of
taking part and the glory of winning.
Winners are presented with an olive wreath,
palm branches, and woolen ribbons.
To add to their prestige in the games,
some cities are happy to sponsor successful
sportsmen, and some athletes make a decent
living in this way.
Fact box
The marathon is a modern race. It was
conceived for the 1896 Olympics in Athens,
first Olympics of the modern era.The race
is said to commemorate the 26-mile run
from Marathon to Athens made by a
messenger in 490 BCE to inform the Boule
that the Athenian army had defeated the
Persians at the battle of Marathon.
Wrestling and boxing
The object in wrestling is to throw the
opponent so that his shoulder touches the
ground, while the adversary remains on his
feet.The first man to fall three times loses.
Tripping is allowed, but no punching. Boxers
bind their hands with soft ox-hide thongs for
protection.A contest can go on for several
hours and ends when one boxer concedes
defeat or loses consciousness. In both events
opponents are chosen at random, so athletes
of different weights and sizes 
may find themselves matched.
Cheats never prosper
Cheating does sometimes occur.The first
recorded Olympic cheat was Eupolus of
Thessaly who, in 384 BC, tried to fix his
boxing bout by bribing the judges. Some
cities bribe others’ athletes to throw a race or
discus shot. If a city is caught the heavy fine
is used to erect statues of Zeus along the
road leading to Olympia. Individual cheats
have their names inscribed on plaques at the
athletes’ entrance to the stadium.

76
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
International Peace—the Olympic Games
The Greeks celebrate several panhellenic games, involving 
competitors from across the country and its colonies, but the most 
prestigious are those held in honor of Zeus every four years 
at Olympia.

with a game of
ball, while

using weights,
which are also

n the year of the Olympic Games,
messengers travel all over Greece and the
colonies, announcing the date of the games
and inviting people to attend. In this sacred
festival, athletes perform for the gods as much
as for their city-state or themselves.Athletic
prowess is venerated, and Olympian heroes
are honored throughout the Greek world.
At the announcement all wars must stop
to allow competitors and spectators to travel
to Olympia and return home in safety.And
so for a few short weeks, the quarrelsome
Greek city-states bond into a united whole.
A mystical place of peace
Olympia, situated in the northwestern
Peloponnese, is recognized as a non-political
sanctuary. It sits in the sacred wood of Altis,
beneath the Hill of Cronus, named after the
father of Zeus. It is a place of mystery, myth,
religion, and legend—a fitting venue for
sporting heroes.
Olympia is an impressive complex specially
built for the games, at the heart of which
stands the great Temple of Zeus.
No women allowed
The athletes compete in the nude, as they do
at the gymnasium, and for this reason no
women may compete or even attend the
games. In fact, no woman may approach
Olympia during the games (see “Other
panhellenic games”).
Chariot racing is the only event a woman
may win if she owns a horse. She may not
actually race or be present to watch her
jockey take part. However, if her horse wins,
she will eventually receive the prize.
The order of events
Religious festivals and diplomatic gatherings
flank the central sporting events, so the
celebrations last for almost two weeks.
On the first day the opening ceremony
involves religious celebrations and sacrifices
to the gods. On the second day the stadion
race is held, the most prestigious contest of
the games.The stadion, surrounded by banks
capable of seating about 40,000 spectators,
serves as the focal point for most of the
Olympic events.
Over the next three days the pentathlon,
wrestling, boxing, pankration, and equestrian
events are held, finishing with the dolichos
running race.When the last event has been
held, the prizes all awarded, the religious
celebrations concluded, the brief moment of
bonding and unity is over, and it is time to
pick up the many wars where they left off.
Other panhellenic games
The Isthmian Games are held every two
years in the isthmus of Corinth.The
location is symbolically important,
representing the unity of the
Peloponnesian Greeks with fellow Greeks
to the north.The Pythian Games are held
in Delphi every four years and are the
second-largest sporting event after the
Olympics.
A separate festival for women, the
Heraia, is held every four years in honor
of the goddess Hera. It consists of three
running events for girls of different age
groups.

good armor and weapons, and became
heavily armed foot soldiers, known as
hoplites. By the 7th century BCE, hoplites
dominated the Greek army.
The call-up
The ephebos has finished his two years’
military training; what can he expect as his
city goes to war? At the call of his tribal
strategos (general), he collects his military
equipment—which his slaves have
maintained in mint condition—and gathers
with others of his phyle (tribe) at an
appointed place.The state has not supplied
him with any equipment because it is his
honorable duty to provide all he needs to
protect his fields, home, and family.
A man’s wealth and social status
determines the quality of his armor and
weapons.As a result, he now stands in rank
with fellow citizens whose armor type and
quality varies considerably. Less wealthy
citizens who cannot afford arms and armor
are used as light infantrymen.Their function
is to harass the enemy, screen the hoplites, and
drive off other light troops.
W
hen a youth reaches the age of 20, his
military training ends (see pages
50–51) and he is no longer an ephebos. Until
he is 60 he will remain on the active service
list, although men over 50 are sent into the
reserves to be used in garrison duties.
Excepting Sparta, there are no professional
standing armies.When a city goes to war, its
citizens are called to the ranks, bringing their
own equipment and provisions with them.
Development of the hoplite
The warlord and his retinue of aristocratic
cavalrymen dominated armies before the
Archaic Period, supported by a few poorly
armed spearmen.While horses were
expensive and only aristocrats could afford
them, so was bronze armor and iron for
swords, which meant few men could afford
to be in an army.
In the Archaic Period (800-500 BCE), the
city-states developed and armed militia were
raised to defend their polis.
With increased trade, the middle classes
began to prosper.They could now afford

diameter, large enough
to protect his body from

inverted V for Sparta, a
gorgon’s head (among
other designs) for
Athens, and the club of
Hercules for Thebes.

linen cuirass, made of
many layers of material
glued together to form a

Helmets
Thracian and Attic: The later Thracian (left) and
Attic (right) helmets offer good visibility. The Attic
style will be adopted by Roman legionaries.
Corinthian: An early
style that made it
difficult for the wearer
to hear or see.
Illyrian: Made in two
pieces joined at the
crown with two
protective ridges along
either side of the
seam.
On the march
The hoplite must also bring his own food.
Typical rations include barleycorn, cheese,
wine, and salted meat and fish. Servants or
slaves accompany the army, carrying spare
weapons and provisions for their masters, and
cooking for them when fires are permitted.
During a march, the hoplite straps his shield
to his back, and clothing, bedding, or
provisions can be tied to it, or hung from the
end of his spear.
The Greeks march in long columns, with
the horse-drawn baggage in the middle. If an
attack is anticipated, they form a square to
protect the baggage in the center.
Camps are established each night or when
a battle seems imminent.These camps are
rarely fortified, and troops sleep in
formation, surrounding their supplies.
Sentries are posted to warn of attack.

T
he Spartan army is organized differently
from other Greek forces.The soldier
lives with his comrades in barracks, not with
his wife or family.The army is comprised of
six moroi (battalion-sized units).A mora,
commanded by a polemarch, is sub-divided
into four lochoi. Each lochos (company) of 144
men is led by a lochagos, and under him four
entomarchs command units of 36 men, known
as enemotia.
The whole army is commanded by one of
the Spartan kings.The first mora is the army’s
elite force and forms the king’s bodyguard.
Spartans march into battle accompanied
by helots (slaves), each carrying the armor
and weapons of one soldier. Spartan soldiers
are never expected to lose. If the unthinkable
should happen, they will die fighting rather
than retreat or surrender.
Athenian army organization
The Athenian army is formed by units from
each of the ten tribes of Attica, which is why
the word for “regiment” is the same as
“tribe”—phyle. Of the ten strategoi (generals),
only one or two are sent out into the field
with each military expedition.
Sacrifices and religious services are a
common aspect of campaign life, and omens
are interpreted to predict the outcome of
battles. Before fighting a battle, the strategoi
meet to discuss how and where to fight, and
sacrifices of livestock are offered to the gods
to ensure victory.
In most cases, the army forms into a single
line.The right wing of the line is the most
vulnerable to a flanking attack because the
soldiers at this end are partly unshielded (see
below). Since the enemy will be aware of this
weakness and attempt to exploit it, the most
experienced units are posted on the right of
the line.
The phalanx
Hoplites fight in a formation known as a
phalanx, a block of soldiers of between eight
and 12 ranks wide and more in depth.The
men are armed with the sarise (spear), which
turns a phalanx into a spiky battering ram.
When a soldier in the front line is
killed or injured, the man behind him
takes his place.The phalanx can also
form into a formidable hollow
square, defying any cavalry attack.
80
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
The Army in Battle
The most formidable army is that of
Sparta. This polis is designed to
support a permanent army, the
best fighting force in Greece.
Yet in battle, the hoplites of
Athens are often the
victors.
A Spartan soldier and

For the phalanx to be
effective, the men must
move as a unit. They
use flute music to help
keep in step. The man
seen above playing the
flute wears the Scythian
apparel typical of
Athenian archers.

The cavalry
Although hoplite foot soldiers form the bulk
of the army, horsemen are useful as scouts
and to break up enemy phalanxes. Each of
the ten Athenian tribes is responsible for
supplying one squadron of cavalry to a total
force of a thousand men and horses.The
cavalry is led by two commanders, called
hipparchs, each in control of five squadrons.
When present, cavalry is either split
between the two flanks or kept together as a
mobile reserve and used to scatter enemy
cavalry or light infantry that threatens to
disrupt the line.
Auxiliary soldiers
Poor men who cannot afford the armor and
weapons of a hoplite serve in lightly armed
auxiliary units.They include archers, stone
slingers, and pilsoi—men armed with clubs
and stone maces.
The peltast
Peltasts are based on the principal troops of
the Thracians, who found the combination
of fighting and skirmishing abilities suited
the rugged terrain of their homeland.The
peltast is a light infantryman but he is also
well armed.
Peltasts dash out from cover and hurl
javelins into a phalanx, and then retreat. If a
phalanx gets broken up, the peltasts go in and
pick off individual hoplites.To counter the
irritation of peltasts, fit, young hoplites called
ekdromoi (“runners-out”) run out of the
phalanx to drive them off.
81
On the charge, the first
five ranks lower their 
9-foot spears
horizontally, projecting a
lethal 6 feet ahead of
the front rank.

T
riremes measure between 120 and 135
feet long, with a width of about 15 feet.
The addition of an outrigger framework to
support the oars increases the width by 2.5
feet on each side.They carry crews of up to
200 men, of whom 170 are oarsmen.
The remainder consists of 12–15 sailors,
who man the sails or the steering oars, a
similar number of marines (including about
four archers), a flautist, whose rhythmic tones
help the rowers keep in time, and the ship’s
commander, known as the trierarch.
The trierarch is usually a rich man, chosen
by the state to pay for the running of the
ship for one year, which indicates what an
honor the role is for him.The same can be
said for the oarsmen, free men and
professional sailors mostly recruited from
among the poorer citizens. However, in the
time of war, even the elite are honored to
man the oars of a Greek warship
Three tiers of rowers
The rowers each use a single 14-foot long
oar, and they are arranged in three banks,
one above the other. On each side of the
typical galley, 27 oarsmen known as thalamites
form the lowest of the three tiers.These
rowers place their oars through circular
rowing ports.
The next tier of 27 oarsmen, zygites, sit
above and slightly further outboard of the
thalamites.Above them a top tier of 31
rowers, thranites, sit slightly outboard of the
zygites, resting their oars on the outrigger
frame.
Bulwarks (usually open at the upper level)
protect the rowing benches, but above them
the deck is partially covered, providing a
broad fighting platform for hoplites, javelin
men, and archers.A pair of helmsmen steer
the trireme with a large oar at each side,
However, the length and shape of the hull
makes turning extremely slow, unless the
oarsmen help in the maneuver by counter-
steering on one side of the vessel.
82
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
The Navy
Unlike the landlocked states of inland Greece, Athens bases
her power mainly on her navy. The fast fighting ship of the
fleet is the trireme, maneuverable and deadly in battle.
Early Greek warships
The earliest—and smallest—type of long,
low galley ship was the pentaconter (seen
above, passing a cargo ship) powered by 
25 oarsmen on either side.The ships
described by Homer in his Iliad and
Odyssey are biremes, galleys rowed by a
hundred oarsmen, in two banks of 25 oars
per side.Although fragile vessels, they
were fitted with a projecting bronze beak
for ramming enemy vessels. By the mid-
6th century a third bank of rowers had
been added to the typical warship, creating
the trireme. By the end of the century the
trireme had become the standard type of
war galley in the eastern Mediterranean.

No sailing at night
In ideal conditions, a trireme can travel
under oars at about 10mph, but speeds are
usually lower, due to fatigue, barnacle-
encrusted hulls, and bad weather.A single
central mast fitted with a simple square sail
helps the rowers during long voyages, but
both mast and sail are stowed before a battle
On long passages, the oarsmen work in
two or three watches, or work periods so
that they can get some rest.Triremes are
unsafe in stormy weather, and there is no
room onboard for the crew to cook or sleep,
so most ships hug the coast and find a
sheltered bay and beach for the night.
In battle
Triremes use ramming tactics, rowing at
speed into the flank of an enemy vessel to
pierce its hull with a metal-tipped ram.
When marines are carried, the trierach has
the rare option to engage in boarding
attacks. Otherwise, naval battles involve
searching for a weak point in an enemy
formation, then attacking, ramming, and
sinking the ships.
A favorite tactic is to row at full speed
toward the enemy ship, but swerve away at
the last moment.The rowers on the side
approaching the enemy vessel pull in their
oars and the trireme glides past the enemy
ship, breaking off its oars.The disabled ship
can then be rammed and boarded.

T
he earliest Greek writing system was
developed by the Minoan culture of
Crete. It was a form of hieroglyphic (picture)
writing, which evolved by about 2000 BCE.
By 1700 BCE, the Minoans had introduced a
second script, known to us as Linear A. Some
secrets of the hieroglyphs are understood, but
Linear A remains a mystery.
By the 15th century BCE the Mycenaean
Greeks had learned the art of writing from
the Minoans and developed a script known
as Linear B.With the coming of the Dark
Age in about 1100 BCE, when Mycenaean
civilization ended, the art of writing was lost.
When it was rediscovered in about 800
BCE, the new writing system came from the
Phoenicians, a proper alphabet developed
over centuries from Ugarit cuneiform, in
turn descended from that of the Sumerians.
However, the Phoenician alphabet contained
only consonants and the Greeks extended it
by adding vowels.The system was so
successful that Greeks were able to create the
most sophisticated literature of the time.The
word alphabet is derived from the first two
Greek letters, alpha and beta.
Lyrical poetry
The Greek alphabet and the development of
writing made literary composition possible.
The tales told by traveling poets of gods and
Mycenaean heroes were the first stories to
be written down.The most famous bard is
Homer, who at some time about 850–750
BCE retold in writing the traditional stories
of the Trojan War in his two epic poems, the
Iliad and the Odyssey.
Written poetry was first read aloud by
performers. Poetic recitations involved one
or more performers. Poems were sometimes
recited with dramatic flourish, and sometimes
sung.A musical accompaniment of flute or
lyre became common, leading to the
development of large choral works, including
religious odes, epitaphs for the dead, and
songs of celebration. Music, singing, poetry,
and prose eventually developed in the
greatest cultural achievement of the
Greeks—drama (see pages 90–93).

Early prose
The Greeks were the first people to record
their hopes, fears, and emotions in writing.
Prose developed later than poetry.
Philosophers, scientists, and historians used
prose to clarify their search for truth through
reasoned argument and observation. Later,
prose became a vehicle for dramatic
expression—the world’s first novels.
Although designed for the middle and
upper classes, they also show a sophistication
of emotion and description that makes them
timeless, and still relevant today.
Creating history
In the 5th century BCE, a series of Greek
writers produced the world’s first historical
narratives, free from mythology, religion, and
poetic license. Unlike other ancient histories,
this Greek historical writing attempts to
distinguish between fact and fiction and give
straightforward accounts of human endeavor.
Herodotus is considered to be the father
of modern history. He wrote his History in
about 440 BCE, detailing the recent war
between Greece and Persia.
In 404 BCE, the Athenian general
Thucydides wrote a history of the
Peloponnesian War between Athens and
Sparta. He gives an impartial account of
events, drawing on archived records, written
statements, and first-hand accounts in a
simple, direct, and concise style.
Thucydides died before the work was
completed, but an Athenian nobleman
named Xenophon finished it for him.
Xenophon went on to write his own
masterly Anabasis (up-country expedition),
covering the campaigns of a Greek
mercenary force against the Persians,
culminating in the Battle of Cunaxa (401)
and the retreat of the Greeks from
Mesopotamia to the coast of the Black Sea.
The tradition established by these first
Greek historians has provided modern
historians with a scholarly and literary
benchmark.
CHAPTER 5: CULTURE AND SCIENCE
Herodotus included
first-hand accounts and
personal memories. His
History is not only the
earliest example of pure
Greek prose to survive,
but also the world’s first
true history book.
Above: Thucydides was
a general in the
Peloponnesian War, but
his failure to relieve a
besieged Athenian-held
city in 424 BCE led to his
ostracism (see page 73)
from Athens. On his
return in 404, he wrote
his memoirs as the
history of a soldier.
Xenophon’s Anabasis
was based on his own
experiences as a soldier
marching against the
Persians. When the
Greek leaders were
betrayed and slain,
Xenophon took
command and brought
the Greek forces
safely home (right).

P
hilosophers are people who attempt to
explain man’s place in the scheme of
things and how people should behave or
what would be the ideal political system.
The basic elements
The first philosophers,Thales of Miletos,
Anaximines, and Empedocles the Sicilian,
argued about what substances were the most
important in the composition of the
universe—water, air, fire, or earth.
Pythagoras of Samos dominated the next
generation of Greek philosophers. In about
531 BCE he moved to the Greek colony of
Crotone in southern Italy, where he
established a religious academy.Apart from
his famous mathematical theorem,
Pythagoras advocated the portrayal of music
as a mathematical exercise.
The next school of philosophers sprang
up in Athens, when the statesman Pericles
(c.495–429 BCE) befriended Anaxagoras. His
pupils Democritus and Leucippus took the
debate about life a stage further, when they
argued that matter consisted of tiny atoms,
two millennia before the concept would be
taken seriously.
Socrates (469–399 BCE) questioned the
accepted order of society, morals, and
religion to such an extent that he was
considered a menace. Sentenced to death, he
elected to drink poison. Socrates was so
modest that when the Oracle of Delphi
pronounced him the wisest man in Greece,
he replied that his wisdom stemmed from his
acceptance that he knew nothing.
His greatest disciple, Plato (c.427–348
BCE), continued Socrates’ methods, but
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Philosophy and Medicine
Writing allowed philosophers to commit their arguments to 
paper. Through their clear, logical thinking, a new way of 
looking at the natural world has emerged, introducing 
rationality to the work of scientists, engineers, and doctors.
The god of healing
Asclepius (left), son of the god Apollo, was
brought up by a centaur (a mythical creature
that was half-man, half-horse), from whom
he learned the art of healing.Athena gave
Asclepius two bottles of magic blood.The
blood in one would kill anyone who drank
it, the other would bring the dead back to
life.Asclepius brought back so many people
from the Underworld that Hades
complained to Zeus. Zeus killed
Asclepius, but later relented and
brought him back to life,
and made him a god.
Dreams bring healing
Many Greek physicians are priests of
Asclepius, and there are temples dedicated to
him all over the Greek world.The two most
important are at Athens and the sanctuary of
Asclepius near the city of Epidaurus in the
southeast of the Peloponnese peninsula. Each
year a festival called the Epidauria is held in
his honor at Athens.
When people fall ill, they visit one of the
temples of Asclepius.After sacrifices and
purification ceremonies, the sick person is
allowed to sleep  in the temple for a night. It
is believed that Asclepius will heal them as
they sleep, or appear to them in a dream to
reveal what treatment would cure them.
By whatever means the cure is achieved,
the recovered patient leaves Asclepius
an offering as a tribute to the god
and gift for curing them.This
usually takes the form of a
terracotta plaque showing
the part of the person’s
body that has been made
better by the divine
intervention.
Pythagoras, famous for
his theorem.
86

exceeded his teacher’s achievements through
extensive writing. Plato tried to find the
ideal way of governing a polis and set out
detailed rules about how this could be done.
The Academy set up by Plato attracted
some of the most prominent Athenians of
the age, among whom was Aristotle (384-
322 BCE). He was also interested in man and
society and the ideal way to run a state, but
had a wide knowledge of natural history. His
most famous pupil was Alexander the Great.
In the 4th century BCE, Diogenes founded
the school of philosophers known as Cynics.
He lived very simply, and had no respect for
the rules of society. He attacked dishonesty
and excessive wealth. He lived so simply that
at one point his home was a storage jar.
The most enduring of Greek philosophers
were the Stoics, named after the stoa (porch)
in Athens’ marketplace where their founder
Zeno (or Xenon, 344–262 BCE) founded the
school of thought. He believed that if people
acted naturally they would behave well,
because the gods controlled their nature.
87
CHAPTER 5: CULTURE AND SCIENCE
Rational medicine
Following the example of philosophers,
many doctors have adopted a more scientific
approach to medicine and search for the
rational causes of disease, and try to learn
how the body works. For instance, it is
believed that blood is the carrier of many
common diseases, for which the remedy is to
bleed the patient.
More commonly, these modern physicians
prescribe herbal remedies, rest cures, special
diets, and exercise. Surgery, however, remains
a dangerous process and is usually avoided.
Even when the patient survives the operation,
infection often sets in and kills them.
The founder of this new medicine is
Hippocrates of Cos (460–377 BCE). He bases
his medical practice on observation and
rejects the popular view that illness is caused
by possession of evil spirits or a punishment
of the gods. Hippocrates teaches that the
body must be treated as a whole and not just
as a series of parts. He says that thoughts,
ideas, and feelings come from the brain, and
not the heart as other doctors believe.
Socrates
Aristotle
Alexander the Great
asked if there was
anything he could do for
the great Cynic. “Don’t
stand between me and
the sun,” said Diogenes.
Impressed by the reply,
the king said, “If I were
not Alexander, I should
wish to be Diogenes.”
Hippocrates, seen here
above, has separated
practical medicine from
religion. Through careful
study of the workings of
the human body,
medicine is losing its
elements of magic.
Anatomy and inquiry
play an ever larger role,
as surgical skills and
tools (left) steadily
improve. Hippocrates
uses treatments (right)
according to his ability
and judgment.

Archimedes (287–212 BCE), a native of
Syracuse in Sicily, invented an easy and fast
way to lift water from one level to another
for irrigation, in the form
of a large screw enclosed
in a tube.Water is lifted
by the screw as it is
turned.
Archimedes was
fascinated by the
physical properties of
water, and made his most
famous discovery while
taking a bath. He had filled
the bath too full and when he sat in it,
observed how the water rose up and
overflowed. From this he realized that an
object displaces its own volume of water.
Although levers have been in use since
prehistoric times,Archimedes was the first
scientist to explain the forces at work in
leverage. He developed complex calculus in
geometry, and also invented the most
fearsome weapon of its day—the catapult.

during the siege of
Syracuse. The great

Roman legionary after
Syracuse finally fell in
the same year.
T
o the Greeks, the study of philosophy
goes beyond pondering the composition
of the universe and the study of human
nature. Scientists and engineers are also
philosophers, which means “lovers of
knowledge.” By observing how things work,
Greek philosophers are able to make many
scientific discoveries.
Thales of Miletos (c.624–c.547 BCE) used
mathematics to calculate the height of the
Egyptian pyramids from a measurement of
the length of their shadows. It is said that he
was able to predict a solar eclipse, but he also
claimed that the earth floats on water.
About the same time,Anaximines figured
out that much of the planet had once been
covered in water and humans had developed
from an earlier creature (probably a fish).
The astronomer Aristarchus (310–230 BCE)
realized that the earth revolves on its axis
and circles the sun. Unfortunately, he did not
have the evidence to prove it.
Anaxagoras (c.500–428 BCE)
worked out that the moon’s light is
not its own but a reflection of the
sun’s. He also discovered that solar eclipses
are caused by the moon passing between the
earth and the sun, blocking out its light.

Telling the time with a water clock
89
CHAPTER 5: CULTURE AND SCIENCE
For the Greeks measuring time is not a
simple matter. Because the day (and night)
is divided into a given number of periods
(hours), it follows that throughout the year
these periods vary in length between the
longer summer days and shorter days of
winter. Greek engineers overcome this
problem by means of a clepsydra, or water
clock. By altering the
pressure on the inner cone,
more or less water flows
into the main chamber,
altering the rate at which
A continuous supply of water enters the clepsydra by pipe A, filling the hollow
cone B. By exerting pressure on lever C, solid cone D presses down on hollow
cone B, restricting the water flow. Surplus water flows out through pipe E.
Altering the pressure on the solid cone regulates the flow of water through pipe F
into the chamber. This alters the rate at which the float rises, and the rate at
which the ratchet turns the clock’s hand. For clarity, Roman numerals are shown.

the cork float rises. In effect it allows the
hours to go faster or slower for every day
of the year.
The philosopher Plato is said to have
invented a clepsydra with an alarm. Some
water clocks are constructions of
considerable size, requiring strong stone
foundations, like this one at Athens.
Aeolipile—the first steam engine
The aeolipile, or “wind ball,” is a steam engine
invented by a man named Heron, who lived in
Alexandria in the 1st century AD.
A sealed pot filled with water
is placed over a flame and
the water heated to boiling
point. Two tubes rising
from the top of the pot let
the steam flow into a
spherical metal ball. The
globe, which is free to
rotate on the inlet tubes,
has two curved outlet
tubes, which vent the
steam. As the steam
issues from the tubes, the
metal sphere rotates. The aeolipile has no practical
application; it is only an amusing toy.
Measuring distance accurately
Archimedes may have invented the odometer, a device that measures
the distance traveled by a wheeled vehicle, which the Romans later
used. It is described by a man named Vitruvius in about 27 BCE.A
wheel of 4-foot diameter
turns exactly 400 times in
one Roman mile. For each
revolution, a pin on the axle
engages a cogwheel with
400 teeth, and so makes a
complete revolution every
mile.This engages another
gear with holes around its
circumference in which sit
carefully graded pebbles.As
it rotates, pebbles arrive over
a tube, mile by mile, and drop into a counting box. The number of
miles traveled is given simply by counting the number of pebbles that
have dropped into the box.

The museum
The first museum is a
Greek invention. In
Alexandria there is a
temple to the Muses,
the nine goddesses who
inspire and guide
people’s creative
abilities, called the
Museion. Scholars from
all over the Greek world
travel to study there. The
Museion also houses a
great library that
contains copies of every
important Greek book
and many translations
of foreign books.
Engineers working at
the Museion have
invented many
interesting devices,
although several—such
as the aeolipile (see
above)—have little
functional use.

D
rama began as a countryside festival of
the fertility god Dionysus.The first
stages were the stone circles of a threshing
floor (see page 32), where the oxen and
mules “danced” over the cut wheat to
separate the grain from the stalks.The
threshing floor became the “dancing floor,”
or orchestra in Greek, and the natural place
for honoring Dionysus with song and dance
when the harvest was in.
The rural orchestra was always associated
with a small stone altar for sacrifices and
offerings, and nearby a small tent, or skene,
which might be decorated to add a backdrop
to the celebrations. From these humble
beginnings grew the great Greek theaters of
the 5th and 4th centuries BCE.
Rural rite to urban entertainment
The speed of transformation from a
countryside celebration into a fully-fledged
theatrical art form has been astonishing—
approximately 85 years.
In about 530 BCE, the tyrant Peisistratus
introduced a Dionysian festival at Athens,
and an artist named Thespis wrote a few
lines of dramatic dialog to be spoken
between an orator and a Dionysian chorus
on the orchestra.
Less than 50 years later in about 482, the
dramatist Aeschylus (525–456) introduced
the first written plays, involving troupes of
no more than three masked actors.
And 40 years after that, construction began
on the world’s first purpose-built theater, on
the lower slopes of the Acropolis of Athens,
next to the Temple of Dionysus Eleutherus.
By this time—known as the Golden Age
of Athens, under the leadership of Pericles—
the dialog between the actors has become
the most important part of the drama, with
the chorus only commenting on the action.
However, dramas remain religious in tone,
since early productions were a combination
of Dionysian worship and dramatic
presentation.
The theater festival of Athens
The Dionysia is one of the city’s most
important religious celebrations.The festival,
which lasts for five days, is a public holiday
so that everyone can attend.The first day is
devoted to processions and sacrifices.The
following four days are taken up with drama
competitions.
The man in charge of the Dionysia’s
organization is the Eponymous Archon (see
page 72). He picks the wealthy citizens,
called the choregoi, who have to pay for the
production of the plays.These are presented

LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
A Day at the Theater
In drama—the pinnacle of literature—the Greeks have
invented a new art form. Going to the theater is a religious
festival occasion and an entertaining day out.
Thespis was the first to
write a play using an
actor to speak a
dialog exchange
with the
chorus on
the
“dancing
floor.”
Aeschylus, the father of
modern theater.

comedies, with a sub-division of tragedy
known as a satyr play. Each year three tragedy
writers and five comedy writers enter their
plays into the contests.
Tragedies are usually about heroes of the
Mycenaean past.The sweeping themes are
grand, about human passions and conflicts,
the misuse of power, and whether or not to
bow to the will of the gods.After the earlier
Aeschylus, the two most popular tragic
writers are Euripides (484–406 BCE) and
Sophocles (496–406 BCE).
Comedies feature ordinary folk, with
commentaries on the politics and
personalities of the day.They are bawdy, full
of slapstick humor and rude jokes.The great
master of comic writing is Aristophanes
(448–c.380 BCE).
In the comedy competition, each author
enters one play. However, in the tragic
competition each author must enter three
tragedies and a satyr play.This is a play that
makes fun of the tragic theme (a style from
which we get the term “satirical”). In a satyr
play the people in the chorus dress as
satyrs—the wild followers of Dionysus who
were half-man and half-beast.
The actors
Performers and chorus members are all men.
Because of the flowing gowns and masks that hide
their faces, the emphasis is on speech, not action.
Tragic characters wear dark costumes, while comic
figures wear bright colors. The actors’ clothes are
padded, and large wigs and thick-soled shoes are
worn, to make actors easily seen in the huge theaters.
Masks
Actors wear painted masks of stiffened fabric or
cork. The expressions show the character’s age,
gender, and feelings. By switching from a “happy” to
a “tragic” mask, an actor can change mood instantly.
A performer can even change roles by swapping
masks. The expressions are greatly exaggerated to
make them visible, even from the back of the
theater. The large open mouths also act as amplifiers
for the actors’ voices.

CHAPTER 5: CULTURE AND SCIENCE
Fact box
From the name of
Thespis, who wrote
the first play with
dialog, we derive the
word “thespian,”
meaning actor.
“Drama” is a Greek
word meaning
“action.”
Euripides focuses on
the common emotions
and weaknesses of
mankind. The audience
can recognize
something of
themselves in his
characters. The tragic
finale often involves the
actors subjecting their
fate to the judgment of
the gods, emphasizing
the religious nature of
Dionysian plays.
Below: The comic plays
of Aristophanes are the
talk of Athens. They
contain attacks on the
pompous nature of
Athenian officials. He
uses much more action
on the stage than other
playwrights, catchy
music and lyrics, funny
recitations, and
enjoyably farcical plots.
His humor is irreverent,
democratic, and hugely
popular.
Above: The superb
characterization
employed by Sophocles
fires the imagination of
theatergoers. A master
of dramatic tension, he
brings his plays to
explosive conclusions
that thrill the audience.

A raised platform,
known as the logeion,
allows actors to stand
over the proceedings,
watching events on the
proskenion as if from
afar, and the entire
stage is covered with a
flat roof called the
theologeion. Rushes
dipped in a sulfurous
solution can be lit to
create dramatic light
and smoke effects. The
aeorema (crane),
permits actors to “fly”
onto the skene, usually
those playing the part of
a god. The ekeclema is
a wheeled platform for
presenting or removing
“dead” characters. This
is often used in
tragedies for showing
the audience characters
who have been killed
off-stage. A pair of
revolving periaktoi
(triangular pillars, not
shown) can be turned to
present a new item of
scenery and remove an
old one.
LIVING IN ANCIENT GREECE
Inside the theater
The koilon (or later theatron, “a place of seeing”) is
built in a half-circle of rising stone seating. The
blocks of seats are called cavea. The proedria—the
first (and lowest) row of seats—is reserved for
senior figures in the polis, visiting dignitaries, or for
priests. They are much more comfortable than the
ordinary benches for everyone else, but—whether
distinguished or ordinary—spectators usually bring
something soft to sit on because the stone seating
takes its toll on the hardiest backside!

CHAPTER 5: CULTURE AND SCIENCE
A theater’s main elements
Theaters in Greece share certain features.
Almost all are composed of three major
elements: the orchestra (chorus space), the
koilon (auditorium), and the skene (backdrop,
from which we derive the word “scene”).
Most action takes place on a raised platform,
or logeion.The orchestra is a circular, oval, or
sometimes rectangular space in front of the
logeion.The orchestra houses the chorus, with
its director—known as the koryphaios—
standing on a themili (originally the small
Dionysian altar of the threshing floor).
Although the logeion is the main stage,
actors tend to perform on its forward edge,
known as the proskenion (“in front of the
skene”).The sides and rear of the stage are
decorated with painted panels, or even
permanent walls, which hide actors standing
off stage from the audience.These backdrops
set the scene with depictions such as wooded
glades or mountaintops.
Between the skene and the audience seated
in the koilon, there are two walkways known
as the paradoi (entrance ways).The chorus
enters through one parados in solemn
procession at the play’s start, and actors enter
the theater through them, speaking or
singing as they walk on.
Symbolism is important.An actor arriving
on the skene from the left is deemed to have
come from the countryside, while one
arriving on the right has come from the sea
or a city. Behind the proskenion, two symbolic
doors allow actors to enter and exit the
action, moving through them from the
proskenion to the rear of the stage, or logeion,
where they are considered to be still in
scene, but not directly participating in it.
Bringing the past 
to vivid life
Principally, the Greek
theater is a place of
religious celebration. But in
its comedies and tragedies,
its satire and political
comment, its emotions and
ambitions, Greek drama portrays
the everyday lives of ordinary
as well as extraordinary
people of the time.
