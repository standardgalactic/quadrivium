Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5	
Foreword
Financial inclusion can almost be taken as a given in high-income countries, but 
access to finance often remains sporadic and informal in low- and middle-income 
countries. And yet, there is clear evidence that financial inclusion accelerates 
economic growth and enhances opportunities, especially among the poor. 
Communities thrive when households and local businesses gain access to finan-
cial services. 
In recognition of these benefits, the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund launched in 2015 the Universal Financial Access 2020 (UFA 
2020) initiative. UFA2020 aims to enable 2 billion financially excluded adults to 
gain access to transaction accounts. The initiative focuses on 25 countries where 
73 percent of all the financially excluded people live.
Three South Asian countries—Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan—account 
for  30 percent of the world’s financially excluded population and represent 
40 ­percent of the UFA2020 target population. Thus, the South Asia region draws 
particular attention when it comes to broadening access to finance.
India’s transformational efforts in implementing the Aadhaar financial inclu-
sion program and the unique identification program show that success is possible. 
Thanks to new technologies, transformative business models, and ambitious 
reforms, universal access to financial services has evolved from an aspirational 
goal to a target within reach. 
Improvements in the legal, regulatory, and institutional environments—which 
tend to be useful for development in general—can have a favorable effect on 
financial inclusion. Also, policy makers can promote financial inclusion by sup-
porting innovative business models that increase the outreach and lower the cost 
of payment and financial services.
Bringing E-money to the Poor: Successes and Failures reviews the experiences of 
countries that have demonstrated notable success in applying new technologies 
and institutional innovation to provide the poor and vulnerable with entry points 
into the financial system. Its case studies are based on extensive field research and 
interviews with financial sector practitioners, users, policy makers, and regulators. 
Detailed contextual analysis and an emphasis on critical conditions help identify 
the drivers of success, as well as the challenges and risks.
Although new technologies and innovative methodologies in the finance 
industry are numerous, the study focuses on e-money initiatives such as mobile

money, interoperable and multifunctional automated teller machines (ATMs), 
and prepaid debit cards for social grant programs. 
The four cases selected—Kenya, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—illus-
trate the importance of leadership by the authorities, innovation by the private 
sector, and a flexible “learn before regulating” approach. The result has been a 
transformative expansion of financial access not only to the poor but also 
throughout the economy, as these case studies show:
•	 In Kenya, the rate of financial inclusion more than doubled in five years to 
reach nearly 70–75 percent of the adult population. Innovation took the form 
of a mobile money application (M-Pesa) by the country’s leading mobile phone 
operator. A cooperative and enabling relationship between the regulator and 
the operator helped M-Pesa become the country’s retail payment platform. 
•	 In South Africa, the key innovation was the use of a biometrically secure, 
“chipped” open-debit MasterCard as the platform for social transfer payments. 
Financial access was extended to 10 million of the country’s poor, pushing 
financial inclusion up to 86 percent of the population. The essential element 
of success was the cooperation between the Social Security Agency, the private 
creator of the biometrically enabled card, and a local bank. 
•	 In Sri Lanka, a proactive development of the legislative framework enabled 
the establishment of an excellent payment systems infrastructure. Sri Lanka 
arguably has the best regulatory framework in the South Asia region to govern 
e-money for e-commerce and e-government, as well as the world’s first end-
to-end interoperable payment solution. A range of private sector players and 
mobile operators jumped in, and financial inclusion is already reaching over 
83 percent of the population. 
•	 In Thailand, 88 percent financial inclusion of households has been achieved 
through efficient coordination of strategies and policies toward payment ser-
vices and reduction of infrastructure costs. Thousands of multicapacity ATMs 
and automated deposit machines (ADMs) were deployed throughout the 
country as a result. The leadership of the Thai Bankers’ Association was a key 
element of this success. 
We hope that these rich case studies stimulate debate and encourage policy 
­makers, regulators, financial service providers, and mobile network operators to 
move forward on access to finance, especially for the poor. Their initiative, enthu-
siasm, and cooperation are needed to make universal financial inclusion a reality 
in South Asia.

Overview
I’m confident digital tools will allow us to ignite significant progress, opening a broader 
path to the goal of universal access to basic accounts by 2020. But access is just an 
interim step. The full benefit of financial inclusion depends on households and small 
businesses actively using a range of affordable and effective financial services, coupled 
with financial education and consumer protection. That is a much taller order.
—Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, United Nations Secretary-General’s 
Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development, UNSGSA Annual 
Report 2015
Background
Financial sector development can aid economic growth and create private and 
social benefits, especially in countries at lower levels of development (Cull, 
Ehrbeck, and Holle 2014; Sahay et al. 2015). An important aspect of financial 
development to address the shared prosperity objective is the extension of 
financial intermediation services to low-income brackets of the population.
Access to financial and payment services, including savings, credit, and social 
welfare transfers, facilitates better financial inclusion and enables improved 
income distribution and inclusive growth. Although financial inclusion is mostly 
a foregone conclusion in the developed world, in developing countries it often 
remains sporadic or at best informal for those at the base of the pyramid.1 
Limited financial inclusion severely impacts financial stability, financial security, 
and poor people’s economic mobility, thus effectively impeding the achievement 
of shared prosperity and development. The Global Financial Development Report 
2014 suggests that public policy can achieve potentially large effects on financial 
inclusion through reforms (World Bank 2014). The evidence provided from 
the  World Bank’s Doing Business data (World Bank 2017) and Enterprise 
Surveys2 indicates that improvements in the legal, regulatory, and institutional 
environments—which tend to be useful for development in general—can also 
have a favorable effect on financial inclusion.
The Universal Financial Access 2020 (UFA2020) goal to enable 2 billion 
financially excluded adults to gain access to a transaction account—an initia-
tive established during the 2015 World Bank and International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) Spring Meetings—focuses on 25 countries where 73 percent of 
all financially excluded people live (map O.1).3 The largest shares of unbanked

people are in India (which accounts for about 21 percent of the world’s finan-
cially excluded working-age population) and China (with about 12 percent). 
The other top-priority countries include Bangladesh and Pakistan, with about 
4 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of the world’s financially excluded 
population. Thus, three South Asian countries that account for 30 percent of 
the world’s financially excluded people represent 40 percent of the UFA2020 
target population.
South Asia plays a key role in the global development arena, with the 
world’s largest working-age population, a quarter of the world’s middle-class 
consumers, the world’s greatest number of poor and undernourished people, 
and several fragile states of global geopolitical importance. Led by India, 
strong inclusive growth in South Asia could potentially change the face of 
global poverty. Although the modern microfinance industry—which emerged 
in South Asia in the 1970s with organizations such as Grameen Bank of 
Bangladesh—has contributed meaningfully to expanding outreach and access 
in the region, data show that the number of people with access to formal 
financial services falls short of the potential that we associate with the 
impressive levels of financial access and inclusive growth in the emerging 
markets of East Asia.

Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5	
Demirgüç-Kunt, Beck, and Honohan (2008) show evidence that financial 
development and improved access to finance are likely not only to accelerate 
economic growth but also to reduce income inequality and poverty, and they 
describe how poor communities thrive economically when provided with access 
to financial services.
However, having more than 40 percent of the world’s financially excluded 
people, it is clear that in South Asia traditional banking has failed to adequately 
reach the poor and the financially vulnerable. On the other hand, technological 
innovations have responded to changing consumer behavior and tightened bank 
regulations by offering alternative means to achieve inclusive finance, with some 
clear success stories.
This study is based on case studies—developed through in-depth field visits 
and desk research—that analyze the implementation of specific e-money and 
other digital payment programs. The primary criterion for selection was the avail-
ability of relevant data to serve as evidence in analyzing the country’s experience. 
Countries were then selected that had demonstrated successful outcomes where 
critical enablers of success could be identified. In addition, countries were 
included that showed early promise but where critical constraints could be iden-
tified that stalled progress.
Motivation and Evidence
This study aims to identify countries that have demonstrated notable success in 
applying new e-money technologies and innovative thinking in providing first 
entry points into the financial system for poor and vulnerable population seg-
ments. Case studies are used to emphasize detailed contextual analysis of certain 
critical conditions and their relationships to the success or failure of these inter-
ventions. Although new technologies and innovative methodologies in the 
finance industry are numerous, the study narrowly focuses on e-money initiatives 
such as mobile money, interoperable and multifunctional automated teller 
machines (ATMs), and prepaid debit cards for social grant programs as the first 
entry points to financial inclusion.
The focus is on analyzing the provision of cost-effective, reliable, and safe access 
to basic cash-in/cash-out, utility, and bill payment services to financially unserved 
or underserved people through the selected e-money interventions. Although the 
study examines cases where financial intermediation activities such as credit, savings, 
insurance, and other financial products are developed through the e-money plat-
forms, it does not cover the entire spectrum of financial inclusion at these entry points.
The observed outcomes from four of the selected successful country case 
studies—Kenya, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—show that the private 
sector and nonbank entities have been supported or, in some cases, been led by 
flexibly designed policies and regulations, as in the following cases:
•	 In Kenya, the rate of financial inclusion more than doubled in five years 
to  reach nearly 70–75 percent (depending on methodology) of the adult 

4	
Overview

population as a direct result of innovations associated with a mobile money 
application (M-Pesa) that has evolved into the country’s retail payment plat-
form (FSD Kenya and CBK 2013).4 While also used ubiquitously by the 
banked and well-to-do, M-Pesa has especially benefited the poor and unbanked 
who previously had limited and costly access to traditional bank and financial 
infrastructure.
•	 In South Africa, the use of a biometrically secure, “chipped” open-debit 
MasterCard as the platform for social transfer (government-to-persons [G2P]) 
payments extends financial access to 10 million of the country’s poor.5 This is 
the main contributing factor to the growth in the country’s banked population 
from 63 percent in 2011 to 75 percent in 2014, with financial inclusion 
(adding those who use nonbank accounts for financial transactions) reaching 
86 percent (FinMark Trust 2014).
•	 In Sri Lanka, the government and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka have pro­
actively developed the country’s legislative framework, enabling the establish-
ment of an excellent payment systems infrastructure and possibly the best 
regulatory framework in the region to govern e-money for e-commerce and 
e-government. This policy approach has facilitated the launch of the world’s 
first end-to-end interoperable mobile payment solution as another means of 
enhancing financial inclusion that is already reaching over 83 percent of the 
population.6
•	 In Thailand, 88 percent financial inclusion of households has been achieved 
through efficient coordination of strategies and policies toward payment ser-
vices and reduction of infrastructure costs, partly through the deployment of 
thousands of multicapacity ATMs and automated deposit machines (ADMs) 
throughout the country (BOT 2014).7
This study also draws lessons from experiences in several other countries: 
India, Indonesia, Maldives, and the Philippines. Some of these countries have 
taken important initial steps to create the potential for rapid expansion of finan-
cial inclusion, while others have encountered obstacles that have limited their 
success.
In most instances, reform packages are country-specific. For this reason, 
there is considerable uncertainty as to which countries or initiatives reflect 
best practice. Nevertheless, pursuing cross-country studies of successful prac-
tices or policy initiatives, along with international dialogue, can flatten the 
learning curve and speed up policy learning by highlighting common traits, 
implementation issues, and operational successes. Furthermore, to effectively 
counter underlying barriers to financial access for underserved groups, even 
within a single country, it appears to be important to follow an integrated 
approach that considers the entire ecosystem at different stakeholder levels, 
as explained in chapter 3.
This study also aims to identify new approaches to improving financial 
inclusion in South Asia. It documents innovative uses of technology in the 
form of digital financial services operating within a balanced regulatory 

Overview

environment that can be key to improving financial inclusion. When an 
economy is cash-based, access to financial services is often restricted and 
costly. When countries move increasingly away from cash to a “cash-lite” 
economy—one in which “cash is no longer the most common means of pay-
ment” (BFA 2015)—broader financial inclusion can take place at a faster pace 
and lower cost. This is because a digital solution can often be more easily 
deployed to successfully address inclusion barriers and provide benefits in 
terms of proximity, safety, reliability, cost, and simplicity. These are hugely 
important concepts, especially for poor people. Technology or regulatory bal-
ance alone will not make an initiative successful unless it accrues one or more 
of these benefits to the users.
It is important to understand that although these initiatives represent 
exciting use of digital means in providing entry points to formal financial 
systems, they are but the first steps toward embarking on a journey toward a 
cash-lite economy. It is not an easy feat to develop inclusive digital financial 
systems and have a meaningful distribution effect among poor people, let 
alone reach the cash-lite or cashless stages that the developed countries have 
achieved. Although the viability of adopting digital solutions varies from 
market to market, these initiatives present a powerful opportunity to draw 
lessons to advance financial inclusion through efficient, affordable digital 
means.
Target Audience
The target audience for this study comprises national regulators, policy makers, 
and market practitioners of digital financial services, primarily in the South Asia 
region. Given the growing interest in e-money and digital payment solutions—and 
in light of ongoing initiatives in most South Asian countries—developing a 
knowledge-sharing platform both in the form of this volume and in a seminar 
would allow for an interactive knowledge exchange between practitioners from 
the case-study countries and their South Asian counterparts. The case study 
analysis, combined with descriptions of South Asian country financial and 
e-money landscapes, provides an excellent base for more-comprehensive diag-
nostic studies in the future on the digital financial potential of South Asian 
countries. Researchers, experts, and private sector service providers should also 
find the study informative.
Methodology: Country Selection and Financial Inclusion Status
Hawkins (1980) described an outlier as an observation that “deviates so much 
from other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a differ-
ent mechanism.” The selection of countries for the case studies was first triggered 
by the observance in the data of obvious outliers, as found in the Findex data,8 
combined with field visits and readings that confirmed that the chosen countries 
have indeed acted in different and innovative ways to achieve higher levels of 

6	
Overview

basic financial access for their poor populations by consciously developing the 
financial and payment ecosystem using digital means.
This selection process yielded six suitable countries (table O.1): four fast mov-
ers (Kenya, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Thailand) that have successfully pursued 
e-money initiatives that have also yielded transformational levels of financial 
inclusion, including use of e-money by the poorest;9 and two early movers 
(Maldives and the Philippines) where the momentum implementing e-money 
has stalled or failed to reach its full potential but remains promising. In addition, 
the study reviews the possible game-changing initiatives undertaken by a South 
Asian country and a Southeast Asian country where critical enablers could be 
identified but the outcomes cannot yet be documented: specifically, India’s 
establishment of a unique identification system and Indonesia’s steps to achieve 
interoperability among providers to help overcome geographic challenges to 
outreach.
These case studies offer in-depth analysis of the elements of some innovative 
e-money initiatives that have influenced project outcomes and digital financial 
landscapes in terms of expansion of financial access and inclusion. The analysis 
focuses on stakeholders at all levels, highlighting common critical elements or 
“game changers” that fast movers have implemented, but which the early movers 
overlooked, preventing them from reaching their full potential.
Summary of Findex Data
The 2014 Global Findex Survey data on each of these countries (see appen-
dix A) are used in the ex post outcome analysis. Table O.2 provides a com-
parative summary of country data on transactions (both inflow and outflow) 
that measure the use of, and hence the demand for, such accounts. These 
data points indicate the relationship between digital services and extension of 
payment services to underserved or poor populations and, also, shed light on 
the readiness of such countries and population segments to use digital 
technologies.

Note: — = not available. Not all questions were asked in all countries. The 2014 Global Findex Survey did not calculate global averages 
for these indicators.
Although promising outcomes are observed in each of the cases, the heavy 
presence of cash as the dominant choice of payments highlights the persistent 
challenges at the entry level of getting people to fully embrace e-money as 
the pathway to a fuller array of financial services including savings, credit, and 
insurance.

Highlights of Country-Specific Comparative Data
Kenya’s Findex data show the dominance of mobile-phone–based accounts 
and increased financial access driven by M-Pesa (appendix A, table A.3). 
The share of adults with a transaction account is high at nearly 75 percent,10 
and the shares of women and the poorest 40 percent who hold accounts are 
around 71 percent and 63 percent, respectively. The share of the adult popu-
lation with mobile accounts is 58 percent. These proportions are substan-
tially higher than the averages for Sub-Saharan Africa (11.5 percent), for 
low-income countries (10 percent), and even for the world (2 percent). 
The shares of remittances received and sent by mobile phone (89 percent 
and 92 percent, respectively) are comparatively higher than Sub-Saharan 
African averages (28 percent and 31 percent, respectively). The receipt and 
payment numbers confirm that, in Kenya, people prefer mobile money as a 
transaction method, while the use of cash still remains high. Government 
payments favor financial institutions, indicating scope for further expansion 
of mobile services.
Findex data for South Africa clearly highlight the use of card payments and 
the link of government grants to debit cards, with debit card ownership of 
around 55 percent (appendix A, table A.5). Use of debit cards is also high: 
41 percent of adults use them for payments, substantially higher than world 
and upper-middle-income country averages (23 percent and 20 percent, 
respectively). The shares of South Africans who send and receive remittances 
using money transfer operators are also high (57 percent and 61 percent, 
respectively). Government grants are channeled through financial institutions 
on bank-based debit cards. Wage payments go through financial institutions at 
a higher rate (27 percent) than in upper-middle-income countries and the 
world average (18 percent). Mobile money accounts are possessed by only 
14  percent of South Africa’s population, and cash still dominates payment 
transactions. Thus conditions are favorable for e-money to facilitate greater use 
of a wider range of financial services.
Sri Lanka’s financial inclusion indicators are impressively high across   all 
segments of the population (appendix A, table A.6). Even among the poorest 
40 percent, 80 percent are included—far ahead of the South Asia, 
lower-middle-income country, and world averages (38 percent, 33 percent, and 
54 percent, respectively). Although Sri Lanka has launched an innovative, 
interoperable mobile money solution, neither the inclusion numbers nor trans-
action volumes are driven by mobile money: only 0.1 percent of all adults have 
a mobile account. Financial institutions have provided accessibility to all segments 
of the population; hence mobile money is simply another option. Another fac-
tor is that mobile money was launched only recently (in 2012). In Sri Lanka, 
too, it is apparent that cash still plays a significant role and thus provides an 
opportunity for digital payments to expand.
Thailand also scores high on inclusion for all segments of the population: 
78 percent of all adults, 75 percent of women, and 72 percent of the poorest 
40 percent (appendix A, table A.7).11 ATM transactions are especially high: more

than 62 percent of adults identify ATMs as their main mode of withdrawal, com-
pared with the upper-middle-income country average of 56 percent. Nevertheless, 
people use ATMs mainly for cash withdrawal, even though banks have enabled 
these customized ATMs to also handle utility, travel, and person-to-person pay-
ments at relatively low cost. Although mobile money is available in Thailand, it 
is not used to a significant degree: only 1.3 percent of all adults have a mobile 
account. Debit card ownership is fairly high, at 55 percent, but debit card use 
(8 percent) is lower than the East Asia and Pacific, upper-middle-income country, 
and world averages (15 percent, 20 percent, and 23 percent, respectively).
In India, cash dominates all types of transactions, and financial inclusion 
numbers are comparatively low (appendix A, table A.1). However, the impact of 
the recent digital financial inclusion drive in India (described in Part II of this 
volume, chapters 4 and 6) is evident when the 2011 and 2014 numbers are com-
pared: adults with accounts increased from 35 percent in 2011 to 53 percent by 
2014. This impressive growth bodes well for achievement of the goals for 
UFA2020. However, the transaction comparison shows cash dominance in all 
areas, representing a challenge for the government and financial institutions alike. 
The share of adults with mobile accounts is 2.4 percent, comparing favorably to 
regional and world averages (2.6 percent and 2 percent, respectively), although 
transactions using mobile money are negligible (except for receipts of payments 
for agriculture products). Encouraging people to move away from cash would be 
a priority for India.
The Philippines is included as a case study because mobile money initiatives 
originated in the Philippines in 2001, long before Kenya’s M-Pesa mobile money 
platform started in 2007. Given the constraints on brick-and-mortar financial 
institutions due to the archipelagic nature of the country, one would have 
expected mobile money to flourish. However, only 4 percent of adults have 
mobile money accounts (appendix A, table A.4). While this rate is higher than 
the regional and lower-middle-income country averages (0.4 percent and 
2.5 percent, respectively), it compares poorly with the 28 percent of adults who have 
bank accounts. The Philippines’ total rate of financial inclusion—31 percent—is 
less than half the strong rate of financial inclusion in East Asia and the Pacific, 
where adult inclusion averages 69 percent. Remittance numbers are higher 
(34 percent receiving and 21 percent sending), but these are undertaken mainly 
through money transfer operators (mostly pawnshops). All transaction types 
reveal cash dominance. The discussion of the Philippines case study in Part II of 
this volume (chapters 4 and 6) will highlight the reasons why mobile money 
failed to gain traction.
The case of Indonesia, as noted earlier, represents achievement of interop-
erability to help overcome geographic challenges to inclusion. On most finan-
cial indicators, Indonesia remains below average in the region despite 
substantial progress between 2011 and 2014 (appendix A, table A.2). 
The share of adults with an account at a financial institution rose from 
20 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2014, still below the averages of 42 percent 
for lower-middle-income countries and 69 percent for East Asia and the Pacific.

Saving at a financial institution likewise rose from 15 percent to 27 percent, 
and the share of respondents with a debit card rose even more sharply from 
11 percent to 26 percent—comparable to lower-middle-income countries, 
although below the regional average. Digital transactions and use of mobile 
phones and money for remittances also are below average, although 
Indonesians make relatively high use of ATMs, which are the main mode of 
withdrawal for 71 percent of those with an account.
Maldives is not covered by Findex data. However, previous World Bank 
engagements show that the country’s archipelagic nature makes it difficult to 
provide financial access to the 340,000-plus people living among more than 
200 islands. Over half of the population is in the outer islands, and those living 
on atolls have great difficulties accessing banking and payment services. 
Although banking services are woefully inadequate, a World Bank–funded 
mobile-phone banking project closed without being able to successfully deploy 
the much-needed mobile solution. The World Bank and the local Maldives 
authorities are trying to address this issue through a different payment solution. 
The case study (in chapter 4) highlights important lessons learned from the 
past difficulties and problems encountered and the nonbank-based approach 
being undertaken.
Organization of This Volume
Following this “Overview” chapter, Part I of the volume provides the framework 
for studying the journey toward a cash-lite society and financial inclusion, as 
follows:
•	 Chapter 1, “The Challenge of Financial Inclusion,” introduces the topic of finan-
cial inclusion, discusses its importance, and presents definitions.
•	 Chapter 2, “Digitizing Financial Inclusion through Innovations,” explains how 
digitizing money, payments, and other financial transactions can facilitate 
inclusion of the unbanked and financially underserved population. It also 
addresses the risks of digital finance, including
•	 Political economy risks that stem from vested interests that resist the intro-
duction of disruptive technologies;
•	 Security risks and risks to the payments system, which may not function effec-
tively if the service providers do not adequately understand the digital cus-
tomer base or the infrastructure requirements;
•	 Principal-agent risks that must be addressed to minimize loss of revenue, 
fines and other reprimands by the regulators, fraudulent activities and cor-
ruption, and loss of reputation; and
•	 Risks to customers from inadequate information and understanding of 
e-money, lack of consumer protection and adequate redress mechanisms, 
identity theft, and liquidity-related issues, among others—all of which may 
account in part for the trust gap that impedes increased and broader use of

digital finance and the achievement of higher levels of financial inclusion 
beyond entry-level transactional and payment services.
•	 Chapter 3, “Stakeholders in Digital Financial Inclusion,” sets forth the key stake-
holders in the process of applying digital innovations to achieve greater finan-
cial inclusion.
Part II presents the empirical evidence on critical enablers that are game 
changers in successful e-money deployments, as follows:
•	 Chapter 4, “Policy Leadership and Enabling Regulatory Environments,” focuses 
on the macro environment, including leadership in policy and regulatory 
reforms that are both successful and less successful in achieving results in 
terms of financial inclusion.
•	 Chapter 5, “Innovative Uses of Infrastructure and Digital Ecosystems,” 
examines measures at the meso level (the institutional framework) to 
establish enabling infrastructure, institutions, and social grant payment 
systems that are essential alternative payment system platforms designed 
to drive demand and use by the poor and unbanked. In chapter 5, particu-
lar attention is paid to the micro-level private service providers and how 
they have responded and rapidly built up agent networks. Kenya’s unusu-
ally rich set of mobile money applications and private development of the 
digital ecosystem have allowed nonbank provision of payment services to 
include the poor in an array of credit, savings, insurance, and other finan-
cial products.
•	 Chapter 6, “Unique Identification,” looks at different experiences with national 
identification (ID) systems, because a unique national ID is found to be a criti-
cal condition to link e-money platforms and other digital solutions to bank 
accounts in order to transform financial inclusion of the poor, rural, and 
unbanked.
Part III draws on the lessons of experience to distill guiding principles for suc-
cess and measures that would help avoid deficiencies that have constrained the 
pace of scaling-up in several South Asian countries, as follows:
•	 Chapter 7, “Digital Landscape in South Asia,” summarizes the e-money land-
scape across countries in the South Asia region. Although such an overview 
cannot replace in-depth diagnostic assessment of how best to digitize the 
delivery of financial services in each country, it provides a basis for the discus-
sion in chapter 8.
•	 Chapter 8, “Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Options in South Asia,” sug-
gests key options that could be applied in South Asian countries.
•	 Chapter 9, “Conclusions,” reviews the conclusions regarding the critical enablers 
and game-changing measures for digital applications to help transform finan-
cial inclusion in developing countries more generally.

Notes
	 1.	Throughout this volume, “developing countries” refers to low- and middle-income 
economies as defined in the World Bank’s Income Classifications, based on estimates 
of gross national income (GNI) per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas 
method. As of July 1, 2016, low-income economies are those with 2015 GNI per 
capita of US$1,025 or less. Middle-income economies are those with 2015 GNI per 
capita of US$1,026 to US$12,475 (“upper-middle-income” economies having 2015 
GNI per capita of US$4,036 to US$12,475). “Developed countries” refers to 
high-income economies, which are those with 2015 GNI per capita of US$12,476 or 
more. Classification by income does not necessarily reflect development status.

my’s private sector. The surveys cover a broad range of business environment topics 
including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, crime, competition, and perfor-
mance measures. Since 2002, the World Bank has collected these data from face-to-
face interviews with top managers and business owners in over 155,000 companies in 
148 economies. For more information about the Enterprise Surveys, see http://www​

are not considered “excluded” in the BOT survey, so they are implicitly counted within 
the BOT (2014) “inclusion” figure.

The choice was made to pursue fieldwork and in-depth treatment of South Africa’s 
biometric chipped debit card program because it is considered a more flexible 
e-money product as an effective entry point into the financial system by the poor. 
That is, poor grant recipients can use their chipped card at any bank ATM or point of 
sale (POS). By comparison, the prepaid cards used in Mexico and Brazil are “closed 
loop” and are primarily used for identifying the grant beneficiary for cash-in/cash-out 
transactions at limited locations.

The Challenge of Financial Inclusion
What Is Financial Inclusion?
This chapter introduces the concept of financial inclusion and why it matters for 
development. The gaps in financial inclusion in South Asian countries are 
analyzed along several dimensions and are related to poverty status. Particular 
attention is paid to the role of remittance transfers.
Financial inclusion has gained greater prominence in recent years as a key 
priority in the reform and development agenda to achieve sustainable and 
inclusive economic growth. In 2009, the Group of Twenty (G20) included 
financial inclusion on its agenda (G20 2009); since that time, donor communi-
ties, standard-setting bodies, national-level policy-making and regulatory bod-
ies, and academia have embarked on various initiatives to further financial 
inclusion.
The benefits of financial inclusion are widely accepted. This volume does 
not aim to undertake a full-fledged literature review to explain the theoreti-
cal underpinnings of financial inclusion or evaluate the development benefits 
that would accrue from having inclusive, low-cost, accessible, and reliable 
financial systems. However, the relevance of financial inclusion to the devel-
oping world, especially to the South Asian countries that motivated this 
study, is described below with the financial inclusion gap as the axis for the 
analysis.
The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor’s (CGAP 2011) working defi-
nition of financial inclusion (box 1.1) explains the need to address access, 
use, and quality of service dimensions in order for a financial system to be 
truly inclusive. Two other important points are also highlighted: that certain 
groups are excluded by the financial system, and that exclusion happens in 
payments as well as in traditional intermediary markets such as savings, 
credit, and insurance.

Box 1.1  “Financial Inclusion”: A Working Definition
“Financial inclusion” refers to a state in which all working-age adults, including those currently 
excluded by the financial system, have effective access to the following financial services 
provided by formal institutions: credit, savings (defined broadly to include current accounts), 
payments, and insurance.
“Effective access” involves convenient and responsible service delivery, at a cost 
affordable to the customer and sustainable for the provider, with the result that finan-
cially excluded customers use formal financial services rather than existing informal 
options.
“Financially excluded” refers to those who do not have access to or are underserved by for-
mal financial services.
“Responsible delivery” involves both responsible market conduct by providers and 
effective financial consumer protection oversight.a The specific characteristics of 
excluded consumers have significant implications for effective consumer protection reg-
ulation and supervision, and therefore also for standards and guidance aimed at enabling 
financial inclusion. Relevant characteristics are likely to include limited experience with, 
and sometimes distrust in, formal financial service providers; lower levels of education 
and financial literacy and capability; few formal providers to choose from, if any; and 
remote locations.
“Formal institution” refers to a financial service provider that has a recognized legal status 
and includes entities (and, in some countries, even some individuals) with widely varying 
regulatory attributes, subject to differing levels and types of external oversight. However, 
the fact that a customer’s financial service provider has a recognized legal status does not 
mean she or he should be considered “financially included” under the definition used: for 
this, all the conditions of “effective access” must be met. Moreover, formal products and 
­providers do not in all cases offer customers a better value proposition than informal prod-
ucts and providers. The reality for many financially excluded households is that informal 
options may be the best they have available for the foreseeable future for at least some of 
their financial service needs.

a. “Responsible market conduct” by providers includes reasonable steps to ensure transparency and fair treatment, and to 
mitigate consumer risks.
According to Kempson and Whyley (1999a, 1999b), there are five major 
forms of exclusion:
•	 Access exclusion, where segments of the population remain excluded from the 
financial system because of either remoteness or the process of risk manage-
ment of the financial system
•	 Condition exclusion, when exclusion occurs because of conditions that are 
inappropriate for some people
•	 Price exclusion, when financial products are unaffordable

The Challenge of Financial Inclusion	
19
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5	
•	 Marketing exclusion, when targeted marketing and sales of financial products 
lead to exclusion
•	 Self-exclusion, which takes place when certain groups of people exclude them-
selves from the formal financial system owing to fear of refusal or other 
psychological barriers
Financial inclusion, therefore, is not merely the outcome of a process, but a 
process in itself. Because of its multidimensional nature, it remains hard to 
interrelate such dimensions over time. As a self-reinforcing cycle that results 
from the accumulation of a number of disadvantages, it is difficult to attribute 
causality to one specific factor or another.
Recognizing the multidimensionality of financial inclusion has led to changes 
in the way it is measured. Similarly, an understanding has emerged that financial 
inclusion is not static, but rather dynamic, and that different individuals or groups 
find themselves in different stages of the financial inclusion process, at times 
temporarily, recurrently, or continuously. Moreover, financial exclusion can occur 
in one or more of the essential markets, that is, transaction banking, savings, 
credit, and insurance. One can therefore argue that no single intervention can 
address all of these complexities and achieve the desired state of inclusiveness. 
Hence, even well-developed financial markets have their own financially 
excluded segments of the population. Developing countries should assess the 
rapidly changing financial and social landscapes and focus on whether vulnerable 
groups face increased risks of financial exclusion.
Although the measurement of financial inclusion using simplistic indicators is 
adequate for assessing the size of the exclusion problem, it may not be sufficient 
to properly inform policy makers in these developing countries; as such, the best 
means of measuring inclusion is still under debate. A literature review reveals 
that different approaches have been proposed, including the use of a variety of 
financial inclusion dimensions, measurable proxies, and a few econometric 
estimations. Because consensus is lacking about a better indicator that can be 
easily measured, all available datasets (Findex 2011 and 2014 Surveys;1 Honohan 
2008; Sophastienphong and Kulathunga 2010) use banking inclusion (both 
demand- and supply-side) as analogous to financial inclusion.
In the second Global Findex Survey (2014), a more rounded understanding of 
financial inclusion is developed to identify opportunities to remove barriers that 
may prevent people from using financial services. Historically, financial inclusion 
was associated with the branch banking model, and therefore almost all measure-
ments of financial inclusion were based on banking density, proximity, availability 
of banking facilities, and affordability of banking products. The 2014 Findex 
Survey revised this narrow view. By adding digital platforms, such as mobile 
money accounts (using mobile phones), to its financial inclusion measures, a 
wider array of indicators (in particular, payment service indicators) are recog-
nized, allowing for more realistic interpretations and comparisons. Thus, for the 
first time, the contribution of digitized payments in furthering financial inclusion 
has been measured globally.

20	
The Challenge of Financial Inclusion
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
It should be noted that this measurement of inclusion is still an evolving pro-
cess. Policy makers must often take a broader view of economic and financial 
development by observing worldwide trends, innovations, and the full range of 
policy initiatives that they might use to design, implement, and monitor progress 
for the promotion of financial inclusion.
Why Does Financial Inclusion Matter?
According to the 2014 Global Findex Survey,2 around 38 percent of adults (ages 
15 and older) living in low- and middle-income economies cannot access basic 
services such as bank accounts, bill payment facilities, mobile money accounts, 
loans, insurance, and other simple financial services because of excessive costs, 
travel distance, documentation needs, and even lack of awareness. The majority 
of this population is at the base of the pyramid and hence is highly vulnerable to 
being unable to cope with unexpected events, such as sickness or death of the 
breadwinner, loss of employment, crop failure, and natural calamities.
Income and expenditure shocks foster disruptive financial practices in an 
effort to smooth consumption, such as borrowing from loan sharks at prohibitive 
rates and selling off assets. As a result, the poor are often unable to climb out of 
the poverty trap. Access to the financial system provides fairer opportunities for 
those living in poverty to improve their income and their standard of living. 
As stated by the Commission on Growth and Development (CGD 2008), if the 
financial system fails to reach large portions of the population, household savings 
will be stunted. People need a secure, accessible vehicle in which to store their 
wealth. If the banks do not provide such vehicles, people will save less or will 
simply store their money in less liquid forms that do not serve well the wider 
economy.
The Link between Financial System Growth and Social Inclusion
In recent literature, economists agree on the positive impacts of financial sector 
development on economic growth. These are well documented in studies by 
Creane et al. (2004) and Merton and Bodie (1995) on the ways in which devel-
opment of the financial system enhances the efficiency of intermediation and 
results in better resource allocation; in Levine’s (2005) seminal paper on the 
merits of financial sector development; and in more recent work by Claessens 
and Feijen (2006) and Ahmad and Malik (2009).
Well-functioning financial systems not only play a critical role in sustaining 
paths of high economic growth by mobilizing savings from the public and 
allocating the funds to productive investments; they also help make growth 
more inclusive by providing access to finance for all, which is associated with 
more rapid growth and job creation, better income distribution, and poverty 
reduction (Kulathunga 2012).
Financial intermediation is a critical factor for growth and social inclusion. 
One of its core functions is to mobilize financial resources from surplus agents 
and channel them to those with deficits. It thus allows investor entrepreneurs to 

The Challenge of Financial Inclusion	
21
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5	
expand economic activity and employment opportunities. It also enables house-
hold consumers, as well as micro- and small-business entrepreneurs, to expand 
their own welfare and earnings opportunities and seek to smooth their lifetime 
outlays. In all cases, financial intermediation drives economic growth and contrib-
utes to social inclusion, provided it is conducted in a sound and efficient way 
(Grais and Kulathunga 2007). Hence, financial intermediation is a key link 
between a country’s overall economic growth and its level of social inclusion.
In underdeveloped financial systems, access is limited. People must resort to 
high-cost informal sources, either because formal financial intermediaries are 
geographically unavailable or because their products are inaccessible because of 
cost and distance. This constrains participation in economic activities, affecting 
growth patterns spatially and across social and economic levels. In contrast, a 
key feature of financial deepening is that it accelerates economic growth by 
expanding access to those who lack adequate finance.
The Link between Financial Inclusion and Poverty Reduction
Access to financial services provides individuals with the opportunity to manage 
risk, broaden their menu of economic choices, and smooth their consumption. 
Increasing financial access provides capital for enterprise expansion, protects 
against both covariate and idiosyncratic shocks, helps move money between fam-
ily members across the world, and generally improves the well-being and eco-
nomic sustainability of the poor.
Theoretically, this promotes economic development, thereby contributing to 
poverty reduction. For example, Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (2007) used 
cross-country data to show that financial development disproportionately raises 
the incomes of the poorest quintile, both by directly reducing income inequality 
and, more powerfully, through impacts on aggregate economic growth.
In their paper introducing the Global Findex Database 2014, Demirgüç-Kunt 
et al. (2015) describe how policy makers and regulators are increasingly making 
financial inclusion a priority in financial sector development. Accordingly, 
67 percent of 147 jurisdictions have a mandate to promote financial inclusion, 
and international organizations—including the G20 and the World Bank—are 
also beginning to formulate strategies that promote financial inclusion.
The Benefits of Financial Inclusion: The Evidence
It is also important to assess the evidence that inclusive and efficient financial 
markets have the potential to improve the lives of citizens, reduce transaction 
costs, spur economic activity, and improve delivery of other social benefits and 
innovative private sector solutions. A 2014 CGAP Focus Note examines the 
evidence and provides a comprehensive evaluation attesting to the positive 
impacts (Cull, Ehrbeck, and Holle 2014):
•	 At the microeconomic level, small businesses benefit from access to credit, 
while the impact on the broader welfare of the borrower’s household might be 
more limited.

•	 Savings help households manage cash flow spikes, smooth consumption, and 
build working capital.
•	 Access to formal savings options can boost household welfare.
•	 Insurance can help poor households mitigate risk and manage shocks.
•	 New types of payment services can reduce transaction costs and seem to 
improve a household’s ability to manage shocks through shared risks.
•	 Financial access improves local economic activity: at the macroeconomic level, 
empirical evidence shows that financial inclusion is positively correlated with 
growth and employment.
•	 Financial inclusion can improve the effectiveness and efficient execution of 
government payment of social safety net transfers (government-to-person, or 
G2P, payments), which play an important role in ensuring the welfare of many 
poor people.
•	 Financial innovation can significantly lower transaction costs and increase 
reach, which is enabling new private sector business models that help address 
other development priorities.
The Global Financial Inclusion Gap
Financial inclusion is a global challenge. Inclusive financial systems—allowing 
broad access to appropriate financial services—are especially likely to benefit 
poor people and other disadvantaged groups (Demirgüç-Kunt and Klapper 2013). 
The Global Findex 2014 data show that 54 percent of the adults from the 
world’s poorest 40 percent of households do not have accounts, not only because 
of poverty, but also because of prohibitive costs, travel distance, and the paper-
work involved.3
Globally, the financial inclusion gap, according to Findex 2014, represents 
around 38 percent of the total adult population. According to Findex 2011 
data—in which financial inclusion had been measured based on the number of 
adults having accounts only in formal financial institutions—the comparable 
global financial access gap was around 50 percent. Thus, adding and measuring 
mobile money transaction accounts in the Findex 2014 Survey helped to 
narrow the inclusion gap between 2011 and 2014 and also portrays a more 
complete picture.
Before the publication of the first Findex Survey data in 2011, Honohan 
(2008) estimated the fraction of the adult population using formal and semi-
formal financial services (that is, from unregulated microfinance institutions) 
for more than 160 countries by combining data from banks and microfinance 
institutions with household surveys. Matching this information with 2005 
population data as a basis, the financially excluded population was estimated 
at around 54 percent of the total adult population in Banking the World: 
Empirical Foundations of Financial Inclusion (Cull, Demirgüç-Kunt, and 
Morduch 2013). Honohan’s estimate (table 1.1) is reasonably consistent with 
Findex data. It reveals that financial service use in low- and middle-income 
countries—which averages around 37 percent—is woefully low compared

with high-income Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) countries, where 92 percent of adults use financial services. The rate 
of exclusion in South Asia is roughly 58 percent, while that of Sub-Saharan 
Africa is highest, with 80 percent of the adult population in the excluded 
category.
South Asia’s Financial Inclusion Gap
The South Asia region is home to many of the developing world’s poor. 
According to the World Bank’s most recent poverty estimates for 2012, about 
309.2 million people in the region survive on less than US$1.90 a day (the rees-
timated extreme poverty line),4 and they make up more than 34.3 percent of the 
developing world’s poor (World Bank 2016).
Thanks to robust economic growth averaging 6 percent per year over the past 
20 years, South Asia has experienced declining poverty and impressive improve-
ments in human development. The percentage of people living on less than 
US$1.25 a day (the extreme poverty line prior to 2015) fell in South Asia from 
61 percent to 24.5 percent between 1981 and 2011 (World Bank 2015a). 
At US$1.90 a day, this was projected to drop further, to 13.5 percent, by 2015 
(World Bank 2016).
However, factors such as weak global demand and lower foreign investment 
pursuant to the global financial crisis, political uncertainties, power outages, and 
weak monsoons resulted in the slowing of economic growth in the region to 
around 4.2 percent in 2012, from an estimated 7.2 percent in 2011. If these vola-
tilities are addressed effectively, it is expected that South Asia can grow by an 
average of around 6.5 percent over the next three years. Nevertheless, the slow-
down in global growth patterns, conflicts, and volatile markets are continuing 
challenges.

In terms of financial access, South Asia ranks above the Middle East and 
Sub-Saharan Africa regions, with around 46 percent of the adult population hav-
ing accounts (figure 1.1).5 Thus the financial inclusion gap—measured in terms 
of the number of adults without an account in a formal financial institution or a 
mobile money account as the proxy—is around 54 percent.6
In recent times, retail payment systems development in Asia as a whole 
has been impressive, although growth rates in South Asia have been low 
relative to those in East Asia (China, Japan, and the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea) and in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, 
and Thailand). It is also noted that technology-driven retail payment ser-
vices have clearly demonstrated their contribution to reducing poverty 
(especially in East Asian and Southeast Asian countries) by ensuring the 
availability and affordability of financial services—in other words, financial 
inclusion.
However, until recently, no meaningful correlation has been established 
between payment services and poverty reduction, although some prelimi-
nary attempts to establish such a relationship are now apparent (as in Cull, 
Demirgüç-Kunt, and Morduch 2013). As such, the potential of retail pay-
ment services as a poverty reduction measure has still not been explored 
fully, primarily because of the narrow range of indicators used to measure 
poverty reduction as well as the labeling of payment services as an informa-
tion and communication technology (ICT) or information technology (IT) 
enabler rather than as a business proposition or a potential measurement of 
the social well-being of the people. Ideally, this perception will change with

the reclassification of the definition of account ownership to include mobile 
money accounts, with the 2014 Findex data as a starting point.
Country-Specific Inclusion Gaps
Analysis of country data shows that almost all South Asian countries fall below 
the regional average (46 percent) for financial inclusion except for Sri Lanka, 
which has 83 percent inclusion.7 At roughly 10 percent and 13 percent, respec-
tively, Afghanistan and Pakistan register the lowest rates in the region (figure 1.2). 
In South Asia overall, 54 percent of adults, or around 585 million people, remain 
outside of the formal financial system.
In the developing world as a whole, it is interesting to note that lack of money 
is the most commonly reported reason for being unbanked. Other reasons for not 
having access to formal financial services include distance to banks and the costs 
associated with maintaining an account at a formal institution such as a bank, 
credit union, savings and credit cooperative, post office, or microfinance institu-
tion (Demirgüç-Kunt and Klapper 2013).
Further analysis of South Asian country data shows a different dimension 
of the inclusion gap: gender-based inequality. Findex data highlight this 
inequality within and across gender: in all South Asian countries except Sri Lanka, 
fewer women than men have financial services accounts (figure 1.3). There is 
striking disparity in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where less than 4 percent of 
women have formal financial access compared with rates nearly four times 
greater for men, at 15.8 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively. Even in India, 
the rate for men (62.5 percent) is 47 percent higher than the rate for women 
(42.6 percent).

The Supply-Side Dimension: Finance Accessibility
Because Findex depicts only demand-side data and does not include Maldives, 
the study also reviews the factors in the supply-side dimension for all South 
Asian countries, using the Getting Finance in South Asia 2010 database 
(Sophastienphong and Kulathunga 2010). Figure 1.4 shows standardized data for 
South Asia for the period 2004–08. Maldives and Sri Lanka both register high 
scores on these indicators of accessibility of finance.
It should be mentioned that, although the penetration numbers for banking 
access are high for Maldives (in terms of geographic and demographic penetra-
tion of automated teller machines [ATMs] or branches), the ratios alone do not 
reflect the true picture, because geographic dispersion of the population among 
the atolls is not taken into consideration in the calculations. Most bank branches 
or ATMs are concentrated on the main island of Malé, while the Maldives popu-
lation of 338,400 is scattered throughout 200 islands in 26 atolls. Most people 
who live on atolls are a two- to four-hour round-trip ferry ride away from the 
nearest bank branch or ATM; thus, to date, although the financial access figure is 
estimated at around 50 percent of the population, cost and proximity issues cre-
ate untold hardships for Maldivians to access financial services.
India scores well on all indicators, while Pakistan’s results suggest a need to 
focus on the use of financial services, notably the provision of loans and the 
mobilization of deposits (Sophastienphong and Kulathunga 2010). Bangladesh 
scores low on demographic penetration for both bank branches and ATMs, while

Bhutan scores low on geographic penetration. Nepal’s scores suggest a need to 
work on all aspects of access to finance, though increasing the number of players 
in the market has not produced the desired effect. Afghanistan scores lowest on 
all indicators.
Poverty, Financial Exclusion, and Financial Vulnerability in South Asia
The overall findings on poverty, the financial inclusion gap, and financial vul-
nerability in South Asia are summarized in figure 1.5. According to Findex 
2014 data, the majority of the adult population in South Asia (54 percent, or 
around 585 million people)8 is financially excluded. According to World Bank 
(2015a) data, the population’s extreme-poverty headcount ratio (below 
US$1.25 per person per day) in 2014 was around 24 percent (399 million 
people). Taken together, these data indicate that, in addition to the extreme 
poor, some 186 million people (around 11 percent of the South Asian adult 
population) are financially vulnerable though not in the extremely poor 
category.

The fact that South Asia accounts for a third of the world’s poor (World 
Bank 2016) indicates the challenge that these financial inclusion indicators 
pose for addressing poverty in the region. However, one needs to be prudent in 
interpreting these statistics or generalizing the results, as they may not have 
fully captured the more recent technology-based financial services that are 
being successfully delivered in some countries in South Asia, especially in 
Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka.
Age dependency on the working-age population is another important 
dimension that cannot be ignored, especially when considering a country’s 
poor.9 At the base of the pyramid, living with less money means having very 
little control over economic outcomes and virtually no ability to save for 
unforeseen events. The ramifications of financial exclusion for working-age 
adults inevitably pass on to their dependents. In South Asia, the age depen-
dency ratios of the young (ages 0–14 years) and old (ages 65 years and older) 
are 46.4 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively.10 Therefore, in South Asia, 
there are nearly 55 dependents per 100 working-age adults, on average. 
Thus, the total financially excluded population in South Asia can be considered 
to exceed 1.5 times the number of working-age adults identified as financially 
excluded.

The extent of concentration of the world’s extremely poor in South Asia 
argues for policy actions and approaches to address the resulting financial inclu-
sion gap. For example, World Bank (2016) data establish that in 2012, Bangladesh 
(at 43.6 percent, or 66 million people) and India (at 21.2 percent, or 268 million 
people) were among the top 10 countries with the largest numbers of extreme 
poor in the world.
At the same time, it is encouraging to see that India led the five top con-
tributors to poverty reduction from 2008 to 2011 by lifting a staggering 
140 million people out of extreme poverty (World Bank 2015a). These num-
bers tell us that, if appropriate policy responses and corrective actions are taken 
to close financial inclusion gaps in South Asia, these significant poverty figures 
can be further reduced by giving poor people more opportunities to participate 
in the economic development process in these countries. The World Bank’s 
expectation is that the extreme poor population in South Asia will be further 
reduced to 249.6 million (35.8 percent of the world’s extreme poor popula-
tion) by 2020, and to a remarkable 42.5 million (10.3 percent of the world’s 
extreme poor) by 2030 (World Bank 2015a). Nevertheless, policy makers and 
researchers have not been able to capture the full contribution to poverty 
reduction of technology-based payment services because of the limited avail-
ability of reliable information.
Remittance Transfers and Financial Inclusion
Introducing the Global Findex 2014 Database, Demirgüç-Kunt et al. (2015) 
highlight the importance of domestic remittances in developing economies. 
According to Findex Surveys, 15 percent of adults in developing economies 
reported having sent money to a relative or friend living in a different part of 
the country, and 19 percent report having received such a payment in 2014. 
While 48 percent of adults questioned in Sub-Saharan Africa reported having 
either sent or received remittances, in South Asia this figure reached only 
around 17 percent.
Although cash remains by far the most common method of sending or receiv-
ing domestic remittances, sending money digitally is gaining popularity, with 
mobile money being the preferred method. Hence remittances are examined 
here as a potential driver of increased use of mobile money, which in turn is an 
entry point for access to additional financial services.
Significance of Remittances to Developing Countries
For many developing economies, remittances are an important source of real 
convertible currency. On a macroeconomic level, remittances are more stable 
than other sources of foreign exchange because their variation is often counter-
cyclical, helping to sustain consumption and investment during downturns. 
The value of remittance flows to developing economies is now more than three 
times that of official development assistance (figure 1.6). For countries such as 
Bangladesh, the increasing flow of remittances has reduced external aid dependency,

while for Sri Lanka remittances offset as much as 85 percent of the country’s 
trade deficit in 2010 (Samuel 2016).
Remittances have become a significant source of external funding in the 
developing world in general, having quadrupled in the past decade, with an 
apparent opportunity to increase flows to South Asia. According to the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM), more than 105 million people 
around the world are migrant workers seeking better opportunities in a foreign 
country.11 Global international remittances in 2012 were estimated at US$514 
billion, a 10.8 percent increase from 2011, including US$401 billion sent to 
developing countries (Klapper and Singer 2014).
For South Asian countries, remittances have been a stable source of 
income, with strong growth potential mostly driven by steady economic 
opportunities in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.12 Nepal is 
among the top recipients of migrant remittances in the world:13 in 2012, the 
share of remittances reached 25 percent of its gross domestic product 
(GDP) and climbed to a staggering 29 percent of GDP by 2013 (table 1.2). 
In 2012, India was the top recipient in the world in terms of value, with 
over US$70 billion in receipts; Pakistan was seventh on the list of top earn-
ers, with remittance receipts totaling US$14 billion (Ratha, Ayana Aga, and 
Silwal 2012).

Impacts of Remittance Methods on Financial Inclusion
Studies on the effects of international remittance transfers on domestic 
financial systems have confirmed that remittances have a positive impact on 
financial inclusion and financial sector development (Aggarwal, Demirgüç-
Kunt, and Martinez Peria 2006; Anzoategui, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Martinez 
Peria 2011; Gupta, Pattillo, and Wagh 2009). However, not much evidence 
pointed to the use of credit markets by the recipients, as the need for credit 
may have been alleviated as a result of money remitted. Indeed, in South Asian 
countries with strong remittance flows, the unbanked percentages neverthe-
less remain high, indicating that poor people still rely principally on cash for 
daily financial transactions. This is confirmed by the large share of funds tied 
up as notes and coins in circulation. In South Asia, the ratio of notes and 
coins is, on average, around 10 percent of GDP—almost twice the rate in 
developed economies—denoting greater use of cash in the settlement pro-
cess (Sophastienphong and Kulathunga 2010).
Because of proximity issues, cost, problems with the means of identifica-
tion, and other factors, senders and receivers of remittances lack safe and 
affordable ways to save, borrow, and send money. This creates an opportunity 
for e-money, to the extent that innovative methodologies can solve these 
problems.
South Asia has the advantage of being the least-cost region to send money 
to, costing an average of 5.7 percent (of the amount sent) over 2008–15 (World 
Bank 2015b).14 Overall, the global average total cost was around 7.7 percent 
and shows a declining trend. The relatively high costs relate in part to limited 
competition, Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting Funding of Terrorism 
(AML/CFT) regulatory restrictions, and the impact of potential penalties on 
transfer operators that further limit entry into the remittance market (Todoroki 
et al. 2014).
On the other hand, transaction cost is not the only factor that matters for 
inclusion. Proximity to a transfer agent matters greatly, since lack of proximity 
implies travel and opportunity costs such as loss of daily wages. Because transfer

agents are largely absent in rural areas, mobile money may offer a solution to 
these problems.
Although the world has recognized remittance flows as a key contributor 
to poverty alleviation, little effort has been devoted to improving payment 
instruments and services through which remittances flow from one country 
to another or from remitter to receiver. Many remitters are frustrated at the 
remitting point (capturing end) because of the nonavailability of direct pay-
ment instruments and the high cost of transactions. Remittance receivers, for 
their part, are equally frustrated at the receiving end (disbursement point) 
because of delays in crediting accounts (transmission delays or bank floats) 
and high commissions or fees.
Recent innovations by the nonbank money transfer service providers (such 
as Western Union and MoneyGram) have helped to speed transfer services, but 
at a cost to remitters and, in some instances, to the remittance receivers as well. 
Banks have made few attempts to speed up remittance flows at affordable 
costs in a satisfactory manner. The remittance corridors that have been estab-
lished have remedied bank-based remittance issues to some extent, although 
further improvements can be made to payment instruments and services.
It is clear that there is a huge opportunity for South Asian countries to 
improve financial inclusion—particularly for the poorer segments of the 
population—by using innovative methods, tools, and applications to harness 
inward remittance flows. Effective e-money solutions should provide benefits to 
customers in terms of proximity, safety, reliability, cost, usability, and diversified 
services that match the needs of the customers, who would, in most cases, 
otherwise be excluded from the formal financial system.

data showed the rate of financial exclusion to be around 67 percent, and the 2014 
Findex exclusion rate is calculated to be around 54 percent (figure 1.1). The difference 
in data collection methodologies may account for the different estimates. Honohan’s 
study is based on household surveys as well as on data from banks and microfinance 
institutions, many of which may not qualify as “formal” by the Findex definition. The 
Findex data are culled from a random sampling survey. Arguably, Honohan’s study 
includes more variables and data points that may explain South Asia’s microfinance 
phenomena and the region’s higher level of inclusion when compared with Findex 
2011 data. The Global Findex 2014 data include not only accounts at formal financial 
institutions but also formal transaction accounts, such as mobile money.

Digitizing Financial Inclusion 
through Innovations
Types of Innovation for Financial Inclusion
South Asia is the birthplace of modern microfinance and today still has some of 
the world’s most sophisticated cash-based financial systems for poor people. It is 
important to explore how these existing methods of financial inclusion can be 
augmented through innovative digital financial services (DFSs) or solutions. 
Technology-based solutions offer tremendous opportunities to transform the 
landscape of access to financial services for the poor, women, and people living 
in remote areas. Doing so can spur development and reduce poverty.
Godinho (2010) states that recent advances made by Brazil, China, or India 
stem to a large extent from building their countries’ national innovation systems. 
However, he also cautions that developing countries will need wise policies as 
innovation becomes a central component of economic development, as is hap-
pening in China, India, and other emerging economies. Appropriate policies will 
ensure that innovative processes are pro-poor, so that distributional outcomes are 
socially inclusive.
Developing a technology and innovation strategy requires having an under-
standing of the different forms of innovation. Henderson and Clark (1990) 
describe two main forms of innovation:
•	 Incremental innovations exploit the potential of established designs, and often 
reinforce the dominance of established firms. They improve the functional 
capabilities of existing technology by means of small-scale improvements in 
the technology’s value by adding attributes such as performance, safety, qual-
ity, and cost. Generational or next-generation technology innovations are 
incremental innovations that lead to the creation of a new but not radically 
different system.
•	 Radical innovations introduce new concepts that depart significantly from past 
practices and help create products or processes based on a different set of engi-
neering or scientific principles and often open up entirely new markets and

potential applications. They provide new functional capabilities unavailable in 
previous versions of the product or service. More specifically related to busi-
ness, radical innovation has been defined by O’Connor and Ayers (2005) as 
“the commercialization of new products and technologies that have a strong 
impact on the market, in terms of offering wholly new benefits, and on the 
firm, in terms of its ability to create new businesses.”
Trends in Financial Service Innovation
Banks typically opt for an incremental launch of innovative products, services, or 
tools in retail banking. The deregulation and liberalization of the financial sector 
in the 1970s witnessed the advent of numerous innovations in the form of pay-
ment (credit and debit cards); transaction processing (automated teller machines 
[ATMs], telephone and online banking, and e-commerce for financial assets); 
saving options (such as investment funds and structured products); loans (auto-
mated credit scoring); and risk management techniques (derivatives and securi-
tization). Breakthroughs in information technologies are largely responsible for 
these new developments that boost productivity, permit a better diversification 
of risk, and generate economies of scale in internal activities, to mention a few 
of the benefits (Vives 2010).
Although these innovations brought greater financial inclusion, they also 
increased a domino-effect contagion, largely due to excessive risk taking, deregu-
lation, and regulatory arbitrage, as evidenced in the global financial crisis of 
2007–08. In the wake of the financial fallout and economic downturn, banks 
have been actively pursuing strategies centered on digital technologies and solu-
tions to provide a holistic service to their clients in an effort to regain their trust, 
boost flagging customer loyalty, and increase their market share by offering an 
integrated and seamless customer experience. In both developed and emerging 
markets, consumers increasingly prefer multichannel banking, with full digital 
access and more personalized products and services. Interestingly, in these mar-
kets, retail banks face serious competition from online-payment specialists and 
digital merchants such as Square, PayPal, Simple, Google Wallet, Venmo, Amazon, 
eBay, and the like.
While innovations tend to diffuse across all markets, those same innovations 
may not generate market development or financial inclusion in developing coun-
tries that are at different stages of development and where large segments of 
society are financially excluded. Moreover, innovations do not always flow in one 
direction—from more-developed to less-developed markets.
The case studies in this volume highlight innovations in less-developed mar-
kets that have not yet been introduced into more-mature markets. The status quo 
in banking and finance will have to change to accommodate around 2.2 billion 
poor people in the world (around one-third of the world’s population, who are 
surviving on less than US$2 a day).1
What is needed are radical innovations in the way financial services are pro-
vided that engender transformational outcomes. Such innovations can create 
true competitive advantage as well as build new market segments and business

opportunities by scaling up. Radical innovations are revolutionary in nature and 
involve significantly more risk taking, which is why it is rare to see established 
banking institutions initiating such practices. Breakthrough innovations in 
financial services could enable large portions of the population to access and 
use the financial system, thus providing opportunities to work toward better 
living standards.
Impacts of Recent Innovations on Financial Inclusion
The significance and trends of innovation in retail payment systems and products, 
along with the impact on financial inclusion from a payment systems perspective, 
were documented in the 2010 survey conducted in 139 countries by the World 
Bank’s Payment Systems Development Group. The Global Payment Systems 
Survey observed that there had been a fairly widespread adoption of electronic 
payment channels for the initiation of payment transactions using innovative 
retail payment mechanisms (World Bank 2012). In terms of usage, innovative 
payment products are still used much less frequently than traditional retail pay-
ment products. However, they are important for financial inclusion in over 
14 percent of the surveyed countries. Although nonbanking entities are playing 
a significant role in the provision of innovative retail payment products and 
mechanisms, banks remain a significant player in this field.
Collaboration among various types of entities is widespread, with over one-
third of the products involving joint provision of a product or service, almost all 
of which involved a bank and a telecom company (World Bank 2012). In 60 
percent of the cases, customer funds were protected fully. Furthermore, innova-
tive payment products appear to have fairly well-developed pricing models. 
Merchant payments, utility bill payments, and person-to-person (P2P) transfers 
were the most common transaction types supported by the innovative payment 
mechanisms; less than 10 percent of the products supported government-to-
persons (G2P) payments.
Most of the innovative products or mechanisms have limited interoperability, 
with less than 20 percent of the products reported to be fully or partially interop-
erable (World Bank 2012). Also, traditional clearing and settlement infrastructure 
is not generally used, and more than 50 percent of the innovative products 
reported in the survey were settled in the books of the issuer, with only around 
24 percent settling in central bank money. Security and fraud risks seem to be 
getting inadequate attention. Central banks identified themselves as the over-
seers of around 60 percent of the products; however, 10 percent of the products 
were subject to collaborative oversight.
In contrast to the detailed transaction data available for traditional retail pay-
ment systems and products, the details available for innovative payment prod-
ucts and payment systems are limited. In general, central banks are not overly 
optimistic about the anticipated impact of innovations on retail payment sys-
tems and financial inclusion in their respective jurisdictions. Of the 132 partici-
pating central banks, 31 anticipated that the use of electronic payment 
instruments would increase, 16 foresaw a positive impact on financial inclusion, 

40

and 8 expected a positive impact on efficiency (World Bank 2012). Seven 
­central banks anticipated no significant impact on inclusion from ongoing 
innovations.
E-money and Digital Payments
Though the digital economy is still in its infancy, it is fast taking shape in response 
to technological advancements and innovations, even in developing countries. 
Not too long ago, payment systems only dealt with the transfer of money. While 
electronic payment systems date back to the 1970s, when Western Union intro-
duced the electronic funds transfer (EFT), recent transformative innovations 
such as mobile applications, e-wallets, near-field communication, and card pay-
ments have broadened the array of available electronic payment modalities.
Across the globe, digital payments and e-money products are expanding 
rapidly, mostly because of their potential to make small-value payments 
cheaper and safer for both payer and payee. In their article titled “The Future 
of Global Payments,” Bruno, Istace, and Niederkorn (2014) state that the 
emergence of digital technology is leading to faster and more convenient 
payments solutions, and a subsequent rise in the expectations of both 
retail-consumer and commercial clients, thereby expanding financial inclu-
sion. They forecast that payments revenue will grow by 8 percent each year 
through 2018, at which point annual revenue will reach US$2.3 trillion and 
account for 43 percent of all banking services revenue, compared with 34 
percent in 2009. Although e-money provides a viable means of enhancing 
financial inclusion, it is not a panacea. Nevertheless, e-money and digital pay-
ment systems help address ­barriers to inclusion and ensure connectivity to 
mainstream financial services.
What Is E-money?
The World Bank (2012) defines electronic money (e-money) instruments as 
access mechanisms to prefunded accounts held at banks or nonbank institu-
tions that can be used through the Internet, payment cards, or mobile phones. 
Such instruments have the potential to further reduce the dependence on 
paper-based payment instruments by dramatically broadening access to elec-
tronic payments for a larger number of consumers, especially unbanked and 
underbanked consumers.
According to the definition in the “Electronic Money Directive” issued by the 
European Union, “electronic money” is monetary value as represented by a claim 
on the issuer that is (a) stored electronically (including magnetically); (b) issued 
on receipt of funds of an amount not less in value than the monetary value 
issued; and (c) accepted as a means of payment by undertakings other than those 
of the issuer (ECB 2009).
It is not necessary for e-money to be associated with a bank in making the 
payment transaction, because e-money acts as a prepaid bearer instrument.

Virtual currency schemes such as Bitcoin are a form of e-money; however, unlike 
virtual currency, the link between e-money and the fiat currency against which 
the e-money is issued remains intact, because funds are expressed in units of that 
currency such as U.S. dollars or euros (table 2.1).
It should also be noted that there is an ongoing debate on whether e-money 
can be considered “money.” The principal objections raised, as discussed by Geva 
and Kianieff (2005), are the following: First, e-money does not provide a distinct 
unit of account. Second, payment with e-money may not be anonymous, because 
the third-party obligor may keep a record of each transfer. Third, e-money may 
be created other than by withdrawal from a reservable deposit with a commer-
cial bank, so as to undermine the central bank’s hold on monetary policy. Fourth, 
e-money cannot constitute legal tender. However, these conditions can be 
addressed (though not entirely eliminated) if e-money is universally accepted 
and if the economy becomes truly digital.
The impact of developing e-money on a country’s monetary policy is a funda-
mental concern. Essentially, monetary policy is aimed at preserving price stabil-
ity; to do that, the monetary authority manages the money supply through 
various policy tools. If e-money is created by converting cash or deposit accounts, 
there won’t be new money creation, hence no additional impact on monetary 
policy. Consequently, digital financial applications typically ensure that the total 
value of e-money is mirrored in a bank account in the banking system. Although 
the bank account can earn interest on the balance, e-money in the digital pay-
ment system cannot.

Digital Payment Systems
The World Bank (2012) analysis of the evolution of retail payments over the past 
five to six decades shows that
•	 Successful adoption of advances in technology have played a key role in the 
development of new channels for payment initiation, improved authentica-
tion, and efficient processing;
•	 The development of new payment needs (transit payments, Internet auction 
sites, and social networking sites) have also led to the creation of new payment 
mechanisms; and
•	 Payment infrastructure created for one payment product has been successfully 
leveraged for other payment products, such as using an automated clearinghouse 
(ACH) for online banking–enabled payments or the successful leveraging of 
infrastructure created for credit cards by debit cards.
Payment systems enable people and businesses to pay bills, buy goods and 
services, remit money, and collect dues. Moreover, they help governments and 
regulators to pay salaries, pensions, and other remunerations, disburse social 
grants and other benefits; and collect taxes, fees, and dues from the general 
public. Transformative innovations in the payment systems offer alternative 
digital channels, such as real-time payments using mobile phones and smart-
phones, cards, and Internet, thereby enabling faster, more secure, and more effi-
cient services at lower cost. While some of these options may not work for the 
financially excluded, others, such as ubiquitous access to mobile phones, can 
enable efficient and low-cost payment alternatives to traditional methods.
Tarazi (2011) highlighted the cost implications of branch versus branchless 
banking, demonstrating that significant savings can be achieved in moving toward 
branchless banking, which would positively affect the value propositions 
involved in offering services to poor people (figure 2.1). Often, digitizing pay-
ments is the first step toward becoming a cash-lite society. Many countries may 
not go beyond this point, but even so, the impact of this measure alone on finan-
cial inclusion would be significant.
Toward a Cash-Lite Society
Although financial inclusion is increasingly becoming a national strategy in many 
countries, embracing digital payments and moving toward a cash-lite society 
rarely is seen as a national development priority. Lack of visible and tangible 
results in the short run may be the reason. However, growing evidence on the 
benefits offered by electronic payments over cash in terms of safety, convenience, 
least cost, fighting crime and corruption, and advancing financial inclusion sug-
gests that a strategically driven and coordinated approach managed by regulators 
and policy makers, along with bank and nonbank operators, is needed to unlock 
the potential of DFS technology in developing countries (box 2.1).

Box 2.1  Cash versus Electronic Payments
Today, around 85 percent of all retail payment transactions are done with cash, which equates 
to 60 percent of retail transaction value. Although much of the world’s population has access 
to many options for making payments other than cash, it continues to persist as a major 
means of exchange. Cash takes time to get at, is riskier to carry, and by most estimates, costs 
society as much as 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
Electronic payments, on the other hand, have been proven to boost economic growth, 
while advancing financial inclusion. It is for these reasons that countries around the world are 
working to make their payment systems less dependent on cash.

Even today, many central banks and policy makers in the bankcentric develop-
ing countries consider payments as part of information and communication 
technology (ICT) and information technology (IT) and continue to ignore the 
potential of mobile-based payment systems. This is primarily because of igno-
rance and also a vested interest in traditional financial service providers—that is, 
banks and approved financial institutions.
On the contrary, many advanced-country central banks have appointed 
national payment councils (NPCs) to educate all stakeholders involved in pay-
ment system development for both large-value and retail payments. Although a 
tremendous amount of progress has been achieved in advanced markets such as 
Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, little or no achievement is recorded 
in developing- and emerging-country NPCs.
Some central banks have become “onlookers” as market practitioners, and 
financial market infrastructure (FMI) providers have overtaken them by 
­keeping up with emerging trends in technology. In this context, it is imperative 
to enhance the capacities and knowledge of senior policy makers and regulators 
as to the wide-ranging benefits of payment system development when it comes 
to achieving broader social and economic advantages—including those related 
to effective monetary management, the establishment of financial system 
­stability, poverty reduction, and the promotion of financial inclusion and access 
to finance.
In most developing countries, adopting these systems can be a revolutionary 
experience by providing access to a previously unbanked population. Digitizing 
payments can lead to tangible efficiencies in the form of huge cost savings and 
increased efficiency for payers, as in the following examples:
•	 In Mexico, by digitizing and centralizing its payments, the Mexican govern-
ment is saving an estimated US$1.27 billion per year—or 3.3 percent of its 
total expenditure—on wages, pensions, and social transfers. In 2012, 
97 percent of pension payments were made by electronic transfers (Babatz 
2013).
•	 In Kenya, mobile payments made through M-Pesa played a central role in 
improving financial inclusion—increasing the share of adults having access to 
financial services from 18.9 percent in 2006 to 66.7 percent in 2013 (FSD 
Kenya and CBK 2013) and clearing K Sh 192.6 billion (US$2.09 billion) 
worth of mobile transactions in March 2014.
•	 In Brazil, when the government disbursed Bolsa Família grants through 
electronic benefit cards, administrative costs were reduced from 14.7 per-
cent to 2.6 percent of the total grant value (Pickens, Porteous, and Rotman 
2009).
Transitioning toward a cash-lite society starts with digitizing the payments 
channel. Bankable Frontier Associates (BFA 2012) identifies four stages on the 
path from a “cash-heavy” society at one end (in which cash is by far the

predominant payment instrument) toward a “cash-lite” society at the other (in 
which cash is no longer the most common means of payment), as follows 
(figure 2.2):
1.	 In a cash-heavy society, paper-based instruments (such as cash or perhaps 
checks) are the main ones in use.
2.	 The first shift happens when bulk payers in an economy—such as government, 
large employers, or development aid distributors—decide to pay electronically.
3.	 The second shift takes place as opportunities grow for recipients to spend or 
transfer money electronically.
4.	 Finally, a cash-lite society has been achieved when even the majority of small 
payments—usually transactions between people and merchants (person-to-
business [P2B]) for everyday items like groceries—also become electronic.

The BFA (2012) study recognizes that these shifts may not always be 
linear; however, each shift can bring significant benefits in terms of cost, reli-
ability, safety, proximity, and even access to new markets and opportunities 
for users.
The earlier examples from Brazil, Kenya, and Mexico provide evidence to 
amply demonstrate that the use of innovative e-money and digital payment solu-
tions has brought previously excluded people into the formal financial system. 
These developments are encouraging for cash-based South Asian countries, 
where only 46 percent of adults are financially included.2 Moving away from 
cash, therefore, would continue to open access to the formal financial system for 
many of South Asia’s unbanked.
Risks in Digital Finance
As the detailed explanation in Part II of this volume (chapters 4–6) suggests, 
technology alone does not bring truly transformational outcomes, and technology 
is certainly not a “silver bullet.” It is the human element—vision, long-term com-
mitment, cooperation between public and private stakeholders, and trust—at 
each stakeholder level that provides the leadership necessary to confront and 
overcome barriers to achieving greater levels of financial inclusion for the poor 
in a sustainable manner. Although the technology, model, transmission channels, 
and products may be new in DFSs, traditional risk management methods of 
identifying risks and of quantifying and assessing the likelihood of occurrence 
remain true for DFSs as well. The following risks (as discussed in more detail in 
the subsections that follow) can derail the successful scaling-up and use of 
e-money at all stakeholder levels:
•	 Political economy risks stem from vested interests that resist the introduc-
tion of disruptive technologies, as well as legal and regulatory risks arising 
from lack of governance codes, payments laws, Anti-Money Laundering and 
Combatting Funding of Terrorism (AML/CFT) laws, other laws and 
regulations.
•	 Cybersecurity risks may result from the failure to enable institutions with the 
capacity to ensure the efficient functioning of systems and protect against 
cyberthreats.
•	 Risks to the payments system may compromise system functions if the service 
providers do not adequately understand the digital customer base or the infra-
structure requirements.
•	 Principal-agent risks must be addressed to minimize revenue losses, fines and 
other reprimands by the regulators, fraudulent activities and corruption, and 
loss of reputation.
•	 Risks to customers result not only from inadequate information and under-
standing of e-money but also from lack of consumer protection and ade-
quate redress mechanisms, identity theft, and liquidity-related issues, among 
others.

Political Economy Risks
Digital finance is a “disruptive technology,” especially when it is operated by 
nonbanks such as technology companies or mobile network operators (MNOs). 
Existing regulated financial institutions represent vested interests that may 
oppose the introduction of nonbank competitors, whose lower-cost business 
model is seen as unfair competition and a threat to existing bank-based opera-
tions and potential profits.3
Although the economics of e-money at the macro level are driven by supply 
and demand and the fixed cost of providing infrastructure, political economy 
considerations shape the issue of regulating e-payments. Given the influence of 
special interests and their collective powers, often the strength and leadership of 
the regulator alone determines the success or failure of perfectly legitimate 
e-money initiatives. This aspect is highlighted in the case studies.
The regulator’s role in setting and achieving financial inclusion objectives 
includes leveling the playing field by introducing regulations that enable entry 
and competition by these “disruptors” while putting in place flexible and effec-
tive risk management frameworks to protect consumer funds. This may require 
adjusting know-your-customer (KYC) and registration requirements that limit 
uptake and use. The outcome substantially affects the business risk to the digi-
tal financial operator because the large, long-term nature of the investment in 
infrastructure and customer touchpoints requires widespread customer use for 
the venture to be cost-effective and eventually profitable. In some cases, the 
unwillingness of the regulator to challenge vested interests—by facilitating 
nonbank competitors’ entry—partly explains the slow pace of growth of suc-
cessful e-money deployments.
Cybersecurity Risks
In promoting financial inclusion through digital payment instruments and chan-
nels, policy makers and regulators should also pay attention to external disruptive 
elements such as cybercrimes that can compromise databases and the function-
ing of technology-based products and services. Although policy makers have 
urged market participants to work together to combat cybercrimes, service pro-
viders in most emerging and developing markets have not taken such calls seri-
ously enough. Nor have they consented to coordinate or cooperate with peers in 
reducing costs involved in establishing preventive measures, including legal and 
regulatory measures.
In general, high-value payment systems, such as real-time gross settlement 
systems, are closely monitored, and service providers observe best practice and 
work within rigorous regulatory frameworks. As such, high-value payment 
systems are relatively safer than retail payment services, which consist of an 
array of payment instruments and channels, mostly digital. Retail service pro-
viders include nonbank institutions, whose commitment to prudent payment 
services can be questionable, given the scale and use of ad hoc infrastructure 
platforms. Whereas potential damage to a high-value payment system can be 
far more severe, given the high volume and value as well as the criticality of 

48	
Digitizing Financial Inclusion through Innovations
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
such transactions, retail payment services also require prudence and effective-
ness in surveillance and monitoring.
The Bank for International Settlements Committee on Payments and 
Market Infrastructures (BIS/CPMI) 24 guidelines4 are important to ensure 
that digital services and devices are safe and do not exclude the poor, as these 
guidelines have been prepared to capture operations of all financial market 
infrastructure providers and participants. In the local context, the applicability 
of some of the existing legal and regulatory frameworks may not be adequate 
to cover digital payment services. Hence, policy makers and regulators may 
need technical advice and support from international organizations in dealing 
with external disruptions such as cybercrime.
Although relatively small in value, a cyberthreat against retail and micro-
level digital finance service providers can have serious consequences for the 
poor and vulnerable. The micro-level service providers can be wiped out, while 
the clientele can lose their lifetime savings and wealth (if any), even under a 
mild form of cyberattack. Unfortunately, because of heavy competition as well 
as their small scale and lower profitability, many service providers in developing 
countries do not appear sufficiently concerned about the potential impacts of 
cyberattacks to observe international best practice cyber protocols and security 
guidelines intended to cushion the impact of cyberthreats. In this regard, efforts 
are needed by both international and national bodies that deal with cyber-
threats to coordinate and promote the observance of international protocols 
and best practice by DFS providers.
Risks to the Payments System
The essence of a payments system is to offer transactional services with the 
minimum amount of risk. Digital payments as narrowly discussed in this 
study do not introduce new types of risks to the payment system, and digital 
payment systems are generally not considered to be systemically important 
(with the exception of Kenya’s M-Pesa and the South African Social Security 
Agency [SASSA] social grants system). It is important to note that large-
value payments are typically managed by central banks, which have the abil-
ity to address impending risks online on a real-time basis. Other retail 
payment systems typically handle transactions between prudentially regu-
lated financial institutions that have their own risk management frameworks, 
already vetted by the central banks.
In contrast, new digital technologies often result in large numbers of low-
value transactions, scattered across a country and bringing in a vast number of 
players (both payment system providers and their agent networks) with little 
if any prudential training, risk management abilities, or understanding of the 
types of risks and requirements of handling financial transactions. It is for this 
reason that most regulators are often hesitant to bring nonbank operators into 
the payment arena. In this regard, there may be a case for establishing an NPC 
to play a role in ensuring that such payments risks are minimized. Nevertheless, 
the NPCs often are seen to pay scant attention to the retail payment systems 

Digitizing Financial Inclusion through Innovations	
49

and focus mostly on the large-value systems. The case studies reflect the impor-
tance of developing e-money, as defined in this report, as an integral part of a 
country’s national payments framework that is covered by the payments law 
and enabling provisions.
Principal-Agent Risks
The principal-agent risk or problem arises because the MNO or DFS provider 
must depend upon a network of agents to provide on-the-ground services 
directly to the customer. Because of the large geographical distribution of 
agents, network management often is employed to monitor and manage agent 
performance and ensure that agent incentives are aligned with those of the 
principal, the DFS provider. Agents and agent networks introduce new opera-
tional, financial crime, and consumer risks, many of which are due to the physi-
cal distance between agents and the provider or the agent network manager and 
the resulting challenges to effective training and oversight. Operational risks 
include fraud, agent error, poor cash management by the agent, and poor data 
handling. In addition to the financial crime risks of fraud and theft (including 
data theft), agents may fail to comply with AML/CFT rules regarding customer 
due diligence, handling records, and reporting suspicious transactions. Agents 
may also take actions that reduce transparency (for example, on pricing, terms, 
and recourse), engage in abusive treatment of customers (including overcharging), 
or fail to handle customer data confidentially (McKee, Kaffenberger, and 
Zimmerman 2015).
Risks to the Customer
At the consumer level, evidence from research conducted in 16 countries by 
McKee, Kaffenberger, and Zimmerman (2015) reveals information on customers’ 
perceptions and experiences with risks and the ways in which these risks harm 
their trust, uptake, and use of the services. Although customers highly value and 
benefit from many basic DFSs, many users are not only new to both formal 
finance and technology but also live precarious financial lives that allow little 
room for error.
Also revealed is strong evidence that providers are actually not realizing the 
full potential of growing numbers of DFS deployments. In many cases this is 
because customers experience challenges or problems that erode their trust and 
therefore limit their use of DFSs—often to over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, 
which do not require an account. When nonusers (potential customers) observe 
friends and family struggling with digital platforms, they frequently conclude 
that the services are simply too risky. The report identified seven key risk areas 
for customers of DFSs (box 2.2).
Such risks can translate into loss of savings, indebtedness, loss of identification, 
and loss of faith in the financial system, leading to reexclusion from the financial 
system. Practical steps undertaken to protect customers from the risks of digital 
finance and to facilitate consumer trust, uptake, and use of e-money are addressed 
in the case studies at different stakeholder levels.

Box 2.2  Doing Digital Finance Right: The Case for Stronger 
Customer Risk Mitigation
Research in 16 countries concerning customers’ perceptions of and experiences with digital 
financial services (DFSs) revealed seven perceived risk areas:
•	 Inability to transact due to network or service downtime. This most commonly cited risk area 
can lead to risky customer behaviors such as leaving cash with an agent to conduct a trans-
action later when the network is back up. It also presents challenges if customers need 
money urgently and cannot cash out until the network resumes.
•	 Insufficient agent liquidity. This is the second most common risk-related area that com-
monly prevents customers from transacting and accessing their money. This problem 
­particularly plagues bulk payment recipients (such as G2P [government-to-persons] 
recipients): because many receive their transfers all on the same day and want to cash out 
immediately, agents struggle to meet liquidity demands. The recipients are often among 
the poorest in a country, and the extra fees and the delay in receiving their benefits can 
seriously affect their ability to meet basic needs.
•	 Complex and confusing user interfaces. This customer risk is exemplified by the difficult-to-
resolve experience of a user who sends money to a wrong number, which often also 
results in financial loss. Difficulties with the menu also cause many customers to seek 
assistance conducting transactions, requiring them to share private information (such as 
their personal identification number [PIN]) with an agent, family member or friend—
exposing them to potential fraud by the person providing help.
•	 Inadequate provider recourse. Complaints and dispute resolution options are unclear, caus-
ing the customer to lose time, money, and mobile-phone airtime to either travel to cus-
tomer care centers or wait on hold for call center staff who may or may not be able to solve 
the problem.
•	 Nontransparency of fees and other terms. This issue prevents customers from fully under-
standing the details of services and leaves them vulnerable to agent misconduct and 
price fraud.
•	 Fraud perpetrated on customers. Customers can experience fraud at the hands of provider 
employees or external fraudsters who use “social engineering” scams such as phony pro-
motions to obtain money or information from unsuspecting customers.a Agents can also 
perpetuate fraud by charging unauthorized fees.
•	 Inadequate privacy and protection of customers’ personal data. Disclosure of data-handling 
practices is often weak, with details available only on a website to which few consumers 
have access and in “legalese” that is difficult to understand.

a. “Social engineering scams” refers to scams whereby a hacker tricks the target themselves, or perhaps an unwitting 
customer service agent, into revealing information that gives the hacker access to victims’ passwords or accounts.

Stakeholders in Digital Financial 
Inclusion
Introduction
In examining how financial inclusion can be advanced through the use of digital 
channels, four levels of stakeholders that are essential to financial inclusion 
pathways can be identified:
•	 Macro: policy makers, regulators, and donors
•	 Meso: organizations that support financial services providers
•	 Micro: digital financial services (DFSs) providers
•	 Customer
Digital innovations that can influence financial inclusion through these 
pathways include e-money, mobile-phone access to e-wallets or bank accounts, 
card systems, near-field communication (NFC)–enabled systems, agent and cor-
respondent financial services, remittances, and government-to-persons (G2P) 
and person-to-government (P2G) payments through partially or fully elec-
tronic means. To determine which innovations in the digital space can enhance 
financial inclusion, it is important to identify the ways in which customers—as 
well as micro-, meso-, and macro-level actors—can be influenced and leveraged 
to achieve greater financial inclusion using innovative digital means and path-
ways. To that end, each level has a role to play in promoting digital financial 
inclusion:
•	 Policy makers must provide leadership and vision in setting the policy agenda, 
and regulators should develop an enabling, nonprohibitive regulatory environ-
ment that may be iteratively layered as the market matures.
•	 Enabling institutions should develop a rich ecosystem and infrastructure in 
which digital finance can grow.

54	
Stakeholders in Digital Financial Inclusion
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
•	 DFS providers should develop and operate various digital solutions and options 
that create, preserve, and enhance positive value propositions for the custom-
ers who are predominantly from the base of the pyramid.
•	 Customer preferences should be identified, and customers must be given the 
opportunity to acquire financial education to better understand how they can 
benefit from financial inclusion and use digital financial services to manage 
their needs as well as access other economic opportunities in a much more 
cost-effective manner.
Macro-Level Stakeholders: Policy Makers, Regulators, and Donors
Macro-level stakeholders can be defined as national policy makers, donors, 
funders, national regulatory and supervisory bodies, and even international 
knowledge exchange and advocacy bodies. The goals of most of those listed 
are either to perform or direct micro- or meso-level interventions, or to influ-
ence national governmental players. From the donors’ perspective, macro-level 
interventions are the second-most funded interventions after micro-level. 
Indeed, many multilateral donors have separate departments to support 
public (macro) and private (micro and meso) sector development.
Governments as policy makers are the key players in driving the national 
digital financial agenda, and they oversee coordinated policy actions. In some 
developing countries today, it is heartening to see government agencies them-
selves developing policies, drafting legislation, sharing knowledge among them-
selves (in organic South-South knowledge exchanges), and achieving such levels 
of innovation that donors can be seen trying to keep up. In such instances, gov-
ernments are seen to be managing the transition to DFSs not only by mandating 
but also by consciously supporting the transition.
Regulators are macro-level stakeholders whose responses to financial innova-
tion need careful attention. From the point of view of financial systemwide sta-
bility, the apprehensions of central banks and regulators should be appreciated 
but should not inhibit the much-needed promotion of financial inclusion. It is 
important for central banks and regulators to permit and even facilitate techno-
logical innovations insofar as they promote financial inclusion and poverty reduc-
tion, while ensuring that they do not outstrip or circumvent prudential 
regulations to maintain the safety of the financial system and customers’ funds. 
An enabling regulator should focus on policies and strategies that target financial 
inclusion and broaden financial access through the entry of new players, while 
regulating risks associated with lower-cost intermediaries entering the financial 
space.
However, in a highly dynamic, innovative digital space, imperfect knowledge 
about digital products and systems leaves regulators permanently in catch-up 
mode. As digital systems evolve and new players enter the payment space, new 
kinds of risks emerge, especially outside the banking system. Concerns about 
Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting Funding of Terrorism (AML/CFT) 
and consumer protection issues have to be addressed quickly and efficiently. 

Stakeholders in Digital Financial Inclusion

Hence, regulators have to be proactive while avoiding regulatory overkill that 
might stifle financial innovations that can expand financial inclusion of the 
unbanked and underbanked masses.
Hence, central banks and regulators should step up their supervision and over-
sight capabilities rather than refuse approvals or use delaying tactics to prevent 
nonbanks—mobile network operators (MNOs), in particular—from entering 
into payment spaces. Furthermore, they should offer technology-based payment 
solutions to deal with basic payment transactions (such as cash-in/cash-out in 
domestic remittances), bill-pay facilities, and similar transaction services as an 
important stepping-stone toward entering the formal financial system.
Meso-Level Stakeholders: Enabling Institutions
Meso-level stakeholders do not provide direct financial services but strengthen 
and support mainly micro-level players. They typically provide information, 
support services, and infrastructure and include the following:
•	 Technical services providers for consumer and financial institution training, 
consulting, and product support, potentially for each product type
•	 Industry research organizations such as research institutes and universities, 
consulting firms, and rating agencies
•	 Policy advocates, industry associations, and networks (local, regional, and 
international)
•	 Technology service and payment service providers for hardware, software, and 
information technology (IT) technical support for payments systems; 
automated teller machines (ATMs); core banking software; and mobile 
banking
•	 MNOs that provide services on behalf of micro-level players
•	 Agents, such as agent networks of MNOs, because although they are the 
customer touchpoints for mobile money, they act on behalf of MNOs in a sup-
porting role
Not all of these players participate in developing digital finance systems in 
each country. Their involvements will vary with the level of development of the 
systems, donor activities, regulatory and policy structures, and so on. They sup-
port private sector operators in setting up and managing new systems, as well as 
strengthen the existing micro-level actors to be more financially sustainable and 
sophisticated (and thereby offer better service to their clients). They also influ-
ence the micro-level players to extend their client base and provide knowledge, 
training, and information on national and international best practice. Meso-level 
stakeholder support and participation in the development process will also 
reduce market distortions and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
micro-level stakeholders. In addition, they are well positioned to provide finan-
cial education services to the consumers and can play an advisory role to the 
macro-level stakeholders as well.

Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
The 2012 Bank for International Settlements Committee on Payments and 
Market Infrastructures (BIS/CPMI) 24 guidelines for financial management 
information systems (FMISs) recognize the critical importance of all service pro-
viders in payment system development and the need for compliance with such 
guidelines for safety, efficiency, reliability, and affordability of payment services 
(BIS and IOSCO 2012). In a way, these guidelines bring market discipline—a 
lacuna in the payment landscape for some time—to all payment system 
providers.
Although meso-level service providers and stakeholders are also expected to 
observe standards and market ethics, the regulators are expected to monitor 
observance through effective surveillance systems. Some countries in Asia 
(Malaysia and Singapore) have already complied with many of the CPMI 
guidelines—as seen from the endorsements received from the International 
Monetary Fund’s and World Bank’s Financial Sector Assessment Program evalu-
ation teams—while other countries seem to lag behind. It is important that 
national payment councils in other countries take the initiative to educate 
meso-level service providers on the importance of observing these best practices 
to develop healthy payment systems (for retail payments, in particular) that offer 
numerous benefits in promoting financial inclusion and access to finance.
Micro-Level Stakeholders: Institutions Offering Digital Solutions
Micro-level stakeholders are entities that provide DFSs to customers. They include 
banks and other licensed financial institutions; nonbank financial institutions that 
are authorized to operate mobile money solutions (typically MNOs); authorized 
e-money issuers; and other payment service providers.
It is important to have a national agenda on digital financial inclusion so that 
micro-level service providers are able to play various roles: fill gaps in the market; 
provide services to underserved areas via relaxed regulatory hurdles, moral 
suasion, quotas, or subsidies; offer additional product offerings through strategic 
partnerships and product developments; and strengthen their institutional 
capacity to increase institutional sustainability and sophistication. The goal is 
broader outreach, better-quality products, improved customer interactions, and 
sharing of national and international best practices to facilitate institutional 
self-improvement.
Often, digital financial inclusion strategies stall because some of these 
micro-institution types that have touchpoints with financially excluded people 
are overlooked. E-wallets and mobile-phone access are two frequently neglected 
channels. Micro-level service providers should be persuaded to use less cash 
and paper-based instruments, and medium-term targets should be set for the 
purpose.

Customer-Level Stakeholders: Users
Customers are the people and institutions that use the DFS and payment 
services. Sometimes, when financial products or solutions fail, it is because they 
are supply-driven—designed to deliver industry perceptions of what customers 
need rather than serving an unmet need expressed by actual customers. Focusing 
on customer convenience and efficiency will guarantee a successful digital finan-
cial deployment. It is, therefore, important for stakeholders to understand their 
customers’ true perceptions, needs, and beliefs.
Although the pathways to financial inclusion start with the first customer 
touchpoint, which is usually based on a specific need, there is no guarantee that 
just because a customer had previously used a particular financial service, he 
or she will then go on to learn about or obtain access to others. Use and trust in 
the reliability, convenience, and safety of the service needs to be promoted to 
maximize its chances of success. It is important to engage community-level out-
reach, especially in rural communities, and to provide financial education 
programs. It is also important to understand that, in many countries, first-time 
users commonly prefer to use over-the-counter transactions.
Service providers must understand the needs of these populations, build-
ing trust and facilitating their familiarity with digital solutions in order to 
convert them into account holders. Although customers may gradually give 
up their predilection for cash- and paper-based payment instruments, effec-
tive incentives—including price incentives—may be provided to accelerate 
progress toward the goal of paperless payments in the interest of financial 
inclusion.

Critical Enablers That Are 
Game Changers in 
Successful E-money 
Deployments
Transitioning to digital payments will require well-supported evidence that doing so is 
in the interest of all participants—businesses, governments, financial institutions, 
merchants and consumers. Investment will be required to update systems to replace 
paper payments and facilitate electronic processing of invoices. None of this will 
happen without first presenting a tangible case for future success.
—Canadian Task Force for the Payments System Review, 
“Going Digital: Transitioning to Digital Payments”
The main reasons why people lack access to formal financial systems seem 
to be similar across the globe. Those reasons include poverty, lack of proximity, 
cost, not having documentation or identification, lack of financial literacy, low 
acceptability, risk aversion, and low levels of trust. Cultural factors also play an 
important role. Banks and most formal financial institutions are unwelcoming to 
the poor, whose numerous and tiny transactions would be unacceptably costly 
for most formal institutions to handle. Even microfinance institutions require a 
group dynamic for savings and lending to the poor.
The technology for going digital and enhancing financial inclusion is sound 
and proven, the concept is appealing to both policy makers and donor com-
munities, and service providers have found it to be a viable business case.

Critical Enablers That Are Game Changers in Successful E-money Deployments
However, successful adoption and deployments are still few and far between. 
To date, cash remains the preferred medium of transactions in developing 
countries and even in many developed countries. So what is holding back 
application of digital systems and e-money for the delivery of affordable, 
accessible, and appropriate financial products, especially to people who are 
excluded from or underserved by formal financial markets?
Almost all of the transformational technologies are proven and available as 
off-the-shelf solutions that need little or no customization, at affordable prices. 
Hence, it is reasonable to expect that successful deployments—such as the M-Pesa 
mobile money platform in Kenya and social grants transferred through a biometric-
enabled debit MasterCard in South Africa—could easily be replicated. However, 
such expectations have often met with disappointment when restrictions, 
insufficient  underlying conditions, or other challenges constrained attempted 
deployments from achieving the kind of traction shown by those success stories.
Digital finance and payment services have transformed the lives of many 
people across the globe. The Mobile Economy 2015—a report by the London-
based Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA)—counted 255 live mobile 
money services across 89 markets as of December 2014. The number of regis-
tered mobile accounts also grew to reach 299 million, with a majority of the 
accounts in Sub-Saharan Africa (figure II.1).
Nevertheless, the full potential of mobile money deployments remains 
untapped in some regions, such as Latin America and South Asia, partly because 
of regulatory barriers. Realizing the role that nonbank mobile money providers 
can play in fostering financial inclusion and economic growth, an increasing 
number of regulators are establishing new regulatory frameworks for mobile 
money. In 47 out of 89 markets where mobile money is available, regulation now 
allows both banks and nonbanks to provide mobile money services in a sustain-
able way, the GSMA report found.
The main purpose of Part II of this volume is to understand which factors 
enable successful deployment of digital money initiatives and why so few coun-
tries have succeeded in becoming fast movers with tremendous results. The study 
investigates the extent to which barriers are unique to each market, e-money 
deployment mechanisms, client segments and country context, and what lessons 
can be applied more generally.
Through analysis and examination of the case study countries and their 
respective e-money deployments, Part II of this volume identifies a set of critical 
enablers that have shaped the successes by unlocking value that allows for trans-
formational outcomes. “Critical enablers” are game changers in enhancing the 
effectiveness and efficiency of e-money schemes in a transformative manner. 
They could be either general social enablers or program-specific enablers that 
help overcome major barriers to service proliferation. The lessons learned can 
benefit countries that plan to launch or are already in the process of launching 
similar initiatives, by identifying early implementation priorities.
At the macro level, such enablers include progressive policy leadership and an 
enabling, nonprohibitive regulatory environment. At the meso and micro levels,

key factors include innovative use of infrastructure; an ecosystem characterized 
by interoperability; effective agent network management; mobile money add-on 
applications; and biometric-enabled, card-based grant payment disbursement 
systems. A basic requirement on the customer-level supply side is the ability to 
uniquely identify clients.
The case studies in this volume are used to illustrate how these factors have 
enabled some countries to rise above the rest in terms of ubiquity, speed, lower 
costs, simplicity, efficiency, and safety of their respective e-money deployments. 
In some cases, however, failure to address these key elements has hindered them 
from reaching the full potential of e-money deployments.

Introduction
According to World Bank 2014 Global Findex data, 2 billion largely poor people 
worldwide lack access to a financial transaction account, of which 30 percent 
live in three South Asian countries—Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.1 As such, 
governments and policy makers are prioritizing strategies and policies to make 
poverty reduction and economic development a reality, especially for the rural 
poor. Policy makers have to broaden their scope and commitment to make mean-
ingful investments in responding positively to market innovations that open up 
new ways of delivering financial services. In doing so, while enabling inclusion 
strategies, policy makers will have to also ensure compatibility with financial 
stability and consumer protection.
Achieving financial inclusion requires greater emphasis and understanding 
of the poor and rural markets to establish a suitable enabling environment. 
Peake (2012) sums this up as follows:
The rural customer segment has distinct characteristics compared with its urban 
counterpart. In most countries, agriculture and related activities represent a signifi-
cant percentage of rural incomes, which typically result in seasonal flows and ebbs 
of income. Rural actors ... face greater constraints in terms of distance, travel times 
and infrastructure development ... so trust plays a huge role in engaging with them. 
Rural areas are also known to have lower literacy levels, lower mobile handset pen-
etration rates and poorer network coverage. Finally, rural consumers are typically 
slower to adopt new brands and products but are also slower to give them up.
The factors cited by Peake apply broadly to people at the base of the pyramid, 
regardless of their geographical location. This understanding drives the policy 
leadership and regulatory efforts in certain developing countries to design and 
create policy and regulatory frameworks for innovative strategies to include the 
poor—or at times to allow for market developments in advance of regulatory or 
policy reforms.

Policy Leadership and Enabling Regulatory Environments
To effectively harness the transformative potential of innovative digital 
financial products, mechanisms, and transactional networks, numerous legal 
and regulatory issues have to be addressed early on, including acceptable 
identification and validation of customer information; consumer protection 
in terms of information, funds, and dispute settlement processes; and how 
to apply legal and regulatory standards and guidelines. Sensible policy mak-
ers and regulators do not discourage these interventions by boxing them-
selves into preconceived regulatory mind-sets that overemphasize risk and 
returns or conform to conventional existing frameworks. Regulators in the 
more successful cases are open-minded and allow markets to come up with 
solutions that are workable, by allowing for pilot efforts that can be scaled 
up and then ensuring that broader regulatory parameters are appropriately 
adapted.
Regulatory Balance in Financial Innovation
Financial sectors are essentially a means to an end, facilitating financial inter-
mediation to serve the real economy. Regulators of financial systems are 
entrusted with maintaining financial system stability, protecting consumer 
rights, and ensuring orderly market conduct. Although innovative financial 
systems and products have the potential to more efficiently allocate resources 
and support growth and development, certain innovations can bring in negative 
externalities and disrupt markets. As in the case of the global financial crisis, 
there is a risk of regulators scrambling to ring-fence the systems with draconian 
regulations.
An ideal regulatory balance would involve making complete information 
available for regulators to decide well in advance on the prudential norms 
needed to achieve safety and soundness, while market participants are allowed 
to be as innovative as they want to be. In reality, innovations may appear sud-
denly, and regulators may have to make a judgment call based on limited 
information.
With respect to policy leadership and an enabling regulatory environment, the 
analysis of the case study countries will answer key questions, as follows, involv-
ing prime examples of leadership:
•	 Why the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) allowed M-Pesa to launch in a regulatory 
vacuum
•	 Why India’s Jan Dhan Yojana program has the potential to be the flagship 
financial inclusion plan of the decade
•	 How Thailand’s joint policy and regulatory vision contributes to enhanced 
financial inclusion in the country
•	 How Sri Lanka ensures that regulations keep pace with technological advance-
ments that drive market developments
•	 How proactive policy leadership could enable two early movers—the 
Philippines and Maldives—to reach their full potential

Kenya: Leadership Lesson from the Central Bank of Kenya
The best example of an open-minded regulatory approach that led to transfor-
mative changes in poor people’s lives is Kenya’s M-Pesa mobile money platform. 
While much of the literature tries to explain why M-Pesa is hugely successful in 
Kenya and less so elsewhere—a one-of-a-kind success story that cannot readily 
be replicated—it is important to understand the key concepts that made M-Pesa 
a success.
Launch and Early Years of M-Pesa
The regulator’s initial decision to allow the scheme to proceed on an experimen-
tal basis, without formal approval, was critical. Before the launch of M-Pesa in 
2007, the CBK was aware of the woeful status of formal financial outreach in 
Kenya, which, at 19 percent, was highlighted by the FinAccess National Survey 
in 2006 (figure 4.1).
Soon after, when approached by the mobile network operator Safaricom, 
CBK realized the potential of leveraging mobile-based payments to enhance 
financial inclusion. CBK diligently reviewed all aspects of allowing mobile 
money in Kenya, while being mindful of the risks that this yet-unknown model 
might bring. Based on the details of M-Pesa’s risk assessment and mitigation 
structure as well as opinions on the legality of allowing M-Pesa to function, CBK 
satisfied itself that
•	 M-Pesa could legally operate mobile-money business, and in doing so, it would 
not be conducting banking business;

is a graphical method (routinely used in FinScope Surveys in Africa) of placing each survey respondent along 
a continuum of access, depending on use of services by category. “Formal” refers to the share of the 
population using a bank, banklike institution, Postbank, or an insurance product. “Formal other” refers to the 
share using semiformal services from nonbank financial institutions (such as microfinance institutions) not 
bank services. “Informal” refers to those using only informal financial service providers such as rotating 
savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) and groups or individuals other than family and friends. “Excluded” 
refers to those using no institutionalized financial services.

•	 The risk management structure was adequate for consumer protection; and
•	 The pooled trust account in a reputable commercial bank, where money 
collected by Safaricom’s agents is deposited, ensured that there would be no 
intermediation and also satisfactorily addressed the consumer credit risks.
CBK realized that, under the existing laws such as the Banking Act, they 
could not formally license or directly regulate the nonbanking institution on 
money transfer. However, it had full supervisory oversight of the pooled trust 
accounts that M-Pesa would hold with the commercial banks. Furthermore, 
the CBK Act (which established CBK in 1966) granted CBK broad powers 
to establish, regulate, and supervise payment and settlement systems. At the 
time CBK was considering the M-Pesa proposal, the National Payment 
Systems bill was still in draft mode. Instead of blocking the launch of M-Pesa 
until the National Payment Systems bill was passed, CBK issued a letter of 
no objection to Safaricom with conditions for consumer protection, preven-
tion of money laundering, and regulatory reporting requirements.
M-Pesa was launched in March 2007 (see box 4.1). To its credit, CBK asked 
Safaricom to undertake two comprehensive technical assessments by Consult 
Hyperion2 to evaluate the operational risk and efficiency of the M-Pesa plat-
form; cleared the legal issues; and, once M-Pesa was launched, got a demand-
side survey done through the Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) Kenya Trust in 
2008. Although Kenya was not yet compliant with the Financial Action Task 
Force’s (FATF) Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting Funding of Terrorism 
(AML/CFT) guidelines, Vodafone (the majority shareholder of Safaricom, 
which developed M-Pesa) ensured that the platform complied with its own 
international standards as well as with Kenyan legislation.
CBK came under tremendous pressure—from a disgruntled banking 
community, the political leaders, and the media—for allowing a nonbank to enter 
the payment space. The commercial banks were hostile to what they perceived as 
Safaricom’s entrance into their field of financial service delivery. This hostility was 
exacerbated by the fact that the banks were not permitted to commence agency 
banking until 2010. However, having done its due diligence, CBK was able to 
convince the political leaders of the merits of using this unconventional route to 
enhance financial inclusion, and also used the opportunity to highlight the gaps 
in the regulatory system due to not yet having payments laws in place.
Thereafter, CBK and the Ministry of Finance issued joint statements 
informing the public of the due diligence process conducted by CBK and also 
gave assurance on the operational safety of M-Pesa. CBK relied on moral sua-
sion and mutual cooperation with Safaricom. The CBK’s National Payment 
System Department deliberately focused its oversight of M-Pesa—and of all 
subsequent mobile money services—on the integrity of the information technol-
ogy (IT) platform and the service delivery system, and it continually monitors 
transaction flows and operations. Soon after M-Pesa’s 2007 launch, CBK also 
conducted an audit of M-Pesa to confirm that M-Pesa is not a savings instrument.

Box 4.1  M-Pesa: A Backstory and an Alternative Perspective
Mobile network operator Safaricom was formed in 1997 as a fully owned subsidiary of 
Telkom Kenya—Kenya’s sole provider of landline phone services. In May 2000, Vodafone Group 
PLC of the United Kingdom acquired a 40 percent stake and management responsibility 
for the company. In 2002, Safaricom was converted to a public company while the govern-
ment held 60 percent of the shares, 25 percent of which would be auctioned off in 2008 on 
the Nairobi Securities Exchange.
The M-Pesa story begins with the U.K. Department for International Development’s 
(DFID) formation of the FSD Trust in 2000. FSD awarded funds to Vodafone,
which partnered with its affiliate Safaricom in Kenya to conduct workshops with 
financial institutions to identify the barriers to increasing access to financial services. 
A partnership was formed between a microfinance institution (MFI), a bank, and 
Safaricom to develop a pilot to enable microfinance loans to be paid with the help of 
mobile phones. (Cook 2015)
Funding from DFID through a competitively awarded challenge grant allowed a pilot to 
be launched taking a “test and learn” approach. In 2007, there were no regulations applicable 
to a mobile money service. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) took the brave step of allowing the 
innovation to move ahead, taking a risk-based approach. M-Pesa was launched in March 2007 
focusing on its core money transfer function, marketed as “Send Money Home.”
It is suggested that the government’s bold regulatory decision to allow the launch of 
M-Pesa without the tight regulatory restrictions found in many other countries was driven by 
the following key factors:
First, the business model had been thoroughly piloted and tested as a project under the 
regulatory radar with flexible funding from FSD Trust.
Second, the government was the majority shareholder in the company that stood to ben-
efit and had a dominant market position, meaning that
•	 Risk to the company from failure of the program was relatively small;
•	 Risk to the financial system likewise was relatively small, since the government was a 
backer; and
•	 Competitors were not in a strong position to lobby against the dominant, government-
owned company—and they probably had no idea that M-Pesa would be so successful.
That CBK was willing to take a risk was also quite likely a legacy of the success of K-Rep 
Bank as a microfinance commercial bank, which had helped change attitudes in CBK as it 
supported legislation enabling MFIs to be licensed separately from banks.

All these good practices have enabled CBK to develop the necessary robust regu-
latory framework subsequent to commencement of M-Pesa’s actual operation.
M-Pesa’s Impact on Financial Inclusion
CBK’s willingness to step outside of its comfort zone in the interest of a worthy 
public cause has unlocked great opportunities for poor people to better manage 
their money. Today, the financial inclusion rate in Kenya has risen to a remarkable 
75 percent,3 and M-Pesa is not the only operator active in the market. However, 
there are many things Kenya can do even now to ensure that the system func-
tions smoothly, more affordably, and with a more level playing field.
According to the 2013 FinAccess Survey (FSD Kenya 2013), financial access 
is moving away from reliance on the informal sector, whose net addition to 
financial inclusion over formal financial institutions fell from 33 percent in 2006 
to less than 8 percent in 2013 (figure 4.2).
Furthermore, the FinAccess Survey shows that mobile service provider use 
has achieved astoundingly rapid growth in penetration, from 0 percent of the 
population in 2006 to around 62 percent in 2013 (figure 4.3).

Note: “Formal prudential” access refers to individuals whose highest reported financial services use is through 
providers that are prudentially regulated and supervised by independent statutory regulatory agencies. 
“Formal nonprudential (including mobile money)” access refers to those whose highest reported financial 
services use is through providers subject to nonprudential oversight by regulatory agencies or government 
departments or ministries with focused legislation. “Formal registered” access refers to individuals whose 
highest level of financial services use is through providers registered under a law or government direct 
interventions. “Informal” access refers to individuals whose highest reported financial services use is through 
unregulated forms of structured provision (FSD Kenya 2013).

The Regulator’s Journey since M-Pesa’s Launch
The National Payment System Act came into effect in 2011. The focus of the 
Act’s regulations was, however, on the large-value, high-systemic-risk payments 
through the CBK’s Kenya Electronic Payment and Settlement System. CBK 
pretty much left the retail payments system to self-regulate.4 Under the 2011 
Act, CBK recognized and established a payment system management body with 
delegated powers to manage risks and governance issues and to support develop-
ment of the national payment system.
In August 2014, a formal legal framework for mobile money was finally issued 
as the “National Payment System Regulations, 2014”5 more than seven years after 
CBK’s no-objection letter that facilitated the launch of M-Pesa. To help put 
things in perspective, during the 2014/15 fiscal year, M-Pesa had over 15 million 
active users transacting K Sh 4.2 trillion (US$4.32 billion) through the mobile 
money platform, equivalent to 42 percent of Kenya’s gross domestic product 
(GDP). There is no question that if CBK had decided to uphold the status quo 
in 2006, most average Kenyan people would still be without access to the main-
stream financial system.
India: Jan Dhan Yojana Flagship Financial Inclusion Plan
If crores of Indians are outside the ambit of organized financial services because 
they do not have a bank account even after 68 years of independence, I call it 
financial untouchability. Gandhiji ended social untouchability, it is our mission 
to eradicate this kind of untouchability now to fight poverty.

Financial Inclusion Efforts in India
Financial inclusion is not a new concept to India. With over 1.25 billion peo-
ple, financial inclusion has a special meaning, as over one-third of the world’s 
poor live in India. Both the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 
have been pursuing this goal over the past several decades through building the 
rural cooperative structure in the 1950s, the nationalization of the banks in the 
1960s, and the expansion of bank branch networks in the 1970s and 1980s.
These initiatives have paid off in terms of a network of branches across the 
country: by March 2013, there were also 93,488 Primary Agricultural Credit 
Societies in the country, 31 State Cooperative Banks, and 372 District Central 
Cooperative Banks (Sivaiah and Naidu 2015). Scheduled commercial banks also 
reached out into rural areas, with 49,571 branches and 504,142 Banking 
Correspondents in villages by 2015 (Patel 2016).6 The major institutional inno-
vation in India for expanding financial system access and use for the poor and 
marginalized sections of the population is the program that links banks with 
self-help groups.7
Yet, the extent of financial exclusion has remained staggering. Out of the 
1.7 million total habitations (distinct clusters of houses at the subvillage level) in 
the country, only about 30,000 had a commercial bank branch as of 2012 
(Chakrabarty 2012). Only about 40 percent of the population across the country 
had bank accounts. The proportion of people having any kind of life insurance 
coverage was as low as 10 percent, and the proportion having non-life insurance 
was an abysmally low 0.6 percent. People having debit cards comprised only 
13 percent and those having credit cards only a marginal 2 percent.
As of 2011, only 46 percent of India’s small and marginal farmers were able 
to obtain credit from either institutional or noninstitutional sources (Patel 2016). 
Even though RBI has mandated agriculture credit to be around 18 percent of the 
adjusted net bank credit, commercial bank data show that it was around 10.5 
percent in 2013. Out of this, only about 4.5 percent reached the rural farmers, 
while the rest went to urban and suburban agriculture projects (Rao 2015).
The rating agency CRISIL, a Standard & Poor’s company, has a financial 
inclusion index called the Inclusix. The all-India Inclusix score is 40.1 
(which means that about 40 percent of the country has access to formal 
banking services). There are wide variations, from 62.2 percent in the 
southern region to 28.6 percent in the eastern region (Wharton School 
2014). The 50 bottom-scoring districts have just 2 percent of the country’s 
bank branches (CRISIL 2013).
The high-powered Nachiket Mor Committee on Comprehensive Financial 
Services for Small Businesses and Low-Income Households, set up by the RBI, 
found that 60 percent of the rural and urban population did not have a func-
tional bank account (RBI 2014). One of the committee’s recommendations was 
to set up a vertically differentiated banking system.
Accordingly, guidelines were issued by RBI and licensing effected for two new 
types of finance institutions in unbanked and underbanked regions: (a) “payments 
banks,” which focus on remittance and payment services and accept demand

deposits (current and savings) but cannot provide credit facilities; and (b) “small 
finance banks,” which can offer a wide range of deposit (current, savings, and 
time deposits) and credit products, primarily microcredit, and also provide pay-
ment and remittance services.
The importance of this yet-to-be-proven payments bank concept is that it 
enables institutions with wide-reaching agent networks such as mobile net-
work operators (MNOs) to offer payment transactions in a scaled-up fashion. 
Their challenge would be to match the already low-cost alternative transmis-
sion mechanisms that thrive in India and to attract customers to deposit with 
them. At some point in time, regulators will have to rethink the prohibition 
on payment banks offering credit products. The basic premise is that there 
has to be a business use case for them to proliferate.
Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana: A Big Bang Approach to 
Financial Inclusion
Two weeks after his Independence Day address to the nation on August 15, 
2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally launched a mammoth financial 
inclusion program: “Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana” (PMJDY), also known as 
Jan Dhan Yojana (JDY), which translates as “Prime Minister’s People’s Wealth 
Program.” Touted as the biggest financial inclusion initiative in the world, the 
scheme aimed to take banking facilities to 75 million households within a period 
of five months, that is, by January 26, 2015.
By May 2015, banks had reportedly far exceeded the target set by the prime 
minister and opened approximately 159 million accounts, according to a survey 
of 210 million households in the country (table 4.1). In the first week of the 
scheme’s launch—August 23–29, 2014—18.1 million accounts were opened, 
and the event entered the Guinness Book of World Records. Of the accounts 
opened, 60 percent are in rural areas and 40 percent in urban areas. The share of 
female account holders is about 51 percent.
The success of account openings was partly due to people getting a package 
deal when opening an account. Every account holder received a RuPay debit card, 
launched by the RBI-promoted National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), 
with an inbuilt accident insurance coverage of Rs 100,000 (approximately US$1,650)

and a RuPay Kisan credit card; and an overdraft facility of Rs 5,000 activated 
after six months of operation of the account. An incentive of life insurance cover-
age of Rs 30,000 was offered for those opening accounts before January 26, 2015 
(celebrated as Republic Day in India) (Economic Times 2014).
Phase I of the scheme targeted three goals in the first year of implementation: 
universal access to banking facilities, provision of financial literacy, and provision 
of basic banking services. Phase II (August 15, 2015, to August 15, 2018) included 
the creation and development of a Credit Guarantee Fund to cover defaults in 
overdraft accounts and to provide microinsurance8 and unorganized sector pen-
sion schemes. Coverage of households in hilly, tribal, and difficult areas and 
including every adult or student in all households is also planned.
The second phase is important because recent (2013) National Sample 
Survey Office (NSSO) data show that there are close to 57.7 million small-scale 
business units, mostly sole proprietorships, that undertake trading, manufacturing, 
retail, and other small-scale activities (Debu C 2015). Comparatively, organized 
sector and larger companies employ 12.5 million individuals. Today, the 
micro- and small-business segment is unregulated and without financial support 
from the formal banking system.
The promised Credit Guarantee Fund (Phase II activity) was launched in April 
2015 as the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd. (MUDRA) 
Bank, with capital of Rs 200 billion (US$3.13 billion) and a credit guarantee fund 
of Rs 30 billion to address the issue of lack of access to funds faced by small entre-
preneurs. Although the government had considered evolving the MUDRA Bank to 
be the regulatory body for MFIs, this plan did not proceed. Nevertheless, MUDRA 
provides its services to small entrepreneurs outside the service area of regular 
banks, by using “last mile” agents. About 5.77 crore (57.7 million) small businesses 
have been identified as target clients using the NSSO survey of 2013. Only 4 percent 
of these businesses get finance from regular banks.
Challenges to Jan Dhan Yojana
One of the major concerns that haunts the Ministry of Finance is that about 
54 percent of the accounts opened have zero balances (table 4.1). Criticisms also 
include that JDY was a public-bank-driven exercise. However, both of these 
trends seem to be waning (figure 4.4).
The banking sector is realizing that the JDY scheme can bring in huge oppor-
tunities in the years to come. Banks will be able to offer microfinance and related 
products to people across the country. The question is whether the scheme is 
likely to make rural operations more profitable for banks. As stated earlier, rural 
accounts make up 60 percent, and regional rural banks 18 percent, of the total 
JDY accounts opened to date (PMJDY 2015). The government has successfully 
addressed the challenge of getting accounts opened.
Through this initiative, savings from these typically low-income households 
are now brought within mainstream banking. However, getting customers to 
use these accounts is the second challenge. Because some of the offers become 
validated only once the account is operational, this is a matter for concern. 

Policy Leadership and Enabling Regulatory Environments	
73
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5	
The accident insurance will come into effect only if at least one transaction 
takes place within a 45-day period. The overdraft facility will depend on the 
balance in the account. Given the poverty and illiteracy among the target 
groups, a comprehensive awareness campaign is a must. The trend in zero-
balance accounts is downward-sloping, which is encouraging (figure 4.4). 
Hence, it looks as if the government’s awareness campaign is working.
Direct Benefit Transfers: Key Enabler for Jan Dhan Yojana
The potential game changer for financial inclusion could be the direct benefit 
transfers (DBTs) channeled through JDY bank accounts. The government is 
hastening this process by linking all accounts to India’s Aadhaar unique identifi-
cation (ID) program. Once this is completed, the flow of money from govern-
ment schemes to the beneficiaries will become seamless.9 The bank will also 
enjoy the benefit of the float if all government payments to beneficiaries are 
transferred to these accounts. In addition, there is a proposal that the government 
pay the banks a 2 percent commission on the total DBT payments handled. 
However, the banks are negotiating for 3 percent plus a tax adjustment. Whatever 
the negotiated amount finally agreed, it will have to make business sense for the 
banks if efficiency is to prevail.

The saving on leakages that occur in various subsidy schemes will more than 
compensate for the cost of this massive exercise of financial inclusion. Leakages 
are estimated to be between Rs 500 billion and Rs 750 billion (around 5 percent 
of GDP).
Realizing that incentives are needed to keep these accounts from remaining 
or turning dormant, the government is inclined to channel all benefits, including 
state and local government benefits, through these accounts. Though DBTs and 
the mandate for continued eligibility for accident insurance coverage are incen-
tives to operate the bank account, there is nevertheless the risk that many 
accounts not covered under DBTs may fall into dormancy. Even for accounts 
covered by DBTs, operations may be confined to receiving the DBT remittances 
and withdrawal. However, notwithstanding the realities of how poor people 
operate basic no-frills accounts, the potential for a program to bring millions of 
unserved people into the formal financial system is a remarkable feat.
Digitizing the Last Mile Connectivity
The biggest challenge for the JDY program is to deliver financial services using a 
sustainable and scalable model. Even though the government and RBI have taken 
measures to expand the access channels, a scaled-up digital payment system is 
not yet widely available in India. Hence, the full potential of digital financial 
services in India has not yet been realized.
However, since 2006 in Andhra Pradesh, social welfare payments have been 
disbursed electronically, through around 26,000 female self-help group mem-
bers, to 16 million accounts. In fiscal year 2012/13 alone, the government of 
Andhra Pradesh channeled US$1.2 billion worth of social welfare payments 
through electronic channels, and this is expected to increase. Andhra Pradesh was 
the first state in India to implement an electronic payment channel at scale 
(CGAP 2013). With the DBT scheme rolling out countrywide, there are lessons 
to be learned from the initial efforts in Andhra Pradesh.
Given the inadequacies in banking infrastructure as access points to the 
general public, digital payments and the payment banks can play a significant role 
in making financial access a reality. In addition, using India Post—with 155,000 
post offices, of which nearly 90 percent are in rural areas—is also considered an 
effective way to provide service touchpoints.
One significant shortcoming that is also a huge opportunity is that India 
lags significantly behind in mobile payments. The Consultative Group to 
Assist the Poor (CGAP) reported that control by the banks of not only credit 
and savings but also the payments market has restricted the use of mobile 
money to only 0.3 percent of adults in India (Kumar and Radcliffe 2015). 
With 900 million mobile connections in 2013 across India—expected to rise 
to 1.16 billion by 2017—mobile connectivity presents the perfect opportu-
nity to increase the use of e-money (figure 4.5). According to the Telecom 
Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), there were 350.37 million rural sub-
scribers by 2013 (TRAI 2013). The MNOs already manage a distribution 
infrastructure and large agent network of 2–2.5 million touchpoints, and they

already address the needs of low-income consumers by designing products 
such as Rs 10 (US$0.16) airtime reload vouchers (MMAI and GSMA 2013).
Realizing this potential, in 2014 RBI brought in transformative regulatory 
reforms that enable the use of this untapped network of agents to expand the 
transaction points across India so that people can readily access basic banking 
services and potentially cash out their subsidy payments without incurring addi-
tional cost in terms of time as well as money (box 4.2).
In addition to RBI regulations, TRAI issued guidelines that require mobile 
operators to provide banks with unstructured supplementary service data 
(USSD) channel access for mobile banking. This will ensure that banks can lever-
age mobile operators’ communications channels when offering mobile banking 
(Kumar and Radcliffe 2015). To facilitate greater adoption of mobile banking, 
RBI recommends that all MNOs preload a standard single mobile-banking appli-
cation in the form of a short message service (SMS), and the government has 
mandated this addition to all new phones.
The NPCI also plays its part in this important initiative by setting up a next-
generation USSD-based mobile banking service: the National Unified USSD 
Platform (NUUP). Accessible through a common code (*99#) dialed from a 
mobile phone, NUUP allows every customer to access banking services with a 
single number across all banks—irrespective of the telecom service provider, 
mobile handset make, or the region. However, NUUP is only available on Global

Note: 2G, 3G, and 4G refer to the “generation” of the mobile-phone network; the higher the number, the faster the download speed as a measure 
of how quickly information can be transferred from the Internet to a phone. 2G mobile networks are handled by simple cell phones for basic 
e-mails and texts. These second-generation or 2G phones, which are also low-cost and suitable for poor people worldwide, are quite adequate for 
mobile money applications that operate by sending short message service (SMS) or texts.

System for Mobiles (GSM) mobiles and not on Code Division Multiple Access 
(CDMA) mobiles.10 A platform common to all banks—instead of each bank hav-
ing to develop its own platform—is a strategic move by NPCI to help banks focus 
on customers while NPCI manages the technology behind the platform. NUUP 
is currently available in 11 languages. NPCI and the regulators successfully 
brought in all 12 MNOs.
NUUP is using the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) platform, which is a 
real-time interoperable payment mechanism by NPCI. IMPS offers an instant, 
24-hour, 7-days-a-week interbank electronic funds transfer service through mobile 
phones. IMPS transfers money instantly within banks across India through mobile, 
Internet, and automated teller machines (ATMs), which is not only safe but also 
economical both in financial and nonfinancial terms. There are no charges on 
NUUP transactions. However, IMPS fund transfer charges would be applicable.
Sri Lanka: Regulations Keeping Pace with Technological Advancements
The dawn of the Mobile Money era in Sri Lanka has been made possible by 
the progressive, and financial inclusion focused, regulatory ethos of the Central 
Bank of Sri Lanka. In this respect Sri Lanka’s Payments and Settlement 
Legislation and Mobile Payment regulations stand among the most progressive

•	 Payments bank guidelines are to allow companies with significant distribution expertise 
(including mobile operators, retail chains, and existing agent managers) to offer deposit 
accounts and payments as a stand-alone business.
•	 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lifted its prohibition against banks establishing agents more 
than 30 kilometers from the nearest bank branch. The 30-kilometer rule has befuddled the 
financial inclusion sector for years by preventing smaller banks with limited branch networks 
from building national agent networks. By lifting this restriction, the RBI effectively leveled 
the playing field between large and small banks, at least when it comes to agent banking. 
And once payments banks come online, they will be able to establish agents without 
­worrying about building brick-and-mortar branches to comply with the 30-kilometer rule.

address for opening a bank account. This requirement was particularly tricky for migrant 
laborers who have trouble securing documents that prove their current address.
•	 Nonbanking finance companies can now act as business correspondents. This will allow 
India’s microfinance institutions—many of which already serve millions of poor customers—
to build agent networks on behalf of banks.

and Vodafone M-Pesa, could allow their customers to cash out. RBI has removed that restric-
tion, creating more options for nonbank providers to offer payment services.

in the world. Emboldened by the support and facilitation received from the 
Central Bank, Telecommunication Regulatory Commission and our custodian 
bank [Hatton National Bank], we are confident that this pioneering initiative 
to deliver a nationwide Mobile Money will deliver an unprecedented level of 
financial inclusion through the empowerment of millions of Sri Lankan citizens 
with electronic money transfer and payment facilities.
—Hans Wijayasuriya, group chief executive, Dialog Axiata PLC, 
at the launch of eZ Cash, June 2012
A good financial sector regulatory framework should be simple and 
effective, protect consumers, and reward innovation by being flexible enough 
to adapt to changes in the markets, while combatting money laundering and 
fraud. More often than not, frustrated innovators claim that regulators cannot 
keep pace with the rapid changes and technological developments in the 
industry, while skeptical regulators maintain that such innovations may do 
more harm than good. Often it is a balance between these two extreme view-
points that would make a good enabling regulatory system that fosters respon-
sible innovation. Risk management systems should keep pace with the 
complexity of new financial products to ensure that there are no pervasive 
failures in consumer protection; transparency and standards should be main-
tained to allow for fair market conduct and competition; and gaps and weak-
nesses in the supervision and regulation of these newcomers to the market 
may have to be addressed in innovative ways.
Mobile money systems thrive on markets where banking density is very low 
or people are geographically widely dispersed, thus making financial access a dif-
ficult task. Sri Lanka has no serious issues in either category. Nearly 70 percent 
of the adults in Sri Lanka have accounts in formal financial institutions,11 and in 
their report “Deposit Assessment in Sri Lanka,” Leonard et al. (2011) noted that 
outreach of financial services in Sri Lanka can be considered fairly extensive, with 
a reported 82.5 percent of households having access to financial institutions for 
their savings and credit needs.
Since the 26-year civil war ended in 2009, the government and the Central 
Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) have spearheaded financial inclusion activities focus-
ing on the war-torn areas of the North and East emerging from the conflict. For 
example, banks were required to open two branches outside of the Western 
Province for every branch opened within the Western Province. By 2014, the 
Northern Province had the highest banking density (21.7 branches per 10,000 
people), and the Eastern Province the third highest (16.8 per 10,000) (Daily FT 
2015a). At the same time, the CBSL authorized testing of a mobile banking 
service, leading to the launch in 2012 of eZ Cash, which gained over a million 
customers within a year (di Castri 2013). Hence, in Sri Lanka, mobile money 
solutions offered by MNOs will always be one of many options available to 
access financial services, and will proliferate only if there is a simple and clear 
value proposition to the users.

78	
Policy Leadership and Enabling Regulatory Environments
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
CBSL decided to allow mobile money services through MNOs after making 
sure that necessary safeguards are in place. It is a trailblazer in enabling tech-
nological innovations by setting up benchmark regulatory practices that are 
both progressive and nonprohibitive. CBSL enacted necessary laws early on. 
It created a level playing field where both banks and nonbanks including 
MNOs can offer digital money; established enabling regulatory and oversight 
functions that are not overtly restrictive; ensured that customer rights and 
information are well protected; and worked with stakeholders across the board 
to understand market needs and innovations. These positive reforms did not 
happen overnight.
Legislative Background
Being a pioneer in the South Asia region to adopt technology-based financial 
services, Sri Lanka has broader legislation than its regional neighbors for payment 
systems and electronic transactions—and a wide range of payment instruments 
and payment services to support the country’s banking and finance industry. 
CBSL has always been at the helm, providing leadership, guidance, and a legisla-
tive framework to enable such developments.
The most significant decade in terms of regulatory enactments relating to 
payment reforms and e-money in Sri Lanka has been the 2001–10 period. 
Under the central bank’s modernization project that commenced in 2001, 
CBSL’s objectives have been redefined by an amendment to the Monetary Law 
Act in 2002 to recognize financial system stability as a statutory objective in 
addition to the price and economic stability objective. Starting with this 
momentous amendment, a series of other important financial regulatory laws 
were enacted during this period.12 Additionally, several amendments were 
introduced to the existing laws to facilitate new payment and settlement sys-
tems and processes (Jayamaha 2014).13
The rapid pace of the passage of these laws indicates the proactive leadership 
of CBSL in establishing the core legal infrastructure required to facilitate the 
developments of electronic transactions and mobile payments. As part of the 
payment systems modernization undertaken in 2001, to improve efficiency and 
enhance the level of integrity, the Payment and Settlements Systems Act (PSSA) 
was enacted as the comprehensive legislation governing payment, clearing, and 
settlement systems. The Act provided CBSL with oversight and regulatory pow-
ers over the national payment system as well as payment systems and money 
transfer service operators. PSSA was the key legislation that enabled nonbanks to 
offer mobile money services.
The Electronic Transactions Act of 2006 provided the underlying framework 
for electronic and mobile transactions, based on the model laws developed by the 
United Nations (UN) Commission on International Trade Law, which recognizes 
and enables enforceability of electronic transactions, and the UN Electronic 
Communications Convention. Three fundamental policy-related principles form 
the basis of the Act: (a) technology neutrality, (b) functional equivalence, and (c) 
party autonomy. Technology neutrality is ensured by not dictating the technology

to be given legal preference. Hence, unlike statutes in some countries, the 
Electronic Transactions Act in Sri Lanka does not specify any technology that 
should be used, allowing businesses and consumers to determine technology 
options based on types of use.
Sri Lanka became the first country in South Asia (and one of the first three in 
the Asian region, along with China and Singapore) to sign the UN Electronic 
Communications Convention in July 2006 (Fernando 2013). In terms of the 
provisions of this Act, all transactions and business done in electronic form would 
be recognized and valid, with the exception of excluded items (under section 23 
of the Act) such as last wills, powers of attorney, and transfers of immovable 
properties, to name a few. This Act also facilitated Sri Lanka’s e-government 
services available through the Lanka Gate web portal.
In July 2015, Sri Lanka ratified the UN Electronic Communications 
Convention, another first for South Asia and the second country after 
Singapore to become a State Party to the Convention. Countries such as 
Australia, China, Thailand, and Vietnam are already preparing domestic legis­
lation to ratify this Convention. Jayantha Fernando, legal adviser to Sri Lanka’s 
Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA), said this of the 
action: “Sri Lanka’s ratification of this Convention will ensure greater legal 
certainty for e-commerce and e-business providers who wish to use Sri Lankan 
law as the applicable law and ensure international validity for other interna-
tional legal instruments as well as cross-border fund transfers, enhancing the 
ability of Sri Lanka to fast-track its move towards paperless trade facilitation” 
(Daily FT 2015b).
Sri Lanka has also adopted the recommendations of FATF and enacted sev-
eral laws enabling CBSL to issue AML/CFT guidelines and regulations to all 
financial sector players and payment systems providers.14 Furthermore, realiz-
ing the need for greater information security, the Payments Devices Frauds Act 
(No. 30 of 2006) and the Computer Crimes Act (No. 24 of 2007) provided a 
unique investigation and enforcement regime. More recently, Sri Lanka became 
the first country in South Asia to be invited to join the Budapest Convention 
on Cybercrime.15 Although the much-needed Secured Transactions Act 
(No. 49 of 2009) was enacted with the intention of establishing an online reg-
istry for movable assets, amendments are needed to include new provisions to 
enable movable and mobile collateral to be accepted as sureties.
Institutional Infrastructure
The ICTA of Sri Lanka, the government’s apex information and communication 
technology (ICT) institution, ably supported CBSL in establishing key legislation 
and a comprehensive information security framework for the financial sector to 
ensure greater consumer confidence as the financial sector transitions toward a 
cash-lite electronic mode. ICTA addressed the legal validity and enforceability of 
electronic transactions—the main concerns for the financial community in tran-
sitioning to electronic mode—by spearheading the enactment of the Electronic 
Transactions Act in 2006.

CBSL has empowered LankaClear to be the national payment infrastructure 
provider for retail payments.16 Driving Sri Lanka toward an efficient, green, and 
paperless nation, LankaClear provides the necessary technological platforms and 
gateways that are cutting-edge and cost-efficient and allow for seamless connec-
tivity. Some of these are groundbreaking and the first in South Asia. These solu-
tions are both efficient and secure.
Among them, the LankaSIGN certification service provider (CSP) imple-
mented by LankaClear in 2009 provides the much-needed security for the 
electronic payment systems and is currently the only commercially operated CSP 
in the country. Development of the Common Card & Payment Switch (CCAPS) 
by LankaClear under the guidance of CBSL is an important ongoing initiative in 
the retail payment arena.
LankaClear also hosts the Bank Computer Security Incident Response Team 
(Bank CSIRT). Bank CSIRT, a joint initiative of CBSL and the Sri Lanka 
Computer Emergency Response Team (SLCERT), is a specialized service unit 
that is responsible for receiving, reviewing, processing, and responding to com-
puter security alerts and incidents affecting the banks and other licensed financial 
institutions in the country. Commercial banks provide guidance and funding for 
Bank CSIRT. Through LankaClear, Bank CSIRT will have the prime responsibil-
ity to coordinate security efforts within the banking and financial sector.
In addition, a special unit called the Cyber Crime Investigations Unit is estab-
lished in the Criminal Investigations Department of the Sri Lanka Police Service. 
It is reported that CBSL and SLCERT are jointly taking the initiative to prepare 
legislation and regulations necessary to deal with cybercrimes.
As a result of this legislative framework, Sri Lanka has an excellent payment 
systems infrastructure and possibly the best financial regulatory framework in the 
region to govern e-money for e-commerce and e-government programs. In the 
World Bank’s 2008 Global Payment Systems Survey, the legal and regulatory 
framework of Sri Lanka’s payments system was rated at the “High Level of 
Development” (Cirasino and Garcia 2008; World Bank 2008). The highest rat-
ings were given for system design and key policy decisions that affect the safety, 
soundness, and efficiency of the system.
Notwithstanding the excellent institutional infrastructure that enables innova-
tive solutions, the most important institutional arrangement from the mobile 
money perspective is the coordinated regulatory collaboration between CBSL 
and the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL). 
The expansion of digital technologies has altered the ways in which financial 
services are delivered and accessed. Thus, regulators are presented with a number 
of challenges, specifically regarding consumer protection and due diligence.
The uniqueness of e-money is that it overlaps different regulatory domains, 
thus risking a mismatch of regulations and potential coordination failures. 
By coordinating proactively and by converging the service delivery and customer 
protection paradigms of the telecommunications and banking sectors, the two 
regulatory authorities in Sri Lanka were able to provide a comprehensive yet 
flexible mobile money regulatory and oversight framework where CBSL would 

Policy Leadership and Enabling Regulatory Environments	
81
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5	
take the lead. TRCSL is agreeable and pledges support to cooperative efforts to 
ensure smooth implementation of regulatory initiatives.
Leveling the Playing Field
CBSL realized early on that an effective, inclusive digital financial system 
requires a level playing field so that private sector players such as MNOs can 
offer competitive products and services efficiently and at a lower cost, using their 
ready-made network of reload agents as touchpoints. While not creating unneces-
sary hurdles for the MNOs, and ensuring that safeguards are met, CBSL decided 
on an iterative approach.
Unlike in most other countries, the already-enacted PSSA in 2005 gave CBSL 
the necessary powers to authorize MNOs to offer mobile money. In 2007, CBSL 
authorized the National Development Bank (NDB), a smaller commercial bank, 
to issue a mobile money service jointly with Dialog Axiata, the leading MNO in 
the country,17 which wished to pilot a bank account–based mobile money system. 
The regulatory framework required the customers to have a bank account to be 
able to sign up for this mobile money service called “eZ Pay” (subsequently 
upgraded to “eZ Cash”). Although two more banks and a registered finance com-
pany also joined, the system did not scale up easily, and it ended up having only 
around 15,000 customers.
In this case, even though Dialog Axiata operated under NDB to offer the 
mobile money service, NDB required the same level of identity verification 
from mobile money clients as from bank customers. The success of mobile 
money and scaling-up depends on the ability to speed up the wallet account 
opening process and to minimize steps in transacting. Realizing that customers 
were not interested in signing a plethora of documents to verify their identity 
in signing up for bank accounts, Dialog Axiata asked CBSL to consider an 
MNO-led mobile banking solution without requiring a bank account to be 
opened by customers. CBSL reexamined the guidelines and reviewed the sub-
missions by Dialog Axiata to operate an MNO-led mobile money solution 
using the customer information already available in their mobile-phone 
contracts. Even though the yet-unfolding global financial crisis and the collapse 
of a local credit card company were, at the time, putting pressure on the regula-
tor, CBSL was aware that limiting innovation and competition would result in 
suboptimal noncompetitive solutions that would affect financial inclusion as 
well as financial system stability in the long run.
At the same time, consumer protection and information safeguards were pri-
mary considerations. Addressing all these concerns, in 2011 CBSL issued two 
distinct mobile money guidelines, for the bank-led model and the MNO-led 
model under PSSA.18 Accordingly, mobile money or payment cards service pro-
vider licenses could be granted to
•	 A licensed commercial bank;
•	 A licensed specialized bank;
•	 A finance company;

82	
Policy Leadership and Enabling Regulatory Environments
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
•	 An operator that provides cellular mobile telephone services under the author-
ity of a license issued under the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act (No. 25 of 
1991) as amended; or
•	 A company registered under the Companies Act (No. 7 of 2007) having an 
unimpaired capital of at least Rs 150 million or such other amount deter-
mined by the Central Bank, other than a company limited by guarantee, an 
offshore company, or an overseas company, within the meaning of the 
Companies Act.
By issuing these comprehensive and broad guidelines under PSSA, CBSL 
opened up the horizon for a broad and growing range of providers with different 
value propositions to participate in the payment services industry.
Proportional, Risk-Based Know-Your-Customer Requirements
Unlike banks and traditional payment methods, mobile payments pose regula-
tory challenges in addressing AML/CFT risks. Such risks stem from the lack of 
face time with customers, leading to difficulties in identification and verifying 
income sources. Dealing with MNOs and transacting across a vast number of 
agents who traditionally are not from the financial sector also pose challenges for 
financial institutions and regulators.
On the other hand, overly strict requirements regarding the identification 
and verification of customers risk exacerbating financial exclusion. FATF rec-
ommendations encourage the use of (a) differentiated customer due diligence 
(CDD) measures according to the profile of the (future) customer for cus-
tomer identification; and (b) “progressive” or “tiered” CDD as a risk-based 
“know-your-customer” (KYC) method. This would mean that people lacking a 
government-issued ID or formal proof of address can be allowed basic access 
with limited functionalities using alternative identification methods. Access to 
a wider range of services and higher transaction limits may be allowed when 
additional CDD requirements are met. Hence, transaction and payment limits 
or wallet sizes vary based on the KYC or CDD requirements met.
Sri Lankan citizens who are 16 years and older and reside in Sri Lanka are 
required to apply for the national identity card (NIC) issued by the 
Registration of Persons Department. The NIC is regarded as the key ID docu-
ment for identification and authentication of persons. Also in Sri Lanka, sub-
scriber identification module (SIM) registration is mandatory, hence MNOs 
already have copies of national ID cards and photographs as well as digitized 
versions in their databases.
Considering these facts, CBSL applied the proportional risk principle that 
allows low-value mobile wallets to be automatically enabled via the customer 
dialing in using the customer information already available to the MNOs in the 
mobile contract. Higher-limit mobile wallets would require customers to visit an 
MNO kiosk and provide additional CDD-related paperwork. This means that 
almost all mobile subscribers (22.12 million subscribers, or 107 percent of the 
population in Sri Lanka) are able to operate a basic e-wallet if they so wish,

just by dialing in. A low initial registration burden for basic wallet size reduces 
customer resistance to registration and hence enables faster growth in the use of 
mobile money.
Regulatory Oversight
Due to the very nature of mobile transactions, mobile money initiatives are 
deemed to be low-value, low-risk systems. Hence, oversight and monitoring of 
service providers is not expected to be as extensive as supervision conducted for 
banks and other financial institutions that are also subject to prudential norms 
such as the Basel Core Principles (BIS 2012). However, the magnitude of mobile 
money proliferation in Kenya suggests that such initiatives have the potential to 
become systemically important payment systems.
Because of the innovative nature of these initiatives, often the laws and regula-
tions have gaps and gray areas that create oversight challenges and may lead to 
negative reactions by the regulatory authorities. For example, in 2014, China’s 
central bank suspended mobile payments initiated through Quick Response 
(QR) codes amid security concerns regarding the identification process involved 
with those transactions. The bank’s decision immediately affected China’s two 
largest third-party mobile payments providers: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. 
(which operates Alipay) and Tencent Holdings Ltd.19 In Kenya, M-Pesa func-
tioned for more than seven years without a regulatory framework before CBK 
was able to pass the National Payment System Regulations in 2014.
In Sri Lanka, having the PSSA enacted in 2005 afforded greater clarity and 
transparency to the oversight role of CBSL, and the Act legally empowered the 
CBSL to regulate, supervise, and monitor the payment systems and service pro-
viders. Thus, understanding the need for legal certainty,20 CBSL issued regula-
tions under PSSA to license the mobile payment service providers.21 Thereafter, 
mindful of the innovative nature of mobile money services and lessons learned 
from previous mobile money deployments that failed to gain traction, CBSL 
issued the Mobile Payments Guidelines (No. 2 of 2011) for Custodian Account 
Based Mobile Payment Services, which provides the monitoring framework for 
nonbank service providers to operate. Issued under the PSSA, these regulations 
and guidelines ensure that the regulation and oversight function supports pay-
ment system stability and also instills public confidence in mobile money ser-
vices. The reporting requirements and regulatory and oversight provisions are 
clearly set out in the guidelines. Moreover, CBSL has also entrusted the custodian 
bank of the licensed service provider with the additional responsibilities of for-
mulating KYC and CDD procedures for the service provider, monitoring and 
supervision of the service provider for compliance with regulations and guide-
lines, and auditing of all e-money accounts with the service provider (an MNO 
in this case).
Customer Protection
In line with good-practice prudential requirements, CBSL requires the MNOs to 
“ring-fence” the customers’ funds in custodian accounts at licensed commercial banks. 

84	
Policy Leadership and Enabling Regulatory Environments
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
According to the guidelines issued, it is mandatory that the e-money accounts be 
updated by the service providers on a real-time basis and that the cumulative 
sum collected from all e-money account holders be maintained in the custodian 
accounts at all times.
Additionally, a trust is established by execution of a trust instrument admin-
istered by Deutsche Bank AG over the funds held in the custodian account. 
Hence, in the event that either the service provider (the MNO) or the custo-
dian bank becomes insolvent, customer funds in the pooled account will be 
protected.
Customer Education and Grievance and Redress Mechanisms
The regulators should ensure that service providers educate customers about 
using security features and the importance of protecting their personal infor-
mation. Hence, there should be transparent, effective, and straightforward 
complaint mechanisms and recourse. To this end, CBSL has directed the 
service providers to develop an appropriate dispute resolution mechanism 
based on guidelines that will be issued by them to handle disputed payments, 
transactions, and loss of mobile phones. Service providers are required to 
establish a call center to respond to customer inquiries and complaints and to 
be responsible for addressing customer grievances in the event a customer 
files a complaint about a disputed transaction. Charge-back procedures for 
addressing such customer grievances are to be formulated by the service 
providers.
The early enactment of PSSA allowed CBSL to establish focused yet flex-
ible regulatory mechanisms to regulate e-money. The cornerstones of this 
successful regulatory framework were a nondiscriminatory licensing regime; 
consumer protection and safeguarding of funds; reduction of operational risks 
and establishment of tiered KYC and CDD measures; and appropriate over-
sight mechanisms augmented by use of prudentially regulated custodian 
banks to monitor and assist with e-money operations of the nonbank service 
provider. Ably supported by an enabling regulatory framework, eZ Cash has 
the distinction of being the first mobile money system in the world to be 
end-to-end interoperable across multiple service providers, thus bringing for-
ward a combined subscriber base of over 14 million Sri Lankans who could 
transact electronically via eZ Cash.
Thailand: A Government’s Vision and Policy to Bring Cash 
to the Doorstep
According to the 2013 FinScope Survey, in Thailand 97 percent of the adult 
population have accessed formal financial services: 74 percent of the adult 
population have bank accounts, while an additional 23 percent have used for-
mal nonbank financial services (FinScope 2016). With another 2 percent of the 
population using informal financial services, the financially excluded popula-
tion in Thailand is only 1 percent (figure 4.6).22 These ratios are similar in all

four regions of the country, with the Bangkok area showing higher access 
through banks at 86 percent (figure 4.7).
The high level of access can be attributed to the deliberate policies pursued 
by the Royal Thai government (RTG) over the years to extend financial services 
to the underserved and unserved population. These policies have been largely

government-led and government-financed. The commercial sector has played a 
relatively minor role in providing access to credit and insurance, while taking the 
lead in savings and remittances (ADB 2013a).
One government strategy was to involve state-owned financial institutions, 
such as agricultural cooperatives and the Village and Urban Revolving Fund 
(Village Fund). The Village Fund is a semiformal institution established in 2001 
by the RTG after the 1997 financial crisis to make credit available to the villages. 
The Thailand Village Fund is the second largest microcredit scheme in the world. 
RTG provided initial seed money of B 1 million (US$28,700) to each of 
Thailand’s 74,000 villages and 4,500 urban communities. Hence, nearly 80,000 
elected local Village Fund committees administer loans that reach 30 percent of 
all households (Boonperm et al. 2012).
In addition, the good leadership role played by the Bank of Thailand (BOT) 
in enhancing financial inclusion and actively implementing strategies, policies, 
and regulations to ensure an enabling environment was also instrumental in 
increasing access to finance. BOT emphasized its commitment to financial inclu-
sion in its recent Financial Sector Master Plan (Phase II, for the period 2010–14), 
with the aim of increasing efficiency, promoting inclusion, and providing con-
sumer protection, and it has entered into discussions with commercial banks 
concerning business models that might help reach the rural poor (BOT 2009).
BOT also is looking into extending services tailored to the needs of unbanked 
and underserved populations, while maintaining stability in the system. According 
to BOT’s financial access survey for 2010, of the 878 districts in Thailand, 302 
(34.4 percent) do not have commercial bank branches. However, when branches 
of specialized financial institutions (SFIs) are included, the number of districts 
with no branch service drops to 92 (10.5 percent). This is largely due to the 
strong rural presence of the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives 
and the Government Savings Bank’s primarily urban footprint. When Village 
Funds are included, the financial services footprint extends to virtually 100 percent 
of the country (ADB 2013a). Hence, the recent decision by BOT to extend its 
supervisory and regulatory mandate to SFIs is an important regulatory develop-
ment because of their extensive coverage of rural and poor communities in 
providing a much-needed source of funds. Proper regulatory guidelines are 
needed to manage risks as well as to protect consumers.
A proactive and respected Thai Bankers’ Association (TBA) ably supports 
BOT. TBA is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) Bankers Association and plays a key role in representing the banking 
community in discussions with BOT, the Ministry of Finance, and other govern-
ment bodies in formulating and implementing key economic and financial poli-
cies. TBA also works closely with the Foreign Banks’ Association on various 
banking issues, including improvements to the payment and settlement systems. 
TBA has been a valuable partner to BOT and its Payment Systems Committee 
in fostering efficient, safe, and sound infrastructure to enable access to financial 
and payment services by the Thai people and in supporting economic 
development.

The development of financial infrastructure that enhances outreach to a wider 
customer base is an integral part of Thailand’s success story. Under guidance from 
BOT, banks in Thailand are expanding their infrastructure covering all four 
regions of the country (map 4.1).

Despite the economic contraction in 2013 that led to reductions in transac-
tion volumes, mobile banking and Internet banking showed significant growth. 
The key payment infrastructure in the country comprises bank and nonbank 
branches, the Internet, mobile phones, ATMs, cash deposit machines (CDMs), 
and electronic funds transfer at point of sale (EFTPOS) terminals. This wide 
array of payment infrastructure ensures payment services to customers that are 
not restricted to bank and nonbank branch working hours.
In both 2012 and 2013, Thailand recorded significantly higher numbers of 
ATMs per 1 million persons (810 and 877 ATMs, respectively) than the average 
of Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) countries (437 
and 488 per 1 million persons, respectively).23 Among Thailand’s regions, ATM 
penetration indicates that, except for the Northeastern region (383 machines), 
the other three regions have higher ATM penetration per 1 million persons 
than  the average for CPMI countries: Northern (524 machines), Southern 
(849 machines), and Central (1,977 machines).
However, the number of EFTPOS terminals per 1 million people (4,099 in 
2013) was around half of the CPMI country average of 8,788 terminals (BOT 
2013). In addition, although mobile-phone penetration was 142.7 percent, the 
number of mobile agreements was only around 1.16 million (1.8 percent of the 
population), indicating further opportunities for improvement (BOT 2013). 
In addition, Thailand’s MNOs are already providing payment services and 
focusing on capturing the untapped market segments. The downside is that the 
proprietary mobile payment services and stand-alone systems used by each 
operator do not allow interoperability among MNOs, thus limiting uptake 
among users.
BOT is well aware that consumers in rural areas still face access as well as 
knowledge issues in terms of using e-money, and as a result, use the services 
of  community financial institutions and informal sources at a higher cost.24 
The assessment on potential touchpoints by the 2013 FinScope Survey reveals 
that, while it takes an average of close to 36 minutes to reach a bank branch or 
ATM for the rural population, it takes only an average of 8 minutes to reach a 
grocery store (figure 4.8).
Hence, there is opportunity to provide financial services at a more affordable 
cost. BOT has issued agent banking regulations that allow for retailers to act as 
banking agents as well.25 Already, Counter Service Co. Ltd. delivers payment 
services through more than 700 franchise holders. It has recently partnered with 
7-Eleven stores and has access to their more than 8,300 outlets to deliver pay-
ment services.26 7-Eleven is now the most popular provider of utility and other 
payments in the country. Other providers include Jay Mart and Tesco Lotus. All 
these stores also offer point-of-sale (POS) devices and prepaid phone airtime 
replenishment (“top-up” services). Payment services are competitively priced and 
range from B 10 (around US$0.30) for utility bills to B 15 (around US$0.45) for 
payments due to some commercial banks and insurance companies (ADB 
2013a). It is important to expand these services further to cover underserved 
areas and communities. The use of banking agents such as retail stores, as well as 

Policy Leadership and Enabling Regulatory Environments	
89
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5	
mobile money solutions, would be the most cost-effective way to improve access 
to finance and payment services in these areas.
Banks also offer fund transfers competitively through their ATM networks 
(56,851 ATMs throughout Thailand in 2013 [BOT 2013]). ATM transfers are 
done free of charge within the same bank, while charges between two different 
banks cost around B 30 (about US$0.90). If the ATM of a different bank is used 
for withdrawals, up to four transactions per month are free of charge, while trans-
actions beyond the fourth will have a B 10 fee. Moreover, Thailand Postal 
Company also acts as a banking agent to commercial banks and uses its 1,295 
post offices to perform banking services. (Unlike retail shop payment agents, post 
offices are allowed to accept deposits.) The above analysis indicates that banks 
dominate the funds transfer and remittance markets.
An Interoperable, Multifunctional, Efficient ATM Network
Thailand is one of only three ASEAN member countries (along with Indonesia 
and the Philippines) that have full ATM interoperability, meaning that infor-
mation can be exchanged across different technology systems and software 
applications (World Bank 2011). The fully interoperable ATM networks have 
expanded payment services such as bill and other payments as well as remit-
tance transfers, and even airline e-ticketing and tax payments can be carried 
out at these stations. In addition, automated deposit machines (ADMs, also 
called CDMs) offer a cash deposit service, while passbook update machines 
(PUMs) provide convenience to customers without visiting bank branches. 
Some banks have unique three-in-one compact terminals featuring integrated

note acceptance, dispensing, and self-service passbook update. The terminals’ 
cash recycling capabilities also reduce operational costs for the banks.
The efficiency of the ATM network is also attributable to the National 
Interbank Transaction Management and Exchange (ITMX) Company, the 
interbank payment infrastructure provider.27 ITMX supports all types of 
electronic payments and funds transfers from various channels, including 
ATMs, counters, Internet, phone, and mobile channels, and it fosters interop-
erability among banks by using a secure and efficient open platform. 
This eliminates the need for individual financial institutions to upgrade and 
maintain their own payment infrastructure systems. From the clients’ per-
spective, interoperability has allowed them increased access through more 
bank-neutral touchpoints.
Another important element in Thailand’s extensive ATM network is efficient 
cash management. With more and more banks focusing on providing ATM ser-
vices to customers farther away from their head offices or even branches, it is 
important to manage timely cash replenishment and 24/7 service. In Thailand, 
specialized cash management companies such as G4S (a global integrated secu-
rity company) manage ATMs on behalf of banks, including cash forecasting, cash 
transportation, reconciliation services, first-line maintenance, and ATM engineer-
ing services. All of these activities significantly contribute to the efficiency with 
which banks provide payment services to their clients.
In reviewing Thailand’s financial inclusion strategy, it is apparent that 
although digital finance plays a significant role in the payment space, cash is 
still the dominant medium and seen as a free service by banking sector clients 
because of low transaction costs. Use of service providers by different customer 
groups shows the dominance of banks in the remittance and fund-transfer 
space (table 4.2). Efficiently managed ATM proliferation has given banks the 
leading edge in these areas.

Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5	
The importance of proximity to touchpoints in utility payments is evident in 
the fact that retail chains such as 7-Eleven play a major role in this payment area. 
By regulation, savings and deposit markets are served only by banks and nonbank 
financial institutions such as SFIs. Looking at the market structure and the type 
of customers, it is evident that poor and underserved customers have limited 
access to digital money and payments, given that Village Funds, other community-
based organizations, and cooperatives are cash-based. Hence, there is a huge 
opportunity for digital finance to reach the poor and the underserved, who 
are primarily being served by these institutions.
The Thailand case study reveals the impact of efficient coordination of 
policies and strategies toward payment services and access to finance through 
reduction of infrastructure costs by having single or near-single interoperable 
platforms. It also brings to light the government’s and BOT’s strategic involve-
ment in these efforts.
Going forward, even though cash-based payments through ATMs and 
EFTPOS terminals are well coordinated in Thailand, cash is not the most effi-
cient method of payments. Cash management imposes a high cost on govern-
ments, banks, and even businesses. There are many other payment modes that are 
more efficient and safer than cash, and moving toward e-money and digital 
finance should be Thailand’s next goal. Cash has to be provided by BOT at a cost, 
and that does not help financial deepening. Cash-led financial systems find it 
difficult to graduate to the next level because of the retail focus of cash-based 
transactions.
From a macroeconomic point of view, Thailand has to come out of its 
middle-income trap by elevating small and medium enterprises (SMEs), micro-
enterprises, and retailers to middle-income groups. E-money and e-commerce are 
the needs of the day. There is an opportunity for BOT to introduce new regula-
tions and best practices for MNOs and other payment service providers to enter 
into the trade.
From a financial inclusion perspective, if mobile money services become 
interoperable and connect with the SFIs and also link with retail chains, the 
opportunity to reach the poorest by digital means will be limitless. These systems 
should encourage and incentivize the use of alternatives to cash. Furthermore, 
cost efficiencies would be significant in terms of reducing the high cost of cash 
management to the government as well as to other stakeholders. BOT appears 
to be aware of these benefits and plans to address these issues through its pay-
ment systems development strategy as well as the financial inclusion strategy.
The Philippines: The World’s Oldest Mobile Money Initiative 
Has Yet to Reach Potential
The Philippines was one of the pioneers and earliest adopters of mobile money 
services, even before Kenya’s M-Pesa became a household name. Launched in 
2001, Smart Communication’s SMART Money service was the first to market; 
Globe Telecom’s GCash service followed in 2004. Despite being early movers in 

92

the game, mobile money hasn’t scaled up to the levels initially predicted. 
By 2014, active mobile money users were still fewer than 7 million on a com-
bined subscriber base of over 105 million mobile subscribers. In 2014, 69 percent 
of the population had neither an account in a formal financial institution nor a 
mobile money account—hence were excluded from the formal financial 
sector.28
The archipelagic structure of around 7,100 islands in the Philippines poses a 
big challenge to financial access, with most people living a great distance from 
financial services. Transporting money also has serious security concerns in the 
islands. As of 2014, more than 605 of 1,634 cities and municipalities did not have 
banks, and around 8 million people were living in these unserved areas (BSP 
2015).29 Conversely, almost 43 percent of all deposit accounts in the Philippines, 
amounting to 71 percent in value terms, were in the National Capital Region, 
commonly known as Metro Manila, with a population of just over 12 million of 
the Philippines’ 100 million population (Tayag 2014).
At a glance, therefore, the Philippines seems to be the ideal place for mobile 
money to proliferate. Mobile-phone penetration is over 110 percent, and the 
country is called the texting capital of the world, with over a billion texts sent 
every day (GSMA 2014).30 The Philippines has the eighth largest number of 
Facebook users in the world, and 36 percent of the population use the Internet. 
Furthermore, the average monthly remittances from overseas Filipinos to their 
beneficiaries in the Philippines have exceeded US$2 billion since 2013 (Martin 
2017).31 Moreover, the policy makers and regulators are flexible in enabling 
innovative money services to function. Hence the low mobile money user num-
bers continue to baffle the mobile money experts. While there can be many 
constraints for mobile money adoption and digital inclusion in the Philippines, 
this study examines the policy and regulatory aspects that help or hinder this 
process.
Regulators Creating an Enabling Environment
The Ministry of Finance and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) have played an 
active role in creating an enabling environment to extend financial services to 
the poor and rural regions of the country. BSP adopted the “test-learn-­regulate” 
model by allowing two nonbank institutions to offer e-money, and it issued 
progressive regulations and guidelines. In doing so, BSP aimed to increase 
financial outreach as well as to provide more options for people to receive 
international remittances32 with the intention of reducing the cost of remit-
tances through increased competition. By issuing Circulars Nos. 240 and 269 
in 2000, BSP enabled e-money issuance.33
Consequently, SMART Money piloted and launched a bank-led model in 
partnership with Banco De Oro (BDO). Although Smart Communications 
manages the product and branding, the underlying prepaid “e-wallet,” which 
is not considered to be a deposit, is held with BDO and is also linked to a 
SMART Money MasterCard debit card that can be used at ATM and POS 
terminals.34

In 2004, Globe Telecom launched a nonbank-led model, GCash, through 
a fully-owned subsidiary called G-Xchange Inc. by obtaining a license as a 
remittance service provider. The acceptance of money by a nonbank was 
deemed not to fall under the definition of banking, because no intermediary 
function was completed by the on-lending funds so received. GCash funds 
received by G-Xchange are held in partner commercial banks as wholesale 
deposits. These flexible but ad hoc arrangements that enabled operation of 
both types of e-money models were largely formalized under one regulation 
with the issuance of Circular No. 649 in 2009. This circular regulates both 
bank-led and nonbank-led models under one license for e-money issuers 
(EMIs).
To better understand the technological developments and innovative 
­solutions offered by the service providers and the associated risks, in 2005 
BSP established a specialized team of former bank examiners and informa-
tion systems experts, the Core Information Technology Support Group 
(CITSG). CITSG on-site inspections follow COSO5335 guidelines on inter-
nal controls and, among other aspects, examine logical access controls, record 
keeping, audit trail, disaster recovery, and business continuity planning. This 
group studies mobile financial services and other electronic financial ser-
vices, their risks, and effective supervision methods. All specialists are certi-
fied in information systems auditing (Chatain et al. 2008). In 2006, guidelines 
were issued on technology risk management to ensure that banks have the 
knowledge and skills necessary to understand and effectively manage their 
technology-related risks.36 In addition, guidelines for consumer protection 
for e-banking were issued in 2006.37
Following the 2001 placement of the Philippines on the FATF list of non-
compliant countries and territories, both BSP and the Ministry of Finance 
worked diligently to make progress toward implementing plans to fight ter-
rorism finance and money laundering. As a result, the Philippines was subse-
quently removed from the FATF watch list in 2005. The country demonstrated 
a strong commitment to implementing an AML/CFT regime in the context 
of its financial inclusion strategy. The AML regulation issued for mobile 
money includes the conduct of KYC and CDD procedures, record keeping, 
and reporting of suspicious transactions to the Anti-Money Laundering 
Council.
Regulatory Barriers that Hinder Scaling-Up
Although progressive policies adopted by BSP in finding innovative solutions to 
enable e-money operations by bank as well as nonbank EMIs resulted in success-
ful e-money deployments of both types of models, scaling-up of these operations 
remains below expectations to date. In the absence of the Payment and 
Settlement law,38 BSP proactively issued e-money regulations and operational 
guidelines under BSP’s charter. Passage of the Payment and Settlement law will 
provide greater clarity on the regulatory mandate and enhance BSP’s legal and 
enforcement authority.

In the absence of such broader powers, it appears that some of the regulations 
issued by BSP have had unintended consequences. Given the earlier blacklisting 
by FATF, BSP had issued detailed AML/CFT guidelines, which were very restric-
tive on the use of agents. According to Circular No. 471 of 2005, all agents have 
to be registered with the BSP as remittance agents by providing appropriate 
documentation and are subjected to the AML Act. Such agents also have to 
attend mandatory AML training seminars typically held in Manila.39 Additionally, 
according to the guidelines, every time funds are transmitted or received 
(cash-in/cash-out), the agents are mandated to maintain originator information 
by requiring the sender to fill out personal information, recipient, and source of 
funds, among other things. Transaction records are supposed to be kept for five 
years. The ID check is carried out once, using one of the 20-plus ID types 
approved by the BSP.40
Furthermore, the agents cannot perform opening of new accounts. Such oner-
ous rules are deterrents to the scaling-up of agent networks. As a result, the 
outreach of the MNOs has been limited, and people who want to use these 
services are discouraged. Authorities could consider allowing nonbank agents to 
open customer accounts, allowing remote registrations with lower thresholds, 
and allowing for tiered KYC procedures to encourage more agents and customers 
to participate in the mobile money schemes.
Mobile money services are trying to gain traction in the payment and 
funds transfer space against stronger and more established alternative chan-
nels, such as pawnshops for money transfer and banks or payment centers for 
bill payment. It is, therefore, crucial that mobile money providers offer a 
cheaper, less complicated solution to attract the lower-value segments. 
Hence, simpler regulatory guidelines would enable mobile money providers 
to compete in the low-income market by providing consumers with a low-cost and 
effective option, thereby addressing many of the Philippines’ financial access 
issues.
Maldives: Mobile Money Opportunity Still Knocking at the Door
The Maldives case study41 highlights why a unique solution developed to 
address a distinct financial access problem was not successful because of coor-
dination issues at the macro level between the policy maker and the regulator. 
Today, however, changed dynamics may provide a much-needed solution, as 
forward-thinking policy makers and the regulators are trying to resolve the 
persistent problem through a coordinated approach that would allow for a 
low-cost, innovative digital solution.
The Special Financial Inclusion Challenge in Maldives
Maldives is a challenging environment to deliver access to financial services 
through traditional bank branch networks. The country spans 1,190 low-lying 
coral islands that stretch over 90,000 square kilometers of Indian Ocean, 
99.5 percent of which is water. Nearly 338,400 people live on 200 scattered

inhabited islands in 26 atolls, and one-third of the inhabited islands have a popu-
lation of less than 500, while 71 percent of the inhabited islands have fewer than 
1,000 people (MMA 2015). Although the number of bank accounts exceeded 
the population by 2014, people living in the outer islands and atolls experience 
difficulties in accessing financial products and services through traditional 
banking outlets and existing financial infrastructure such as bank branches, 
Internet banking, ATMs, and POS terminals.
The wide geographical dispersion and lack of financial institutions and 
infrastructure translates into high transaction costs, decreased financial acces-
sibility, and greater security risks for people living and working in the atolls. 
For example, people reportedly often send their ATM cards along with their 
Social Security and personal identification numbers (PINs) through their 
friends or relatives to withdraw cash (pension money, remittances, and other 
receivables) from ATMs located in Malé or other islands where ATM services 
are available. Thus, cash remains the dominant payment instrument in the 
islands and outer atolls. Table 4.3 illustrates the increase in cash in circulation 
from 2007 to 2014.
Bank of Maldives (BML) is the largest commercial bank, with 27 branches (of 
which 20 are in atolls), 8 mobile Dhoni units,42 and 68 active ATMs (of which 
27 are located in atolls). As of April 2014, the government of Maldives owned 
62 percent of the shares of BML. The Bank recently launched self-service bank-
ing through 22 multifunctional ATMs installed across Malé and introduced its 
first U.S. dollar ATM at BML headquarters in Malé. To facilitate payment 
requirements of outer islands and atolls, BML operates an agent-based banking 
solution backed by BML banking agents in 70 islands through Internet banking 
and 3,610 POS card terminals (of which 1,087 POS merchants are in atolls 
including resorts). BML provides clearing and settlements through its own 
switch. According to BML, there is now a branch presence in every atoll in the 
country except one.
From BML’s point of view, it is neither economical nor scalable to provide 
agent-based banking services to all islands and atolls. In a rudimentary form, 
BML operates cash-back POS facilities as part of its agent-based banking services. 
By 2016, BML had announced plans to facilitate full person-to-person (P2P) 
transactions through app-based mobile-phone banking facilities (already started) 
and real-time POS transactions. This commitment was not fully realized.

Meanwhile, many of the islands are still being served by BML’s Dhoni cash 
distribution system and limited agent-based banking facilities. However, anec-
dotal evidence suggests that Dhoni banking is unreliable in some atolls, and the 
payment services offered by BML are unaffordable, even for those who live in 
Malé, because of relatively high transaction costs—a consequence of BML’s 
dominant position. For example, BML’s own card customers are required to pay 
2.5 percent of the total value of a transaction for using BML’s own POS machines, 
which is relatively high compared with other countries in the South Asia region. 
Hence, BML’s branch network, agent network, and infrastructure, although 
expanding, still leave many smaller outlying islands unserved.
On the other hand, operations of the other commercial banks (established as 
branches of foreign banks), with the exception of Maldives Islamic Bank Pvt. 
Ltd., are largely confined to Malé and mostly serve the corporate clients. 
Although Maldives Islamic Bank shows interest in community banking, other 
commercial banks have little interest in developing banking services in the outer 
atolls. A few nonbank institutions also operate POS acquisition services in resorts. 
Hence, in terms of availability and affordability of financial products and services, 
the solutions to date seem to have fallen short in providing adequate financial 
and payment services.
Seeking a Unique Solution to a Distinct Problem
To enhance access to finance and provide convenient payment facilities to 
people in the outer islands and atolls, in 2001, CGAP and the World Bank 
together designed and funded the Mobile Phone Banking Project (World Bank 
2015). The objective of the project was to build an integrated gross and retail 
national payment system with a first-of-its-kind interoperable payment 
switch that connects an interoperable mobile payment system (MPS, also 
named Keesa)43 that would allow all cooperating Maldives-based banks and 
all mobile telephone operators to share the payment infrastructure of the 
country and take advantage of the extensive infrastructure of small shops on 
all inhabited islands, which could serve as cash-handling points on behalf of 
banks and MNOs. The Keesa system would have allowed subscribers to make 
payments from and receive payments to these accounts via mobile handsets 
and the Internet very conveniently. The system was installed at the Maldives 
Monetary Authority (MMA), which completed the initial user acceptance 
testing of the system in August 2011. The design and commencement of the 
MPS was based on the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed 
between the banks and MMA.
Despite the technical completion of the system and willingness of most banks 
to serve their customers through Keesa, the project could not be operationalized 
because BML pulled out of the project during the last stages, citing business 
reasons. Given that BML accounts for more than 60 percent of the market share 
of customers and has 27 branches, its participation was crucial for the success of 
Keesa. Many attempts were made by MMA to reassure BML and accommodate 
its requests. MMA brought in added functionalities at the technical level to 

Policy Leadership and Enabling Regulatory Environments	
97

minimize the cost of interfacing for the participating banks, such as various 
reporting systems and a “Converter Gateway” to facilitate payments. However, 
BML refused to participate despite the MOU.
Unfortunately, the regulator (MMA) was unable to persuade BML to par-
ticipate in a national system that was designed to help provide access to a 
large segment of the society, and the major shareholder (Ministry of Finance 
and Treasury) was unwilling to interfere in BML’s business decision. The project, 
therefore, was closed in 2013, having only operationalized the real-time gross 
settlement (RTGS) system and part of the automated clearinghouse (ACH) 
and unable to operationalize the mobile banking and the interoperable pay-
ment switch. As a result, the outer islands and atolls still have limited finan-
cial access.
Positive Macro Dynamics: Collaboration between Policy Makers and 
the Regulators
Having realized the practical difficulties in moving toward a national payments 
switch in the short term given the market dynamics, MMA has now decided to 
establish a nonbank-led mobile money solution to facilitate financial access in the 
short term. Since MNOs are nonbank institutions that are not under the direct 
supervision of MMA, it is necessary for MMA to legally allow them to enter the 
payment space by issuing regulations governing the nonbank-led mobile solution 
to manage any operational risks as well as to establish public confidence in the 
proposed system.
MMA is keen to avoid overregulation and desires an interoperable, simple, and 
moderately regulated solution with low maintenance costs. This idea was strongly 
endorsed by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. The Communications 
Authority of Maldives also strongly endorsed an interoperable nonbank-led 
mobile-money solution where both MNOs participate to maximize the value 
proposition to the customers.44
This uniquely collaborative policy-regulatory drive had resulted in both 
MNOs showing a strong interest in launching mobile money solutions. 
Therefore, the government and MMA once again sought technical support 
from the World Bank in their efforts to establish an enabling environment for 
a nonbank-led mobile money solution aimed at enhancing access to financial 
and payment services in the Maldives, especially in the outer islands and 
atolls, and to ground this in a well-designed legal and regulatory framework. 
The World Bank advised the MMA and the government on this process by 
way of a Policy Note, and provided the technical support for this important 
initiative. 
Through two advisory engagements, the World Bank supported MMA and 
the  government. The first effort produced a May 2015 Policy Note entitled 
“Maldives: A Mobile Money Operator-Based Mobile Money Solution,” which 
provided a road map for implementing an MNO-led mobile money solution 
(M-Wallet). On September 25, 2015, the World Bank’s FIRST Initiative 
approved a three-year grant-funded technical assistance project entitled 

98

Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
“Maldives: Enabling a Non-Bank Mobile Money Solution.” The grant has pro-
vided the source of funds for expert advisory assistance to MMA, the govern-
ment, and Maldives’ MNOs to help implement (according to international best 
practice) custodian and trustee arrangements, risk mitigation and consumer 
protection, legal and regulatory amendments, and payment system oversight and 
coordination mechanisms.
Progress is slowly but surely being made. The enabling regulation for MNO-
led mobile money solutions has been provided for under the Maldives Monetary 
Authority Act while Maldives’ Payment Law still awaits enactment in Parliament. 
With enabling regulation in place, both MNOs have activated e-wallets. While 
interoperability and other synergies are still to come, the country is committed 
to learning from the lessons of international good practice and to providing 
greater levels of financial access to its citizens.

Innovative Uses of Infrastructure 
and Digital Ecosystems
Introduction
The development of digital services offers a huge opportunity to advance financial 
inclusion and develop new markets through business models that are viable for 
the base of the pyramid. A critical first step is to ascertain that a conducive digital 
ecosystem and infrastructure are in place that can reach down to the poor and 
vulnerable. For innovative digital financial initiatives to become reliable conduits 
for financial inclusion, they must be accessible quickly and efficiently to promote 
fast, reliable, simple, and affordable solutions. A major challenge is putting in place 
all of the elements needed to go the last mile in terms of connectivity.
This chapter focuses on the critical meso- and micro-level elements of 
interoperability; agent network management; mobile money add-on applications; 
and biometric-enabled, card-based grant payment disbursement systems. The 
analysis highlights the efficiency and proactive use of each of these elements by the 
case study countries in delivering results and reaching meaningful scale. In terms of 
financial inclusion, scaling-up does not mean just commercial viability; it implies 
reaching the unbanked masses in a sustainable manner. The case studies discussed 
in this chapter have reached or have shown the potential to reach scale and have 
demonstrated how the ecosystem and infrastructure can be used as a digital rail 
system to deliver an array of affordable services to the poor and the vulnerable.
Interoperability in Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, 
Tanzania, and Thailand
Competitive market conditions should be fostered in the retail payments industry, 
with an appropriate balance between cooperation and competition to foster, 
among other things, the proper level of interoperability in the retail payment 
infrastructure.

Payments Strategy”

Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
Results from the World Bank survey on innovations in retail payment instru-
ments and methods highlight that the majority of innovative products and 
mechanisms have limited interoperability, meaning that information cannot flow 
seamlessly between different operating systems and platforms (World Bank 
2012a). Less than 20 percent of the products were reported to be fully or 
partially interoperable. Around 25 percent of the products and services sup-
ported some mechanism to exchange funds with traditional payment products.1 
Although interoperability is considered to be best practice, evidently it is the 
exception rather than the norm.
Most digital financial systems launched are closed-loop systems and propri­
etary. Hence, the ability for the customers to transact with another service using 
a different provider’s platform is limited. On the other hand, enhancing the value 
proposition to the customers and furthering the social agenda through interoper-
ability may have costs in terms of possible higher rates,2 lower levels of account-
ability, and lower levels of investment resulting from greater difficulty in capturing 
revenues relative to proprietary or closed-loop systems. Hence, it is necessary to 
evaluate what level of interoperability a country should aim for based on the 
financial landscape, the desired or targeted level of deepening, and the strategic 
policy agenda. Ideally, payment system interoperability involves the ability of the 
various players such as banks, nonbank financial institutions, payment system 
providers, mobile network operators (MNOs), card acquirers, governments, busi-
nesses, and customers to send, receive, and process funds, documents, and other 
instruments electronically through a common channel.
“Interoperability” is defined as “a situation in which payment instruments 
belonging to a given scheme may be used in platforms developed by other 
schemes, including in different countries. Interoperability requires technical com-
patibility between systems, but can only take effect where commercial agreements 
have been concluded between the schemes concerned” (World Bank 2012a). In 
the context of retail payment, multiple levels of interoperability are identified: 
systemwide, cross-system, and infrastructure-level. A system that has only system-
wide interoperability enables competition among the participants of that system; 
a system that has cross-system interoperability enables competition between 
systems; and a system that has infrastructure-level interoperability enables the 
same infrastructure to be used to support multiple payment mechanisms.
Given the focus on mobile money as a digital means of reaching the under-
served, the study examines interoperability as one of the critical elements in 
enhancing financial and payment access to the poor. When a country has more 
than one MNO offering their own mobile money solutions on proprietary plat-
forms with their own operating rules and networks of agents, measures to 
achieve interoperability among MNOs are likely to be needed to optimize 
outreach to customers who are not served or who are underserved by the bank-
ing community and to benefit from economies of scale, as well as to discourage 
anticompetitive practices.
In reality, mobile networks are interoperable at a technical level, just as banks 
are. Banks are able to allow customers of another bank to use their automated

teller machines (ATMs) at a higher fee, as do mobile networks and service pro-
viders for calls between them. Although interoperability may exist at this techni-
cal level, at a functional or more practical level, such limited interconnectivity is 
not optimal.
In terms of mobile money interoperability, the important types are platform-
level interoperability (which permits customers of one service to send money to 
customers of another service); agent-level interoperability (which permits agents 
of one service to serve customers of another service); and customer-level interop-
erability (which permits customers to access their account through any sub-
scriber identification module [SIM]).
The most successful mobile operation, Kenya’s M-Pesa, is not a model for 
interoperability as it is a closed-loop system. If an M-Pesa account holder wants 
to send money to a non-Safaricom phone, they can do so and M-Pesa will gener-
ate a one-time code for them. The recipient will have to take this code to an 
M-Pesa agent and must cash out; it is not possible to add to his or her e-wallet. 
Hence, interoperability was not a factor in M-Pesa’s success.
Although M-Pesa’s market dominance acted as a barrier to interoperability, 
interestingly, the recently passed Kenya National Payment System Regulations 
2014 require “open systems capable of becoming interoperable with other pay-
ment systems in the country and internationally.” This newly minted provision in 
the regulations helped the Kenyan Competition Authority to end agent exclusiv-
ity, so that agents are able to offer their services to any MNO.
Countries such as Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, and Thailand have 
launched mobile money initiatives with diverse types of interoperability. Experiences 
from these countries are summarized in the subsections that follow.
Sri Lanka: World’s First Full End-to-End Interoperable Mobile Money System
When Dialog Axiata, Sri Lanka’s leading MNO, launched Sri Lanka’s pioneering 
mobile money service, eZ Cash, in June 2012, Sri Lanka already had high inclu-
sion numbers, with banks and nonbank financial institutions serving all parts of 
the island. The Global Findex Survey 2014 shows that 83 percent of adults had 
formal accounts in 2014, up from 69 percent in 2011.3 In 2014, the share using 
financial institutions for saving and borrowing were 31 percent and 18 percent, 
respectively. Genderwise, Sri Lanka has the highest equality in the South Asia 
region, with 83 percent of adult women having accounts. Furthermore, the poor-
est also show very high inclusion numbers at 80 percent, while adults in rural 
areas recorded a high 83 percent (table 5.1).
From the beginning, Dialog Axiata understood that mobile money would be 
one more option for the Sri Lankans, and that they would not likely be able to 
have an exclusive large footprint. They further realized that to compete with the 
already established financial sector, the products and services that Dialog offered 
would have to be tailored to the customers and provide more in terms of cost-
effectiveness, convenience, and value. Because not many Sri Lankans use credit 
cards or similar card instruments, Dialog championed the small but voluminous 
transactions that the banking sector was unlikely to pursue.

In an unprecedented move, Dialog invited other MNOs to share the eZ Cash 
platform, with the wallet to be jointly held and managed. In the Sri Lankan market 
at this stage, only Dialog and Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel had e-wallets. In 2014, 
Etisalat (the third largest MNO) and a few months later Hutch (the fourth largest 
MNO) also joined (figure 5.1). Hence, eZ Cash has the distinction of being the first 
mobile money system in the world to be end-to-end interoperable across multiple 
service providers. Dialog, Etisalat, and Hutch operate eZ Cash as a single wallet.
Today, the eZ Cash client base has grown to over 2.8 million Sri Lankan 
mobile users who are connected with 20,000 merchants and service providers 
through the country’s largest mobile payment and transaction gateway. The com-
bined subscriber strength of the three MNOs—over 15 million, or more than 65 
percent of the entire Sri Lankan population—now have instant seamless access to 
the full portfolio of eZ Cash services, and can transact electronically via eZ Cash.
The Fully Interoperable Model
Dialog has enabled access to eZ Cash services via an unstructured supplementary 
service data (USSD) menu by typing #111# on mobile phones. Etisalat and 
Hutch subscribers who register for the eZ Cash service use the same USSD 
menu. Even the costs (service charges) are the same (table 5.2). Interestingly, 
Mobitel (the second largest MNO in Sri Lanka), which launched a separate 
mCash wallet, has the same low fees.
The ability to simply dial in and self-register for the basic wallet without going 
to an outlet or kiosk is hugely convenient. Dialog currently has over 20,000

eZ Cash merchants around the country, and will continue to manage this agent 
network, while adding any customer service networks of the new providers on 
request. Dialog has also added to the network the flagship stores of Etisalat and 
the Hutch shops that are located around the country. Dialog also manages the 
back office and overall customer service issues that arise during the transactions. 
But issues faced by customers that the two MNOs bring into the service will be 
the responsibility of the respective MNO.
The system is enabled under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 
(No. 28 of 2005) by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) (figure 5.2). Hatton 
National Bank acts as the custodian bank for the entire eZ Cash service, and the 
trust agreement is administered by Deutsche Bank. A third-party service pro-
vider (KPMG)4 acts as the customer profile manager between the eZ Cash 
platform and Etisalat and Hutch, so that none of the MNOs have access to the 
customer profiles of the other.
The cost and fee structure is the same within the interoperable system. Sending 
money is free below SL Rs 500 (US$4) and sending more costs SL Rs 5 (US$0.03), 
while the fee for receiving money is staggered and ranges from SL Rs 5 (US$0.03) 
to SL Rs 100 (US$0.75).5 As can be seen by these low, affordable fees, the MNOs 
pass on value to consumers.
As for revenue sharing between Dialog and the other two providers, the trans-
action revenue from the eZ Cash service is shared with Dialog and covers the use 
of the eZ Cash brand, eZ Cash platform, and merchant network. Etisalat and 
Hutch save by not having to develop the mobile cash operation. As a result, shar-
ing (for a fee) the eZ Cash platform is a win-win situation for all.
Developments and Possibilities
To further its national agenda on financial inclusion, in July 2015 the CBSL gave 
permission to Dialog to engage in the inward remittance business. Hence, for 
the first time, a mobile money service in Sri Lanka is able to engage in foreign 
remittance services. With its islandwide reach and over 16,000-plus agent loca-
tions, eZ Cash continues to revolutionize mobile payments in Sri Lanka.

Remittances continue to be important to Sri Lanka, at around 9.6 percent of 
gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015. Inward foreign remittances to eZ Cash 
mobile wallets have been made possible via the partnership between eZ Cash 
and HomeSend, a joint venture created by MasterCard, eServGlobal, and 
Belgacom International Carrier Services, which enables cross-border and cross-
network value transfers. The partnership allows the migrant population overseas 
to transfer funds directly to eZ Cash mobile money accounts.
Sri Lanka’s experience with interoperability is a success story for South Asia. 
In  March 2015, eZ Cash beat out worldwide competition to win the Global 
Award for the Best Mobile Money Service at the annual Mobile World Congress 
in Barcelona, Spain (DailyFT 2015).6 The MNO-based e-wallet system operated 
by Dialog enables interoperability with other telecom operators; for the custodian 
bank, the infrastructure is MNO-neutral. When the national switch operated by 
LankaClear, the national infrastructure provider, links the mobile payment sys-
tems into the main platform, the e-money–based mobile operations will be able to 
provide enhanced interoperable 24-7 real-time clearing and settlement facilities.

network is fully interoperable. As previously discussed, this has enabled nation-
wide proximity to cash access as well as payment transactions.
The Bank of Thailand (BOT) has established the National Payment Message 
Standard to support the use of corporate e-payment transactions. This standard 
will significantly drive interoperability and straight-through processing, as well as 
reduce the cost of electronic connectivity.7 The BOT payment systems group has 
established a working group to develop a payment systems road map with the 
objective of establishing common e-money standards and developing the infra-
structure for e-money to facilitate interoperability among different e-money 
operators. However, BOT has decided to follow a market approach in determin-
ing the feasibility of future developments.
Pakistan: Interoperability between Banks and MNOs, Even for 
Over-the-Counter Customers
Pakistan’s Easypaisa mobile money service became the first in the country to 
interoperate with the existing banking structure through the Inter Bank Fund 
Transfer (IBFT) service, which enables customers to transfer funds between a 
number of banks via the 1LINK switch.8 The IBFT service is available to both 
Easypaisa mobile account holders and over-the-counter (OTC) customers. 
Easypaisa mobile account holders can now move funds between any bank 
account and their Easypaisa mobile account, and OTC customers can walk into 
any of the Easypaisa shops and deposit cash directly into any bank account.
With 40,000 shops in more than 750 cities, Easypaisa makes access to formal 
financial services easier for Pakistan’s nearly 6 million unique Easypaisa account 
holders, as well as any OTC customers. For a country that has less than 13 percent 
of the population in the formal financial system,9 this is a significant step.
Tanzania: Industry-Led Interoperability
In Tanzania, use of mobile money is growing at a fast pace, as in Kenya (figure 5.3), 
with the regulator taking a test-and-learn approach. By enabling nonbank entities 
to offer payment services and working with the Tanzania Communications 
Regulatory Authority on the oversight framework, the Central Bank of Tanzania 
has shifted the regulatory approach to a mandate-and-monitor phase.
A key objective is to guide the market without stifling innovations or disrupt-
ing success, while balancing financial stability and consumer protection. Starting 
from a modest 1 percent adult use of mobile financial services in 2008, Tanzania 
experienced impressive growth to 90 percent access by 2013, with 43 percent 
active use among the adult population (di Castri and Gidvani 2014a).
Even more impressive is Tanzania’s recent development of interoperability. 
Working closely with the regulator, the industry experts from payment systems 
and mobile money services worked through frequent meetings, debates, negotia-
tions, and eventually consensus to successfully put together a set of standards 
that will govern how person-to-person (P2P) payments will be handled 
across  networks.10 The four main MNOs in the mobile money space (Airtel, 
Vodacom, Tigo, and Zantel) have come together with two of the largest banks

(CRDB Bank and National Microfinance Bank) as well as the Bank of Tanzania 
to craft a set of operational regulations for interoperability. Once the standards 
are adopted, a common technical switch can be operationalized, if desired.
According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC 2015), the Tanzanian 
mobile market is fairly evenly distributed among the larger three players, without 
undue market dominance of any one player (figure 5.4). Hence, there is a healthy 
competitive environment and broad customer awareness of mobile payments as 
a tested and proven service. For the process of establishing interoperability of 
mobile financial services, this meant that there was relative parity in negotiating 
power between market actors and greater value in interoperating for both cus-
tomers and providers because of the potential number of connections. Global 
Findex 2014 data show that the percentage of adults included had jumped from 
11 percent in 2011 to 40 percent in 2014, with 32 percent included through 
mobile accounts.11 If interoperability works as planned, Tanzanians will not only 
be able to send money through the network but also connect to banks as well.
In the meantime, Tigo and Vodacom signed the mobile money interoperability 
agreement in February 2015, thereby connecting M-Pesa and Tigo Pesa custom-
ers in Tanzania. Nearly 4 million Tigo Pesa customers and 7 million M-Pesa cus-
tomers will be able to transact with each other. The process is still ongoing, and 
it remains to be seen how much fruit this collaboration will bear. Another impor-
tant interconnect collaboration is happening between the East Africa region’s 
two biggest mobile money operators, Vodafone Group and MTN Group. This 
will enable convenient and affordable international remittances between M-Pesa 
customers in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Mozambique, and 
Tanzania and MTN Mobile Money customers in Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia. 
Hence, interoperability seems to be picking up in the Africa region.

Indonesia: Multi-Wallet Interoperability
Indonesia is the world’s fourth most populous country, with a population of 
around 245 million, over 60 percent of whom are of working age. Indonesia has 
the same archipelagic barriers to connectivity and access that Maldives and the 
Philippines have, but on a much larger scale. Indonesia has over 17,500 islands, 
of which over 6,000 are inhabited and around 1,000 are permanently settled. 
Driven largely by domestic demand, Indonesia’s economic growth is on an 
upward trajectory, and connectivity and financial access are becoming increas-
ingly important to Indonesians.
The Global Findex 2014 data show that only 36 of adult Indonesians have 
access to the formal financial sector;12 of those, 27 percent save at a financial insti-
tution, while 13 percent borrow. Given the country’s dispersed geographic struc-
ture, connectivity to formal financial institutions via traditional bank branch and 
ATM networks will always remain a problem. Although Indonesian mobile pene-
tration is comparable to its peers in the region, its banking services are relatively 
underdeveloped (figure 5.5). With mobile-phone penetration at over 100 percent, 
Indonesia is in the perfect position to use mobile money to enhance financial 
inclusion. Indonesia currently has six mobile money schemes.13
Regulatory Bottlenecks
Regulatory barriers have inhibited the growth of agent and branchless banking 
in  Indonesia. The central bank, Bank of Indonesia (BI), did not allow agency 
banking. Any person providing money transfer or cash withdrawal service needed

a money transfer license. Also, outsourcing of opening accounts or know-your-
customer (KYC) assessments was not allowed, and no concessions were made for 
the inherently low risk of low-value transactions.
Although regulations have been issued allowing nonbanks to offer e-money, 
until recently, any person wishing to start a money remittance or cash-out service 
had to obtain a license as a money remitter. This was not feasible for small busi-
nesses, which were discouraged from applying for licenses. As such, people in the 
outer islands and rural communities had severely limited opportunities to obtain 
financial services. To withdraw money from an e-wallet, a person has to go to an 
outlet managed by their own operator; with only around 25 outlets nationwide 
for each operator, mobile money was not a viable option in rural areas. Realizing 
the regulatory bottleneck, however, BI issued Fund Transfer Regulations in 2013, 
effectively paving the way for mobile money agents to offer cash-in/cash-out 
and account-opening services. As a result, thousands of agents started signing up 
(Camner 2013).
Industry Collaboration on Multi-Wallet Interoperability
Realizing that they have more to gain by working together and pooling resources 
than by competing with each other to cover the geographically challenging ter-
rain, discussions among three MNOs—Telkomsel, Indosat, and XL (Axiata)—led 
to the decision to interoperate. Recognizing the opportunity present in the pay-
ments market, these MNOs decided to interoperate yet keep their own identities 
by way of a multi-wallet interoperable arrangement.
On May 15, 2013, just six months after the discussions started, the ground-
breaking scheme was launched, allowing customers of the three MNOs to

transfer and cash out money from any location across each other’s network. 
Cash-ins are currently a cost for each mobile money deployment but may lead 
to other more lucrative businesses, such as bill paying, other payment services, 
banking, and so on.
Most important in this operation is the continuous dialogue among the 
members. They still need to iron out many issues, some of them industrywide, 
others system-specific. A primary concern is the protocol for customer grievance 
and redress. They have already decided to address each operation bilaterally, and 
end-of-the-day net settlement is to be done by the custodian bank in real time 
with the BI payment system. Managing Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting 
Funding of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations and training staff to perform KYC 
and customer due diligence (CDD) duties in a tiered fashion and moving toward 
risk-based supervision are other important aspects.
These measures are expected to lead customers to develop faith in the system 
and, over time, to transition toward e-money transactions. Anecdotal evidence 
suggests that many people still do not understand the value of mobile banking. 
A survey carried out by Financial Inclusion Insights (FII 2015) found that only 
around 3 percent of Indonesians were aware of the concept of mobile money, 
and those who were aware had heard of only one type of service (figure 5.6). 
Awareness raising is very important.
Figure 5.6  Mobile Money Awareness in Indonesia, 2014
Many Indonesians don’t have access to banks, but they do have access to mobile phones that could provide

Banks in Indonesia are fully interoperable and have established their payment 
and clearing services and ATMs. However, agent banking is yet to pick up. The 
majority of ATM transactions are actually payments, not cash withdrawals, indi-
cating that there is a demand for self-service electronic payments. Opening up 
interoperable services for MNO-led e-money is a smart early move, and MNOs 
have gained on the banks. By building consumer trust and awareness, they can 
secure this potentially untapped market. Either way, with a broader range of com-
petitive services to choose from, consumers will be the winners.
Agent Network Management in Kenya
You can buy a Coca-Cola anywhere in the world, but affordable products that 
provide essential value like water treatment or lighting often do not reach 
billions of poor populations around the globe. However, in what is commonly 
known as the “last mile distribution challenge,” some social entrepreneurs are 
providing innovative solutions to make the last mile a first opportunity.
—Nicolas Chevrollier and Stéphanie Schmidt, 
“Overcoming the Last Mile Challenge: Distributing Value to Billions”
The world’s best innovative solution or product could fail to achieve its objec-
tives if the last mile problem is not solved in a cost-effective manner. Making the 
final connection between consumers and the service or the product has often 
proven to be disproportionately expensive to solve, or sometimes may be forgot-
ten in the focus on technological and other important problems. Chevrollier and 
Schmidt (2014) sum up this reality:
A majority of the population in developing economies live in rural areas often 
accessible only by poor quality road infrastructure. Furthermore, geographical isola-
tion or limited access to relevant information disconnects populations in many 
developing countries from any business value chain. The consequence—which can 
affect both urban and rural populations—is that products providing essential value 
either do not reach the intended customers or are more expensive or lower quality 
than the standard products that are accessible by other populations.
These challenges hold for financial services as well. Comparing case study 
experiences of success in e-money deployments in some cases with inability to 
reach a seemingly feasible target in others, the manner in which the last mile 
problem is addressed is a critical element that often makes the difference. Even 
if all the key elements appear to be in place—progressive regulators pass enabling 
regulations, an innovative technology model exists that would be seamless in 
operation, and there is supporting physical infrastructure or connectivity—if the 
human element of the customer is not taken care of, the intended goal of wide-
spread, low-cost access to financial services by the poor may not be achieved.
According to the GSMA (2014), on average, there were 2.3 million mobile 
money agent outlets globally in developing countries in 2014 (figure 5.7). 
This is 4.3 times the average density of bank branches in these markets, which 

118	
Innovative Uses of Infrastructure and Digital Ecosystems
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
total 524,000. In three-quarters of the 89 markets where mobile money is avail-
able today, agent outlets outnumber bank branches. In 25 of those markets, 
there are more than 10 times as many mobile money outlets as bank branches.
The ability of the MNOs to reach the customer and their last mile advantage 
is undeniable, as they already have extensive touchpoints by way of airtime 
agents. Although that might bode well for the success of any MNO-led mobile 
money initiative, this is not necessarily the case. While the number of registered 
accounts highlights the growing ubiquity of mobile money, the number of active 
accounts is more important to understand the speed at which customers 
are adopting mobile money services. At the end of 2014, out of 255 live mobile 
money initiatives across 89 countries, 21 services had more than 1 million 
90-day active accounts, seven of which passed this threshold during 2014 
(GSMA 2014).
For any mobile money or digital financial service to reach the base of the pyra-
mid, therefore, building efficiency and quality into the agent network is a critical 
element in success. The agents perform registration, facilitate cash-in/cash-out, and 
also act as brand managers and awareness builders. Hence it is important that they 
are recruited wisely and trained on how to perform KYC and CDD duties, adhere 
to AML/CFT standards, manage liquidity, address consumer complaints, build 
awareness, and promote the service. Interpersonal skills are important, too: one 
main advantage of these last mile touchpoint agents often is that they are already 
well known in the area that they serve.

As mobile money initiatives grow in scale, the challenge of managing the 
network of agents is compounded, possibly stalling growth if not carefully struc-
tured. Examining M-Pesa’s agent network management offers crucial insights 
into how Safaricom (the mobile network operator that developed M-Pesa) 
recruits, trains, and manages its vast network of agents to reach high levels of 
efficiency.
Winning with Superior Agent Network Management
The dominance of M-Pesa in Kenya is partly due to the efficient management of 
its vast network of agents. Today M-Pesa has 26 million users (around 18 million 
active, as against 35 million deposit accounts in the entire banking sector), who 
transact through nearly 130,000 agents, with a deposit base of K Sh 1.8 billion 
and K Sh 7 million in loans issued monthly (CBK 2016; Maina 2017). The fact 
that M-Pesa has raised Kenya’s financial inclusion from 26 percent to 70 percent 
underscores the importance of the whole agent operation (Johnson 2012).
Agent Recruitment
Before the launch of M-Pesa, it was difficult to imagine the entrance of an MNO 
into the field of financial services. The existing network of dealers that Safaricom 
used to distribute airtime seemed the obvious choice to facilitate M-Pesa transac-
tions by providing cash-in/cash-out (CI/CO) services. An airtime dealer is an 
independent company, typically with 5–20 retail outlets, selling airtime, mobile 
phones, and other goods. These dealers quickly agreed to become M-Pesa agents 
because of their trust in the Safaricom brand. Agents have to register the customers 
by performing KYC/CDD checks, educate customers on available digital options, 
and perform CI/CO functions.
To support rapid growth, Safaricom initially had to ensure that enough agents 
were recruited to provide a viable service for users and, subsequently, balance 
the number of agents with the numbers of customers to ensure that agents had 
profitable businesses while customers did not face overcrowding and long wait-
ing times. The service was going to be successful only if a large network of agents 
and customers was quickly established. Despite some initial lag in the growth of 
agents relative to the growth of customers, engagement of agents picked up in 
2009 and brought the agent-customer ratio down from a peak of 1 to 1,000 in 
mid-2008 to about 1 to 600 by the end of 2009, and subsequently kept pace 
(figure 5.8) (Davidson and Leishman 2012; Jack and Suri 2014). If Safaricom 
had gotten the pace of scale-up wrong, M-Pesa could easily have failed.
In the early stages, Safaricom was able to use its reputation to bridge the gap 
in trust that is typical for new products and services. Agents trusted that Safaricom 
could launch a new profitable service, and consumers trusted Safaricom’s brand 
enough to experiment with the new system. Safaricom enjoys greater consumer 
confidence and trust than do many banks, and it is still Kenya’s most admired 
brand. To support the launch and growth of M-Pesa, Safaricom needed to build 
an ecosystem of actors. Each actor needed to be incentivized for Safaricom to 
grow M-Pesa without compromising the quality of customer service.

120	
Innovative Uses of Infrastructure and Digital Ecosystems
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
The roles and responsibilities of these different actors have necessarily evolved 
over the course of M-Pesa’s existence. That evolution has been pivotal to 
M-Pesa’s success as it grew from start-up (albeit with sound corporate backing) 
into a major provider. The roles and responsibilities of agents, aggregators, agent 
network managers (ANMs), and superagents are summarized in table 5.3 and 
detailed in table 5.4.
Incentive Structure
Since M-Pesa’s launch, agents have been incentivized to acquire customers for 
M-Pesa with a K Sh 40 (US$0.47) commission paid when they sign a customer and 
a further K Sh 40 when that customer makes his or her first deposit into an M-Pesa 
account. A staggered commission is also given to agents for each deposit that they 
receive and each withdrawal that they facilitate. It is free for customers to sign up 
and free to deposit, with charges levied on withdrawals and P2P payments.
Safaricom invested heavily in its agent channel. Commissions to agents to register 
4 million customers cost the company US$5 million (Mas and Morawczynski 2009).

Even agent aggregators are incentivized to support customer growth with a K Sh 10 
(US$0.12) commission for each new customer their agents sign (Omwansa and 
Sullivan 2012). Although the M-Pesa commission offered to agents is lower than 
that for airtime sales, M-Pesa still makes sense for agents.
The business case for agents has been important since the launch of the 
service. A Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) study of rural and 
urban M-Pesa agents 18 months after the launch of the service revealed some of 
the reasons to become an agent (Mas and Morawczynski 2009). The noncommis-
sion benefits include being associated with Kenya’s best-known brand and 
attracting increased foot traffic in shops. This was and remains particularly

important for rural agents, where M-Pesa brings cash into the villages; the cash is 
spent locally, usually in an agent’s shop.
M-Pesa generated nearly three times more revenue than mobile-phone airtime 
revenue for the typical agent. Average daily commissions for selling airtime were 
US$3.78 compared with average daily commissions of US$10.65 from M-Pesa 
transactions. (This had to be offset by the agent’s cost of travel to the nearest 
bank branch, which cost up to US$5, as well as lost revenue if the shop was 
closed during travel.)14
The business case for individual agent outlets depended on their costs of rent 
and wages (if it was not an owner-operated business), the return on their capital 
tied up in the M-Pesa float, and any losses to theft. At the average number of 
transactions, an M-Pesa agent needs US$1,341 to maintain his or her float and 
cash balances. The cost of capital may be a borrowing cost or an opportunity cost. 
Many aggregators strongly discourage borrowing to maintain working capital, 
because the additional expense undermines the profitability of the business. For 
the average agent, the largest proportion of costs is associated with rebalancing—
that is, management of liquidity between cash and e-float—estimated at US$1.13 
per daily transaction; although the introduction of more superagents may have 
lowered this cost over time. The average M-Pesa agent was profitable at 53 trans-
actions per day, but only if wages and rent were low.
Awareness Building
At the same time that it was incentivizing agents to promote the service, Safaricom 
invested in a massive advertising campaign with the simple proposition: “Send 
Money Home.” The advertising budget was spent in a big splash to support the rapid 
uptake of service. M-Pesa offered just three features: the ability to cash-in and cash-
out at agents’ locations; send money P2P; and buy airtime direct from Safaricom.
As M-Pesa began to take off, Safaricom had to invest in regular system 
upgrades. This massive investment can be seen in Safaricom’s financial results for 
fiscal year 2008, the first year of M-Pesa’s launch: capital expenditures were up 
by 41 percent, and sales and advertising were up by 92 percent. To execute this 
massive project, Safaricom had ensured buy-in from senior management, includ-
ing from the chief executive officer (CEO), and established a dedicated business 
unit to manage M-Pesa. It is estimated that Safaricom spent US$30 million over 
the first three years to launch M-Pesa (Omwansa and Sullivan 2012).
Agent Structure
MNOs such as Safaricom have a built-in advantage as mobile money service 
providers because of their experience in building and managing agent networks 
for the distribution of airtime. Safaricom’s approach to agent network manage-
ment grew from airtime distribution, but it evolved over time to ensure a consis-
tent customer experience and a viable business proposition for agents. As M-Pesa 
grew, Safaricom needed to constantly balance the number of agents with the 
number of customers; this was to ensure high enough commissions for agents 
without overcrowding outlets so much as to cause customer dissatisfaction.

The initial arrangement of players in the M-Pesa system is shown in figure 5.9, 
panel a. During this initial period Safaricom directly recruited M-Pesa agents from 
its pool of existing airtime dealers. These agents offered M-Pesa service through 
the outlets that they directly owned. In these early days, M-Pesa agents were 
required to have an outlet in at least three provinces; this was later relaxed to 
three outlets, and they could have subagents (figure 5.9, panel b). Safaricom 
maintained a direct contractual relationship with all agents at this time. Figure 5.9 
also shows the flows of cash and e-float between the various parties, a process 
described in the “Expanding E-float and Cash Management” subsection.
Outsourcing Agent Network Training and Management
In the first couple of years after launch, there was exponential growth of both 
agents and customers. Safaricom centrally controlled the agent network in the 
very early stages of M-Pesa, but the rapid growth in agents quickly led it to out-
source critical components of agent management. M-Pesa had 10 regional man-
agers across the country who were responsible for agent management. But with 
the massive expansion of the network, regional managers now primarily manage 
firms tasked with agent management.
These contracted ANMs helped Safaricom scale their agent network quickly, 
while continuing to provide high-quality, consistent service to customers. The 
first ANM that Safaricom recruited was a Kenyan marketing firm, Top Image, 
which was given the specific responsibility of training agents, distributing market-
ing and business material, and monitoring agents. Top Image also helped to design 
a training curriculum.
Training standards are defined by Safaricom and implemented by the ANMs. 
The ANM trains new M-Pesa agent staff on how to operate M-Pesa successfully 
and explains how to manage liquidity and how to comply with KYC and AML 
rules and requirements. Then a simple test is used by the ANM to determine 
whether prospective agents are ready to serve customers, in terms of both staff 
and outlet readiness. Top Image is responsible for the delivery of marketing and 
business materials to all M-Pesa outlets. Business tools include the agent tills,

transaction books, and registration books. They also distribute marketing and 
branding materials and make sure that these are properly displayed at all M-Pesa 
outlets, including M-Pesa tariff posters.
By 2011 Top Image was monitoring more than 80 percent of M-Pesa agents 
(23,000). At the time, Top Image had a team of 92 trade development representa-
tives across the country monitoring M-Pesa agents (250 agents per trade develop-
ment adviser). During fortnightly visits these representatives use a 10-point 
checklist to assess the agent outlet. Items that are checked include whether the 
outlet has enough cash and e-float and whether the logbooks are in good order. 
They also carry out “mystery shopper” checks on their KYC and AML procedures.
Safaricom now uses a number of ANMs in addition to Top Image to provide 
it with information about the M-Pesa agent network and its performance. Firms 
like Top Image are paid a fixed fee for their service, rather than being offered a 
commission split. This is to ensure that they independently monitor agent 
outlets, and that there is not a disincentive to report poor compliance—with 
Safaricom’s KYC and AML procedures, for example.
As businesspeople clamored to become M-Pesa agents, existing agents made 
informal arrangements with outlets that they did not own or operate (figure 5.10). 
While these subagent outlets were not owned by the original M-Pesa agent, they 
served to supplement the outlet distribution. Thus the roles of aggregator and sub-
agent evolved organically as an informal arrangement that had the tacit approval of 
Safaricom. Among the more than 10,000 M-Pesa agents, over 50 percent were 
subagents of aggregators. Agents acting as aggregators usually retain 20–30 percent 
of subagents’ commissions, but sometimes as much as 50 percent. There were a 
number of problems with subagents, who did not have a direct relationship with 
Safaricom, in particular inconsistent branding, inadequacy of float, and poor

knowledge of AML procedures. These challenges resulted in a further refinement 
of Safaricom’s agent network structure.
In late 2009 Safaricom began to reassert its control over the entire agent net-
work (Flaming, McKay, and Pickens 2011). The role of aggregator was officially 
recognized. Aggregator agents were tasked with an active role in subagent train-
ing and monitoring. At the same time, the maximum portion of commission that 
an aggregator could take from their subagents was capped at 20 percent. In addi-
tion, subagents were required to establish a direct contractual relationship with 
Safaricom. Given some of the complaints that subagents had about unscrupulous 
aggregators, Safaricom also mandated that a subagent could become an agent in 
their own right after three months with their aggregator.
Aggregators identify potential subagents according to their own criteria, such 
as outlet location, whether there is a large customer base, and whether the area 
is undersupplied by existing M-Pesa outlets. ANMs like Top Image then vet 
applicants and provide initial training. The incentive for aggregators is to recruit 
and manage agents who generate profits from high volumes of business. The 
economics differ between an aggregator’s own locations and those of a subagent. 
An aggregator location needs sufficient revenue to cover the cost of at least 
one full-time employee and rent, these costs being higher in urban areas than 
rural areas.
A CGAP study looked at the business case in 2011 when the average number 
of transactions per day for an agent outlet was 53 (Flaming, McKay, and Pickens 
2011). An aggregator’s own rural agent could generate profits of US$60 on 
53 transactions, but an urban aggregator agent could not generate profits until 
80–100 transactions had been carried out. The 20 percent commission share 
on subagents represents US$41 profit for an aggregator from subagents with 53 
transactions per day. The average aggregator with 100 agents is quite profitable, 
but this profitability rests on owning a large proportion of the agent outlets that 
they manage.
CGAP’s financial modeling shows that customer transaction fees provide the 
primary source of revenue within M-Pesa. M-Pesa retains 58 percent, aggregators 
take 8 percent, and agents receive 34 percent. In addition, Safaricom profits from 
airtime sales on the M-Pesa platform, at the same time making savings on airtime 
distribution. There are additional benefits to Safaricom from increased average 
revenue per user and reduced churn rates.
Expanding E-float and Cash Management
Agent recruitment is vital to M-Pesa, and so is the efficient running of their 
daily business: the management of their stocks of cash versus e-money (a 
relationship called “e-float”). Safaricom required K Sh 100,000 in working 
capital from prospective agents, and this was split 50-50 between e-float and 
cash. The typical urban-to-rural remittance pattern in Kenya means that an 
agent in an urban location generally has more deposits and hence a greater 
need for e-float, while a rural agent typically handles a larger number of with-
drawals and needs greater stocks of cash. If an agent runs out of e-float, he or 

126

she will not be able to accept any more cash deposits, and an agent who has 
run out of cash cannot process cash-outs. The management of liquidity is 
essential to ensure continuous customer service. Hence, Safaricom provides 
training on this essential activity. Agents manage liquidity by depositing cash 
in a bank account in exchange for e-float. This active management of liquidity 
is referred to as “rebalancing.”
Safaricom issues e-money to agents on a 1-to-1 ratio against the money 
held in the M-Pesa trust account; hence, no money is created. Since M-Pesa’s 
inception, the funds of all M-Pesa customers have been held separate from 
Safaricom in a trust account held by a prudentially regulated bank. The 
Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) held the first M-Pesa trust account. (CBA 
continues to hold an M-Pesa trust account, but the monies are now also split 
between three additional banks in Kenya to reduce risk.) In the early days, 
Safaricom was centrally issuing e-float to aggregators, who then distributed it 
to their subagents. The process did not appear to be well automated, as delays 
of two to four days in issuing e-float were regularly reported by agents. This 
tied up agents’ working capital and limited the volume of business that they 
could support.
To provide greater liquidity and much speedier rebalancing for agents, 
Safaricom introduced the “superagent” concept (figure 5.11). In May 2009, 
Safaricom unveiled its first M-Pesa superagent, Kenya Commercial Bank 
(KCB). Safaricom also made an agreement with KCB to provide collateral back-
ing for agents at favorable rates. KCB additionally provided overdraft protection

for agents’ working capital delivered through M-Pesa. Safaricom has continued 
to recruit banks as superagents to provide vital liquidity services to the agent 
network. Superagents deposit funds directly into an M-Pesa trust account and are 
issued with e-float by Safaricom, which they then sell to agents for a 1 percent 
commission. Although it is still possible for agents to buy e-float directly from 
Safaricom, in practice this is done infrequently. Banks, acting as superagents, pro-
vide agents with dedicated tellers in their branches and instant delivery of e-float 
after a cash deposit. Barclays Bank and Ecobank joined as superagents shortly 
after KCB, helping to formalize a new financial ecosystem of which banks are an 
essential part. (Superagents were then also able to offer bulk payment services to 
their corporate customers via M-Pesa.) Most agents rebalance their cash/e-float 
holdings daily with the help of the bank network.
Another tool to assist agents in e-float management is the management SIM, 
which enables aggregators to speedily credit e-float to subagents. Aggregators can 
use an online interface that allows for more streamlined and speedy e-float 
management. Subagents either deposit float with their aggregator or directly into 
the aggregator’s bank account. Through the management SIM, the aggregator is 
notified when a subagent has made a cash deposit at the bank, and hence they 
immediately release e-float. This eliminates the delay incurred when waiting for 
subagents to present teller deposit slips to the aggregator. The speed of rebalanc-
ing allows agents to be more flexible with their working capital; if they are in an 
urban area, where the predominant activity is taking deposits, they can hold 
more in e-float.
To summarize, Safaricom controls the business strategy for M-Pesa and sets 
the rules for the various actors. Safaricom defines the requirements for becoming 
an agent and manages the overall recruitment process, but it is the aggregators 
who select and manage these agents for vetting by the ANM and for approval 
by  Safaricom. Agent training and monitoring is outsourced to an ANM like 
Top Image. The agents are responsible for providing their own phone and start-
up capital. Banks act as superagents to rebalance agent e-float and cash levels 
on demand.
Because each market is different, it is hard to generalize the M-Pesa model and 
expect that a similar mobile deployment would necessarily thrive in another 
country environment. What is more important is to appreciate how M-Pesa 
understood the agent network as a critical enabler and evolved it dynamically to 
suit the market’s needs. The levels in the network were not predetermined but 
evolved to fill a gap or to formalize a practice that seemed to work. Safaricom 
was a dynamic, hands-on manager that realized early on that, left to its own 
devices, sooner or later the market would find a solution, and ensured that this 
took place within established boundaries.
Mobile Money Applications as the Digital Ecosystem
Many emerging markets lack the core infrastructure (national switches and 
settlement systems, connectivity, even electricity) required for innovative

payment systems to operate reliably. One option that addresses this pain-
point is Eseye’s innovative machine-to-machine (M2M) technology. By 
embedding SIM chips into solar-powered lighting units, Eseye has created a 
remote device management system enabling prepaid and pay-as-you-go 
(PAYG) financing via M-Pesa in East Africa. Prepaid customers buy 
exactly as much light as they need, while PAYG customers see their lights 
go out if they miss a payment. The payment options enabled by  Eseye’s 
technology and its relationship with M-Pesa circumvent infrastructure short-
comings in East Africa by operating through mobile channels. Without this 
technology, customers would have to pay up front or borrow in order to 
purchase the system. With it, many more people are gaining access to solar 
lighting.

Solutions—to Financial Inclusion through Payment Innovations”
Competition is increasing in many markets as mobile money becomes a main-
stream product for a growing number of operators. Two or more mobile money 
services operate in 56 markets, while 36 markets have three or more ser-
vices (map 5.1). In three markets—Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania—MNOs 
interconnected their services following the example of MNOs in Indonesia, 
where domestic interoperability was implemented in 2013 (GSMA 2014). 
Hence the question is no longer whether mobile money services are available, 
but how to ensure that the industry continues to grow sustainably.

Sustainability of mobile money services need not focus solely on providing the 
basic functions of CI/CO, bill payment, and money transfer. Moving along the 
value chain for an MNO starting from simple CI/CO to becoming a full-fledged 
banking agent is a possibility, depending upon the regulatory framework in a 
country (figure 5.12). The possibility of being a platform for the digital ecosys-
tem for millions of subscribers is an enticing prospect. Government payments, 
social grant programs, and payrolls are some of the services that could be deliv-
ered via mobile money platforms. In Kenya, applications (apps) have been 
designed by independent private sector developers. In partnership and by fee-
sharing agreements with Safaricom, M-Pesa has provided the infrastructural 
foundation upon which these value-added services have been built, thereby 
greatly extending M-Pesa’s digital connections and thus Kenya’s movement 
toward a cash-lite society.
Innovative Mobile Applications Enabling Movement toward a 
Cash-Lite Economy
Mobile payment–based e-money solutions can be operated even under trying 
geographical circumstances and locations. Unlike ATMs, point-of-sale (POS) 
operations, and Internet and telephone banking services, mobile e-wallet solu-
tions do not require broadband connectivity. Most modern-day mobile 
money solutions are operated using simple 2G phones—usually available at a 
cost of less than US$20 dollars per handset and thereby affordable to poor 
people. Because of the simplicity of the technology—requiring neither 
Internet service nor 3G or 4G connectivity—it is possible for MNOs to pro-
vide e-money services in faraway and outer islands and atolls in countries like 
Maldives and the Philippines.

M-Pesa was launched with an intentionally basic functionality, focused on 
CI/CO, P2P, and buying airtime. This provided a clear proposition that agents 
and customers could understand and adopt. Today, as figure 5.13 details, the 
functionality is significantly richer. As functionality was added, it opened 
opportunities for other businesses, particularly financial institutions, to use 
the system.
Table 5.5 shows the timeline of M-Pesa expansion of functionality and ser-
vices, and some of the most important enabling applications are summarized in 
subsequent pages. Since M-Pesa’s launch in 2007 Safaricom has continued to 
enrich the offer with additional services and features. This customer-centric 
approach has increased the utility of M-Pesa for more and more users. The key 
service enrichments (table 5.5) highlight those services that were introduced 
onto the platform following negotiations and agreement by private developers 
with Safaricom (some were not successful).
It is also useful to note that Safaricom has a financial incentive for the expan-
sion of the digital ecosystem that also well serves the customer, micro- and 
small businesses, and microfinance institutions (MFIs) as well as the economy. 
In this regard, commissions to M-Pesa agents are now the largest direct cost of 
running M-Pesa. Safaricom’s 2013 first-half results show that K Sh 5 billion 
(US$60 million) was paid out to M-Pesa agents, compared with voice and short 
message service (SMS) interconnect costs of K Sh 3.09 billion and airtime com-
missions of K Sh 4.65 billion.
Given the high cost of incentivizing agents to provide CI/CO services, 
Safaricom naturally wants to encourage M-Pesa users to spend their e-money 
within the ecosystem instead of cashing out. Developing M-Pesa’s financial eco-
system enables M-Pesa customers to perform more digital transactions, resulting 
in more transaction revenues for Safaricom, but also less agent commission pay-
ments for cash-out, and a further profitability boost. Building the M-Pesa ecosys-
tem to provide opportunities for more non-agent-based transactions increases 
the velocity of money on the platform.

Merchant Payments
M-Pesa was designed for individual use—which is fine if you are paying your taxi 
driver, as he just uses his personal account—but how do individual tellers in a shop 
reconcile M-Pesa with their till? Consumers in Kenya pay US$12.8 billion to other 
consumers (30 percent of their payments), but they pay US$29 billion to busi-
nesses (69 percent of their payments). The balance of US$0.3 billion (1 percent 
of payments) is paid to the government (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation 
2013). The greater opportunity is therefore in merchant acceptance.
At the end of 2010, Safaricom entered into its first merchant agreement, 
which would allow customers to pay with M-Pesa at the supermarket 
chains Naivas and Uchumi. By 2011, however, M-Pesa had only 100 individual 
stores signed up, and it took an innovative merchant acquirer, Kopo Kopo 

132

Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
(“transactions”), to convince Safaricom of the potential opportunity. A huge 
amount of money is circulating digitally through M-Pesa, but there was no easy 
way to use it to pay for things. Kopo Kopo managed to convince Safaricom to 
change its charging structure to launch a new service. Instead of customers 
paying tiered fees for transactions, merchant payments would be free for cus-
tomers, with the merchant paying a fee of 1.5 percent. Safaricom signed a 
merchant aggregator agreement with Kopo Kopo in March 2012. But Safaricom 
was not satisfied with an arrangement in which only Kopo Kopo acquired mer-
chants on their behalf. They also started aggressively recruiting merchants 
themselves, directly competing with Kopo Kopo and targeting 100,000 mer-
chants in the next six months.
Lipa na M-Pesa was launched in June 2013. Although Safaricom has a 
contractual relationship with Kopo Kopo, two months after launch Safaricom 
dropped the merchant fee to 1 percent without notice, which Kopo Kopo has 
matched. This 1 percent merchant fee to accept M-Pesa is significantly lower 
than the 2.5 percent typical for accepting payment cards. In addition, Safaricom 
has not shared its application programming interface (API) with Kopo Kopo, 
meaning that any changes on the M-Pesa platform can cause knock-on headaches 
for Kopo Kopo. Kopo Kopo has recruited 10,000 merchants onto its platform, 
about a third of the merchants on Lipa na M-Pesa. They are recruiting at a rate 
of 1,500 per month.
Kopo Kopo enables small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to accept, process, 
and manage mobile money payments. But, given that it is in direct competition 
with Safaricom, it has to do more. MasterCard statistics show that 90 percent of 
small businesses still track payments via pen and paper (Miller and Salazar 2013). 
Kopo Kopo’s platform offers a number of tools online or in a mobile app to help 
merchants track customers and transaction trends; they also offer real-time set-
tlement to bank accounts.
Following half-year results in 2013, Safaricom stated that it intended to continue 
growing M-Pesa by growing Lipa na M-Pesa and cashless distribution, e-commerce, 
transport payments, bank-to-M-Pesa linkages, and uptake of savings and loans pro­
ducts (Safaricom 2013). Safaricom’s plans for a near-field communication card 
management system may indicate its desire to move further still.
PesaPal is another company providing merchant services. Its focus is to enable 
merchants to accept mobile money, Visa, and MasterCard for online payments. 
Merchants are charged 2.7 percent of the value of transactions to access these 
payment channels. PesaPal payments also settle through a bank account, meaning 
that merchants do not have to be official partners with Safaricom, which settles to 
M-Pesa. PesaPal has been particularly successful helping schools to accept electronic 
payments. It is also investigating utilizing mobile point of sale (M-POS) to economi-
cally serve small merchants for card payments. PesaPal also offers individual users a 
PesaPal e-wallet. Users can top up their virtual wallets through PesaPoint ATMs, 
M-Pesa, Airtel Money, or yuCash and then make payments directly from it.
Another online and mobile payment platform is JamboPay, launched by tech 
firm Webtribe in 2009. JamboPay now has 700 businesses and over 100,000

users on its platform (Matinde 2013). The JamboPay service provides value to 
merchants by aggregating multiple payment channels such as M-Pesa, Airtel 
Money, yuCash, Orange Money, Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards, as 
well as direct bank account debiting and crediting. JamboPay was the 2013–14 
winner of the Google Innovation Award in the financial sector category.
One of the first service enhancements was the use of ATMs to provide M-Pesa 
account holders, who are not bank account holders, with 24-7 access to cash. This 
approach was pioneered in Kenya, but the relatively low stock of ATMs (fewer 
than 2,500) limited the extension of mobile money. This approach is much more 
interesting in countries with large numbers of ATMs—for example in Thailand, 
where more than 50,000 ATMs can be used for mobile money CI/CO (Pénicaud 
and Katakam 2014). Another service, the bill payment function, was designed as 
a way for customers to pay their utility bills directly from their phones without 
having the inconvenience of waiting in long lines. Kenya’s electricity utility was 
the first company to accept bill payment through M-Pesa.
M-Pesa’s huge customer base is larger than that of any bank or other financial 
sector organization in Kenya. As a result, after banks initially criticized the system 
and even lobbied the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to close it down, they started 
joining M-Pesa. Postbank was the first bank to join M-Pesa as an agent, just five 
months after launch. Today numerous banks and MFIs are linked to M-Pesa, 
enabling them to receive funds from customers through the bill-pay function, and 
smaller numbers of banks have a USSD link that integrates their customers’ 
accounts with M-Pesa, enabling their customers to move money to and from 
M-Pesa 24 hours a day (table 5.6).

ATM Transactions: Third-Party Providers
PayNet was the first company in the world to initiate cardless ATM transactions 
when its PesaPoint ATMs became cash-out locations for M-Pesa in July 2008. 
This provided M-Pesa users with 24-hour access to funds in their mobile money 
accounts. This is particularly interesting from a financial inclusion point of view 
because it not only increased the revenue for ATMs but also exposed cardless 
M-Pesa users to an important piece of mainstream payment infrastructure, 
increasing their knowledge and understanding of it.
PayNet is a financial services support company that is best known in Kenya 
for its PesaPoint-branded independent ATM network. PayNet started its indepen-
dent ATM network in 2005 in an effort to support interconnected services. It has 
180 PesaPoint-branded ATMs and 34 banks on its network, interconnecting 
800 ATMs. The company aims to interconnect as many financial institutions as 
possible. Its ATMs provide shared infrastructure for small- and medium-size 
banks and a backup network for the larger banks. PesaPoint charges just K Sh 30 
for ATM transactions.
PayNet also provides a debit and credit card processing center for banks, acts as 
a third-party issuer for Visa and MasterCard, and runs a POS-enabled agent net-
work selling mobile airtime. The company also offers a wage payment system 
called Wagepoint that issues closed-loop cards and places ATMs at employers’ sites.

This service is primarily used by employers of large numbers of unbanked workers, 
such as flower and tea farms, that have previously relied on time-consuming cash 
payment arrangements. Closed-loop cards are also made available to savings and 
credit cooperatives and MFIs.
Musoni Microfinance: Using M-Pesa as Its Core Banking System
Musoni (M for “mobile” and usoni meaning “future”) was established in 2009 to 
showcase how a cashless and paperless MFI could be transformative. Musoni uses 
electronic payments through mobile money for all loan repayments and dis-
bursements as well as deposits and withdrawals of savings.
One of the reasons that a pre-M-Pesa pilot with Faulu, a large Kenyan MFI, 
failed was because of the MFI’s concern that using mobile money for loan repay-
ment would undermine its group-lending methodology. Musoni, however, has 
managed to adopt the technology without undermining its group-lending 
methodology. Instead, it has used M-Pesa as its core banking system to reduce costs 
and increase the quality of service to customers. Musoni has effectively outsourced 
the expense of cash handling to M-Pesa. (Musoni estimates that approximately 
50 percent of resources in a typical MFI are consumed by cash handling.) The 
company’s branches have very low costs because they have no safes or security 
measures in place; branches are merely convergence points for purely administra-
tive purposes. Loan officers are much more efficient than in traditional settings, as 
they do not have to spend any time banking. Field branch offices are also paperless, 
having digitized all parts of the application process with the use of tablets.
Since Musoni issued its first loan in May 2010, it has disbursed 18,000 loans 
totaling K Sh 500 million (US$6 million). Musoni’s minimum loan size is US$58, 
and its average loan size is US$500. It currently serves 8,000 clients and handles 
50,000 transactions per month through its proprietary M-Pesa-based core bank-
ing system. The company’s loan book stands at US$3.5 million, with nonper-
forming loans at zero. It believes that the quality of its loan book is in part due to 
the financial discipline provided by using mobile money.
Musoni has a 100 percent repayment record because groups need to pay the 
day before their loan meeting. Group meetings are a maximum of one hour in 
length, and this time is used exclusively for training, including business manage-
ment, public hygiene, current affairs, and introduction of useful products and 
services, which helps to motivate attendance. Most repayments are after 5 p.m. 
and on Sunday, when people have time that does not impinge on their daily busi-
ness activities. Musoni’s solution allows the disbursement of loans within 24 hours 
of application directly to a borrower’s M-Pesa account. It also provides privacy in 
loan repayment while being supported by the group guarantee.
M-Shwari: Savings and Loans
M-Shwari is a bank account, available only through M-Pesa, that can be used for 
savings as well as a means to access microcredit. M-Shwari was launched in 
November 2012. It is a product of the partnership between Safaricom and 
CBA,  although most customers are unaware of the bank’s involvement.

Safaricom already had a long-standing relationship with CBA: as a corporate cli-
ent, CBA held the first M-Pesa trust account. (CBK still holds an M-Pesa trust 
account, but funds are now split among three banks.) CBA is a bank for corpo-
rate customers and high-net-worth individuals with a strong focus on technology. 
The success of M-Shwari has boosted its customer base from just 37,000 to 
5 million, the second largest bank customer base behind Equity Bank.
Since its launch, M-Shwari has reached nearly 9.2 million customers, with 
deposits of almost US$1.5 billion and loans of US$277.2 million (figure 5.14 
and table 5.7). The speed of uptake is remarkable, possibly indicating a large 
unserved market. M-Shwari loans are available in a real-time credit to an indi-
vidual’s M-Pesa account. To qualify for a loan, an applicant must have been an 
M-Pesa subscriber for at least six months, and then an algorithm based on their 
use of M-Pesa and airtime purchases is used to determine the initial loan limit.

This microloan product is serving the base of the pyramid with a minimum loan 
size of just K Sh 100 (US$1.15), a maximum loan size of K Sh 20,000 
(US$235), and an average loan size of K Sh 305 (US$3.50). Loans are for 
30  days and have a 7.5 percent fee. The majority of loans (70 percent) are 
repaid before the one-month due date. Backers suspect that this is an indication 
of the importance of this line of credit to individuals. Subsequent loan limits are 
based on the levels of regular savings with M-Shwari and customers’ repayment 
history on the initial loan.
These customers are below the threshold of most MFIs. M-Shwari is a very 
different product from a typical MFI loan, which takes a long time to obtain 
while a group is formed and savings are accumulated as security against a loan. 
In addition, this product provides a confidential service on an individual basis.
CBA spent two years in product development for M-Shwari, using data 
from the FinAccess Survey and receiving some assistance from Financial Sector 
Deepening (FSD) Kenya (FSD Kenya and CBK 2013). The survey showed that 
people believe savings should be free and held with a trusted person or institu-
tion. Focus group discussions revealed that individuals want their bank both close 
and far. M-Pesa, people said, made it too easy to access one’s money. They needed 
structure to help them with savings discipline, but they also wanted flexibility.
CBA uses the digital footprint that users develop through their use of M-Pesa 
and airtime purchases to prescore them for credit. This allows CBA to offer a truly 
unsecured loan. CBA then makes a real-time query of the National Population 
Register to verify identity. (CBA is the first nongovernment user of the database.) 
CBA is happy to remain in the background of this product, given the reputation 
of Safaricom versus the banks in Kenya. The aim was for the product to break 
even in a little under two years, but it broke even in just eight months.
Multi Media Mobile: An App that Facilitates International Remittances
Multi Media Mobile (MMMobile) is a software company that provides interop-
erability between the card and mobile money ecosystems by facilitating card-to-
M-Pesa transactions through an app on a user’s phone. The company believes 
that cards will form the predominant digital payment technology in the future. 
However, at the moment, mobile money predominates in Kenya. Hence the 
company’s approach is to build trust in cards through M-Pesa. The SMS and 
USSD platforms used by mobile money cannot support the level of security 
associated with card encryption, yet the public in Kenya trusts M-Pesa over cards.
The company’s initial target market is for international remitters, who link the 
card they want to use to the MMMobile app, allowing them to send money to 
any mobile money account in Kenya. They are also targeting tourists who want 
to buy from smaller merchants who do not have card acceptance devices; the 
MMMobile app allows them to still have the security of not carrying cash while 
allowing them to pay through mobile money, which is more readily accepted.
This innovation has the potential to trickle down to lower-income users. 
As with M-Pesa, lower-income individuals’ first experience of the system may be 
by receiving funds from a friend or family member. MMMobile again broadens

individuals’ remittance ecosystem to cardholders based anywhere in the world. It 
is particularly interesting to note that it is not a requirement to hold a bank 
account for either a sender or a recipient. A sender could transfer funds from their 
prepaid account to a mobile money account and in the future from card to card.
Additional Important Lifestyle Services for the Bottom of the Pyramid
M-Bima: Savings and Life Insurance. In 2011 the CIC Insurance Group, the third 
largest insurance company in Kenya, introduced a new technology platform 
called M-Bima (“mobile insurance” in Kiswahili) to strengthen the scale and effi-
ciency of its microinsurance operations. The platform allows customers to send 
their premiums via M-Pesa and Airtel Money, through the PayBill function. CIC 
does not charge its customers for transfers into the M-Bima account and even 
bears the Safaricom charges of K Sh 30 for each transfer.
The first product, launched in 2011 on the M-Bima platform, was the Jijenge 
Savings Plan. Clients can save as little as K Sh 20 (US$0.23) a day using M-Pesa 
or Airtel Money and receive SMS reminders to stimulate savings. The product 
provides clients with a convenient and safe way to build savings. It is a 12-year 
endowment plan with monthly installments of a minimum K Sh 600 (US$7) for 
a minimum coverage of K Sh 50,000 (US$580). The product combines savings 
with life insurance. Immediate coverage is provided for accidental death and, 
after three months, for natural death. An exit benefit is available at the end of the 
third year, with a surrender value of K Sh 20,000. Customers can cash out their 
savings from the third year but can also take the money as a loan from their own 
account. The target customers are those employed in the informal sector with 
low and erratic incomes. The product was developed with assistance from 
the  Microinsurance Innovation Facility, housed at the International Labour 
Organization’s Social Finance Programme.
Kilimo Salama Plus: Crop Insurance. In February 2011 UAP Insurance and the 
Syngenta Foundation extended their insurance product for smallholder farmers 
with Safaricom and M-Pesa. The low-cost mobile-phone payment and data system 
is linked to automated, solar-powered weather stations to issue an insurance pol-
icy and rapidly compensate farmers for investments in seeds, fertilizer, and other 
inputs that are lost to either drought or flood. Kilimo Salama (“safe farming”) is 
the largest agricultural insurance program in Africa and the first to use mobile-
phone technology to speed access and payouts to rural farmers. Farmers purchase 
Kilimo Salama Plus through local agrodealers, who use a camera phone to scan a 
special bar code that sends the policy to UAP over Safaricom’s mobile data net-
work. Premiums are collected at the store and sent via M-Pesa to UAP.
This index-based weather insurance relies on the data collected and relayed 
from 30 weather stations. When data from a particular station indicate rainfall is 
either 15 percent above or below historical averages and hence likely to signifi-
cantly reduce crop yields, all farmers with a policy registered with that station 
automatically receive payouts directly to their M-Pesa accounts at the end of 
the  growing season. Kilimo Salama is supported by the International Finance

Corporation, the Global Index Insurance Facility (which is supported by 
the European Commission), and Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture 
(Syngenta Foundation 2011).
Mbao Pension Scheme. The Mbao pension scheme targets the estimated 8.9 million 
informal workers in various sectors of the economy. At the press launch of the 
scheme in June 2011, the chairman of the Retirement Benefits Authority looked 
forward to a scenario in which beneficiaries were provided for in old age and funds 
were raised for investment in the Kenyan economy. Unfortunately, although con-
tributions may be received electronically, a physical application form must be 
collected from Mbao chapter offices, and pension payments currently have to 
be made by check. The scheme is gaining in popularity, and by the end of 2012 
membership stood at 40,000 (RBA 2013).
“Mbao” refers to the K Sh 20 note (US$0.23), which is the daily minimum 
contribution required by this individual pension plan. The Kenya National Jua 
Kali Cooperative Society developed this defined contribution scheme for the 
informal sector. The project started with a nine-month pilot project in which 
11,000 informal sector workers made contributions through the bill payment 
function on M-Pesa or Airtel Money. Any Kenyan over the age of 18 years is 
eligible to join this individual pension plan. To join, a membership fee of K Sh 
100 is paid, and a commitment is made to contribute at least K Sh 100 per week. 
The fund is run professionally with a conservative investment strategy focused 
on investment in money market and fixed income securities. The KCB acts as 
custodian, the Co-op Trust part of the Cooperative Bank invests the funds, and 
administration is by Eagle Africa Insurance Brokers.
Linda Jamii: Health Insurance. “Linda Jamii,” Swahili for “protect the family,” is a 
private medical care insurance that uses M-Pesa to collect premiums and to 
make benefit payouts. In November 2012 Changamka Microhealth and Britam 
Insurance Company launched the mechanism, which allows people to save small 
amounts of money over time toward purchasing health insurance. They started a 
pilot with Safaricom in May 2013 and have 2,000 households enrolled to date. 
Customers can save in a premium deposit facility on M-Pesa and purchase health 
insurance once they accumulate K Sh 6,000. They then have an additional six 
months to pay the outstanding K Sh 6,000.
Changamka’s strategies to address barriers to coverage include exclusive sav-
ings toward health care expenses, flexible timing of payments, affordable access 
to plans, and use of available mobile technology. In addition, the microinsurance 
program benefits health care providers, because the electronic operating plat-
form reduces the administrative burden on hospitals and clinics. The product 
targets the estimated 35 million uninsured in Kenya. Changamka plans to scale 
up this initiative nationally (Gathara 2013).
To subscribe to the service, users dial *525# and follow the directions. After 
subscription there is a requirement to complete the registration process by visit-
ing the nearest Linda Jamii agent outlet at Britam offices, Safaricom shops,

selected M-Pesa agents, Uchumi outlets, or Postbank branches countrywide. Once 
a person is registered, a unique Linda Jamii number is used to make payments 
through Safaricom’s PayBill function.
M-POS
The growth of alternative delivery channels to provide financial services has been 
called “branchless banking,” because it relies on the use of channels other than 
traditional bank branches. Using these alternative channels holds the prospect of 
extending access to financial services because of the potential for a dramatic 
reduction in the cost of provision.
In addition to mobile money, another exciting emerging technology is being 
used in Kenya: M-POS, a card reader attached to a smartphone creating a low-
cost POS center for use by smaller merchants. Because of its lower cost, it has 
the potential to massively increase card acceptance infrastructure and hence card 
use. (See figure 5.15 for a comparison of costs for various channels.)
Challenges to M-Pesa
Although M-Pesa is truly inspiring innovators in Kenya and globally to develop 
apps to provide services using the M-Pesa payment platform as the digital con-
nector, the biggest complaint from app developers is the reluctance of Safaricom 
to share the M-Pesa API with them. API is the technology that allows two soft-
ware programs to communicate with each other and allows any potential service 
developer to get linked directly to the mobile money account in M-Pesa instead 
of a bank account or credit card for payment.
With more than 12 million active accounts, it is no surprise why all devel-
opers want to have access to M-Pesa. Everyone in the application developer

community has been waiting for ages for Safaricom to release an M-Pesa API 
that would enable them to build innovative, value-added services on the 
M-Pesa platform or to link up already developed apps. In 2015, Safaricom took 
initial steps to open its API to the public to help developers build platforms 
that can use M-Pesa for quick payments. However, this promise has been there 
for some time, and the delay had led to independent development of open-
source M-Pesa APIs. However, “the systems are not yet in place to facilitate 
seamless integration into Safaricom’s platforms,” and opening up would entail 
technical, financial, risk management, and market implications for M-Pesa to 
consider (Morawczynski 2015). Nevertheless, opening up the M-Pesa API 
could be beneficial for the communities that otherwise do not get served.
Digitizing Social Grant Disbursement Programs: Brazil, Mexico, and 
South Africa
In a number of countries, two separate, but potentially complementary policy 
agendas have emerged in the past five years: governments have sought to 
increase the use of electronic means for government payments and to promote 
greater financial inclusion. While the two agendas have by no means converged 
yet, in practice they have often been translated into a single headline objective: 
to increase the proportion of recipients of government social cash transfers who 
receive payment directly into a bank account.
—Chris Bold, David Porteous, and Sarah Rotman, “Social Cash 
Transfers and Financial Inclusion: Evidence from Four Countries”
According to the 2014 United Nations E-government Survey, public administra-
tion can become more efficient and widely used through the use of recent digital 
developments, such as mobile apps and innovative financial instruments 
(UN 2014). The survey report identifies three types of e-government interactions: 
­government-to-government (G2G), government-to-business (G2B), and govern-
ment-​to-­consumers (G2C).15 This volume focuses on reaching the underserved 
through G2C (or, alternatively, G2P) methods.
National governments and the international community are increasingly 
recognizing the value of social transfers (including pensions, grants for families, 
public works schemes, and other programs) in achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals. In addition to their vital social contribution, social trans-
fers can support critical economic objectives. Many of the world’s fastest-
growing economies over the past several decades have built social protection 
programs into their policies at early stages because of their potential to increase 
productivity and help stabilize domestic demand (Samson, Mac Quene, and van 
Niekerk 2006).
Social grant payments are disbursed as cash payments in most developing 
countries. Barriers to transitioning such payments to digital systems include 
inadequacy of payment infrastructure outside of urban areas, absence of proper 
identification documents, lack of awareness and trust in payment options and

institutions, cost of transition, regulatory barriers, and lack of preparedness by 
governments for digitization. According to Findex 2014, whereas in high-income 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies 
a majority of those receiving transfer payments (83 percent) receive them into 
an account, in developing countries only about half of them reported receiving 
such payments into an account (figure 5.16).
In many developing economies, government grant disbursement programs are 
used to ensure opening up of bank accounts, thus enhancing financial inclusion. 
Findex 2014 reported that around 61 percent of grant recipient adults also use 
these accounts for cash management purposes. Four countries in particular—
Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and South Africa—use digital means in various forms 
to disburse grant payments on a scale that is significant in terms of financial 
inclusion. While all four use digitized payments, they adopted different methods 
(table 5.8).
The grant payment schemes from Brazil and Mexico are discussed briefly, 
highlighting the magnitude of these programs and the opportunities in terms of 
sheer numbers of people who can be brought into the mainstream financial 
system. However, because of the proximity issues of formal financial institutions, 
both programs still remain largely transaction- or cash-based. The South Africa 
case, on the other hand, highlights superior technology with important features 
that have supported financial inclusion in a more meaningful manner.

Brazil: Bolsa Família
From 2001 to 2003 Brazil created four cash transfer programs that were merged 
into the Bolsa Família program (BFP) in late 2003 and subsequently expanded. 
The new program seeks to invest in human capital by associating cash transfers 
with educational goals and uptake of health services (Paes-Sousa, Santos, and 
Miazaki 2011). BFP is the world’s largest conditional cash transfer program, 
reaching all 5,564 municipalities in the 27 states of Brazil. Over 12.9 million 
households are enrolled, benefiting over 60 million people (about 30 percent of 
the total population).
Bolsa Família owes much of its targeting success to Cadastro Único (CadÚnico), 
a single registry that has consolidated data on Brazil’s most vulnerable and 
has enabled Brazil to expand and improve its social welfare system.16 CadÚnico is 
managed by Caixa Economica Federal (Caixa), a state bank.17 Eligibilities are rede-
termined every two years. Local governments collect the data and the information,

a. In 2011, state communications agency Telecomm was still involved as a direct payment provider. But Oportunidades is in the process of 
consolidating its payments previously made through several agencies, including Telecomm, so that all payments would be made in 2012 through 
Bansefi, which then subcontracts with other networks, including Telecomm, to effect payout.
b. These cash payments into accounts are being phased out.

while the federal government, through the Ministry of Social Development, over-
sees the registry, defines eligibility requirements, and cross-checks data within the 
registry. Caixa plays a distinct role in implementing BFP by managing the database, 
assigning identification numbers, and finally distributing grants.
In terms of payment method, around 1 percent of the recipients receive cash, 
while 15 percent receive the grants through basic bank accounts held with Caixa. 
These are no-frills accounts, easier and faster to open by regulation, and offering 
four withdrawals free each month. Monthly balances are limited to R$2,000 
(US$575). A majority of the recipients, around 84 percent, get their grants using 
a limited-purpose card—the Social Card. This card is linked to a nontransactional 
account that requires withdrawal of the grant within 90 days in one transaction 
from the day of the deposit and does not allow other deposits. There is a nominal 
fee for the withdrawal. If money is not withdrawn, the grant recipient will lose 
that particular payment—the reason why the Findex 2014 Survey found that 
close to 88 percent of grant recipients withdraw all the money right away.
Caixa has a very effective network of payment agents of over 36,000 
points of service in all municipalities of the country, including 2,780 branches, 
24,756 retail agents, and 10,954 lottery outlets (CGAP 2011). A majority of the 
recipients (around 61 percent) withdraw money at lottery centers. Caixa is con-
ducting pilot studies on collecting biometrics, use of mobile phones and enhanc-
ing the touchpoints. Efficient administration and good targeting have enabled 
BFP to achieve its success at a very low cost.
Ten years after its inception, BFP has been key to helping Brazil cut its 
extreme poverty by more than half—from 9.7 percent of the population in 2003 
to 4.3 percent in 2013. Most impressive, and in contrast to other countries, 
income inequality also fell markedly, by 15 percent, to a Gini coefficient of 0.527 
(Wetzel 2013). Given the structure of the payment process, the Social Card 
remains a transactions card and not a savings mechanism for most grant 
recipients. However, efficient targeting by the CadÚnico registry, wide distribu-
tion of agent touchpoints, and effective management of the whole process have 
made BFP a powerful tool in fighting poverty.
Mexico: Oportunidades (Prospera)
The conditional cash transfer scheme in Mexico was originally founded in 1989 
and was rebranded twice before being renamed as Prospera in 2014.18 This was the 
first major social grant program in Latin America where grants were conditioned 
on activities such as school enrollments and getting regular health checkups. 
To date, this model has been replicated in as many as 52 countries. The program 
serviced around 5.8 million families, which is around 20 percent of the population 
in 2011, and in 2014 this increased to 6.1 million families.
The feeling in Mexico had been that Oportunidades was failing to make a 
meaningful long-term impact on the country’s social panorama, with atrocious 
levels of poverty and inequality refusing to budge over the years. This led the 
government to relaunch a widened program under the new name of Prospera, 
in  the hope that it would finally reverse a trend of stagnant and widespread

poverty across Latin America’s second biggest country in terms of the size of its 
population and economy (Constantine 2014).
Prospera is also promoting beneficiaries’ access to higher education and formal 
employment. Additionally, Prospera is facilitating access to financial services 
(savings, microcredit, and insurance), thereby enhancing social inclusion of 
the  country’s poorest citizens (World Bank 2014). The Social Development 
Secretariat (SEDESOL) is working to develop an integrated social information 
system to identify the poor, and it hopes to have a system similar to the Cadastro 
Único in Brazil.
The payments under Oportunidades were made bimonthly through the state-
owned development bank, Bansefi. However, 66 percent of payments were made 
in cash. The rest were distributed through Bansefi accounts: 16 percent through 
savings accounts with magnetic-stripe cards; 12 percent through Bansefi prepaid 
accounts operated through smart cards; and the remaining 6 percent through 
Bansefi passbook accounts. In 2012, the amount transferred to 6.5 million benefi-
ciaries was Mex$63.78 billion (US$3.9 billion). Given that most beneficiaries 
live in rural, hard-to-reach areas, SEDESOL has been continually trying out 
various new payment partners and options—Telecomm (the state telegraph 
company), gas stations, cooperatives, and Diconsa stores,19 to name a few.
In 2010 the government mandated SEDESOL to centralize the electronic 
payments of the grant program. As a result, all payments were outsourced to 
Bansefi, with Telecomm and Diconsa as subcontractors. Where banking infra-
structure is available, the beneficiaries are issued a no-fee open debit card to be 
used at any ATM or POS terminal,20 and the rest are issued a biometric closed 
debit card that can cash out only at Bansefi, Telecomm, or Diconsa touchpoints. 
Even though Diconsa stores have the physical outreach, the National Banking 
and Securities Commission approved fewer than 290 stores as banking agents. 
Hence this method, too, failed to gain traction. By 2012, only 20 percent went 
through open cards, with the rest paid in cash at either fixed points (20 percent) 
or at temporary points (61 percent) (Babatz 2013).
The lesson is that mandatory regulatory action alone will not bring about the 
desired results, unless backed by a well-designed strategic plan. Furthermore, 
­proximity to payment touchpoints is especially important in programs that serve 
the rural poor. Transaction cost is not the only thing poor people worry about; hid-
den opportunity costs of travel, loss of daily wages, or even the safety of carrying 
cash are all factored into the decision of choosing payment alternatives. The posi-
tive impacts of this conditional cash transfer program can be fully realized by 
addressing these issues, possibly through innovative use of digital solutions.
South Africa: Card-Based Biometric Grant Payment Disbursement System
Millions of South Africans lack access to the most basic financial tools. They don’t 
have secure places to save money or reliable means to transfer it and use it for 
transacting. Through the introduction of the SASSA Debit MasterCard card, 
nearly one fifth of the South African population now benefits from having a formal

banking product, helping them build a stronger future for themselves, their families 
and their communities.
—Ann Cairns, president of international markets, MasterCard, 
during award presentation to the South African Social Security 
Agency (SASSA), August 20, 2013
South Africa has seven major social security grant programs: Old Age, War Veteran’s, 
Disability, Grant in Aid, Child Support, Foster Child, and Care Dependency. 
Eligibility for each grant is dependent on an income-based means test. Administered 
by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA), the grants are financed 
through general tax revenues collected on a national basis. As of June 2015, there 
were 16.78 million grant recipients (about 31 percent of the total population). 
Over the five years from 2009–13, social grants were around 3.4 percent of the 
GDP, and this trend is expected to continue (National Treasury, South Africa 2013).
Social Grants and Financial Inclusion
South Africa is fairly financially inclusive, according to the Findex 2014 Survey: 
around 70 percent of the adults over 15 years of age have accounts in formal 
financial institutions.21 However, the share of adults who save and borrow 
(33 percent and 12 percent, respectively) leaves room for improvement.
The impact of social grants on financial inclusion is highlighted in the 
FinScope 2014 Survey (figure 5.17), which shows that 80 percent of the adult 
population is formally served (through either banks or formal nonbank institu-
tions) while 75 percent is banked. Another 6 percent is served by informal means, 
while 14 percent of the population is financially excluded. Financial inclusion 
grew from 17.7 million adults in 2004 to 31.4 million in 2014, and the adults 
who rely only on informal mechanisms have been reduced from 3.4 million in 
2004 to 2.1 million in 2014. In terms of gender, women are more likely to have 
bank accounts (79 percent) than men (70 percent) and less likely to be finan-
cially excluded (11 percent and 18 percent, respectively).
According to the FinScope Survey, the increase in financial inclusion is largely 
driven by the SASSA grants that are disbursed through a bank account–linked 
debit card. Accordingly, 34 percent of the banked population now owns a 
SASSA MasterCard. This is a remarkable achievement. Deeper examination 
reveals that it is not just the different types of social grants that made such inclu-
sion possible; the technology behind delivering grant payments to 16 million 
people has helped to bring them into the formal financial system.
SASSA Card: Biometric Chip Technology–Enabled Debit MasterCard
Until 2004, the grants had been allocated to provinces as block grants and disbursed 
mainly through private companies contracted for this purpose. In 2004, the 
National Treasury revised this practice and started disbursements through the 
Department of Social Development, and the payment options offered were cash at 
specific pay points or direct bank credits. Given the low banking access possibilities 
for the poor and the high cost of banking, in reality most grants were paid in cash.

In 2011, realizing the challenges by a variety of resource and logistical limita-
tions that made grant delivery vulnerable to widespread waste, fraud, and 
abuse, SASSA contracted Cash Paymaster Services (CPS, a subsidiary of Net 1/
Aplitec), in partnership with Grindrod Bank, to handle the grant disbursements. 
Grindrod Bank turned to MasterCard as its payment partner of choice. As the 
designated issuer, Grindrod Bank was able to hold deposits and, as a member of 
the Payments Association of South Africa, is able to clear through the National 
Payment System.

Note: In constructing these strands, the overlaps in financial product or services usage are removed. 
The figure reflects FinAccess 2014 Survey respondents who were ages 18 and older. The “Access Strand” 
is a graphical method (routinely used in FinScope Surveys) of placing each survey respondent along a 
continuum of access, depending on use of services by category. “Formal” refers to the share of the 
population using a bank, banklike institution, Postbank, or an insurance product. “Other formal (nonbank)” 
refers to the share using semiformal services from nonbank financial institutions (such as microfinance 
institutions), not bank services. “Informally served” refers to those using only informal financial service 
providers such as savings and credit associations and groups or individuals other than family and friends. 
“Not served” refers to those using no institutionalized financial services.

Net 1 and MasterCard collaborated on developing a unique MasterCard, 
integrating Net 1’s Universal Electronic Payment System (UEPS) biometric 
technology with MasterCard Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) chip 
technology22 to create a solution that successfully operated both online and 
offline,23 unlike traditional payment systems offered by major banking institu-
tions that require immediate access through a communications network to a 
centralized computer. This offline capability allows the user to conduct transac-
tions at any time with other cardholders in even the most remote areas, so long 
as a smart card reader, which is often portable and battery powered, is available. 
The card authenticates cardholder identity and authorizes spending using a single 
chip that can be instantly issued. The hybrid chip solution incorporates biometric 
identification and loading of funds with traditional spending and fund access 
functionality through e-wallets. Table 5.9 highlights the salient features of this 
unique and innovative card.
With the launch of the new card, SASSA also took the unprecedented 
difficult task of reregistering all the beneficiaries of the seven types of social 
grants. The new technology enabled the registration and instant issuance of a card 
in just under 10 minutes, thus saving registration and wait times for the grant 
beneficiaries. In peak times, around 150,000 cards per day were registered and 
issued. Since the card launch in March 2012, just under 22 million social grant

beneficiaries have reregistered in the new system. With 10–12 million SASSA 
cards issued, fraudulent grant applications have been minimized and administra-
tion costs reduced by distributing all grant payments electronically.24
As part of the SASSA reregistration process, each recipient has a bank account 
opened for them, which is offered free of monthly charges by Grindrod Bank. 
Recipients can deposit funds into their bank account via electronic funds transfer 
(EFT) or third-party bank transfer. The SASSA Debit MasterCard can be used 
anywhere MasterCard is accepted, and grant recipients can use it like a normal 
debit card to make purchases, check their account balances, and withdraw cash 
without incurring transaction charges at selected South African retailers. Recipients 
can also withdraw cash at any ATM, although normal banking charges apply.
According to Net 1, unlike a traditional credit or debit card where the opera-
tion of the account occurs on a centralized computer, each of the SASSA 
smart cards effectively operates as an individual bank account for all types of 
transactions. Although the SASSA card is a single-wallet system, it is possible 
to  enable multiple e-wallets on a single card, where each wallet can be tied 
to specific payment partners. For example, education grants could only be acti-
vated when used to pay school fees. This could potentially enhance cash 
management capabilities of the beneficiaries and ensure grants are used for the 
intended purpose.
Future of Grant Payments in South Africa
There is no question that using a unique biometric-enabled UEPS EMV SASSA 
card transformed the distribution of social security benefits in South Africa. 
The gains made by reregistration and incorporation of biometrics in the process 
are substantial. While creating a comprehensive national social grants database, 
it also helped to reduce waste, abuse, and fraud. Consolidating seven social pro-
grams and combining all payments under one card also brought in efficiency 
gains. According to the CEO of SASSA, the elimination of ghost accounts, dupli-
cations, and other irregularities resulted in over 650,000 accounts being removed 
from the grants register, thus creating annual savings of R 2 billion (US$157 
million) (SASSA 2013). An additional R 800 million (US$63 million) in service 
fees were saved in the 2012/13 financial year alone (Brand South Africa 2014). 
For the grant beneficiaries, absence of long lines at payment locations with 
scheduled payment times, reduction of personal security risks of carrying money, 
prevention of abuse and fraud, increased efficiency and safety, and availability 
of  free transactions and withdrawals are some of the important benefits that 
enhanced their value proposition.
Nevertheless, it must be mentioned that the SASSA operation is laden with 
controversies, court cases, and allegations against most stakeholders, including 
SASSA itself. However, this case study focuses only on the important technical 
solution offered. Digitizing manual payments is a difficult process, and digitizing 
seven grant programs and creating one innovative, easy-to-use, bank  account–
linked debit card is an impressive feat that significantly enhanced the value propo-
sition for the poorest and most vulnerable in terms of their financial inclusion.

Unique Identification
Introduction
Unique national identification (ID) is a critical component of a digital money 
system. The ability of the service provider to accurately identify its current and 
potential customers is central to providing digital-money services, such as mobile 
money or prepaid-card-based government grant programs. One important reason 
why M-Pesa was able to roll out the mobile money initiative so quickly—while 
also addressing the know-your-customer (KYC) concerns—is because Kenya has 
an established national ID system.
In Sri Lanka too, mobile network operators (MNOs) leveraged the existing 
national ID system put in place by the national government and the mandatory 
registration of subscriber identification module (SIM) cards when launching 
mobile money solutions. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka relaxed its KYC 
requirements, adopting a more proportionate approach to customer due dili-
gence (CDD) based on the e-wallet size. Similarly, Thailand’s biometric smart 
ID enabled wider reach in banking access, while in South Africa, biometrics 
were introduced to the social security system, to register or identify grant 
recipients.
The success of mobile money and scaling-up depends on speeding up account 
opening and minimizing steps in transacting. Overly strict requirements regard-
ing the identification and verification of customers tend to restrain the impact of 
efforts to increase financial inclusion. For example, strict application of CDD 
requirements may exclude people lacking official documentation from entering 
the regulated financial system. Strict CDD procedures may also lead financial 
institutions to pass on costs to the customer, resulting in a disincentive (especially 
for the poor) and thus may push them toward informal service providers. 
Although such measures may be appropriate risk mitigation measures for regu-
lated financial institutions, they may result in marginalization and exclusion of 
poor people from financial intermediary functions and payments mechanisms 
that enhance poor peoples’ coping capability.
In terms of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines as endorsed by the 
Bank for International Settlements (BIS), from an Anti-Money Laundering and

Combatting Funding of Terrorism (AML/CFT) perspective, small-value and 
low-risk mobile money transactions qualify for simplified CDD. Therefore, 
countries may consider applying “tiered” approaches whereby KYC and CDD 
requirements vary according to transaction or payment limits or wallet sizes. 
Higher limits entail a more extensive CDD process, including proactive 
account monitoring for suspicious activities. Since most potential mobile 
money users or grant recipients are either unbanked or underbanked, it is 
important to maintain minimum KYC requirements and allow simplified 
CDD processes to sign up for mobile money and digitally maintained grant 
programs, and to transfer or transact smaller values. At the entry level, a national 
ID document can be used to validate identity for KYC purposes. Sri Lankan 
mobile money operators use this tiered KYC/CDD approach and offer several 
types of accounts with different KYC requirements to ease registration require-
ments for low-income users.
In developing countries, civil registration systems are largely absent or cover 
only a fraction of the population. In developed countries, most people establish 
their official identity through an official birth certificate. However, a United 
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF 2013) report shows that births of nearly 
230 million children under five have never been registered—approximately 
one in three of all children under five around the world. UNICEF estimates 
that 35 percent of children worldwide, and 40 percent of children in develop-
ing countries, were not registered at birth. South Asia had the highest percent-
age of unregistered births (61 percent) in 2013, followed by Sub-Saharan 
Africa (56 percent) (Gelb and Clark 2013).
UNICEF maintains that having a birth registration is the first step toward 
realization of other rights throughout a person’s lifetime. Furthermore, the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that at least 10 million 
people across all regions are stateless (UNHCR 2017). Without official ID, these 
people formally do not exist. Gelb and Clark (2013) explain that this “identity 
gap” is increasingly recognized not only as a symptom of underdevelopment but 
also as a factor that makes development more difficult and less inclusive. 
They suggest that biometric ID systems could have a transformative impact on 
development, similar to microcredit and mobile phones in the far-reaching abil-
ity to improve poor people’s lives.
Biometrics take a variety of forms—iris scans, fingerprints, even face scans—and 
are being used to establish identities for many different purposes: elections, 
health care, payroll, government services, and more. Gelb and Clark (2013) 
conducted the first global survey of 160 cases where biometric ID has been 
used for economic, political, and social purposes in developing countries 
(map 6.1). The survey results show that some 1 billion people in developing 
countries across the world have taken part in biometric ID programs. 
Sub-Saharan Africa is the most active region (75 surveyed cases, covering an 
estimated 288 million people), while South Asia is third (27 surveyed cases, 
covering an estimated 426 million).1 Overall, at least half of these projects are 
donor-funded with official development assistance.

The cases are categorized as either (a) ID-supply-driven, or foundational, 
cases (such as establishing civil registries and national IDs); or (b) application-
demand-driven, or functional cases (such as demand for particular services or 
transactions such as voter IDs, bank cards, and health records). Under the func-
tional class, the general financial services category is an additional transactional 
type needing ID. In terms of projects or businesses that are implementing 
ID-facilitated financial services, Sub-Saharan Africa is in the lead with eight proj-
ects, followed by South Asia with three projects. Biometric authentication 
appears not to be widely used in mobile banking, although certain smartphones 
already have fingerprint scanners.2 While currently biometrics have not been 
popular in the developing-country mobile applications, they are available as a 
tool to expand use over time.
Biometrics are used more extensively in a wide variety of social transfers. 
The survey identifies 23 cases worldwide where biometrics have been used in 
creating beneficiary registries and authenticating cash or in-kind transfers at the 
point of service.
Biometric ID technology is one option for identity management and identifi-
cation that can help to leapfrog traditional paper-based identity systems in terms 
of proliferation, efficiency, and accuracy. It can extend current security and anti-
fraud efforts by preventing ready impersonation of the authorized user. At the 
same time, practical difficulties in implementing biometric ID cannot be 
ruled out, including the huge up-front cost of registering the users, privacy issues,

and social and cultural issues involved in getting people to consent to biometric 
ID methods. A further question is how well the data security and safeguard 
measures, and other operational aspects in using biometrics, would work in 
developing-country settings.
In the mobile money world, mandatory registration of prepaid SIM cards is 
viewed by governments and regulators as a counterterrorism measure enabling 
efficient KYC assessment, especially in developing countries. In the developed 
world where self-regulation is highly valued, privacy rights have discouraged 
such practices. As highlighted in the Groupe Speciale Mobile Association white 
paper (GSMA 2013), mandating SIM registration can have unintended negative 
consequences, such as loss of access to communications services when mobile 
users’ SIM cards are deactivated; restricted access due to possible geographic 
limitations on where SIM cards can be registered or purchased; and emergence 
of black markets for fraudulently registered or stolen SIM cards. However, estab-
lishing such a registry opens up more options for the users. Hence, it is up to the 
policy makers to harmonize the regulations with market needs after consulting 
with industry to analyze costs, benefits, and implementation options.
A national ID system provides not only verification of a person’s identity, but 
also addresses acceptable and approved basic KYC protocols for accessing 
finance and payment systems. The case studies analyzed in this chapter highlight 
why having a unique ID (UID) is a foundational and critically important enabler 
toward scaling up e-money initiatives while managing risks. The case studies 
focus on
•	 How lack of a UID can be a limitation in terms of scaling up digital finance for 
disaster relief programs and financial inclusion schemes;
•	 How transformative responses to the ID barrier enable millions of people to 
access financial services in a hassle-free manner; and
•	 How digital identity enhances customer experience in moving toward a cash-
lite society.
Not directly addressed in this volume are the political economy dimensions 
where vested interests actively hinder development, application, spread, and use 
of a unique identifier. By definition, a UID in any environment allows traceability 
by the tax authorities; enables AML/CFT compliance; and eliminates opportuni-
ties for leakages (fraudulent receipt of subsidies and social transfers), black 
market transactions, tax avoidance, and theft. Linkage of UID across financial 
sector databases and with phone and utility authorities promotes transparency 
and traceability, which are also challenges.
The Philippines: 21 IDs and Counting
If unbanked individuals lack appropriate forms of identification, which is not 
uncommon, they may struggle to participate in mobile money opportunities. 
This is prompting many governments to rethink the identity process and use

creative solutions that employ biometrics, for example, or that use group gather-
ings, where the identified identify the unidentified.

“10 Ways to Accelerate Mobile Money”
There is no unique national ID system in the Philippines. Various government 
departments collect personal information about every Filipino who has been 
issued a passport, a driver’s license, or a residence certificate. The government 
and businesses also obtain personal information for income tax payments, voter 
registration, marriage, public health insurance coverage, security clearance for job 
applications, and most business transactions.
The government initiated actions to establish a national ID system two 
decades ago, but various interest groups have thwarted implementation. During 
her term President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo issued an executive order for 
­government agencies and government-controlled corporations to harmonize 
their systems, and the unified multipurpose ID card (UMID) was established. 
However, this excluded nongovernment workers and average citizens, including 
those who are unemployed or working abroad. Proposals to issue every citizen a 
national ID card were vehemently opposed, principally on the perceived threat 
to security and violation of privacy by the government’s collection of personal 
information. At the same time, proponents argued that this could help fight 
criminal activities and cut down on corruption.
The Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, or BSP) has 
issued a circular identifying 21 different types of valid ID that can be used for 
financial transactions,3 and several other ID types are also accepted in the 
Philippines (table 6.1). The length of the list demonstrates how difficult the ID 
process would be for the customer and service provider, as well as for the 
­regulator, to provide and verify one or more of these forms of ID, whose authen-
ticity is often difficult to establish.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that providing a valid ID is still difficult for most 
of the poor, who tend to prefer informal financial service providers that use 
group or personal identification methods rather than subjecting themselves to 
KYC checks by regulated formal financial institutions. In rural areas, 558 rural 
and cooperative banks with a network of 2,101 branches provide basic interme-
diary functions. Poor people in the Philippines often use sari-sari shops4 or pawn-
shops for their financing needs. Many (25 percent) still use drivers and relatives 
for money transfer purposes.
Sari-sari stores are ubiquitous in the Philippines, numbering over a mil-
lion, nearly all of them owned by women. A demand study on domestic 
payment systems done by Bankable Frontier Associates (BFA 2010) revealed 
that pawnshops (such as LBC, ML, Cebuana Lh., and others) are well 
known, and more people use them for their payment needs than other ser-
vice providers (figure 6.1). In 2014, there were 5,971 pawnshops with a 
branch network of 11,542 shops in the country (BSP 2014). Even though

BSP was given the authority and responsibility to regulate pawnshops since

For service providers, too, lack of a universally accepted ID is a barrier when 
it comes to account opening and operating. With no universal national ID, the 
financial sector must rely on other forms of ID, which not all customers may 
have. The institutions have to manage their risk profiles while adhering to KYC

and CDD guidelines set out by the authorities. Additional training and capacity 
building will be needed to carry out an acceptable level of due diligence. 
Regulators can set risk-based measures such as limited transaction amounts and 
reporting thresholds to ensure financial access. Also, the agents will have to be 
given clear guidelines and training on performing KYC and CDD duties using 
acceptable ID documents. Again, anecdotal evidence shows that confusion 
remains widespread, making customers apprehensive about going to a formal 
financial institution.
UID is important in the provision of government welfare disbursements and 
disaster recovery management. Using a UID to verify identification and entitle-
ment, and making the payments accordingly, could address the leakage and inef-
ficiencies in some transfer programs based on cash. Coupled with switching to 
electronic payments, this could save the government a considerable amount of 
money that could be channeled back to the welfare schemes. The Philippines is 
one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. Hence, streamlining its 
disaster recovery program in terms of providing assistance is important for the 
country. In the aftermath of super typhoon Haiyan in 2013, the Philippines’ 
primary statistics office revived calls for a national ID system to speed up the 
process of identifying calamity victims—both the dead and the missing—and to 
offer financial assistance to the surviving victims.
The Philippines had begun to move a step closer to getting a UID card. The 
House endorsed Bill No. 5060 (the proposed Filipino Identification Act) for Senate

passage on May 20, 2015, which had been expected to greatly streamline govern-
ment transactions and promote more efficient service delivery. The proposed ID 
system would bring all existing government-initiated ID systems into a single 
integrated ID system. Once effectively implemented, the ID will provide proof of 
identity, status, age, and address for admission to all learning institutions, employ-
ment purposes, voting identification, transactions in banking and financial institu-
tions, and provision of benefits or privileges afforded by law to senior citizens.
The House of Representatives had also approved a bill requiring the registra-
tion of all prepaid mobile-phone SIM cards. If Bill 5231 had become law, it 
would cover tens of millions of existing and future prepaid mobile-phone users. 
At present, anyone can buy a prepaid SIM card and use it without filling out any 
form or being asked to present an identification card. Under the bill, as proposed, 
sale may be denied if the buyer does not present valid and clear proof of identity. 
In most countries SIM card registration with national ID is taken as the basic 
threshold in setting risk-based tiered systems for KYC and CDD purposes. As of 
May 2017, the Filipino Identification System (FilSys) had not yet been passed 
into law.
By beginning to seriously consider the UID issue, the Philippines is addressing 
one of the key conditions for mobile money proliferation. In a country already 
facing unique geographical barriers to financial access, enabling government 
­programs to go digital and mobile offers a crucial step toward financial inclusion. 
Steered by BSP as a forward-thinking and enabling regulator, the effort to lower 
these macro-level barriers should improve the ability of the unbanked population 
to access the mainstream financial sector in pursuit of economic opportunities.
India’s Aadhaar Program: Potential Game Changer in Digital 
Financial Inclusion
The largest and best-known biometric ID program in the world is India’s UID 
program, which provides a unique 12-digit identity number called “Aadhaar” to 
855 million people (around 68 percent of the country’s total population) as of 
May 2015 (figure 6.2).
In the year 2015 alone, 124 million people were admitted to the program at 
a rate of about 24 million new identifications each month. Uttar Pradesh has the 
highest number of registrations (118 million), followed by Maharashtra 
(93.5 million), and West Bengal (63 million) (figure 6.3).
Genderwise, out of the total number of Aadhaar registrations, 51.8 percent are 
male, while female coverage is 48.2 percent. Out of the total, 77.3 percent are 
age 18 and above (figure 6.4). These numbers are truly impressive and remark-
able, especially considering that signing up for Aadhaar ID is not mandatory. 
Aadhaar can affect financial inclusion and inclusive growth in a transformative 
manner by establishing links with bank accounts and facilitating a variety of ser-
vices targeted at the poor.
Since issuing the first Aadhaar number on September 29, 2010, in Maharashtra 
state, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) remained on track

to achieve its target of issuing Aadhaar numbers to 930 million individuals by 
the end of 2015. To reach such a massive scale, UIDAI used over 275 service 
providers chosen through a competitive process in line with procurement norms 
laid down by the government (figure 6.5). Both Indian and non-Indian organiza-
tions have contributed significantly to the proliferation of Aadhaar. In addition, 
by December 2011, UIDAI had true and tested statistics demonstrating system 
accuracy of 99.965 percent computed from an operational resident enrollment 
database of 84 million people (UIDAI 2012b).
UIDAI was established under the Planning Commission of India with a 
budget of Rs 123.98 billion (US$1.94 billion). By July 2013, Rs 30.62 billion 
had been spent on the project (Economic Times 2013). The National Institute 
of Public Finance and Policy conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the Aadhaar 
project over a 10-year period (2010–21) and concluded that the Aadhaar 
project has an internal rate of return in real terms of 52.9 percent to the gov-
ernment (NIPFP 2012).
Aadhaar offers a platform approach to financial services, especially financial 
inclusion (figure 6.6), by providing standardized services such as
•	 Electronic KYC platform for Aadhaar-enabled accounts;
•	 A payments mechanism to facilitate direct benefits transfer (DBT) by govern-
ment departments; and
•	 Standardized consumer experience through the Aadhaar Enabled Payment 
System (AEPS) and micro automated teller machines (ATMs).

AEPS allows Aadhaar cardholders to carry out financial transactions on a 
micro-ATM terminal (point of sale [POS]) at a business correspondent (BC).5 
The Aadhaar number, along with an individual’s mobile number and an elec-
tronic bank account number, can revolutionize the way people access and 
transact financial products and services. Aadhaar has the potential to become 
the universal linkage for disbursing government payments in a more secure, 
streamlined, efficient, and cost-effective way.
e-KYC and Aadhaar-Enabled Accounts
With Aadhaar, the banks can now authenticate customer details with the UIDAI. 
The UIDAI provides an e-KYC service through which the KYC process can be 
performed electronically with explicit authorization by the cardholder. As part 
of the e-KYC process, the cardholder authorizes UIDAI (through Aadhaar 
authentication using either biometrics or a one-time password) to provide their 
demographic data along with their photograph (digitally signed and encrypted) 
to service providers such as banks (UIDAI 2016). This process facilitates easy and 
quick account opening at banks.
The Aadhaar-linked e-KYC also provides a hassle-free approach for the mil-
lions of poor in India who do not have other ownership or identity documents. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in September 2013 approved the paperless 
electronic authentication (e-KYC) provided by the UIDAI as valid ID documen-
tation. Previously, in December 2012, the RBI allowed the use of the Aadhaar 
enrollment letter as a valid proof of identity and address (Rao 2013). These are 
important regulatory measures taken by the regulator to further financial 
inclusion.
Electronic opening of accounts at the time of Aadhaar enrollment is possible 
in partnership with banks through an electronic process. Aadhaar can also be 
linked to an existing bank account through any of the delivery channels—for 
example, branch, ATMs, Internet, mobile, and micro-ATMs. Any bank interested 
in using the facility must use UIDAI-approved biometric scanning devices and 
register with it to receive access to its data.
Direct Benefits Transfer
To facilitate DBT, bank accounts of the recipients can be linked with the 
Aadhaar number. This ensures that money under various developmental wel-
fare  schemes and subsidies reaches beneficiaries directly and without delay. 
The  scheme was launched in the country in January 2013 and has been 
rolled out in a phased manner, starting with 26 welfare schemes in 43 districts. 
This was extended to an additional 78 districts and three more schemes from 
July 1, 2013, and is to be extended to the entire country in a phased manner 
(Srikanth 2013).
The government also started transfer of a cash subsidy for domestic lique-
fied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders6 (used for energy and fuel purposes by 
households) to Aadhaar-linked bank accounts of the customers from June 1, 
2013, in 20 pilot districts. About 7.5 million recipients benefited in these districts.

Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
A modified scheme was relaunched in November 2014 in 54 districts covering 
23 million households, and will be phased into the balance of 622 districts in the 
rest of the country.
The scheme aims at halting diversion to other purposes of highly-subsidized 
LPG cylinders meant for domestic use. Over 153 million ­consumers across 
676 districts of the country will be covered. Currently over 65 million consumers 
have already joined the scheme and will continue to receive the subsidy through 
their bank accounts. Since the modified program was launched in November 
2014, an amount of Rs 6.24 billion has been transferred to over 2 million LPG 
consumers (MPNG 2014).
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 
(MGNREGA) is one of the flagship schemes of the Ministry of Rural 
Development (MoRD), which guarantees 100 days of wage employment in a 
financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do 
unskilled manual work. Since September 2013, MoRD has been actively work-
ing toward collecting Aadhaar data of its beneficiaries, entering the data into 
NREGASoft (software used by MGNREGA) and beneficiary bank accounts, 
and thereafter making payments through the Aadhaar Payment Bridge System. 
So far, providing the Aadhaar ID is optional. By October 2014, 20.7 million out 
of 105 million beneficiaries of MGNREGA had already linked their Aadhaar 
accounts to the program (MGNREGA 2014). According to news articles, 
Rs 150 billion will be disbursed annually to around 43 million MGNREGA 
beneficiaries (Mehra 2015).
Using the DBT facility, all types of social welfare schemes offered by dif-
ferent government departments can be streamlined and managed through a 
single Aadhaar-linked account, thus creating efficiency gains for the govern-
ment while reducing opportunity and accessibility cost to the recipients. 
An International Monetary Fund report (IMF 2013) states that the total 
savings from linking DBT to Aadhaar bank accounts could be substantial. 
The report highlights that leakages from outdated biographical information, 
“ghost” identifications, double registration, and other losses are estimated in 
the range of 15–20 percent of total spending. If the combination of direct 
cash transfer and Aadhaar eliminates the estimated 15 percent leakage cited 
above for the programs being integrated, savings could total 0.5 percent of 
gross domestic product (GDP), in addition to the gains from the better tar-
geting of spending on the poor.
Micropayments and the Aadhaar-Enabled Payment System
To enable payments from the Aadhaar-linked accounts, banks are issuing 
debit cards to beneficiaries. Banks have also started strengthening banking 
infrastructure, providing BCs in areas that were previously unserved, and 
introducing mobile banking solutions to ensure access and facilitate payments 
over a wide geographic area. The branch networks with ATMs, along with 
mobile banking systems and BC agents, ensure that banking services reach all 
the beneficiaries.

The cost of providing banking services to the poor, who transact in small 
amounts, is a limitation. Banks consider such “micropayments” unattractive 
because the transaction costs are relatively high. Aadhaar enables an efficient, 
cost-effective payment solution (AEPS) for promoting financial inclusion.
AEPS is a bank-led model that allows online interoperable financial inclusion 
transactions at POS (also called micro-ATMs) that are operated by a BC or BC 
subagent, appointed by banks using the Aadhaar authentication. Unlike an 
ATM, the cash-in/cash-out functions of the micro-ATM are performed by an 
operator, thus bringing down the cost of the device and the cost of servicing the 
customer. The micro-ATM supports deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and 
balance inquiries. Once successfully deployed, the AEPS payment mechanism 
will allow account access from anywhere through any delivery channel online in 
real time, thus enabling an efficient and cost-effective remittance transfer system 
within India. In addition, a variety of other services such as microcredit, micro-
insurance, and micropensions can be offered on top of this solution.
Though Aadhaar was a policy initiative by the previous government, it has 
received support from the present government. The Prime Minister’s Office 
(PMO) has directed the Planning Commission to collect data on Aadhaar and 
DBT schemes in 300 priority districts where Aadhaar enrollment is currently 
over 60–70 percent, as well as information on Aadhaar and DBT with respect to 
five key government schemes: MGNREGA, pensions, scholarships, Public 
Distribution System, and LPG (Tewari 2014). The Indian government subsidizes 
food, fuel, and fertilizers, with the total subsidy bill earmarked in the 2015 bud-
get at a massive Rs 2.5 trillion (around 2 percent of GDP). A significant portion 
of these funds is believed to be wasted because of improper targeting, middlemen, 
corruption, and duplication. Hence the Aadhaar-enabled DBT system could 
eventually address this massive leakage.
Issues and Setbacks with Aadhaar
Aadhaar is not without its critics among privacy and security advocates and ­others. 
Privacy and information security are very real concerns in a civil society, hence the 
need for open dialogue and providing assurance, especially given the way e-money 
in India is poised to take off with the introduction of Jan Dhan Yojana (JDY) 
accounts linked to the Aadhaar ID (as discussed further in chapter 4).
To address such concerns, a simplified form of security policy and standards 
should be introduced at inception so that service providers as well as users under-
stand the potential risks in digital finance and adhere to security guidelines and 
procedures. Given that the system is dedicated to the poor and underserved 
groups, a disruption could have far-reaching political, economic, and social con-
sequences. Other issues and concerns about Aadhaar are discussed in the next 
two subsections.
Aadhaar and the National Population Register
In addition to UIDAI and Aadhaar, the government of India initiated 
the National Population Register (NPR) in 2010, entailing the creation of a 

170	
Unique Identification
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
National Citizens Register, which is being prepared at the local, subdistrict, 
district, state, and national levels. The database will contain 13 categories of 
demographic information and 3 categories of biometric data collected from all 
residents ages five years and above. Collection of this information was initially 
supposed to take place during the house listing and housing census phase of 
Census 2011 from April to September 2010 (Hickok 2013). The NPR is legally 
enshrined in the provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship 
Rules 2003.
While it is not clear why two separate exercises are needed, the Planning 
Commission is of the view that it is necessary to speed up the collection of bio-
metric details of residents and issue them Aadhaar numbers as well as National 
Multi-purpose Identity Cards. The key differences between the two programs are 
shown in table 6.2.
Cost of Making Existing Infrastructure Aadhaar-Enabled
While the innovations have helped in generating the world’s cheapest ID cards 
under the UIDAI—costing around Rs 100 per person (Economic Times 2014)—the 
challenge will be deployment of Aadhaar-compliant biometric fingerprint POS 
devices (micro-ATMs) at hundreds of thousands of agents. This can be a costly 
and complex proposition, making it challenging for the system to be scaled up 
quickly in a cost-effective manner.
In addition, given the financial inclusion mandate, although the govern-
ment wants biometric authentication for credit card and ATM transactions, 
the market players are hesitant because of the costs they have to incur to 
upgrade each and every ATM and POS at thousands of merchant outlets. 
The RBI-constituted panel has estimated the cost of banks’ readiness for 
Aadhaar at around Rs 42.6 billion. It is interesting to note that, other than 
the cost, the stakeholders agree on most things, and one cannot rule out the 
potential internal demand that is being created by the government through 
this massive financial inclusion project.
The Indian economy predominantly uses cash, with cash in circulation in 
2013 at around 13 percent of GDP (more than double the global average) 
(Chakrabarty 2014). Studies have estimated that the cost of cash to the economy 
is significant (around 5–7 percent of GDP). This cost could be reduced by digi-
tizing payments.
Aadhaar has come a long way from its 2009 inception and is on track to 
deliver transformational outcomes to India’s poor. Financial inclusion is one such

application riding on the UIDAI’s infrastructure, since possession of an Aadhaar 
number enables opening of a bank account. Unlike a cash-in/cash-out e-wallet 
in an MNO-led mobile money solution, hundreds of millions of potential micro-
entrepreneurs who were outside the banking system are being brought into the 
credit economy.
Some critics maintain that UIDAI has no legal standing. However, the present 
government is placing considerable emphasis on its financial inclusion agenda 
and plans to accelerate DBT payments through JDY bank accounts linked to the 
Aadhaar number. Hence it is likely that the government may resolve this issue, 
perhaps through a legislative enactment conferring statutory authority to UIDAI.
Sri Lanka: Mobile Connect, the Interoperable ID
Mobile Connect is your new online identity. Simply by matching you to your 
mobile phone, Mobile Connect lets you log-in to websites and applications 
quickly without the need to remember passwords and usernames. It’s safe, 
secure and there’s no need to worry that your personal information will be 
shared without your permission.
—Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA), 
“Introducing Mobile Connect”
The importance of a UID for success in scaling up mobile money or digitized gov-
ernment benefit programs was discussed in the two case studies earlier in this 
chapter. Although in the real world, a person’s identity can be established and 
verified using identity cards and documents along with personal face-to-face 
verifications, in the digital world identity verification has to rely on digital identi-
ties. A digital identity is an online or networked identity adopted or claimed in 
cyberspace by an individual, organization, or electronic device. These users may 
also project more than one digital identity through multiple communities. In terms 
of digital identity management, key areas of concern are security and privacy.
Because digital identities created by individuals are inherently weak, and such 
identities are linked to online websites, e-mail addresses, or domains, security 
becomes a key consideration. The Mobile Connect Sri Lanka case study focused 
on how digital identity management allows consumers to move seamlessly from 
cash to cash-lite transactions through digital services. This is neither a costly 
operation nor meant only for expensive transactions. On the contrary, for average 
consumers, digital identity solutions such as Mobile Connect offer privacy pro-
tection, reduce the risk of identity theft, and simplify the login experience for a 
range of services, such as retail, health care, government, and banking, among 
others (Finextra 2014).
The Mobile Service Providers
In Sri Lanka, mobile penetration has grown steadily from 87 percent in 2011 to 
123 percent in 2016 (Harpur 2016). Sri Lanka also has the world’s lowest rates 

172	
Unique Identification
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
for fixed broadband Internet, around US$5 per month, resulting from a high 
level of competition among the suppliers and the government’s explicit aim to 
keep the cost to a minimum (ITU 2012).
There are currently five mobile operators in Sri Lanka. Dialog Axiata, the mar-
ket leader, and Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel have a combined market share of over 
65 percent, with around 9.5 million and 5 million customers, respectively. To date, 
the top four market players have all offered MNO-led mobile money services.
Mobile Connect
In February 2014, Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) announced 
the launch of a collaborative initiative, supported by leading mobile operators 
(including Axiata Group Berhad, China Mobile, China Telecom, Etisalat, 
KDDI, Ooredoo, Orange, Tata Teleservices, Telefónica, Telenor, Telstra, and 
VimpelCom), to develop an innovative, interoperable ID that would allow 
consumers to securely access a wide array of digital services using their 
mobile-phone account for authentication (GSMA 2014). The first interoper-
able beta trial of Mobile Connect was launched by Dialog and Mobitel com-
panies in Sri Lanka jointly in July 2014. WSO2, another Sri Lanka-based 
company, provided the Identity Server on OpenID Connect protocol, thereby 
providing broad interoperability across the mobile operators and online ser-
vice providers.
The result is the world’s first multioperator Mobile Connect solution that 
provides an out-of-band medium for authenticating a user to any service 
provider without requiring a password. The identity given under Mobile 
Connect is a form of a “validated” identity. The user’s credentials are always 
stored with the “home” entity (the “identity provider”). When the user logs 
into a service, instead of providing credentials to the service provider, the 
service provider trusts the identity provider to validate the credentials. 
So the user never provides credentials directly to anybody but the identity 
provider.
The User Case
The mobile operators usually have a subscriber base with their identities already 
verified. Since Sri Lanka has unique national ID cards and SIM card registration 
is mandatory, mobile operators already have the customers’ credentials. At the 
beta stage, popular online e-commerce sites and an insurance provider were 
linked to the system. The consumers were able to directly access the online sites 
via mobile phones.
The system provides two types of authentications: implicit, where the cus-
tomer is logged into the website seamlessly; or explicit, where the user is 
prompted to click OK. If the user is not on a mobile network (Wi-Fi access or 
on a computer or other devices), the user will then be prompted to enter the 
mobile number. However, this information is viewed only by the identity pro-
vider and not by the online service provider. In both instances the service pro-
vider only receives a verification of the credentials.

The customers enjoy a hassle-free, consistent experience across different 
online sites and never need to remember multiple usernames or passwords. 
Moreover, the identity information is protected, and customers can surf the web 
and make online purchases and payments without having to worry how their 
personal information will be used by the service providers. Although the beta 
trial was not considered statistically significant and the results were taken only as 
indicative, the beta users acknowledged satisfaction with the service provided by 
Mobile Connect (figure 6.7).
Future Pathways
In Sri Lanka Mobile Connect is now available as a service for the entire cus-
tomer base of both Dialog and Mobitel, totaling more than 15 million subscrib-
ers, and the companies are actively mobilizing service partners. Joint marketing 
and public awareness campaigns are ongoing. Dialog Axiata and Sri Lanka 
Telecom Mobitel won a special award at the European Identity Conference 
2015, for the Mobile Connect implementation with the WSO2 Identity Server 
(BusinessWire 2015.)
By 2015, the GSMA had already announced that 17 MNOs had launched the 
Mobile Connect service in 13 countries, with plans for additional launches 
and beta trials to follow. The GSMA’s Mobile Connect service enables customers 
to create and manage a universal identity that will securely authenticate them 
and allow them to safely access mobile and digital services such as e-commerce, 
banking, health, and digital entertainment as well as e-government portals via 
their mobile phones.
Because digital identity reduces the uncertainties inherent in transactions 
effected from a distance, using digital identity has huge potential for developing 
countries. Given the proliferation of mobile phones in developing countries, 
mobile identity can be used effectively in a variety of ways. There are different 
levels of security, from low-level website access to highly secure bank-grade 
authentication. This can be effectively used by government welfare schemes,

for remittance transactions, financial transactions, and other online e-commerce 
sites. Even for poor and older people who may find navigating the complex digi-
tal world challenging, having a digital identity through an identity provider 
would work more effectively than having to remember usernames, personal 
identification numbers (PINs), and passwords.
One very important issue to be addressed before scaling up this service is an 
evaluation of the e-identity laws and regulations in a country. Even Sri Lanka does 
not have such laws and regulations. Such regulations and guidelines would increase 
the effectiveness and transparency of public and private sectors’ electronic services 
by providing legal clarity in terms of security and data protection requirements, 
national supervisory mechanisms, and reinforced accountability and interoperability 
frameworks. Hence, developing countries should look at developing digital identity 
services in a holistic manner.

South Asia Digital 
Landscape, Future Options, 
and Conclusions
This study has examined how macro-, meso-, micro-, and customer-level actors 
can lead, engage, and influence the policies, regulations, processes, and ecosys-
tems to achieve greater financial inclusion through critical game-changing 
measures that foster innovative digital solutions. The experiences of the countries 
studied, both within and outside the South Asia region, have revealed many 
useful lessons that can be used as guiding principles to enhance financial inclu-
sion in South Asia and in the developing world as a whole.
Part III aims to distill the guiding principles and measures that would help 
avoid the deficiencies and pitfalls that have constrained the pace of scaling-up 
in several countries, and to suggest (in chapter 8) how they could be applied 
to help change the digital landscape in South Asia (summarized in chapter 7) 
as well as in developing countries more generally (chapter 9). Even though the 
game-changing elements discussed in this study, and digital finance per se, can-
not be considered a panacea for persistent financial exclusion problems, the 
lessons discussed here provide valuable options for policy makers and market 
players in addressing shortfalls in the use and reach of financial services.

Digital Landscape in South Asia
Introduction
South Asia consists of eight countries at different stages of economic development, 
with widely varying economic characteristics and attributes. With nearly 
40 percent of the developing world’s poor living in the region (World Bank 
2015) and 54 percent of the region’s adult population (585 million) financially 
excluded,1 addressing the financial inclusion gap is critically important.
Comparison of Findex data across the regions reveals that the South Asia region 
lags behind the East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America 
and the Caribbean regions in the percentage of adults with accounts, females with 
accounts, and the poorest 40 percent with accounts in formal financial institutions 
(table 7.1). On the other hand, the percentage of young adults (ages 15–24 years) 
with accounts in South Asia compares well with the other regions.
Even though the mobile account ownership indicator for South Asia is the 
second highest behind Sub-Saharan Africa, at 2.6 percent, considerable efforts 
are needed to push the mobile account ownership numbers closer to the 
11.5 percent achieved in Sub-Saharan Africa. South Asia shows limited owner-
ship and use of debit cards and credit cards (8.5 percent and 2.6 percent, 
respectively). Although automated teller machines (ATMs) seem to be the 
preferred method of cash withdrawal (31.1 percent), the region scores rela-
tively low on receipts of wages and government grants to accounts (3.5 percent 
and 3.1 percent, respectively) and utility bill payments using an account 
(2.7 percent). These gaps represent opportunities to use digital means to reach 
the poor and unbanked in a more meaningful manner.
Before examining the applicability of the lessons and guiding principles from 
the case study countries, it is important to diagnose the digital landscape and 
readiness of each country. Detailed country reports based on publicly available 
information and data gathered from different sources are summarized in 
an  “at-a-glance” matrix in chapter annex 7A, table 7A.1. This chapter also 
reviews the status of South Asian countries in terms of the key themes at differ-
ent levels of analysis, as a basis for applying the lessons of experience and guiding 
principles in chapter 8.

Macro-Level Strategies
At the macro level (of policy makers, regulators, and donors), a few of the South Asian 
countries have started aligning policies and strategies on financial inclusion as a 
national agenda. Lack of a clear national strategy—as well as changes in strategy 
when governments change—has resulted in inconsistent policies and discontinu-
ity of results-oriented programs. The region’s countries vary widely in their 
approaches, although several have made progress:
•	 India now has a clear direction and vision, and the country has embarked on a 
financial inclusion strategy focused heavily on digital financial inclusion 
modalities.
•	 Pakistan has not yet formulated a comprehensive digital agenda for financial 
inclusion, although its high-value payment system is digitized, and it report-
edly launched a national financial inclusion strategy in 2015.
•	 Sri Lanka does not have a national-level, comprehensive financial inclusion 
strategy, but the country has a clear information and communication technol-
ogy (ICT) and e-government policy, and the Central Bank has pursued use of 
digital finance for financial inclusion under its payment systems policy agenda.
•	 Bangladesh is also driving financial inclusion as part of its strategic plan, and it 
has a national ICT policy that promotes digitization.
Meanwhile, a comprehensive national policy or strategy on financial inclusion 
is absent in Afghanistan, Bhutan, Maldives, and Nepal, although efforts by their 
respective central banks to address financial inclusion issues can be observed in 
each country. More recently, the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), together 
with the Ministry of Finance and Treasury, has decided to use mobile network 
operator (MNO)-led mobile money as a short-term solution to address access to 
finance and financial inclusion issues in the outer islands and atolls. In Nepal, a 
large number of poverty alleviation–related programs have been initiated with 
the help of donor agencies, but there is no comprehensive program for the use 
of digital finance as a solution to address issues relating to financial inclusion. 
Post-earthquake Nepal is experiencing many new issues and may need to draw 
up a long-term strategy for this purpose. Afghanistan has a comprehensive wish 
list, but it still has to prioritize the main programs that would address financial 
inclusion issues. Bhutan is moving slowly with a declaration to support financial 
inclusion, but it has yet to implement a sustainable strategy.
Traditionally, South Asian central banks have been the driving force in 
financial sector development. However, lack of appropriate legal and regula-
tory structures has been a common problem of the e-money landscape in 
South Asia. Nonbanks have taken the lead in providing e-money services at an 
affordable cost to the poorer groups. The phenomenal growth in the use of 
mobile phones in South Asia means that MNOs have the capacity to surpass 
the traditional banking model in terms of facilitating access by the poor and 
unbanked to basic payment and financial services.

182	
Digital Landscape in South Asia
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
However, because MNOs are outside the ambit of the financial regulatory 
authorities, special dispensations are often necessary to permit these nonbanks 
and MNOs to enter the payment space to provide mobile-phone–based e-money 
solutions to the poor and the unbanked. India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka have 
enacted Payment and Settlement Laws. The other South Asian countries have no 
payment laws but have used the provisions in the central bank or the monetary 
authority Acts to issue relevant regulations for this purpose. Bangladesh has 
drafted a Payment Law, and Maldives has submitted a bill to the parliament. All 
countries have Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting Funding of Terrorism 
(AML/CFT) laws or regulations covering financial transactions, many of which 
are being reviewed.
Among the South Asian countries, Sri Lanka has the most comprehensive set 
of enabling laws and regulations for digital finance and facilitating nonbanks to 
enter into the payment space. It continues to adopt a flexible approach toward 
promoting nonbank entry, but within the applicable legal framework.
Meso-Level Approaches and Issues
A supportive infrastructural environment for e-money is important for digital 
finance to be successful as a means of enhancing financial inclusion. However, 
many South Asian countries continue with ad hoc, proprietary, stand-alone systems 
that do not necessarily provide a low-cost, affordable solution for the customers.
India has begun the process of making formal financial services available at 
affordable costs—for example, by mandating its banks to use a common applica-
tion programming interface (API) for mobile banking and ensuring that bank-led 
e-money projects are interoperable at all possible levels. The country’s biometric 
identification (ID) initiative, Aadhaar, is an exceptional measure India has intro-
duced to ensure that a unique ID is available to help mobile-phone users to open 
accounts and social grant recipients to access funds anywhere in the country. 
Financial infrastructure provision is well coordinated by the Reserve Bank of 
India, with support from the relevant ministries.
For its part, Sri Lanka has put key financial infrastructure in place, and systems 
are running well to ensure that services are available. However, coordination at 
the policy and regulatory levels needs improvement, in particular to address the 
passive role played by the national payments committee (NPC). LankaClear Pvt. 
Ltd., the retail payment infrastructure provider, is ready to move faster toward a 
fully interoperable Common Switch, but this requires tight coordination among 
stakeholders.
Bangladesh is still hesitant to allow MNOs to enter the payments arena, 
despite the problems encountered in the bank-led agent network. Maldives is a 
difficult geographical terrain for rolling out the necessary financial infrastructure, 
and the outer islands and atolls have no efficient and conveniently available 
access to payment and financial services. Therefore, a mobile money initiative is 
now under way in Maldives that will be low-cost relative to services from banks 
and other financial institutions.

Digital Landscape in South Asia	
183

Achieving full-scale financial inclusion is difficult in both Pakistan and 
Afghanistan because of ongoing security situations. Nevertheless, authorities are 
taking steps to deal with operational issues while promoting user-friendly digital 
products to enhance financial inclusion. Nepal has a private switch and a national 
common switch, but a comprehensive national strategy is needed to drive 
efficiency. Interoperable National Payment Switches (Common Switch) have 
been established in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, although not all banks have joined 
these national switches.
One unique feature about the South Asia region is that all eight countries are 
members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) 
Payment Council (SPC), established in 2008 to promote sound payment and 
settlement systems in the member countries. Digital finance as a means to 
address financial inclusion issues can be taken up by this regional body.
Agent network management is a concern for mobile money in most South 
Asian countries. Most MNO-led or bank-led but agent-managed initiatives are 
experiencing issues with respect to over-the-counter (OTC) transactions—that is, 
transactions that the agent conducts on behalf of a sender/recipient or both from 
either the sender’s or the agent’s mobile money account. These OTC transactions 
are often preferred by illiterate customers because they are apprehensive about 
effecting their own transactions using their mobile or prepaid cards. However, 
these agent-assisted transactions pose a number of issues including limiting the 
evolution of a digital cash-lite ecosystem; decreased provider profitability because 
of the high cost of monitoring; and unregistered transactions, which run the risk 
of money laundering and terrorism financing. 
In Sri Lanka OTC is not encouraged. In Bangladesh, the bKash system suffers 
from liquidity rebalancing and consumer protection issues, as customers often share 
their pin numbers with the agents. These issues require improved governance at the 
agent level, and financial education at the customer level.
India also suffered a long time with OTC-type transactions, but more recently 
has attempted to address some of the recurring issues. An MNO agent system is 
cheaper than the bank-led models’ agent system, and it is critical for MNO 
operations. Often, these agents are nondedicated to the mobile money ­operation, 
and they engage in many other ancillary services.
Micro-Level Models
South Asian countries are heavily bankcentric, and financial system development 
is usually driven through regulations. Although countries have recognized the 
financial inclusion gaps and tried to find solutions, most of them still favor bank-
led models over MNO-led mobile money solutions.
India passed legislation permitting “payment banks” and “small finance banks,” 
and deposit accounts in those entities are eligible for risk-proportionate know-
your-customer (KYC) procedures. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also amended 
the regulation enabling nonbank entities to be banking correspondents. This will 
enable nonbank entities, including mobile operators, and the national postal

service (with a larger network) to offer financial services by obtaining a banking 
license. However, these payment banks and small banks will be subjected to 
prudential regulations. Hence, the minimum capital requirement and other pru-
dential regulations will need to be addressed to facilitate scaling up to reach the 
masses. And in Bangladesh, bKash—a fully owned subsidiary of BRAC Bank with 
more than 80,000 agents—is the second largest mobile money company in the 
world in terms of the number of individual accounts.
Only Afghanistan and Sri Lanka have allowed MNOs to enter the payment 
space and offer MNO-led mobile money services. All others have stayed with the 
bank-led model or some variation of it, partly because of legal and regulatory 
issues. Although MNOs have the natural advantage of reaching rural people and 
the poor, as they already have their last mile touchpoints in place, South Asian 
policy makers and regulators generally remain hesitant to promote MNO-led 
mobile financial services. Nevertheless, Maldives is actively launching an MNO-
led mobile money solution.
Sri Lanka has the world’s first single-wallet, end-to-end interoperability 
among three MNOs. In terms of ATM interoperability, Bangladesh, India, 
Pakistan, and Sri Lanka have full or partial interoperability. Most signifi-
cant is India’s Aadhaar-enabled accounts that allow for interoperable 
transactions through any banking business correspondent of any bank 
using Aadhaar biometric verification and authentication. If successful, this 
would truly be a game changer for financial inclusion. Some forms of 
interoperability exist in Nepal (eSewa payment gateway) and Pakistan 
(between MNOs and banks).
South Asian countries have not used digital means to provide government 
salaries or social grants in an effective manner. Afghanistan used mobile money 
to send civil servant salaries, and India recently launched Aadhaar-enabled Jan 
Dhan Yojana bank accounts to channel direct benefit transfers and all government 
payments. Digitizing government-to-person payments has already started in 
India by depositing government pension and scholarship payments directly into 
bank accounts in some of the districts. Pakistan has also used National Database 
and Registration Authority (NADRA) prepaid biometric cards to disburse flood 
relief to victims, but it has yet to configure all grant disbursements to go through 
such a mechanism. All others use a combination of cash and savings accounts in 
microfinance institutions or commercial banks to disburse government benefits. 
There is a huge opportunity to streamline grant payments, government salaries, 
and pension payments.
Customer-Level ID Systems
The lack of a unique identity has been a continuing problem in the South Asia 
region, and these countries will need to introduce digital ID systems to enable 
the lower-income population to access formal financial institutions. India 
now has provided a long-term solution: the Unique Identification Authority 
of India (UIDAI)’s Aadhaar program is continuing the process of assigning ID

numbers to all citizens, having already issued 855 million IDs (68 percent of 
the population).
Afghanistan, Bhutan, Maldives, and Sri Lanka have unique IDs, and Sri Lanka 
is also planning to go for a biometric ID system that would solve many issues 
related to fake IDs submitted at the time of opening a bank or transactional 
accounts. Afghanistan came out with a digital ID (electronic-Tazkera) in 2015. 
Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal have multiple IDs, as does Pakistan—although 
it now offers a Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) by NADRA that 
verifies users’ biometric data. NADRA also does biometric verification when 
registering a new subscriber identification module (SIM) card.
Although all South Asian countries have data on grant recipients, India and 
Pakistan have developed biometric-enabled databases, which is a significant step 
forward. South Asia could learn from South Africa’s successful experience with 
a biometric ID system (as discussed in chapter 6), which has managed to avoid 
some of the KYC and customer due diligence and AML/CFT issues.

Opportunities, Challenges, and 
Future Options in South Asia
Broader adoption of digital payments—with regard to both remittances and other 
payments—can significantly advance the global financial inclusion agenda and 
support the priority areas of the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI). 
Not only are digital payments more efficient than cash payments, but their broader 
adoption also can reduce rates of corruption and violent crime, reduce the cost of 
government wage and social transfer payments, offer new pathways into the financial 
system for the disadvantaged, and, importantly, contribute to the ongoing objective of 
women’s economic empowerment.
—Leora Klapper and Dorothe Singer, 
“The Opportunities of Digitizing Payments”
Introduction
While the previous chapter’s summary of the digital landscape in South Asia 
cannot replace an in-depth diagnostic assessment of how best to digitize the 
delivery of financial services in each country, it provides a basis for applying 
the lessons and principles that emerged from the analysis provided in Part II. 
The  case study countries provided insight into how game-changing critical 
enablers can enhance the effectiveness of, or help overcome barriers to, digital 
financial interventions at the macro, meso, micro, and customer levels. South Asia 
region countries can benefit from strong actions by the key stakeholders to give 
priority to these critical enablers and provide the vision, direction, regulatory 
adaptations, and resources to ensure their effective implementation.
Macro Level
Leadership and National Policies
National-level policy commitment, progressive leadership, and consistency 
are  important enablers. It is an imperative for governments, policy makers, 

196	
Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Options in South Asia
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
and regulators to clearly announce the objectives of policies for financial inclu-
sion and e-money, as well as the specific areas of focus for defined time periods. 
Implementation authorities may simply ignore vague or unclear public policy 
statements or be stymied by changes in policy when the government changes. 
Countries should have a national policy for financial inclusion and a digital 
financial agenda (including information and communication technology [ICT] 
policy and e-government) to ensure that the strategy is implemented broadly 
to reach the unbanked and the underbanked.
Most South Asian countries have yet to develop these strategies. Among the 
case study countries, India’s Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana financial inclusion 
strategy is a clear example of how commitment to a major national strategy can 
drive significant efforts to bring poor people into the formal financial system and 
use digital mechanisms to reach them in a cost-effective manner.
Enabling Regulatory Environment
South Asian central bankers and regulatory authorities have always been at the 
helm of financial sector development, with a fair share of success. However, some 
still hold on to old definitions of intermediation and access as bank-only concepts. 
With most capital markets in South Asia at nascent stages of development, 
authorities’ understandable concern about financial sector stability pushes them 
to maintain the status quo. But rapid development of digital payments and other 
e-platforms have demonstrated that the approach to financial innovation and 
regulation needs to be recast if persistent poverty and financial exclusion are to 
be addressed more effectively.
Regulators in India and Sri Lanka (like those in Kenya) have started the process 
of establishing a more conducive and nonprohibitive policy, legal, and regulatory 
environment. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka proactively established the legal 
framework for nonbank institutions to enter the payment space long before the 
need arose, including legislation regarding payments, consumer protection, 
Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting Funding of Terrorism (AML/CFT), 
and electronic funds transfer.
By letting nonbanks into the payment space, the regulator establishes a level 
playing field in which competition fosters innovations that enhance the cus-
tomer’s value proposition. At the same time, the regulator can address various 
market developments and innovations in a more holistic manner. Sri Lanka has 
successfully maintained the delicate balance between establishing a level playing 
field among operators that encourages innovation while providing adequate 
risk-based oversight and supervision.
Nevertheless, South Asian countries should take precautions against the risk 
of cyberthreats when using digital finance for financial inclusion. Although the 
damage in terms of value may be small, cybercrimes can wipe out people’s sav-
ings and exacerbate the already limited confidence of poorer and more vulnera-
ble groups in the formal financial system. Hence the regulator’s role is critical to 
ensure that nonbanks as well as banks abide by prudential regulations and secu-
rity guidelines.

Meso Level
Financial Infrastructure Development
The widely dispersed poor population in many South Asian countries is a key 
challenge for establishing the infrastructure needed to expand financial inclusion. 
Connectivity, national switches, interoperability, and agent network management 
are critical components of digital finance models. Coordination among macro-level 
policy makers and regulators, meso-level institutions, and micro-level service 
providers is key.
National retail payment providers, ICT agencies, and credit information bureaus 
are some examples of meso institutions that can enable infrastructure 
development—yet these remain largely undeveloped in most South Asian countries. 
Since all eight South Asian countries are members of the South Asian Association 
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Payments Council, it should incorporate digi-
tal finance as a priority agenda for financial inclusion at the regional level.
Meso-level enablers are evident in several of the case study countries. 
In Thailand, the proactive Thai Bankers’ Association helps drive the policy that 
provides for the spread of ubiquitous automated teller machines (ATMs) through-
out the country. Sri Lanka’s ICTA (ICT agency) drives the e-government program, 
and LankaClear (retail infrastructure provider) promotes the corporate theme of 
“A World beyond Cash” in moving toward a fully interoperable common payment 
switch. The forward-thinking National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) 
facilitates strategic implementation of its dynamic inclusion policy.
Agent Network Management
The case that mobile network operators (MNOs) are best placed to offer 
mobile money is based on fast-growing mobile penetration among the poor 
and the unbanked population and their last mile coverage through ubiquitous 
agent networks that can act as mobile money touchpoints. Managing the agent 
network is a critical enabler for rapid mobile money deployment, through 
training in handling the customers, implementing know-your-customer (KYC) 
and customer due diligence (CDD) requirements, and addressing suspicious 
transactions.
Poor or unbanked people identify themselves more readily with local MNO 
agents than with formal bank outlets. South Asian countries have yet to 
develop such agent networks as effectively as in Kenya, where they facilitated 
the phenomenal growth of M-Pesa, which has now become the country’s 
national payments system and platform for many innovations that promote 
financial inclusion even among the poor in remote areas.
Micro Level
MNO-Led Mobile Money Model
Despite its clear advantages in terms of proximity and services to the targeted poor 
and unbanked population in hard-to-reach rural areas and islands, the MNO-led 

198	
Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Options in South Asia
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
model is still not popular in the South Asia region. Only Afghanistan and Sri Lanka 
operate full-fledged MNO-led mobile money solutions. Maldives has launched 
its own MNO-led mobile money solution. And Bangladesh has bKash, which is 
owned by BRAC Bank.
A recent Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) article (di Castri 
2013) concludes that regulators in a number of countries (including Colombia, 
Ghana, Guatemala, India, Nigeria, and South Africa) have been reluctant to 
grant MNOs mobile money licenses because they are (a) afraid that the MNOs 
could scale up very quickly and dominate the formal financial sector; (b) con-
cerned that regulators would be unable to control such growth and use it to 
deepen access to finance; and (c) nervous about the ability of MNOs to safeguard 
customers’ money as effectively as banks. But in many other markets, the regula-
tor has been able to design prudential regulations and market conduct frame-
works that help to make nonbank e-money providers sound and effective.
Interoperability
Interoperability is another important enabler for MNOs to enhance their out-
reach and efficiency. However, not many countries in South Asia (or elsewhere) 
have MNOs that interoperate. The best example is Sri Lanka, which launched 
the world’s first end-to-end interoperable mobile money solution: three MNOs 
operate a single wallet sharing merchants and agents, with firewalls built in so 
they cannot access others’ subscriber information. Indonesia represents another 
interoperability concept, with four MNOs interoperating but retaining four indi-
vidual wallets. Through such mechanisms, customers stand to benefit from lower 
cost as well as a larger number of touchpoints.
Mobile Applications
While there are around 265 live mobile money deployments in the world—with 
another 102 planned1—only M-Pesa has served as a basis for the development of 
significant value-added services by app developers who enjoy the benefits of 
low-cost, extensive outreach and convenience to customers. In Sri Lanka, the 
MNOs are taking small steps in the right direction by enabling government pen-
sion disbursements, tax payments, and international remittances. In some cities, 
near-field communications (NFC)–enabled, contactless smart cards can be topped 
up and used to pay the bus fare.
Card-Based Grant Disbursement Systems
Digitizing payment of government grants, salary payments, and all 
government-to-persons (G2P) operations (including pensions) is one of the 
most effective ways of getting poor people into the financial space. Digitizing 
these payments can address corruption, ghost accounts, leakages, and political 
intervention, as well as enhancing financial discipline in the delivery of gov-
ernment payments.
Brazil and Mexico have digitized government payments, while South Africa 
has started the process with a biometric-enabled unique identification (ID) system. 

Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Options in South Asia	
199
Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5	
However, with the exception of India’s Aadhaar-enabled government benefit 
transfer program, all other South Asian countries use cash, commercial or state 
banks, and microfinance institutions for grant disbursement. Digitizing these pay-
ments would significantly enhance efficiency and reduce leakages, as well as 
enhance financial inclusion of the beneficiaries.
Customer Level
Unique Identification
A unique ID is a key element in digital finance. It enables basic KYC subscriber 
identification module (SIM) registration and avoids paper-based, tardy AML/CFT 
and KYC and CDD processes that tend to exclude and discourage the unbanked 
poor. The plethora of documents required at the time of opening mobile or 
e-money accounts has put off the poor and pushed them to over-the-counter 
(OTC) transactions to avoid paper-based procedures. Bangladesh’s bKash system 
and Pakistan’s Telenor systems are experiencing OTC-related issues.
In the South Asia region, except for Bangladesh and Nepal, other countries 
have unique ID. Pakistan has the National Database and Registration Authority 
(NADRA)-issued Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC), and Afghanistan 
is planning to roll out the electronic Tazkera. India has Aadhaar ID, which is 
biometric-enabled and linked to bank accounts. In addition, Sri Lanka mobile 
subscribers have a Digital Connect online ID that can be used for authentication 
for online purchases.

Conclusions
Introduction
In the developing world as a whole, lack of money is the most commonly 
reported reason for being unbanked. Other reasons for not having access to 
formal financial services (through a bank, credit union, savings and credit coop-
erative, post office, or microfinance institution) include lack of proximity and the 
costs associated with maintaining an account. The wide accessibility of mobile-
phone and digital technologies offers the potential to reduce disparities by gen-
der and area (urban or rural).
Technology-based solutions offer a tremendous opportunity to transform 
the landscape of access to financial services for typically underserved groups, 
such as the poor, women, and remote populations. Digital or e-money can be 
enabled by mobile phones, branchless banking, point-of-sale (POS) transactions, 
prepaid or smart cards, and well-organized agent networks. These decentral-
ized modalities have the capacity to reach the unbanked masses in a safe, 
simple, reliable, convenient, and cost-effective manner, enabling them to 
manage small transactions, including personal and government payments as 
well as remittance transfers.
Greater financial inclusion means higher potential for the poor to participate 
and share in their country’s economic growth. Although the services avail-
able through e-money at present do not represent the full range of services avail-
able through financial institutions, they nevertheless enable those at the bottom 
of the pyramid to formally conduct certain basic financial transactions, and they 
can increasingly be linked to bank accounts and other means of accessing a more 
complete range of financial services.
This study has highlighted Kenya, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Thailand as 
countries where the private sector and nonbank entities have applied technology 
and innovative thinking to successfully address inclusion issues, supported by 
flexibly designed policies and regulations.
Kenya more than doubled the rate of financial inclusion in five years to reach 
nearly 70 percent of the adult population as a direct result of innovations

associated with the M-Pesa mobile money application, which has evolved 
into the country’s dominant retail payment platform. M-Pesa has especially ben-
efited the poor and unbanked, who previously had limited and costly access to 
traditional bank and financial infrastructure.
South Africa has issued some 10 million biometrically secure debit MasterCards 
as the platform for social transfer payments, thereby extending financial access to 
16 million poor beneficiaries, with the country’s banked and financially included 
population reaching 75 percent and 86 percent, respectively.
Sri Lanka’s government and central bank proactively developed the country’s 
legislative framework to support establishment of an excellent payment systems 
infrastructure, and possibly the best regulatory framework in the region to govern 
e-money for e-commerce and e-government. The result is the world’s first 
end-to-end interoperable mobile payment solution, reaching over 83 percent of 
the population.
Thailand’s efficient coordination of strategies and policies toward payment 
services and reduction of infrastructure costs—partly through the deployment of 
thousands of multicapacity automated teller machines (ATMs) and automated 
deposit machines (ADMs) throughout the country—has led to nearly 100 percent 
financial inclusion.
These findings, complemented by experiences from several other countries 
that are laying the foundations, reveal how e-money and other digital technologies 
can transform the financial inclusion landscape for the poor and underserved. 
This chapter summarizes the key lessons from the case study experiences that 
can be applied broadly to expand financial inclusion throughout the developing 
world.
Role of Governments and Regulators
While governments in principle have an interest in promoting financial inclusion 
as one instrument of poverty reduction and growth, their ability to take the 
lead may be constrained by lack of hard information on the results of new 
interventions, and their views may be influenced by powerful vested interests. 
Technologies that enable financial transactions to be conducted over mobile 
phones, POS, and other digital devices are disruptive to traditional financial 
systems because they bring in mobile network operators (MNOs) and other 
agents who are not licensed or regulated by the central bank authorities. Since 
the principal task of financial regulators is to minimize risks to the security and 
stability of the financial system, they are often understandably reluctant to 
introduce innovative technologies that might heighten such risks. Thus, the 
starting point is to document the roles that governments and regulators have 
played in promoting and facilitating the introduction and scaling-up of innova-
tive digital technologies for expanding access to financial transactions, as well 
as cases in which lack of needed action has stalled development.
Three key roles for governments and regulators are to set the legal and 
regulatory ground rules; establish a unique national identification (ID) system;

and incentivize or mobilize participation in digital payments, especially by using 
social welfare grant programs to drive demand and use.
A Conducive Legal and Regulatory Environment
Kenya’s M-Pesa mobile money application would not have occurred had the 
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) not been willing to give a no-objection letter to an 
experimental (and at the time, unproven) mobile money scheme in the interests 
of financial inclusion—despite some resistance from commercial banks and 
politicians. CBK then drew on experience with the scheme to eventually develop 
an appropriate legal and regulatory framework, which facilitated the entry of 
other nonbank players and their agents.
In Sri Lanka, the government and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) 
adopted a different but also proactive approach by early on enacting laws and 
regulations that created a level playing field, where both banks and nonbanks 
(including MNOs) could offer digital money. CBSL established distinct guide-
lines for an MNO-led model, as well as a bank-led model, opening up the field 
to a broader and growing range of providers with different value propositions. 
Leveling the playing field has the advantage of enabling private sector players 
such as MNOs to offer competitive products and services efficiently and at a 
lower cost. This policy approach has facilitated the launch of the world’s first 
end-to-end interoperable mobile payment solution.
The Philippines Ministry of Finance and Central Bank used a “test-learn-regulate” 
model—although success has been constrained by overly restrictive know-your-
customer (KYC) registration requirements and lack of clarity on the regulatory 
mandate regarding e-money, as well as the absence of a unique ID system. 
The Bank of Thailand likewise is seeking an appropriate balance between extend-
ing outreach, managing risks to the system, and protecting consumers. It has 
agreed to extend its supervisory and regulatory mandate to specialized financial 
institutions that offer extensive coverage in rural and poor communities that lack 
a commercial bank branch.
The conclusion is that the government and central bank must at least play a 
supporting role in establishing conducive conditions—and sometimes can play a 
lead, game-changing role—but that different approaches may be appropriate 
in different situations. A flexible approach to innovation can allow experimenta-
tion with new technology, leading to well-adapted laws and regulations based on 
experience. On the other hand, establishing clear rules that level the playing field 
for both financial institutions and MNOs to apply digital technologies can foster 
both competition and cooperation among private players to achieve the best 
value proposition for both providers and consumers.
A Unique National ID System
India’s unique ID program has enabled direct benefit transfer programs to be 
implemented through bank accounts. While not specifically linked to mobile 
technologies, this opens up the space for both MNOs and financial institutions 
to offer low-cost products to a huge, previously underserved market. In contrast, 

204

Bringing E-money to the Poor  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0462-5
the Philippines’ implementation difficulties were exacerbated by the lack of a 
national ID.
Incentivizing and Mobilizing Widespread Participation
India’s Jan Dhan Yojana (JDY) program demonstrates the transformative power 
of a highly publicized campaign plus incentives for people to open up bank 
accounts. This built on the unique ID system, which was critical to overcoming 
KYC challenges. Although the potential of the scheme is yet to be fully realized, 
it has opened up a huge opportunity for India’s low-income population to be at 
least nominally “banked,” making this market attractive for private providers of 
both financial and telecommunications services.
The government of Thailand has taken advantage of widespread, publicly sup-
ported specialized financial institutions such as agricultural cooperatives and the 
Village Fund to extend microcredit to the underserved population, especially in 
rural areas.
The lesson is that, with sufficient political will, governments can undertake 
direct actions that help transform the financial inclusion landscape. These include 
a unique ID system; incentives and promotional efforts to get people to sign up 
for bank, e-money, or other accounts that give them access to financial products; 
and expanding the network of touchpoints accessible to the rural poor.
Digitizing Social Grant Programs: A Game Changer
Brazil’s Bolsa Família program built on a merger of four cash grant schemes 
to become the world’s largest conditional cash transfer program, reaching 
about 30 percent of the population. A single national registry system, man-
aged by a state bank, regularly reviews eligibility, substituting for a unique ID. 
About 15 percent of beneficiaries obtain their grants through bank accounts 
that can be opened under simplified conditions and offer more flexibility 
than the “Social Cards.”
South Africa’s seven social security grant programs reach some 31 percent 
of the population. The South African Social Security Agency brought together 
a technology company, a bank, and MasterCard to develop a streamlined dis-
bursement and authentication methodology using biometric chip technology 
embedded on a card that can operate offline as well as online, making it suit-
able for use in battery-operated smart card readers in rural areas. The card is 
“open” and also allows its users to do other financial transactions using ATMs 
and POS technology in retail outlets—thereby directly enhancing the financial 
access of its 16 million users beyond just receiving grants. The system also 
yielded significant efficiency gains and savings by eliminating duplicate and 
ghost beneficiaries. The security of biometric and password protection is cited 
by beneficiaries as a tremendous benefit that prevents theft and fraud.
Similar efforts in Mexico to deliver benefits through a “closed” debit card 
proved less successful in terms of increasing financial access because of the 
failure to authorize a large enough number of agencies for cash withdrawal to 
make it sufficiently convenient to the beneficiaries. Unlike in South Africa, 

Conclusions	
205

the “closed-loop” Oportunidades card can only be used to receive a cash-out of 
the social grant benefit from a Bansefi Bank officer on a specified day and hour.
Because the bank accounts established in massive numbers under India’s JDY 
program are linked to the unique Aadhaar ID, they now offer an efficient vehicle 
for various state and national welfare schemes to deliver subsidies directly and 
quickly to the authenticated beneficiaries. In addition, the program presents an 
important potential market for the services of private mobile money and finan-
cial service providers.
The conclusion is that expansion of “e-government” to reach the bottom of 
the pyramid by utilizing digital technologies such as mobile apps, prepaid cards, 
and direct transfers into bank accounts can be a particularly effective way to 
incentivize adoption of these digital means. Besides cost-effectively extending 
financial inclusion, these technologies can also dramatically increase the admin-
istrative efficiency of identifying and targeting those eligible to receive social 
grants, thereby reducing leakages during the disbursement process.
Coordinated Action, Common Platforms, and Interoperability
Although laws and regulations are part of the macro environment, they are 
implemented by agencies that can be considered as meso-level institutions. 
Part of Sri Lanka’s success is attributable to close collaboration between 
CBSL and the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka. 
By coordinating proactively and converging the service delivery and customer 
protection paradigms of the telecommunications and banking sectors, the two 
regulatory authorities developed a comprehensive yet flexible mobile money 
regulatory and oversight framework. The National Payments Corporation of 
India has facilitated greater adoption of mobile banking by establishing a 
National Unified unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) Platform 
that allows every customer to access banking services with a single number 
across all banks—irrespective of the telecom service provider, mobile handset 
make, or the region.
Although interoperability is not a required precondition—Kenya’s M-Pesa 
succeeded without it, as a closed-loop proprietary system—it can facilitate 
greater competition as a spur to outreach and price reduction. Indeed, Kenya 
recently introduced regulations requiring interoperability with other pay-
ment systems, both national and international, leveling the playing field for 
other providers. In Thailand, interoperability has been successfully achieved 
through the National Interbank Transaction Management and Exchange 
Company, which supports all types of electronic payments and funds transfer 
from various channels including ATMs, counters, Internet, phone, and mobile 
channels, utilizing a secure and very efficient open platform. This develop-
ment was strongly supported by the Thai Bankers’ Association, which has 
proven to be a valuable meso-level organization that partners with the Bank 
of Thailand to further financial inclusion. Pakistan likewise has taken a step 
toward interoperability by linking its Easypaisa mobile money service with 

206	
Conclusions

the existing banking structure, enabling customers to transfer funds between 
a number of banks.
In conclusion, how regulations are implemented proves to be more important 
in facilitating or retarding development than how well they are drafted. E-money 
is unique in that it overlaps different regulatory domains, thus running the risk 
of a mismatch of regulations and how they are interpreted by different agencies. 
Hence it is essential to establish coordination mechanisms for the regulatory 
agencies governing both the financial and the telecommunications sectors. 
Also, establishing a payments platform that is common to all banks instead of 
each bank having to develop its own platform helps banks to focus on customers. 
Furthermore, measures to promote interoperability are potential game changers 
to hasten the spread of efficient, affordable mobile-phone and financial services 
to the previously underserved masses.
Outreach by Retail Institutions
In Sri Lanka, the MNOs responded positively and cooperatively to the 
favorable environment that had been established by the central bank, which 
enabled the MNO-led mobile money system to work with complete neutral-
ity across MNO mobile money providers. In an unprecedented move, the 
leading MNO, Dialog Axiata, invited the other MNOs to share its eZ Cash 
platform and set up a system for separate mobile wallets to be managed and 
interoperated on a common platform. The result is the first mobile money 
system in the world to be end-to-end interoperable across multiple service 
providers. The trustee bank arrangement protects consumer funds by 
ring-fencing the trust account and holding it in receivership in case both the 
MNO and the custodian bank fail.
In Indonesia, too, the three large MNOs decided to work together and pool 
resources rather than try to compete with each other to cover the geographically 
challenging terrain. Customers of the three MNOs can transfer and cash out 
money from any location across each other’s network. In this case, however, they 
decided to keep their own identities by way of a multi-wallet interoperable 
arrangement.
The success of M-Pesa was due in large part to Safaricom already having an 
extensive network of agents selling airtime and their effective management of 
the recruitment and training of agents needed to support rapid scaling-up. A dif-
ferent approach was taken by the government of India, which decided to set up 
special payment banks and small finance banks in unbanked and underbanked 
regions. It remains to be seen whether this approach can be sufficiently 
cost-effective to compete with other payment mechanisms and thereby draw 
more of the population into these banks.
A key conclusion is that increasing accessibility of mobile money and finan-
cial services depends on the efforts of the retail institutions—banks and other 
financial institutions as well as MNOs—to develop and deliver affordable services 
that meet the needs of the previously unserved or underserved population. 

Conclusions

Experience shows that private providers can work cooperatively to make com-
mon elements of the system work cost-effectively while competing for custom-
ers on the retail end, when the infrastructure and incentives have been 
established to level the playing field and provide neutrality across providers. 
Hence it is incumbent on governments and central banks to lay the regulatory 
and infrastructural foundation for private actors to do so profitably and to 
facilitate market forces to drive the players toward the desired results.
Agents represent a further key element in utilizing e-money to extend the 
outreach of financial services, given that the number of mobile money agents is 
typically 4 to 10 times the number of bank branches. However, managing agent 
networks requires a delicate balance between ensuring the profitability of each 
agent and providing enough touchpoints that consumers can be served quickly 
and efficiently.
Increasing Accessibility for Customers
Thailand’s use of retail stores has been a major factor in the rapid expansion 
of mobile money by bringing services close to the customer. For example, at 
every 7-Eleven store, which are widely distributed throughout remote rural 
areas as well as in the city, one can send and retrieve money, pay utility bills, 
purchase an airline ticket, or make a bank deposit. Kenya has had some suc-
cess with adapting the mobile-phone platform to facilitate microfinance 
programs and various forms of insurance (life, accident, health, and crop), 
as well as pensions for informal workers. Mobile POS devices offer the 
potential to greatly expand access to financial services through branchless 
banking.
On the other hand, countries that have rigidly applied KYC and customer due 
diligence (CDD) requirements at the bottom of the pyramid have tended to have 
disappointing rates of enrollment. More successful have been countries such as 
Sri Lanka that have adopted a tiered approach, with much lighter requirements for 
accounts with restricted uses and low-value transactions. Sri Lanka has also dealt 
with concerns about the security of information by establishing the world’s first 
multioperator Mobile Connect solution that provides an independent means for 
authenticating a user to any service provider without requiring a password.
An important conclusion from the customer point of view is that the direct 
cost of transactions is only one among several determinants of the value proposi-
tion of a mobile money or financial service. Proximity and convenience are often 
overriding concerns. Simplicity and ease of registration are also important. 
Although not yet a major concern to the low-end consumers, the security and 
possible misuse of the information provided represents an important risk to 
systems targeting millions of new customers—a risk that needs to be addressed 
in moving toward a cash-lite economic ecosystem. Overall, the linkage of mobile 
technologies with financial services offers many opportunities to improve the 
customer experience and provide more (or more efficient) services through new 
applications.

The Journey toward a Cash-Lite Society: Coordination and Balance
Two key steps toward a cash-lite, financially inclusive system are digitizing the 
payments and digitizing the money. The implied strategic question is whether to 
begin by democratizing bank accounts through massive enrollment, or by making 
e-money readily accessible over mobile-phone technology. In the countries stud-
ied, both bank-led and MNO-led models have been effective; either can create 
conditions that facilitate expansion of the other. Whether the potential is then 
realized depends heavily on other conditions, such as the existence of a unique 
national ID and the regulations governing who can do what and how banks and 
MNOs can link up (or compete).
Although governments and regulators clearly play a key role in the successful 
expansion of financial inclusion by leveraging digital technologies, again, no single 
strategic approach emerges: much depends on country circumstances. In Kenya, 
regulatory flexibility to permit experimentation with mobile-phone technology 
was the leading edge. In India, government incentives and the campaign for 
opening bank accounts is the leading game changer, with establishment of a 
unique national ID system as a fundamental precondition.
No matter how conducive the framework, the success of efforts to promote 
financial inclusion ultimately depends on the readiness of the previously 
unserved or underserved population to participate. Experiences in the countries 
studied show that cost and convenience are the most critical factors. The key 
challenge that digital technologies are helping to address is to make small transac-
tions feasible at prices that are both affordable to the users and profitable to the 
suppliers. The equally critical factor of proximity to the client is being success-
fully addressed in some countries through low-cost options for the banking 
system to reach out, such as agent banking and POS devices, and in others by 
making financial “wallets” available through mobile phones, which already have 
high penetration. Other factors affecting the value proposition to consumers 
include the increased safety of going cashless, security of information, simplic-
ity  (including formats readily accessible to the nonliterate population), and 
reliability.
Where to begin or to target interventions depends very much on the country 
context and the existing state of laws and regulations governing mobile money 
and banking, the extent of penetration of bank accounts and mobile telephony, 
the existence of national ID, and cultural and other factors. It also depends on 
which technologies and innovations may be available at any given time to address 
the needs of the targeted population and the challenges facing implementation. 
So, each country that wishes to use the potential of e-money technologies to 
advance financial inclusion will need to undertake an assessment of its current 
policy, legal and regulatory framework, institutional environment, characteristics 
of targeted consumer groups, and the state of technology in the country relative 
to what is available internationally.
To move forward effectively, each country must also establish effective coor-
dination and consultation mechanisms among the key players at all levels: macro

(government policy makers, central banks, and other regulators); meso- and 
micro-level institutions (financial institutions and MNOs, and their associations 
and facilitating organizations); and consumers (through advocacy agencies and 
survey data). Key objectives for such coordination are to balance the interests of 
the different actors, ensure that the playing field is level, and, above all, strike the 
right balance among expanding outreach, mitigating risks to the stability and 
security of the system, and protecting the consumers.
The lessons provided in this study are intended to help flatten the learning 
curve for taking advantage of e-money and other innovations to extend access 
to financial services, especially for South Asian and other developing countries. 
By establishing a conducive legal and regulatory framework and providing 
appropriate incentives to both private providers and customers, countries can 
accelerate financial inclusion to promote a more inclusive society and shared 
prosperity.

Environmental Benefits Statement
The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint. 
In support of this commitment, we leverage electronic publishing options and 
print-on-demand technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide. 
Together, these initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping distances 
decreased, resulting in reduced paper consumption, chemical use, greenhouse gas 
emissions, and waste. 
We follow the recommended standards for paper use set by the Green 
Press  Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship 
Council (FSC)–certified paper, with nearly all containing 50–100 percent 
­recycled ­content. The recycled fiber in our book paper is either unbleached 
or  bleached using totally chlorine-free (TCF), processed chlorine–free (PCF), 
or enhanced elemental chlorine–free (EECF) processes. 
More information about the Bank’s environmental philosophy can be found 
at http://www.worldbank.org/corporateresponsibility.

Moving toward universal access to financial services is within reach, thanks to new technologies, transformative 
business models, and ambitious reforms. Instruments such as e-money accounts and mobile accounts, along 
with debit cards and low-cost traditional bank accounts, can significantly increase financial access for those 
who are excluded.
Bringing E-money to the Poor: Successes and Failures examines the lessons of success from four country case 
studies of “gazelles”—Kenya, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—that leapt from limitation to innovation by 
successfully enabling the deployment of e-money technology. These countries have thereby transformed the 
landscape of financial access to their poor. In addition, two country case studies (Maldives and the Philippines) 
yield lessons learned from constraints that stalled e-money deployments. Because technology is not a silver 
bullet, the case studies also explore other strategic elements that need to be in place for a country to expand 
access to financial services through digital technology.
