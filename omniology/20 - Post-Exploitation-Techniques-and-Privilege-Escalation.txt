Post-exploitation involves consolidating control
over a compromised system and potentially
escalating 
privileges 
to 
achieve 
a 
more
comprehensive compromise.
Throughout the
exploration of post-
exploitation
techniques, ethical
considerations
remain essential. 
Ethical 
hackers 
need 
to 
understand 
various
techniques, including exploiting misconfigurations,
abusing weak permissions, and using privilege
escalation 
vulnerabilities, 
tailored 
to 
different
systems like Windows and Linux.
