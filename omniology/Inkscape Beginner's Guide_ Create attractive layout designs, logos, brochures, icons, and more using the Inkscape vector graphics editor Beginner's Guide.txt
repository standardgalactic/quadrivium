About the Reviewers
Mark Bystry is a design engineer by trade. He is also an open source software enthusiast 
with a penchant for graphic art. Drawing and illustration, 3D modeling, desktop publishing, 
photography, and videography are just a few of his many interests. Those things also spill 
into his daily work duties. Mark has come to rely on Inkscape as well as several other leading 
open source applications to achieve a full range of graphic tasks.
Several years ago Mark teamed up with his online pal, Richard Querin, when they recognized 
a void within the Inkscape user community, specifically the lack of educational information 
dedicated to the use of Inkscape. Their vision was of a series of instructional videos geared 
towards beginners.
Since that time Richard and Mark have made over one hundred videos demonstrating various 
functions within the application. Though their video series has tapered off, mainly due to their 
insatiable need to explore all that the technological world has to offer, they still remain avid 
users of Inkscape and continue to guide novice users in the achievement of their goals.
Jose Olarte III is a graphic designer and photographer from Baguio City, Philippines. He 
specializes in: user interface design for web, mobile and desktop platforms; print design for 
magazines and other publications; logo and icon design. When he's not busy pushing pixels 
and stretching ems, he gets his social fix by tweeting away his thoughts: twitter.com/
brownspank
I would like to thank my wife Vanessa for putting up with my extended 
hours and sharing my passion for work, without which I wouldn't have the 
strength and motivation to move forward with my creative endeavors.

Richard Querin is a practicing structural engineer with a passion for graphic design, 
photography, and other creative pursuits. He has contributed graphic design work to several 
different free and open source projects including websites, mobile and desktop applications, 
conference graphics, and print advertisements. He has also done numerous Inkscape video 
tutorials as a co-contributor to the screencasters.heathenx.org website.
I would like to thank my family for putting up with my creative antics and 
providing me the time and space to take on creative pursuits such as 
these. Thanks also go to my friend and Inkscape compatriot Mark Bystry 
for his help throughout the years and to Joel Goveya for his patience when 
it came to getting my reviews back. And finally, a special thanks to my 
wonderful daughter Emily for making fatherhood an absolute delight.
Sylvia Slokker is a graphics freelancer and IT professional. She started her career in web 
design and development in 2001, abandoning the career path of process engineer after 
almost 10 years.
Sylvia moved continents to chase a dream and currently works as a web developer in 
Australia. She has been creating vector designs since 1994, using both commercial as 
well as open source software. Nowadays, she uses Inkscape almost exclusively for all 
her vector work. Sylvia writes tutorials for the web under the nickname Syllie and runs: 
verysimpledesigns.com as a tutorial site for the novice Inkscape artist.

Preface
Are you ready to jump into the world of graphic design and illustration? Or have you just begun 
to explore new tools that can broaden your skill set in these specialties? Inkscape Beginner's 
Guide is the perfect book to start this journey into the world of vector graphics. This book  
starts at the very basics of a complex, open source tool on the market today – Inkscape 0.48 
(current version as of the publication of this book). Learn everything you need to know from 
setting up a document file to completing your first illustration.
The Inkscape graphics editor can be daunting when just learning the tool. There are so many 
features one may not know where to start. Inkscape Beginner's Guide can help to alleviate 
these fears; it takes a simple step-by-step approach to learning the software. It starts at the 
very beginning, unlocking the secret to the software's interface, explaining menus and the 
overall areas of the user interface, and then jumps into real projects that illustrate some 
simple graphic-building concepts.
Expect to learn everything from using paths, text styles, filters, and images—while building 
a brochure, logo, icons, illustration, and more—all in the context of real graphic design, 
illustration, or web projects. Using an informative but simple approach, learning Inkscape 
becomes a fun and interactive process.
Welcome to the world of Inkscape 0.48 and vector graphics! This book is an informational 
step-by-step beginner's book for someone just starting their journey in using Inkscape 0.48 
in the creation of vector graphics. No previous experience using Inkscape 0.48 or other 
previous vector graphics programs are required. The book will be chalked full of real-world 
examples, detailed step-by-step instructions and associated screen captures to keep the 
information approachable yet easy to digest—and don't forget fun!
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Getting Started with Vector Graphics, starts before Inkscape, at the beginning  
of vector graphics. We begin by defining vector graphics and how they are used online and 
within print projects. Then we start digging into Inkcape learning about how the program 
began and how it fits in the world of vector graphics today.

Preface
[ 2 ]
Chapter 2, Installing and Opening Inkscape, discusses where to download Inkscape 0.48, the 
most recent version of the software and its unique features, as well as detailed descriptions 
about how to install the software. Included in this are screen captures that define the 
main areas of the program and menu items—all of which is very helpful when opening the 
software for the first time.
Chapter 3, How to Manage Files, is all about files and managing them. Inkscape can import 
a number of file formats and then edit them. Then, after completing a project Inkscape has 
the ability to save and export graphics in a number of formats. We will discuss all of these 
options as well as the native Inkscape SVG format and the benefits of using project folders.
Chapter 4, Creating your First Graphics, starts by defining paths and shapes, a basis for all 
projects going forward in Inkscape. Then it focuses on creating your very first Inkscape object 
– a star. Also discussed in this chapter are ellipses, complex shapes, freehand object, grids, 
and guidelines.
Chapter 5, How to Work with Layers, is all about layers in Inkscape. You will learn the basics 
like how to create new layers, delete, arrange, and blend layers, as well as hiding and 
duplicating layers, all the while working on a sample blog header project.
Chapter 6, Building Objects, helps you learn about objects and how Inkscape interprets 
them, how to change object features, change fill and stroke, grouping objects, combining 
objects, and how to best use the masking and clipping features.
Chapter 7, Using Paths focuses, on using paths. Again we start with the basics: defining 
paths, how to work with them in Inkscape, transforming, combining, and placing paths. The 
bulk of this chapter will focus on an illustration project that will assist you in learning all you 
need to know about paths.
Chapter 8, How to Style Text, teaches how you can manipulate and style text for any design. 
It is a practical chapter that covers using paths and text to create visual appeal, text and 
frames, the basics like spellcheck and find/replace, text effects, and a simple project to show 
how to create a text reflection.
Chapter 9, Using Filters, focuses on using filters with text and images to give a further 
dimension to your vector graphics. Projects will focus on using images and text—including  
a detailed example with step-by-step instructions on using filters with text.
Chapter 10, Extensions in Inkscape, is as expected, about extensions or templates and  
plugins that can assist in the design process for vector graphics. You will learn how to  
install templates, extensions, and about the availability of certain extension or scripts that  
might be useful.
Chapter 11, Working with Images, is all about importing photographs or images into 
Inkscape and manipulating them. Specifically, you will be working on a few sample projects 
that deal with photographs and filters.

Preface
[ 3 ]
Chapter 12, Using the XML Editor, teaches you about the XML editor that is included within 
Inkscape. It covers the basic XML structure tree, as well as how you can manipulate this code 
to change objects in your projects.
Appendix A, Where to Find More Information, provides web links to people and places that 
can help you learn even more about Inkscape.
Appendix B, Keyboard Shortcuts, mentions the basic keyboard shortcuts for Inkscape 0.48.
Appendix C, Glossary of Terms, is a glossary of Inkscape and basic design terms used 
throughout the book.
What you need for this book
You'll need the latest version of Inkscape 0.48 and Internet access (to download some 
example clip art and projects).
If you are using a Mac, then you may also need the X11 app on your system to run Inkscape

Getting Started with Vector Graphics
Inkscape is an open source, free program that creates vector-based graphics 
that can be used in web and print design, in interface and logo creation, and 
in material cutting. Its capabilities are similar to those of commercial products 
such as Adobe Illustrator, Macromedia Freehand, and CorelDraw and can be 
used for any number of practical purposes—creating vector graphics for use 
in illustrations, business letterheads, computer and electronic wallpapers, and 
designing web pages and the elements within them.
This is a beginner's guide to using Inkscape. This means you will learn all the ins 
and outs of using this software—including all the details about the interface, 
menus, buttons, as well as how to create graphics. We'll start with the very 
basic parts of graphics and build up as we continue through the book to more 
complex graphics projects pointing out how you would use these items in 
everyday projects.
However, before learning the details on how to use Inkscape, let's take a step 
back and define vector graphics, how a computer displays them, how vector 
graphics work together, and why we want to use them in design.
Specifically, this chapter will teach you the following:


What vector graphics are


Scalable Vector Graphics and Inkscape


Reasons for using vector graphics over rasterized images


How vector graphics are used in design
Let's get started!

Getting Started with Vector Graphics
[ 8 ]
What are vector graphics?
A vector graphic is made up of points, lines, curves, and shapes or polygons, which are all 
based on mathematical equations. Inkscape uses these objects and can convert them into 
paths. A path is a line with a start and end, which are also calculated with a mathematical 
equation. These paths are not limited to being straight—they can be of any shape, size, and 
even encompass any number of curves. When you combine them, they create drawings, 
diagrams, and can even help create certain fonts.
How does this all relate to vector-based graphics? Vector-based graphics aren't made up of 
pixels. Since they are resolution-independent, you can make them larger (by scaling) and 
the image quality will stay the same, lines and edges stay clean, and the same images can be 
used on items as small as letterheads or business cards, blown up to be billboards, or used 
in high-definition animation sequences. This flexibility, often accompanied by smaller file 
sizes, makes vector graphics ideal—especially in the world of Internet, computer displays of 
varying resolution, and hosting services for web pages. Inkscape can help in the navigation 
of those waters of vector graphics and is a tool that can be invaluable when designing for the 
digital world as well as print.
These characteristics make vector graphics very different from JPEGs, GIFs, or BMP  
images—all of which are considered raster or bitmap images, made up of tiny squares  
called pixels or bits. If you magnify these images, you will see that they are made up of  
a grid (or bitmap), and if magnified further, they will become blurry and grainy as each  
pixel with bitmap square's zoom level grows larger.
Programs that use vector graphics
As stated earlier in the chapter, many programs and applications are similar to Inkscape and 
can open vector graphics. Some can only open these files for viewing purposes and others 
can edit them.
Other applications typically used for page layout, but which can open and manipulate vector 
graphics include Scribus, Quark Xpress, and Adobe InDesign. Scribus is unique in that it is also 
open source (as Inkscape is) and can even import SVG files (the file type Inkscape uses) and 
manipulate them. The other programs can open, import, place, scale, and distort .eps files, 
a vector graphic file type, but unfortunately cannot create or otherwise modify vector graphics.

Chapter 1
[ 9 ]
To create vector graphics, you will use illustration programs like Inkscape—which this book 
is about—or other programs like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Freehand Corel Draw, Freehand, 
XARA Xtreme, or Serif DrawPlus. These programs all have native file formats, but allow 
you to export your graphics as .eps or .svg files, as needed. What is different about these 
applications than those for page layout is that you start with a completely blank document 
that allows you to fully design or draw what you would like, whereas the page layout 
application focuses on full page layouts.
Vector formats
In the previous section, it was noted that .eps, an Encapsulated Post Script file, is a 
common vector graphic format—or open format—that can be read by most applications 
that open and/or create vector graphics. However, there are other file formats that are 
also considered vector-graphic compatible. These include Inkscape's .svg format, Adobe 
Illustrator (.ai), Adobe Freehand (.Fhx), and Adobe Flash files, which are mostly vector 
data and are considered proprietary formats, tied more directly to the prospective software 
that can open them.
There are a number of other proprietary graphic file formats which can include vector 
graphics within them as well as rasterized (or bitmap) graphics. These include:


Adobe Photoshop (.psd): This includes vector layers such as text, shapes, and paths


Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (.pdf): This contains vector data  
and bitmap images in different forms


The Encapsulated Post Script file (.eps): This, again, can hold both vector data  
and bitmap images
Also note that .eps files are basically the same files a Post Script laser printer uses. Both file 
types are developed by Adobe and are the foundation of the Adobe PDF format.
Scalable Vector Graphics
What does Inkscape use? A completely different file format—one that is fairly complex in 
nature, but works well for the flexible nature of vector graphics. They can be edited within 
Inkscape and can be opened in a text editor and edited at an XML code level. Inkscape uses 
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), a vector-based drawing format that incorporates some  
basic principles:


A drawing can (and should) be scalable to any size without losing detail


A drawing can use an unlimited number of smaller drawings used in any number  
of ways (and reused) and still be a part of a larger whole

Getting Started with Vector Graphics
[ 10 ]
More specifically, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based file format for describing 
two-dimensional vector graphics. The specification defines an open standard that has been 
in development with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.
Inkscape was built with SVG and the W3C web standards in mind, which give it a number 
of features, including a rich body of XML (Extensible Markup Language) with complete 
descriptions. Inkscape drawings can be reused in other SVG-compliant drawing programs and 
can adapt to different presentation methods. The .svg format has growing support across 
most web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer).
The SVG files then, which are inherently XML, can be searched, indexed, scripted, and 
compressed within a text editor. In fact, they can be created and edited with a text editor if 
required, but drawing programs like Inkscape can create the SVG files. In fact, Inkscape has an 
XML editor feature which allows direct edits to the XML files; more information on this is in 
Chapter 12, How you can use the XML Editor.
Advantages of an open-standard vector format
There are some slight differences between traditional vector graphics and SVG. All vector 
graphics are scalable, use smaller-sized files, and have the flexibility to be resized when 
needed. However, the vector graphic format of SVG has even more detailed advantages  
than the vector graphic native.
Additional advantages of SVG vector images over proprietary formats
SVG vector images, because they are based on XML, have some distinct advantages over 
open standard vector formats. These are as follows:


They can be read and modified by a large range of tools (including browsers, text 
editors, and other vector graphics software, as described previously)


They are smaller and more compressible than JPEG and GIF images which are often 
used in web design


They are also scalable, like vector graphics


Text in SVG can be searched, edited, indexed, and more


SVG is an open-standard


SVG files are pure XML, which allows them to be opened in other programs (or even 
a text editor) and edited in non-graphical UI ways (or by programmers directly)


Most modern browsers offer some support for SVG. Internet Explorer 8, however, 
does not offer this support

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
There are still some limitations in the Inkscape program, even though it aims to be fully  
SVG-compliant. For example, as of version 0.48, it still does not support animation or use 
SVG fonts within the software for design—though there are plans to add these capabilities 
into future versions.
Disadvantages of vector graphics over non-vector formats
The biggest drawback to vector graphic formats is that they are not ideally suited to working 
with photographs. Sure, Inkscape and other vector graphic applications can open, import, 
or place photographs into projects, but the colors and complexities of displaying the 
photograph will essentially overwhelm the application. Also, as stated earlier, as photographs 
are very much rasterized images being imported into the vector-based application, once you 
re-size or scale the photograph, the integrity of the photograph can be lost.
This same complexity will appear for advanced coloring and lighting effects when using 
vector graphics as well—the more you try to make it look like a photograph, the more  
you might need to rasterize part of the vector graphic as well, essentially making it a  
non-vector graphic.
Another known drawback for vector graphics is interoperability. If you want to share files 
between vector graphic applications, you might run into some issues, even when you use .eps 
files which are more universally accepted as a vector graphic format. Vector information can be 
lost during the conversion. All fonts, elements, and objects need to be embedded (not linked) 
and tested thoroughly—however, this sharing is not impossible and entirely depends on the 
applications being used. Using Inkscape across teams as the development tool can help solve 
this problem as the application is open source and free to download.
If you are new to design, you might be surprised to learn that even when you are using a 
word processing program, you are using vector graphics all the time—fonts! Fonts illustrate 
two common properties of vector graphics:


An entire font, with all its letters, numbers, and symbols, has a very small file size


Fonts can be set to any size without losing quality
Some vector-based applications, including Inkscape, allow you to convert text to paths so 
you can modify the shapes of the letters themselves.
Determining when to use vector or rasterized graphics
We've spent a lot of time discussing vector graphics and how they differ from rasterized 
bitmap images. In doing so, it is also important to know when it is best to use each type, 
because there are instances when it does make sense to use one over the other.

Getting Started with Vector Graphics
[ 12 ]
Let's say we're doing a project that will get printed; a brochure—and for best results, we'll 
use both vector and bitmap graphics. We'll look at the most basic steps of how to put this 
brochure together in the following section.
Time for action – basic design
For this example, let's look at the design elements and determine how we would put them 
together in a design:
1.	 Determine the exact size of the brochure. For our example, we'll focus on creating 
the outside of an 8.5 x 11 tri-fold brochure. Specifically, the cover design of this 
brochure is as follows:

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
2.	 Design a basic front cover layout. We'll use the following one for the cover:
3.	 Decide on the elements we will use for the design. For ours, we'll have a 
photograph, company logo, brochure title, and some additional copy.
What just happened?
We just did the basic planning required to create a brochure in any graphics program.  
We determined the physical size of the document, the basic layout, as well as the elements 
we have available for use in the design.
Time for action – vector versus rasterized images
Now we need to figure out what elements go where and which graphic types will work best. 
Determine what type of graphics each of our design elements should be to best suit our 
needs (and the design) and make sure we have the files in that format.
1.	 Photographs naturally have a lot of colors and gradients, and are often taken in a 
fixed size from a digital camera. That said, the files are rasterized bitmaps and can be 
in any number of file formats—including .tif, .jpg, .gif, or .png, and are larger 
in size. Photographs don't lend themselves to being vector graphics.

Getting Started with Vector Graphics
[ 14 ]
2.	 Logos should be portable, so that they can look clean at any size and resolution.  
The graphics themselves are often simple with less color variation and therefore 
lend themselves to being vector graphics as opposed to bitmaps. We'll use a 
graphic-based on one in the Openclipart.org collection, which will be  
explained later, as an example for a company logo. You can use files of the  
SVG, AI, or EPS format.
3.	 The company name/title and copy will be text, which is a font and vector graphic. 
It can still be scaled to accommodate both the boldness of the company name and 
also be a body copy for the brochure:
What just happened?
We took each piece of the design puzzle and determined the best file types for each 
element. We collected our files and got them ready for the design phase, which is up next.
Time for action – building brochure files
Take all of the elements we defined—both bitmaps and vector graphics—and create the 
outside design of the brochure as follows:

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
What just happened?
We looked at a full brochure design to determine which elements should be rasterized 
bitmaps and which should be vector graphics. When done correctly, the graphics seamlessly  
work together in a design.
Pop quiz – understanding vector graphics
What are the advantages of scalable vector graphics?
a.	 Smaller file sizes which can be compressed
b.	 Projects can be printed at any resolution
c.	
Can be searched, edited, and indexed with a text editor
d.	 All of the above

Summary
This chapter was dedicated to teaching you the basics about vector graphics and how they 
differ from bitmap images. We learned how vector graphics are resolution-independent and 
why we might want to use them in design, how Inkscape supports Scalable Vector Graphics 
(SVG), which is an open format, and the advantages of using these types of open graphics 
instead of proprietary. We also took some practical time learning to distinguish when it is 
best to use vector graphics and when raster images are needed.
Now it is time to learn how to install Inkscape 0.48 and begin creating vector graphics of  
our own!

Let's get started and start downloading!
Inkscape's features
Inkscape is a free, open source program developed by a group of volunteers under the GNU 
General Public License (GPL). You not only get a free download but can use the program to 
create items with it and freely distribute them, modify the program itself, and share that 
modified program with others.

Installing and Opening Inkscape
[ 18 ]
Inkscape uses Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), a vector-based drawing language, as 
described in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Vector Graphics. The basic principles that  
apply to SVG graphics apply to Inkscape principles as well:


A drawing can (and should) be scalable to any size without losing detail


A drawing can use an unlimited number of smaller drawings that can be used  
in any number of ways (and reused) and be a part of a larger whole
The current Inkscape version at the time of this book being printed is 0.48.2.1 and the 0.48.3 
version will be available before Inkscape 0.49 is released.
Installing Inkscape 
Inkscape is available for download for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, or Solaris operating 
systems. Before you install Inkscape, you will need to check that you have all of the required 
elements, listed as follows:


Operating system: Windows XP, Vista, 7, Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, 10.5 Leopard or 10.6 
Snow Leopard, or higher. Most Linux distributions are supported. Note: Windows 
98/ME and 2000 are no longer supported.


To run on the Mac OS X operating system, Inkscape typically runs under X11—an 
implementation of the X Window System software that makes it possible to run 
X11-based applications in Mac OS X. The X11 application has shipped with the Mac 
OS X since version 10.5. Snow Leopard requires Apple X11/XQuartz 2.3.4 or higher. 
Leopard requires Apple X11 2.1.6 or XQuartz. Tiger requires Apple X11 1.1.3.
When you open Inkscape on a Mac, it will first open X11 and run 
Inkscape within that program. Loss of some shortcut key options 
will occur, but all functionality is present using menus and toolbars.


Disk space: A minimum of 190 MB free. More free space is required to store your 
graphics projects. You can, however, run a portable version of Inkscape on some 
operating systems (like Windows 7). These installations can run on a portable USB 
drive and only require 80 MB of space.


Inkscape requires an Internet connection if you plan to use the Open Clip  
Art Library.
Open Clip Art Library is only available on a Macintosh installation.

In a few simple steps, you downloaded the Inkscape installation package and installed it on 
your system. When Inkscape opens for the first time, you will see the main screen, as shown 
in the following screenshot, with a new blank document ready to go:
In this book, the screenshots will be specific to the Mac OS X software. Don't 
be concerned if this is not your computer operating system of choice; the 
software itself is very similar between them and notable differences in the 
Inkscape software screens will be highlighted.
Troubleshooting installation
Installing Inkscape is generally pretty simple to do. However, if you run into any issues, take 
note of the following tips:


Make a note of your computer's manufacturer, operating system type, and version 
and make sure you downloaded the appropriate installation package.


Also remember once the installation has occurred, the Inkscape icon to launch the 
software will be in the Application or Programs folder on your computer

The basics of the software
The Inkscape interface is based on the GNOME UI standard, which uses visual cues and 
feedback for any icons. For example:


Hovering your mouse over any icon displays a pop-up description of the icon.


If an icon has a dark gray border, it is active and can be used.


If an icon is grayed out, it is not currently available to use with the current selection.


All icons that are in execution mode (or busy) are covered by a dark shadow. This 
signifies that the application is busy and won't respond to any edit request.


There is a Notification region in the status bar on the main screen that displays 
dynamic help messages. These messages display key shortcuts and basic information 
on how to use the Inkscape software based on which objects and tools are selected.

Time for action – getting started with Inkscape
In order to feel completely comfortable using the Inkscape software, let's learn the basics of 
the Inkscape interface. This will include menus, toolbars, and dialog boxes. Let's get started!
Find the Inkscape icon in the Application or Programs folder and double-click it to open 
the program.
You will see the main window of the Inkscape software, as follows, with different areas of  
the screen highlighted. Within the main screen, there is the main menu, command, snap  
and status bar, tool controls, and a color palette, as shown in the following screenshot:
On some external resources, canvas and page are used almost interchangeably 
in terms of the Inkscape interface. Technically, however, a canvas is the entire 
editable area, whereas the page area is the area within the page borders.

Chapter 2
[ 23 ]
1.	 You will use the main menu frequently when working on your projects. This is the 
central location to find every tool and menu item in the program—even those found 
in the visual-based toolbars below it on the screen. When you select a main menu 
item in Inkscape, you see a menu drop-down with a text description and shortcut 
key combination for the feature. This can be helpful when first learning the program 
as it provides you with easier and often faster ways to use the most commonly-used 
functions of the program.
Let's take a general tour of the toolbars seen on this main screen. We'll pay close 
attention to the tools we'll use most frequently.
2.	 The command bar toolbar contains the most frequently-used commands  
in Inkscape.
As seen in the previous image, you can create a new document, open an existing 
one, save, print, cut, paste, zoom, add text, and much more. Hover your mouse over 
each icon for details about its function. By default, when you open Inkscape, this 
toolbar is on the top of the main screen:
3.	 Found vertically on the right-hand side of the main screen, the snap bar toolbar is 
designed to help with the snap to features of Inkscape.
It lets you easily align items (snap to guides), force objects to align to paths  
(snap to paths), or snap to bounding boxes and edges. More on alignment and  
snap to bounding boxes will be explained in later chapters of the book when we 
start building example projects.

Installing and Opening Inkscape
[ 24 ]
The tool controls options change depending on which tool you have selected in the 
toolbox (described in the next section). When you are creating objects, it provides 
you with all the detailed options—size, position, angles, and attributes—specific 
to the tool you are currently using. With the Select tool active, it looks like the 
following image:
The tool controls bar is located on the top of the main window, just below the 
command bar.
You have options to select/deselect objects within a layer, rotate or mirror objects, 
adjust object locations on the canvas and scaling options, and much more. Use it to 
define object properties when they are selected on the canvas.
4.	 You'll use the toolbox frequently. It is located on the left-hand side of the screen and 
contains all of the main tools for creating objects, selecting and modifying objects, 
and drawing. To select a tool, click the icon. If you double-click a tool, you can see 
that tool's preferences (and change them).

Chapter 2
[ 25 ]
5.	 The palette bar of the Inkscape screen controls fill and stroke color options. Fill is 
the color that fills the object or shape. Alternatively, stroke is the outline around the 
object or shape.
Using the palette bar, there are a few ways you can set the fill and stroke  
in Inkscape:


From the palette bar, click a color and drag it from the palette onto objects 
to change their fill. If you hold the Shift key and drag a color box onto an 
object, it will set the stroke color.


Select an object on your canvas by clicking it and then right-click a color  
box in the palette. A pop-up menu appears with options to set the fill  
and stroke.


Select an object on your canvas and then left-click a color box in the palette 
to immediately set the fill of an object. Press Shift and left-click a color box 
to immediately set the stroke color.
There are a large number of color boxes to choose from. Use the palette bar scroll 
bar along the bottom to see more choices to the right of those displaying on the 
screen. You can also click the small caret at the right end of the toolbar to allow  
for a greater selection of colors—even customizable color palettes as well.
6.	 The status bar contains information relating to a selected object within the canvas  
or page of your document. You can also use it to modify canvas settings:
Here are the details:


Style Indicator focuses a bit more on the selected object. If you select any 
object on your canvas, you can change its fill (overall color of the object) 
or stroke (border color). Drag a color from the palette to this section for 
easy color changes. Right-clicking the Style Indicators provides a pop-up 
menu, letting you make quick and easy coloring edits. Double-clicking the 

Installing and Opening Inkscape
[ 26 ]
Style Indicators will launch the Fill & Stroke dialog box. If you right-click the 
number next to the Stroke Style Indicator, you will get a choice of Stroke 
thicknesses to choose from.


The Opacity Setting is the drop-down box near the Style Indicators.  
Right-click the drop-down box to change the opacity (or transparency) 
percentage (%) value (the default is 100%). A pop-up menu displays a  
set of preset values to choose from. If you left-click the drop-down box,  
it allows direct entry of a value or a change of the value with the  
up/down arrows.


Layer information: Within Inkscape, when you create documents, you 
can have many layers of objects. This gives great flexibility when creating 
graphics of any kind. You can move groups of objects at once (placing a 
group of them on a layer) and separate objects by layer to manipulate and 
affect how they interact with one another when stacked, re-ordered, or 
hidden. You can also set certain settings by layer. You can even create drafts 
or different versions of mockups and keep all of this in one file.


The layer information lets you choose which layer you are currently using 
and placing objects to—this is called the drawing layer. You can then 
set whether this layer is visible or locked. Sometimes you can use your 
documents as a working draft and decide to hide certain layers while 
developing others. You might also lock layers when you have specified 
the exact positioning that you require and you don't want it accidentally 
changed while manipulating other layers. Changing the visibility of layers 
can also speed up editing when working on large or very detailed objects.


Notification area: This contains hints or tricks about the objects or area you 
currently have selected in your document. Keep an eye on this area because 
it guides you with helpful information as you work within the layer. This 
feature is unique to Inkscape and the help messages change and update as 
you use the software to reflect your available options.

Chapter 2
[ 27 ]


Pointer or cursor position: When designing any space— either for print or 
web—it is often important to get the precise placement of objects. To help 
do this, sometimes you want to see when/where your cursor or pointer is 
placed on the screen. This is the area on the Inkscape main screen where 
you can always see the exact x (horizontal) and y (vertical) placement of 
your cursor within the document. The given X and Y coordinates are relative 
to the bottom-left corner of the document area.


Zoom: Use the zoom tools to magnify your canvas for super close-up work 
or to zoom out to see the whole canvas in one shot. If you right-click the 
zoom field, a pop-up menu with commonly-used preset zoom levels is 
displayed from which you can select one to immediately adjust the canvas 
to. This is particularly useful with illustrations containing lots of details 
because you can customize your viewable magnification at any time  
and to whatever level you would like.


Window resize: By default, Inkscape opens to a default window size. With 
this resize window option in the lower-right side of this area, you can click, 
hold, and drag the window to an appropriate size for your computer screen. 
Alternatively, you can choose to make the window full-screen by going to 
the main menu and choosing View and then Full Screen (press F11 on a 
Windows or Linux-based system). When re-opening a .svg file, Inkscape 
will resize itself to the size that the window was when the file was saved. 
The window size information is stored in the Inkscape .svg file itself.

Understanding a new document
Now that we have learned all the menus and toolbars, let's dig into what you can do with 
your first open document.
Time for action – learning more about the main screen
When you open Inkscape for the first time, it opens a blank document automatically and you 
are ready to roll. However, you can just as easily open another new document by going to 
the main menu and selecting File | New.
You will be offered a number of choices of canvas sizes. Let's discuss the details of the canvas 
and some additional properties of the interface that you will use when opening documents.
The terms 'canvas' and 'page' are used interchangeably within the Inkscape interface.  
For simplicity, we'll refer to the canvas as the entire portion of the open document screen.  
A page is the portion of the canvas that is contained within the printable area—seen as a 
black-bordered box in the following screenshot:
With the main screen still open in Inkscape, let's discuss this portion of the application screen:

Chapter 2
[ 29 ]
1.	 You can always adjust the page—or printable area—size. Go to the main menu, 
select File, and then select Document Properties. In the Document Properties 
window Page tab, look in the Format field. You can select any number of  
pre-defined sizes or change the Custom Size field measurements to your liking.
The pre-defined sizes are specific to print media, while those found in  
the main menu, File | New path, give common web design, logo, or web  
banner-sized templates.
As soon as you make changes to these properties, you can see them reflected  
on your screen:

2.	 Dockable dialogs are a great feature in Inkscape 0.48. They give you more freedom 
in your screen layout. You can show (or hide) dialog boxes on the right-hand side of 
your screen:
Useful dialogs that can be docked on the right-hand side of the screen are:


Layers


Transform


Path Effect


SVG Font Editor


Filter Editor

Chapter 2
[ 31 ]
The docked dialogs can be minimized, rearranged, stacked, and undocked into a 
separate window on your desktop. Here's how to do some of the basics:


Showing dialog boxes: To show these dialog boxes, on the main menu, 
select View and select Show/Hide Dialogs. Then go to the Layer, Object, 
Path, or Text menus and choose the Editor, Layer, or Property options to 
show the correlating dialog box.


Displaying more than one dialog box: If you open more than one dialog 
box, they will stack in the order they were opened in the dialog area of the 
main screen. Use the scroll bar to see those below the first viewable dialog.


Minimizing dialog boxes: You can minimize a dialog so it appears as an icon. 
To do this, press the right arrow button, along the right-hand side of the 
title bar of each dialog box. This places a shortcut along the right side of  
the Inkscape screen. To re-open it, just click the text/icon and the dialog  
re-opens to the large state on the screen.


Floating dialog boxes: Dialogs can also be dragged off the main window 
into their own window. Each dialog can have its own window or they can be 
grouped in floating docks.

For initial designs of any kind, these Dockable dialogs can be extremely 
useful. Having the Layers Dockable dialog visible is particularly useful,  
as it lets you select layers and re-order them quickly:

3.	 There are several ways to view your canvas or page in an open document.  
Panning means moving left and right, or up and down on the main screen.
The easiest way to pan to the left or right is to use the horizontal scroll bar along the 
bottom of your Inkscape screen. Panning up and down can be done with the vertical 
scroll bar on the right-hand side of the screen. If you have a mouse with a scroll 
wheel you can use it to pan as well. Just scrolling with the wheel moves the canvas 
up and down. Pressing Shift on the keyboard and then using the scroll wheel moves 
it sideways.
As discussed in the status bar overview, you can use the zoom tool to magnify your 
canvas, so that you can see a lot of detail (zoomed in) or the entire canvas at a 
glance (zoomed out). By default, Inkscape will open documents at about 35%. You 
can also use the zoom tool on the toolbox [inline graphic], a mouse with a scroll 
wheel and the Ctrl key, or use your keypad (= or + zoom in and - zooms out).

Chapter 2
[ 33 ]
For easy access to the Zoom to fit selection, Zoom to fit drawing, and Zoom to fit 
page in the window options, see options in the command bar. These options can 
also be set from the main menu by selecting View | Zoom.
What just happened?
The canvas or page in your Inkscape document can be a useful space, especially if you know 
how to use it best. We learned that 'canvas' and 'page' are interchangeable terms, as well 
as how to use scrollbars and all the intricacies of panning, zooming, and using Dockable 
dialogs—which will be a common item that you will return to again and again as you work  
on Inkscape projects.
Have a go hero – floating Dockable dialogs
Much like with the toolbars, you can move Dockable dialogs to be floating windows on your 
screen as well:


To move any of the Dockable dialogs from their docking point on the left-hand side, 
click-and-drag the title bar out of the window


To close the Dockable dialog, click the close button (outer-right) or click the dialog 
close button (on the title bar, next to icon)


To re-dock the dialog, you must click-and-drag the title bar into the Dockable area

Summary
We started this chapter by talking at a high level about Inkscape 0.48 and what you can do 
with it. We then jumped right into learning how to download Inkscape, detailed descriptions 
about how to install the software, and discussed all the main areas of the screen when 
opening it for the first time. We even talked a little bit about how to troubleshoot the 
Inkscape installation and where to find the best information about the software—no matter 
what your issue.
After opening our first document, we talked about changing the document properties  
and the value of scrolling, panning, and zooming. We even jumped into learning the basics 
of the software that will be key in starting our very own project. This is where we will start 
with Chapter 3, How to Manage your Files. Get ready to learn how to set up a project and 
get started!

How to Manage Files
This chapter is all about files and managing them. Inkscape can import a 
number of file formats, edit them, and save them in a number of formats.  
We will discuss all of that as well as the native Inkscape SVG format, benefits  
of using projects folder, and embedding versus linking image files.
The following topics will be discussed in this chapter:


Creating new files


Saving Inkscape files


Creating a customized default document


How to structure project files


Importing non-native Inkscape files


Embedding and linking image files
Creating new files
As previously, stated when you first open Inkscape, a new document is opened and ready to 
start. However, it uses a default size of A4. You will likely need a whole array of other sizes for 
print, web design, or even custom sizes. Here's how to access all of the predefined document 
dimensions Inkscape offers and details on how to adjust them manually for your needs.

How to Manage Files
[ 36 ]
Using predefined-sized document dimensions
To see all predefined document dimensions Inkscape has to offer, go the main menu and 
choose File and then New.
Inkscape has many predefined sizes already generated for you.
For web design, you can choose from the following:


Desktops with sizes 1024 x 768, 1600 x 1200, 640 x 480, or 800 x 600


Web banners with sizes 468 x 60 or 728 x 90


Icon sizes ranging from 16 x 16, 32 x 32, and 48 x 48
For print, there are many sizes you can choose from:


Letters: Standard US, A4


Business card sizes: 84 x 54mm, 90 X 50mm


CD Cover_300dpi: 343 X 340


CD label: 120x120


DVD covers: Regular, slim, super slim, and ultra slim
However, you can always change document dimensions to a custom size whenever you 
like. Just go to the main menu and select File and then Document Properties. You'll see the 
Document Properties window displayed with a number of options for customizing your 
canvas and printable page.

Chapter 3
[ 37 ]
As shown in the preceding screenshot, within the Format field, you can choose any of the 
predefined values for Page size. Alternatively, you can use the Custom size field to define  
the size directly.
Time for action – creating a new CD cover
Imagine that you would like to use Inkscape to design and create a simple CD cover for  
a new music compilation you created. Here's how to get started and open a predefined 
template in Inkscape:
1.	 Open Inkscape, and from the main menu, select File | New | CD_cover_300dpi.

How to Manage Files
[ 38 ]
2.	 A new document opens to the correct dimensions.
What just happened?
Quite simply, these steps just opened up a new file in Inkscape to the exact dimensions  
of a CD cover.
With the autodefined templates, it takes the guesswork out of dimensions and lets you jump 
right into the design. We'll get back to this CD cover and design in Chapter 4, How to build 
your first graphic.
Pop quiz – how do you change the dimensions of a predefined graphic?
1.	 Once you open a predefined template and start working, what do you do if you need 
to change the dimensions?
a.	 Start the design all over in a new document (from the main menu,  
select File | New).
b.	 Copy and paste the design into another file.
c.	
Go to the document properties (from the main menu, select File | 
Document Properties) and adjust the dimensions and fit the design.

Chapter 3
[ 39 ]
Custom document dimensions
In the last section, we discussed creating a document that uses a predefined size already 
provided in Inkscape, but what if you need to create a file that is custom or not listed in the 
template list?
It's easy. You start with the default page size in Inkscape and then use the Document 
Properties window to adjust to the exact size you need.
Time for action – creating a new custom file size for a postcard
We're going to create a file that will be the exact size for a postcard.
1.	 From the Inkscape main menu, select File | New | Default. This opens a file with the 
default dimensions of A4.
2.	 Now we want to customize those document dimensions. To do this, go to the main 
menu and choose File | Document Properties. You'll see the Document Properties 
window displayed with a number of options for customizing your canvas and 
printable page, as shown in the following screenshot:

How to Manage Files
[ 40 ]
3.	 To change to the custom postcard size of 7 x 5 inches, we need to change the 
following fields in the following order: Units to in (Inches), Width to 7, and Height 
to 5. The changes on the Document Properties window should look similar to the 
following screenshot:
Remember to change the Units first; otherwise the Width and Height fields  
will adjust to the new unit of measure and you will have to readjust them.
Changing page orientation
Also note that you can change the Page Orientation from Portrait 
to Landscape (or vice versa) from the Document Properties screen. 
Change the field from below the Page Size selection box. When 
you do this, Inkscape automatically changes the Width and Height 
values already entered in the Custom Size section.
4.	 Close the Document Properties window/dock by clicking the X at the  
upper-right corner.
5.	 Your page will be resized to the new postcard custom dimensions, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 3
[ 41 ]
6.	 Keep this file open, as we will continue to manipulate it in the next section, Have a 
go hero – adding a print-safe border.
What just happened?
In a nutshell, we opened a new Inkscape file and then adjusted the document properties so 
that the page dimensions were set for our 7 x 5 postcard project. Now we are ready to start 
designing the layout of the postcard.
Have a go hero – adding a print-safe border
So now you have the page dimensions set accurately. What about setting up the file for  
the design? You'll need to create guides around the page edges—about one-eighth of an 
inch—to accommodate for printing and then cutting off the paper to size. Any and all design 
would need to stay within that border to be considered print-safe.
Here's how to set this up:
1.	 Open your 7 X 5 postcard file again (if it is not already open from the last exercise).
2.	 From the main menu, choose File | Document Properties.

How to Manage Files
[ 42 ]
3.	 In the Document Properties window, in the General section, change the Default 
units to in (inches), as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 Now the ruler on the Inkscape screen will display units of inches.
5.	 Now it's time to create guides. Guides are lines on the screen that you will use for 
aligning, that is, guiding objects. These lines are only seen while you are working 
in Inkscape. To create a guide, make sure the Select Tool is selected, click inside 
the ruler area on your main screen and drag towards your page, as shown in the 
following screenshot. A red line represents the guide until you let go of the guide 
and place it on the page. Then the line turns blue.

Chapter 3
[ 43 ]
6.	 To make sure you position a right, left, top, and bottom guide one-eighth of an inch 
from each of the edges of the document, as shown in the following screenshot, you 
can hover over the guide line; when it turns red, double-click to bring up the dialog 
box to make sure the measurement is set at one-eighth of an inch. Now all of the 
space in the box is considered safe for design and will not be cut off during the print 
production of the postcards.
Again, we will continue to work with this file in the following exercise. Keep it open and 
ready for us to continue manipulating the file.
Have a go hero – adding a print bleed
What if you needed to adjust the postcard size to accommodate a bleed of the margins? 
A bleed means when an image or element on a page touches the edge of the page, often 
extending beyond the trim edge so there is no margin. Bleeds can extend off one or more 
sides of a page.
Let's begin with our print-ready postcard file from the previous section.
1.	 Open our 7 X 5 postcard file with the guides in place (if it is not already open from 
the last exercise).
2.	 From the main menu, choose Extensions | Render | Printing Marks. This will add 
crop and bleed marks with a specified bleed area to our canvas.
3.	 Create new guides (while leaving our previously created print-safe guides as is)  
that match the distance of the bleed marks (dotted marks).

How to Manage Files
[ 44 ]
4.	 Now when you design, they can bleed past the Print Safe Area, so they bleed to the 
edge of the paper when cut.
Saving Inkscape files
As you begin working on your projects, it is always good practice to save files often. Inkscape 
has a number of save options, in a number of formats, as well as ways to export into other 
common file formats.
By default, Inkscape typically saves files to your main documents folder. However, you are 
given an option to change this during the saving process each and every time you save a file. 
Saving in Inkscape SVG
By default, Inkscape files are saved as SVG files. The native Inkscape SVG format allows 
editing at a later time. If file size is a concern, you can also save in the Inkscape-compressed 
format of SVGZ and you will have no issues editing the file and resaving it for future use.
Inkscape can save as SVG, SVGZ, PDF, PostScript/EPS/EPSi, Adobe Illustrator (*.ai), LaTex 
(*.tex), POVRay (*.pov), HPGL, and others. This is important because you can share files 
with others, which they are able to then open and manipulate.
If you work in web design, note that it is possible that you can use the SVG files directly in 
the HTML/XML code. However, you should work with your programming team to confirm 
that they can use the SVG format. (Not all browsers or platforms support this).
Saving a file in any other non-Inkscape-SVG-format could potentially make it uneditable to 
the extent of the original. So, always save the native Inkscape document and then export 
bitmaps and other graphics and/or use File | Save Copy As to save it in another format.

Chapter 3
[ 45 ]
Time for action – saving an Inkscape SVG
Since you have just started using Inkscape, let's use an example file to learn about the save 
features of Inkscape. Open your browser and go to the following link:
http://www.openclipart.org/people/kuba/LGM_poster2.svg
Right-click on the image and select Save As. When prompted, save the file to a location on 
your computer (for example, your desktop). We will use this OpenClip Art Inkscape file for 
this exercise:
1.	 Open the example file in Inkscape.
2.	 Once open, from the main menu, select File | Save.
3.	 In the Select file to save to window, type a new name for your file (for example, 
drawing.svg).
4.	 Choose a folder to save the file to—including choosing Browse for other folders  
if you'd like to choose another location.

How to Manage Files
[ 46 ]
5.	 Again, note, by default the file will be saved as Inkscape SVG (*.svg), but there are a 
number of other formats to choose from in this menu. However, as stated, you may 
lose editability of the file once saved in another non-SVG format.
6.	 Click Save.
What just happened?
We just saved our current working file as an Inkscape (editable) SVG file—the native file 
format of Inkscape—to a specified location on our computer for future use.
Pop quiz – editable Inkscape file formats
1.	 What is the native or default Inkscape file format?
a.	 VGS
b.	 SVG
c.	
PNG
d.	 PDF

Chapter 3
[ 47 ]
Exporting files
Inkscape's Export Bitmap option only allows you to export to Portable Network Graphics 
(PNG). This is an image format that uses lossless data compression.
However, there are a number of exporting options that are available.


Exporting a page: Exporting the page (the bordered area) in PNG format is useful 
when the client wants to see a mockup of the final design for review comments or 
approvals—especially in web design. Mockups or wireframes allow someone to see 
a layout without having a need to interact with a live website.


Exporting a drawing: This will export all objects in a drawing, including those placed 
outside the page (bordered area).


Exporting a selection: If you have an object selected on or off the canvas, and 
choose this option, it will be saved as a PNG file. This is most useful for elements  
of a web design such as logos, wordmarks, and various other web graphics.
Time for action – exporting to PNG
Let's give this Export functionality a try. We'll use the postcard file we created in the previous 
section with a very simple design added to show how this is done.
1.	 With the postcard file open from the previous section, from the main menu, select 
File | Export Bitmap.

How to Manage Files
[ 48 ]
2.	 The Export Window is displayed, as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 On this window, you will see a number of options along the top that detail how you 
might want to export the screen contents.
4.	 If you want to export the entire document, as shown in one bitmap image, then 
select Page.
5.	 If you want to export all objects in a drawing, including those placed outside the 
canvas/page, select Drawing.
6.	 If you want to export only a selected object (which you would see with an outline 
and nodes on the screen), select Selection. However, this option is only available if 
items are selected in the drawing before you start the export process.
7.	 Click Browse to change the default filename and/or the location where you want the 
file to be saved.
8.	 Click Export.
Your new PNG file is saved. Remember the PNG you exported from these steps won't be 
editable in Inkscape and the layers will not be intact, but you should be able to import it for 
use in another SVG file.
What just happened?
You took a project file and exported it as a PNG file type. This file type is a bitmap or rasterized 
graphic file type that is not editable in Inkscape, but can be imported into Inkscape to be used 
as part of another project.

Chapter 3
[ 49 ]
Pop quiz – Export versus Save As
1.	 If you want to save a file as a PDF in Inkscape, what would you need to do?
a.	 Use the File | Export Bitmap feature.
b.	 Find another program that can open SVG files to do it for you.
c.	
Use File | Save or File| Save As.
Have a go hero – saving your Inkscape file as a PDF
Since we have discussed PDF files and their importance for mockups as well as transferability 
between compatible software, let's learn how to save an Inkscape file as a PDF for this same 
purpose. PDF file sizes can typically be small and they can be opened by many programs 
(that are not graphics-based). In fact, you can even use PDFs for print projects or simple 
review files.
1.	 With Inkscape open and the postcard file active, from the main menu, select  
File | Save.
2.	 In the Select file to save to window, choose Portable Document Format (*pdf)  
as the file format.
3.	 In the Name field, type a name for your file (for example, postcard.pdf).
4.	 Choose a folder to save the file to—including choosing Browse for other folders,  
if you'd like to choose another location.
5.	 Click Save.
Creating a customized default document
When working in print design, often you might need to create a particular size document 
again and again. Perhaps, Inkscape does not offer this as a default size. You can then create  
a custom document and force Inkscape to use it as the default document size.

How to Manage Files
[ 50 ]
Time for action – creating a new default document
We're going to create a new default document with a custom size.
1.	 From the Inkscape main menu, select File | New | Default. This opens a file with the 
default dimensions of A4, as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Now customize those document dimensions. From the main menu, choose File | 
Document Properties. You'll see the Document Properties window displayed, as 
shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
[ 51 ]
3.	 Change the Units to in (Inches), Width to 7, and Height to 5. The changes on the 
Document Properties window should look similar to the following screenshot:
Remember to change the Units first; otherwise the Width and Height fields will 
adjust to the new unit of measurement and you will have to readjust them.
4.	 Close the Document Properties window/dock by clicking the X at the  
upper-right corner.
5.	 From the main menu, select File | Save As. Choose the following directories to save 
as a new default:
For Windows, save to the share directory within the Inkscape directory.  
C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\default.svg
For Mac and Linux users, save the file to: /usr/share/inkscape/templates/
default.svg
6.	 Once saved, when you open a new Inkscape document and choose File | New | 
Default, a document with your specific dimensions will be opened.
What just happened?
We created a new default document in Inkscape and then saved it so that it will 
automatically open when you choose Default from the new file menu.
How to structure project files
The last section was about saving individual files. However, you may find yourself designing 
entire web pages or large projects that require more than one Inkscape file. To do this, it 
requires some basic organization of files within directories or folders to make finding (and 
using) the Inkscape files easier to use—specifically when saving entire pages of content as 
individual graphic files. The following section details how best to manage multiple file projects.

How to Manage Files
[ 52 ]
Managing multiple file projects
Simply put, if you create one directory or folder where you store all of the files for one 
project, you can minimize mismanagement of files. Within that directory, you will have  
more control over how you structure your files for revisions and drafts for work.
As stated, it starts with a project folder placed on your computer in an easy-to-access 
location. Whenever you create a new file in Inkscape for this project, you can save those 
source Inkscape files in a folder named Source. Then you can also create a Deployment 
folder (or another intuitive name) where you export all the files in the various formats you 
need to hand off to a developer for website integration or as print-ready files for a printer.
This can get a bit complicated when you decide to save all selected files on a page as individual 
images. Inkscape allows you to do what is called a batch save process. This means you save all 
the files with just one button press. Where it gets tricky is the save location and thus it is good 
practice to have directories in which to save files. Let's see how this is done.
Time for action – exporting a batch of images
We're going to look in detail at how to save an entire page or canvas of images as separate 
graphic files. This practice is common in web design when each image needs to be called to 
action in the HTML code. It can also be useful if you have developed a print design and want 
to save a logo, a block of text, and some graphical elements for use in another piece of the 
same client.

Chapter 3
[ 53 ]
1.	 We will use the sample file from the previous section again for this exercise. If you 
have not downloaded the file, open your browser and go to the following link:
http://www.openclipart.org/people/kuba/LGM_poster2.svg
Right-click the image and save to a location on your computer.
2.	 Open the example file in Inkscape.
3.	 On the main menu, select Edit | Select All in All Layers. Now all the objects  
within this example file will be selected. You should see dashed borders around  
each object.
We will discuss Layers in detail in Chapter 5, Working with 
Layers.
4.	 It's time to export. From the main menu, select File | Export Bitmap.
The Export Bitmap window displays.
5.	 This time, we want to choose Selection from the top bar.
6.	 In the Filename field, type the directory folder that you want all object images to be 
saved to. If you choose to browse to a directory, you may need to select a file for the 
path to be accepted in this field.

How to Manage Files
[ 54 ]
7.	 Enable the Batch export 8 selected objects checkbox.
8.	 Click Export.
What just happened?
With a few simple steps in the Export Bitmap window, you were able to save eight objects  
as separate PNG files in a specified directory.
Inkscape uses object IDs when automatically assigning filenames during an export.  
The object IDs, by default, aren't descriptive and are often a basic description of the  
object with a number. However, you can rename the object ID on your canvas easily.
Renaming object IDs
In an open Inkscape document, select the object you want to rename. From the main menu, 
select Object | Object Properties (or use the Shift + Ctrl + O keyboard shortcut key). The 
Object Properties window is displayed. Change the Id field to be a descriptive filename.

Chapter 3
[ 55 ]
Now when you export, the filename will be pulled from this Id field and thus be descriptive 
in nature for your project.
Importing non-native Inkscape files
In the previous section, we imported a previously-created Inkscape SVG file into the program. 
Inkscape supports a number of other graphic formats too. It can open or import SVG, SVGZ 
(gzipped SVG), PDF, and AI (Adobe Illustrator) formats. In particular, it can import bitmap-based 
graphic formats such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF, but it can only export PNG bitmaps.
With the help of extensions and plugins, Inkscape can also open a number of other vector 
formats. The following are some examples:


For importing PostScript or EPS, install Ghostscript (http://pages.cs.wisc.
edu/~ghost/)


For formats of Dia, XFig, or Sketch, you need to have those programs installed on 
your computer


For CorelDraw, CGM, and SK1 files, install Uniconverter (http://sk1project.
org/). For Windows users, Uniconvertor is pre-installed with Inkscape and no 
additional installation is needed.
See this version of the Inkscape manual for the fully-supported formats and the caveats of 
importing each: http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/File-Import.
html.
Remember, if you import and open a non-native Inkscape file, you may not be able edit  
all of the elements. Inkscape imports non-native files as flattened graphic files, so you  
can't edit anything within the graphic, but you can manipulate or use the flattened image 
within Inkscape.
The recommended format for transferring non-native Inkscape files is to use 
the original source program and files to create a PDF. Then open the PDF in 
Inkscape. PDF files, when imported into Inkscape, allow for editability to remain 
with vector-based objects.

How to Manage Files
[ 56 ]
Time for action – importing a PDF into Inkscape
Let's import a non-native Inkscape SVG file into Inkscape—as you may need to do this for 
client logos, photographs, and any number of other real-world examples. Open a browser 
and go to this link: http://db.tt/xR0ZlBRL
A PDF will be downloaded and saved to your computer. It will be our sample file to work  
with during this exercise.
1.	 Open a document in Inkscape. This can be any in-progress file that we have used 
previously in this chapter, or a new document.
2.	 From the main menu, select File | Import.
The Select file to import window displays, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
[ 57 ]
3.	 Locate and select the sample PDF file you just downloaded and select Open.
4.	 When the PDF Import Settings screen displays, adjust settings as needed  
and click OK.
5.	 Within Page settings, you can choose whether you want all pages of the PDF to be 
imported or just a specific page number. The Clip to field has various options (media 
box, crop box, trim box, bleed box, art box, and so on), allowing you to determine 
how the file is imported into your current canvas.
6.	 Within Import settings, you can set the Precision of Gradient Meshes. Any gradients 
seen on your objects are converted to tiny boxes. The higher the precision, the more 
boxes will be used to illustrate the gradient (also, the larger the file size, the slower 
the load time in Inkscape).
7.	 Depending on the source application that created the PDF, you can adjust Text 
handling. If you choose Import text as text, all the text objects will be brought  
in as such in Inkscape and then become editable.
8.	 The checkboxes on the screen allow for you to replace fonts to the closest match 
(checked) and to embed images (checked).
9.	 In a few moments, the PDF file you selected will display within the page of your 
Inkscape project.

How to Manage Files
[ 58 ]
Note that this imported PDF is fully editable if the objects are vector-based. Rasterized 
images are more limited to the following:


Moving the object: Click to select it and move it to where you want it to be on  
the canvas.


Making the image smaller: Double-click the object to select and click-and-drag an 
arrowed corner to shrink it.
Any detailed edits such as changing color or moving lines within the PDF are not permissible. 
However, the object is fully usable within the Inkscape file for design purposes. Photographs 
and similar rasterized images can all be used in this fashion.
Edit text blocks
To edit an imported block of text like a typewriter, select the text block 
and Remove Manual Kerns from the Text Menu.
What just happened?
We imported a sample PDF file into Inkscape to demonstrate the flexibility of this file format. 
If objects are vector-based, they maintain editability. If rasterized images are included, then 
they have more limited editing capabilities.

When you import files into Inkscape, you are prompted about linking or embedding them. 
Linking a file means that the file is essentially displayed within your Inkscape document and 
there are associated properties (location, size, and so on) to that linked object. The original file 
must remain in the exact location on your computer or you will not be able to view it in the 
Inkscape file and any changes you make to the original file will be seen in the Inkscape file.

Chapter 3
[ 59 ]
Embedding a file means that the file itself is brought into the Inkscape document and it 
resides there. All changes made to that file within your project stay within your project  
and the original source file can be moved to any location on your computer.
The advantage to embedding images is that they are not tied to the original source.  
You can move the source file or the Inkscape file anywhere on your computer or even  
send a co-worker the Inkscape file and there is no need to worry about the linked file. 
However, this also means your file sizes will be larger.
There are some limitations to embedding images into the Inkscape SVG files. They are  
as follows:


For SVG files used directly on the web, increasing the file size increases bandwidth 
usage on the server or host.


Embedded images can't be shared across documents. For example, if you have one 
PNG image as a background file, you can't share it across SVG files.


Sharing copyrighted fonts or images in a document could be illegal (depending on 
how extensive the rights you have purchased to use these items are to begin with). 
This is particularly important when working on commercial or widely-used projects.


If there is extensive text editing within the SVG files themselves, this can be 
complicated and time-intensive.
Linking keeps file sizes small, but you must remember to send all additional files along with 
your Inkscape SVG files when you go to production or create print-ready PDFs; otherwise all 
linked objects will not display.
Embedding files in Inkscape
The best examples for embedding files in Inkscape are when you want one all-inclusive file 
that can be sent or posted individually without worrying about additional source files or 
directory structures. Another example could be when you know that you will change the 
location of the linked or Inkscape file frequently, as you work with different versions.

Pop quiz – linking versus embedding images
1.	 Why would you want to link an external file instead of an embedded one?
a.	 A large image size
b.	 The image will be constantly changing and you want the changes to be 
reflected instantly in your Inkscape file
c.	
Project file structure will remain the same and there are a limited number 
of images
d.	 All of the above
Have a go hero – changing your mind, embedding files after the fact
What if you initially linked all files and then decide that you would rather embed them all? 
The following are the steps to take to make this happen:
1.	 Open an Inkscape document.
2.	 From the main menu, select Extensions, then Images, and Embed Images....
3.	 Do not check the Embed only selected images box.

Chapter 3
[ 63 ]
If you want to embed only certain images in the document, then you 
must select those images first. You should then go to the main menu, 
select Extensions | Images | Embed Images..., and check the Embed 
only selected images box.
4.	 Click Apply.
Summary
We spent the majority of this chapter discussing how to create new files in Inkscape. You 
learned how to use predefined page/canvas sizes in Inkscape, how to customize the file size, 
and even how to create print bleeds and the setup for print-safe space on your documents.
Then we jumped into saving Inkscape files—paying close attention to discuss the advantages 
of keeping a source version of all documents in Inkscape's native file format of SVG, so you 
can continue to edit your files. Along with that topic, we jumped into managing multiple 
file projects and best practices, the details regarding which formats in which Inkscape can 
save, as well as importing file types. Finally, we talked about embedding and linking files 
and images in your Inkscape files. We detailed the advantages and disadvantages of each 
approach as well as how to work with both in your files for the best experience.
All of this is leading up to the next chapter, which deals with starting your very first Inkscape 
project. We've done a lot of preparation; now it is time to start designing!

Creating your First Graphics
We're now ready to create some graphics. We'll start with some basic shapes 
and then move on to freehand objects, using grids and guidelines to help to 
create better graphics better create graphics.
The following are the specifics about what we will learn:

Ellipses and Arcs


Complex Shapes


Using Grids and Guidelines
Paths
Vector graphics are made up of what are called geometrical primitives such as points, lines, 
curves, and shapes. These primitives then have a start and end point, curves, angles, and 
points that are calculated with a mathematical equation. These paths are not limited to being 
straight—they can be of any shape, size, and even encompass any number of curves. When 
you combine them, they create drawings, diagrams, and can even help create certain fonts.

Creating your First Graphics
[ 66 ]
Inkscape uses both paths and a series of pre-determined shapes when creating graphics. 
Paths have no predefined lengths or widths. They are arbitrary in nature and come in three 
basic types:


Open paths (have two ends)


Closed paths (have no ends, like a circle)


Compound paths (use a combination of two or more open and/or closed paths)
Closed
Open
Compound
In Inkscape, there are a few ways we can make paths such as with the Pencil (Freehand), 
Bezier (Pen) , and Calligraphy tools—all of which are found in the toolbox located at the left 
side of your screen.
You can also convert a regular shape or text object into a path.

Chapter 4
[ 67 ]
In general, we use paths to build unique objects that aren't part of the SVG standard shapes 
in Inkscape. Since we can combine paths and make them closed objects—they again can be 
resized, manipulated, and then exported in a number of formats.
Creating your first vector graphic
In this section, we will show you how to create some basic vector graphics with shapes and 
paths in Inkscape (which thankfully doesn't require you to do any mathematical equations 
when using it) and export them in a couple of different formats.
Here are the standard shapes that are part of the SVG standard:


Rectangles, squares, and 3D boxes


Circles, ellipses, and arcs


Stars and polygons


Spirals
Creating a polygon
Let's break down creating our first graphic—a star—into many smaller substeps just to get 
started. We will do the following:


Open a new document


Create the polygon object


Change the object properties


Save our graphic
Let's get started!
Time for action – opening a new document
When you first open Inkscape, a new document is opened and you are ready to start. 
However, it uses a default canvas size of A4 and you may need to change the orientation  
and size for the graphic you are creating, as follows:
1.	 Open Inkscape.
2.	 If you need to create a new document, go to File | New. A menu appears with the 
predefined sizes Inkscape has for you.

Creating your First Graphics
[ 68 ]
3.	 If you want to manually change your document properties, just go to the main 
menu and select File | Document Properties. You will see the Document Properties 
window displayed with a number of options for customizing your canvas size.
4.	 If you want to change the default background color (default in Inkscape is a 
transparent background), you change it in the General, Background section.  
Click the color swatch to change it.
5.	 If you want to adjust any Border settings, check the appropriate checkboxes.  
The options include:


Showing a page border


Showing the border on top of any objects on the canvas


Showing a border shadow
6.	 When complete, close the Document Properties window by clicking the X in the 
upper-left corner and your changes will be reflected in the main window.

Chapter 4
[ 69 ]
What just happened?
We opened Inkscape and adjusted the canvas size for your graphic. We also discussed 
additional document properties that can be changed such as background color, page  
border options, and border shadows.
Pop quiz – displaying borders
1.	 Why might it be important to have borders show on top of your drawing objects?
a.	 If you are using page borders as cropping/print guidelines, you know where 
the final paper will be cut
b.	 It isn't important at all
c.	
Gives great artistic flare to the graphic
Time for action – creating a star
Now, we will create a shape that is a part of the SVG standard that is inherent in Inkscape. 
These standard shapes include rectangles/squares, circles/ellipses/arcs, stars, polygons,  
and spirals. We will create a star. Here's what you need to do:
1.	 Select (click) the shape tool icon (A) and the polygon icon (B) in the toolbox,  
as highlighted in the following screenshot.
2.	 Then draw the shape on the canvas by clicking, holding, and then dragging the 
shape to the size you want on the canvas:

Creating your First Graphics
[ 70 ]
3.	 To switch between creating stars and polygons, select the star/polygon icon in the 
toolbox on the left-hand side of your screen, and then select either the polygon or 
the star icon in the Tool controls (just above the canvas).
4.	 You can also change the number of corners this polygon has by changing the 
number in the Corners field in the Tool controls.
If you had wanted to draw a circle, square, or cube—you would have selected those icons on 
the toolbox.
It is possible that your star doesn't match the one shown in the preceding screenshot. 
Maybe your color or border is different. That is because, when you opened Inkscape, your 
color palette settings were set to the last used style. The Have a go Hero – changing the unit 
of measure, section explains how to change those settings—Fill and Stroke—so your star can 
look similar to the example.
What just happened?
You created a star object on your blank canvas.
Pop quiz – switching shapes
1.	 What if you decided instead of a star, you would like to draw a cube. In which screen 
toolbar would you look for the correct tool?
a.	 Palette bar
b.	 Tool controls
c.	
Toolbox
d.	 Object dialog
Have a go hero – changing shape options
Shapes have a number of attributes or options. By default those attributes will be the  
last-used style (for example, color). In Inkscape, the user interface gives you easy-to-use  
tools to change options such as fill color, stroke color, size, and placement of the shape.

Chapter 4
[ 71 ]
1.	 Change the fill color of the shape by selecting a color in the color palette.
2.	 Change the stroke or border color by pressing and holding the Shift key and then 
selecting that color from the color palette.
3.	 Change the position of the shape on the canvas by choosing the Select tool in the 
toolbox, clicking and holding the shape, and moving it to where you need it to be.
4.	 Change the size of the shape by also choosing the Select tool from the toolbox, 
clicking and holding the edge of the shape at the handles (small black square or 
circles at the edges), and dragging it outwards to make it larger or inwards to shrink 
until the shape is of the desired size.
The shape is still fully editable and the number of tips in the star is adjusted through 
the tool controls bar. You can also switch between polygon and stars.

Creating your First Graphics
[ 72 ]
Time for action – saving your graphic
After you have created an initial version of your graphic, it is best practice to save your file so 
that you don't lose any work. This is a simple example graphic, so you may not want to save 
the file, but for any future work, this step is critical.
1.	 With your latest project open, from the main menu select File | Save. Inkscape will, 
by default, give options to save projects in its default format, SVG. Choose a file 
location and click Save.
2.	 However, you might also want to export in a bitmap graphic format such as PNG.  
To do this, choose File | Export Bitmap.

Chapter 4
[ 73 ]
3.	 In the Export Bitmap window, you can choose to save the Page (all objects within 
the page/black border, the Drawing (all objects), the Selection (only the object you 
have selected), or customize it.
4.	 Choose the Export area, the graphic size you want (will select predefined size by 
default), and click Browse to choose the same location.
5.	 Verify the filename in the textbox and click Export.
6.	 To save in another format besides PNG, go to File | Save As and choose the file 
format of your choice. Inkscape allows you to save in a number of formats such as 
PDF, EPS, ODG, WMF, among others. However, remember that if you want to save 
the file in a format that will allow you to edit in the future, you need to save it in 
Inkscape SVG.
What just happened?
You saved your graphics file as a native Inkscape SVG file so you can edit it later, and then 
exported it into another format (as needed).

Creating your First Graphics

Pop quiz – image formats	
1.	 What is the only bitmap format that Inkscape can export to?
a.	 JPG
b.	 GIF
c.	
BMP
d.	 PNG
Creating ellipses and arcs
Now, we're going to get a bit fancier and create ellipses and arcs. Ellipses are of oval shape. 
To start, we will create an ellipse and explain how to make perfect circles and then details 
about creating an arc.
Time for action – creating the Ellipse
Let's start by creating an ellipse.
1.	 With a new document open in Inkscape, select the circle tool or ellipse tool.
2.	 On the canvas, press the Ctrl key, click, hold, and drag the shape to the size you want 
on the canvas.

Chapter 4
[ 75 ]
What just happened?
You created a circle on your canvas.
Pop quiz – circles
1.	 How can you make a perfect circle in Inkscape?
a.	 Freehand it with the freehand tool.
b.	 Use a star and clipping masks.
c.	
Use the circle tool in the toolbox and press the Ctrl key while resizing it.
d.	 None of the above.
Time for action – making an arc
Now, we will take our circle and convert it into an arc.
1.	 Make sure that the Circle/Ellipse tool is still selected and you can see the handles on 
the shape on the canvas.
Notice, there are three handles which are top (square), left (square), and right 
(circle). To control the horizontal and vertical dimensions, you use the top 
(horizontal) and left (vertical) handles.
Dragging the right circle handle of a whole ellipse creates an arc or segment.
To switch between an arc or pie segment, drag the handle inside or outside of the 
ellipse. Let's give it a try.

Creating your First Graphics
[ 76 ]
2.	 Drag an arc handle (the circle one) to set one end of the arc. Once you pull or drag 
one of the arc handles, you will see that there are actually two overlapping arc 
handles for you to manipulate. (as shown in the following screenshot, this is  
now a closed path).
Drag the second arc handle (in the original position) to the other end of the arc,  
The arc will be closed and a pie shape will be created (an open path).
3.	 Hold the Ctrl key while dragging an arc handle to force the angle of the arc to begin 
or end at a multiple of the rotation snap angle (15 degrees by default). To precisely 
place objects on the canvas, an object is made to snap to a target that is an object, 
guide, grid, or in this case an angle. Drag one of the arc handles outside the curve  
of the original ellipse (outside the dashed box); the arc handle icon turns blue and  
a wedge is created at the center of the shape (again, a closed path).

Chapter 4
[ 77 ]
4.	 If the arc handle is dragged with the cursor inside the curve, the segment defining 
the arc starts and stops at the two arc handles, as shown in the following screenshot 
(now an open path).
5.	 Once the arc is created and selected on the canvas, you can use the Tool controls 
bar to set specific locations (in degrees) for the start and stop arc handles.

Creating your First Graphics
[ 78 ]
Also, note in the toolbar, the buttons that can quickly change an ellipse into a 
closed path or an open path. The one selected in the preceding screenshot is an 
open path; whereas the one to the left is a closed path.
The full circle button resets the ellipse to whole. When creating ellipses, the 
next one you create will use the last used style (for example, after this exercise it 
would be an arc). The Reset ellipse button will then become handy to start anew.
What just happened?
You took a simple circle and created a number of arcs—essentially learning the skills that you 
need to manipulate arcs in Inkscape.
Complex Shapes
As a designer you will often want to create logos or shapes that are outside the standard 
ones provided in the software. Since Inkscape is vector-based, you can combine simple 
shapes, masking, hiding, and layering them to create more complex shapes. Let's perform  
a simple example to see how this can be done.
Time for action – combining shapes
One of the simplest ways to create complex shapes in Inkscape is to combine other shapes 
into one or merge the shapes. Let's learn how we can do this by creating an arrow with  
a polygon and rectangle shape.
1.	 Open a new document (any size will do, since we are just practicing).
2.	 Select the Polygon tool from the toolbox.
3.	 Create a polygon shape.

Chapter 4
[ 79 ]
4.	 From the Tool controls, change Corners to 3, as shown in the following screenshot:
The octagon polygon shape changes to a triangle.
5.	 From the toolbox, choose the Select tool and click the triangle object twice.  
The handles turn to curved arrows so you can rotate the triangle as shown  
in the following screenshot:

Creating your First Graphics
[ 80 ]
Rotating an object
While drawing the polygon on the canvas, you can swivel it up, down, 
left, and right. Use the Ctrl key while performing the following actions 
and it will make rotations snap in 15 degree increments.
It is okay if you don't do this while drawing it initially, you can always 
choose the Select tool from the toolbox, and click the polygon until 
the handles turn to arrows with curves (this might require you to click 
the polygon object a couple of times). When you see the curved arrow 
handles, click-and-drag on a corner node to rotate the object until it is 
positioned correctly.
6.	 From the toolbox, select the rectangle tool and draw a rectangle just below the 
triangle on the canvas.
7.	 Now, choose the Select tool from the toolbox, and drag the rectangle so it creates 
the stem of the arrow as follows:

Chapter 4
[ 81 ]
8.	 To readjust the size of the rectangle, make sure the Select tool is active, and click 
the rectangle. The resize handles appear. Click the handle on a side that needs to be 
adjusted and drag it to resize.
9.	 With the rectangle still selected, press and hold the Shift key, and click the triangle 
so that all objects are selected.
10.	From the main menu select Path | Union:
This merges the two shapes into one... and voila, it's an arrow!

Creating your First Graphics
[ 82 ]
What just happened?
You created a polygon, changed the number of corners, created a rectangle and combined 
them—or joined them—into a union to create an arrow object. Technically, the shapes were 
transformed into a path. The shape tools no longer work on this object and it is its own 
object in Inkscape that can be resized and manipulated like any other object.
Pop quiz – joining objects	
1.	 How do you join more than one shape in Inkscape?
a.	 Select all the objects you want to join together and then on the main menu 
select Path | Union.
b.	 You can't.
c.	
You have to draw an object freehand.
Freehand objects (Paths)
You can also use the Bezier (Pen) or Freehand Tool to create objects in a bit more freehand 
form. This tool allows you to create straight lines and curves and connect them to create a 
freehand object.
Time for action – creating a freehand object
Here's an example of how to create a lightning bolt.
1.	 From a new document, choose the Bezier tool from the Tool Box.
2.	 Click somewhere on the canvas to start drawing a straight line, click to establish a 
node, click again to change direction of the straight line to create an angle in our 
lightning bolt, as shown in the following screenshots:

Chapter 4
[ 83 ]
3.	 Continue to create the lightning bolt object by creating the shape segment  
by segment.
Don't worry if you stop a line and realize you need to extend its 
length, just click and move a straight line to add on to the original 
to make it as long as you need. Click again when you are ready to 
change direction. If you made a mistake, press the Backspace or 
Delete key and it removes the last line segment.
4.	 To close the lightning bolt, just create a line segment and join it to the starting point 
with a final click. The start node will glow red in color when the mouse is hovered 
over it for easy identification. This is helpful to make sure that the close of the object 
is done correctly. You will see that all the lines are combined into one continuous 
closed path—a lightning bolt.

Creating your First Graphics
[ 84 ]
When you select the lightning bolt, the entire object is selected. You can resize it, fill 
it with a color (select it and choose a color from the color palette), and move it to 
another location on the canvas. It has become a unique object for you to work with.
The Bezier tool also allows you to create controlled curves to create even more 
complex and unique objects. Try creating objects on your own and experimenting. 
These complex objects can be used for icons, banners, and for unique logo designs.
What just happened?
You used the Bezier tool and created, in multiple small steps, a lightning bolt.
Pop quiz – deleting	
1.	 What are the important keys to remember if you want to delete the last line you 
drew with the Bezier Tool?
a.	 D key
b.	 Shift key
c.	
Enter key
d.	 Backspace or Delete key 
Using grids and guidelines
When designing, we often need to align objects for a clean look. To do this, grids can be used 
to help in alignment. We will start this section by learning how to turn the canvas grid on, set 
up snap to alignment, and then how to set up guidelines.
Time for action – viewing the Grid
We will start with the easiest task, turning the Grid on (or making it viewable).
1.	 With your new document still open on your computer, on the Inkscape main menu 
select View | Grid:

Chapter 4
[ 85 ]
What just happened?
You'll see that a blue grid will appear across the entire canvas area. We will use these  
grids to create basic areas of our layout and then create guides to begin creating our  
actual layout elements.

Creating your First Graphics
[ 86 ]
Have a go hero – changing the unit of measure
By default, Inkscape keeps all dimensions—even the unit of measure—in pixels. Do you want 
your grid to be in inches? There is an easy way to do this.
1.	 Go to the main menu, choose File | Document Properties. You'll see the Document 
Properties window displayed.
2.	 Change the Units field to in (Inches). This will change the grid, the canvas 
dimensions, and all units of measure to inches in this document.

Chapter 4
[ 87 ]
Pop quiz – viewable grid
1.	 What is the shortcut key for making Grids viewable in Inkscape?
a.	 The G key
b.	 F1
c.	
#
d.	 Enter
Time for action – making guides
Now it's time to create guides. Guides are lines on the screen that you will use for aligning, 
that is, guiding objects. These lines are only visible while you are working in Inkscape and we 
can set objects to snap to them when we are designing. Both of these simple tools (guides 
and the Snap to feature) will give you automatic alignment for the basic areas of your web 
page layout—which in turn will help make the design process much easier.
1.	 To create a guide in any open document, drag from the left or top ruler toward your 
page as in the following screenshot. A red line represents the guide until you let go 
of the guide and place it on the page. Then the line turns blue.

Creating your First Graphics
[ 88 ]
You can move the guides after placing them on the page by using the Select tool and 
clicking-and-dragging the circle node on the guide. Also, double-clicking directly on a 
guide will bring up a dialog box which lets you change the guide positions and angle 
very accurately.
What just happened?
You created two guidelines on your current canvas: one from the right ruler and one from 
the top.
One note here, if you want to make multiple guidelines, even on the right 
side of the canvas, it is easy. Just drag from the left ruler onto the canvas 
over other guidelines and all rulers currently placed on the page and 
drop it where you need it on the page. There is no maximum number of 
guidelines that you can create.
Summary
We created our very first graphics from polygons, ellipses, circles, arcs, and even an arrow 
by combining shapes. To do all of this, we used the basic shapes available to us through 
Inkscape but also worked with the Bezier Tool to create freehand shapes (such as the 
lightning bolt).
We also took some time to turn on grids and to learn how to create guides for better aligning 
and designing. Next up, we shall be learning all we can about layers.

How to Work with Layers
If you have used any other graphics program, you are likely to be familiar with 
layers. Layers are like stacks of transparent paper with drawings on them. Each 
layer stacks, and thus objects on each of the layers also stack on top of one 
another. Of course when using layers in Inkscape, you can manipulate all of the 
objects in one layer the same way.

[ 90 ]
Defining layers and how to create them
Within Inkscape when you create documents you can have layers of objects. This gives great 
flexibility when creating any Inkscape project. You can place groups of objects on a layer 
based on function or placement on the design. Then you can separate the objects by layer, 
and stack or reorder, or hide layers. A setting can be adjusted on each layer, so you can save 
drafts or different versions of mockups and keep all of this in one file.
The layer you are currently using is called the drawing layer. It is selected in the Layer dialog 
and shown in a darker color.
Also note, you can view Inkscape layers in the Layer dialog or in a drop-down menu in the 
status bar:

Chapter 5
[ 91 ]
Time for action – creating a layer
Let's start by creating a customized layer. We'll call it Basic Layout.
1.	 First, let's make the Layers dockable dialog viewable. From the main menu, select 
Layer and then select Layers. The Layers dialog is displayed on the right-hand side  
of your screen as follows:
You can also press Shift + Ctrl + L on your keyboard or click the Layers 
icon in the command bar (as shown in the following screenshot) to 
display the Layers dialog.

2.	 In the Layers dialog, press the + button to create a new layer or use the Shift + Ctrl 
+ N shortcut keys. The default layer is called Layer 1. However, you can rename it, 
move it up and down in the stack, and it is treated no different than any other layer 
you create in your projects.
3.	 In the Layer name field, type the name: Basic Layout and click Add:
You will notice the new layer is added above the existing one in the Layers dialog  
as follows:
What just happened?
You created a new layer in an open document in Inkscape called Basic Layout. You will need 
to repeat the steps mentioned earlier every time you want to create a new layer.
Pop quiz – Layers dialog
1.	 How do you close the Layers dialog?
a.	 From the main menu, select Layer and then select Layers.
b.	 Press the X on the upper-right side of the Layers dialog window.

Chapter 5
[ 93 ]
c.	
Once it is open, you cannot close the Layers dialog window.
d.	 Close Inkscape all together and re-open it.
Using Layers in an example drawing
Let's create the basic links for a blog. Some common parts of many blog sites are the blog 
header or banner, a sidebar with recent posts (or archives), an about section, recent posts, 
blog roll and/or a Links section, and a main content section that will contain all of the blog 
posts. Of course, you can get as fancy as you like here, or as simple, but let's design a site 
based on these simple sections so we can demonstrate how to use layers to create a design 
layout mockup.
Time for action – using Layers in web design
To start, we will create the very start of a website, or more specifically a blog, and create 
three layers in the design:
1.	 Open Inkscape, and create a new document. From the file menu, select File | New | 
Desktop_800x600.
2.	 From the main menu, choose File | Document Properties.
3.	 Click on Background. The Background color dialog will be displayed.
4.	 Change RGBA from ffffff00 to ffffffff. This will change the background color of this 
screen mockup to white.

How to Work with Layers
[ 94 ]
5.	 In the Layer dialog, click the + sign to create a new layer (or use Shift + Ctrl + N)  
and call it Header.
6.	 Click the Create and Edit Objects tool and enter the header title for the blog.
You could try creating something similar to the following screenshot:
7.	 Highlight the text with the Create and Edit Objects tool and use the control  
bar located above the canvas area and adjust the font type and size. In the  
previous example, the font type is Arial and it is 36 points in size, as shown  
in the following screemshot:
8.	 Then, still using the Create and Edit tool, type the subtitle as shown in the example. 
Remember to use the control bar to adjust the font type and size. In the same 
(previous) example, the font for the subtitle is Apple Chancery with an 18 point font.
9.	 Next, we want to center both of these titles on the vertical axis of this document. 
Use the Select tool, press the Shift key on the keyboard, and click both titles  
(this will allow you to select both objects).
10.	Click the Align and Distribute Objects icon on the command bar to display the  
Align and Distribute dialog, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
[ 95 ]
11.	Click the Center on Vertical Axis icon. This will center both title objects on the page:
12.	Now we will add a new layer yet again. Create the new layer by using the Layer 
dialog, + sign, or the Shift + Ctrl + N shortcut keys. Let's call the layer Navigation.
13.	For the navigational elements, we will import some ready-made icons. 
First download the icons to your hard drive from http://dl.dropbox.
com/u/565455/iconpack.zip.

How to Work with Layers
[ 96 ]
14.	Unzip these icons to your hard drive, preferably on your desktop. From the desktop 
then drag-and-drop your icon files onto the Inkscape canvas. Repeat this until you 
have all five icons on the canvas. See the following sample screenshot:
15.	To make sure you have everything evenly spaced, we need to align them. Click the 
Align and Distribute Objects icon on the command bar to display the Align and 
Distribute dialog if it is still not displayed.
16.	Choose the Select tool, press the Shift key and click on all icons.
17.	In the Align and Distribute dialog, click the Distribute Centers Equidistantly 
Horizontally button.
This will make sure all of the icons are spaced equally apart from one another  
to make a clean design.
What just happened?
In the small example mentioned earlier, you created three layers: Background, Header, 
and Navigation, each with the object associated with them. If you continue this process, 
you can build something similar to what is given in the following screenshot that has 
additional layers side content, body content, and footer, for example. To see this project 
in its complete form, you can download it from http://dl.dropbox.com/u/565455/
exampleprojectlayout.svg.

Chapter 5
[ 97 ]
Now, let's dig a bit deeper into how you can manipulate layers to help you design. Make each 
layer behave independently of the others and therefore, manipulate what your final design 
will look like.

How to Work with Layers
[ 98 ]
Locking layers
The idea of locking a layer—making it not editable—can be valuable when designing 
backgrounds, footers, or headers.
Time for action – locking a layer
Let's look at how you can lock a layer in Inkscape using the same design used previously. 
You can download the full project from http://dl.dropbox.com/u/565455/
exampleprojectlayout.svg.
1.	 With the blog mockup from the pervious exercise open in Inkscape, open the Layer 
dialog. From the main menu, select Layer and then Layers. On the right side of your 
screen, the Layers dialog will be displayed and it will look something similar to the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 5
[ 99 ]
2.	 You will notice that each layer has icons to the left of the layer name. Go to the 
Background layer and click the Lock icon. You will see that once you click that icon, 
the lock now looks closed or locked, shown as follows:
This means that the Background layer can no longer be selected from the canvas, 
nor will any objects on this layer be able to be moved or edited.
3.	 For example, go to your canvas and try to select the Background objects. You will 
not be able to move this layer until you unlock it in the Layer dialog.
4.	 To unlock an item, click the Lock icon. Again, you will see the icon change to the 
unlock state, opening the layer objects for manipulation again.
What just happened?
In the previous example, we locked the header layer in the working document. This means 
we can't edit any objects on that layer, or move them to a new location on the canvas. 
Essentially, all items are locked into place.
This helps keep items that are "in place," stay in place while you work on the rest of the 
design. This can be especially handy when working in a series of designs where certain  
items will always stay in the same location.
Hiding layers
Another great feature when working with layers is to hide them. This means that while 
working with interim drafts of projects, you could create a layer for the first draft, and then 
another for the second—or you could even use layers for certain design elements that you 
want to turn on or off. All these are beneficial because the layer will hold objects' locations, 
but all you need to do is click a button to turn them on or off.

How to Work with Layers
[ 100 ]
Time for action – hiding layers
To really show how powerful a feature hiding layers can be, let's walk through this example. 
We're going to change the design of the blog that we have been featuring in this entire chapter. 
In fact, we will change the navigation icons so that we can make two different designs:
1.	 With the blog mockup from the previous exercise open in Inkscape, reopen the 
Layer dialog if it is not open.
2.	 Select the Navigation layer.
3.	 Click the Eye icon to the left of the layer name.
4.	 The eye will close and essentially hide all objects on that layer—as shown in the 
previous screenshot.

Chapter 5
[ 101 ]
5.	 Now, you can create a new layer with the different navigation elements and make 
that viewable. This creates another design option to choose from. To do this, create 
the new layer by using the Layer dialog and the + sign or the Shift + Ctrl + N shortcut 
keys. Let's name the layer Navigation Option 2:
6.	 Make sure this layer remains selected and import some new navigational 
elements. Download the new icons from http://dl.dropbox.com/u/565455/
Newnavbuttons.zip.

How to Work with Layers
[ 102 ]
7.	 Unzip the new icons to your desktop and drag-and-drop the files to your canvas 
(again, making sure the Navigation Option 2 layer is active). You'll notice that since 
the original Navigation is still hidden, you don't see the icons:
This is an ideal way to give certain design options to a client.
8.	 You can now save a PDF with the new navigation design. From the main menu, 
select File | Save As | *.Portable Document Format. You can leave all default values 
on in the PDF dialog to save the file.
9.	 Hide the layer Navigation Option 2 (click the eye) and unhide the layer Navigation 
(click closed eye) to see the original design. Then save this version also as a PDF. 
From the main menu, select File | Save As | *.Portable Document Format. Of 
course, remember to give this new version a different PDF filename:
10.	Also, saving this project as an Inkscsape SVG file would be beneficial, so all objects 
and this overall design can be edited later. From the main menu, select File and then 
select Save.

Chapter 5
[ 103 ]
What just happened?
You hid one layer, created another layer, made a new design element, and learned how to 
switch between the two layers to show off two different designs.
In Inkscape, layer selection happens automatically when you select an object. This is 
different in comparison to many bitmap editors in the market, where you first have to select 
a layer to work on and then the object. With Inkscape, you can select any object and it will 
be immediately set as the current layer by Inkscape.
Have a go hero – show all but current layer
You can also hide or show all layers other than the current.
The following points explain how it is done:
1.	 Open the sample file that we created previously.
2.	 In the Layer dialog, right-click the layer name and choose Show/hide other layers.
3.	 If the current layer is viewable (not hidden) it will hide all others except your 
working layer giving you access to that layer's content in isolation.
4.	 If the current layer is hidden, selecting the Show/hide other layers field, will unhide 
the current layer and then hide all others. Again, allowing you to work in only that 
layer with no other layers and their objects viewable.

How to Work with Layers
[ 104 ]
Duplicating layers
Much like hiding layers, it can be very useful to duplicate certain layers so you can keep some 
of the same object attributes as the original (for example, opacity) or for the use of creating 
design mockups of multiple pages of a website, which have common elements. Also note 
that when you duplicate a layer it will duplicate all objects, including hidden or locked ones 
on any sub-layers as well. More information is given in the section Time for action—nesting 
layers later in this chapter in regard to sub-layers.
Time for action – duplicating layers
Here are the simple steps for duplicating a layer. We'll use the same example blog page as we 
have throughout this chapter.
1.	 Open the blog mockup from the previous exercises.
2.	 If your Layer dialog is open, you can right-click any layer and choose Duplicate 
Current Layer.
3.	 Alternatively, make sure the layer you want to duplicate is selected and from the 
main menu, choose Layer and then Duplicate Current Layer.

Chapter 5
[ 105 ]
What just happened?
You have just created a literal duplicate of the layer on your screen to edit.
Note, however, that the duplicate layer is also right above the existing layer, so you may  
not be able to see which is selected. Look at the Layer dialog. It renames the duplicate layer: 
<original layer name> copy.
All objects on that layer are duplicated as well and will be placed on the canvas in the exact 
location of the original. If you move an object, you will see the other one below it.
Now you can move and/or edit objects as needed on this new layer without disturbing  
the original.
Arranging layers
You can also rearrange layers. Let's learn how to re-order the stack of layers, and move  
a layer to the top or bottom.
Time for action – moving layers
We're again going to use our blog design mockup file as an example. As the current screen 
stands, the layers don't overlap much—as all objects have a place. However, if we add a layer 
for a swirled background, it automatically places this layer on top, shown as follows:

How to Work with Layers
[ 106 ]
The following steps explain how to move it down to place it behind the main design:
1.	 Download a sample of the swirl background here: http://dl.dropbox.co/u/565455/
swirlbackground.svg.zip
2.	 In inkscape, in the layer dialog, add a new layer called Swirl Background.
3.	 Select the Swirl Background layer, and from the main menu choose File | Import. 
Select the Swirl Background SVG file. 
4.	 Once the image is imported, select Swirl Background in the Layer dialog and use the 
arrow icon to move this layer just above the Background layer.
5.	 You could also use the move to bottom icon (just to the right of the move down 
icon)—since our background was set to white in the document properties.
Now your canvas should look something similar to the following screenshot.  
Note, how the swirls are now behind the navigational buttons:

Chapter 5
[ 107 ]
6.	 Make sure the Swirl Background layer is selected and move the Opacity bar at 
the bottom of the Layer dialog to 15% (or type 15 in the Opacity field box). The 
opacity of the Swirl Background will change and you will now have a pattern-type 
background for this blog:
What just happened?
We took an additional design element, swirl objects, and made them part of the background 
in our blog design. We did this by creating a new Swirl Background layer and then moving 
that layer lower in the layer stack.
Then we decreased the opacity of that layer to 15 percent, so that it could be subtler in  
the design.
Pop quiz – background colors
1.	 What is the default background color of an Inkscape file?
a.	 White
b.	 Red
c.	
Transparent
d.	 Black

How to Work with Layers
[ 108 ]
Time for action – nesting layers
You also have the option of nesting layers in Inkscape. Nesting is the idea of creating 
sublayers in Inkscape. You might want to do this if you want all sublayers to be virtually 
grouped with a parent layer and carry some of the parent layer's attributes.
Here's how we can create sublayers within the Header layer in our current project:
1.	 With the example project open, go to the Layer dialog (from the main menu,  
select Layer and then Layers or use the Shift + Ctrl + L keyboard shortcut to open it).
2.	 Right-click the Header layer and choose Add Layer....
The Add Layer dialog is displayed.
3.	 Type a new layer name into the Layer name field and then select Position:  
As sublayer of current.
4.	 Click on Add.
5.	 The new sublayer displays as a nested layer beneath Header.

Chapter 5
[ 109 ]
Unfortunately, at this time, there is no way to convert an existing Inkscape 
layer into a sublayer in the graphical interface. You can, however, go into the 
XML editor and make this change directly if needed. More information about 
sublayers can be seen in this online tutorial at http://tavmjong.free.
fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/XML.html.
Also note, a sublayer cannot be moved outside of the parent layer it is under. 
Again, advanced use of the XML editor is needed to do this functionality.
What just happened?
We learned how to create nested sublayers in Inkscape.
Have a go hero – moving objects from one layer to another
Now that you have layers created—and objects on each layer—what if you want to move an 
object from one layer to another? Here's how it is done:
1.	 In an open Inkscape document with multiple layers, select an object.
2.	 If you want to move this object to the layer above the current layer, use Layer | 
Move Selection to Layer Above or the Shift + PageUp keyboard shortcut  
(for Macintosh users the keyboard shortcut is Shift + Fn + Arrow up).
3.	 If you want to move this object to the layer below the current layer, use Layer | 
Move Selection to Layer Below or the Shift + PageDown keyboard shortcut  
(for Macintosh users the keyboard shortcut is Shift + Fn + Arrow down).
Renaming layers
Sometimes while working within a document, you might find the need to rename a layer to a 
more descriptive name to the layer's contents.
Time for action – renaming a layer
The following steps explain how you would rename an existing layer in Inkscape:
1.	 Open an Inkscape document from previous exercises.

How to Work with Layers
[ 110 ]
2.	 If your Layer dialog is open, you can right-click any layer and choose Rename Layer. 
Alternatively, from the main menu, select Layer | Rename Layer....
The Rename Layer dialog is displayed.
3.	 Type a new name for the layer and click Rename, as shown in the  
following screenshot:
What just happened?
We renamed an existing layer in Inkscape to the new name body copy.
Deleting layers
There are also times you might want to delete a layer. Just note that when you delete a layer 
if there are any objects on that layer, they will also be deleted.
Time for action – deleting a layer
1.	 Open an Inkscape document from a previous exercise.
2.	 If your Layer dialog is open, select the Swirl Background layer.
3.	 Then click the – icon as follows:

Chapter 5
[ 111 ]
The selected layer is deleted.
4.	 If you decide you don't want to delete that layer, go to the main menu and  
select Edit | Undo: Delete Layer or use the Ctrl + Z keyboard shortcut to undo  
the last action:
What just happened?
We deleted the layer named Swirl Background in our Inkscape document. We also learned 
that if we want to undo any action, we can use the Undo functionality in Inkscape.
Pop quiz – undo last action
1.	 What is the shortcut key combination to undo the last action in Inkscape?
a.	 Ctrl + Z
b.	 Shift + Z
c.	
Fn + Z
d.	 None of the above

How to Work with Layers
[ 112 ]
Blend mode
In the Layers dialog, you may have noticed the Blend mode field, shown as follows:
 
This field is a shortcut to apply the Blend filter to an entire layer. This means that if any 
objects overlap on the selected layers, Inkscape will do a pixel-by-pixel blend of the two 
objects. Here's what each Blend mode option means:


Normal: No filter added to the layer


Multiply: Objects on the top layer filter the light from the objects on the  
bottom-most layer.  (or from the background if a bottom object does not exist)


Screen: The top objects add light to the bottom object


Darken: The objects on top darken the bottom objects


Lighten: The top objects lighten the bottom objects
If at any time you return the Blend mode back to Normal, the blend filter disappears.
Time for action – using Blend mode
Let's add in a Multiply blend filter to two simple objects as an example:
1.	 Open a new document in Inkscape.
2.	 Use the Circle/Ellipse tool and create one red circle and one yellow circle,  
shown as follows:

Chapter 5
[ 113 ]
3.	 Now move the yellow circle so it overlaps the red circle:
4.	 Open the Layers dialog and go to the Blend mode drop-down menu. Select Multiply 
as follows:
The two objects combine as if light were shining through both. The red and yellow 
objects—where they overlap—display orange, shown as follows:
5.	 If you now change the Blend mode back to Normal, the two objects now go back to 
being normal, or just simply overlapping.

How to Work with Layers
[ 114 ]
What just happened?
We learned how to adjust the Blend mode between layers. We took two example objects 
(circles in this case) and gave them the Multiply blend. Then we learned how to turn the 
blend back to Normal mode.
Summary
We learned essentially everything there is to know about Layers in this chapter. We 
discussed how to create new layers, lock them, hide them, nest sublayers, and even how to 
duplicate and arrange layers. We even spent a bit of time discussing the Blend mode feature 
when using layers—which can be a helpful tool to get text or object effects. Up next, we are 
going to learn about building objects.

Building Objects
This chapter is all about objects. We'll learn about what objects are and how 
Inkscape interprets them, how to change object features, change fill and stroke, 
grouping objects, combining objects, and how to best use the masking and 
clipping features.

Working with objects
Objects in Inkscape are any shapes that make up your overall drawing. This means that any 
text, path, or shape that you create is essentially an object.
Let's start by making a simple object and then changing some of its attributes.

Building Objects
[ 116 ]
Time for action – creating a simple object
Inkscape can create predefined shapes that are part of the SVG standard. These include 
rectangles/squares, circles/ellipses/arcs, stars, polygons, and spirals. To create any of these 
shapes, you can select items from the toolbar:
However, you can also create more freehand-based objects as well. Let's look at how we can 
create a simple freehand triangle:
1.	 Select the Bezier tool:
2.	 Click once where you want the first corner and then move the mouse/pointer to the 
next corner. A node appears with the click and then a freehand line:

Chapter 6
[ 117 ]
3.	 When you have the length of the first side of the triangle estimated, click for the 
second corner:
4.	 Move the mouse to form the second side and click for the third corner:

Building Objects
[ 118 ]
5.	 Move the mouse back to the first corner node and click it to form the triangle, 
shown as follows:
6.	 Now save the file. From the main menu, select File and then Save. We will use this 
triangle to build a graphic later in this book, so choose a location to save so that you 
will know where to find the file.
7.	 Now that the basic triangle is saved, let's also experiment with how we can 
manipulate the shape itself and/or the shape's position on the canvas. Let's start 
with manipulating the triangle.
8.	 Select the triangle and drag a handle to a new location. You have essentially skewed 
the triangle, as shown in the following diagram:
9.	 To change the overall shape of the triangle, select the triangle, then click the Edit 
path by Nodes tool (or press F2):

Chapter 6
[ 119 ]
10.	Now the nodes of the triangle are displayed as follows:
11.	Nodes are points on a path that define the path's shape. Click a node and you can 
drag it to another location to manipulate the triangle's overall shape as follows:

Building Objects
[ 120 ]
12.	Double-click between two nodes to add another node and change the shape:
13.	If you decide that you don't want the extra node, click it (the node turns red),  
press Delete on your keyboard and it disappears.
14.	You can also use the control bar to add, delete, or manipulate the path/shape  
and nodes:
15.	If you want to change the position of the shape on the canvas by choosing the Select 
tool in the toolbox, click and drag the shape and move it where you need it to be.
16.	Change the size of the shape by also choosing the Select tool from the toolbox, 
clicking and holding the edge of the shape at the handle (small square or circles at 
edges), and dragging it outward to grow larger or inward to shrink until the shape is 
of the desired size.
17.	You can also rotate an object. Choose the Select tool from the toolbox and  
single-click the shape until the nodes turn to arrows with curves (this might  
require you to click the object a couple of times). When you see the curved  
arrow nodes, click-and-drag on a corner node to rotate the object until it is  
rotated and positioned correctly.

Chapter 6
[ 121 ]
18.	No need to save this file again after we have manipulated it—unless you want to 
reference this new version of the triangle for future projects. But we will revisit the 
original triangle shape in Chapter 7, Using Paths.
What just happened?
We created a free-form triangle and saved it for a future project. We also manipulated  
the shape in a number of ways—used the nodes to change the skew of the overall shape, 
added nodes to change the shape completely, and also how to move the shape around on 
the canvas.
Fill and Stroke
As you've already noticed, when creating objects in Inkscape they have color associated with 
them. You can fill an object with a color as well as give the object an outline or stroke. This 
section will explain how to change these characteristics of an object in Inkscape.
Fill and Stroke dialog
You can use the Fill and Stroke dialog from the main menu to change the fill colors of  
an object.
Time for action – using the Fill and Stroke dialog
Let's open the dialog and get started:
1.	 Open your triangle Inkscape file again and select the triangle.
2.	 From the main menu, choose Object | Fill and Stroke (or use the Shift + Ctrl + F 
keyboard shortcut).

Building Objects
[ 122 ]
3.	 The Fill and Stroke dialog appears on the right-hand side of your screen.  
Notice it has three tabs: Fill, Stroke paint, and Stroke style, as shown in  
the following screenshot:
4.	 Select the Fill tab (if not already selected). Here are the options for fill:


Type of fill: The buttons below the Fill tab allow you to select the type of 
fill you would like to use. No fill (the button with the X), flat color, linear or 
radial gradients. In the previous example screenshot, the flat fill button  
is selected.


Color picker: Another set of tabs below the type of the fill area are 
presented; RGB, CMYK, HSL, and Wheel. You can use any of these to choose 
a color. The most intuitive option is Wheel as it allows you to visually see all 
the colors and rotate a triangle to the color of your choice, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 6
[ 123 ]
'


Once a color is chosen, then the exact color can be seen in various values on 
the other color picker tabs.


Blur: Below the color area, you also have an option to blur the object's fill. 
This means that if you move the sliding lever to the right, the blur of the 
fill will move outward. See the following diagram for examples of an object 
without and with blur:


Opacity: Lastly, there is the opacity slider. By moving this slider to the right 
you will give the object an alpha of opacity setting making it a bit more 
transparent. The following diagram demonstrates opacity:

Building Objects
[ 124 ]
5.	 In the Fill and Stroke dialog, if you select the Stroke paint tab, you will notice it 
looks very much like the Fill tab. You can remove the stroke (outline) of the object, 
set the color, and determine if it is a flat color or gradient:
6.	 In the last tab, Stroke style is where you can most notably set the width  
of the stroke:

Chapter 6
[ 125 ]
7.	 You can also use this tab to determine what types of corners or joins an object  
has (round or square corners) and how the end caps of the border look like.
8.	 The Dashes field gives options for the stroke line type, as shown in the  
following screenshot:
9.	 Start, Mid, and End Markers allow you to add end points to your strokes, as follows:

Building Objects
[ 126 ]
10.	For our triangle object, use the Fill tab and choose a green color, no stroke, and 100 
percent opacity:
What just happened?
You learned where to open the Fill and Stroke dialog, adjust the fill of an object, use blur  
and opacity, and how to change the stroke color and weights of the stroke line.
Next, let's learn other ways to change the fill and stroke options.
Color palette bar
You can also use the color palette bar to change fill color:
Time for action – using the color palette
Let's learn all the tips and tricks for using the color palette bar:
1.	 From the palette bar, click a color and drag it from the palette onto the object to 
change its fill, as shown in the following diagram:

Chapter 6
[ 127 ]
2.	 You can also change an object and the stroke color in a number of other ways:


Select an object on the canvas and then click a color box in the palette to 
immediately set the fill of an object.


Select an object on the canvas and then right-click a color box in the palette. 
A popup menu appears with options to set the fill (and stroke).


If you hold the Shift key and drag a color box onto an object, it changes the 
stroke color.


Shift + left-click a color box to immediately set the stroke color.
Note, you can use the scroll bar just below the viewable color swatches 
on the color palette to scroll right to see even more color choices.
What just happened?
You learned how to change the fill and stroke color of an object by using the color swatches 
on the color palette bar on the main screen of Inkscape.
Dropper
Yet another way to change the fill or stroke of an object is to use the dropper:

Building Objects
[ 128 ]
Let's learn how to use it.
Time for action – using the dropper tool
Open an Inkscape file with objects on the canvas or create a quick object to try this out:
1.	 Select an object on the canvas.
2.	 Select the dropper tool from the toolbar or use the shortcut key F7.
3.	 Then click anywhere in the drawing with that tool that has the color you want to 
choose. The chosen color will be assigned to the selected object's fill. Alternatively, 
use Shift + click to set the stroke color.
4.	 Be aware of the tool control bar and the dropper tool controls, shown as follows:
5.	 The two buttons affect the opacity of the object, especially if it is different than the 
100% setting.


If Pick is disabled, then the color as chosen by the dropper looks exactly like 
it is on screen


If Pick is enabled and Assign is disabled, then the color picked by the 
dropper is one that the object would have if its opacity was 100%


If Pick is enabled and Assign is enabled, then the color and opacity  
are both copied from the picked object
What just happened?
By using the dropper tool, you learned how to change a color of another object  
on the screen.

Pop quiz – changing Fill and Stroke
TRUE OR FALSE: No matter what way you use to change fill and stroke of an object in 
Inkscape, it all has the same outcome for the object on your canvas.
Grouping
You can combine several objects into what we call a group. The group then, can be moved or 
transformed (made larger/smaller) as if it were one object.
Time for action – grouping objects
When grouping objects, there is no limit to the number of objects that can be grouped 
together. You can also take multiple groups and group them together as well. Let's start with 
a simple example of how to group objects:
1.	 Open an Inkscape document and draw separate objects to create the shape of a sun 
as follows:

Building Objects
[ 130 ]
2.	 Now select all the objects on your screen. Click the select tool and then click and 
drag a bounding box around all objects that you want in the group or press the  
Ctrl + A key and select all objects on the canvas:
3.	 Once all the objects are selected, from the main menu select Object | Group or use 
the Ctrl + G shortcut keys, as shown in the following screenshot:
You'll notice the bounding box that was once around each individual object has now 
bound around the entire group of objects. You'll also notice in the status bar that a 
group is selected and the number of objects it contains (group of <x> objects in layer 
<layer name>).

Chapter 6
[ 131 ]
4.	 Now you can select the group and move it on the canvas. Notice, all of the objects 
move as one:

Building Objects
[ 132 ]
5.	 You can also transform the object by dragging any corner node to make the group of 
objects smaller or bigger. You can even drag those handles and skew and rotate the 
group of objects as follows:
6.	 To add additional objects to this group, double-click the group itself then draw  
or paste the new object to be included.
To ungroup, select the group and then from the main menu select Object | Ungroup 
(or use the shortcut keys Ctrl + U). If you have grouped more than one group, 
ungrouping will only "disconnect" the topmost level of grouping; you'll need to 
ungroup repeatedly to keep ungrouping objects.
7.	 If you want to edit an object within a group, you don't have to ungroup it. Just press 
the Ctrl key and click that object and it will be selected and editable. Alternatively, 
select the node tool and click the individual object within a group for editing.
What just happened?
You were able to group several objects and then manipulate that group of objects as  
one—moving, transforming, and editing it. We even discussed a little trick about editing 
individual objects within a group.

Chapter 6
[ 133 ]
Pop quiz – shortcut keys to quickly ungroup items
1.	 What is the shortcut key combination for quickly ungrouping items?
a.	 Shift + G + U
b.	 Ctrl + G
c.	
Shift + G
d.	 Ctrl + U
Clipping and masking
Another way of joining objects is to use clips and masks. These features are used to 
determine which parts of an object are visible. Clips define what areas of another object  
are fully visible. Technically speaking, Inkscape takes the top object's path in and clips all  
the paths below it (in the selection) to the shape of the top path.
When you use a mask it visually crops objects with transparent areas to become fully 
transparent in the masked object, white areas become fully opaque, and all other colors 
translate into different levels of opacity in the masked object. To make sure this is clear,  
we'll do a few exercises.
Time for action – clipping objects
Let's build out our triangle object and create a tree that has a pattern of leaves in it:
1.	 Open your triangle Inkscape file.
2.	 Use the Bezier tool and create a rectangular shape below your triangle, as shown  
in the following diagram:
3.	 Remember if you don't get the lines exactly right the first time, select the Edit Paths 
by Nodes tool and adjust by dragging the nodes to the appropriate locations.

Building Objects
[ 134 ]
4.	 Draw another rectangular object below the previous one, as shown in the  
following diagram:
5.	 And draw the final rectangle below the last one as follows:
6.	 Now we are going to focus on making the left sides of the three rectangular objects 
more rounded and smooth. Select the first rectangle and choose the Edit Paths by 
Nodes tool.
7.	 Add a node on the left side of that rectangular object:

Chapter 6
[ 135 ]
8.	 Select the smooth node option from the control bar:
9.	 Your left side will now become a curve, as shown in the following diagram:
10.	Repeat, adding a node and smoothing the left side of each of the remaining two 
rectangles as follows:
11.	On the bottom rectangle, add another node in the middle of the bottom side and 
smooth it so it has a more rounded side to it, as shown in the following diagram:

Building Objects
[ 136 ]
12.	Now it is time to adjust the color and stroke of each of the objects on the  
canvas. Move the color palette bar scroll bar to the right to get to a set of  
green colors as follows:
13.	Select the top triangle and choose a light color green for it:
14.	Select each of the rectangles and give an increasingly darker green color to  
them as follows:
15.	Now select all objects on the canvas (Ctrl + A) and remove the stroke:

Chapter 6
[ 137 ]
16.	With all of the objects still selected on the canvas, create a duplicate of them.  
From the main menu select File | Duplicate (or use the Ctrl + D shortcut keys).
17.	Click the flip horizontally button:

Building Objects
[ 138 ]
18.	Move the objects so they mirror the original shapes, as shown in the  
following diagram:
19.	Add a long vertical rectangle at the bottom for the leaf stem:
20.	Again, select all objects on the screen by pressing Ctrl + A and group them so they 
become one object. From the main menu select Object | Group or use the Ctrl + G 
shortcut keys. You have created one leaf!
21.	Select your leaf, press the Shift key, and then drag the handle of the bounding box 
inward to scale your leaf smaller.
22.	With the leaf still selected, from the main menu choose, Edit | Clone | Create Tiled 
Clones... as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 6
[ 139 ]
23.	From the Clone dialog, for Rows, columns: adjust to 10 x 10 and click Create,  
as shown in the following screenshot:

Building Objects
[ 140 ]
24.	Your canvas will now have a pattern/grid of leaves on it:
25.	Press Ctrl + A to select all of the leaves and then use the Ctrl + G shortcut keys  
to group them.
26.	Use the Bezier tool and create a simple triangle tree shape, as shown in the 
following diagram:

Chapter 6
[ 141 ]
27.	Make sure that the basic tree you just created (that will be used as a clip or mask) 
overlaps the others. You can use the Ctrl + Page Up keys to ensure an object is the 
topmost object.
28.	Press Ctrl + A to select all objects on your canvas.
29.	In the main menu select Object | Clip | Set, as shown in the following screenshot:
30.	You can see how the top object becomes the shape of the object with the bottom 
object peeking through. Note, if you select three objects (instead of grouping) and 
perform a clip, you'll end up with two separate clipped objects:
Just like in a group, if you double-click a clip, you will be 
able to select and edit the objects within it.
31.	To edit the actual clip (or mask), you will have to release it first. From the main menu 
select Object | Clip | Release.

Building Objects
[ 142 ]
What just happened?
We took some objects, built a leaf object, cloned it to make a pattern, and used that to 
create a clipping mask. We even learned a few details about how to edit objects within the 
clip as well as releasing.
Time for action – masking objects
Here are some quick steps to see what a mask will look like:
1.	 Use the same objects in an open Inkscape document as in the previous example. 
This time, however, let's make the background leaves black and the tree in front  
a grayscale color as follows:
2.	 Press Ctrl + A to select all objects on your canvas.
3.	 In the main menu select Object | Mask | Set.

Chapter 6
[ 143 ]
4.	 In this result, the top object also becomes the overall shape, while the bottom  
peeks through. However, you will notice the degrees of grayscale setting over  
the entire object now. Masking depends only on grayscale. Thus, when using white, 
the objects below will be fully visible; when using black, the objects below will be 
fully blocked; and any gray level in between, the objects will be partially masked as 
in our example:

Building Objects
[ 144 ]
Just like in a group, if you double-click a clip, you will be able 
to select and edit the objects within it.
5.	 One other item to note here is that the resulting masked object will have a bounding 
box that will be as large as the largest object, which will make it hard to scale and 
align in some design situations.
6.	 To edit the actual clip (or mask), you will have to release it first. From the main 
menu, select Object | Mask | Release.
What just happened?
This time we created a mask and learned how to edit and release it in Inkscape.
Summary
You should be ready to move forward and learn even more about creating paths into 
complex shapes. We spent most of this chapter learning about the nuances of objects in 
Inkscape; how to build the predefined shapes and then how to combine and alter them  
using fills, strokes, clips, masks, and more. Now, we will learn about paths and how to 
manipulate them.

Using Paths
This chapter will focus on using paths. Paths are a critical element to Inkscape. 
We will focus on learning what paths are, working with them in Inkscape, and 
transforming, combining, and placing paths.
The following will be covered in the chapter:


Working with paths


Transforming objects into paths


Using stroke to paths


Path options


Combining and breaking paths


Path placement
Working with paths
As stated previously, vector graphics themselves are made up of paths. Paths can be used to 
create unique text styling when tracing other images like photographs, and when building 
icons, buttons, and logos. By adding and manipulating nodes, you can transform simple paths 
into elaborate illustrations.
The most common tool used to create paths in Inkscape is the Bezier tool and this is  
what will be used in most of the examples seen throughout this chapter. You can also  
use the Pencil (Freehand) and Calligraphy tools to create paths. All of these tools are  
found in the toolbox.

Using Paths
[ 146 ]
Before we get started, here are some key items to remember when using the Bezier tool 
when creating paths:


To start creating a path with the Bezier tool, click each spot you want a node to 
appear in


A single click creates a straight line and a sharp node creates a "corner"


To create a smooth node or a curve--click, hold and drag your cursor to create  
the curved/smooth node


Double-click to finish the path (for an open object)


To "close" a path, double-click on the starting node


Also, when you are drawing lines, the green lines are the completed segments and 
the red lines are those that you are still making
Let's jump in and start by learning how to build multiple paths into an interesting object. In 
the following examples, we will build a caricature of a woman's face. Each exercise will build 
on the next until we have a full image.
Time for action – using the Bezier tool
To begin, we will use the Bezier tool to create a woman's face shape:
1.	 Open a new document in Inkscape.
2.	 Now select the Bezier tool from the toolbox bar:
3.	 Using a series of straight paths, using single-clicks to create nodes, create a head 
shape, similar to the one shown in the following image:

Chapter 7
[ 147 ]
4.	 Make sure to close the path by double-clicking on the first node when complete.
5.	 Select the head object and choose the Edit Paths by Nodes tool:
All nodes on the object appear in a gray color.
From the main menu, choose Edit | Select All or use the Ctrl + A keyboard shortcut 
to select all nodes.
6.	 From the control bar, select the make selected nodes smooth icon:
All of the "angles" on your head shape will become smooth and have  
rounded corners:

Using Paths
[ 148 ]
7.	 Double-click a node to adjust its position (if needed). The node turns into a red square 
when it is "active" for you to edit its location. Now click-and-drag it to a new location.
As shown in the following image, the lower or chin portion of the head was adjusted 
to make it a bit more rounded. All of this is done by double-clicking the lower two 
nodes and moving their positions:
If, for any reason, you move a node and an undesired effect results, 
you can always undo the last node movement by using the keyboard 
shortcut Ctrl + Z or from the main menu, select Edit | Undo.
8.	 You can also adjust the curves of each node/path by moving the circular  
handles on each node. Select the node you would like to adjust, and instead  
of clicking-and-dragging the node, click-and-drag a handle (it will also turn red  
when active) to a new location.
You can also adjust the curve placement by moving the node along the path  
in either direction.
On the example, the node and its respective handles on the left side of the face 
were adjusted to make the face shape a bit more round:

Chapter 7
[ 149 ]
The shape of the face should now look similar to the following image:
9.	 Select the face object and choose a white fill from the color palette.
10.	 To work more easily with the facial features, let's lock this layer and create a new 
one. Press the shortcut keys: Shift + Ctrl + L to open the Layers dialog.
11.	 Press the lock key for Layer 1.
12.	 Create a new layer for the eyes. Press the + button in the Layers dialog. Name the 
layer Features and click Add.
13.	 Within the new layer, select the Bezier tool and create a diamond-like eye shape  
to start. In the following example, use four nodes (four clicks) to create this shape:

Using Paths
[ 150 ]
14.	 Again, click the Edit Paths by Nodes tool to edit the nodes of the eye object.
15.	 Select the top and bottom nodes of the eye object (use the Shift + click to  
select both nodes) and click the make selected nodes smooth icon to smooth  
the node angles:
16.	 To stylize the eye, let's pull the left node out to create a point as follows:
17.	 From the main menu, select Edit | Duplicate (or use the Ctrl + D keyboard shortcut).
18.	 Click the flip object horizontally button on the control bar:

Chapter 7
[ 151 ]
19.	 Place the right eye so that the middle edges are along the same horizontal plane. 
However, note, this horizontal line will be at a slight angle to accommodate for the 
tilting of the face:
20.	 Select the face object from Layer 1 (if you locked Layer 1, remember to unlock it first 
from the Layers dialog).
21.	 From the main menu, select Edit | Duplicate (or use the Ctrl + D keyboard shortcut).
22.	 Press Shift + Page Up (for Mac computers, press Shift + Fn + up arrow) to move  
the face object to the Features layer. Your screen should look similar to the  
following image:

Using Paths
[ 152 ]
23.	 Hold the Shift key and also select the "tail" of the eye that is seen from underneath 
the duplicate face object.
24.	 From the main menu, select Object | Clip | Set:
25.	 Hold the Shift key and select the other eye object. From the color palette, click black 
to fill both objects' color to black:
26.	 Click the Bezier tool and create a diamond shape, similar to what is shown in the 
following image, for the lips:

Chapter 7
[ 153 ]
Notice, this shape has six nodes. These were created with six clicks (double-click at 
the end to close the object).
If you had missed adding a node to form the lips, there is no need to 
delete the object and start over. You can double-click on any path to 
add a new node. Also, if you added too many nodes, you can always 
select the extra nodes and press the Delete key to erase them.
27.	 Select the lips and click the Edit Paths by Nodes tool to edit the nodes of the  
lip object.
28.	 Select the top two nodes and bottom node of the lip object (use Shift + click to 
select all three nodes) and click the make selected nodes smooth icon to smooth  
the node angles as follows:
29.	 Now move the nodes accordingly to adjust the lips to the right size and proportion. 
Notice, in the following example, the left and right nodes were pulled outward 
to broaden the lips. Also the two top rounded nodes were pulled left and right 
respectively to move the curve of the lips outward and the handles of both curves 
were used to get the appropriate curves of the lips:
30.	 Select red color from the color palette to fill the lip objects with color.

Using Paths
[ 154 ]
31.	 Right-click the stroke color from the status bar and choose none to remove the 
stroke from the lip object as well:
32.	 If you made it this far, save your file so we can move on to the next step in the 
process—creating the hair. From the main menu, select File | Save.
What just happened?
We started a new project: a stylized image of a woman's face. This project, so far, was 
created mostly using the Bezier tool. In fact, we used that as the base tool for creating  
every object on this canvas so far.
We learned the Bezier tool basics—what a single-click versus a double-click accomplishes 
(creating nodes on a path versus closing/ending a path), how to make a straight versus 
curved node, how to adjust node placements, add new nodes, and how to delete nodes.
We created the very basics of a face at this point in the project. Now we will move into 
the second part of the project where we will add hair to this project. In doing so, we will 
continue to use the Bezier tool, but also add in the use of spiros and swirls.
Pop quiz – remove the last node movement
1.	 If, for any reason, you move a node and an undesired effect results—what can you 
do to "undo" it?
a.	 Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Z
b.	 From the main menu select Edit and Undo
c.	
Delete the entire path
d.	 Both a and b

Chapter 7
[ 155 ]
Transforming objects into paths
In Inkscape, any shape, text, or object that you created can be converted to a shape. Don't 
be fooled when it doesn't look like anything has happened because any capabilities that you 
had before (dragging corner nodes to scale larger, editing text, rounding corners on a square) 
can be lost, but now, you would be able to edit the object's nodes just like any other path 
(such as in our previous example).
Stroke to paths
You can convert the outline or stroke of any object and convert that to a path. Select an 
object with a stroke set—then from the main menu, select Path | Stroke to Path. 
Again, the overall appearance on the canvas does not change, but how you can manipulate 
the object. Take a look at the number of nodes before this spiro was converted into a path, 
versus after:
After
Before
Time for action – creating spiros and swirls
Let's open our previous project of the woman's face and give her some hair. In doing so, we 
will use the Bezier tool and the spiral object in Inkscape (as shown previously), convert it to  
a path, and manipulate it to create curls as follows:
1.	 Open the woman's face project we've been working on.
2.	 Press the shortcut keys: Shift + Ctrl + L to open the Layers dialog.
3.	 Create a new layer for the hair object(s). Press the + button in the Layers dialog. 
Name the layer Hair and click Add.

Using Paths
[ 156 ]
4.	 Select the Bezier tool and create a general shape for her hair, as shown in the 
following image:
A few items to remember here are that you can add nodes, delete them, move  
and adjust them, so that you get a general hair shape that you like.
5.	 Now let's work some more with the nodes on the hair. You can select specific nodes 
(use Shift + click to select multiple nodes at the same time) and click the make 
selected nodes smooth icon to smooth the node angles. Also, just as in the previous 
exercise, feel free to move nodes and handles as needed for your desired effect.
6.	 You can also work with a number of smaller paths and then combine them as you 
need to. Important tools to remember are the join selected nodes, break path at 
selected nodes, join selected end nodes with segment, and delete segment between 
two non-endpoint nodes tools—all found on the control bar:
These buttons allow you to connect (or disconnect) two separate paths you have 
created with the Bezier tool.
7.	 For example let's break apart nodes near the neckline area and combine them so 
it looks like she has full flowing hair across her neck. Use Shift + click to select the 
nodes you want to break apart and then click the break paths and selected node 
button on the control bar as follows:

Chapter 7
[ 157 ]
8.	 Perform the same steps for two nodes on the right-hand side hair as well:
9.	 Now select the top node from the left-hand side and the top node from the right 
and click the join selected end nodes with segment button. The nodes are joined,  
as shown in the following image:

Using Paths
[ 158 ]
10.	 Repeat the process for the remaining two "open" nodes.
11.	 Give the hair some color as we work the shape a bit more. From the bottom color 
palette, choose black to fill this object with color and to give a more realistic view  
of the final project, as shown in the following image:
12.	 Continue to delete, move, and adjust nodes again to get a look of full hair at the 
neck because next we will be adding in some curls:

Chapter 7
[ 159 ]
13.	 Select the spiral tool icon from the toolbox bar:
14.	 In the control bar, change the Turns, Divergence, and Inner radius settings to your 
liking. For our purposes, we'll change them, as shown in the following screenshot,  
to create a smooth curve:
15.	 Now, draw the spiral on your canvas outside of your face objects for now:
16.	 If you want to adjust the spiral, select the end nodes tool and start changing it to 
your liking:

Using Paths
[ 160 ]
17.	 Click twice until you see the rotation handles. Float your mouse pointer over the tiny 
cross hair (center of rotation) in the center of the object. Now use Shift + drag to 
place the center of rotation above the location where the inner path ends, as shown 
in the following image:
18.	 Now we need to change the spiral object to a path. From the main menu, select 
Path and then Object to Path.
19.	 Next, from the main menu, select Edit and then Duplicate. We now have two spirals 
(one on top of another).
20.	 Choose the selector tool and then double-click the top duplicated spiral so the 
rotation handles appear, and rotate it just a bit as follows:

Chapter 7
[ 161 ]
21.	 Now click the original spiral, so that it is selected and scale it to a size that makes the 
swirl interesting. It might look something like the following image:
22.	 Now still with the selector tool, select both spirals (hold the Shift key and  
click-and-drag a bounding box over both spirals).
23.	 From the main menu, select Path and then combine.
24.	 Press the F2 key to switch to the Edit Path by Nodes tool and then select both  
outer end nodes and click the join selected end nodes with a new segment button 
as follows:
This joins the two nodes.

Using Paths
[ 162 ]
25.	 Do this with any other end nodes that aren't joined, smooth out any areas of the 
spiral to make it look more appealing, and delete any overlapping or crossovers of 
the lines:
26.	 Click white on the color palette bar to add a fill color to this spiral and remove  
the stroke.
27.	 Now drag it onto the hair of your image as follows:
28.	 Scale, rotate, skew, mode/delete nodes, and/or duplicate the swirls or other similar 
objects to use them as other "curls" and "highlights" in the hair object.
29.	 Again, adjust nodes in the hair as needed to achieve a pleasing effect for your image. 
See the following image for a version of this project. Note, all highlights and curls in 
the hair were adjusted, duplicated versions of the first. Nodes were deleted, added, 
and moved to create the others:

Chapter 7
[ 163 ]
30.	 From the main menu, select File | Save to save this project for future use  
and reference.
What just happened?
We spent even more time using paths. This time we started again with a Bezier tool and 
created a shape for the hair, but we then joined nodes with additional segments. Then we 
used a spiral object and converted it into a path to manipulate it and use it as curls within 
our project's hair.
Next up, we will work with text and convert it to a path.
Object to Path
To convert an object, we just select it and then from the main menu, choose Path | Object  
to Path or the Shift + Ctrl + C keyboard shortcut.
Note the following when you convert any text to a path:


The text becomes non-editable as a normal object.


The result will be a group of paths (one path for each letter). Then you  
can manipulate each letter by dragging nodes and editing the shape of each  
one individually.


You can always ungroup the letters. On the main menu, select Object | Ungroup.
Let's convert an object to a path and then demonstrate how we can edit it differently now 
that it is a path.

Using Paths
[ 164 ]
Time for action – Object to Path
We'll add stylized text to our current project of the woman's face to illustrate how to use  
the Object to Path functionality and how we can further manipulate the text when we  
use this feature:
1.	 Open your previous Inkscape project.
2.	 Press the shortcut keys: Shift + Ctrl + L to open the Layers dialog if it is not  
already open.
3.	 Create a new layer for the hair object(s). Press the + button in the Layers dialog. 
Name the layer: Text and click Add.
Locking layers
To prevent accidentally selecting other objects, lock all other layers 
except the one you are currently working on. In this case, lock all 
layers except the Text layer.
4.	 In the Add Layer, select the create and edit text button from the toolbox:
5.	 Click on the canvas and type the word: SMILE:
SMILE
6.	 Now we are going to convert the text to a path. From the main menu, choose  
Path | Object to path.
Now when you select the word, the bounding box has changed and you can only 
select individual letters as follows:

Chapter 7
[ 165 ]
SMILE
SMILE
7.	 You can manipulate or add effects to individual letters, or scale and transform each 
letter differently.
In the following example for the S and E, the outside nodes were "pulled" into  
a smile.
The letters MIL were stretched to larger sizes based on the placement. For the M 
and I, we also moved the outside nodes to make the letters wider. The letter I also 
had its fill color changed to red and a drop shadow added (Filters | Shadows and 
Glows | Drop Shadow):

and reference.

b.	 Shapes
c.	
Objects
d.	 All of the above
Path options
Paths can be combined in a number of ways:
Here's what each of these joining options mean:


Union: When you make a union of one or more paths, a new path is created that 
contains all areas of other parts. For example, the arrow we created earlier in this 
book joined all paths into one object.


Difference: When you complete the difference between two paths or objects—the 
top path is removed from that of the bottom one.


Intersection: When you perform an intersection of two paths, all that will remain is 
the area that was overlapping in both paths.


Exclusion: When two paths are combined using the exclusion function, the resulting 
path keeps everything except the portions of the paths that were shared.


Division: The first path as "drawn" will be split by the second and the outcome will 
be two or more paths.

Chapter 7
[ 167 ]


Cut Path: The first path is cut by the second drawn path, but the new paths have no 
fill, so the second path is a "cut out" of the first.
Time for action – creating an icon
We'll create an icon that has a border and star cut out. Let's get started:
1.	 Open a new document in Inkscape.
2.	 Select the create circles, ellipses, and arcs tool and draw a simple circle on the 
canvas. Hold the Ctrl key as you draw the circle to make it a perfect circle as follows:
3.	 Use the Fill and Stroke dialog to remove the stroke and add an orange fill, as shown 
in the following image:

Using Paths
[ 168 ]
4.	 Select the star tool from the toolbox:
Make sure that you have the star option selected in the control bar as well:
5.	 Draw a star in the middle of the circle. This star can have any color fill and stroke,  
as shown in the following image:
6.	 Select the circle and the star. From the main menu, select Object | Align  
and Distribute.
In the Align and Distribute dialog, click center on the vertical axis and then click  
on the horizontal axis as follows:

Chapter 7
[ 169 ]
7.	 From the main menu, select Path | Exclusion.
You should then see that the circle has a "cut out" of a star in the middle as follows:
8.	 Select the create circles, ellipses, and arcs tool again and draw a simple circle just 
smaller than the first and overlap it on the circle/star icon. Make this circle have no 
fill, but a white stroke that is 1px in weight:
9.	 From the main menu, choose File | Save to save this project for future use.

Using Paths
[ 170 ]
What just happened?
We created a simple icon that used the exclusion feature for paths.
There is also an Icon View option in Inkscape. If you want to see how your project would 
look as an icon, select all objects on all layers (Ctrl + Alt + A keyboard shortcut), and from 
the menu, choose View | Icon Preview. Check the selection box. A preview of your icon is 
displayed in the most common size.
Summary
We learned a lot about paths in this chapter. We first just learned the basics about using 
them and the Bezier tool. Then we learned about transforming paths and how to convert 
shapes and strokes into paths so we could adjust them using nodes. We explored all path 
options, combining and breaking paths, as well as path placement and how it transforms 
shapes. Next up is styling text.

How to Style Text
The idea of text styling is to manipulate text so that it creates a certain feel 
when seen in an overall design. In the graphic design world, text styling is called 
typography and is a form of typesetting. Compare the look and feel (or design) 
of your local newspaper with that of children's magazines or start comparing 
web designs of the same—a newspaper site or a children's television network 
and compare it to a sports website. As seen, text is an important element  
in design.
Let's use this chapter to learn more about how we can manipulate and style text for any 
design. Here's what we will cover:

Text and Font editor
The Text and Font editor allows you to create text on your canvas and format it with the 
right font, size, and even kern. Let's open the editor and get started.

How to Style Text
[ 172 ]
Time for action – opening and using the Text and Font editor
Creating text in a project is simple—select the Create and Edit Text tool in the toolbox, click 
at the insertion point within an open project, and start typing.
The text is immediately displayed on the canvas.
The text tool (A icon) in the toolbox is the only way of creating new text on 
the canvas. The T icon shown in the command bar is used only when editing 
text that already exists on the canvas.
Then you can use the Text and Font menu to change everything from the font, style, size, 
and justification. To open this window, from the main menu, select Text and then Text and 
Font (or use the shortcut keys and press Shift+Ctrl+T, or the T icon in the command bar).
This window dialog also has a useful feature where you can edit your text directly. Click the 
Text tab and select the text you want to change or add/delete.

Chapter 8
[ 173 ]
Back in the Font tab, you can change the font itself, the point size, alignment, line spacing, 
and even change from a horizontal to vertical text layout. But note, even though there are 
options for Bold, Italics, and Bold Italics, there is no option for underline. You can, however, 
use the Bezier or line tool to give you the same effect as the underline feature.
Spacing shortcut keys
You can also change the spacing of selected text by using shortcut keys. Use 
the Alt + > or Alt + < keys to try it out. For more information about keyboard 
shortcuts, see Appendix A, Keyboard Shortcuts.
What just happened?
You opened the Text and Font editor and added some text to your canvas. We also saw 
how you can change the font, point size, alignment, line spacing, and even how to adjust 
horizontal and vertical text layout.

Kerning
One of the more important items in typography and working with text that you will want to 
learn about is kerning—or the ability to adjust the spacing between letters.
There is no menu path to perform this in Inkscape. Instead, you can use handy shortcut keys. 
For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see Appendix A, Keyboard Shortcuts.

How to Style Text
[ 174 ]
Time for action – kerning text
Here's how to kern text that already exists on your canvas:
1.	 First, double-click some text you have already entered in an open project.  
This will take you into the Create and Edit Text tool, allowing you to edit the  
text letter-by-letter.
2.	 Using the arrow keys, move the cursor between the two letters you want to add  
or diminish space between.
3.	 Then, press the Alt + right arrow key to add space between the letters. Alternatively, 
press the Alt + left arrow key to lessen the space between those two letters. Keep an 
eye on the kerning value in the Tool control bar A | A. It is set in pixels and displays 
fractions of the value of space between the letters.
4.	 Alternatively, if you want to move individual (or multiple) characters up and  
down—just move your cursor near the letter (or letters) you want to move vertically.
5.	 Select the letter(s) by using the Shift key and the right/left arrows or drag your 
mouse over the character(s) you want to edit.
6.	 Then press Alt + up key to move the letter(s) up from the horizontal baseline.  
Again, see the Tools control bar setting A|A for the specific spacing.

Chapter 8
[ 175 ]
7.	 Alternatively, you can use the Alt + down key combination to move a letter down 
from the horizontal baseline.
8.	 You can even rotate letters. Select a letter you want to rotate left or right and then 
use the Alt + [ or ] key to start moving it. The Tools control bar can, again, help you 
with exact spacing information.
9.	 Feel free to save the file now if you think you might want to use this going forward.
Baseline shift and letter rotation functions are only 
available to text that is not inside a flowed text frame.
What just happened?
You created some text on your canvas and then adjusted the kerning (or spacing) of  
letters. We even rotated and dropped lettings below (and above) the horizontal baseline  
for a different sort of text styling technique.
When adjusting kerning in Inkscape, it is convenient to leave the letters as text—instead  
of the alternative of converting the text to paths—as the text remains editable. You can 
easily switch fonts, change font sizes and styles, all without removing the kerning and 
spacing information that you have already set. One small disadvantage to this approach is 
that when you reopen (or deliver) an SVG file, you must have the original font used in this 
file's creation on the computer. Just remember when providing and saving the SVG file to 
keep all graphics and fonts used in the creation of the web design or graphic together and 
available for any future use.
You can also create a duplicate layer (File | Layer | Duplicate) and then hide it to 
preserve text styling for future rework of the document and text information.

Using paths and text
Using paths with text is a great combination to make unique designs for banners, logos, and 
headings or footers, on various business documents. They work together and allow you to 
have complete control over how the text will look. Let's review how we can make them  
work together.
Time for action – using a path for text
In Inkscape, you can put text onto a path and have it follow its shape—and when you do this, 
the text and the path remain editable, which means you can still change the text, the shape 
of the path, kerning, and spacing elements in the text. Let's look at an example:
1.	 To start, draw a path with the Bezier tool or in the case of the following example, 
the spiral tool.
2.	 Then use the text tool and type the text that you would like to place on the path.

How to Style Text
[ 178 ]
3.	 Select both the text and path.
4.	 Then, from the main menu, select Text and then Put on Path. You'll see that the text 
then is literally placed on the path of the line you had drawn.
5.	 You can now move the original path and the text moves along with it. Alternatively, 
you can move the text away from the path, edit the text, or transform the text using 
kerning, text size, rotating letters, or moving them from the baseline—but it will still 
hold the shape of the path.

Chapter 8
[ 179 ]
6.	 If you need to remove the shape from the text, from the main menu, select  
Text and then Remove from Path. You'll see that the text will turn back to  
a regular text object.
7.	 If you want the text to maintain the shape of the path, but hide the actual shape, 
select the path and change its opacity to 0, in essence, hiding the path.
What just happened?
You placed some text on a path of an object or shape. You also learned how to manipulate 
the text while it is placed on the page, as well as how to remove the text from the shape and 
hide the path itself so that you keep the text shape.
Placing text within a closed shape
Another unique form of text styling can be done by placing text within a shape. Words will 
automatically wrap so that the text fits as best as possible within the shape. You can, of 
course, still edit the text after this, and even change some of its features.

How to Style Text
[ 180 ]
Time for action – placing text in a closed shape
Let's walk through an example of how to place the words "Twinkle, twinkle little star" into  
a star object:
1.	 First create a star in a new Inkscape document.
2.	 Select the Create and Edit Text tool from the toolbox and type the text onto  
the canvas.
3.	 Select both the text and the star. Then from the main menu, choose Text and then 
Flow into Frame. Instantly, you'll see that the text is placed, as best as it can be, 
within the confines of the shape.

Chapter 8
[ 181 ]
4.	 Feel free to manipulate the text to make it look just right, even changing color, 
kerning, and spacing if needed. Similarly you can change the color, stroke, and 
position of the shape to see how the text reacts as well as the impact on the  
overall design.
5.	 If you ever want to remove the text from the shape, from the main menu,  
choose Text and then Unflow.
6.	 Save the file in the Inkscape SVG format if you plan to use this file in any  
future projects!
What just happened?
We took some simple text and then placed it within a shape. Then we took that text and 
manipulated it so that it would take the shape of another object. Lastly, we rotated and 
manipulated the container shape to have the best impact on the design.
Spell check and find/replace
Just like in a word processing program, you can find and replace a word (or term) in the text 
box of an Inkscape document.

How to Style Text
[ 182 ]
Time for action – performing a find and replace
We will perform a simple find and replace in the following example. To do this:
1.	 In an open project, choose the Create and Edit Text tool and select an  
already-created text box with content residing in it.
2.	 From the main menu, select Extensions and then Text and Replace Text.
3.	 In the Replace text dialog box, place the word you want to replace in the first  
field and the new word in the second field.
4.	 Click Apply and every instance of the old word will be replaced within the selected 
text box.
Remember, using this process will replace every single instance of a word 
in the selected text. If you only want to replace certain instances of the 
word, this process might be superseded by some careful proofreading of 
the content.
What just happened?
We found the menu options in order to perform a search and replace for words within a text 
frame in Inkscape.
Text effects
Inkscape gives a variety of options for manipulating text within its extensions. Let's go 
through a few examples.

Chapter 8
[ 183 ]
Time for action – using text effects
We will perform a number of text effects that are available in Inkscape. Let's get started:
1.	 Sentence case: This simply means using capital letters as you would in sentences—it 
replaces lowercase characters with capitals at the beginning of every sentence.
To use this in Inkscape:


In an open project, choose the Create and Edit Text tool and select an 
already-created text box with content residing in it.


From the main menu, select Extensions and then Text and Sentence Case. 
All capitalization rules will change to sentence case.
2.	 Title case: Instead of capitalizing the first word in every sentence like the previous 
example, this text effect capitalizes the first letter of every word in the text box.


In an open project, choose the Create and Edit Text tool and select an 
already-created text box with content residing in it.


From the main menu, select Extensions, Text, and Title Case. All 
capitalization rules will change to be title case.
3.	 Uppercase and lowercase: These effects simply change the case of each letter in the 
text box. The uppercase effect makes each letter a capital, whereas the lowercase 
effect changes all letters to their lowercase form.
As with the other effects you do this as follows:


In an open project, choose the text tool and select an already-created text 
box with content residing in it.


From the main menu, select Extensions,  Text and then Uppercase  
or Lowercase. All capitalization rules will change as specified.

How to Style Text
[ 184 ]
4.	 Flipcase: This is a fun effect for text. It reverses the written letter case, so all capitals 
will become lowercase, and all lowercase letters become uppercase letters. It looks 
like this:
Again, this is accessed from the Effect menu:


In an open project, choose the text tool and select an already-created text 
box with content residing in it.


From the main menu, select Extensions and then Text and fLIP cASE.
5.	 Random case: This is also a fun text effect; it takes the text contained in a text box 
and arbitrarily toggles the letter case throughout. To use it:


In an open project, choose the text tool and select an already-created text 
box with content residing in it.


From the main menu, select Extensions and then Text and rANdOm CasE. 
The result looks something like this:
What just happened?
We learned the basics of creating text and manipulating it in Inkscape with extensions. 
Specifically, we dived into text effects, learning the differences between title case, sentence 
case, upper and lowercase, flip case, and random case in Inkscape. We even worked on 
examples of each type for reference.
Creating text reflections
One common effect seen with text elements is creating a reflection or shadow of the  
letters in the word. This effect gives the words more presence without much additional  
work (and doesn't overdo the text). We'll learn how to do both with some example text.

Chapter 8
[ 185 ]
Time for action – creating a reflection
In this example, we're aiming to create a simple text heading that has a reflection below it 
and then to add a little something special (but very simple) to the text to make it stand apart 
with very few additional effects. Here's what we'll create:
1.	 Open a new document in Inkscape, create a text box, and enter some text. In our 
example, we'll use the word: REFLECTIONS.
2.	 Next, we are going to clone the image. From the main menu, select Edit, Clone,  
and then Create Clone.

How to Style Text
[ 186 ]
3.	 Now we need to flip the cloned image vertically to create the basics for our 
reflection. An easy way to do this is to press the V key (or from the main menu, 
select Object and then Flip Vertically).
4.	 Move the flipped image below the original text.
5.	 From the toolbox, select the rectangle tool and create a rectangle that covers the 
reflected (or cloned) image.
6.	 Now we need to set a gradient on this rectangle. To start, make sure to set the  
fill to black.
7.	 Click the gradient tool near the bottom of the toolbox.
8.	 Click near the middle of the rectangle and drag upward to set gradient  
(from dark on the bottom to light on the top).
9.	 By default the Inkscape gradient applies an alpha setting of 0 to the stop gradient, 
which will be fully transparent. This means, in the preceding image, the top side of 
the rectangle and the gradient would be transparent. Click Edit in the control bar to 
change this setting.

Chapter 8
[ 187 ]
10.	Choose the transparent stop to edit.
11.	Now change the R, G, and B values to 255, so that it is white.

How to Style Text
[ 188 ]
12.	Select both the rectangle and the reflected text behind. Use the select tool, and  
drag a bounding box around the rectangle. You should see a dotted line around  
the rectangle and the text behind it. Alternatively, you can select the text below by 
using Alt and clicking the text's approximate location and then pressing Shift and 
clicking on the rectangle.
13.	From the main menu, select Object, then Mask, and then Set. Essentially you are 
masking the reflection (cloned) text with the gradient box. Thus the reflection text 
takes on the levels of gray of the object in front of it. That is why it looks very much 
like a reflection.
14.	If the reflection still seems a bit dark for your taste, change the opacity from the  
Fill and Stroke dialog box.
15.	But let's spice up this text just a little bit more. Select the first letter and let's change 
the color and also increase the point size of that letter by at least 8 points—voila! 
Since you cloned the image, any change you make to original text will also be 
changed in the reflection automatically.
16.	Feel free to save this file for future reference or to use in your current projects.

Chapter 8
[ 189 ]
What just happened?
We created a reflection of text in Inkscape. We did this by creating text, using a clone, and 
then using a mask in order to create the actual reflection text. There are a number of other 
ways to create a reflection—that involve just creating a gradient on the cloned/flipped text 
itself. However, the process described in the preceding section allows you to still edit the text 
directly and the reflection will update as well.
Pop Quiz – transparency
1.	 In Inkscape, by default, the Alpha setting or Stop of gradients is white.
a.	 True
b.	 False
Summary
You've learned a lot about text editing and styling in this chapter. Specifically, there were details 
about the text editor, methods of using and manipulating text such as kerning, rotating, and 
moving letters from the baseline. You even learned how to have text follow a path and create 
text frames for larger blocks of text and finally create a reflection with the text. We will expand 
upon what we have learned and do more of this in the next chapter, Using Filters.

Using Filters
This chapter will focus on using filters with text and images to give a further 
dimension to your vector graphics. We will start by explaining what filters 
are, how to find them in Inkscape, and then dive into specific filter examples 
with both images and texttext, including a detailed example of step-by-step 
instructions on using filters with text.

Images and effects
What are filters?
In Inkscape, think of a filter as something superimposed on top of a vector object giving 
it features that are much like a raster-based image. Examples of filters or filter effects are 
blurring, shadows, and glows. These effects are only an overlay—so can be turned on/off 
at any time and modified whenever needed, in essence, giving the vector-object properties 
most commonly seen on other graphic types.

Using Filters
[ 192 ]
Using the Filter editor
To view all the filters that Inkscape has to offer (there are hundreds of them installed  
by default), on the main menu, select Filters:
There are two categories of filters: the ones that work with normal objects (such as a created 
vector object in Inkscape) and the others that work with bitmaps (such as images or PNG files 
you have imported into Inkscape). Watch the notification area along the bottom of the screen 
when you use the filter menu for which filters will work on your selected objects as follows:
Since there are many filters to use with Inkscape, it may seem overwhelming to know  
which one to use. You should explore and test to see which ones work best for your  
design or drawing.
Let's work through an example about how to use one of the filters in Inkscape.

Chapter 9
[ 193 ]
Time for action – using filters
In this example, let's create an icon, such as the example shown as follows:
Let's give it a drop shadow, which is one of the more common filter effects used in Inkscape 
and almost all image editing software as it is an essential filter for creating a sense of realism:
1.	 Open a new Inkscape document.
2.	 From the main menu, select File, New, and then icon_64x64.
Icon sizes can vary depending on your design (or what operating 
system you might be creating them for), so feel free to change 
your canvas sizes accordingly.
3.	 From the main menu, select View and then Grid. Having the grid viewable will help 
us with the spacing of all the objects.
4.	 Let's again set the grid properties. From the main menu, select File and then 
Document Properties.
5.	 Select the Grid tab and verify that Spacing X and Spacing Y are both set to 1.0  
and that Major Grid Lines is set to every 4 pixels.
6.	 Close the Document Properties dialog by clicking the red X in the upper-left corner.
7.	 Make sure the snap bounding box corners icon is selected.

Using Filters
[ 194 ]
8.	 Let's start by creating the main part of the icon. Use the rectangle tool to draw 
a rectangle in the center of the canvas (there will be one box grid around the 
rectangle) as follows:
9.	 Double-click the square, so the handles change to corner nodes:
10.	Drag the upper-right circle handle inward. You will see that the corners of the 
rectangle now become rounded, as shown in the following image:

Chapter 9
[ 195 ]
11.	Use the Fill and Stroke dialog to give the rectangle a bright fill color.  
This will keep the edges of the icon clean and crisp.
12.	Next we'll add our first filter. Select the rectangle object and select  
Filter | Blur | Evanescent:
13.	Select the star tool and draw one within the rectangle, as shown in the  
following image:
14.	Select all of the icon elements using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + A, then use the 
keyboard shortcut Shift + Ctrl + A to open the Alignment menu. Choose the Page in 
the Relative to: drop-down menu and then click the center of the vertical axis icon.

Using Filters
[ 196 ]
15.	Now let's give the star a drop shadow. Select the star and then from the main menu, 
select Filters, Shadows and Glows, and then Drop Shadow. Use settings similar to 
that shown in the following screenshot:
16.	Let's give our overall rectangle object a drop shadow as well. Keeping the  
Drop Shadow window displayed, select the rectangle.
17.	Click Apply in the Drop Shadow window (to keep the same Drop Shadow settings  
as the star):
18.	Save your file using a nomenclature that represents a collection of icons that you 
can create with these same document properties, color characteristics, and similar 
styles for future project use.
What just happened?
We created a simple icon, used an image filter, and the drop shadow filter effect—a complex 
filter – to give the icon some depth.

Chapter 9
[ 197 ]
To preview this as an icon, select all objects on all layers (Ctrl + Alt + A is the keyboard 
shortcut), and from the menu, choose View | Icon Preview. Check the selection box.  
A preview of your icon is displayed in the most common size.
Pop quiz – common icon sizes
1.	 What icon size below is NOT found in the icon preview option in Inkscape?
a.	 16 x 16
b.	 40 x 40

d.	 32 x 32
e.	 24 x 24
f.

Using filters with text
We created a reflection in Chapter 8 that used filters in Inkscape and you can use the same 
principles for creating text shadows as well. Let's work through an example and see whether 
other filters work well with text.
Time for action – using filters with text
We will create one example of how we can use filters with text to create a mood or feeling 
with text in design:
1.	 Open a new document in Inkscape, create a text box, and enter some text. In our 
example, we'll use the word: BOO!.
2.	 With the text selected, from the main menu, select Filters, Textures, and then 
choose Ink Paint:

Using Filters
[ 198 ]
There are a lot more filters here that you can use that will give neat effects for your 
text. These include Cutout, Cutout & Glow, Dark & Glow, Drop Glow, Fuzzy Glow, 
Glow, In and Out, Inner Glow, Inner Shadow, and Inset. See the following graphic for 
what each of these filters looks like when applied to our text examples. You can find 
these specific text filters on the main menu under Filters | Shadows and Glows:
The effects strongly depend on the objects and their colors in the background. 
The examples were only rendered without objects in the background and thus 
some of the filters may require some tweaking in the Filter editor for a more 
refined look.
What just happened?
We added a simple Ink Paint filter to a set of words to add to the visual feeling we wanted  
to achieve in a design. Then we learned about other filters that might work well with text.

For some fun, try Scatter and Texture filters and Clip with photographs as well.
Let's walk through using one of these filters as an example.
Time for action – using filters with images
Let's work with a photograph of a couple and see if we can enchance it for use on  
a cooking website:
1.	 Open a new Inkscape document and import a bitmap image. From the main menu, 
select File and then Import.
2.	 Select the correct bitmap file and click Open. Make sure your imported bitmap file 
is selected and then select File and then Document Properties. In the Custom Size 
section, click Resize page to content.
3.	 Click Resize page to drawing or selection.

Using Filters
[ 200 ]
Your document page size will now be adjusted to match that of your imported 
bitmap image, as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 Select the image and then from the main menu, select Filters and then Image 
Effects and Soft Focus Lens. This will create a "soft" image and give a dreamy  
effect as follows:

Chapter 9
[ 201 ]
5.	 Next, we will create a "torn edge" effect around the photo by making sure the photo 
is selected and then from the main menu, choosing Filters and then Distort and 
Torn edges as follows:
6.	 Now the photo can be saved as a PNG and placed in an overall design. To save this 
file, from the main menu, select File and then Export. Give it a filename and save it 
within the project file folders.
What just happened?
We imported a bitmap image (a photograph) and then added two filters to it—a blur and 
distortion filter of torn edges.
Tracing images
Tracing essentially creates the paths (and nodes) it identifies within a bitmap image and then 
uses those paths to create a vector-based image from the bitmap. Rendering in Inkscape 
is always done using Potrace, but there is an extra option called Simple Interactive Object 
Extraction (SIOX) that allows separation of an object from the background bitmap image.
The results of this tracing process depend heavily on the quality of the original images. 
Potrace works best for black-and-white line drawings or black-and-white pictures with  
high contrast. It can be used for screened color prints and color photography as well,  
but it can require a bit more careful detail and work to make it happen. Let's go through  
a couple of examples.

Using Filters
[ 202 ]
Time for action – using Potrace
We will start by importing another photograph bitmap image and then using Potrace:
1.	 Open up the bitmap image you want to trace in Inkscape. You can drag-and-drop  
an image onto the Inkscape window to import it.
2.	 Make sure the image is selected and then from the main menu, choose Path  
and then Trace Bitmap. The Trace Bitmap dialog box appears.
3.	 The Mode tab defines characteristics of the tracing mode as follows:
For this picture, we will set the following:


Single scan


Brightness cutoff: Threshold 0.450

Chapter 9
[ 203 ]
4.	 Click the Options tab to set some additional options as follows:
These options are used across either the single or multiple scan mode.
For this sample, we'll select the checkboxes for all options (essentially turning them 
on) with these settings:


Suppress speckles: Size 2


Smooth corners: Threshold 1.00


Optimize paths: Tolerance 0.20
5.	 When all settings are in place, click OK to perform the conversion.
6.	 Within a few moments, you will be able to see the results.

Using Filters
[ 204 ]
You'll notice your original image will still be viewable on the canvas. Click to select 
the traced paths and then drag it off of the original image (which is underneath).  
Alternatively, from the main menu, select Object and then Lower—to lower the  
new image below the original:
7.	 Select the original image and hide it in the Layers dialog. Your new vector image 
should be viewable.
8.	 Save this new file (choose File and then Save As…) with a new descriptive filename 
and be sure that the file type in the bottom-right is Inkscape SVG:
What just happened?
In this example, we kept the background in place and created a vector image from  
a photograph.
However, another scenario is that you want to take one object from the picture and create 
a vector object from that one object. That is where using the option SIOX comes into play. 
Let's learn how to use it in the next section.

Chapter 9
[ 205 ]
Time for action – using SIOX
SIOX means Simple Interactive Object Extraction. It lets you separate an object from the 
background in a bitmap image. If you paid close attention to the steps performed to do a 
trace in the previous section, you'll notice that the option to use this feature is within the 
Tracing Bitmap dialog box.
Using SIOX depends on the characteristics of the bitmap image. If you have a photograph 
where an object is clearly distinguished in color from the background—you have a great 
chance for success in recreating it with a trace using this feature. Here's how it's done:
1.	 Open up the bitmap image you want to trace in Inkscape.
2.	 Make sure the image is selected and then from the main menu, choose Path  
and then Trace Bitmap. The Trace Bitmap dialog box appears.
3.	 Check the SIOX foreground selection box to turn it on, as shown in the  
following screenshot:

Using Filters
[ 206 ]
4.	 Now, use the freehand tool or a box, circle, or another object, and select an area 
of the image that includes the entire object you want to extract, and some of the 
background, as follows:
5.	 Give the path an opaque fill if it doesn't already have one.
6.	 Select both the bitmap image and the path and then perform a trace by clicking  
OK in the Trace Bitmap dialog box:
7.	 Within a few moments, you'll see the background disappear from the canvas.  
Select the opaque object used in the process and delete it to show your final image:

Chapter 9
[ 207 ]
8.	 Save your new image in SVG format – it's now a vector graphic!
In the example, we used a rectangle object to select the main point of 
interest and some of the background. However, you can use the freehand 
Bezier tool as well to draw around irregular objects and do the same process.
What just happened?
We took a full photograph image and then essentially pulled an object from that photograph 
and made it a vector graphic via the tracing effect.
Ultimately, tracing bitmap images so that they can be turned into vector graphics takes some 
practice and trial-and-error. However, if you can do this well, you will use it in a variety of 
projects—anywhere from web design to helping to create and clean up logos and more.
Summary
We spent this entire chapter discussing filters and filter effects, learning where they  
are used in Inkscape, and then how to create a filter effect for a vector object.
The last half of the chapter was dedicated to examples of using Potrace and SIOX.  
The next chapter will be dedicated to extensions in Inkscape.

Extensions in Inkscape
In Inkscape there are a number of extensions—templates and plugins that can 
assist in the design process for vector graphics. At the very least, they decrease 
preparation time when starting a new mockup.
This chapter will discuss templates in detail, and then plugins and scripts. Specifically:

Templates
Inkscape has some pre-defined templates you can use to start your development.  
To access these templates, go to the main menu and select File and then New. A pop-up 
menu appears showing a number of default page (or canvas) sizes to choose from, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
Installing and using new templates
Most templates are pre-loaded into the Inkscape release and installation. However,  
if you find additional Inkscape templates you want to use, they can be easily installed.

Chapter 10
[ 211 ]
Time for action – installing Inkscape templates
To install a template in Inkscape, do the following:
1.	
Download the new template file. If it is in a compressed format (ZIP, RAR, and so 
on), uncompress or extract the SVG template file. You can use applications such as 
WinZip, WinRAR, or 7-Zip to extract files such as these.
2.	
Open the SVG file itself in Inkscape to view the template to make sure it fits  
your needs.
3.	
From the main menu, select File and then Save As. Choose a save location in your 
computer operating system's Inkscape template directory:


For Windows, that directory is the C:\Program Files\Inkscape\
share\templates folder


For Mac OS, the directory is /Applications/Inkscape/Contents/
Resources/Templates/


For Linux, the directory is typically /usr/local/share/inkscape/
templates or /home/user/.config/inkscape/templates
4.	
Click Save.
5.	
If you restart Inkscape and go to the main menu and select File and then New,  
the new custom template should be in the submenu.

Extensions in Inkscape
[ 212 ]
What just happened?
With a few simple steps, you downloaded new templates for Inkscape, uncompressed those 
files, and saved them to your hard drive. Then, after restarting Inkscape, the new templates 
were installed and available for use.
Creating your own custom templates
If you need to create your own template, or modify one of these existing options, there  
are a few ways you can then save it for use in future projects. Let's see how to start a  
custom template.
Time for action – modifying an existing Inkscape template
To modify an existing template:
1.	
Open the template that most resembles the new one you would like to create.
2.	
Modify the Document Properties (choose File and then Document Properties  
or use the Shift + Ctrl/Option + D keyboard shortcut) or other settings applicable  
to the template you want to create, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 10
[ 213 ]
3.	
From the main menu, choose File and then Save As, choosing to save the file to your 
computer operating system's Inkscape template directory.
4.	
Once saved, restart Inkscape and go to the main menu. Select File and then  
New—and the new custom template should be in the submenu.
What just happened?
We modified an existing template in Inkscape to use as a base for others. We then saved the 
template so we can use it for other projects.
Time for action – creating a custom template
If you want to create a new template from scratch, this is almost as easy:
1.	
Open a new Inkscape file.
2.	
From the main menu, choose File and then Document Properties or use the Shift + 
Ctrl/Option + D keyboard shortcut.
3.	
Adjust all settings applicable to the template you want to create and save the file to 
your computer operating system's Inkscape template directory.
4.	
Once saved, restart Inkscape and go to the main menu. Select File and then  
New—and the new custom template should be in the submenu.
What just happened?
A template file of any kind (used from default, created for your use only, or modified 
templates) contains the document settings and normally does not contain SVG objects. 
When saved in the template folder, you can select the template from the drop-down menu 
for new documents.
In the previous steps, we created a custom template for Inkscape.
What are extensions?
Let's first understand what extensions are in Inkscape. Extensions add new capabilities  
to software programs—thus customizing what you want them to do for you.
When you use scripts with Inkscape, you essentially add new features to the existing 
software. A script takes control of the Inkscape software to perform a certain feature.  
Scripts themselves differ from extensions in that they are usually written in a different 
programming language from the main program (Inkscape in this case) and can be modified  
at any time—mostly by Inkscape developers.

Extensions in Inkscape
[ 214 ]
Extensions "extend" Inkscape's features or functionality .If you used an extension outside 
of inkscape, it wouldn't work correctly. An example of an extension for Inkscape is one that 
allows importing and exporting of non-SVG file types into the program. Most extensions 
require external programs, usually written in Perl or Python.
You can find common extensions here: http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/
ExtensionsRepository#Extensions. Although they are not all-inclusive lists of what is 
available, they give you a healthy start in your search for customizing Inkscape.
Inkscape also comes with some pre-installed extensions. You find these in the main menu. 
Click Extensions and the submenu appears as follows:
Examples of extension tutorials
There are many valuable extensions in Inkscape such as interpolate, scatter, and render. 
Here's a quick look at some tutorials online that can help you understand some of  
these extensions:

Installation extensions
The procedures for installing plugins vary because there are some dependencies on your 
computer's operating system and on what software you already have installed on your 
computer. The best rule of thumb is to read the plugin installation instructions.
Script installation is a bit easier—it requires the script code file itself and an INX file. It is as 
simple as copying both files and placing them into the extension folder directly. In Windows, 
this directory is C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\extensions. In the Mac OS and 
Linux, this is typically in the home/.inkscape/extensions directory.
You should always be sure to read script installation instructions because they often have 
dependencies. For example, they may require additional programs to be installed before 
they can work. If you don't know these dependencies up front, you can try an install and 
then read the error message after you run the script from a command-line interface.
Pop quiz – what are extensions?
True or false: Extensions add new capabilities to Inkscape and thus extend its features or 
functionality and on their own, outside of their use in Inkscape, wouldn't work correctly.
Summary
We dug right in at the start of this chapter and reviewed how to access the pre-installed 
templates in Inkscape. Then we took a look at how to install new templates that we might find 
online. We discussed in detail how to modify a standard template, save it as a custom one, and 
how to start from scratch and save a custom template. We also jumped into learning about 
extensions. Some sample tutorial links were also given to provide examples of how to use 
extensions in Inkscape as well as installing additional ones in Inkscape.

Working with Images
We talked a lot in the first chapter about rasterized versus vectorized images 
and how Inkscape is best used for vector graphics. But what if you only have 
rasterized images? Can you import them into Inkscape, manipulate them, or even 
save them as vector images? Of course you can. There are some minor limitations 
on how you export rasterized images, but this feature is often used to import the 
image and then manipulate it a bit for the vector use you need.
This chapter will focus on:

Importing from the Open Clip Art Library (Linux and Mac users)
The Open Clip Art Library is an open source, free clip art image library that you can search 
directly from Inkscape.
Unfortunately, the Open Clip Art Library menu options do not exist for Windows 
users. However, you can always go to www.openclipart.org in a web browser to  
view all available clip art, download, and then import into your projects.
This clip art library is searchable and most of its graphics can be used in your designs  
as needed (and as seen throughout this book). Let's see how we can use it.

Working with Images
[ 218 ]
Time for action – using the Open Clip Art Library (Mac users only)
Here's how it works:
1.	 In an open Inkscape project, from the main menu, choose File and then Import 
From Open Clip Art Library.
2.	 In the Import From Open Clip Art Library dialog box, in the Search for: field, enter a 
keyword to describe the clip art you want to place in the document and click Search, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
Inkscape then connects to the Open Clip Art Library website. Previews of files  
are shown in a window on the right-hand side of the dialog.
3.	 Try other keyword searches until you find one you like and then double-click  
the name of the image to place it in the document.
What just happened?
You opened the Open Clip Art Library via Inkscape, searched for a clip art image, and placed 
it on an Inkscape canvas.
The clip art library can be useful in a number of ways:


It allows for free use of a number of images that you may like to use in a web design 
mockup, for placement or for end use.


You can also ungroup the pieces of the image and adjust colors, remove items,  
edit the overall image, and use it in your own design:

Chapter 11
[ 219 ]
Importing clip art images can give you a starting point for your own designs—as well as give 
great layout perspective when creating website mockups.
Pop quiz – Open Clip Art
1.	 Graphics downloaded from the Open Clip Art Library are:
a.	 Free to use
b.	 Editable (ungroup, adjust colors, remove items, edit the overall image)
c.	
Downloadable in SVG format
d.	 All of the above
Basics about photo manipulation
Inkscape doesn't allow for extensive photo manipulation, but these filters will work 
with photographs or non-vector based images. These are basic and fun effects for your 
photographic images. Filters that are photo (and bitmap) friendly are:

For some fun, try Scatter and Texture filters and Clip with photographs as well.
Let's walk through using one of these filters in a practical example.
Time for action – blurring the background of a photograph
We will take the same photograph we used from a previous exercise and manipulate it 
differently here.  We will select the foreground that we want to keep crisp, and clear and 
then blur the background. Here are the steps on how this is done:
1.	 Open a new Inkscape document and import a bitmap/photograph you want to use 
for this exercise. From the main menu, select File and then Import.
2.	 Select the correct bitmap file and click Open. Make sure your imported bitmap is 
selected, and then select File and then Document Properties. In the Custom Size 
section, click Resize page to content, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 11
[ 221 ]
3.	 Click Resize page to drawing or selection.
Your document page size will now be adjusted to match that of your imported 
bitmap image, as shown in the following screenshot.
4.	 Select your photograph objects in the window and now choose Edit and Duplicate 
as follows:
5.	 Select and then drag the top duplicate photograph off to the side of the canvas  
as follows:
 
Image credit Photostock at Freedigitalphotos.net
We will need to adjust that one later. It will be our "background" image.

Working with Images
[ 222 ]
6.	 Now we will need to create a clipping mask of the portion of the people we want to 
remain in the foreground of our picture. Select the Bezier tool and trace around the 
people's faces as follows:
7.	 You may need to zoom in to the photo to get a more detailed view to work with.
8.	 Note, when you use the Bezier tool, every time you click-and-drag, a new curve 
node is created.
9.	 You can also create rough shapes and then click between nodes to add new nodes 
and adjust as necessary. An example is shown as follows:
10.	Once you "connect" the last node to the beginning one, it will "close" the tool  
and make a selection:

Chapter 11
[ 223 ]
11.	Now with the traced object and the original photo selected, from the main menu, 
select Object | Clip | Set as follows:

Working with Images
[ 224 ]
12.	You will now see a clip of just the selected portions of the couple that you  
outlined previously:
13.	Select and move the duplicate/background image back into place above the  
clipped image:
14.	To make sure it all aligns properly, click the Align and distribute objects icon in  
the toolbar. The Align and Distribute dialog will appear on the right-hand side of  
your screen as follows:

Chapter 11
[ 225 ]
15.	Make sure the Relative to: field is set to Page and click the align vertically and align 
horizontally icons as follows:

Working with Images
[ 226 ]
16.	Click the X icon in the upper-right corner to close this dialog box.
17.	Choose the Fill and Stroke icon on the toolbar. The Fill and Stroke dialog  
will now also appear on the right-hand side of the screen as follows:
18.	Make sure the full photograph duplicate is still selected on your canvas and move 
the Blur slider bar to the right until you like the blur amount:

Chapter 11
[ 227 ]
19.	Again, with the image still selected, choose the Lower selection to bottom icon in 
the top toolbar as follows:
20.	You will see that this duplicate photograph will now drop behind the clipped image 
and we have a "blurred" background in our photograph!
21.	Now the photo can be saved in a native Inkscape format for future editing or as a 
PNG file and placed in another design. To save this file, from the main menu, select 
File and then Export. Give it a filename and save it within the project file folders.

Working with Images
[ 228 ]
What just happened?
You took a standard photograph, brought it into Inkscape, and edited it so that the 
background was more blurred than the foreground.
We applied some non-destructive clipping and filtering to a photograph. That said, the image 
itself is untouched, and if you want to see the full effects of the background blurring, don't 
forget to export the image as a PNG file (File | Export Bitmap).
To edit the images directly, use the image extensions. Import the photograph and use the 
extensions found in the main menu option: Extensions | Raster.
Converting raster logos to vector-based logos
Many clients might only have their logo images in raster or bitmap formats—JPG, GIF, PNG, 
or BMP, which as we defined in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Vector Graphics, are a grid 
of pixels that are set to certain colors. When these logos are made larger, there's a loss of 
quality (remember the boxey, pixelated look?). Often, you might need to scale a logo larger 
so it fits in your new design and want to maintain smooth edges. You do this by converting it 
to a vector-based image.
Time for action – converting a logo to a vector-based image
Here's how you use Inkscape to convert a raster image logo into an SVG image in vector 
graphic format (that will be scalable!):
1.	 Open the logo you want to convert in Inkscape. Whenever possible use an image 
that is of as high resolution as possible. This will ensure the best possible recreation 
of the logo. You can see from the enlarged screenshot that the edges are not 
smooth, as shown in the following image:
2.	 Select the entire image (Edit and then Select All) and then perform a trace by 
choosing Path and then Trace Bitmap.
3.	 In the Trace Bitmap dialog box, select Multiscan Colors as the mode and be sure 
that Smooth is unchecked. The Scans can be set to 15.

Chapter 11
[ 229 ]
4.	 Click OK to start the conversion.
5.	 (Optional step) As needed, adjust the new vector conversion of the image.  
Add, move, and adjust the nodes to match the original raster more closely.
6.	 Next you need to delete your original image. From the main menu, select Object 
and then Lower—you will now see that your new vector image was "lowered" 
beneath the original jagged-edged image.
7.	 Select the original image and then press the Delete key on your keyboard.  
Your new vector image should be viewable as follows:
8.	 Tracing the image may not be enough to fully recreate the logo. Further  
clean-up and coloring of the image may still be required to obtain a  
high-quality logo.
9.	 Save this new file (choose File and then Save As… ) with a new descriptive filename 
and be sure that the file type in the bottom-right is Inkscape SVG.
What just happened?
You took a logo file in JPG format and converted it into an Inkscape vector image that can be 
scaled larger (or smaller) and used like all vector graphics.
Summary
In this chapter, we learned a lot about working with images—raster and vector—in Inkscape. 
We looked at importing bitmap images, embedding images, rendering bitmap images, 
working a bit with photographs and filters, importing clip art, and all the tips and tricks for 
"tracing" bitmap images to convert them into full vector graphics for both photographs and 
logos. Now we can recreate all of those non-editable images and make them resizable and 
thus enhance our current design projects.

Using the XML Editor
Now we're ready to dig, just a little bit, into some code. We're going to learn 
about the XML Editor that is included within Inkscape. This feature helps us 
perform cool tricks that can help with global changes in web development 
and when working with a programming team that can also create scripts to 
automatically make some changes.
The goals of this chapter are to:


Learn how to access the XML Editor


Understand the basics of the SVG coding language Inkscape uses (which is an 
iteration of XML)


Learn how to edit some of the object XML code


Review the essentials for handing off files to make sure the XML/SVG code can be 
fully-functional and usable for any backend programming that needs to be done.
Let's first learn a bit about the editor.
Inkscape's XML Editor
One of the features that sets Inkscape apart from other vector graphics programs is the 
XML Editor. The XML Editor is a code-based version of your canvas, all objects, properties, 
and more. Within the XML Editor, you can change any aspect of the document and see it 
immediately reflected on your canvas.

Using the XML Editor
[ 232 ]
The catch here is you need to learn a bit of SVG code in order to be able to do this fun 
editing. And, if you learn it, you can do even more within the XML interface than you can 
through the main Inkscape interface as it stands today. But, again, it takes a bit of learning on 
your part to learn SVG attributes and how best to edit them for your needs. To start, you can 
view the W3C web site (http://www.w3.org/) directly from Inkscape at any time to see 
the SVG specifications. From the main menu, select Help and then SVG 1.1 Specification.
Understanding and using the SVG code allows you to create consistent shadows for objects 
in your web page design without having to fiddle with a number of menus and settings, or 
create rectangles that always have the same rounded corners—again, without menus, fields 
and settings. However, let's just start at the beginning and open the XML Editor.
Time for action – accessing the XML Editor
To begin we will open the XML editor in Inkscape:
1.	 Accessing the XML Editor is the easy part. From any open Inkscape document,  
on the main menu, select Edit and then XML Editor.

Chapter 12
[ 233 ]
 You can also open the XML Editor using the keyboard 
shortcut Shift+Ctrl+X.
What just happened?
The XML window opened, and if your Inkscape canvas is blank, it will look something like the 
following screenshot:
On the left-hand side of this screen is the SVG code and on the right-hand side of the screen 
you see the attributes and values associated with the selected line of code. You can also 
select line items on the right-hand side of the screen and reset the values—in essence, 
editing the code directly.

Using the XML Editor
[ 234 ]
XML Editor basics
Let's look at a more complicated Inkscape document that is populated with a web design. 
Then we can discuss the screen basics, the SVG code, and understand how we might be able 
to edit it for our use. The following screenshot shows the open Inkscape document and the 
associated SVG code, side-by-side.
As you select items in the SVG code, you will see that Inkscape selects the items in the design 
(and vice versa). Also, if you were to edit any of the object properties, all changes would 
happen in real time on the canvas. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. First we need to 
understand the basics of the XML Editor screen:


The structure or tree of the XML is shown on the left-hand side of the screen  
(see the following screenshot). This XML tree is the entire canvas shown in  
SVG code.

Chapter 12
[ 235 ]


A layer is essentially a node in the tree. If the layer contained drawn objects, there 
would be additional nodes embedded beneath the layer node. Each node represents 
an object on that layer.
These nodes are expandable by clicking the arrow on the left-hand side. When 
pointing down, all objects are viewable (and editable). When the arrow is sideways, 
the objects are hidden.

The attributes or properties of a selected object are on the right-hand side of the 
screen. This is where you would edit the properties.
You select an attribute of the object to edit, and then in the bottom portion of the 
screen, you make your changes and click the Set button to commit to the change,  
as seen in the following screenshot:

SVG basics
Let's take a step back for a moment and understand the attributes—or the SVG code—found 
in the XML Editor. We'll still keep it in the context of the Inkscape XML Editor window, so you 
won't have to know all of the SVG syntax code, but still enough to understand the common 
attributes and what they mean to your web designs.
Attribute types
First, attributes fall into two categories: those that are SVG standard attributes and then 
those that can only be found in Inkscape. For those that fall within the SVG standards, they 
will be recognized by other SVG-rendering programs, and thus can be edited by them as well. 
However the others—the Inkscape only attributes—are only recognized in Inkscape. What 
does this mean if you export and use them in other SVG-rendering programs? Not much, 
they'll just be ignored. Alternatively, you can export the drawing in a way that will not even 
include these elements.
Thus, when you are saving a document in Inkscape, you are given the option to save as 
Inkscape SVG or Plain SVG.
To maintain editability, we recommend saving in Inkscape SVG.
How can you can tell which attributes are Inkscape only and which are SVG standard? The 
sodipodi tagis found only on attributes that are Inkscape only. The sodipodi tag comes from 
the roots of the Inkscape application. It was branched from the Sodipodi program and thus 
the sodipodi tag in the SVG editor.

Using the XML Editor
[ 238 ]
In the following example, you can see that the icon's width (sodipodi: rx) and height 
(sodipodi: ry) are both Inkscape-native SVG code. The circle attribute cx gives the exact 
location of the Circle's Height Transformation node and cy gives the position of the Circle's 
Width Transformation node.

Basic attributes
There are books that can explain how best to code and script using SVG. Here, we  
will aim to give you a very brief overview of the code and how you can read it, and the  
attribute properties.
This isn't intended to show you how to hand-code the SVG data, as it is rarely done that 
way. As with Inkscape, you would use an SVG-authoring environment with a graphical 
interface that creates most of the code and then you would go in later and edit the attribute 
information. But even with this, it helps to understand the very basics of the attribute 
properties and how they are structured.
To start, we will discuss objects. SVG offers four data types to work with; namely, paths, 
shapes, images, and text. For each of these objects, you have a number of attributes you 
define to actually create, define, and position the images you see on the canvas.

Chapter 12
[ 239 ]
Paths
In SVG (and Inkscape), paths are outlines of shapes. These paths can be filled (add color) 
and/or have a stroke associated with them—and thus paths are critical objects to create 
shapes and other items in Inkscape.
Shapes
How does SVG allow you to create all these pictures? Well, each object is made up of  
a number of shapes. And thus, SVG also uses six predefined shape elements within its  
code for you to manipulate. These basic shape elements are:


rectangle (rect)


circle


ellipse


line


polyline


polygon
Each SVG shape has a number of attributes associated with it and once those attributes  
are defined, the code can be made into an actual shape. Let's go through each of these  
as an example.
Rectangles have four attributes—x, y, width, and height—which define the placement 
and dimensions of the rectangle. The x attribute is the distance from the left-hand side of 
the canvas, the y attribute is the distance from the top of the canvas. Using x and y together, 
you are defining the top-left corner of the rectangle. This leaves the width and height 
attributes—and, they define exactly what you would assume: the dimensions of the two 
dimensional object.
Here's how you would see the code in the XML Editor:

Using the XML Editor
[ 240 ]
Notice the rect ID <svg:rect id=rect2816> is the object information, and is shown on 
the left-hand side, whereas all of the attributes (x, y, height, and width) are shown on the 
right-hand side. There is also an id and style attribute which is common to all objects. The 
id attribute is either automatically assigned in Inkscape or set when making the object in the 
graphical interface (from the main menu, choose Object | Object Properties).
The Id field (highlighted above) can be changed and thus reflected in the SVG code.
Back in the XML Editor, the style attribute captures all of the color, stroke, opacity,  
fill information, and more. As you select any attribute, you can see all the details in the 
bottom of the screen (this is where you would edit that information, too).
What would the rectangle, as seen in this SVG code example, look like? See the  
following screenshot:

Chapter 12
[ 241 ]
Next let's discuss a circle. It uses the pathid to create it and has four attributes: cx, cy, rx 
and ry. The cx and cy attributes define the exact center of the circle (placement), while the 
rx and ry values are the radii of the circle. An example of the SVG code in the XML Editor 
would look similar to the following screenshot:
From this code, we see that the center of the circle is at 100, 50 and the circle would have a 
radius of 40. We can also see from the style attribute that there is color in the circle, but it 
is at 40 percent capacity and has a stroke outline that is 2 pixels thick.
On the canvas, this all translates into a circle looking similar to the following screenshot:

Using the XML Editor
[ 242 ]
The ellipse is similar to the circle, except that it has four path id attributes in Inkscape: cx,  
cy, rx, and ry. Again, cx and cy specify the center of the ellipse. The r attributes—rx 
and ry—give the x-axis and y-axis radii of the ellipse. Again, unless geometry is a favorite 
pastime, typically you would create this object using the graphical interface and then refine  
it in the XML Editor code. So, let's see what the code would look like:
We see here, for this example, the center of the circle is at 110, 55 and it has an x-axis radius 
of 70 and y-axis radius of 35.
The ellipse would look similar to the following on the canvas:

Chapter 12
[ 243 ]
Next up, we will learn about the path object. Essentially, you will map every "point" or node 
on the object. That means you will have many x and y coordinate pairs in the code for these 
types of objects. Here's a sample of the code in the XML Editor:
And here is the corresponding line on the canvas:
Now for the details about polylines and polygons. The attributes are the same as those of  
the path object. Every point or node on the object is mapped with x and y coordinate pairs  
in the code for these types of objects.
But what is the difference between polygons and polylines if the attributes are the same  
(an x and y value for every node of the shape)? It's the stroke outline—for polylines, it 
doesn't automatically close the shape as the polygon element automatically does.

Using the XML Editor
[ 244 ]
Here's a simple code example for a polyline (again, this would be the same for a polygon, 
except the stroke would close the shape:
This is how it would look on the canvas:
With this example, you can see how difficult it would be to hand-code all of the nodes of 
the star to make the image. In fact, you would be likely to spend more time trying to find 
coordinates and mapping them instead of actually drawing the shapes. This is why Inkscape's 
interface is best for drawing and using the XML Editor to edit or manage some settings which 
we'll talk about next.
You always have to make sure you have an even number of coordinate 
values, meaning, for every x value you have, you must specify a 
corresponding y coordinate. SVG coding programs will prompt you for 
this and in Inkscape, it is recommended you draw the graphics using the 
interface and then go into the XML Editor to change any specific settings.

Chapter 12
[ 245 ]
Images
As you have seen, SVG files are considered the source files for Inkscape. They are graphic 
images themselves, but they can also contain other graphic formats (such as PNG, JPG, or 
other SVG files). You can even transform and animate those graphics as well (and even use 
some scripting to work with them).
In order to do all of that, there is an image object in Inkscape. The attributes for it  
are: x and y, which again define the top-left corner of the image; width, and height 
attributes that give measurements; and the xlink:href attribute which defines the  
actual path or location of the original image. Think of it as the link to the original image  
file, as in HTML code.
A code sample in the XML Editor will look similar to the following screenshot:
Text
Lastly, as you know from the many examples we have created so far, you can create text in 
your drawings. Much like the image attribute, there are x and y values that set the top-left/
starting point for your text and then the actual text that is displayed. Here's a sample of what 
that looks like in the XML Editor:

Using the XML Editor
[ 246 ]
Using the XML Editor to change characteristics
Now, suppose you have created a mock website using the graphical interface of Inkscape and 
you have handed off all of your files to the programming team. Suddenly, your client decides 
that they want all heading text to be a specific color of gray (4d4d4d).
Do you have to open each graphic file and make this change? Maybe. But you can also 
change it right in the XML Editor (and if your programmers are using your SVG files directly, 
they might even be able to make the change).
Time for action – using the XML Editor to change object 
characteristics
Here's how you would use the XML Editor to change heading text to a specific web color:
1.	 Open up the XML Editor (or an SVG authoring tool) and open your website file.
2.	 Find the headings you want to change. To do this, find text objects that match what 
you are looking for. Programmers may have named all of these HeadingXX, where 
XX is a number to identify each of them.

Chapter 12
[ 247 ]
3.	 Expand the object and find the style attribute.
4.	 Then look for the fill information and change that web color to the new gray one: 
4d4d4d.
5.	 Click on Set.
What just happened?
You changed the heading text characteristics so that it is now gray in color, as seen in the 
following screenshot:

Using the XML Editor
[ 248 ]
You can even write scripts that are able to automatically search and find all heading IDs  
(as described in step number 2) and change them! Work with your programming team if you 
want to learn how to do this. Lots of tools can help you learn the XML/SVG code side of this.
The main use for the XML Editor is to correct flaws that cannot be corrected through the 
interface or through advanced features (which do not have a menu item). An example of this 
is applying a filter and having the boundaries chopping off a part of the visual output due to 
the offset. For more examples, see some online tutorials here: http://tavmjong.free.
fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/XML-Examples.html
Using XML and graphics with programmers
XML, SVG code, and scripting typically land in the laps of those who actually code the web 
page. Sometimes they can all be the same person—but in larger corporate or consulting 
groups, it is a split responsibility. And the one major point to remember is that when you 
hand off your design mockup files, you include everything!
All SVG source files, all output PNG files, every graphic you used to create the mockup, and 
more. And in fact, if you created object properties (names) for your layers and objects—give 
the programming team a cheat sheet of that information as well. All of this will make the 
transition from web design mockup to real web page easier, cleaner, and more efficient.
Summary
This chapter was full of the technical—XML and SVG code, objects, attributes, x and y values, 
and more. First we learned how to open the XML Editor. Then we took a step back and 
learned a bit about SVG coding; all about the shape, image, and text attributes. We even dug 
further into the code a bit to edit some text. Of course, there is a lot more that can be done 
with the code version of your graphics—but we left most of that to a programming team, or 
for more investigative work on your part.

Glossary of Terms
Alignment makes sure all of the elements line up on the screen. Use natural alignments 
within an entire web space when you use more than one graphical element such as photos, 
graphics, and/or text.
Attributes are the properties of an object, as seen in the Inkscape XML editor. Selecting an 
attribute (such as stroke or fill) will then let you see the detailed properties (such as color 
codes and line thicknesses).
Backgrounds are "behind" the overall design of a web page. They can be any design, shape, 
size, or color, but as a rule of thumb, should not distract from the overall design of a web page.
Blogs, now commonplace on the web, are websites or portions of websites that  
offer commentary on personal events, politics, videos, pictures, and anything  
else that can be "posted" online. The structure of blogs is around posts that are  
published in reverse-chronological order and allow readers to provide comments  
and sometimes ratings.
Buttons are used on forms found in web pages where a user needs to "submit" information 
that will be stored.
Canvas is the page or document in Inkscape where your objects and shapes are created.
Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is used with the HTML/XML coding to define the look  
and formatting of an entire website. One style sheet determines fonts, colors,  
spacing, placement, and more, reducing complexity and repetition in the coding  
of the pages themselves.
Contrast is a state of being different from something else, for example, abstractly different 
sizes, colors, directions, shapes and fonts (for example mixing modern with old style), font 
weights, and more.

Glossary of Terms
[ 258 ]
Diagram is a graphical representation of information that uses shapes, images, and more 
to create a cohesive thought. There are a number of diagram types like Venn, Activity, Tree, 
Network, and more.
Dialogs are vernacularly used in Inkscape to describe specific windows or portions of  
the screens.
Extensions in the world of Inkscape are like scripts. They are created, installed, and  
then incorporated into the Inkscape software itself to "extend" the software's features  
or functionality.
Fill is the terminology to describe the color of an object or shape.
Font when using text, it specifies a certain size and style of type.
Flow Chart is one of the most common types of diagrams. It shows the general process  
for completing a task or decision. It shows each step, decision, and option as a particular 
box/option/connector. In general, it represents a step-by-step solution to a given problem.
GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an open source photo manipulation software 
program. This is used in this book for the process of creating an animated GIF. More 
information can be found at: http://www.gimp.org.
Grid is a tool in Inkscape to help alignment and exact measurements. It can be particularly 
useful in creating web page designs because there are "snap to grid" options to help with 
exact alignment.
Guides are also tools in Inkscape in Inkscape that can be user-generated. You can create 
guides on your canvas to help with alignment and object placement.
Handle is a term used to describe small squares or circles at edges of an object in Inkscape. 
Handles are often used to change the size of an object or change the shape of a path.
Icons is a graphical representation of text, usually smaller objects that represent a certain 
feature or function on a web page. They can be completely graphical or a combination of 
graphics and text.
Layers  in the Inkscape software allow stacking of objects on a canvas for easier creation. 
Each layer can be locked, viewed, moved, and more. You must select a layer before you  
can start manipulating objects within that layer. This selected layer is then termed the 
drawing layer.
Lock is used to lock objects, shapes, text, and layers in Inkscape. Once this setting is in place, 
these objects become un-editable until unlocked.
Logo is a visual representation of a company or brand.

Appendix C
[ 259 ]
Lorem Ipsum is a text effect that displays a pseudo-Latin form of text that is used as a 
"placeholder" in the larger context of the web page design. It allows visual correlation  
of text content, without having to create actual text for that space in the design.
Open Clip Art Library is an open source, free clip art image library that you can search 
directly from Inkscape.
Organizational Chart or "org chart" shows the structure of an organization. It also details 
roles, job titles, and sometimes the relationships between the jobs.
Panning is moving left, right, or up and down on the Inkscape main screen.
Paths in general terms, are lines that have a start and end point, curves, angles, and points  
that are calculated by a mathematical equation. However, paths are not limited to being 
straight—they can be of any shape, size, and can even encompass any number of curves.  
When you combine them, they create drawings, diagrams, and can even help create  
certain fonts.
Plugins are additional software that you install to add new capabilities to Inkscape.
Properties define details regarding an object created in Inkscape. These are typically  
editable and can be changed with the software interface or within the XML editor.
Proximity is a design term used to describe grouping of similar information together  
on a web page.
Rasterized images are images that are created by tiny rectangular dots, which we call pixels. 
File types like JPG, FIG, and BMP are all rasterized images.
Repetition the idea of repeating elements like buttons, shapes (graphical or just placement), 
or colors in a design to make a pleasing impact.
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds is a basic way to continually broadcast (or publish) 
blog entries. These feeds are in a standardized XML format and pull the metadata tags 
you assigned when publishing your blog post and display them in "readers" for others to 
automatically receive.
Scalable Vector Graphics or SVG­ is a vector-based drawing language that uses some basic 
principles: it can be scalable to any size without losing detail, and a drawing can use an 
unlimited number of smaller drawings used in any number of ways (and reused) and still  
be a part of a larger whole.
Scan is a process Inkscape uses to describe a "pass" over a bitmap image in order to create 
a trace of the image. Single scans are done with a single pass (or scan) to create the paths. 
Multiple scans, in turn, use multiple passes using different settings each time to create 
different paths that are then stored and displayed in a group to create the trace.

Glossary of Terms
[ 260 ]
Scripts add new features to Inkscape. They must be installed after the initial Inkscape 
installation and are typically written in a different programming language from the main 
program (Inkscape, in this case) and can be modified at any time.
Shapes in Inkcape and SVG, are basic shape elements; these include rectangles, circles, 
ellipses, straight lines, polylines, and polygons. They have different attributes from paths, and 
can have fill and stroke information edited via the software interface as well as with the XML 
editor directly.
SIOX (Simple Interactive Object Extraction) is a process of separating an object from the 
background in a bitmap image.
Site tree/Site Map is a list of all the individual pages of a website. Typically, the site map 
outlines how each page is linked to the others. It can be used for website creation and, 
planning, but also as a user interface aide to help website users find where they need  
to be on the site.
Storefronts are any websites that sell a commodity. They often allow you to search through 
products and then purchase a product through a "shopping cart".
Stroke is the term in Inkscape to describe an object or shape border. You can often change 
the stroke color and thickness.
Template is a base document that has been created to simplify the design process. Basic 
settings like canvas size, fonts, colors, and placement are pre-defined and set in the document.
Text styling is the term used to describe manipulating text, so that it creates a certain feel 
when seen in an overall design. Sometimes it is also called typography or typesetting.
Tracing is the process of creating paths (and nodes) to represent an underlying bitmap image 
and then using those paths to create a vector-based image.
Vector graphics is the use of points, lines, curves, and shapes or polygons, which are all 
based on mathematical equations to represent images in computer graphics.
Wallpapers are images used as desktop backgrounds. These are also commonly used  
(and downloaded) for use with cell phones and other electronic devices.
XML Editor is the code-based version of objects and drawings on your Inkscape canvas. 
Within the XML Editor, you can change any aspect of the document and see it immediately 
reflected on your canvas.
Zoom describes magnifying your canvas to see more detail (zoomed in) or the entire canvas 
at a glance (zoomed out).

Chapter 4, Creating your First Graphics
Pop quiz – displaying borders
1
a
Since a border is essentially the end of your graphic 
you can use it for a number of purposes—most 
importantly to show the boundary for where you 
can create graphics that will be printed or exported 
when your file is saved.
Pop quiz – switching shapes

You would use the toolbox and select the cube 
icon (6th icon from the top).

about this, grouping, and combining paths will be 
discussed in Chapter 7, Creating paths into complex

Pop quiz – background colors

All Inkscape files are transparent by 
default. We had set the document 
properties to have a white solid 
background for our web design mockup 
so that it would be consistent with how 
the web page would be coded.

Chapter 6, Building Objects
Pop quiz – changing Fill and Stroke
TRUE or FALSE: No matter what 
way you use to change fill and 
stroke of an object in Inkscape, it 
all has the same outcome for the 
object on your canvas.
TRUE.
By using the Fill and Stroke dialog, 
the dropper tool, or the color 
palette you are changing the same 
attributes on the object.

Chapter 7, Using Paths
Pop quiz – remove the last node movement
1
d
Either using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Z 
or Edit | Undo works!
Pop quiz – paths
1
d
Almost any object you create in Inkscape can be 
converted to a path so you can add effects or 
move nodes to get the desired effect
Chapter 8, How to Style Text
Pop quiz – font options
1
e
There is no option to underline in Inkscape. 
Instead you can use other tools to draw a line 
under any text you wish to have underlined.
Pop Quiz – transparency
1
b
It is actually transparent. For a mask to work, 
like in the example in this chapter, you need to 
change the Alpha setting to white. Masking takes 
the shades of gray onto the “bottom” object. If 
the Alpha setting was set at transparent then the 
reflection would also be transparent.

b
All the others listed can be seen in the icon 
preview option in Inkscape (View | Icon 
Preview).
Chapter 10, Extensions in Inkscape
Pop quiz – what are extensions?
TRUE OR FALSE: Extensions add 
new capabilities to Inkscape 
and thus extend its features or 
functionality and on their own, 
outside of their use in Inkscape, 
wouldn’t work correctly.
TRUE.
Most Inkscape extensions are 
created using Python or Perl 
programming languages.
Chapter 11, Working with Images
Pop quiz – Open Clip Art
1
d
You can indeed use any image from the Open Clip 
Art Library in your work—all are downloadable in 
SVG format, editable, and you can adjust them as 
necessary for your own designs.

Chapter 12, Using the XML Editor
Pop quiz – sodipodi tag
1
a
The sodipodi tag is the only one attribute that 
is Inkscape-only. It comes from the roots of the 
Inkscape application which was branched from 
the Sodipodi program, and thus the sodipodi tag 
in the SVG editor.

About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book "Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective 
MySQL Management" in April 2004 and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing 
highly focused books on specific technologies and solutions.
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting 
and customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution based books 
give you the knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're 
using to get the job done. Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books 
you have seen in the past. Our unique business model allows us to bring you more focused 
information, giving you more of what you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern, yet unique publishing company, which focuses on producing quality, 
cutting-edge books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike. For 
more information, please visit our website: www.packtpub.com.
About Packt Open Source
In 2010, Packt launched two new brands, Packt Open Source and Packt Enterprise, in order 
to continue its focus on specialization. This book is part of the Packt Open Source brand, 
home to books published on software built around Open Source licences, and offering 
information to anybody from advanced developers to budding web designers. The Open 
Source brand also runs Packt's Open Source Royalty Scheme, by which Packt gives a royalty 
to each Open Source project about whose software a book is sold.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals 
should be sent to author@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and you 
would like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, contact us; one of our 
commissioning editors will get in touch with you. 
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get 
some additional reward for your expertise.
