How Apple File System works with
older Macs, encryption, external
drives, and other questions
BY GLENN FLEISHMAN
MACUSER
News and Analysis About 
Macs, OS X, and Apple
W
ith the release of macOS 
High Sierra and its upgrade 
for SSD-based startup 
volumes to Apple File 
System (APFS), Macworld readers had 
many questions about how this new 
filesystem—more efficient and reliable for 
SSDs—will interact with older Macs, hard 
drives, networked filesharing, and more. 
Here are the answers.
Many questions revolve around a 
concern that files stored on an APFS-
IMAGE: APPLE

8   MACWORLD   DECEMBER 2017
MACUSER
HOW APPLE FILE SYSTEM WORKS
formatted volume won’t be readable or 
usable elsewhere. Generally, a filesystem 
structure only affects the way in which 
documents are stored on a drive. When 
the files are retrieved, they’re independent 
of that format and can handle just as they 
would in any other case, like downloading 
a file from a website.
CAN I OPT TO NOT INSTALL 
APFS?
No. It’s mandatory on SSDs when you 
upgrade to High Sierra. Fusion drive 
support (Apple’s hybrid SSD and HDD 
combo) is coming and, we assume, 
mandatory with the upgrade that carries it.
IS APFS A REASON TO AVOID 
UPGRADING TO HIGH SIERRA 
FOR NOW?
Opinions vary. It’s an entirely new 
filesystem if you have an SSD startup 
drive, and I generally recommend most 
people wait until there’s a “dot” release, in 
this case 10.13.1 or even 10.13.2, to ensure 
any glitches found by early adopters are 
fixed without your living through the 
experience. (Since some games and 
software, like Adobe InDesign [go.
macworld.com/adin], aren’t working 
correctly with High Sierra at the moment, 
that’s another reason to delay.)
ONCE HIGH SIERRA 
UPGRADES MY STARTUP 
VOLUME APFS, CAN I REVERT 
TO HFS+?
A reader having problems after upgrading 
to High Sierra wonders if APFS is the 
problem and, if so, can they revert? You 
can’t: High Sierra doesn’t have a back-out 
mechanism. You should make a clone (see 
next entry) if you want to have the option 
to revert back to Sierra. This will require 
wiping the drive, reformatting it, and then 
restoring the clone.
CAN I USE CLONING 
SOFTWARE TO BACK UP 
MY DRIVE?
Yes, but with provisos. Folks who 
develop cloning software for macOS are 
on the front lines of coping with these 
changes. Dave Nanian of Shirt Pocket, 
makers of SuperDuper, 
has a beta release out 
(free to existing 
owners) that supports 
APFS volumes, but on 
his blog he advises 
general users against 
If you clone your drive routinely, make a full 
clone before you upgrade, because otherwise 
you won’t be able to revert on an APFS drive 
to a previous system that uses HFS+. 

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   9
upgrading yet (go.macworld.com/shpo). 
Bombich’s Carbon Copy Cloner (go.
macworld.com/cacc), the other popular 
drive cloning app, has a release version 
that supports APFS, but notes (as Shirt 
Pocket does) that Apple has left some 
features undocumented, and has a long 
list of resources to read before upgrading.
If you clone your drive routinely, make 
a full clone before you upgrade, because 
otherwise you won’t be able to revert on 
an APFS drive to a previous system that 
uses HFS+. It also gives you a clean revert 
position in case of an upgrade failure.
You should also upgrade your clone 
target to APFS for reasons of like-to-like 
compatibility, and if you want to have a 
bootable High Sierra volume. It’s not 
mandatory, but it’s a good idea. (See 
below on converting external drives.)
I would advise people who rely on 
clones as one leg of their backup process—
something I strongly recommend—to delay 
upgrading to High Sierra until both major 
clone-software companies express 
satisfaction with the state of documentation 
and stability on their blogs.
HOW DO I MOVE DATA FROM 
AN APFS VOLUME TO A 
NON-APFS VOLUME OR 
AN OLDER MAC?
You’ve got many, many choices:
> Attach an HFS+ (or other supported 
format) external drive to your Mac, and 

10   MACWORLD   DECEMBER 2017
MACUSER
HOW APPLE FILE SYSTEM WORKS
copy files to that drive. Eject that drive and 
move it to the other Mac.
> Turn filesharing on for your High 
Sierra Mac, and mount it as a volume on 
the older Mac.
> Use AirDrop. (It sometimes works!)
> Use Dropbox, SFTP, SMB, email, or any 
other networked file transmission technol-
ogy to mount a remote volume, sync with a 
directory, or send a file or files. (APFS drives 
apparently can’t be shared over the 
now-outdated Apple Filing Protocol.)
WILL APPLE STOP 
SUPPORTING HFS+?
Not for many years, because of the tens of 
millions of systems out there. It would be 
foolhardy and it’s unnecessary. It will likely 
provide more and more reasons in future 
releases for external drives to move to 
APFS, like requiring APFS drives for Time 
Machine. But I can’t imagine that HFS+ will 
be unmountable in macOS anytime in the 
next three years, and it 
will very likely remain 
possible for years after 
that—although Apple 
could only support 
read-only HFS+ mounting 
at that point. Effectively, 
Apple would want the 
large majority of Macs in 
use to be capable of 
being upgraded to at 
least Sierra, which can read and write 
APFS volumes, before it stopped including 
read/write HFS+ support.
SHOULD I UPGRADE MY 
EXTERNAL VOLUMES TO APFS?
You can upgrade external drives that 
use either SSDs or hard drives, but not 
Fusion drives. However, there are no 
advantages for hard drives, so I would 
recommend against it.
If you have an external SSD that is only 
used for storage, the advantage is likely 
not high enough to give up compatibility if 
you ever think you would want to remove 
that external SSD and use it with a pre-
Sierra Mac. See our instructions on using 
Disk Utility to upgrade an external SSD 
(go.macworld.com/xssd). 
There’s also some concern with how 
High Sierra’s initial release handles 
external drives that have encryption 
enabled (go.macworld.com/enen), a 

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   11
feature that’s separate
from FileVault, which 
only encrypts the 
startup volume.
SHOULD I  
TURN ON 
ENCRYPTION ON AN 
EXTERNAL HFS+ DRIVE IN 
HIGH SIERRA?
No! Apparently, an unexpected behavior in 
this first release is that using the Finder-
based option to encrypt a mounted 
physical drive converts HFS+ drives to 
APFS without warning. (That’s when you 
select a volume, right-click, and choose 
Encrypt DriveName.)
CAN I MOUNT AN APFS 
VOLUME ON A MAC RUNNING 
AN OLDER VERSION OF macOS 
THAN HIGH SIERRA?
Only Sierra, which can read and write 
APFS volumes. While Apple says in its 
APFS FAQ (go.macworld.com/sfpa), “For 
example, a USB storage device formatted 
as APFS can be read by a Mac using High 
Sierra, but not by a Mac using Sierra or 
earlier,” this seems incorrect, as we’d 
heard from other Mac experts that Sierra 
could. We tested with a USB-connected 
SSD drive, and we can read and write to 
an APFS partition.
One reader asked if Apple might 
release a compatibility upgrade for
pre-Sierra OS X and macOS releases to 
allow them to mount APFS externally. My 
definitive answer is also no (though I don’t 
know Apple’s mind). APFS is a 
fundamental reworking of the filesystem, 
which requires extensive changes to the 
OS. I can’t see a trivial way to allow this to 
propagate backward, even if Apple were 
in the habit of releasing upgrades for older 
macOS releases except for security 
reasons or Safari updates.
A third-party might be able to use the 
APFS spec to allow mounting such 
volumes, but there seems to be little 
market for what would be an expensive 
product to develop and support only for an 
ever-smaller number of users of older 
macOS flavors who also had upgraded 
boot or external drives in High Sierra or 
later releases to use APFS.
APPLE SAYS ENCRYPTION IS 
BUILT INTO APFS. CAN I TURN 
FILEVAULT OFF?
No. Apple tries to simplify security 
explanations, and I fear the way it has 
Apparently, an unexpected behavior in this first 
release is that using the Finder-based option 
to encrypt a mounted physical drive converts 
HFS+ drives to APFS without warning. 

12   MACWORLD   DECEMBER 2017
MACUSER
HOW APPLE FILE SYSTEM WORKS
marketed APFS may confuse people, 
since a few readers have already asked 
this. With HFS+, the long-running previous 
format, encryption was applied as a layer 
external to the format. This required more 
intermediation between the operating 
system and the underlying files when 
FileVault was enabled.
With APFS, encryption is an inherent 
property that can be turned on and 
negotiated at the filesystem level. That 
should make it less likely that things could 
go wrong, and should be more efficient. 
As a FileVault user, don’t disable the 
feature, but you shouldn’t notice any 
differences in everyday use.
ARE MY TIME MACHINE 
BACKUPS OF AN APFS 
VOLUME ALSO IN APFS 
FORMAT?
No. HFS+, APFS, FAT32, and other formats 
affect how data is laid out in a disk 
partition. It doesn’t affect information read 
from a drive. If your Time Machine drive 
has HFS+ partitions, those will remain in 
HFS+ format.
Apple says that a feature of APFS 
allows creating snapshots of an entire file 
system at a given moment in time, which 
Time Machine will rely on in High Sierra 
for mobile backups, which are the 
interim Time Machine versions stored on 
your computer when it’s not connected 
to a Time Machine volume or network 
with a Time Machine server or Time 
Capsule on it.
IF I HAVE APFS ON ALL MY  
iOS DEVICES AND MACS,  
ARE iCLOUD FILES NOW 
ENCRYPTED AT A DEVICE 
LEVEL?
Readers wondered if APFS’s ability to use 
encryption natively meant that files were 
stored in a different fashion when synced 
among devices all connected to iCloud. 
They are not. iCloud remains encrypted 
in transit and among your devices, but 
Apple holds all the encryption keys for 
contacts, events, photos, mail, and other 
data that you can access at iCloud.com 
when you log in.
iCloud Keychain remains encrypted 
end-to-end by devices. The new facial-
identification sync system in iOS 11 and High 
Sierra also syncs via iCloud, but is encrypted 
in a fashion in which Apple doesn’t have a 
way to decrypt the data in transit. 
Device-based storage (data encrypted 
at rest) can’t per se be end-to-end, 
because it has to be decrypted and read 
to be acted upon by the local device, like 
a Mac. End-to-end encryption is typically 
between the operating system acting 
upon data on your device and another 
operating system on the other end at a 
destination. ■

Apple Photos 3: The changes,  
new features, and improvements 
you should know about   
BY GLENN FLEISHMAN

APPLE PHOTOS 3
afoul of them have been 
smoothed down.
But Photos has come a 
long way since its first release 
in April 2015 (go.macworld.
com/ap15). That initial foray at 
replacing iPhoto with 
something fresher, faster, and 
better often fell short, because 
it was missing many features 
that people relied on with 
iPhoto. Apple released regular 
updates, however, and 
features returned, new ones 
appeared, and existing ones matured. 
Some people still hate it—I get emails—but 
it settled down for the most part.
For example, those who have emailed 
me asking how to force an alphabetical 
listing of albums in the Photos sidebar will 
be absolutely delighted. The sidebar now 
organizes albums into Media Types (things 
like Slo-Mo, Selfies, and the like) and My 
Albums, which comprises everything 
you’ve created. You can nest folders in My 
Albums as before. Right-click on My 
Albums, and you can choose Sort By, and 
select among name, oldest first, or newest 
first. Bonus: Any of those nested folders 
you create to organize albums can also be 
sorted separately by those criteria through 
a similar right-click.
Let’s dig deeper into how Photos has 
changed.
PHOTOS’ MEMORIES LOOK 
LIKE HUMAN MEMORIES
Introduced last year, Photos’ Memories 
feature collects photos around a location, 
a time or holiday, or a theme determined in 
part by machine learning, which also then 
highlights the photos in that assembled set 
that it thinks are most representative.
Let’s just say it could be fairly 
haphazard in the previous version, 
producing some howlers in terms of odd 
photos chosen—sometimes blurry or 
nearly empty—and not quite getting what 
might have made that period significant.
The improved Memories feature shows 
what seems to be a better selection of 
photos, probably by working harder to find 
common sets of faces and perform 
sentiment analysis to find smiles and 
people looking at the camera. On average, 
The general Photos interface is more legible, has better 
differentiation of features, and in its persistent sidebar 
organizes features and albums better, too.

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   15
they seem less bizarre, and less like a 
rogue robot assembled them.
And Apple has clearly seeded smart 
ideas into the mix. Fluffy Friends over the 
Years shows every dog and cat I’ve 
apparently ever photographed, using the 
scene analysis algorithms that also let you 
search by keywords like dog and cat.
The slideshows that you can run from 
Memories, which are automatically 
assembled from photos and videos, 
remain delightfully random. One created 
for “Glenn’s 32nd Birthday”—hey, macOS 
knows my birthday via Contacts, so it can 
figure this out—features loving pans across 
the back trunk and odometer of a car I 
once owned.
This feature remains far better in iOS, as 
it was in the previous versions of both 
operating systems, 
because iOS lets 
you play a 
slideshow as if it 
were a movie, and 
adjust settings for 
how long you want 
it to be and pick 
among music 
named by mood. In 
macOS, you press 
the Play Slideshow 
version, which 
brings up a set of 
prefab slideshow 
styles, most of which are not that great 
and are paired with annoying music.
LIVE PHOTOS GET A PURPOSE 
(AND EDITING GETS BETTER)
I confess I never much liked Live Photos, 
because there wasn’t much you could do 
with them, except play them back with the 
random before/after videos. (iOS 11 seems 
to have upped the frame rate on those, 
making them smoother.) Live Photos 
seemed like a clever idea in search of a 
reason. While Apple improved some 
aspects of Live Photos in iOS 10, such as 
adding image stabilization, they remained 
a Harry Potterish gimmick. Photos 3 finally 
lets you create new kinds of results—not 
just in iOS (where the feature is somewhat 
hidden), but in macOS as well.
Photos 3 shows every previous import operation, organized by date.

16   MACWORLD   DECEMBER 2017
MACUSER
APPLE PHOTOS 3
Click Edit with a Live Photo selected, 
and the Adjust tab of the editing window 
shows Live Photos-specific tools at the 
bottom. You can turn the feature off, as 
before, and mute its audio, but you can 
also select a new “key photo,” or the 
image displayed when the photo is at rest. 
And you can trim out unwanted parts of 
the clip.
But Apple added transformative 
features common in Instagram and other 
photo apps: Loop, which turns a subset of 
the live portion into a continuous cycle; 
and Bounce, loops in a sequence of 
forward to the end and then backward to 
the beginning. Unfortunately, you can’t 
select which portion gets these effects—it 
seems like an algorithm-driven choice. 
And you can’t (yet) convert your regular 
videos in full or as clips to apply these 
features to.
A final option, Long Exposure, has a lot 
of promise. With a still shot that has 
movement within the frame, you can get a 
lovely artistic image that captures the feel 
of movement. Looking through all my Live 
Photos, I didn’t find many that worked, but 
I will likely now enable Live Photos for 
specific shots that I want to extract as long 
exposures.
The whole editing interface offers 
significant UI improvements, too, grouping 
tasks into tabs at the top (Adjust, Filters, 
and Crop) and letting you turn on and off 
the depth effect in two-camera photos. A 
couple of more advanced features appear 
in the Adjust menu, too: curves, for a 
different and richer way to re-map the 
appearance of ranges of color in an image; 
and selective color, which you can use to 
swap out a specific color range in an 
image with an entirely different hue, 
saturation, and luminance.
A toolbar now appears in all Photos 
views, not just edited, that includes a 
rotation button (hold down Option to 
toggle it from counterclockwise to 
Live Photos can be transformed into loops, 
bounces, and long exposures.

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   17
clockwise) and Auto Enhance. Photos also 
now supports editing images in external 
photo-editing apps by selecting from an 
Edit With menu. When saved and closed 
from that external app, those edits become 
stored as a non-destructive layer in 
Photos, so you have the original and the 
revised version.
PEOPLE FINALLY SYNCS, AND 
IT’S BETTER, TOO
Apple promised a year ago, before the 
release of its revamped facial-identification 
feature, that “People are synced among 
devices where you’re signed in with the 
same Apple ID.” That line appeared in the 
iOS 10 manual, and the company had 
made other 
assurances. It 
never happened, 
and Apple never 
answered 
questions about it 
or explained itself.
My assumption 
was that before 
release, Apple 
found a flaw either 
in the way it 
merged dissimilar 
sets of people on 
different devices or 
in the privacy 
approach it took. 
You’ll note that Apple didn’t and still 
doesn’t sync this new algorithm-based 
People album to iCloud.com. That would 
put that kind of information in a place 
where it was at greater risk of being 
extracted or even subpoenaed.
This time around, Apple got whatever 
right they needed to. People’s overall 
design has a crisper, bolder look, so that 
names are more easily readable. The 
process of identifying and marking people 
seems better. And Apple says that it’s 
using technology from Memories to 
recognize people together, which provides 
more accurate ID and facial-expression 
selection—see my screen capture from 
People’s assemblage of photos of me!—
Selective color, now built into Photos, lets you replace color families 
within a photo without making other changes (left, original; right, 
modified to accentuate changes).

18   MACWORLD   DECEMBER 2017
MACUSER
APPLE PHOTOS 3
but also offers links to groups and pairs of 
people found in the same photo, a nice 
addition.
I found that my previous People album 
recognition carried through with the 
update, but some images were added that 
I’m sure I didn’t select. You can just right-
click on a photo and select John Doe Is 
Not In This Photo, and it’s removed.
Apple says that iCloud sync will 
reconcile different sets of photos for the 
same people on different devices.
THIRD-PARTY 
PROJECT 
EXTENSIONS
Apple now lets 
third parties build 
associated 
extensions that 
work with Photos. 
Previously, only 
photo filters could 
be added on. This 
new category 
works for 
creating photo 
books, ordering 
framed prints, 
creating 
slideshows, and 
building websites. 
Apple’s options 
for cards, 
calendars, books, 
slideshows, and prints remain.
These extensions come in the form of 
apps you purchase or obtain for free 
through the Mac App Store. You have to 
launch the app before using it, and then 
(in my testing at least) relaunch Photos for 
the apps to then appear as options in 
the Project menu or in the contextual 
menu’s Create submenu.
Apple sent a variety of samples of 
products made by these companies 
to Macworld.
The improved Memories feature now works within People, too, and you 
can see how good it is about finding smiles and other expressions.

quite lovely, although they may be a little 
too busy with patterns for some people.

> Shutterfly’s 10-by-10-inch hardcover

pages were too stiff, however, and turning 
them was like flipping through lightweight 
cardboard.

good dust jacket and binding, reasonable 
weight interior paper for opacity and page 
turning, and extremely fine photographic 
reproduction.
> An ifolor glass print, in which the 
image is printed in reverse on the back of 
a solid piece of glass—a technique popu-
larized in American by Fracture—had 
oversaturated images, leading to areas of 
flat color.
> Two examples of Whitewall’s glass 
prints were also included, which had 
excellent tonality without oversaturation. 
The photos sent were unfortunately too

APPLE PHOTOS 3
PHOTOS’ MISSING PIECES
Readers ask all the time about Photos 
library management, and the new release 
offers no help there. Many readers have 
multiple libraries they want to merge into a 
single Photos library, or they have a large 
library they want to split, in order to archive 
parts of it, or store it on an external drive. 
These fundamentally useful features that 
Apple would be best placed to help with 
don’t exist. (We recommend turning to 
PowerPhotos [go.macworld.com/rtpp], 
already updated for High Sierra [go.
macworld.com/fatc].)
Photos ability to search by date 
remains extremely poor, especially 
compared to Google Photos and other 
tools. There’s simply no good way to say, 
“Show me what happened on October 31, 
2010.” You can use the main Photos album 
and click Years in the new set of tab 
buttons at the top, scroll to 2010, guess 
about where October lies, click, and then 
scroll through Collections. Typing in the 
date as above into search offers no 
results. It can’t even do “October 31,” 
splitting it into “October” and “31” and only 
finding matches for both. The new version 
does seem to match address well: I typed 
in September 1, and saw a lot of photos 
taken in the month of September at street 
addresses that began with 1.
Likewise, searching by place is 
primitive. Enter “Camden, Maine” and 
Photos is stumped. Enter “Camden Maine” 
and it parses it to show “Camden, Maine/
City, State.” I can’t even begin to explain 
how Apple passed this through its testing 
teams. Search performance is far better 
than iPhoto and early Photos releases, but 
it remains as poor and wonky as all the 
Sierra versions of Photos.
MACHINE LEARNING AND 
iCLOUD PHOTO LIBRARY
If you’re using iCloud Photo Library and 
storing only optimized media on your Mac, 
you won’t be able to make full use of facial 
recognition, Memories, or scene-element 
identification for searching except for 
images downloaded and cached locally. 
You can also force downloads for 
processing by right-clicking a manually 
created album and choosing Download 
Originals To This Mac.
While this proviso was also true with 
the previous release of Photos, I think an 
increasing number of people relying on 
iCloud Photo Library might run into the 
problem because of increased media 
storage and the high expense of larger-
capacity SSDs. If you chose a 512GB SSD 
instead of a much-more expensive 1TB 
SSD or a 1TB or 2TB Fusion drive, it seems 
possible that you also used optimization to 
prevent filling that drive with media.
In my initial High Sierra testing, I’ve only 
updated my laptop, which lacks the storage 

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   21
to handle the full iCloud Photo Library. (My 
office iMac has a Fusion drive and the full 
files, but I’m holding back on my most critical 
machine as I do with all macOS system 
updates.) I downloaded albums to check 
that thumbnails weren’t being analyzed. 
iCloud Photo Library syncs metadata—
camera capture details, date, GPS
coordinations, keywords, and the like—so
other searches and organizational features
work as expected.
BOTTOM LINE 
Photos 3 for macOS is a significant 
improvement in interface, flow, and ease 
of use, but has no standout feature that 
will make you jump up and down in joy. 
Hopefully, the changes mean you won’t 
jump up and down in anger and 
frustration anymore. ■

Three MacBook mistakes:  
Will Apple correct course?
BY JASON SNELL
A
pple’s not a company that 
backtracks easily. It’s got a lot 
of pride and a reputation for 
moving forward. And yet every 
so often the company makes a decision 
that it thinks is right and is ultimately 
proven to be completely wrong.
In 2008, Apple removed FireWire 
from the MacBook (go.macworld.com/jrto), 
only to put it back in 2009 (go.macworld.

com/pibi). In 2009 the 
iPod Shuffle went 
buttonless (go.
macworld.com/ipsh), 
only to revert to its 
previous buttony design 
in 2010 (go.macworld.
com/ipbd). The third-
generation iPod, with its 
row of touch-sensitive 
controls, was a similar 
design cul-de-sac. And 
the most recent 
example is the Mac Pro, 
which Apple introduced 
to fanfare (go.macworld.com/fanf), but 
ultimately admitted was a mistake (go.
macworld.com/awam).
I’ve been thinking about all of these 
visible failures because I’m starting to 
imagine what Apple might do if it decides 
that some of the decisions it’s made the 
past few years regarding Mac laptops 
might have been…misguided.
ONE USB-C PORT ON THE 
MACBOOK
It’s been nearly three years since the new 
MacBook (go.macworld.com/3yrs) arrived 
bearing a single USB-C port for both 
charging and peripherals. Through two 
revision cycles, it has remained largely 
unchanged. USB-C hubs do exist, but the 
fact is that out of the box, you can’t power 
the MacBook and attach any USB devices. 
That’s less than ideal. So is a redesign in 
the works, and might Apple take that 
opportunity to add a second USB-C port?
It’s certainly possible. The original 
MacBook Air had a single USB port, but 
when the first major hardware revision of 
the Air arrived, it added a second port. A 
second port on the MacBook would allow 
just enough flexibility to eliminate the 
complication caused by the charging port 
also being the only peripheral port.
The MacBook only supports USB-C, 
while the USB-C ports on every other Mac 
also support Thunderbolt 3. Despite the 
confusing mess that is the USB-C standard 
(go.macworld.com/usbs), I don’t believe 
Apple is going to abandon it. A little 
consistency wouldn’t hurt, though, which is 
The MacBook has one USB-C port. Invest in a USB-C hub if you 
want to connect multiple devices.

24   MACWORLD   DECEMBER 2017
MACUSER
THREE MACBOOK MISTAKES
why I’m hoping that the next MacBook 
supports Thunderbolt 3, thereby extending 
that standard across the entire Mac line.
THE LOW-TRAVEL 
BUTTERFLY KEYBOARD
Introduced with that same MacBook, 
Apple’s shallow laptop keyboard has now 
spread to the MacBook Pro line. A lot of 
people, myself included, consider it a 
regression—the reduced key travel makes 
typing less pleasant and tactile. It’s also a 
little baffling that Apple chose to bring a 
keyboard designed to fit in the ultra-thin 
MacBook to MacBook Pro models that 
have much more room for key movement.
But the big issue with these keyboards 
is that they are apparently quite unreliable 
(go.macworld.com/quun) for many users, 
so much so that Apple posted a tech note 
(go.macworld.com/note) recommending 
that people use compressed air to blow 
out dust (go.macworld.com/dust) that might 
cause the keys to stick. Right now, most of 
the computers dealing with these 
problems are under warranty (go.
macworld.com/warr), but what happens 
when your four-year-old laptop’s key 
breaks and you have to have the entire 
top of your laptop replaced? An entire 
generation of Apple laptops may be 
saddled with fragile, unpleasant 
keyboards. And a laptop without a 
functional keyboard is basically useless.
The good news here is that Apple has 
other keyboard technology it’s built, most 
notably the Magic Keyboard (go.macworld.
com/magi), which was introduced the 
same year as the new MacBook keyboard 
and is much more pleasant to use. Apple 
could also just keep iterating 
on the MacBook keyboard, 
though I have a hard time 
seeing how small design 
changes will be able to 
address all the stuck keys 
and broken housings. It 
might be time for a strategic 
retreat back to keyboards 
that are easier to clean and 
service. A little extra key 
travel—especially on the 
thicker MacBook Pro 
models—would be nice, too.
The 2017 MacBook still uses the butterfly-switch keyboard 
introduced two years ago.

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   25
THE TOUCH BAR AND  
TOUCH ID
This is the big one. With the new MacBook 
Pro models of 2016, Apple introduced the 
Touch Bar and an accompanying Touch ID 
sensor. This year’s release of macOS High 
Sierra offered very little in the way of 
Touch Bar improvements, and I’ve yet to 
hear very many users rave about the 
Touch Bar. My early hopes that app 
developers would innovate with the Touch 
Bar to improve productivity have also 
been dashed, more or less. A year later, 
the Touch Bar seems to have no 
momentum and fails to provide a 
compelling reason for users to embrace it.
How long will Apple ride the Touch 
Bar? Shipping a new generation of 
MacBook Pros with physical keyboards 
would be a remarkable reversal of 
course for Apple, and an 
admission that this particular 
innovation was rejected by the 
market. It would also re-open the 
question about whether 
MacBooks should have 
touchscreens, as is common on 
Windows laptops and 
ChromeBooks.
And let’s not forget Touch ID. 
That feature is also only available 
on the MacBook Pro models, and 
with the arrival of the iPhone X with 
Face ID, it’s about to become 
previous-generation technology on iOS. 
Will Apple even attempt to bring Touch ID 
to more of the Mac, or will next-generation 
iMacs and MacBooks feature Face ID 
sensors instead? The iMac in particular is 
thick enough to easily incorporate Face ID 
sensors like those on the iPhone X, and its 
reliance on external keyboards would seem 
to preclude an easy addition of Touch ID. 
As always, there’s no way to tell today 
which current features are here for the 
long haul. We’ll only know for sure that 
they’re alive or dead based on if they 
appear in the next generation of Apple 
products. But it might be better for Apple 
and users alike if the next generation of 
Mac laptops discards the failed strategies 
of the recent past. If at first you don’t 
succeed, try, try, again. ■
We haven’t seen many innovative uses of the Touch 
Bar since its release.

ORGANIZER APP
Like Photoshop’s Bridge, 
the Elements Organizer 
helper app that ships 
with both Photoshop 
Elements and the 
Premiere Elements video 
editor, provides the 
bedrock for locating, 
selecting, and searching 
your photo collection for 
the best shots to edit or 
share, or to use in 
creating an artwork or 
building a slideshow. 
The Organizer gets a 
significant refresh in the 
2018 version.
This year’s Organizer debuts Auto Curate, 
an AI-derived feature that analyzes photos for 
quality parameters like composition, 
exposure, and faces, choosing just a small 
fraction among thousands of images. A slider 
lets you dictate how many photos you want to 
include in the results. The app’s Smart Tag 
feature, introduced last year, helps Auto 
Curate identify image content. I found the 
results hit or miss, as some overexposed and 
underexposed photos were included among 
the best results.
SLIDESHOW TOOL
Ease of use is the hallmark of the 
revamped Slideshow tool, which works in 
Auto Curate lets you use a slider to choose how many of your 
best shots you want to see.
concert with Auto Curate to automatically 
select the best shots, letting you choose 
from among several built-in animated 
themes and soundtracks. You can 
customize slideshows with your own 
soundtracks from iTunes, add captions to 
the images, rearrange slide order, or 
import additional images and videos. It 
takes just a few clicks and a few minutes 
to pump out a sharable slideshow.
AUTO SELECT
For amateurs and pros alike, selecting 
objects or people and separating out 
foregrounds from backgrounds, evokes 
major time-sucking anxiety. With the new 

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   29
Auto Select feature, all you have to 
do is draw a box or Ellipse around 
a subject, and the tool immediately 
recognizes the foreground and the 
background for a surprisingly 
accurate selection.
Of course, Auto Select may 
not get every last bit correct the 
first time, but you can add or 
subtract from the selection until 
you are satisfied with the result. 
From there, you can switch out

selected or use it for a different 
composition or slideshow.
OPEN CLOSED EYES
This AI-inspired fix can substitute open 
eyes for closed ones in a given portrait, 
letting you use eyes from a different shot 
of the same person. Subbing eyes can be 
tricky because lighting and skin color 
should be roughly similar for results to 
look really natural. Oddly, this tool also lets 
you substitute eyes from different 
people—but that is really creepy.
NEW GUIDED EDITS
Photoshop Elements 2018 features several 
new guided edits—Watercolor, Swap 
Backgrounds, Shape Overlay, and Double 
Exposure—which, aided by the 
new Auto Selection tool, add 
useful effects to the Elements 
arsenal of cool photo moves. 
On the whole, though, this new 
crop is less inspired and 
original than some in the past. 
That’s partly because any 
number of consumer programs, 
mobile apps, and online 
resources feature tools that let 
you do most of these things.
NO SUPPORT  
FOR HEIF
With iOS 11, owners of an 
iPhone 7 and later now save 
photos in HEIF (go.macworld.

File) format, rather than the 
traditional JPEG. This new 
image container offers higher 
quality and better compression 
for high resolution images or 
image sequences so you can

shoot without maxing out your device
storage. The new macOS High Sierra
works with this format in Apple Photos and
other native apps.
Photoshop Elements 2018 does
not support HEIF as yet, and the
company advises iPhone shooters to
continue shooting traditional
JPEGs by setting Camera
app preferences to Most
Compatible rather than
High Efficiency.
BOTTOM LINE
Photoshop Elements 2018
builds on a solid foundation of
consumer photo editing that
lets anyone achieve advanced
photographic special effects
without being a photo jockey,
and its increasingly integrated
use of AI and machine learning are time-
savers for busy households that want to 
quickly share images and slideshows.
The 2018 version also augments 
Elements’ established and growing 
complement of guided edits to help 
families create a memorable catalog of 
their lives. I have no specific complaints 
about how these new guided edits worked, 
but I found this year’s admittedly useful 
entries more utilitarian and somewhat less 
imaginative and inspiring than in the past. 
Some minor stability problems arose while 
testing the Organizer with the new MacOS 
High Sierra, but the intermittent freezing 
and crashing seemed to dissipate after 
repeated use.
If you were satisfied with last year’s 
version of Photoshop Elements, and have 
not been driven half-mad by family 
members who can’t keep their 
eyes open long enough to 
beat the shutter, you might be 
tempted to skip this version. 
However, despite some initial 
flaws in the Auto Curate 
feature, this is a potentially vast 
time-saver for those with 
thousands of images, and its 
assistance in creating quick, 
sharable slideshows is 
definitely worth a second look, 
while Auto Select is worth the 
price of admission. ■

previous version number was 15.

Adobe’s Organizer 
helper app, which ships 
alongside both Photoshop 
Elements and Premiere 
Elements, offers an 
updated, wall-to-wall view 
of your photographic 
assets in much the same 
style as photo apps from 
Apple, Google, and Flickr. 
(For a detailed discussion 
of specific Organizer 
updates, see our review 
of Photoshop Elements 
2018 on page 27.)
Premiere Elements 
puts the Organizer’s Auto 
Curate—a headlining 
feature for the new 
Elements package—to 
good use with its new 
features, Candid Moments
and Smart Trim. The 
feature also supports an 
overhaul of the Slideshow
tool, which turns out a 
template-driven animated 
visual within minutes for 
sharing on social media.
CANDID MOMENTS
Sometimes you just want to showcase a
single frame from a video, but to do that
you must painstakingly scrub through a
movie to locate and select those frames. 
Or you can let Premiere Elements’ new 
Candid Moments tool do it for you. This

do visually: scrub 
through your footage 
for the best single 
shots. After you review 
and approve the app’s 
still choices—you can 
add to or subtract from 
the auto selections—
Premiere Elements 
places the images into 
a separate folder.
In analyzing why the 
AI engine chose the 
frames it did (interesting 
lights, objects in focus, and of course faces 
and groups of people), its selections made 
sense. Nevertheless, I found the initial 
results hit or miss, especially with only six 
frames chosen by default; you can use the 
slider to generate additional frames. While 
auto choices were sometimes less than 
satisfying, the app did much better with 
people than with animals. Bottom line: I 
look forward to continuing improvements 
in this useful feature.
SMART TRIM
Almost all videos have boring footage that 
adds nothing to the production or 
message except excessive length, but it’s 
a tough manual process to expurgate all 
dull instances throughout a clip. That’s 
where Premiere Elements’ new Smart Trim 
feature comes in, using intelligent analysis 
to scan content and determine what can 
be removed without compromising the 
overall contextual message.
You can assist by customizing the 
algorithm to look for people, action, or 
both, and extract the minimum or 
maximum amount from the final version. 
The feature maintains flexibility by letting 
you easily add footage back into the 
movie right on the timeline without a lot of 
tedious snipping and trimming. The 
program automatically assembles all the 
clips with transitions into a final product, for 
quick, no-fuss posting on social media.
The tool worked well with casual videos, 
especially those without a defined 
soundtrack, as opposed to voice narratives, 
demos, or musical performances where, 
despite the transitions, cuts sounded a lot 
less subtle.
Smart Trim worked well, especially on footage that doesn’t feature 
narrative or music.

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   35
GUIDED EDITS
A mainstay of Elements’ core functionality, 
Guided Edits are the app’s popular step-
by-step recipes for how to create specific 
special effects and actions with both 
photos and videos. Every upgrade hosts 
several, and I tried them on for size.
Animated Social Posts: 
This neat storytelling tool 
lets you apply customizable 
static or animated text 
effects to a short video to 
quickly create social media 
memes and messages. 
Quite a variety of templates 
are available in categories 
like Decorative, Geometric, 
Formal, and Fun. You just 
need to choose one, set 
the start and end points for 
the animation, and type in a 
stylized message. There’s 
no complexity to the 
process and the results can 
be stunning.
Freeze frames with motion 
titles: This guided edit lets 
you emphasize parts of 
your video by freezing a 
frame and then adding a 
motion title. You just have to 
specify which frame you 
want to use while the guide 
takes you through some easy steps.
Bounce-back effect: Many of us are 
familiar with animated effects that make 
the subjects loop their actions forward and 
backward—like with Instagram’s

REVIEW: ADOBE PREMIERE ELEMENTS 2018
Adobe has come up with a technique that 
does something similar with a few 
customizable steps to create a 
sharable short video.
Fix Action Cam Footage: This guide is 
designed to fix fisheye lens 
distortions from GoPro and 
similar cameras as well as 
trim and correct color. The 
edit sequence first trims the 
fat off your video to distill it 
down to the best footage. 
From there, you apply the 
Lens Distortion effect, 
adjusting the Curvature 
slider until the video looks 
in perspective. The last step 
is color correcting the entire 
clip, and you’re in business. 
Or you can just trim and 
color correct the video 
yourself and use the Lens 
Distortion effect on its own, 
as you could in the previous 
version.
While the edit worked to 
improve GoPro footage, it 
was a slow, processor-
intensive experience, often 
accompanied by fan action 
from my late 2013 MacBook 
Air. Performance was 
inconsistent: The slider 
acted intermittently cranky, balking with a 
beachball at being moved, though at other 
times it moved without incident, while the 
preview moved haltingly, playing catch-up 
with both slider adjustments and the 
timeline marker.
Bounce-Back: Time stretch, reverse, rinse, repeat. Watch Lila

While it’s not in the guided edit, Adobe 
recommends rendering the timeline just 
after Importing a video clip and also after 
completing the Action Cam Guided Edit for 
smoother previews. The Lens Distortion 
controls respect your last setting, and do 
not revert to zero with new clips.
The Fix Action Cam footage guided edit can nix lens distortion, but it is a painstaking process.

buttons at a time, which 
update as you switch between 
applications. Buttons respond 
instantly when tapped, and the Mac 
app uses a negligible amount of 
CPU; you’ll wind up with another 
icon in the menu bar, however. 
Buttons can be left blank for a more 
eye-pleasing layout, and each 
desktop app can use up to 256 
possible shortcuts spread 
across four panels.
As you start using Keymand with 
favorite Mac apps, expect to see a 
lot of blank panels. That’s because 
the app only includes panels for 13 
macOS apps: Finder, App Store, 
Calculator, Calendar, Contacts, Dictionary, 
Font Book, iTunes, Mail, Notes, Photos, 
Preview, and Safari.
Have trouble remembering Safari shortcuts? Keymand can 
turn them all into one-tap buttons instead.
Keymand comes with panels for 13 built-in macOS 
apps including Finder, but you’ll have to create 
others all on your own.

DESIGNING BUTTONS
For other applications, users must create
their own custom buttons on the iPad. Switch
to Settings view by tapping an icon in the
upper right corner, where you can assign
keyboard shortcut buttons on a
per-app basis, each with custom
names and colors. The process
is straightforward enough: Tap
and hold the current color to
save as a swatch, which can
then quickly be applied to any
other button.
While convenient for mobile
workflows, Keymand would
benefit from the ability to
assign buttons on the Mac side
as well. Settings are only saved
on the iPad, convenient for
those who move between 
multiple systems, but not very 
conducive to sharing shortcuts 
with co-workers or colleagues.
The inability to export 
shortcuts is a glaring limitation for 
an otherwise useful app. I’d love 
to see the developer provide an 
online community where users 
can share individual app settings 
with others, which would make it 
easier for novices to get started. 
(An SQLite database is accessible 
from the Keymand app in iTunes 
File Sharing, but there’s no way to 
save data for specific applications.)
For the time being, Keymand appeals 
mostly to power users willing to dedicate 
time to assigning shortcut buttons one at a 
time, or casual users content with the 
built-in Mac software 
commands and occasionally 
supplementing favorite apps.
BOTTOM LINE
As someone who spends 
weekdays parked at a desk, 
Keymand puts my iPad Pro to 
work as a Mac keyboard 
accessory. But the cumbersome 
and time-intensive assigning of 
shortcuts would be better 
performed on the computer 
instead of the tablet. ■

The coolest connected toys of 2015 are 
back for round two this fall. Sphero has 
just rolled out (go.macworld.com/roll)—
sorry—the similar BB-9E and the even 
grander R2-D2 (follow-ups to its delightful 
app-controlled BB-8 [go.macworld.com/

IMAGE: ANKI
edition of Anki Overdrive—this time with 
the blockbuster Fast & Furious film 
license attached. 
It’s such an obvious fit, pairing the 
explosive action of the smash movie series 
with Anki’s speedy connected cars, and 
the familiar rides from this year’s The Fate 
Anki Overdrive’s app-steered  
robot race cars get a Fast &

of the Furious fit in perfectly with 
Overdrive’s existing supercars. By and 
large, the addition of movie branding 
doesn’t result in massive changes to the 
two-year-old experience, but it brings a 
little more personality and pop to the 
still-fun experience.
OVERDRIVE, ALL OVER AGAIN
At its core, the Fast & Furious Edition (go.
macworld.com/fafu; $169.99 MSRP; same 
price on Amazon, go.macworld.com/over) 
is very similar to the original Anki 
Overdrive, and the starter kit provides 
much the same kind of core experience as 
before. It’s an all-in-one bundle that lets 
you build a number of different race 
tracks, race and battle with friends or 
against computer-
controlled opponents, 
and use your iPhone, 
iPad, Android device, or 
Amazon tablet to control 
the action. And all of this 
stuff is compatible with 
all of the old track and 
cars, too.
Inside the bundle, 
you’ll find 10 pieces of 
track (four straight pieces 
and six curves) and two 
cars, as well as a 
charging station and a 
sticky-surface tire cleaner 
to help the little vehicles maintain traction 
and stay on track. And there’s something 
else to help with that: snap-on guardrails for 
the outside edge of the curved pieces. That 
was one of my biggest gripes from the 
previous version, as Anki previously only 
sold them separately.
Getting set up is a breeze: the ultra-thin 
plastic track pieces snap together 
effortlessly with a magnetic click, and you 
can build eight different designs from the 
segments found within. It even has a 
couple of risers so you can have a chunk 
of the course loop over another part. 
Once your course is constructed and the 
cars are charged up—that takes less than 
10 minutes, giving the cars about 20 
minutes of drive time—you’ll turn to the 
It takes mere moments to set up a quick track like this.

ANKI’S OVERDRIVE APP
app for the rest.
From the app, you’ll 
choose what kind of event to 
play, whether you’re 
completing missions in the 
Campaign or just facing off 
against local friends and 
family members with their 
own devices. And then you’ll 
use your iPhone or iPad to 
drive your car: the Anki 
vehicles are semi-
automated, so they’ll lightly 
accelerate and take turns on 
their own, but you can tilt 
your phone or tablet to shift 
lanes, speed up and brake as desired, 
and even fire off virtual weapons to slow 
down or spin out foes.
It’s very much like Super Mario Kart, 
albeit with real toys firing off and reacting to 
unseen digital attacks (the visual explosion 
seen in the opening image isn’t real). Some 
events make racing the top priority, while 
others are focused on who can land a 
certain number of attacks first—there’s 
some variety in the mix.
SOME FAST PERKS
What does the Fast & Furious franchise 
bring to the table? Well, the cars are the 
most obvious addition: Dominic Toretto’s 
Ice Charger and Luke Hobbs’ International 
MXT are pretty similar to the rides seen in 
The Fate of the Furious, albeit with a more 
of a cartoonish touch to match Anki’s 
otherwise bespoke toy vehicles. It 
would’ve been great to see some of the 
other flashy rides from earlier films, 
especially from back when the series still 
focused on brightly colored tuner cars, but 
these will do the trick for now.
All of the track pieces have a Fast & 
Furious logo along the edge, but one 
straight piece has something more: a 
special “Power Zone” area. If you drive 
over that first while other cars are nearby, 
you’ll “hack” them—which means they’ll 
slow down significantly, giving you a 
chance to speed ahead. Likewise, the 
other cars can do the same to you, even if 
they’re computer-controlled, so it adds a

Anki’s own creations.

new strategic element to the experience. 
You might have a reason to hit the brakes 
and stay back for a second, lest a rival 
driver force you into it instead.
Furthermore, the new Anki Overdrive: 
Fast & Furious Edition app (go.macworld.
com/ffea) is fully movie-themed, with 
hand-drawn renditions of familiar 
characters like Dom, Letty, and Tej, all with 
voice clips that either come from the real 
actors or very convincing sound-alikes. 
You’ll face them alongside other generic 
opponents in the Campaign mode, which 
finds you racing or battling it out with 
weapons as you progressively unlock new 
missions and in-app car upgrades alike.
And if you have one of Anki’s larger 
Supertruck vehicles (go.macworld.com/
vehi; $59.99 a piece; same price on 
Amazon, go.macworld.com/anki), the 
Takeover play mode is a pretty perfect fit 
for the movie franchise: it finds you 
battling other cars to try and take control 
of the semi truck and win the match. I 
didn’t have a Supertruck to try it out, 
unfortunately, but it might be worth the 
extra cash to add one if you and your 
family become deeply invested in Anki 
Overdrive—and/or want to reenact some 
movie scenes in your living room.
FURIOUS OR FUN?
Deeply invested is a key phrase here, 
because like the main set, Anki Overdrive: 
You might recognize these people.

ANKI’S OVERDRIVE APP
Fast & Furious Edition 
can be extensively 
expanded with 
additional track 
pieces, extra cars and 
trucks, and even 
special stunt pieces. 
But it’s all pretty 
pricey: two extra 
straight or curved 
pieces will cost you 
$20 per pack, while 
the plus-sign-shaped 
Collision Kit piece is 
$30 on its own. Anki 
also has enormous 
(go.macworld.com/
enor) add-on bundles 
ranging up to $380, and that doesn’t 
include a starter kit.
Adding more track opens up a lot more 
possibilities for course designs, and lets 
you create sprawling, inventive playgrounds 
for your cars to zip around—but as I 
discovered the last time around, the cars 
seem less able to stay on the track as it 
encompasses more and more pieces. The 
Launch Kit (go.macworld.com/laki; $30) in 
particular, in which the cars attempt to vault 
over a fairly small gap, is the worst addition 
of all. I couldn’t get the Fast & Furious cars 
to do anything but fall over the edge and try 
to drive under the other piece of track. 
More isn’t necessarily better with Anki 
Overdrive, as appealing as that might 
sound.
Even if you stick with the starter kit, 
there are still recurring annoyances. Cars 
that find their way off-track—even with the 
new guardrails—rarely find their way back, 
and they can’t do anything if they’re stuck 
up against a rail, spinning their wheels 
endlessly while on an orange magnetic

connector, or manage to flip upside down. 
You’ll still spend a little too much time 
babysitting the cars, which can be 
squirrelly at times and often get spun 
around and start driving the wrong way. 
They’ll eventually auto-correct and turn 
around, but you’ll lose some progress in 
the race. All told, these annoyances pile 
up as I’m frequently forced to get up and 
reposition cars to keep the race going. On 
the other hand, my four-year-old son—who 
first loved Anki Overdrive when he was 
two, and still calls them only by the name 
“car mats”—thinks it’s hilarious. So your 
mileage may vary. 
IS IT WORTH IT?
Overall, luckily, the concept of Anki 
Overdrive is just far too cool to be ruined 
by those little, albeit recurring hitches. It’s 
slot cars for a new generation, with little 
battery-powered sports cars that zip and 
zoom at your command, using your 
smartphone and an extendable track that 
you can customize to your heart’s delight. 
Sure, the add-on elements are costly and 
inconsistent, but you don’t need them. 
Even at $20 more than last time, the $170 
starter kit still feels well-priced for how 
much you get, and for how extensive the 
app experience is.
The Fast & Furious contributions aren’t 
dramatic; super-fans who have all eight 
films in their home collection don’t 
necessarily need to rush out and buy this 
solely for the license, but it’s really only a 
positive component. It adds a little more 
character and excitement to the fun, while 
the familiar cars and the new Power Zone 
are nice additions. I’d recommend this 
version over the vanilla Anki set, unless 
you specifically dislike the films.
And if you already have Anki Overdrive 
and you’re still actively enjoying it, or 
eager to give the experience a shot in the 
arm, then it might be worth adding the Fast 
& Furious Edition. It’ll be a pricey upgrade, 
essentially, but the extra track and cars 
offer a lot more options, the guardrails are 
a welcome bonus, and the new app 
experience serves up enough new 
challenges to potentially justify the 
investment.
The Fast & Furious Edition may not be 
a brand-new Anki Overdrive, but with the 
right license and a couple of tweaks, it 
feels fresh enough to warrant another look 
this holiday season. ■

10 of the best ARKit apps and

Apple’s augmented reality tech powers a new wave of impressive experiences.

A
ugmented reality apps have 
been around for some time 
now, but they’ve often been 
clunky or rudimentary. But 
Apple is pushing hard on an AR future with 
iOS 11, thanks to ARKit. The tech allows 
developers to create smarter, more 
responsive apps that tweak and enhance 
your real world via the lens of your iPhone 
or iPad screen.

ARKIT APPS AND GAMES
And creators were ready and waiting. 
When iOS 11 dropped in September, there 
were dozens of ARKit-ready apps 
available, some of which built upon past 
AR ideas and others that debuted new 
concepts. If you’re eager to see what’s 
possible, whether it’s with apps or games, 
we’ve picked out 10 of the most 
impressive ARKit experiences so far.
1. SKY GUIDE AR ($3)
Star-finding apps have been iOS highlights 
for years now, letting you use GPS to get 
the approximate location of stars and 
constellations in the night sky—but with 
augmented reality, now they can go a step 
further. We see that impressively with Sky 
Guide AR (go.macworld.com/skyg). You’ll 
still point your device toward the heavens, 
but now the info is overlaid atop your real 
world sights.
When aiming toward the unobstructed 
sky, you’ll see the overlay of stars and 
constellations right atop the sky, 
completing the illusion that you’re looking 
at the real thing…even if it’s daytime. Of 
course, it’s more handy at night, as it’ll let 
you pinpoint stars and sights with ease. Be 
sure to pack this tool for your next 
stargazing trip.
2. HOUSECRAFT (FREE)
Augmented reality can be extremely 
useful for envisioning how something 
would look in the real world, albeit without 
the hassle, expense, and commitment of 
the physical object. That’s definitely true 
with furniture, and Housecraft (go.

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   53
macworld.com/hous) is a surprisingly 
fun—yes, fun!—early ARKit app that lets 
you position and experiment with different 
pieces within your living space.
Unlike the IKEA Place app (go.
macworld.com/ikea), the furniture here is 
generic: this isn’t a shopping app, and it’s 
just meant to get your mind moving about 
what could work in your space. But it’s 
incredibly 
intuitive, the 
faux furniture 
looks pretty 
sharp (but also 
fairly natural 
against your 
own 
backdrop), 
and just for 
kicks, you can 
even toss in a 
tornado to 
kick things around 
when you’re done. 
Sure, why not?
3. DOMINO 
WORLD AR ($2)
Knocking down an 
elaborate trail of 
intricately-placed 
dominos is one of 
life’s great pleasures, 
but taking the time to 
set them all up—while carefully avoiding 
an early downfall—can be a stressful, tiring 
excursion. Luckily, this is one of those 
scenarios that augmented reality can 
solve, and Domino World lets (go.
macworld.com/domi) you build with ease 
before toppling your creation. 
It’s as simple as finding a flat surface, 
holding down a button, and then “drawing” 

54   MACWORLD   DECEMBER 2017
iOSCENTRAL
ARKIT APPS AND GAMES
trails of dominos by moving your device. 
You can even add in little stairs and toys 
for amusing twists. True, without the risk 
and effort of building the real thing, the 
reward isn’t quite as sweet…but it’s still 
pretty entertaining, all the same.
4. AR MEASUREKIT (FREE)
It’s time to throw out your tape measures, 
rulers, yard sticks, and levels. Why? 
Because now there’s an app for all of that. 
AR MeasureKit (go.macworld.com/arme) 
uses the power of ARKit to measure 
distance, letting you figure out the length 
or height of something via the camera. 
You’ll tap to set a starting point and then 
point where you’d like to stop, and just like 
that, you’ve got a measurement.
OK, so you might want to keep some of 
those traditional tools to confirm any 
ultra-precise distances (and make sure the 
app is working as it should), but for a 
ballpark measurement, AR MeasureKit 
seems to do the trick. The ruler tool is free, 
while tools to measure trajectory, height, 
and angles require a single $3 in-app 
purchase for the whole bundle of 
additions.
5. MONSTER PARK—
DINO WORLD ($3)
Have you seen the Apple demo that 
shows an enormous, realistic-looking 
Tyrannosaurus Rex dropped into the real 
world? Yeah, that’s Monster Park—Dino 
World (go.macworld.com/dino) in action, 
and indeed, it’s one of the 
more compelling visual 
experiences available using 
ARKit tech right now.
There’s not a lot to it, 
admittedly: you’ll start the 
scene, which puts the big 
T-Rex in front of a portal to a 
prehistoric world, plus 
there’s a Pteranodon flying 
about. You can prod the 
dinosaurs a bit and step 
through the portal into the 
other environment, all while 
freely looking at the beasts 
from all angles, but that’s 

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   55
about the extent of it. Luckily, it looks so 
good that Monster Park is perfect for 
taking fun gag photos and videos, or for 
letting kids explore a bit.
6. GIPHY WORLD (FREE)
Animated GIFs are all over the place, 
whether it’s on social media or in our 
messages—and now they can physically 
be all around you in Giphy World (go.
macworld.com/giph). Well, digitally 
physically, at least. Giphy World taps into 
the GIF repository’s vast libraries of 
moving images and lets you drop GIFs 
and themed GIF-scapes into the world 
around you using your device camera.
And they’ll stay in place as you move 
your iPhone or iPad around, letting you 
concoct elaborate and quite likely 
obnoxious GIF collages in the augmented 
version of your space. Look, there’s 
nothing critically important about Giphy 
World, and it’s clearly just meant for a 

56   MACWORLD   DECEMBER 2017
iOSCENTRAL
ARKIT APPS AND GAMES
laugh. But that’s fine: that’s what GIFs do 
best anyway.
7. STACK AR (FREE)
The standard version of Stack (go.
macworld.com/stak) is a one-tap game that 
you’ll be tempted to play over and over 
again, and the new Stack AR (go.
macworld.com/stvr) simply shifts the 
action to your coffee table, desk, or 
wherever else you have a flat surface. As 
before, the goal is to tap to place a 
moving block atop your ever-growing 
tower—and if you don’t time it perfectly, 
the overlapping edge gets cut off. 
Over time, that gives you less and 
less space to place the new block, and 
eventually it’ll be game over. It’s a simple, 
yet perfectly-executed concept. AR 
doesn’t do anything tremendously 
special for the experience, but it’s cool to 
have the game in your living space, 
almost like it’s a super-sized Jenga tower. 
The pop-up ads are aggressive, but $2 
within kills them forever.
8. AR RUNNER (FREE)
Using AR apps might be mostly centered 
on staring at your phone or tablet screen, 
but AR Runner (go.macworld.com/arru) is 
the rare exception—well, sort of. You’ll still 
keep your eyes on your screen, since 
that’s where the reality gets augmented, 
but this fitness experience is all about 
getting up and moving in a hurry.
AR Runner creates a little race path to 
run in your space, setting up virtual gates 
in the world for you to pass through, and 
then it challenges you to run the best time 
you can. Races comes in different sizes 
and shapes, plus you can compare times 
on the online leaderboards and even run 
local races with pals. It’s short, fast, active 
fun, and an inventive use of ARKit.

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   57
9. HUMAN ANATOMY ATLAS 
2018 ($1)
You might not want to see a real dead 
body up close, or handle real, excavated 
body parts—but with augmented reality, 
you can get all the knowledge without any 
of the mess or icky feelings. Human 
Anatomy Atlas 2018 (go.macworld.com/
huaa) lets you pull up an impressively 
realistic 3D model of a cadaver, eyeball, or 
other body part, drop it on a surface, and 
then examine it from all angles. 
That’s perfect for getting an inside look at 
a part of the human body and 
understanding its components 
and dimensions. The app itself 
is a bit confusing to navigate, 
however, and only some of 
the elements have AR 
experiences. That might throw 
you off at first, but once you’re 
staring into the abdomen of a 
fake-real corpse, surely all 
frustrations will be forgiven.
10. MY VERY HUNGRY 
CATERPILLAR AR ($3)
Eric Carle’s iconic storybook 
The Very Hungry Caterpillar 
has transcended generations, 
so both you and your young 
ones might get a real kick out 
of My Very Hungry Caterpillar 
AR (go.macworld.com/mvhc). 
It turns the classic storybook 
into a compact augmented reality 
playground, letting you feed the bug  
and have it play around with toys until  
it ultimately grows and transforms into  
a butterfly.
It’s not another telling of the classic 
story, unfortunately, and there isn’t a lot of 
depth to the experience. However, it looks 
really slick, especially if you play outside in 
the grass or another natural backdrop, and 
it’s extremely easy to understand and 
interact with. This one’s perfect for the little 
ones to play around with. ■

there is one important area where it’s 
firmly in the lead, and it has nothing to 
do with bezels or beats. It’s about 
intelligence.
At Apple’s recent iPhone X (go.

for the event, but machine learning was 
the strongest undercurrent, and the 
message Google sent was clear: Our AI 
is better than your AI.

smarts to make its 
products more 
responsive and 
adaptable to each user’s 
lifestyle.
It’s not about specs 
(although the Pixel 
phones [go.macworld.
com/pixe] have really good ones) or 
design (although the Google Home Max 
[go.macworld.com/goho] would look good 
in any room). In fact, none of Google’s 
new products are all that interesting on 
the surface, but what’s inside is leaps 
and bounds ahead of what Apple is 
doing with Siri and iPhone X. It’s about 
smarts, and Google has integrated 
Google Assistant and machine learning 
into every one of its devices in a, dare I 
say it, Apple-like way.
There’s the impulse-buy Google 
Home Mini (go.macworld.com/gomi) and 
the high-fidelity Max to put Assistant in 
every room of your house. Active Edge 
on the Pixel lets you squeeze the sides 
of your phone to launch Assistant. 
And the Assistant-powered Pixel Buds 
(go.macworld.com/pibu) feature a 
remarkable live translation feature. 
Google Home Mini will put Google Assistant in every room of 
your house.

GOOGLE ASSISTANT WINNING AI GAME
Google’s latest products are designed 
from the inside out to be smarter than 
they are pretty, a big bet that consumers 
are tired of good-looking gadgets that 
put form before function. And if it’s 
right, Apple could be playing catch-up 
for years to come. 
CONVERSATIONS, NOT 
COMMANDS
Apple’s first home AI speaker won’t hit 
shelves until December, but Google 
already has three of them. When it 
was announced in June, HomePod  
(go.macworld.com/hpod) appeared to 
have an advantage over Google Home 
and Amazon Echo with its high-fidelity, 
room-sensing smarts, but now Google 
Home Max has landed, and it might be 
even better.
Like HomePod, Google Home Max 
uses machine learning to analyze your 
space to deliver optimal sound, but 
Google’s method gets more granular and 
fine-tunes the sound based on the song 
you’re listening to as well as adjusting 
based on Max’s surroundings. But if 
they’re even when it comes to sound, 
the real difference is Google Assistant.
Apple has improved Siri’s speech 
patterns in iOS 11 (go.macworld.com/io11), 
but for the most part, its AI ambitions 
have been relatively conservative. 
Google Assistant isn’t just better at 
recognizing what you’re saying, it’s more 
contextual and conversational, which 
leads to an all-around better experience. 
And with the new Routines feature, you’ll 
be able to combine several tasks (like 
shutting the lights off, setting an alarm, 
and activating your security system) with 
a single phrase. It even recognizes your 
voice over the other people in your 
home. With Siri, commands are islands 
unto themselves, 
while Google 
Assistant is 
practically like 
talking to an actual 
person.

phones and Google Home, and now it’s 
everywhere: watches headphones, 
speakers, not to mention hundreds of 
millions of Android phones.
And now Google is branching out 
beyond simple voice commands. 
Exclusive to the Pixel phones (at least for 
now) is a new app called Google Lens 
(go.macworld.com/lens), and it has the 
potential to be just as instrumental to 
Google’s AI push, if not more so. A 
combination of augmented reality and 
artificial intelligence, Google Lens uses 
your phone’s camera to identify 
buildings or flowers, scan and store 
phone numbers, even input Wi-Fi 
passwords, all without needing to 
jump around to various apps.
This isn’t a fancy box for Google 
Assistant, it’s a whole new set of skills. 
Apple doesn’t have anything close to 
this type of functionality, and Google is 
set to begin shipping it in a few weeks. 
If it’s as fast and accurate as it is in 
Google’s demos, it will be nothing 
less than a game-charger for search  
(go.macworld.com/gcha).
BIG BEAUTIFUL BRAIN
Google is in a unique position to excel in 
the AI space. Where Apple needs to 
keep wowing us with drool-worthy 
hardware to get noticed, Google has 
taken a utilitarian approach to its design, 
banking on AI to drive the experience. 
The Pixel 2 isn’t as pretty as the iPhone 
X or even the iPhone 8 (go.macworld.
com/iph8) for that matter, but Google is 
selling brains before beauty.
In its first year, Google Assistant has 
advanced further than Siri has in the past 
seven. And it’s getting smarter every day. 
Not only is it basically on every phone that 
ships (including iPhones), but it’s in our 
homes, our cars, on our wrists, gathering 
information and learning how to better 
respond to our needs. And with Google 
Lens, there’s no telling how intelligent it will 
be this time next year. 
Google might never design a smartphone 
that’s as beautiful as the iPhone X. But one 
thing is for sure: It’s closer than Apple is to 
making one that’s smarter than a Pixel. ■
The Pixel 2 isn’t as pretty as iPhone X, but it’s 
way smarter.

Hate iTunes 12.7 and want to be 
able to install and manage iOS 
apps in iTunes? Install iTunes 12.6.3
BY ROMAN LOYOLA
I
Tune’s 12.7 removed the iOS app store 
(go.macworld.com/remov), which 
means you can’t buy or manage your 
iPhone and iPad apps when your 
devices are connected to your Mac. Some 
people don’t like it, and if you really don’t 
want to change your ways, there’s a 
workaround: You can install iTunes 12.6.3 
and get back access to the iOS app store.
There is a catch, though. Apple 
provides support only for the latest version 
of iTunes, which means that iTunes 12.6.3 

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   63
is not supported by the company and you 
can’t get technical support if you need it.
iTunes 12.6.3 was originally released to 
address the needs of businesses and 
enterprise customers that prefer the app 
management method built into iTunes 
prior to version 12.7.
You can learn more about iTunes 12.6.3 
by reading Apple’s knowledgebase article 
(go.macworld.com/base).
HOW TO INSTALL iTUNES 
12.6.3
If you’ve already installed iTunes 12.7, you 
can run the installer for version 12.6.3 and 
it will replace version 12.7. But there are a 
few additional steps you need to perform 
to get 12.6.3 to work.
If you are using iTunes 12.6.2, you don’t 
have to upgrade to 12.6.3. Click the 
following link to 
download iTunes 12.6.3 
for Mac: (go.macworld.
com/12.6).
Here are the 
instructions to installing 
iTunes 12.6.3 over 
iTunes 12.7:
> After downloading 
the installer, double-
click the disk image file 
called iTunes12.6.3.dmg. 
(It should be in your 
Downloads folder, or 
whatever folder you’ve designated as the 
download location.)
> In the window that opens, you can 
read the Read Before You Install iTunes 
document. Double-click on Install iTunes to 
run the installer.
> As you navigate through the installer, 
you’ll need to enter your user password 
to proceed. The installation takes a 
few minutes.

iOSCENTRAL
INSTALL iTUNES 12.6.3
> When the installer 
finishes, it will ask if you 
want to move it to the 
Trash. Click Move To Trash. 
After that, you’ll find iTunes 
12.6.3 in your Applications 
folder.
HOW TO FIX THE 
‘iTUNES LIBRARY.
ITL’ PROBLEM WITH 
iTUNES 12.6.3
If you had iTunes 12.7 and 
want to replace it with iTunes 12.6.3, there 
are a few more steps you need to do. You 
have to reassign the library that iTunes uses, 
because iTunes doesn’t like it when you are 
using a previous version to access a library 
created by the current version. You’ll see the 
message below. Click Quit. Do not click 
Download iTunes, because this will 
download iTunes 12.7. Here’s how to fix it:
> Go to your Applications folder and 
look for the iTunes icon. Hold down on the 
Option key while you double-click iTunes.
> You should see the message below. 
You can click Create Library, and this will 
make a brand-new library. If you click 
Choose Library, you might be able to 
access an older library, like the one you 
had before installing iTunes 12.7. You can 
click on Choose Library, and it should 
automatically take you to your iTunes 
folder; if not, you’ll find it in your Music 
folder. You may have a folder called 
Previous iTunes Libraries (see above). 
Open that folder, and then look for a 
recent .itl file. Select it and click Open. If 
it’s not the library you want, you can redo 
these steps and select a different .itl file.
> After you select your library file (or 
create a new one), 
iTunes will launch 
and you’ll find the 
iOS app store, as 
well as the sections 
to organize your 
iOS apps. ■

Lightning cables that snake through the

Height is also adjustable, allowing the

REVIEW: UDOQ
Udoq700 ($219) tops out at 27.56 inches, 
enough for all three iPad sizes with room 
to spare for two iPhones.)
The Udoq’s unique design allows 
owners to mix and match with 
Android devices with a quick 
cable swap. A small tool is 
included to facilitate this, or you 
can custom configure each dock 
when ordering. One thing not 
included is any kind of power 
adapter; the company sells a $35
six-port charger to address this 
limitation, as well as a Qi adapter 
($26) so iPhone 8 and iPhone X 
owners can join in the fun.
I understand the rationale—
most of us have plenty of spare 
chargers lying around, and this allows an 
individual cable to be plugged into a 
computer at the same time. But all these 
cables create a tangled mess behind the 
dock, especially when trying to 
determine which one goes 
where, since neither end is 
labeled. The Udoq also neglects 
iPads in landscape mode, since 
the angled back is too short to 
support tablets.
BOTTOM LINE
It’s one of the more versatile 
docking stations I’ve used, but 
the Udoq doesn’t go far enough

having too many cables. ■

A small processor is also embedded

REVIEW: MEEM
You’ll have to provide an AC power 
supply like the one shipped with your iOS 
device, but the Meem is otherwise ready 
to go. Plug it in and your device begins 
charging at 5V, then launches the free iOS 
app a few seconds later.
AUTOMATIC BACKUP
The Meem app backs up contacts, 
calendars, photos, videos, and documents 
stored on up to three different iOS 
devices. It can’t back up everything—
messages, ringtones, and other file types 
are off limits. The first time a device is 
connected you’ll create a four-digit PIN 
code used to access or restore data.
The app is laid out in two columns, with
the attached device on the left and backups
on the right. Meem delays automatic
backups 20 seconds, giving users
time to adjust settings by tapping 
a device icon to select which 
content types are backed up. 
Manual backup or restore can be 
done any time via drag and drop 
between columns, while archive 
mode is used to retain items from 
previous backups since deleted.
Meem is less ideal for iCloud 
Photo Library users with multiple 
devices, since photos and videos 
must be downloaded before they 
can be backed up. Even the 
128GB model isn’t spacious 
enough for this purpose, a
problem that could be alleviated
by using removable storage in
future models. There’s also a
desktop app offloading data to a
Mac, Windows, or Linux computer.
BOTTOM LINE
The Meem is a clever combination
of device backup and charging in
a single product, but the lack of
upgradeable storage is a limitation
for iCloud Photo Library users with
a lot of photos and videos. ■

REVIEW: WATERFIELD DESIGNS iPHONE CAMERA BAG
needed is a bag designed 
specifically for smartphone 
photography. With its iPhone 
Camera Bag (go.macworld.com/
cbag; $99 to $129 MSRP), 
Waterfield Designs has 
attempted to give us exactly that.
DESIGN
Waterfield Designs called it an 
iPhone Camera Bag but, provided 
your handset’s no larger than an 
iPhone 8 Plus, you’ll be able to 
jam most any smartphone or 
action cam into it.
The bag comes in two different 
finishes: ballistic nylon and a high quality 
grizzled leather. Available for $99 and 
$129, respectively, neither iteration of the 
bag comes cheap. But given how much 
replacing a single lost or damaged lens 
from a company like Olloclip (go.macworld.
com/ollo) or Moment (go.macworld.com/
mome) can set you back, it’s possible to 
look at the purchase price as more of an 
investment than a burden. Both versions of 
the bag are sized at 8 x 3 x 4 inches, and 
weigh less than 10 ounces.
The leather and ballistic face fabrics of 
the bag are both weather-resistant and the 
main compartment’s waterproof zipper 
helps to keep dust and liquids at bay.
The whole bag is swathed in a layer of 
dense foam, which is more than adequate 
for protecting any delicate hardware 
being carried inside of it from bangs, 
bumps, and other casual abuse. Further 
protection is found in the bag’s adjustable 
hook and loop dividers, which can divide 
and protect up to four lenses from 
banging up against each other while 
you’re on the go. The bag also has an 
internal zippered mesh pocket, perfect for 
stowing a few cables, lens filters, or a 
LensPen (go.macworld.com/lenp).
When it’s time to whip out a lens or 
other accessory, the bag opens up wide, 
making it easy to access everything 
inside. Unfortunately, the interior of the 
iPhone Camera Bag is black—I found 
that this made it difficult to quickly find 
what I was looking for, despite using its 
interior dividers to organize my gear 
The iPhone Camera Bag is just the right size for carrying 
a smartphone and a few photographic essentials.

ahead of time. Given that so much of 
good photography depends upon 
being able to quickly capture a 
moment using the right hardware, it’s 
a disappointing oversight.
CARRIAGE
The iPhone Camera Bag comes 
with a thin, adjustable nylon 
strap. Were this any other bag, I 
might take issue with this: Thin 
straps tend to make for an 
uncomfortable carry. But this isn’t 
a pack designed to carry your 
lunch, laptop, and jacket. The 
size and weight of the gear 
you’ll want to carry in the bag 
will be minimal, so the strap’s 
width can be, too.
Waterfield Designs equipped 
the strap with a pair of sturdy, 
spring loaded metal hooks that 
will ensure long service. 
Unfortunately, the clips attach to a 
pair of flimsy nylon loops on the 
side of the bag. I feel that these 
loops could easily succumb to 
wear over time. Replacing or 
repairing one could prove a 
major pain.
If you’re not into rocking it on a 
shoulder strap, it’s also possible to 
wear the bag on your belt, thanks 
to a pair of belt loops built into its 
backside. The loops could also be used to 
attach the camera bag to a backpack 
strap—a nice touch. I was also pleased by 
the fact that the bottom of the bag comes 
equipped with a number of elastic 
straps that can be used to 
securely lash a portable tripod or 
smartphone gimbal to.
BOTTOM LINE
Waterfield Designs’ iPhone 
Camera Case provides some 
much-needed protection to 
expensive smartphone 
photography accessories. But its 
steep price and a number of 
design flaws make it difficult to 
recommend it without 
reservations. ■
We’d be happier with the iPhone Camera Bag if these 
fabric loops were as tough as the hooks that attach to it.

 It only takes a moment                                to make a moment.

iPHONE 8 AND 8 PLUS REVIEW
iPhone 7 is officially out of beta, and it’s 
called the iPhone 8.
FAMILIAR DESIGN WITH A
GLASSY ADDITION
It’s true: At a glance, the iPhone 8 and 8 
Plus look almost identical to the iPhone 7 
and 7 Plus. They have practically the same 
dimensions (5.45 inches long by 2.65 
inches wide at 0.29 inch thick for the 
iPhone 8; 6.24 inches long by 3.07 inches 
wide at 0.30 inch thick for the iPhone 8 
Plus), same display size (4.7 inches 
diagonally for the iPhone 8; 5.5 inches for 
the iPhone 8 Plus), same button and port 
locations, and they both lack a headphone 
jack (very sorry to say). If you have a case 
for your iPhone 7, it will fit the iPhone 8 
like a glove. 
pple releases a new iPhone 
every September, and it’s a 
given that it will be the best 
iPhone ever. But what do you 
do when the company announces not 
one, not two, but THREE new iPhones? 
How do you rank them and decide which 
one is the actual best iPhone ever, 
especially when they don’t all go on 
sale at the same time? 
Because of this, the iPhone 8 and 8 
Plus are at an unfair disadvantage right out 
of the gate. The iPhone X (go.macworld.
com/iphx) was announced at the same 
time and is the clear frontrunner when it 
comes to innovation—it has an all-new 
design with an edge-to-edge, bezel-less 
OLED display and a new Face ID 
technology that lets you unlock your 
iPhone just by looking at it 
(literally). The iPhone 8 
maintains the same look 
and feel of the iPhone 6, 6s, 
and 7, with some changes 
and enhancements. 
However, pushing the 
iPhone X aside, the iPhone 
8 and 8 Plus make 
substantial improvements 
on last year’s iPhone 7 (go.
macworld.com/iph7), which 
Macworld’s Susie Ochs said 
felt “like a beta version of 
what’s to come.” Well, the 
The iPhone 8 (top) and the iPhone 8 Plus (bottom) look very 
similar to the iPhone 7, but with one key aesthetic difference. 

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   85
Color wise, you have three options: 
space grey with a black bezel, silver with a 
white bezel, or gold with a white bezel. 
Gone is the jet black matte finish, and 
gone is the lovely rose gold option, but 
Apple switched up its standard gold option 
to meet us somewhere in the middle. If 
you compare a gold iPhone 6/6s or 7 to a 
gold iPhone 8, you’ll notice that the iPhone 
8 has a copper-bronze tint to it, where the 
older models are closer to a champagne 
gold. I’m low-key obsessed with the new 
gold option—I think it’s the iPhone’s 
best color yet.
But if you look closer, you’ll notice one 
key design difference: It has a glass back, 
featuring a new glass formula that Corning 
made especially for Apple. Apple claims 
that it has a 50-percent deeper 
strengthening layer over 
Gorilla Glass. Because of 
the glass, the 8 models 
are slightly heavier than 
the 7 models—the iPhone 
8 is 5.22 ounces, 0.35 
ounces heavier than the 
iPhone 7; the iPhone 8 
Plus is 7.13 ounces, 0.5 
ounce heavier than the 
iPhone 7 Plus. I didn’t 
notice the extra heft at all 
when comparing the 
iPhone 8 to the iPhone 7, 
but it is definitely 
noticeable in the Plus version. However, 
the iPhone 8 Plus doesn’t feel like a heavy 
phone whatsoever.
This isn’t the first iPhone to feature a 
glass back: The iPhone 4 and 4s also had 
glass, but Apple ditched it with the iPhone 
5. I like the look of the glass a lot—it gives 
the iPhone a nice shine, and also gives it a 
bit of contrast from the main color. Take 
the new gold, for example. The glass back 
gives it a kind of cream-colored finish, and 
the gold really pops along the edges.
Yes, the glass does make the phone a 
bit more slippery compared to the 
aluminum finish of the iPhone 7. I haven’t 
had a problem with it slipping out of my 
hands or sliding off a table or anything 
unexpected, but it just feels more slippery, 
generally speaking. And it absolutely will

show fingerprints and smudges, even after 
a few minutes of casual use. If you’re 
worried about any of the above, then a 
case is the way to go. 
WIRELESS CHARGING
There’s a reason why Apple revived the 
glass back. The material is more conducive 
to wireless charging—which can’t travel 
through metals—and the iPhone 8 and 8 
Plus are Apple’s first phones that support 
the technology. You can top up your iPhone 
8’s battery with any wireless charging pad 
that uses the Qi standard—just place your 
iPhone on the pad, and it will begin to 
charge. It will make the same charging 
chime and flash the lightning bolt indicator, 
just as it does with a Lightning connector. 
Have a case on your 
phone? No problem: if 
it’s not metal, it should 
charge just fine through 
the case. I’ve tested 
out the iPhone 8’s 
charging capabilities 
with several different 
cases and haven’t 
had any problems.
I didn’t think this 
would be a feature that 
I cared much about, 
but it turns out, I do. I 
love that I can just set 
my iPhone down on 
the charging pad by my desk or on my 
nightstand without having to fiddle with a 
Lightning cable. It will be a zillion times 
better when Apple releases its AirPower 
charging pad (go.macworld.com/airp) in 
2018, where I should be able to charge my 
new Apple Watch Series 3, my iPhone 8 
Plus, and my AirPods all on the same pad. 
(Currently, the existing Qi pads can only 
charge one device at a time.) 
There are some downsides to wireless 
charging, however. To start, you can’t 
ignore the cost. Apple still provides a 
Lightning cable in the box when you buy 
your new iPhone 8 or 8 Plus, but if you 
picked up one of the charging pads that 
Apple sells in stores (either from Belkin 
[go.macworld.com/belk] or Mophie [go.

and is charging away. Right: But a slightly askew iPhone 8 cannot

that will set you back 
an additional $59.95. 
It’s common to have 
Lightning cables in 
every room in the 
house, but to do the 
same with charging 
pads could be a 
major investment.
Wireless charging 
doesn’t boast of any 
speed improvements, 
either. Apple states that wireless charging 
is about as fast as the included Lightning 
cable and 5W wall plug, and our testing 
lines up with that claim. There aren’t any 
wireless charging pads that support fast 
charging on the market yet, so if you need 
to reload your battery quickly, you’re 
better off using a USB-C–to–Lightning 
cable with a compatible power adapter.
Also, you can’t really use your iPhone 
while it’s charging, which is kind of 
annoying. And make sure you pay 
attention to how you place your iPhone 
down on the charging pad—if it doesn’t 
line up with the sensors properly, it won’t 
charge. During my first overnight charge, I 
had slightly missed the target (d’oh!) and 
the phone was dead before morning. 
Because of these reasons, I suggest 
starting with one pad and keeping it on 
your nightstand for overnight charging.
PERFORMANCE, SPEED, AND
SPECIAL FEATURES
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have a brand-
new chip: Apple’s A11 Bionic, which boasts 
a six-core CPU and 64-bit architecture. 
Apple claims that its two performance 
cores are 25 percent faster than the 
iPhone 7’s A10 Fusion chip, while it’s four 
efficiency cores are 70 percent faster. Our 
Geekbench speed tests support that claim.
Honestly, all I noticed was speed on 
both devices, especially when compared 
to my year-old iPhone 7 Plus, which has 
been sluggish for the last month or so. 
Apps launched right away, unlocking the 
phones with Touch ID was quicker than 
ever, Apple Pay was seamless, and video 
streaming via Apple Music, Netflix, and 
YouTube had little to no delay. Running 
powerful image editing apps like Adobe

large files? Also fast. Even installing new 
apps and running updates felt fast.
The speed is super noticeable when 
playing around with augmented reality 
apps. There are a small handful of AR 
offerings in the App Store—home 
decorating apps from Ikea (go.macworld.

app called Monster Park – Dino World (go.

the iPhone 8 handles all of these better 
than the iPhone 7. They are ridiculously fun 
to play around with, too: the apps prompt 
you to scan the floor around you, which 
takes just a few seconds, and then you’ll 
have dinosaurs stomping around your 
living room in no time. 
I also noticed slightly better battery 
performance, too. Both the iPhone 8 and 8 
Plus survived a heavy day of use while I 
was at Disneyland without needing a

photos and videos for my Instagram story,

and pull Fast Passes (which uses location 
data), streaming music, and more. A 
normal day of use still fares better than my 
iPhone 7 Plus, every single day that I’ve 
been testing these phones.
Officially, Apple says that battery life is 
about the same between the iPhone 7 and 
iPhone 8 (12 hours of Internet use on the 
iPhone 8, 13 hours on the iPhone 8 Plus), 
so your mileage will vary. On a normal use 
day, I typically have around 25 percent left 
on the iPhone 8 and 30 percent on the 
iPhone 8 Plus; my iPhone 7 Plus usually 
hovers somewhere around 15 percent. 
Chances are, you won’t notice much of a 
difference unless your older phone has 
experienced some performance issues (as 
mine has). 
As for call quality, every call I made on 
both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus sounded 
crystal clear, both when using Wi-Fi–based 
calling or FaceTime calls and while making 
calls over my cellular network (AT&T). I 
haven’t experienced any of the crackling 
issues that have plagued other iPhone 8 
owners. Luckily, Apple pushed out an iOS 
11 update (iOS 11.0.2 [go.macworld.
com/1os1]) that should fix the crackle 
problem, if you have it.
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus maintain the 
same level of water resistance as the 
iPhone 7, with an IP67 rating (you can 
submerge your iPhone for up to 30 minutes 
in a depth of 1.5 meters). I took them for a 
quick dunk in a swimming pool (they were 
fine!) and took them for a front-row ride on 
Splash Mountain (they were…shocked, but 
fine!). One caveat: You’ll have to dry off your 
Home button to use Touch ID, and you 
should make sure your camera lenses are 
dry, too. (Some of the 
iPhone 8 Plus’s 
post-Splash Mountain 
photos were slightly 
blurry, until I realized 
that the back-facing 
camera lens was  
still wet.)
Another welcome feature is the 
iPhone 8’s TrueTone Retina HD display, 
which automatically adjusts the white 
balance on the display to better match 
the ambient light around you. It’s really 
noticeable when you compare the 
iPhone 7 to the iPhone 8—the iPhone 8 
(and 8 Plus) look crisper and warmer. If 
you don’t have an older iPhone handy, 
you can toggle this setting off or on 
while setting up your new iPhone 8 or 
8 Plus to see the difference.
On a normal use day, I typically have around 25

THE CAMERA
Looking at specs alone, it 
doesn’t look like the iPhone 8 
or 8 Plus has improved their 
cameras much over the 
iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. But when 
using the cameras in the field, 
there are noticeable 
improvements.
The iPhone 8 has a 12 
megapixel back-facing 
camera, with f/1.8 aperture and 
digital zoom capabilities up to 
5x—just like the iPhone 7. It still 
has optical image stabilization, 
a quad-LED True Tone flash, 
noise reduction, auto HDR, 
and all of the other marquee 
iPhone 7 camera features. 
I’ve been using the Plus 
version of Apple’s phones 
since the launch of the iPhone 
6, and the Plus has always had 
a better camera over its baby 
brother. I was really impressed 
with what the iPhone 8 can do 
with its camera—all of the 
photos I took look great, with 
vibrant colors and sharp 
details that I wasn’t expecting to see.
The camera app hasn’t changed at all 
in iOS 11, so you can launch it and start 
taking great photos right away. Because of 
the speedy A11 Bionic chip, the camera 
was quick to focus and snap pics, even if I 
was in motion. 
The iPhone 8 Plus has more to offer. 
Both the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus 
cameras still rock dual 12-megapixel

the 8 Plus has better sharpness, vibrancy, and balance, both

setups, with a wide-angle lens at an 
aperture of f/1.8 with OIS, and telephoto 
lens at f/2.8. The 8 Plus has upgraded its 
Sony sensor to be more 
power efficient and to 
allow “deeper” pixels 
over the iPhone 7 Plus. 
Immediately, I noticed 
a better color balance on 
the iPhone 8 Plus over 
the iPhone 7 Plus. Colors 
were just a bit more 
vibrant, but in a natural 
way—nothing seemed 
heavily filtered or 
oversaturated.
My nighttime and 
dusk shots had also 
greatly improved, as the 
iPhone 8 Plus is better 
equipped to handle 
low-light photos.
You still can see some 
levels of graininess in 
low-light environments, 
especially if you’re using 
the zoom, but it offers 
better results than the 
iPhone 7 Plus. 
Mind you, I am not a 
professional photographer 
by any means. I don’t own 
a DSLR, and I’m mostly 
concerned with how good 
my photos look for Instagram-related 
purposes—but even I can clearly see the 
differences between my amateur shots with 
iPhone 7 Plus (left) vs. iPhone 8 Plus (right): The iPhone 8 plus

Light—performed ok, adding a nice level 
of backlighting and facial details that 
could be useful in certain settings. 
However, Stage Light and Stage Light 
Mono look flat-out silly most of the time. 
Use these sparingly.
Luckily, the default Portrait Mode 
setting—Natural Light—is a joy to work 
with. The bokeh effect is soft and 
subtle, and the clarity of most photo 
subjects is excellent.

focuses solely on the iPhone 8 Plus’s 
camera, so be sure to check that out for

BOTTOM LINE
It’s difficult to put a label on the iPhone 8 
and 8 Plus. It’s a definite update from 
2016’s iPhone 7—even though it looks 
almost exactly the same—but it’s different 
enough that it doesn’t deserve to be given 
an “S” naming scheme. To me, it feels 
more like an “iPhone 7 and three-
quarters”: Too different to be a 7, not quite 
different enough to be bumped into a new

category. And that’s why, understandably, 
some iPhone die-hards may be bored with 
the iPhone 8. It’s a big improvement, but 
not quite innovative enough to be 
exciting. All of the innovation hype lies 
with November’s release of the iPhone X. 
However, the iPhone X might
be too radical for many users. 
Remember when we all flipped 
out over the loss of the 
headphone jack on the iPhone 
7? For some, losing Touch ID and
relying on gestures for 
navigation instead of a Home 
button will be just as hard of an 
adjustment. The iPhone 8 might 
be playing it safe, but I don’t think that’s a 
bad thing.
So, who is the 8 and 8 Plus for? If you’re 
on the iPhone Upgrade Plan (or other 
similar plan with your carrier), you have no 
interest in the iPhone X, and the cost 
difference between your current 
phone and an 8 isn’t that much, 
this is a worthwhile upgrade. If 
you’re rocking an iPhone 6s or 
older, the improvements here will 
be noticeable, too. But if you’re 
on an iPhone 7 and still love it, 
you can probably stick with your 
current phone for one more year 
and be just fine. ■

design choice, but I 
wouldn’t be surprised to 
see similar flourishes on 
future models. The 
Apple Watch’s design is 
already iconic, and I 
don’t see a massive 
redesign in the cards for 
Series 4 or 5. Apple 
positions its watch as 
jewelry like a Rolex or 
Omega, so the familiarity of the design is 
important. The red dot is a perfect way to 
showcase newness, even status, without 
changing what makes the Apple Watch so 
recognizable.

dous speed boost.
Navigation and animations are much 
smoother now, but most importantly, apps 
open much quicker. The speed of third-
party apps was a pretty major pain point 
with previous generations of the Apple 
Watch (particularly the original model, 
which most people will be upgrading 
from), and the new internals make a huge 
difference. I didn’t experience any lag 
when launching stock apps, and third-party 
ones rarely showed the spinning loading 
ring while updating. Even raise-to-wake 
seems quicker (though the lack of an

That makes the Apple Watch Series 3

ALL DAY AND THEN SOME
Apple claims the same 18-hour battery life
with either the LTE or non-LTE Series 3
Apple Watches, but as with all battery
claims, that doesn’t tell the whole story.
Apple doesn’t like to give technical specs
for its batteries, but iFixit’s teardown found
a 279 mAh cell inside the 38mm LTE
model, a minuscule upgrade over the
Series 2’s 273mAh battery. iFixit didn’t
open a 42mm model, but presumably its
battery is also a little larger than the Series
2 model’s 334mAh one.
But while the Apple Watch’s battery is a
good deal smaller than most of its compet-
itors’, it pretty much blows them all away.
With a phone nearby most of the time, I
breezed through a full day and
most of a second. That includes
wearing it while I slept, making
calls, checking scores, respond-
ing to messages, getting direc-
tions—all of the usual things
you’d do while wearing it. While
the Series 3 might pale in
comparison to Fitbit Ionic’s four
to five day battery life, OG Apple
Watch upgraders will surely see
a nice boost in battery life.
Granted, those numbers
deteriorate pretty quickly when relying
exclusively on LTE. When I left my phone at
home and used my watch for everything—
including a lengthy stretch of listening to
music, a couple Apple Pay purchases,
driving directions, and liberal use of the Siri
face—I barely got through 8 hours. When I
made a straight hour of phone calls, my
battery dropped to 68 percent. An hour of
music mixed with messages and emails
cost a little more than 10 percent.
But that’s not a typical use case. When
jumping between phone and LTE connec-
tion as most people will do, I was easily able
to make it through a full day. With the excep-
tion of making calls and listening to music, I
measure my Apple Watch interactions in
seconds, not minutes, but even when using
it far more than I normally would (both
tethered and independently), I never needed
to resort to Power Reserve mode.
Even when playing music for long stretches, you’ll still get 
great battery life with Apple Watch Series 3.

measure elevation. Older watches still 
measure flights climbed, but it’s that 
much more accurate on the Apple Watch

Apple hasn’t actually updated the 
heart-rate sensor for its Series 3 watch, 
but it’s extracting a whole lot more out of 
it. Launch the Heart Rate app, and you’ll

current beats-per-minute reading as well 
as your resting rate and walking average. 
Even as a non-athlete, I found it useful, 
especially the feature that alerts you to 
any abnormalities (thankfully I didn’t get 
to test it, however).
But music is the Apple Watch Series 
3’s killer new fitness feature. All through-
out watchOS 4 there are little touches 
that make it easier to listen and control 
your music: You can swipe left in the 
Workout app to bring up music controls, 
a Now Playing box appears on the Siri 
watch face, and the music app will 
automatically sync playlists while 
charging. However, you still can’t play 
music through the Apple Watch’s 
speaker, and proper LTE streaming won’t 
arrive until the upcoming 4.1 update.
The new Heart Rate app 
isn’t just for athletes.

LTE BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER
All of these upgrades are nice, but the
Apple Watch Series 3 is all about one thing: 
its cellular connection. For the first time, an
Apple Watch can operate independently of
your phone, and it’s a liberating, transcen-
dent experience…most of the time.
I’ve used a variety of LTE watches from 
Samsung (go.macworld.com/sams), LG (go.
macworld.com/lg), and ZTE (go.macworld.
com/zte), and the Apple Watch Series 3 is
the first that delivers on its promise. Setup
with the eSim and my Verizon account was 
remarkably simple, taking less than a
minute, and the only setting to speak of is
an on/off toggle. LTE simply takes over
when your watch is out of range of your
phone. I was very aware of when it was
running at first, but after a couple days I 
stopped obsessively checking to see if my 
watch was connected.
It’s not perfect, however. I didn’t have 
anywhere near the constant problems with 
unauthenticated networks (go.macworld.
com/unt) that some early reviewers experi-
enced, but there were still instances where 
my watch showed a red “x” while roaming 
to indicate that it was disconnected from 
the cellular network. Resetting my phone’s 
network settings and deleting some old 
saved networks on my Mac helped 
immensely, but that’s not something you 
should have to do to ensure a stable 
connection. Apple issued the 4.0.1 update 
(go.macworld.com/tktk) while I was writing 
this review to correct it, but it didn’t fix 
The complication on 
Explorer would be 
great as an option on 
other watch faces.

some of my other occasional problems.
In poor coverage areas, I found that the 
watch routinely dropped its connection 
where my phone was able to hang on with 
a bar or two. If I was on a call when I left 
my house, it consistently dropped when 
switching from Wi-Fi to cellular. And once it 
required a hard reset to get LTE going on 
my watch again.
In strong coverage areas, however, my 
watch worked great. Overall my issues 
were infrequent and as expected for a 
first-gen product. I did want the ability to 
add a cellular complication to any watch 
face. The antenna isn’t nearly as strong as it 
is on the iPhone, and unless you’re using 
the Explorer face, you can’t quickly tell how 
strong your connection is without heading 
into the mini Control Center first. I’m hoping 
this is a new feature in watchOS 4.1, along 
with a fix for my Wi-Fi handoff issues.
But even with the above hiccups, LTE 
on Apple Watch Series 3 is game-changing. 
I routinely left my phone on the charger 
while leaving the house for quick errands or 
to pick up my son from school, and my 
watch dutifully kept me up-to-date with 
notifications. I never missed a message, 
call, score, or breaking news brief, and Siri’s 
improved responsiveness let me quickly 
send messages over LTE without needing 
to scribble letters on the screen. And at 
times, my watch actually refreshed faster 
than when it was tethered to my phone. 
When you walk away from your 
phone with an LTE Apple Watch, you 
don’t need to freak out anymore.

FEATURE
watchOS STILL A WORK IN
PROGRESS
Just because you can use the Apple Watch
without your phone doesn’t make it an
iPhone replacement. Even with watchOS 4,
many third-party apps still depend on the
phone for data retrieval, and things like
checking my Twitter timeline, controlling my
Hue lights, or peeking at my Ring video
doorbell feed just weren’t possible. Devel-
opers have slowly been moving away from
building Apple Watch apps—just last week
Twitter disappeared from the store, and I
had major issues with it even before that
happened—but I’m hopeful LTE compels
them to get back on board.
And here’s something that would help
spur interest: an on-watch App Store. It’s 
one of the best features of Android Wear 
2.0, and it would be awesome to quickly 
find and install a watch app while away from 
our phones. Also missing is a stock Notes 
app. While there are a few third-party 
options, I wanted a way to quickly ask Siri to 
take a note and have it sync back to my 
iPhone. As it stands, that can’t happen.
I love having a list view for apps—seri-
ously, I’m never using the honeycomb 
screen ever again—but the new Dock isn’t 
as great. It’s basically a task manager/app 
switcher, and I much preferred the original 
Glances or watchOS 3’s snapshots, which 
would let you get little bits of info without 
actually opening the app. With the new 
method, apps 
need to be 
launched before 
they’re updated, 
like the iPhone’s 
app switcher. 
Fast app switch-
ing isn’t nearly 
as useful on the 
watch as it is on 
the phone, and 
I’d like to see 
Apple revert to 
the old version 
in watch OS 5. 
Glanceability is 
important, and 
Even when playing music for long stretches, you’ll still get great battery life 
with the Apple Watch Series 3.

it’s not really there in watchOS 4.
My favorite new watch face on watch 
OS 4 was already the Siri one (sorry Buzz 
and Woody), but Apple Watch Series 3 
takes it to a new level. With LTE connectiv-
ity, the Siri face is even more useful when 
my phone’s not around, as it continuously 
shows a stream of news, weather, stocks, 
and photos. LTE and the Siri face didn’t 
seem to have a noticeable impact on 
battery life. Third-party app support would 
make the Siri face that much better, but 
something tells me we’ll have to wait a 
while before that arrives.
But mostly watchOS is merely a step, 
not a leap, forward. There are still occa-
sional bugs. For example, I couldn’t take a 
screenshot despite toggling, restarting, 
and re-pairing, and the side button is less 
useful than ever. But you’re still not going 
to find a better wearable platform.
SHOULD YOU BUY AN APPLE 
WATCH SERIES 3?
For my purposes, the Apple Watch Series 
3 is a software update and a couple apps 
away from being my dream device. But 
even in its current form, it’s miles ahead of 
its closest competitor when it comes to 
functionality and parsecs ahead with 
design. There’s a reason Apple hasn’t 
visually changed its watch in three genera-
tions: It’s nearly perfect.

like comparing a Casio watch to a Tag Heuer 
or a Rolex. You can save a few bucks by 
getting a cheaper Android Wear or Fitbit 
watch, but you’ll definitely get 
your money’s worth by choosing 
an Apple Watch Series 3. At 
$329/$359 for the GPS model 
or $399/$429 for LTE, it’s hardly 
a luxury item anymore. Granted, 
you can spend $1,200 on a 
ceramic Edition or Hermès 
double tour, but the affordable 
entry-level sport models look 
and act just as good.
Apple is the only company 
committed to developing a solid 
wearable platform. Fitbit’s Ionic 
is initially underwhelming as a smartwatch, 
Samsung’s Tizen OS is still struggling with 
security and adoption, and we’ve yet to see 
a meaningful Android Wear 2.0 
watch after six months of public 
availability. LTE has its issues—
most of which will be snuffed out 
in the first software update—but 
Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE is 
the first cellular smartwatch to 
get it right. Apple Watch Series 3 
might not be an iPhone replace-
ment, but it’s the closest thing to 
an all-day, independent wear-

KRACK Wi-Fi attack threatens all
networks: How to stay safe and
what you need to know
BY BRAD CHACOS AND MICHAEL SIMON
WORKINGMAC
Tips, Tricks, and Tools to Make You 
and Your Mac More Productive
A
devastating flaw in Wi-Fi’s WPA 
(go.macworld.com/wfpa) 
security protocol makes it 
possible for attackers to 
eavesdrop on your data when you 
connect to Wi-Fi. Dubbed KRACK, the 
issue affects the Wi-Fi protocol itself—not 
specific products or implementations—and 
“works against all modern protected Wi-Fi 
networks,” according to Mathy Vanhoef 
(go.macworld.com/math), the researcher 
that discovered it. That means that if your 
device uses Wi-Fi, KRACK likely impacts it. 
Fortunately, major tech companies are

KRACK WI-FI ATTACK
moving quickly to patch the issue.
Read on for what you need to know 
about the KRACK Wi-Fi vulnerability, from 
how it works to how to best protect 
yourself against it. We’ll repeatedly 
update this article as more information 
becomes available.
HOW DOES KRACK BREAK 
WI-FI SECURITY?
KRACK (short for, uh, Key Reinstallation 
AttaCK) targets the third step in a four-way 
authentication “handshake” performed 
when your Wi-Fi client device attempts to 
connect to a protected Wi-Fi network. The 
encryption key can be resent multiple 
times during step three, and if attackers 
collect and replay those retransmissions in 
particular ways, Wi-Fi security encryption 
can be broken.
That’s the CliffsNotes version. For a 
more technically detailed explanation, 
check out Mathy Vanhoef’s KRACK attacks 
website (go.macworld.com/kraw). 
WHAT DEVICES ARE AFFECTED 
BY KRACK?
If your device uses Wi-Fi, it’s likely 
vulnerable to the KRACK Wi-Fi security 
flaw to some degree, though some get it 
worse than others. We go into greater 
detail about how particular devices are 
affected by KRACK in a dedicated section 
further below. 

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   111
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WI-FI 
SECURITY IS BROKEN?
For starters, the attacker can eavesdrop 
on all traffic you send over the network. 
“This can be abused to steal sensitive 
information such as credit card numbers, 
passwords, chat messages, emails, 
photos, and so on,” Vanhoef explains. 
For a deeper look at the potential 
impact, check out PCWorld’s article on 
what an eavesdropper sees when you 
use an unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot  
(go.macworld.com/eave). It’s a few 
years old, but still illuminating.
The United States Computer 
Emergency Readiness Team also issued 
this warning as part of its KRACK security 
advisory, per Ars Technica (go.macworld.
com/arte): “The impact of exploiting these 
vulnerabilities includes decryption, packet 
replay, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP 
content injection, and others.” HTTP 
content injection means the attacker could 
sneak code into the websites you’re 
looking at to infect your PC with 
ransomware or malware.
So yeah, it’s bad. Keep your security 
shields active, just in case. PCWorld’s 
guide to the best antivirus software (go.
macworld.com/beso) can help you select a 
reliable solution if needed.
IS WI-FI SECURITY BEING 
BROKEN IN THE WILD?
“We are not in a position to determine if 
this vulnerability has been (or is being) 
actively exploited in the wild,” Vanhoef 
says. US-CERT’s advisory didn’t include 
any information about whether KRACK is 
being exploited in the wild, either.
Now for some somewhat 
settling news: Iron Group CTO 
Alex Hudson says (go.
macworld.com/alex) an attacker 
needs to be in range of your 
Wi-Fi network to carry out any 
nefarious plans with KRACK. 
“You’re not suddenly vulnerable 
to everyone on the internet,” he says.
HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF 
FROM KRACK’S WI-FI FLAW
Keep your devices up to date! Vanhoef 
says “implementations can be patched in a 
backwards-compatible manner.” That 
means that your device can download an 
update that protects against KRACK and 
still communicate with unpatched 
hardware while being protected from the 
security flaw. Given the potential reach of 
“The impact of exploiting these 
vulnerabilities includes decryption, 
packet replay, TCP connection hijacking, 
HTTP content injection, and others.”

KRACK WI-FI ATTACK
KRACK, patches are 
coming quickly from 
many major hardware 
and operating system 
vendors. Up-to-date 
Windows PCs, for 
example, are already 
protected. 
Until those updates 
appear for other 
devices, consumers 
can still take steps to 
safeguard against 
KRACK. The easiest 
thing would be to simply use a wired 
ethernet connection, or stick to your 
cellular connection on a phone. That’s not 
always possible though.  
If you need to use a public Wi-Fi 
hotspot—even one that’s password 
protected—stick to websites that use 
HTTPS encryption. Secure websites are 
still secure even with Wi-Fi security 
broken. The URLs of encrypted websites 
will start with “HTTPS,” while unsecured 
websites are prefaced by “HTTP.” The 
Electronic Frontier Foundation’s superb 
HTTPS Everywhere browser plug-in  
(go.macworld.com/htev) can force all sites 
that offer HTTPS encryption to use that 
protection. Alternatively, you can hop on a 
virtual private network (VPN) to hide all of 
your network traffic. Don’t trust random 
free VPNs, though—they could be after 
your data as well. PCWorld’s guide to the 
best VPN services (go.macworld.com/
bvpn) can help you pick out a trustworthy 
provider. And again, keep your antivirus 
software (go.macworld.com/beso) up to 
date to protect against potential code 
injected malware.
Going forward, the Wi-Fi Alliance  
(go.macworld.com/alli) will require testing 
for the KRACK WPA2 vulnerability in its 
global certification lab network, so new 
devices will be protected out of the box.
DEVICE AND ROUTER WI-FI 
SECURITY FAQ
Is my phone at risk?
KRACK is a different sort of attack than 
previous exploits, in that it doesn’t go after 
devices, it goes after the information you 
use them to send. So while the data stored 

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   113
on your phone is safe from hacking, 
whenever you use it to send a credit card 
number, password, email, or message over 
Wi-Fi, that data could be stolen.
So my router is vulnerable?
That’s closer, but still not totally accurate. 
It’s not the device that’s at risk, it’s the 
information, so the sites you visit that 
aren’t HTTPS are most vulnerable. 
Oh, so I should change my Wi-Fi 
password then?
Well, you can, but it’s not going to stop the 
likelihood of attack. The exploit targets 
information that should have been 
encrypted by your router, so the attacker 
doesn’t need to crack your password to 
implement it. In fact, it has no bearing on 
the attack whatsoever. 
So all devices are at risk?
Now you’re getting it. However, while any 
device that sends and receives data over 
Wi-Fi is at risk, the researchers who 
uncovered the attack said Android devices 
were more at risk than other mobile phones.
Great, I have an Android phone. But I’m 
running Nougat so I’m safe, right?
Unfortunately, no. Newer phones running 
Android 6.0 or later are actually more at 
risk since there is an existing vulnerability 
in the code that compounds the issue 
and makes it easier to “intercept and 
manipulate traffic.”
Google expects to have a security 
patch ready for November 6, which should 
promptly roll out to Pixel and Nexus 
devices. But it could take weeks or even 
months for Android hardware makers and 
cellular providers to validate and deploy 
the patch to other phones and tablets. 
Many devices, especially older ones, may 
never receive the update.
So are my iPhone and Mac safe?
Safer than Android, but still not entirely safe. 
Apple said in a statement that all current 
iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS betas 
include a fix for KRACK. It will be rolling out 
to all devices within a few weeks.
What about Windows PCs?
They’re safe if you stayed updated. 
Microsoft released a Windows patch (go.
macworld.com/wpat) to protect against 
KRACK on October 10, before the 
vulnerability was made public.
I run Linux. I’m impenetrable to  
attack, right?
Not quite. Researchers actually found that 
Linux machines were the most vulnerable 
desktop devices, with a similar bug to the 
one found in the Android code. Now for 
the good news: An upstream Linux patch 
(go.macworld.com/upst) is already 

114   MACWORLD   DECEMBER 2017
WORKINGMAC
KRACK WI-FI ATTACK
available, as are KRACK-
blocking updates for Ubuntu 
(go.macworld.com/ubun), 
Gentoo (go.macworld.com/
gent), Arch (go.macworld.com/
arch), and Debian (go.
macworld.com/debi) 
distributions. A patch is also 
available for OpenBSD  
(go.macworld.com/obsd).
I have automatic updates 
turned on. How do I know if 
my mobile device has been 
updated?
The quickest way is to check the system’s 
software updates tab in your Settings app 
to see when the most recent version has 
been updated. More helpfully, Owen 
Williams is keeping a running list of 
companies that have distributed patches 
on his Recharged blog (go.macworld.com/
rech). It’s a stellar resource.
What about my router?
First, you should check to see if your 
router has any pending firmware 
updates. Most people aren’t as vigilant 
in updating their routers as they are with 
their phones or PCs, so log into your 
admin page and install any waiting 
updates. If there aren’t any, it’s a good 
habit to check back every day, since 
companies will be rolling out patches 
over the coming weeks, with some 
already being implemented.
Netgear (go.macworld.com/gear), Intel 
(go.macworld.com/intl), Eero (go.macworld.
com/ero1), and business-focused 
networking providers already have KRACK 
router patches available. Eero’s is rolling 
out automatically as an over-the-air 
update. The popular DD-WRT open router 
firmware has designed a patch (go.
macworld.com/trac), but it isn’t available to 
download yet. Expect it soon.
So should I turn off Wi-Fi? 
That’s probably not a viable option for 
most people, but if you’re completely 
panic-stricken, then the only way to be 
completely safe is to avoid using Wi-Fi 
until you know your router has been 
patched. ■

REVIEW: PARALLELS DESKTOP 13
TOUCH BAR WIZARD
If you own a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, 
Parallels Desktop 13 for Mac (go.macworld.
com/pade) is a must-have upgrade. That’s 
because key features of Windows 10 will 
now appear on the Touch Bar while a VM 
is running, a feature that works straight 
away for the Start Menu, Cortana, Desktop, 
File Explorer, and popular web browsers 
like Edge, Chrome, and Firefox.
Microsoft Office 2016 applications are 
also imbued with Touch Bar capabilities, 
offering multiple command sets depending 
upon what you’re doing in the app. But 
what about the thousands of other 
available Windows 10 apps? Most of them 
are supported too, but some assembly is 
required.
Located under the View menu, Touch 
Bar Wizard allows Parallels users to 
customize which Windows commands are 
displayed for the current application, just 
like they already do on macOS—in fact, 
Parallels uses the exact same pop-up 
configuration panel. It does take a little 
time to set up and some buttons won’t 
work in certain Windows apps, but this is 
otherwise a slick addition for MacBook Pro 
owners.
PIP YOUR VMS
Parallels Desktop 13 does an admirable job 
of adopting PC-only features on the Mac. 
This time around it’s People Bar, a new 
feature in the Windows 10 Fall Creators 
Update which consolidates favorite 
contact information into the Taskbar. PD13 
cleverly delivers these favorites to the 
macOS Dock instead, but 
is currently limited to the 
stock Windows Mail app. 
(The latest Windows 
Insider build is also 
required for now.)
PD13 also taps into the 
picture-in-picture support 
introduced in macOS 
Sierra, allowing one or 
more VM windows to 
collapse into a small 
floating view. This allows 
users to monitor activity 
and works even when a

delivers the upcoming People Bar to your macOS Dock as well.

video is playing; PiP windows are semi-
translucent by default, but you can adjust
to fully opaque using a slider in settings.
It wouldn’t be a new version
without a few enhancements to
existing features. Retina
Display owners—nearly half of
all Parallels Desktop users—will
see improvements in scaled
resolutions, while resizing VM
windows is now much
smoother. The update also
delivers up to 47 percent faster
performance when running
Windows on the Mac, up to 50
percent faster Snapshot
creation, and near-native read/
write speeds from external
Thunderbolt SSDs. Last but not
least, PD13 has a 
refreshed icon and 
look—I was mildly 
disappointed to see 
the company abandon 
the dark Control 
Center theme, 
however.
The timing is good 
for those lamenting 
Apple’s decision to 
retire creaky old pro 
video apps like Final 
Cut Pro 7. Since these 
32-bit apps no longer 
run in High Sierra, I was able to create a 
new macOS 10.12.6 Sierra VM from my 
Recovery Partition in just a few clicks using 
PD13’s Installation Assistant so I 
can quickly access older 
projects should the need arise.
BOTTOM LINE
Full support for macOS High 
Sierra and the upcoming 
Windows 10 Fall Creators 
Update would be good enough 
reasons to upgrade, but 
conveniences like Touch Bar 
for Windows apps and picture-
in-picture support keep 
Parallels Desktop 13 atop the 
Mac virtualization throne for 
another year. ■

hardware is outstanding for media 
streaming and backup on a home network.
The only downside is the occasional 
need for above-average tech chops for 
things like setting up a website server or 
FTP backup. If that doesn’t faze you, then 
the RN422 (or any of its siblings: the 
RN424, RN426, or RN428, offering four, 
six, and eight drive bays respectively) will 
serve you well. Pun intended.
DESIGN AND FEATURES
The RN422 is a two-bay box with a front-
panel LCD and five modern-looking, 
blue-backlit buttons that you can use to 
view the box’s status and perform simple 
functions. Flip that part of the box to the 
side and you have access to the easy-
change drive bays. Below the swing panel 
and drive bays is a single USB 3.0 port.
The back of the RN422 is home to a 
pair of gigabit ethernet ports, a second USB 
3.0 port, an eSATA port, the power jack, 
and a Kensington lock port. The chassis 
and shell are largely black and of mostly 
metal construction. The RN422 is hefty 
enough to stay where it’s put, even if you 
install lightweight SSDs. The same can’t be 
said for NAS boxes largely made of plastic.
The two bays feature trays with plastic 
screw-replacing inserts for hard drive 
installation. It’s easy, at least once you spot 
the diagram on the tray that shows you 
how to work them: Slide up the same tab 
that releases the tray from the bay and the 
insert will slide out about 4 inches, so you 
can bend out the sides and slide in the 
hard drive. Press in the second slide-stop 
where it catches on a hole to completely 
remove the insert for SSD installation, 
which does require screws.
SETUP AND APPS
Netgear recommends setting up the 
RN422 via the ReadyCloud.Netgear.com 
(go.macworld.com/rcng) web portal; 
With dual gigabit ethernet ports—whether 
used for for doubling throughput or failover 
protection—the RN422 is as fast and as 
reliable as they come.

however, we wanted to take the front

That’s fine, as it could save you from 
accidentally overwriting important data, but 
the front panel doesn’t take you any 
further. That’s a bit of a tease for IT types 
who might like to administer the box from 
the front panel.
The web portal didn’t work for us either 
for some reason, so we downloaded 
Netgear’s RAIDar utility, which found the 
box and allowed us to reformat the drive. 
Alternatives are a good thing. And if the 
web portal works for you—even better.
Once up and running, we were 
impressed with ReadyNAS OS 6.8. It’s 
improved since our look at version 6.6 on 
the RN212, and there are quite a few apps 
available, including BitTorrent, Drupal, and 
an iDrive client. Our only major wish is for 
an email server, but that’s a small-business 
thing that will affect few users. Speaking of 
business, it would be nice if setting up a 
website server was little less convoluted.
For multimedia purposes, there are 
both iTunes and DLNA media servers, as 
well as Nero MediaHome, the ReadyNAS 
Photo server, and the DVBLink TV server 
for attached USB TV tuners. There’s no 
version of the increasingly popular Plex 
Media Server 
available, though 
we’re fans of the 
more transparent, 
non-proprietary 
DLNA (go.macworld.
com/mtnp).
Also on hand is 
Milestone Arcus 
Surveillance with two 
camera licenses, so 
you can cover the 
front yard as well as 
the back. Additional 
licenses are available 
at $60 each, 4 for 
$200, or 8 for $360. 
That’s not cheap, but 
Though you may need to spend some time with the user’s guide, you’ll 
be glad you did. There’s not much that the RN422 isn’t capable of.

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   121
it’s pretty much par for the course (for 
business-class NVR—network video 
recording—that is). Most users should be 
able to cope with only the two free licenses.
BACKUP FOR DAYS
The ReadyNAS OS has great integrated 
backup capabilities, including remote 
replication (mirroring to another box or 
location, including cloud-storage services 
such as Amazon Cloud Drive, Dropbox, 
and Google Drive) and the ability to back 
up to and from remote locations using FTP 
and Rsync. Read our treatise on backing 
up your network PCs (go.macworld.com/
tobu) without the 
use of client 
software here.
We still have 
the same gripe 
about FTP as we 
did with the 
RN212: You can’t 
browse the 
remote site; 
instead, you must 
manually enter the 
path of the remote 
shared folder. 
Here’s hoping you 
wrote it down.
But that’s 
hardly a deal-killer, 
and most users 
will probably opt for the ReadyCloud 
backup clients that are available for major 
operating systems and mobile devices. 
Clients are the easier, albeit less 
transparent way to keep your PCs and 
devices backed up to the RN422.
A FAST PERFORMER
As we mentioned up front, Netgear boxes 
are usually very fast. Using a dual-core, 
1.5GHz Intel Atom Processor C3338 CPU 
and 2GB of memory, and running the BTRFS 
(B-TRee File System, often called the “Better” 
or “Butter” FS), the RN422 clocked 108MBps

CrystalDiskMark. That’s 
actually a bit slower 
than the RN212 we 
reviewed earlier this 
year (go.macworld.

the RN422 really took 
off was with queued 
reads and writes: It 
absolutely blew away 
every other box we’ve 
tested to date. That’s 
particularly meaningful 
considering that’s the 
way data is generally 
served up these days.
In our own real-world 20GB large-file
copy tests, the RN422 read dead steady at
111MBps and wrote at 114MBps. With our 20GB
mix of smaller files and folders, it 
managed 87MBps reading and 
77MBps writing. Those are very 
good numbers.
Subjectively, the RN422 
was a joy to use. The 
configuration pages popped 
up quickly and we didn’t spend 
a lot of time waiting for folders 
to open or for the box to 
appear. The streaming 
performance was exceptional, 
with five devices streaming 
720p video from the RN422 
simultaneously with ease.

will lament the loss of the USB port, if for 
no other reason than it was an easy way to 
record the screen and take screenshots.
Internally, the same 32GB and 64GB 
storage options remain but the processor 
has been upgraded to an A10x Fusion, the 
same silicon you’ll find in the iPad Pro. 
That’s three full generations ahead of the 
A8 chip in the non-4K model—apps launch 
quicker, navigation is faster, and streams 
(even 4K ones) start nearly instantly. With 
the 4K content library ever expanding, the 
extra power will certainly help.
PLUG AND PLAY
Setup on the Apple TV has always been 
one of its strongest suits, and the 4K 
model hasn’t changed that. Hooking it up 
is as simple as plugging it in and attaching 
it to your 4K TV via an HDMI 2.0 cable. 
Apple still doesn’t supply an HDMI cable in 
been pioneering features, but in 2017 
they’re practically obligatory. Apple had no 
choice but to add 4K support just to 
ensure Apple TV isn’t completely 
overlooked by videophiles. It’s late to the 
party, but it just so happens that Apple TV 
4K doesn’t feel like an afterthought. It 
might not bring anything to the table that 
you don’t get with the far-less-expensive 
Chromecast Ultra, Roku Streaming Stick 
Plus, or Fire TV with 4K Ultra HD, but 
Apple’s elegant simplicity, ease of use, and 
iTunes advantage are all on full display 
here. If you have a 4K television, this is the 
model you’ve been waiting for.
STILL HIP TO BE SQUARE
Other than the ability to play 2160p 
content, there’s not a whole lot that’s 
different about the new Apple TV. It’s 
dressed in black with the exact same 
cubic dimensions as the 
fourth-generation model. The 
only changes to speak of are 
a gigabit ethernet port 
(another overdue addition) 
and the removal of the USB 
diagnostic port.
A 10/100/1000 port is great 
for those who have a weak 
wireless connection but still 
want lag-free 4K streams. 
However, I suspect most 
developers (and this reviewer) 
Apple TV 4K requires just two cables to get up and 
running—but you’ll have to bring one of them along.

the box, and its $179 price tag would be a 
lot easier to swallow if it did.
Apple has utilized the same one-tap 
setup method it introduced with AirPods, 
and it’s just as magical here. Instead of 
using the Siri Remote to tediously type 
your lengthy iCloud and Wi-Fi passwords, 
your Apple TV will automatically pull over 
all that information from your iPhone. As 
long as your phone is within range, a 
message will pop up on your screen that 
will quickly walk you through the 
authentication process.
After setup, however, the new Apple 
TV’s main input device is still the Siri 
remote, and if you hated it before, you’ll 
probably hate this one just as much. It’s 
nearly identical, save one difference—
there’s a white plastic ring around the 
menu button. While it seems like a passive 
aggressive move to appease the critics, 
it actually does make it a little easier to 
use in the dark by feeling for the menu 
button. But otherwise, the remote has 
the same minimal six-button functionality.
4K QUALITY AT HD PRICES
When you get to the home screen, the 
4K difference is instantly noticeable. 
App icons are crisper and clearer than 
before, and the dark mode (which can 
now be set to change automatically) is 
particularly impressive.
But all you’re going to want to do is 
find 4K content. Apple has kindly updated 
your iTunes collection with any available 
4K titles, an awesome perk if you’re 
someone who has a large digital movie 
collection. This includes any movies that 
were purchased through the iTunes Store 
or digital copies that came with Blu-ray 
discs, so if you haven’t been dutifully 
entering them, go dig them out.
If you have an iPhone nearby, setting up your 
new Apple TV is a piece of cake.

REVIEW: APPLE 4K TV
Unfortunately, the Movies apps won’t 
break down your iTunes library by 
resolution, so you’ll need to go title by title 
to find out which ones have been updated. 
You can ask Siri for help, but it’ll only 
retrieve a small list of newly released 4K 
movies, not necessarily ones that are in 
your library. To see if a title can be 
streamed in 4K, navigate to a movie, 
click on it, and look at the resolution 
box next to the year of release.
Of note, Disney hasn’t agreed to the 
terms of Apple’s 4K updates, so any Pixar 
or Marvel flicks won’t get the 4K treatment. 
(Star Wars movies, too, but they aren’t 
available anywhere in 4K yet.) There are 
two notable Marvel exceptions, however: 
Deadpool and Spider-Man: Homecoming 
are distributed by Fox and Sony, so Disney 
doesn’t have control over them. The same 
applies to the newest Fantastic Four flick, 
but you’re less likely to want to watch that.
While the Apple TV certainly has enough 
internal storage for several 4K movies, you 
can only stream 4K movies, not download 
them, so the strength of your connection will 
be a factor, as will any bandwidth caps 
imposed by your broadband provider.
THE HUNT FOR 4K CONTENT
Elsewhere, 4K content is pretty limited. You 
can find some titles in the Netflix app, but 
the Movies Anywhere and Hulu apps only 
play in 1080p, and the Amazon Video 
player is still MIA. And Apple TV 4K also 
doesn’t support YouTube’s 4K content.
However, most of the iTunes titles I 
tested were quite impressive. My television 
supports 4K but not HDR10 or Dolby Vision, 
but video quality is still way sharper than on 
my 1080p set. 
Newer movies 
such as John Wick 
2 or The Lego 
Batman Movie 
were stellar, with 
deep blacks and 
minimal motion 
blur, but older 
flicks weren’t as 
good. My copy of 
Goodfellas looked 
much better in 
1080p, and the 4K

benefits on Blade Runner: The Final Cut 
were hit and miss.
Your Apple TV 4K will automatically 
detect your TV’s output capabilities as 
before, but you can change them by 
heading to the Audio and Video option 
inside the Settings app. From there, 
you’ll see a TV Resolution menu that will 
let you switch back to 1080p. You can’t 
select which version of a stream you 
want to play, so for some movies 
you’ll want to revert to HD.
One thing that’s consistently stellar 
on the 4K Apple TV are the aerial 
screensavers. There aren’t any new ones, 
but it’s like you’re looking at them for the first 
time. Every video has been updated and 
optimized for 4K, and quite honestly, they 
might be reason enough to plunk down $179 
on a new box. Seriously, they’re that good.
THE BEST OPERATING SYSTEM 
GETS EVEN BETTER
Above all, Apple’s main Apple TV 
advantage is tvOS. The interface is leaps 
and bounds above Roku’s and Amazon’s, 
and far superior to Chromecast’s beam-
and-stream method. Even with the Siri 
remote, it’s a joy to use.
tvOS 11 doesn’t bring too many 
changes to Apple TV 4K, but there are a 
couple of notable improvements. My 
favorite is Home Screen Sync, which uses

Apple has also made it easier 
to connect AirPods. Apple’s 
wireless earbuds will automatically show

A FEW STEPS FROM PERFECT
Apple TV 4K is awfully close to being an 
iTunes fan’s dream cutting-edge home 
theater streamer, but it’s missing one key 
component. Apple TV 4K supports the 
same Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound 
as the non-4K Apple TV, which means it 
won’t sound as good as some of its peers.
That’s because it doesn’t support 
Dolby Atmos, the latest in 3D sound tech. 
Granted, you’ll need a system that 
supports it and the vast majority of 
listeners won’t be able to tell the 
difference even if they do, but if you’re 
spending $179 on a 4K streaming box, 
you’d expect it to check off every box. 
Apple told The Verge that it will be adding 
support in a future 
update, but that 
doesn’t make it 
any less of an 
unfortunate 
limitation, 
especially since 
Roku’s Streaming 
Stick Plus and 
Amazon’s Fire TV 
with 4K Ultra HD 
both support it.
Siri is also

disappointment. It’s 
not all that much 
smarter than it was 
before. For example, 
if you ask to see 4K 
movies in your iTunes 
library, it will take you 
to the Movies app 
but won’t suggest 
any titles. And while 
you can use your 
Echo to control Fire 
TV or   your Google 
Home to send videos to Chromecast, Siri
is still mostly a navigation tool on Apple TV
4K, accessible via the bundled remote or
the iOS app. It’s possible that HomePod
changes that when it arrives in December,
but Apple hasn’t tipped us off to that level
of functionality. It would be nice
to say, “Hey Siri, put on the
Warriors game,” some day, but
that may have to wait until the
next revision.

any more than the previous

There may be other digital 
media players that can match

to picture quality and even beat 
it with sound, but none of them

S
o, you want to build a streaming
service.
At this point, the evidence
that Apple is jumping into
streaming is incontrovertible. You don’t
pony up a boatload of cash for the likes of
Steven Spielberg and not build a
streaming service. Nor do you just shove
that into Apple Music, a platform which has
proved to be only half-baked when it
comes to streaming video.
No, this kind of $1 billion investment
seems to call for a major revision to
infrastructure as well. This is a serious
investment, and so of course Apple’s
going to want to be serious about how it
builds a service. So, let’s take a look at
what’s critical in such an endeavor.
How Apple can build a better 
video streaming service   
With its video push, Apple rows gently down the stream. Here’s how it  
can keep up with the competition.
BY DAN MOREN

130   MACWORLD   DECEMBER 2017

PUT IT ALL TOGETHER 
Here’s the thing: Apple’s already got all 
the ingredients for a successful streaming 
service. It’s got massive data centers, it’s 
used to delivering huge amounts of 
content, and it has tons of deployed 
devices in the mobile and living room 
spaces. In some ways, the only surprise is 
that Apple has waited this long to deploy a 
service—all it seemingly lacked was the 
will to do so.
But, as with music, the company took a 
very purchase-oriented approach to video 
at first. The late Steve Jobs famously said 
that nobody wanted to rent their music—
streaming audio services have proved that 
wrong. People are plenty happy to rent 
music, assuming that the system doesn’t 
unduly hamper them in the enjoyment of 
that music by putting onerous restrictions 
on where, when, and how they can listen.
And, as in music, purchasing digital 
video has been losing ground to 
streaming. You need look no further 
than the recent launch of Movies 
Anywhere (go.macworld.com/movi) to 
see that the content producers are finally 
trying to make buying digital movies work 
the way they always should have. That’s 
because streaming is eating their lunch. 
Meanwhile, Apple is watching all the 
companies raking down money from 
video streaming and realizing that it too 
can have a piece of the pie—if it’s willing 
to invest. And that’s led us to where we 
are today.
THE WAY IT WORKS
Now that it seems pretty certain an Apple 
streaming service is in our future, the 
question is only what such a service 
looks like.
Some of this we can make educated 
guesses about, based on the company’s 
experience with Apple Music. There will 
probably be single user and family 
options. There will likely be a free three-
month trial to get people accustomed to 
using the service. And it will almost 
certainly be tightly integrated with Apple’s 
existing video options.
That last one is important. Back when 
Apple first announced its TV app for both 
iOS and tvOS, I postulated that the current 
version of it was just the beginning (go.
macworld.com/tvpl):
But it makes perfect sense when you 
imagine [the TV app] as the distribution 
point for Apple’s upcoming in-house 
content. The company may not have 
conclusively won the battle for Input 1 in 
the living room, but if screenshots of the 
new TV app are any indication, it’s 
aiming to have spot number one on 
your Apple TV’s home screen. That app 
will be a prominent place to feature all 
of Apple’s upcoming series, easily

surfacing them for viewers who want to 
watch them as well as anyone who 
hasn’t heard about them yet. 
I strongly believe that Apple’s video 
content will live, and of course be 
prominently featured, in the TV app. Not 
only does it already have a spot on 
Apple’s platforms, but it’s also been 
integrated with users’ existing library of 
videos from iTunes. More to the point, 
putting video anywhere else would be a 
bit of a head-scratcher, as Apple has 
worked to promote the TV app as a 
one-stop shop for your video content.
PASSION PLAY
Besides Apple’s own push into original 
content, there remains a question of what 
else an Apple streaming video service 
might contain. Of the many pieces of 
original content the company is going to 
be developing, not all are going to be 
ready when Apple wants to launch the 
service—nor should they be, since 
Apple’s not going to want to dump 
them all at once. So it’s likely that 
catalog will need to be filled out
with content from other sources.
Which brings us back 
around to the long-running idea
of an Apple streaming 
television service. Look, I have 
to believe that the bottom has 
fallen out of the à-la-carte-TV-episode 
market. With Netflix, Hulu, and 
everybody and their dog offering some 
sort of streaming option, very few people 
are likely to pony up the cost to buy a 
full season of TV. (At least in the U.S., 
where such things are broadly available.) 
If Apple can strike a deal for streaming 
of current TV, I think that would be 
appealing—if it can’t, then the company’s 
going to have to rely on a back catalog 
of TV shows. And, if this is truly a serve 
with serialized content, it’s going to need 
at least some TV shows—especially in 
this current climate of Peak TV. 
Apple’s already made huge strides in 
pushing forward digital music, but video 
has always been a tricky proposition for 
the company, for the simple reason that 
it doesn’t seem to care as much about 
TV and movies as it does about music. 
The hiring of key personnel to handle 
the content side of the business has 
made strides in that direction, but 
Apple’s got to tap into that same 
passion if it’s going to sell its customers 
on this service. ■
Besides Apple’s own push into original 
content, there remains a question of 
what else an Apple streaming video 
service might contain.

REVIEW: SONOS ONE
Once you have that, 
you can control any 
Sonos speaker from 
any Amazon Echo.
There are some 
limitations you’ll want 
to be aware of: You’ll 
need to use the 
Sonos app to group 
two or more Sonos 
speakers together 
(and to split them 
apart). But once 
you’ve done that, 
you can tell Alexa to 
play the artist or song of your choice on 
any of the speakers in that group.
Including the Sonos One reviewed 
here, my Sonos system has six speakers: 
Garage, Kitchen, Living Room, Master 
Bedroom, Media Room, and Sun Room. If 
I click the Everywhere button in the 
Sonos app, I can tell Alexa to play music 
in any of those rooms, and she’ll play the 
same music all over the house. If I group 
the Media Room and the Sun Room 
together, I just need to tell her play 
music in either the Media Room or the 
Sun Room, and music will play in both 
rooms. And if I split all the rooms apart 
again, I can stream different music to 
each room. That’s not the only time 
you’ll need the Sonos app, but I’ll get 
into that later.
SPEAKER DESIGN
The Sonos One bears a very close 
resemblance to the Sonos Play:1 (go.
macworld.com/ply1), introduced this time of 
year way back in 2013. Both speakers are 
two-way models with separate woofers 
and tweeters, and the cabinets are nearly 
identical. But Sonos says it carried very 
little over from its older design. The 
onboard amplifier is the same, but the 
power supply has been redesigned. 
“Other than that,” according to my contact, 
“the only shared parts are the bottom 
rubber feet and bottom plastic cap.”
Beyond the color of the grille, the most 
noticeable difference between the new 
and old speakers is the top. The Sonos 
One is perfectly flat, with the type of 
touch-sensitive controls for play/pause and

volume up/down that you’ll find on its big 
sibling—the Play:5. You’ll also find a touch-
sensitive button for muting the on-board 
mic that you’ll use to summon your digital 
assistant of choice, and an LED that glows 
when the mic is on.
That’s the opposite behavior of 
Amazon’s (and Google’s) smart speakers. 
Those of us who have an aversion to the 
light pollution created by the proliferation 
of LEDs won’t like it at all. Another feature I 
don’t like: The speaker emits a tone when 
it hears its wake word. If you’ve been 
cranking the tunes and forgot to turn the 
speaker down, that tone can be startling 
when the room is otherwise silent. No big 
deal, right? You can just change those 
settings in the Sonos app. Except you 
can’t. The locked-in arrangement “…
ensures that the customer has confidence 
in the status of the microphone at all 
times,” was the 
response to my 
fact-check question.
One other major 
difference: The new 
speaker has a pairing 
button where the 
¼-inch threaded 
mount is located on 
the older model. 
Sonos tells me this 
enabled them “to 
maximize the 
components in the speaker, and also 
made room for our partners to innovate on 
great ways to mount the” speaker. Okay, 
but there’s already a world of mounts 
available for Sonos speakers. Was it 
necessary to render them obsolete?
AUDIO PERFORMANCE
Any lingering doubt that Sonos simply 
added mics and new firmware to transform 
the Play:One into the Sonos One will be 
dispelled as soon as you hear the new 
speaker. Sonos’ entry-level speaker has 
long been my least favorite in the 
company’s lineup. It’s not a bad product, 
it’s just too bright to my ears. It desperately 
needs to be paired with the gut-punching 
(but wallet-punishing) Sonos Sub. Then 
again, $699 is a lot of dough just to 
reinforce a $200 speaker.

REVIEW: SONOS ONE
“Squibb Cakes,” from the band’s album 
Back to Oakland, which I’d ripped from CD 
and encoded to FLAC, the Sonos One 
impressed me with its much bigger bass 
response and improved midrange. 
Stephen Kupka’s bari sax sounded so 
much fatter than it did on the older 
speaker. And where Chester Thomposon’s 
frenetic work on the Hammond B3 
seemed to have difficulty emerging from 
the Play:One, it happily bubbled up to its 
due prominence on the Sonos One.
The Play:One delivered great 
performances with more acoustic fare as 
well, beautifully rendering the two-part 
harmony of The Unthanks’ aching rendition 
of the Scottish folksong “Anachie Gordon,” 
from the duo’s release A Retrospective. I 
acquired that recording in Apple Lossless 
format from Bowers & Wilkins’ Society of 
Sound download service.
PERFORMANCE AS 
A SMART SPEAKER
When I first tested the Sonos One, I set it 
up in my kitchen, where I was also testing 
Amazon’s Echo Show. When I’d forget to 
mute the Sonos, its more sensitive mic 
array would invariably cause it to beep 
when it heard the wake word, but the Echo 
Show would always wrest control and 
respond to my commands—even if it was 
farther away. The problem disappeared as 
soon as I moved the Sonos One into my 
home theater for my critical listening tests. 
In there, the speaker consistently 
impressed me with its ability to hear my 
voice even when it was playing music very 
loudly. Actually, when any Amazon Echo 
hears the Alexa wake word, all of the 
speakers will shush until you’ve finished 
speaking and the Echo (or the Sonos) in 
control has responded to you. The music 
then returns to its previous level.
Add a Sonos One and you can control 
every Sonos speaker on your network 
with voice commands.

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   137
For all the praise I’ve heaped on the
Sonos One, there are a couple of things
that I really don’t like about it. My first
complaint: Sonos supports more than 80
music services from within its app: Spotify,
Tidal, Deezer, LastFM, and many, many
more. But when you ask Alexa to play a
song, an artist, or an album on one of your
Sonos speakers, you’ll get music only from
the services that Amazon supports. And if
you don’t specify which service you want
to use, Alexa defaults to Amazon Music.
Amazon also supports iHeartRadio,
Pandora, SiriusXM, TuneIn, and Spotify, but
you must ask for those services by name.
And Amazon won’t pass Spotify streams
through to its partner’s hardware—even if
you’re a paid Spotify 
subscriber. The good news: 
Sonos says it will be Amazon’s 
first partner to gain that 
privilege later this year.
My second complaint: As 
with Amazon’s own Echo 
speakers, Sonos offers no way 
to ask Alexa to play music 
that’s stored on my own local 
network. I use both Spotify and 
Tidal, and I’ve been dallying 
with SiriusXM. But I’ve also 
amassed a large collection of 
music on CD over the years, 
and I’ve painstakingly ripped 
each of those discs, encoded

them to the lossless audio codec FLAC, 
and stored them on a NAS box. I’ve also 
purchased and downloaded many albums 
in lossless formats—that album from The 
Unthanks that I mentioned earlier, for 
instance. Some of those albums aren’t 
available for streaming from any service.
If you initiate a stream from your own 
server—or from one of the services that 
Sonos supports but Amazon doesn’t—
using the Sonos app, you can ask Alexa to 
move back and forth through your playlist 
or queue. You can even ask her what song 
is playing, and she’ll tell you the name of 
the song, album, and artist. Ask her to play 
a specific artist, album, or song, however, 
and she’ll go back to Amazon Music.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Unless you find the drawbacks 
I’ve described to be deal-
breakers, the Sonos One is a 
no-brainer. That goes double 
for anyone who already owns 
Sonos components, and triple 
for Amazon Echo users. We’ll 
have to wait and see if Sonos 
executes as expertly with its 
Google Assistant and Apple 
AirPlay 2 efforts, but I’m 
optimistic on those counts 
based on past experience. The 
Sonos One is the best smart 
speaker I’ve heard yet. ■

much slicker solution that runs on
Apple TV and iOS 
devices rather than a 
clunky set-top box.
Channels also 
excels at the little 
things, like loading 
live channels quickly, 
and preserving the full video
and audio quality of broadcast TV. If
the service could just fix some of its
other shortcomings, it could be the
undisputed DVR champ--at least for
Apple device owners.
FOR APPLE USERS ONLY
Channels DVR runs on Apple TV (fourth-
generation and higher) and iOS devices, 
with each app priced at $15. But those 
apps are only part of the equation.
To capture live TV, Channels requires 
one of SiliconDust’s HDHomeRun 
networked tuners (go.macworld.com/hdhr), 
which connect to a Wi-Fi router via 
ethernet cable for streaming video 
throughout the house. For antenna users, 
the HDHomeRun Connect costs $100, 
while the $180 Extend model adds built-in 
transcoding, which requires less bandwidth 
for streaming live TV. (Transcoding also 
shrinks the size of recorded video, but 
Channels’ software can handle this for 
Connect users.) Either model can watch 
and record up to two programs at once, 
but Channels can also combine input from 
multiple tuners if you want to record more. 
For cable subscribers, Channels also 
works with HDHomeRun Prime, which 
uses a CableCARD to record unencrypted 
pay-TV channels.
Beyond the tuner itself, you also need 
a device to record the videos, along with a 
hard drive that has ample storage. To that 
end, Channels offers server software for 
Windows, Mac, NAS boxes (go.macworld.
com/nabo), and the Nvidia Shield TV  
(go.macworld.com/nvsh). (Just bear in 
mind there is no client app for watching 
video directly on the Shield.)
Channels also requires a DVR 
subscription for $8 per month. That’s $3 
per month more than DVR service through 
Plex (go.macworld.com/p1ex) or Tablo  
(go.macworld.com/tabl), and there are no

discounts for annual or lifetime service. All 
told, you could pay upwards of $500 for 
an HDHomerun tuner, server device, hard 
drive, and at least one Apple TV, and that’s 
before the subscription fees. That’s a 
tough sell if you have none of the requisite 
hardware, but it becomes more 
economical if you already own a desktop 
computer or NAS box.
SLICK SOFTWARE (WITH 
A FEW  MISSING FEATURES)
Channels does get much simpler once 
everything’s in place. After installing the 
server software, a browser-based tool lets 
you scan for channels, specify a DVR 
storage location, and adjust advanced 
settings such as transcode quality and 
tuner priority. You can then manage 
recordings through iOS, Apple TV, or the 
web tool.
The app provides plenty of control 
over how those recordings behave. In the 
server app, you can set global settings for 
recording buffer times and how many 
recent episodes of a program to keep. 
Those same settings are available on a 
per-show basis in the Channels app. And 
beyond just TV shows and movies, you 
can set up series passes for sports teams, 
which Channels will record 
across any channel. That’s handy 
for when your favorite football is 
playing on Sunday or Thursday 
night. The only thing that’s absent 
is a way to filter out recordings by 
resolution or by channel.
Still, Channels is missing a few 
options that would make 
recording easier. Although you 
can search for individual 
programs, or browse the grid 
guide to see what’s coming up, 
Channels provides lots of ways to fine-tune 
recordings.
The Channels web tool lets you manage DVR settings 
and watch TV.

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   141
you can’t browse programs by genre or 
channel. And while Channels’ web app 
offers suggestions on shows and movies 
to add, these don’t appear in the iOS and 
Apple TV apps. One of the joys of over-
the-air DVR is discovering all the great 
movies and shows that air on random 
channels, but Channels makes this trickier.
Conflict resolution is also lacking. 
Although you can prioritize programs so 
that your favorites don’t get passed over, 
Channels provides no warnings when 
you’ve overbooked the DVR. To weed out 
conflicts, you must manually scroll through 
the recording schedule, looking for 
instances of overlap in each time slot. 
Out-of-home viewing is also supported 
for live and recorded programs after 
you’ve linked an account through the 
Channels app, and it works with both 
iOS and Apple TV. You can also access 
Channels remotely through a web 
browser at my.channelsdvr.net.
ADS BEGONE
After completing a recording, Channels 
DVR analyzes the video for commercial 
breaks, which then appear as dark lines in 
the video progress bar. By double-clicking 
the Apple TV remote’s fast forward button 
during a break, Channels jumps directly to 
the point where programming resumes. If 
you haven’t used a TiVo or other 
ad-skipping DVR before, this will probably

There are some caveats:
Channels acknowledges that

click forward or backward to

because the analysis doesn’t

is over, you can’t automatically
skip ads partway through a live
broadcast. Still, having an
option to ad-skip is far more
convenient than 
manually scrolling

30-second increments.

Safari bookmark sync out of 
whack? Here’s the solution
iCloud has a feature that lets you sync 
your Safari bookmarks across your Macs, 
iPhones, and iPads. However, Macworld
reader Mark has a tale that sounds nearly 
appropriate for Halloween: disappearing 
and haunted bookmarks:
I upgraded my MacBook recently and 
transferred everything across 
surprisingly easy. After a few weeks, the 
bookmarks disappeared in favor of the 
defaults (Apple, Netflix, BBC iPlayer, 
YouTube, Facebook). I recovered 
following your advice with Time 
Machine, but after a few minutes or 
hours or even days, they switch 
back to default again.
I suggested to Mark that this sounded 
like an out-of-phase synchronization 
problem. With iCloud enabled to sync 
Safari in iOS and macOS, it sounds as 
though iCloud decided the “truth” of the 
bookmark state was the defaults loaded 
before his upgrade. Every time he 
restored to an earlier version via Time 

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   145
Machine, iCloud sync kept deciding that 
was out of date and replaced it with what it 
thought was “newer.”
My advice was to disable Safari in 
the iCloud system preference pane. 
Restore the bookmarks. Let things settle 
down. Then re-enable. Sure enough, 
that stopped the default/correct 
bookmark flapping.
Why Apple shows a strange 
location for a two-factor login 
confirmation
Erich Riehl uses Apple’s two-factor 
authentication (2FA) system with his iCloud 
account. This is the system that Apple 
released in September 2015, and which 
replaces the older two-step system 
entirely in iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 High 
Sierra. (If you’re using two-step and 
upgrade to either of those, Apple 
converts you to 2FA.)
The first step in Apple’s 2FA is a 
location alert that appears on every 
computer and iOS you own logged into 
the same Apple ID account. The notion is 
that you should validate that the location is 
correct before you proceed to get the 
code. Clicking Don’t Allow terminates the 
login attempt.
For Erich, however, he’s seeing a login 
attempt from Monroe, Louisiana, which he 
found confusing. He gets this alert when 
he is trying to log in at iCloud.com, and 
wondered if it were legitimate.
Because Apple doesn’t explain when 
you log in that it’s going to alert you on all 
your connected devices, this can seem 
counter-intuitive when you’re using a 
browser—because the device from which 
you’re logging in tells you there’s a login 
attempt.
The location can also be imprecise. My 
wife routinely is told she’s logging in from 
about 30 miles south, although on 
the same home network, it’s more 
accurate for me. If we both had this 
issue, I’d expect that the IP address 
of our network was misplaced in 
whatever geo-identification system 
Apple relied on to match IPs with a 
rough place on the globe. (I 
checked with Erich, and his ISP is 
based in Louisiana, and it only 
happens when he tries to log in.)
If you’re using a VPN (virtual 

146   MACWORLD   DECEMBER 2017
HELPDESK

private network), you may be told that 
you’re logging in from far away as well! 
Keep that in mind if you’re worried about 
someone intercepting your connection—
the far end of your session, where Apple 
“sees” you connecting to the Internet, is 
almost always going to be one of the data 
centers at which the VPN service has its 
servers located.
I wrote earlier about whether it’s a 
good idea (go.macworld.com/goid) to 
allow you to confirm your identity from the 
same machine you’re trying to log in from.
How to remove old sent 
messages from Mail in macOS
Email is one of those programs that you 
use, and then you realize that you have 
files dating back from a long time ago. 
Macworld reader Chris want to take 
control of the message in Apple’s Mail, 
specifically the messages he has sent.
I swear I used to be able to control how 
long my sent mailbox kept old sent 
messages—I’m sure I set it to 1 month! 
Now, however, I cannot find any pop-up 
or drop-down menus (like Junk Mailbox, 
which I have set to erase after one 
week). I don’t want all my old Sent 
messages from 1998!
I don’t recall a way to delete sent 
messages automatically in Mail. However, 
you can create a rule that will solve the 
problem for you:
> Select Mail → Preferences and click 
the Rules button.
> Click Add Rule.
> Name the rule “Delete Sent 
Messages” or however you’d like to 
identify it.
> From the conditions area, choose 
Date Sent, Is Greater Than, and then 
enter the number of days. In this example, I 
used 365 days.
> In the Perform the Following Actions 
section, choose Delete Message.
> Click OK.
> You’re prompted to apply to existing 
messages. If you click Apply, this will 
immediately (and irrevocably) delete all 
sent message that meet that criteria.

DECEMBER 2017   MACWORLD   147
Now, Mail won’t apply this rule after this 
point, because active rules apply only to 
your inboxes. However, you can every 
once in a while select the Sent mailbox in 
the Mailboxes list and then choose 
Message → Apply Rules.
You can choose a different tactic if you 
just want to archive messages locally. 
Create an archive mailbox in the On This 
Mac section of the Mailboxes list: hover 
over On This Mac, click the +, and then 
name the mailbox. In step 5, choose Move 
Message and then pick the mailbox you 
created under On This Mac.
How to better manage your 
iCloud file storage
Apple’s iCloud is handy in that it lets you 
have access to your files on multiple 
devices that have internet access. But 
what’s actually stored in iCloud isn’t 
that obvious to the user.
This seems to be the case for 
Macworld reader Izabella. She asks 
why iCloud isn’t reducing storage 
on her MacBook more than it is. 
She sees iCloud storage on her 
computer taking up 80GB of 
storage but says she’s paying for 
200GB of iCloud storage. “I want to 
use this space for other things,” she 
notes.
iCloud doesn’t necessarily save 
you storage, as confusing as that is, 
because it’s a mix of synchronization and 
cloud-based storage options.
> iCloud Photo Library syncs all your 
photos and videos, but unless you set 
Photos (in Photos → Preferences → iCloud 
to Optimize Mac Storage), the full-
resolution file for each piece of media 
remains on your Mac. Check that box, 
and you could save 80 to 90 percent of 
a library’s size.
> iCloud Music Library also syncs 
music, but lets you keep local files unless 
you take action. You can select songs or 
albums and Control-click to select Remove 
Download, which deletes locally stored 
files and leaves the backups in iCloud. (Be 
sure you have a backup of your music files 
before you do this! Things can go wrong.) 
If you want to know which songs are only 
in the cloud, create a Smart Playlist with 
the criteria Location Is Not On This 
Computer.
> iCloud Drive is always synced: a 
This rule deletes old Sent mail, but has to be triggered 
manually after the initial creation.

iCloud for everything listed except for the
next item!
> Desktop & Documents is an option
(introduced in macOS 10.12 Sierra) to shift
and sync less-used files from those two
Home folder locations to the cloud, and
only download them locally as needed.
You can access that option via ; →About
This Mac →Storage and click Manage (or
via Applications/Utilities/System
Information, and choose Window →
Storage Mananagement), and then click
Store in iCloud. You want a high-speed
broadband connection for the times you
need macOS to retrieve those files.
> iTunes purchases. Also in the storage
manage tab of System Information, you
can opt to delete what can turn out to be
gigabytes of downloaded media that
remains available for retrieval

from the iTunes Store.

could free up tens to 
hundreds of gigabytes of 
storage, depending on the 
amount of media and kinds 
of documents you store on 
your Mac.
A warning, though: you’re
relying on iCloud and Apple
to keep all that data safe for
you. I’d rather have more
storage on my computer, keep all the
iCloud items copied from and to my main
Mac, and separately clone and archive all
those files myself in addition to iCloud. ■
