Preventing Toll Fraud
"Toll fraud" is the unauthorized use of your telecommunications system 
by an unauthorized party (for example, a person who is not a corporate 
employee, agent, subcontractor, or is not working on your company's 
behalf). Be aware that there may be a risk of toll fraud associated with 
your system and that, if toll fraud occurs, it can result in substantial 
additional charges for your telecommunications services.
Avaya Fraud Intervention
If you suspect that you are being victimized by toll fraud and you need 
technical assistance or support, in the United States and Canada, call the 
Technical Service Center's Toll Fraud Intervention Hotline at

Providing Telecommunications Security
Telecommunications security (of voice, data, and/or video 
communications) is the prevention of any type of intrusion to (that is, 
either unauthorized or malicious access to or use of) your company's 
telecommunications equipment by some party.
Your company's "telecommunications equipment" includes both this 
Avaya product and any other voice/data/video equipment that could be 
accessed via this Avaya product (that is, "networked equipment").
An "outside party" is anyone who is not a corporate employee, agent, 
subcontractor, or is not working on your company's behalf. Whereas, a 
"malicious party" is anyone (including someone who may be otherwise 
authorized) who accesses your telecommunications equipment with 
either malicious or mischievous intent.
Such intrusions may be either to/through synchronous (time-multiplexed 
and/or circuit-based), or asynchronous (character-, message-, or 
packet-based) equipment, or interfaces for reasons of:
•
Utilization (of capabilities special to the accessed equipment)
•
Theft (such as, of intellectual property, financial assets, or toll 
facility access)
•
Eavesdropping (privacy invasions to humans)
•
Mischief (troubling, but apparently innocuous, tampering)
•
Harm (such as harmful tampering, data loss or alteration, 
regardless of motive or intent)
Be aware that there may be a risk of unauthorized intrusions associated 
with your system and/or its networked equipment. Also realize that, if 
such an intrusion should occur, it could result in a variety of losses to your 
company (including but not limited to, human/data privacy, intellectual 
property, material assets, financial resources, labor costs, and/or legal 
costs).
Responsibility for Your Company’s Telecommunications Security
The final responsibility for securing both this system and its networked 
equipment rests with you - Avaya’s customer system administrator, your 
telecommunications peers, and your managers. Base the fulfillment of 
your responsibility on acquired knowledge and resources from a variety 
of sources including but not limited to:
•
Installation documents
•
System administration documents
•
Security documents
•
Hardware-/software-based security tools
•
Shared information between you and your peers
•
Telecommunications security experts
To prevent intrusions to your telecommunications equipment, you and 
your peers should carefully program and configure:
•
Your Avaya-provided telecommunications systems and their 
interfaces
•
Your Avaya-provided software applications, as well as their 
underlying hardware/software platforms and interfaces
•
Any other equipment networked to your Avaya products
TCP/IP Facilities
Customers may experience differences in product performance, reliability 
and security depending upon network configurations/design and 
topologies, even when the product performs as warranted.

Federal Communications Commission Statement
Part 15:
Part 68: Answer-Supervision Signaling
Allowing this equipment to be operated in a manner that does not provide 
proper answer-supervision signaling is in violation of Part 68 rules. This 
equipment returns answer-supervision signals to the public switched 
network when:
•
answered by the called station,
•
answered by the attendant, or
•
routed to a recorded announcement that can be administered 
by the customer premises equipment (CPE) user.
This equipment returns answer-supervision signals on all direct inward 
dialed (DID) calls forwarded back to the public switched telephone 
network. Permissible exceptions are:
•
A call is unanswered.
•
A busy tone is received.
•
A reorder tone is received.
Avaya attests that this registered equipment is capable of providing users 
access to interstate providers of operator services through the use of 
access codes. Modification of this equipment by call aggregators to block 
access dialing codes is a violation of the Telephone Operator Consumers 
Act of 1990.

If the terminal equipment (for example, the media server or media 
gateway) causes harm to the telephone network, the telephone company 
will notify you in advance that temporary discontinuance of service may 
be required. But if advance notice is not practical, the telephone 
company will notify the customer as soon as possible. Also, you will be 
advised of your right to file a complaint with the FCC if you believe it is 
necessary.
The telephone company may make changes in its facilities, equipment, 
operations or procedures that could affect the operation of the

Overview
Avaya’s portfolio of Communication Manager applications allows a business to harness the 
power of a converged Internet Protocol (IP)-based voice/data network and put the network to 
work for the business. Driven by Avaya’s rock-solid Communication Manager application, this 
portfolio operates with Avaya’s media servers, media gateways, Integrated Management 
(network-management tools), and communication devices.
Using Avaya’s Communication Manager applications, an enterprise can review the operation of 
its existing communication networks and rethink where IP telephony can maximize returns on 
investment. Then, the enterprise can reshape the network to realize those goals. The options 
are nearly unlimited, given Avaya’s flexible, modular architecture and our commitment to 
standards-based software and hardware.
Avaya brings continuous voice-application innovation to the enterprise. And Communication 
Manager delivers massive new scalability to provide network devices for as few as 20 users, or 
up to a million. Avaya’s Communication Manager application is also highly scalable and reliable 
voice-application software with
●Rich call-processing and contact-center features
●A widely accepted application-programming interface (API) supporting both 3rd-parties’ 
and Avaya’s own applications
Avaya’s media servers and media gateways provide smart ways to rethink networking. They 
add top-tier scalability and reliability, while supporting critical applications in a distributed, yet 
secure, multivendor environment. To provide businesses with maximum flexibility, the server 
and gateway components in Avaya’s family of Communication Manager applications follow a 
modular mix-and-match approach. A wide range of custom configurations can be deployed to 
meet a broad spectrum of business needs:
●From a single location, upgrading to a converged IP network for 200 employees
●To a complex multinational converged network that is capable of supporting 10,000-plus 
voice/data users
Ruggedization of servers and gateways
Some of Avaya’s media servers and gateways were tested against extreme physical and 
environmental requirements such as shock, vibration, and EMI. These tests were performed by 
the United States Navy for media server and gateway use on their ships. The Navy uses 
specialized racks and reinforcements although no physical changes have been made to the 
servers and gateways themselves. Customers that are interested in obtaining information for 
the design and implementation of such a ruggedized solution can contact the Avaya Custom 
Engineering Group.

Avaya media servers
Avaya’s line of media servers provides a robust application platform based on industry-standard 
operating systems. This platform supports distributed IP networking and centralized call 
processing across multiprotocol networks. These servers are available as an integrated solution 
with other servers or can operate independently.
Avaya media servers have the following features and benefits:
●Redundant, survivable call processing and media processing supports crucial business 
continuity.
●Standards-based computing supports Linux, Microsoft Windows, and the Avaya 
DEFINITY® operating system.
●Distributed survivable IP networking supports campus, global-multisite, and branch 
environments.
Avaya media gateways
Avaya media gateways connect to an Avaya media server, either directly or indirectly through 
other media gateways. Media Gateways are the stackable and modular hardware elements of 
your communication system, and they deliver connectivity to a variety of endpoint and trunk 
types – allowing data, voice, FAX, video, and messaging capabilities on your network. The 
connections between media gateways that allow the passage of these media types is called the 
"bearer network." The connections between the media server and the media gateways for call 
control signaling is called the "control network."
Avaya media gateways support both bearer and signaling traffic that is routed between packet- 
and circuit-switched networks. Avaya media gateways provide a variety of flexible deployment 
options. These options include 100% Internet Protocol (IP) environments and blended 
environments such as IP and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM).
Avaya media gateways have the following benefits:
●Interoperable with standards-based data networks
●Stackable, modular, and configurable component solutions
●Can provide redundant equipment and capabilities
●Can provide distributed networking
●Compatible with cabinets in traditional Avaya systems

Overview

Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Two categories of media gateways
There are two categories of media gateways:
●Those that use media modules to connect to endpoints and trunks. These media gateways 
are usually used at branch and smaller locations and include:
- G700 Media Gateway
- G350 Media Gateway
- G250 Media Gateway
- G150 Media Gateway
●Those that use circuit packs to connect to endpoints and trunks. These media gateways 
are usually used at central and large locations, and include:
- G600 Media Gateway
- G650 Media Gateway
- CMC1 Media Gateway
- SCC1 Media Gateway
- MCC1 Media Gateway
Carriers
Most media gateways that use circuit packs may also be further classified by carrier type. A 
carrier holds a row of circuit packs and connects them to power, the TDM bus, and the packet 
bus. There are five types:
- A control carrier that contains the processor circuit pack(s). The DEFINITY Server CSI 
used one CMC1 Media Gateway of this carrier type, and the DEFINITY Server SI uses 
one SCC1 Media Gateway of this carrier type because control carriers are required to 
house the DEFINITY processor circuit packs.
- A duplicated control carrier that also contains the processor circuit pack(s). This type of 
carrier is an option of the SCC1 Media Gateway and is used for the DEFINITY SI server 
only.
- A port carrier that contains various port circuit packs and does not contain a processor. 
The G600 and G650 Media Gateways are exclusively of this carrier type. The CMC1 and 
SCC1 Media Gateways may also be of this type. The MCC1 Media Gateway can 
simultaneously house this type of carrier along with other carrier types.
- An expansion control carrier that contains an IPSI or tone clock circuit pack and a 
maintenance circuit pack. This type of carrier is an option when using expansion port 
networks with a DEFINITY SI server. This carrier is also used in all SCC1 and MCC1 
Media Gateways for connections to the server or to other media gateways in an S8500 or 
S8700-series media server configuration.

Avaya media gateways
Issue 4

- A switch node carrier that holds switch node interface cards to allow an S8700 media 
server to use the center stage switch configuration. Only the S8700 media server can 
support a center stage switch configuration and switch node carriers are one type of 
carrier that can be simultaneously housed in an MCC1 media gateway.
The following media gateways all contain only one carrier:
●G600 media gateway
●G650 media gateway
●CMC1 media gateway
●SCC1 media gateway
The MCC1 media gateway contains multiple, up to five, carriers.
Common architectural aspects of media gateways for central 
locations
A media gateway consists of the following architectural components:
●TDM bus. The TDM bus has 512 time slots. The TDM bus runs internally throughout each 
media gateway and terminates on each end. The TDM bus consists of two 8-bit parallel 
buses, bus A and bus B. Bus A and bus B carry circuit-switched digitized voice and data 
signals. Bus A and Bus B can also carry control signals to all port circuits and between port 
circuits and the SPE. The port circuits place digitized voice signals and data signals on a 
TDM bus. Bus A and bus B are usually active simultaneously. However, only one bus is 
active at any one time for control signaling.
●Packet bus. The packet bus runs internally throughout each media gateway and 
terminates on each end. The packet bus carries logical links and control messages from 
the SPE. The links and messages are carried through port circuits, to endpoints such as 
terminals and adjuncts. The packet bus carries logical links for both on-switch and 
off-switch control between some specific port circuits in the system. These circuits include, 
for example, IPSI, expansion interface, and IP Media Resource 320 circuit packs, control 
D-channels, and remote management terminals.
●Port circuits. The port circuits form analog or digital interfaces between the media 
gateway and external trunks and linking devices. These linking devices provide links 
between the gateway and external trunk and the TDM bus and the packet bus. Incoming 
analog signals are converted to pulse-code modulated (PCM) digital signals and placed on 
the TDM bus by port circuits. Port circuits convert outgoing signals from PCM to analog for 
external analog devices. All port circuits connect to the TDM bus. Only specific ports 
connect to the packet bus.

Overview
28
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
●Interface circuits. Interface circuits allow the media server to: 
- communicate with the media gateways
- connect two or more media gateways together
- connect port networks together via switch nodes
Interface circuits with traditional server architectures use optical fiber for the connections. 
The S8500 Media Server and S8700 Media Server architectures also use optical fiber for 
connecting media gateways together. But they also use Ethernet connections from the 
servers to the connected media gateways. The S8300 Media Server uses Ethernet 
connections exclusively to connect to the media gateways.
●Service circuits. For traditional servers, S8500 Media Servers, and S8700 Media 
Servers, service circuits provide tone production and detection, call classification, 
recorded announcements, and speech synthesis. The S8300 Media Server uses built-in 
service circuits in the G250, G350, and G700 Media Gateways.
Port networks
The architectures for DEFINITY servers, the S8500 Media Server, and the S8700 Media Server 
use an entity called a port network (PN). A PN uses combinations of media gateways to provide 
physical ports and interfaces for handling calls. A port network can be one of the following:
●One single-carrier media gateway: G600, G650, CMC1, or SCC1
●A stack of single-carrier media gateways that are connected with a TDM bus cable and 
share connections to the media server or port circuit packs
●An individual carrier or a set of TDM cable-connected carriers housed within the MCC1 
media gateway
Note:
Note:
The G700, G350, and G250 Media Gateways are controlled by a Communication 
Manager Media Server via H.248 and are not considered port networks, however 
they may reside within a configurations including port networks.
A port network for a DEFINITY server is one of two types:
●A processor port network (PPN)
A PPN consists of at least one gateway, or carrier in the case of an MCC1 gateway. The 
PPN houses the carrier that contains the DEFINITY Server, which is the main call 
processor. The DEFINITY Server controls any other gateways or carriers in the PPN stack. 
The call processor is connected through the TDM cable connections. A communications 
system has only one PPN. 

Port networks
Issue 4
June 2005
29
 
●An expansion port network (EPN)
An EPN is another gateway or gateway stack that is connected to the PPN using fiber links, 
DS1 links, ATM links, or IP links. An EPN has its own tone clock and power. It may also 
have its own maintenance circuit pack or can share a maintenance circuit pack with another 
PN in the same stack. But the DEFINITY Server in the PPN otherwise controls the EPN. 
EPNs are optional and usually expand the number of port connections, especially remote 
connections.
A port network for an S8500 or S8700 Media Server is always an EPN because the call 
processor resides in the media server, not in a gateway or port network. As a result, the term 
"port network" (PN) is sufficient to describe the gateway or gateway stack with an S8500 or 
S8700 Media Server.
Center Stage Switch
For the S8700, an MCC1 media gateway can also contain a center-stage switch (CSS), which 
allows fiber link connections to 44 PNs. In this case, the MCC1 is equipped with a Switch Node 
carrier. The Switch Node carrier contains one or more Switch Node Interface (SNI) circuit packs 
that allow fiber links between the MCC1 Media Gateway and the PNs. The MCC1 Media 
Gateway that houses the CSS may also contain one or more PNs. 
An S8700-series Media Server can support from one to three CSSs simultaneously. Each CSS 
contains a single switch node carrier for a system with a single fiber-connected bearer network. 
Each CSS contains two switch node carriers for a system with a duplicated fiber-connect bearer 
network.

- Maintenance software
An S8300 Media Server has a dual maintenance strategy. Maintenance software runs on 
both the media gateway platform and the S8300 Media Server for subsystems on the 
platform. This platform software performs initialization and motherboard maintenance, 
along with internal environmental monitoring.
In contrast, the media gateway registers with the S8300 Media Server. Then, media 
modules are tested and brought into service by the S8300 Media Server’s maintenance 
software. The media gateway’s maintenance software is aware of its own media 
modules. However, the S8300 Media Server controls these modules and their associated 
ports. The S8300 Media Server also maintains error logs.
- Linux Red Hat operating system
- Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server
- Secure HTTP server for IP phone file downloads
- H.248 Media Gateway Signaling Protocol
- Control messages tunneled over H.323 Signaling Protocol
●Capacities
- 900 ports by a combination of trunks and stations
●450 IP station, 450 non-IP stations, or a combination of 450 IP and non-IP stations
●450 trunks
- 50 G700/G350/G250 Media Gateways
S8300 Media Server in an LSP configuration
An S8300 Media Server in a Local Survivable Processor (LSP) configuration uses the S8300 
hardware component and a software license to activate a standby feature. This software allows 
the LSP with a G700/G350/G250 Media Gateway to be a survivable call-processing server for 
remote locations and branch locations. 
The branch locations can have the following Media Servers as their primary controller:
- S8300,
- S8500,
- S8700, or
- S8710.
An S8300 Media Server and the LSP cannot reside in the same G700/G350/G250 Media 
Gateway.

If for any reason communication between a G700/G350/G250 Media Gateway and its primary 
controller stops, an LSP activates. This "fail-over" from the primary controller to the LSP is an 
automatic process without human intervention. The LSP assumes control of any IP telephone 
provided that telephone has the LSP in its list of controllers. 
The LSP can continue to support calls as the primary controller for 30 days. The LSP is in 
"license-error" mode when it is supporting calls. After 30 days in license-error mode, the LSP 
administration is blocked and display telephones show License Error in their display windows. 
However, even after 30 days, telephone operations can continue.
Automatic fallback to primary controller
Based on administration of Communication Manager, the G700/G350/G250 LSP can return 
control of the G700/G350/G250 Media Gateway to the primary controller (server) automatically 
when the connection is restored between the media gateway and the primary controller. By 
returning control of the media gateways to the primary controller automatically, Communication 
Manager software easily and quickly eliminates the fragmentation between remote gateways in 
the network created by LAN/WAN communication failures with the primary controller.
The G700/G350/G250 Media Gateway preserves stable calls when control changes from the 
LSP to the primary controller. Stable calls are calls that are carrying active two-way or 
multi-party conversations. Other calls such as those that are on hold are not preserved.
Note:
Note:
The fall-back from the LSP to the primary controller may also be manual using a 
reset on the LSP. This reset breaks the communication between the LSP and 
each registered endpoint. This break causes the endpoints to register with the 
primary controller. However, most active calls are preserved.
Number of LSPs supported
The number of LSPs that a configuration can support depends on the controlling media server. 
An S8500 Media Server, S8700 Media Server, or S8710 Media Server can support up to 250 
LSPs. An S8300 Media Server can support up to 50 LSPs.
Translations
An automatic process copies translation changes when customers make changes on the 
primary controller to each LSP.

Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
LSP installation
The hardware for the S8300 Media Server as primary controller is identical to the hardware for 
the S8300 Media Server as LSP. The difference between the two configurations is entirely in 
software. Therefore, the hardware installation is identical for both configurations. 
Note:
Note:
 An S8300 Media Server and the LSP cannot reside in the same G700 Media 
Gateway.
IP addressing of the primary controller, the LSP, and IP telephones
An LSP is administered with a different IP address than the IP address of the primary controller. 
In addition, IP telephones obtain their own IP address from a DHCP server. The DHCP server 
also sends a list of controllers, LSPs, and their associated IP addresses. The IP telephone then 
registers with the controller corresponding to the first IP address in this list. When connectivity is 
lost between the controller and the endpoint, the endpoint registers with the second IP address 
in the list, and so on. This list can be administered for telephones on the DHCP server.
Survivability
The survivability of the S8300 Media Server is enhanced using the following options:
●S8300 Media Server in an LSP mode
●UPS or power backup
●Ram disk
S8300 Media Server in an LSP mode
The LSP is located in the G700 Media Gateway and provides survivability when the S8300 
Media Server is inaccessible. Each S8300 Media Server can have up to 50 LSPs. The LSP has 
a copy of the customer translations for the S8300 Media Server. For details, see S8300 Media 
Server in an LSP configuration on page 38.
UPS or power backup
For the S8300 Media Server, any of the available UPS units can instantly supply power during a 
power outage. See Avaya UPS Units on page 413.

RAM disk
RAM disk is a portion of memory used as a disk partition. In the event of a hard disk failure, the 
S8300 Media Server uses only RAM disk to provide call processing for up to 72 hours. 
Administration and backups are prohibited. Also, IA770 INTUITY AUDIX Messaging is 
unavailable during a hard disk failure, so secondary call coverage points for users should be 
administered, even with RAM disk enabled.
High-level capabilities
The following table presents a subset of high-level capabilities for the S8300 Media Server. For 
more detailed system capacity information refer to the Capacities Table for Avaya

Adjuncts
This section describes adjunct support that is unique to the S8300 Media Server. For a more 
complete list of adjuncts that the S8300 Media Server supports, see Adjuncts on page 32.
IA770 INTUITY AUDIX Messaging
IA770 INTUITY AUDIX messaging is an optional voice mail system used with an S8300 Media 
Server. IA770 INTUITY AUDIX messaging is a software-only version of INTUITY AUDIX 
messaging that uses a QSIG-MWI H.323 virtual trunk for communication between the 
Communication Manager and IA770 software. This version is available on the G700, G350, and 
G250 Media Gateway configurations. Without the need for additional hardware, IA770 INTUITY 
AUDIX software processes touchtones, converts messages to the G.711 format, and converts 
text to speech. 
Note:
Note:
For upgrades only, a G700 or G350 Media Gateway that previously used a 
CWY1 board continue to use the CWY1 board with IA770 INTUITY AUDIX 
software. However, the CWY1 board is no longer available for new systems.
The IA770 INTUITY AUDIX system can be a solution for one location in a stand-alone S8300 
configuration. The system can also be networked with other voice mail systems using TCP/IP 
and Avaya Message Networking.
Highlights of an IA770:
●Supports up to 450 local users for typical call volumes and usage and up to 300 local users 
for heavy call volumes and usage
●Up to 60,000 remote messaging subscribers, with up to 50 hours of storage for recorded 
names and announcements.
●INTUITY AUDIX interface for telephone users
●Up to 450 Message Manager clients
●Up to 16 Message Manager simultaneous sessions, and four when using text-to-speech
●35 different languages are available for prompts
●Backup of translations and messages over LAN and WAN
●Message storage of up to 30 minutes for each mailbox and 85 total hours for messages 
and greetings
Note:
Note:
The actual number of hours of storage available for messages and greetings can 
be higher if fewer than 60,000 subscriber names are recorded. Each recorded 
name requires approximately 3 seconds of storage.

Resources shared with the S8300 Media Server
An IA770 uses many resources of the S8300 Media Server and the media gateway where it 
resides. The following list outlines the S8300’s shared resources used by the IA770 INTUITY 
AUDIX system:
●Hardware for data storage and retrieval
●TFTP server for:
- Downloading and updating the license file for feature activation
- Backing up and restoring data over a LAN or a WAN, including translations and 
messages
- Updating and upgrading software 
●IP address for administration access
●General Alarm Manager for alarm display
●Web interface to start and stop the system
The IA770 system also shares the same switch-tone parameters established for the S8300 
Media Server. With the software-only version of the IA770 system that is currently sold, the 
S8300 Media Server handles switch tones on behalf of the IA770 system and passes on the 
control information to the IA770 system using QSIG signaling. With the IA770 system that uses 
a CWY1 board, the installer or administrator must set IA770 parameters to match those of the 
S8300 Media Server.
Call center
An S8300 Media Server provides an excellent solution for a small call center. An S8300 Media 
Server supports up to 250 call center agents with a G700 Media Gateway and up to 10 call 
center agents with a G350 Media Gateway. The S8300 also offers the following call-center 
capabilities:
●A maximum of 16 ASAI links
●Announcement software
Printers
The S8300 Media Server is connected to the customer's LAN. Therefore, you can send print 
requests to any printer within the LAN and IP region of the S8300 Media Server.
A system printer is supported when a terminal server is used. In this case, the printer is 
connected to an adjunct PC such as a CDR system, CMS, or Call Accounting System.
A journal printer is supported when a terminal server is used.

Avaya S8500 Media Server
Overview
The Avaya S8500 Media Server is a rack mounted telephony server. The S8500 runs the Linux 
operating System, and features Communication Manager, the Avaya world class call 
processing application. The S8500 can support Internet Protocol (IP), Session Initiation 
Protocol (SIP), and traditional endpoints. This tri-level support enables new technology and 
eases migration from legacy Avaya systems. The S8500 Media Server is a perfect solution for 
mid-sized customers, with growth of up to 3200 ports.
There are actually two S8500 models, the S8500 and the S8500B. While their functionality is 
basically the same, the S8500 and S8500B Media Servers have slightly different hardware 
components. 
An S8500 Media Server configuration has the following components:
●S8500 Media Server on page 48 or S8500B Media Server on page 54
●Media gateways for main locations on page 227, which individually or as stacks serve as 
port networks and include one or more of the following types:
- Avaya G650 Media Gateway (default for new systems) on page 230, which is always 
sold with new systems
- G600 Media Gateway on page 227, with a migration system only
- CMC1 Media Gateway on page 237, with a migration system only
- SCC1 Media Gateway on page 242, with a migration system only
- MCC1 Media Gateway on page 253, with a migration system only
Note:
Note:
The Avaya G700 Media Gateway on page 213, the Avaya G350 Media 
Gateway on page 203, the Avaya G250 Media Gateway on page 193, and the 
G150 Media Gateway on page 181 are supported through the C-LAN circuit 
pack. The C-LAN circuit pack can be mounted in any of the gateways previously 
listed.
Note:
Note:
Media Gateway types cannot be mixed within the same port network (PN).
●TN2312BP IP server interface on page 312, which provides control signaling from the 
media server to the port networks (PNs). At least one PN in a fiber-connected 
configuration must contain a TN2312BP circuit pack. In an IP-connect configuration, each 
PN must contain one TN2312BP circuit pack.

Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
●TN2302AP IP media processor on page 310 or TN2602AP IP Media Resource 320 on 
page 321, which provides TDM-to-IP conversions of audio signals. At least one of these 
circuit packs is required in each PN that uses the IP-connect connection method to the 
media server.
●One Ethernet switch for single control reliability. The switch is one of the following types:
- Avaya C360 Ethernet Switches on page 427 (for new installations and migrations)

Note:
Note:
The S8500 Media Server monitors the health of the RSA and generates an alarm 
if a failure condition is detected.
RSA power
The RSA obtains power from an external power source using its own built-in transformer. Or the 
RSA obtains power from the S8500 Media Server through its connection at the PCI bus. Avaya 
recommends that an external power source on a different circuit from the S8500 be provided for 
the RSA. In this way, if the RSA’s power fails, the S8500 can provide backup power. 
For external power, plug the cord from the power-supply adapter into the power connector on 
the RSA. For domestic installations a 3 pronged power cord is plugged from the power-supply 
adapter into the power source. For international installations a power cord with a male IEC320 
connector is used. The RSA can only be plugged into a AC power source. A power LED on the 
RSA lights when either or both of the following conditions are met:
●The RSA is receiving power from the external power-supply adapter.
●The RSA is receiving power from the S8500 Media Server in which it is installed.
Modems
The S8500 Media Server is equipped with two modems for remote alarming. One modem 
connects to the USB port on the front of the S8500 Media Server and is used for 
Communication Manager alarms. The other modem connects to the RS232 port on the RSA 
and is used for S8500 O/S and environmental alarms. The RSA modem provides remote 
access to allow diagnostics for the S8500. Both modems are connected to the same analog 
trunk, and the S8500 Media Server’s modem answers calls first if the S8500 is operational. See 
Figure 7: Modem connectivity to the S8500 on page 53 for an example of modem connectivity 
to the S8500 Media Server. 
Note:
Note:
Avaya recommends that an external power source on a different circuit from the 
S8500 be provided for the RSA. You may not be able to access the RSA in the 
case of a power failure if the RSA and the S8500 Media Server receive power 
from the same power supply.

●Two USB ports on the front and two USB ports on the back. One of the four ports is used 
for the Compact Flash drive.
Note:
Note:
The SAMP card also has USB ports that are in addition to the four specified on 
the S8500B itself. The Compact Flash drive is always connected to a USB port 
on the S8500B chassis, not on the SAMP card.
●One serial port can be used for console redirection
●A keyboard port (not used)
●A mouse port (not used)
●Two 10/100/1000Base-T Ethernet ports
●A Server Availability Management Processor (SAMP) card for maintenance
●An external Compact Flash Memory Reader
●A Compact Flash 128 MB industry media (optional)
●One USB modem
●AC-powered
●Includes RAM disk.
Note:
Note:
An optional dual-NIC card can be added to the configuration when the network 
control is sent over a dedicated LAN.
Server Availability Management Processor (SAMP) 
The SAMP card is a Remote Maintenance Board (RMB) that is preinstalled in the S8500B 
Media Server. The SAMP card provides remote maintenance and serviceability to the media 
server.
Similar in functionality to the RSA card, the SAMP card provides the following functionality:
●Monitors the server state of health: fans, voltages, and temperature
●Reports server failure and other alarms to INADS by modem
●Provides remote server power-on and reset capability
●Secure dial-in connection to the SAMP, and subsequently the host, using SSH, secure 
shell
●Services laptop access to the SAMP, and subsequently the host)
Power to the SAMP is derived from an external power source. This power source uses its own 
built-in transformer or receives power from the S8500B Media Server through its connection at 
the PCI bus. Avaya recommends that an external power source on a different circuit from the 
S8500B be provided for the SAMP. In this way, if the SAMP’s power fails, the S8500B can 
provide backup power.

Modem
The S8500B Media Server is equipped with one modem for remote alarming. The modem 
connects to the USB port on the SAMP. The S8500B Media Server, through its internal Ethernet 
port connection to the SAMP, can also use the modem, either for alarming or for remote access. 
As a result, the single modem of the S8500B Media Server is used for remote access for 
S8500B diagnostics, O/S and environmental alarms, and Communication Manager alarms. 
Remote access to the SAMP through the modem uses port 10022, and remote access to 
Communication Manager through the modem uses port 22. See Figure 10: Modem 
connectivity to the S8500B on page 57 for an example of modem connectivity to the S8500B 
Media Server.

Backing up an S8500 Media Server
You can backup the S8500 Media Server to a server on the LAN or to the Compact Flash 
memory reader. This reader is installed in one of the USB ports. The Compact Flash memory 
reader uses a 128-MB Compact Flash card. Avaya recommends that use of the industrial grade 
Compact Flash for the following reasons:
●Improved data integrity and reliability
- Powerful error correction
●Extreme endurance
- 2,000,000 program/erase cycles per block
●Increased reliability
- Mean time between failures (MTBF) greater than 3 million hours
●Industry-leading 7-year warranty
●Enhanced durability
- New RTV silicone for added strength and stability
The industrial grade Compact Flash is available through Avaya and Avaya business partners.
Connectivity
Note:
Note:
This section, including the Media Gateway subsections that follow, applies to 
both the S8500 and S8500B Media Servers.
The S8500 Media Server supports the following methods of port network connections:
●S8500 IP-connect (single control network) on page 83
●S8500 direct-connect (single control network) on page 86
In addition, a single MCC1 cabinet can be configured to house multiple PNs that use the 
IP-connect configuration. See the Example of MCC1 IP-Connect PNs on page 148.
Using both IP- and direct-connect PNs in a configuration
An S8500 Media Server’s IP-connect configuration can be combined with the direct-connect 
configuration.
For more information, see Configurations with both IP-connect and fiber-connected PNs on 
page 130.

Survivability
Note:
Note:
This section applies to both the S8500 and S8500B Media Servers.
Recovery capability is embedded in the Communication Manager software that resides on the 
S8500 Media Server. Thus, the S8500 Media Server can use the following recovery options:
●RAM disk on page 59
●Servers, port networks, and gateways that an S8500 ESS supports on page 60
●S8300 Media Server in an LSP mode on page 60
RAM disk
RAM disk is a portion of memory used as a disk partition. In the event of a hard disk failure, the 
S8500 Media Server uses only RAM disk to provide call processing for up to 72 hours. 
Administration and backups are prohibited.
S8500 Media Server as an Enterprise Survivable Server
A Communication Manager configuration may use the S8500 Media Server as an Enterprise 
Survivable Server (ESS). The ESS option provides survivability to a configuration by allowing 
backup servers to be placed in various locations in the customer’s network. An ESS assumes 
call processing control of all or part of the configuration in case the main server, either an S8500 
or S8700-series Media Server, fails or network connections to the main server fail. 
A main server may have many, up to 63, ESSs available to provide backup service. The 
placement of the ESS or ESSs in the configuration is typically targeted at ensuring that port 
networks that are configured in different segments of the customer’s LAN/WAN can receive 
service even when LAN/WAN connections are lost.
Once the communication failure to the main server has been corrected, control of call 
processing may be returned from the ESS to the main server either manually port network by 
port network or automatically for all port networks at once.
Note:
Note:
In the transition of control from the main server to an ESS, all calls are dropped 
while the media gateways carrying the calls reset to connect to the ESS.

60
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Servers, port networks, and gateways that an S8500 ESS supports
An S8500 Media Server may serve as the ESS for either an S8500 or an S8700-series main 
server. If the main server is a S8500 Media Server, any and all ESS servers in the configuration 
must also be S8500 Media Servers. If the main server is an S8700-series Media Server with a 
duplicated control network or both duplicated control and bearer networks, the S8500 ESS can 
maintain the duplication when it takes call processing control from the main server. To support 
duplication, an S8500 ESS must also contain a dual-NIC card.
Note:
Note:
An ESS may support a G150, G250, G350, or G700 Media Gateway through the 
C-LAN connection of the ESS-connected port network. 
Note:
Note:
An S8500 Media Server, as a main server, does not support a duplicated control 
network. Additionally, if the main server is an S8500 Media Server, any ESS that 
supports the main server must also be an S8500 Media Server.
An ESS can support CSS-connected or ATM-connected port networks, as well as IP-connect 
port networks, in the main server’s configuration. However, the ESS normally uses the 
customer LAN, and therefore IP-connect port network connectivity, to provide both backup 
control and bearer traffic when the main server connection is lost. 
Requirements to support CSS- and ATM-connected port networks
Each CSS-connected port network that is to receive ESS service must also contain a 
TN2312BP IPSI circuit pack and TN570 Expansion Interface circuit packs with vintage D or 
higher. Vintage D of the TN570 allows the TN570 to appropriately share control from the server 
with the IPSI. To be survivable, any CSS-connected port networks must have an IPSI to get 
service from an ESS and a TN2302AP IP Media Processor or a TN2602AP IP Media Resource 
320 to have port network connectivity to the other PNs. A PN without an IPSI will lose service 
when the main server connection fails. 
Each ATM-connect port network that is to receive ESS service must also contain TN2305 or 
TN2306 ATM Interface circuit packs with vintage B or higher. Vintage B of the TN2305/2306 
allows the TN2305/2306 to appropriately share control by the server with the IPSI. Any 
ATM-connected port network that does not have an IPSI may still receive service if the port 
network maintains its connection to the ATM switch and the ATM switch still communicates with 
one or more IPSI-controlled port networks.
For more information about ESS setup, operation, or feature functionality, see Avaya Enterprise 
Survivable Servers (ESS) User Guide, 03-300428.
S8300 Media Server in an LSP mode
The LSP is located in the G700 Media Gateway and provides survivability when the S8500 
Media Server is inaccessible. Each S8500 Media Server can have up to 50 LSPs. The LSP has 
a copy of the S8500 Media Server customer translations. For details, see S8300 Media Server 
in an LSP configuration on page 38.

Power outages
In most cases, an Avaya solution can recover from a power outage or other failure instantly, 
regardless of the source of the failure. Each PN includes a set of segmented, parallel buses. If 
one of the paired segments fails, the other bus segment continues to handle communications. 
The UPS units supply power to the control complex.
Migrating to an S8500 Media Server
Note:
Note:
This section applies to both the S8500 and S8500B Media Servers.

Avaya S8700-series Media Servers 
Overview
The Avaya S8700-series (S8700 and S8710) media servers use a standard microprocessor 
engine with either a Pentium 3 (S8700) or a Pentium 4 (S8710) processor on a commercial 
server. Different manufacturers provide the S8710 Media Server and the S8700 Media Server. 
However, the S8710 has similar internal components and the same functionality as the S8700 
Media Server. Both the S8700 and the S8710 Media Servers support Communication Manager. 
The S8710 Media Server is the server usually shipped for new systems.
The S8700-series media servers use high-speed connections to route voice, data, and video 
between the following trunks and lines:
●analog and digital trunks
●data lines that are connected to host computers, data-entry terminals, personal computers, 
and internet addresses
The S8700-series media servers use a Linux platform on an Intel-based server. The 
S8700-series media servers are derived from the DEFINITY processor. But the S8700 has 
fewer physical components, and provides most of the same features and functionality with 
increased capacity.
Configuration information
Both the S8700 and S8710 Media Servers support two types of port network configurations, or 
a combination of both:
●Voice bearer over IP (IP-Connect): An all-IP configuration that carries both control and 
bearer information.
●Voice bearer over fiber connections (Multi-Connect) with direct-connect expansion 
interface circuit packs, Center Stage Switch (CSS), or Asynchronous Transfer Mode 
(ATM).
In fiber-connected configurations, the bearer paths and control paths are separate. The 
control information for port networks travels over a control network. The control information 
terminates on the S8700 or S8710 Media Server at one end and an IP Server Interface 
(IPSI) circuit pack on the other. The control network can be of one of the following networks:
- A dedicated control network in which an Ethernet switch is used only for the control 
network and therefore creates a private LAN
- A nondedicated control network in which control data passes through an Ethernet switch 
that is also connected to the customer LAN

66
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
S8700-series media server control complex
Both configurations, voice bearer over IP and voice bearer over direct-connect, CSS or ATM, 
use the following components and software:
●Two media servers. See either S8700 Media Server on page 67 or S8710 Media 
Server on page 70.
Note:
Note:
Both media servers must be of the same type, either S8700 or S8710 Media 
Servers. You cannot have a server pair with an S8700 and an S8710 Media 
Server.
●Media gateways for main locations on page 227, which individually or as stacks serve as 
port networks and include one or more of the following types:
- Avaya G650 Media Gateway (default for new systems) on page 230, which is always 
sold with new systems
- G600 Media Gateway on page 227, with a migration system only
- CMC1 Media Gateway on page 237, with a migration system only
- SCC1 Media Gateway on page 242, with a migration system only
- MCC1 Media Gateway on page 253, with a migration system only

Gateway on page 203, the Avaya G250 Media Gateway on page 193, and the 
G150 Media Gateway on page 181 are supported through the C-LAN circuit 
pack. The C-LAN circuit pack can be mounted in any of the gateways previously 
listed.
Note:
Note:
Media Gateway types cannot be mixed within the same port network (PN).
●TN2312BP IP server interface on page 312, which provides control signaling from the 
media server to the port networks (PNs). At least one PN in a fiber-connected 
configuration must contain a TN2312BP circuit pack. In an IP-connect configuration, each 
PN must contain one or two TN2312BP circuit packs.
●TN2302AP IP media processor on page 310 or TN2602AP IP Media Resource 320 on 
page 321, which provides TDM-to-IP conversions of audio signals. At least one of these 
circuit packs is required in each PN that uses the IP-connect connection method to the 
media server.

S8710 Media Server
Note:
Note:
For a description of the S8700 Media Server hardware, see S8700 Media 
Server on page 67.
The S8710 server’s dimensions are (HxWxD) 3.38 in. (8.6 cm.) x 17.50 in. (44.5 cm.) x 25.75 in. 
(65.4 cm.). The S8710 Media Server has a 2U form factor.
Characteristics of the S8710 Media Server include:
●3.06 GHz P4 processor
●512 MB memory
●72GB 10,000 RPM SCSI hard disk drive
●2 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports on the motherboard to support IPSI network control links, 
services access, and administration
●Two USB ports, one of which you use for a modem connection and the other to connect 
the Compact Flash drive
●External (USB) Compact Flash
●4-port (10/100BaseT) network interface card (quad NIC)
●A SCSI CD/DVD-ROM
●A DAL1 Duplication board for connections to the duplicated server. 
A DAL1 board resides in a PCI slot on both the active server and the standby server. The 
DAL1 operates in either active or standby mode to match the mode of its server. The active 
server saves data to its DAL1 board. Then, the data is also sent over the fiber link to the 
DAL1 board on the standby server.
●A distance limitation of 10 km between the S8710 Media Servers in the pair
●Support for global power ranges from 100V to 250V AC
●Active/standby status LED for easy in rack server identification
●Transport, using Communication Manager and an appropriate media processor (T2302AP 
or TN2602AP), of the following messages:
- Fax, Teletypewriter device (TTY), and modem calls over a corporate IP intranet using 
pass-through mode
- Fax and TTY calls using proprietary relay mode
!
SECURITY ALERT:
SECURITY ALERT:

Determining the number of IPSIs required based on PNs
For configurations where voice bearer is over IP, there must be one IPSI in each PN.
For a direct connect configuration, a single IPSI is installed in only one of the PNs, and this IPSI 
controls the other PNs.
For configurations where voice bearer is over CSS or ATM, each IPSI usually controls up to five 
port networks. The IPSI tunnels control messages over the bearer network to PNs that do not 
have IPSIs. 
Note:
Note:
An IPSI cannot be placed in:
-
A PN that has a Stratum-3 clock interface
-
A Survivable Remote Expansion Port Network (SREPN)
To determine the number of IPSIs that are recommended for a specified number of PNs in an 
S8700 or S8710 bearer-over-ATM-or CSS configuration, do the following procedures:

For standard duplex CSS or ATM configurations
1. Divide the number of PNs by 5.
2. Round the dividend from Step 1 up to the nearest whole number.
3. Add one to the whole number from Step 2.
The result from Step 3 is the required number of IPSIs. 
For example, with nine port networks, you divide nine by five, which results in 1.8. Then, you 
round 1.8 up to 2 and add 1, which results in 3. Thus, 3 IPSIs are required.
The IPSI added in the previous Step 3 provides fault tolerance and is placed in a PN that does 
not already have an IPSI.
For high and critical reliability CSS or ATM configurations
4. Divide the number PNs by 5.
5. Round the dividend from Step 1 up to the nearest whole number.
6. Multiply the whole number from Step 2 by 2.
The result from Step 3 is the required number of IPSIs.
For example, with nine port networks, you divide nine by five, which results in 1.8. Then, you 
round 1.8 up to 2 and multiply by 2, which results in 4. Thus, 4 IPSIs are required. These 4 
IPSIs are installed as a pair of IPSIs in each of two IPSI-connected PNs.Thus, fault tolerance is 
doubled in high- or critical-reliability configurations.
For more information on the IP Server Interface, see TN2312BP IP server interface on 
page 312.
Ethernet switch 
An Ethernet switch provides connectivity between the servers and the IPSI circuit packs that 
reside in some PNs. For duplex reliability, one Ethernet switch is provided. For high and critical 
reliability, the Ethernet switches are duplicated. An S8700-series media server supports two 
Ethernet connections to the Ethernet switch in the control network.
An S8700-series media server usually uses an Avaya Ethernet switch as part of the control 
complex. The Avaya Ethernet switch extends Ethernet connectivity to the PN where the switch 
connects to an IPSI. One Ethernet switch is required for duplex reliability. Two are required for 
high or critical reliability of voice bearer over CSS or ATM only. If desired, customer-provided 
non-Avaya Ethernet switches can be substituted for Avaya Ethernet switches.
The control network for an S8700-series media server does not have to be a dedicated one. 
However, an installation that uses a dedicated set of Ethernet switches provides simplicity and 
greater reliability.

74
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
UPS or power backup
Power backup for an S8700-series media server is highly desirable. Power backup avoids 
power problems and ensures that the system processes shutdown gracefully if the power fails. 
The Avaya 1000-VA UPS provides approximately 30 minutes of power backup. Combinations of 
battery extension modules and a 1500-VA UPS provide up to eight hours of power backup. See 
Avaya UPS Units on page 413.
The Avaya UPS units send SNMP traps to the S8700/S8710 Media Server when power fails. 
The server’s Global Maintenance Manager can then send an alarm to the services organization 
or send a trap to a network management system. When a separate 48V-DC battery string is 
used, it might be possible to send an alarm when voltage is below a threshold. However, 
shutdown will not be mechanized.
USB modem
Each S8700-series media server in a server pair requires a Universal Serial Bus (USB) modem 
for maintenance access and to call out an alarm. The modems can share a common phone line 
if the media servers are colocated. When the media servers are separated an additional phone 
line is required. The online server answers incoming calls. The callers can access the offline 
server by means of a telnet session. Each modem connects to a USB port on the media server. 
The USB modems used must conform to the Communication Device Class (CDC) specification, 
and usually to the Abstract Control Model (ACM) subclass. A modem will not work with the 
media server driver if the modem does not comply with the specifications.
Reliability
Reliability for IP-connect 
The S8700/S8710 Media Server supports the following reliability configurations with IP-connect 
port network configurations:
●Standard reliability
Standard reliability includes duplicated S8700-series servers. When the active server fails, 
an automatic interchange occurs, and standby server assumes call processing control. 
During the interchange, most IP phone calls continue. All other calls are dropped.
For more information, see S8700-series IP-connect (single control network) on page 90.
●High reliability
High reliability includes duplicated control networks and duplicated servers. The servers are 
each connected to two Ethernet switches, which are in turn connected to the customer LAN. 

Avaya S8700-series Media Servers
Issue 4
June 2005
75
 
In each IP-connect port network, two separateTN2312BP IPSI circuit packs are also 
connected to the customer LAN. If the control connection through one Ethernet switch fails 
or the connection to one IPSI fails, the other Ethernet switch and IPSI complete the 
connection to the server.
For more information, see S8700-series IP-connect (duplicated control network) on 
page 93.
Reliability when sending voice bearer over direct-connect, ATM, or CSS
The S8700/S8710 Media Server supports the following reliability configurations with 
direct-connect, CSS, or ATM port network configurations:
●Standard reliability
Standard reliability includes duplicated S8700-series servers. When the active server fails, 
an automatic interchange occurs, and standby server assumes call processing control. 
During the interchange, most IP phone calls continue. All other calls are dropped.
For more information, see one of the following:
- S8700-series direct-connect (single control network) on page 95
- S8700-series Center Stage Switch (single control network) on page 104
- S8700-series ATM Switch (single control network) on page 114
●High reliability
High reliability includes duplicated control networks and duplicated servers. The servers are 
each connected to two Ethernet switches. These Ethernet switches are normally each 
connected to the IPSI-connected port networks. Two separateTN2312BP IPSI circuit packs 
in each IPSI-connected PN is connected to one of the Ethernet switches. If the control 
connection through one Ethernet switch fails or the connection to one IPSI fails, the other 
Ethernet switch and IPSI complete the connection to the server.
For more information, see one of the following:
- S8700-series direct-connect (duplicated control network) on page 98
- S8700-series Center Stage Switch (duplicated control network) on page 108
- S8700-series ATM Switch (duplicated control networks) on page 119
●Critical reliability
Critical reliability includes duplicated servers, duplicated control networks, and duplicated 
bearer networks. In addition to the control duplication of the high reliability option, fiber 
connections between port networks are duplicated. For direct-connect configurations, 
TN570 Expansion Interface connections are duplicated. For CSS configurations, each CSS 
node has two switch node carriers, such that switch node interfaces are duplicated. For 
ATM configurations, the ATM switches are duplicated.

76
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
For more information, see one of the following:
- S8700-series direct-connect (duplicated control and bearer networks) on page 100
- S8700-series Center Stage Switch (duplicated control and bearer networks) on page 111
- S8700-series ATM Switch (duplicated control and bearer networks) on page 122
Multiple reliabilities among PNs
The port networks that are connected together with fiber in direct-connect, CSS, and ATM 
configurations must all share the same reliability level. However, when IP-connect port networks 
are added to a configuration that includes fiber-connected port networks, the IP-connect port 
networks may have a different reliability level. Additionally, IP-connect port networks in the 
same Communication Manager configuration can have different reliability levels.
For more information, see Options for multiple levels of reliability on page 133.
Connectivity
The S8700/S8710 Media Server supports the following methods of port network connections:

Connectivity when sending voice bearer over IP
The following connection methods are available with IP-connect configurations:
●S8700-series IP-connect (single control network) on page 90
●S8700-series IP-connect (duplicated control network) on page 93
In addition, a single MCC1 cabinet can be configured to house multiple PNs that use the voice 
bearer over IP configuration. See the Example of MCC1 IP-Connect PNs on page 148.
Note:
Note:
When using IP-connect connectivity between PNs, video cannot be sent directly 
between port networks. In this case, video calls must be routed through the public 
network and back into the media server’s network.
Combining IP- and fiber-connected port networks
An S8700-series Media Server supports only one type of configuration from the list of available 
direct-connect, CSS, or ATM configurations. However, the two IP-connect configurations can be 
mixed together, and either or both of the IP-connect configurations can be mixed with any one 
of the direct-connect, CSS, or ATM configurations.
For more information, see Configurations with both IP-connect and fiber-connected PNs on 
page 130.
Survivability
In addition to the high reliability of the duplicated S8700 or S8710 Media Servers, recovery 
capability is embedded in the Communication Manager software that resides on the S8700 or 
S8710 Media Server. Thus, the S8700 or S8710 Media Server can use the following recovery 
options:
●S8700-series Media Server as an Enterprise Survivable Server on page 77
●S8300 Media Server in an LSP mode on page 79
S8700-series Media Server as an Enterprise Survivable Server
A Communication Manager configuration may use the S8700-series Media Server as an 
Enterprise Survivable Server (ESS). The ESS option provides survivability to a configuration by 
allowing backup servers to be placed in various locations in the customer’s network. An ESS 
assumes call processing control of all or part of the configuration in case the main server, 
another S8700-series Media Server, fails or network connections to the main server fail. 

78
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
A main server may have many, up to 63, ESSs available to provide backup service. The 
placement of the ESS or ESSs in the configuration is typically targeted at ensuring that port 
networks that are configured in different segments of the customer’s LAN/WAN can receive 
service even when LAN/WAN connections are lost.
Once the communication failure to the main server has been corrected, control of call 
processing may be returned from the ESS to the main server either manually port network by 
port network or automatically for all port networks at once.
Note:
Note:
In the transition of control from the main server to an ESS, all calls are dropped 
while the media gateways carrying the calls reset to connect to the ESS.
Servers, port networks, and gateways that an S8700 ESS supports
An S8700-series Media Server may serve as the ESS for an S8700-series main server only. If 
the main server is a S8500 Media Server, any and all ESS servers in the configuration must 
also be S8500 Media Servers. If the main server is an S8700-series Media Server with a 
duplicated control network and duplicated bearer network, the S8700 ESS can maintain the 
duplication when it takes call processing control from the main server. 
Note:
Note:
An ESS may support a G150, G250, G350, or G700 Media Gateway through the 
C-LAN connection of the ESS-connected port network. 
An ESS can support CSS-connected or ATM-connected port networks, as well as IP-connect 
port networks, in the main server’s configuration. However, the ESS normally uses the 
customer LAN, and therefore IP-connect port network connectivity, to provide both backup 
control and bearer traffic when the main server connection is lost. 
Requirements to support CSS- and ATM-connected port networks
Each CSS-connected port network that is to receive ESS service must also contain a 
TN2312BP IPSI circuit pack and TN570 Expansion Interface circuit packs with vintage D or 
higher. Vintage D of the TN570 allows the TN570 to appropriately share control from the server 
with the IPSI. To be survivable, any CSS-connected port networks must have an IPSI to get 
service from an ESS and a TN2302AP IP Media Processor or a TN2602AP IP Media Resource 
320 to have port network connectivity to the other PNs. A PN without an IPSI will lose service 
when the main server connection fails. 
Each ATM-connect port network that is to receive ESS service must also contain TN2305 or 
TN2306 ATM Interface circuit packs with vintage B or higher. Vintage B of the TN2305/2306 
allows the TN2305/2306 to appropriately share control by the server with the IPSI. Any 
ATM-connected port network that does not have an IPSI may still receive service if the port 
network maintains its connection to the ATM switch and the ATM switch still communicates with 
one or more IPSI-controlled port networks.
For more information about ESS setup, operation, or feature functionality, see Avaya Enterprise 
Survivable Servers (ESS) User Guide, 03-300428.

S8300 Media Server in an LSP mode
The LSP is located in the G700 Media Gateway and provides survivability when the S8700/
S8710 Media Server is inaccessible. Each S8700/S8710 Media Server can have up to 50 LSPs. 
The LSP has a copy of the S8700/S8710 Media Server customer translations. For details, see 
S8300 Media Server in an LSP configuration on page 38.
Power outages
In most cases, an Avaya solution can recover from a power outage or other failure instantly, 
regardless of the source of the failure. Each PN includes a set of segmented, parallel buses. If 
one of the paired segments fails, the other bus segment continues to handle communications. 
The UPS units supply power to the control complex.

Note:
Note:
Any configuration that includes IP Solutions applications such as Road Warrior, 
Telecommuter, or H.322 trunking, has an impact on the BHCCs and processor 
capacity. If a customer uses these applications in a high traffic solution, we 
recommend that the Avaya Technology and Consulting (ATAC) team reviews any 
potential impact on traffic.
The information in this table represents the maximum number of calls the S8700/S8710 Media 
Server can execute. These numbers assume the Media Server is unconstrained by other 
factors such as:
●TDM bus limitations
●Call duration
●Small number of telephones
We assume processor occupancy of 0.90, at which various delay criteria such as cut through is 
preserved. This occupancy is just at the threshold where calls can no longer be processed.

Port network configurations with S8500 and S8700-series 
Media Servers
The S8500 and S8700-series Media Servers can control call processing of port networks in a 
large variety of ways. Control networks can be established using Ethernet connections only or a 
combination of Ethernet connections and fiber connections (direct-connect, CSS, or ATM). 
Voice, fax, TTY, and modem transmission can occur over the LAN/WAN connections, fiber 
connections, or both. Reliability with the S8700-series Media Server can include single control 
and bearer networks (standard reliability), duplicated control networks (high reliability), 
duplicated control and bearer networks (critical reliability), or a combination of reliabilities.
Each of the following configurations show how the various options can be used. Configurations 
with both IP-connect and fiber-connected PNs on page 130 describes the possibilities and 
considerations when fiber-connected options are combined with IP-connect options.
S8500 IP-connect (single control network)
In this configuration, the S8500 Media Server uses IP connections to both control call 
processing on the port networks (PNs) and to send voice between PNs over an IP network. An 
existing VOIP-ready IP infrastructure can be used. This solution saves customers the cost of 
building a separate telephony network. In this type of configuration, all PNs are connected to the 
server and to each other over the customer’s network. Up to 64 PNs can be configured in an 
IP-connect network. Depending on the type of Ethernet switches used to connect PNs, the 
number of PNs, and the PN locations in the LAN and WAN, the network may require multiple 
Ethernet switches to support the PNs.
Only the G650 media gateway is available for new installations. However, because different 
migrations from older systems are supported, the following media gateways can be used in an 
IP-connect network:
●G650 media gateway
A G650 PN can consist of one to five G650 gateways in a stack connected by a TDM/LAN 
bus cable (see Avaya G650 Media Gateway (default for new systems) on page 230). One 
gateway, serving as control gateway in position A at the bottom of the stack, contains the 
following:
- TN2312BP IPSI circuit pack
●G600 media gateway
A PN can consist of one to four G600 gateways in a stack connected by a TDM/LAN bus 
cable (see G600 Media Gateway on page 227). One gateway, serving as control gateway in 
position A at the bottom of the stack, contains the following:
- TN2312AP/BP IPSI circuit pack

Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Note:
Note:
The TN2314 Processor and TN744E Call Classifier and Tone Detector circuit 
packs, needed for the S8100 model, are not used and must be removed if the 
G600 is being migrated from an S8100 Media Server. All gateways are port 
gateways, though the bottom gateway (serving as control cabinet A) contains the 
IPSI circuit pack. 
●CMC1 media gateway
A PN can consist of one to three CMC1 gateways in a stack connected by a TDM/LAN bus 
cable (see CMC1 Media Gateway on page 237). One gateway, serving as control gateway 
in position A at the bottom of the stack, contains the following:
- TN2312AP/BP IPSI circuit pack
Note:
Note:
The TN795 processor board, needed for the CSI model, is not used and must be 
removed if the CMC1 is being migrated from a DEFINITY server. The CMC1 or 
CMC1 stack may not be used with additional PNs. 
IP/TDM conversion resource - Each PN must contain at least one TN2302AP IP Media 
Interface or TN2602AP IP Media Resource 320 circuit pack. The TN2302AP or TN2602AP 
circuit pack provides IP-TDM voice processing of endpoint connections between PNs. These 
circuit packs may be inserted in any gateway in the PN. Each PN may optionally house a 
TN799DP C-LAN circuit pack for control of the G150 Media Gateway, the H.248 media 
gateways (G700, G350, G250), IP endpoints, adjunct systems such as messaging, and 
firmware downloads. 
Ethernet connections. - In the IP-connect configuration, the S8500 Media Server connects to 
the media gateways through a single Ethernet switch. Each PN also has a connection to the 
S8500 Media Server through a local Ethernet switch. As a result, remote PNs in an IP-connect 
configuration over a WAN, which normally requires routers to complete the connection, may 
require their own Ethernet switches, in addition to the Ethernet switch that supports the S8500 
Media Server. IP connections to the S8500 Media Server may be administered as dedicated 
private LAN connections or connections over the customer LAN.

S8500 direct-connect (single control network)
In this configuration, one PN is connected to the server over an Ethernet connection. Fiber links 
connect up to two additional PNs to each other. This configuration also requires either a 
dual-NIC card in the S8500 Media Server or an interim Ethernet switch so that the S8500 Media 
Server can have an Ethernet port to the customer LAN and a dedicated Ethernet connection to 
the media gateways.
IPSI-connected PN
Only the G650 media gateway is available for new installations. However, because different 
migrations from older systems are supported, the PN connected to the S8500 Media Server can 
consist of one of three gateways:
●G650 media gateway
A G650 PN can consist of one to five G650 gateways in a stack connected by a TDM/LAN 
bus cable (see Avaya G650 Media Gateway (default for new systems) on page 230)). One 
gateway, serving as control gateway in position A at the bottom of the stack, contains the 
following:
- TN2312BP IPSI circuit pack
●SCC1 media gateway
An SCC1 PN can consist of one to four SCC1 gateways in a stack connected by a TDM/
LAN bus cable (see SCC1 Media Gateway on page 242). One gateway, serving as control 
gateway in position A at the bottom of the stack, contains the following:
- TN2312AP/BP IPSI circuit pack
4.
PN control gateway in the A position in the gateway stack which contains: 
●A TN2312AP/BP IPSI circuit pack for IP connection to server. 
Note:
Note:
For the G650 Media Gateway, the BP version of the TN2312 is required in order to provide 
environmental maintenance.

Note:
Note:
The TN2404 and TN2401 processor circuit packs, needed for the SI model, are 
not used and must be removed if the SCC1 is being migrated from a DEFINITY 
server. 
●MCC1 media gateway
An MCC1 PN has from one to five carriers in an MCC1 gateway connected by a TDM/LAN 
bus cables (see MCC1 Media Gateway on page 253). One carrier, serving as control carrier 
in position A in the middle of the stack, contains the following:
- TN2312AP/BP IPSI circuit pack
Note:
Note:
The control carrier for a DEFINTY Server SI or R is not used and must be 
removed and replaced with an expansion control carrier if the MCC1 is being 
migrated. The processor circuit packs, needed for the SI or R models, are not 
used and must be removed. Other PNs can also be MCC1 Gateways.
PNs not IPSI-connected
In a S8500 direct-connect configuration, additional PNs (up to two only) may be connected 
using fiber optic cable. The additional PNs connect to the IPSI-connected PN using fiber optic 
cable between external interface (EI) TN570B (version 7 or later) circuit packs. The cables are 
connected to the circuit packs using short-range or long-range multi-mode transceivers, or 
single-mode transceivers, depending on the distance between PNs. 
The TN570B circuit packs reside in the control carrier (MCC1) or control gateway (G650 or 
SCC1) of each PN. The control carrier or gateway in each additional PN also must contain a 
TN2182C Tone Clock circuit pack (SCC1 or MCC1) or a maintenance-only TN2312BP IPSI 
circuit pack (G650). 
Note:
Note:
Straight fiber connections between TN570B circuit packs may be up to 200 feet 
(61 meters) (see TN570B Expansion Interface PN connections up to 200 ft. on 
page 126). If the distance between PNs is greater, Light guide interface units 
(LIUs) must also be used to connect the fiber cables or the connection must use 
TN1654 DS1 converters. Lengths of fiber, including connections through LIUs or 
DS1 converters, are:
-
4900 feet (1493.5 meters) (see TN570B Expansion Interface PN connections up to 
4900/25000 ft. and 22 miles. on page 127)
-
25,000 feet (7620 meters) in multimode (see TN570B Expansion Interface PN 
connections up to 4900/25000 ft. and 22 miles. on page 127)
-
21.7 miles (34.9 kilometers) in single mode (see TN570B Expansion Interface PN 
connections up to 4900/25000 ft. and 22 miles. on page 127)
-
200 miles (322 kilometers) (see TN1654 DS1 Converter/TN570B Expansion 
Interface PN connections up to 200 miles. on page 129)

Note:
Note:
You cannot connect additional PNs that contain CMC1 or G600 Media Gateways.
Rules for TN570B circuit pack placement with SCC1/MCC1 
Media Gateways
Fiber-connected MCC1 and SCC1 Media Gateways have rules on the placement of TN570B 
External Interface circuit packs in direct connect configurations. See Rules for TN570B circuit 
pack placement with SCC1/MCC1 Media Gateways on page 102. However, for MCC1/SCC1 
Media Gateways configured with an S8500 Media Server, only the rules that apply to single 
control networks apply.

S8700-series IP-connect (single control network)
In this configuration, the S8700-series Media Servers connect to one PN or multiple PNs over 
an Ethernet connection using either an interim Ethernet switch and a dedicated LAN connection 
or the customer’s LAN. Each PN is connected to the Ethernet switch or LAN with a CAT5 cable 
to a TN2312AP/BP IP Server Interface (IPSI) card. 
This solution saves customers the cost of building a separate telephony network. In this type of 
configuration, all PNs are connected to the customer’s network and call control from the 
S8700-series Media Server is also sent over the customer’s network. Up to 64 PNs can be 
configured in an IP-connect network. 
Only the G650 media gateway is available for new installations. However, because different 
migrations from older systems are supported, the following media gateways can be used in an 
IP-connect network:
●G650 media gateway
A G650 PN can consist of one to five G650 gateways in a stack connected by a TDM/LAN 
bus cable (see Avaya G650 Media Gateway (default for new systems) on page 230). One 
gateway, serving as control gateway in position A at the bottom of the stack, contains the 
following:
- TN2312BP IPSI circuit pack
6.
PN control gateway or carrier, which contains two TN570B EI circuit packs for bearer and control network connections to 
the other two PNs.
NOTE: One TN2182C Tone Clock circuit pack must also be present per PN if the PN(s) consist of SCC1 or MCC1 
Media Gateways. One maintenance-only TN2312BP IPSI circuit pack must be present per PN if the PN(s) consist of 
G650 Media Gateways.
The control gateway or carrier is always in the A position in the MCC1 or gateway stack.

S8700-series direct-connect (single control network)
In this configuration, one PN is connected to the server over an Ethernet connection. Fiber links 
connect up to two additional PNs to each other. This configuration also requires either a 
dual-NIC card in the S8700-series Media Server or an interim Ethernet switch.
IPSI-connected PN
Only the G650 media gateway is available for new installations. However, because different 
migrations from older systems are supported, the PN connected to the S8700-series Media 
Server can consist of one of three gateways:
●G650 media gateway
A G650 PN can consist of one to five G650 gateways in a stack connected by a TDM/LAN 
bus cable (see Avaya G650 Media Gateway (default for new systems) on page 230)). One 
gateway, serving as control gateway in position A at the bottom of the stack, contains the 
following:
- TN2312BP IPSI circuit pack
●SCC1 media gateway
An SCC1 PN can consist of one to four SCC1 gateways in a stack connected by a TDM/
LAN bus cable (see SCC1 Media Gateway on page 242). One gateway, serving as control 
gateway in position A at the bottom of the stack, contains the following:
- TN2312AP/BP IPSI circuit pack
Note:
Note:
The TN2404 and TN2401 processor circuit packs, needed for the SI model, are 
not used and must be removed if the SCC1 is being migrated from a DEFINITY 
server. 
5.
Duplicated expansion control gateway, in the B position, which contains: 
●A TN2312AP/BP IPSI circuit pack for IP connection to control network.
6.

7.
LAN connections of TN2302AP IP Media Interface or TN2602AP IP Media Resource 320 for IP-TDM voice processing and 
optional TN799DP C-LAN for control of IP endpoints
NOTE: The number of TN2302AP, TN2602AP, and TN799DP circuit packs varies, depending on the number of IP 
endpoints, PNs, and adjunct systems. These circuit packs may be inserted into a port carrier (shown in figure), the 
PN control carrier, or the duplicated control carrier.

●MCC1 media gateway
An MCC1 PN has from one to five carriers in an MCC1 gateway connected by a TDM/LAN 
bus cables (see MCC1 Media Gateway on page 253). One carrier, serving as control carrier 
in position A in the middle of the stack, contains the following:
- TN2312AP/BP IPSI circuit pack
Note:
Note:
The control carrier for a DEFINTY Server SI or R is not used and must be 
removed and replaced with an expansion control carrier if the MCC1 is being 
migrated. The processor circuit packs, needed for the SI or R models, are not 
used and must be removed. Other PNs can also be MCC1 Gateways.
PNs not IPSI-connected
In a S8700-series Media Server direct connect configuration, additional PNs (up to two only) 
may be connected to the IPSI-connected PN using fiber optic cable between external interface 
(EI) TN570B (version 7 or later) circuit packs. The cables are connected to the circuit packs 
using short-range or long-range multi-mode transceivers, or single-mode transceivers, 
depending on the distance between PNs. 
The TN570B circuit packs reside in the control carrier (MCC1) or control gateway (G650 or 
SCC1) of each PN. The control carrier or gateway in each additional PN also must contain a 
TN2182 Tone Clock circuit pack (SCC1 or MCC1) or a maintenance-only TN2312ABP IPSI 
circuit pack (G650).
Note:
Note:
Straight fiber connections between TN570B circuit packs may be up to 200 feet 
(61 meters) (see TN570B Expansion Interface PN connections up to 200 ft. on 
page 126). If the distance between PNs is greater, Light guide interface units 
(LIUs) must also be used to connect the fiber cables or the connection must use 
TN1654 DS1 converters. Lengths of fiber, including connections through LIUs or 
DS1 converters, are:
-
4900 feet (1493.5 meters) (see TN570B Expansion Interface PN connections up to 
4900/25000 ft. and 22 miles. on page 127)
-
25,000 feet (7620 meters) in multimode (see TN570B Expansion Interface PN 
connections up to 4900/25000 ft. and 22 miles. on page 127)
-
21.7 miles (34.9 kilometers) in single mode (see TN570B Expansion Interface PN 
connections up to 4900/25000 ft. and 22 miles. on page 127)
-
200 miles (322 kilometers) (see TN1654 DS1 Converter/TN570B Expansion 
Interface PN connections up to 200 miles. on page 129)
Note:
Note:
You cannot connect additional PNs that contain CMC1 or G600 Media Gateways.

S8700-series direct-connect (duplicated control network)
For high reliability in a direct-connect configuration, the control network is duplicated. This 
configuration is basically the same as that of the single control network configuration, except 
that a second carrier or gateway is added in the B position to provide a second IPSI connection 
to the servers. In this case, the normally-active server is connected to the control carrier/
gateway IPSI circuit pack, and the standby server is connected to the second carrier/gateway 
IPSI circuit pack. See S8700-series direct-connect duplicated control network on page 99.
All other connections between the PNs are the same.

S8700-series direct-connect (duplicated control and bearer 
networks)
For critical reliability in a direct-connect configuration, both the control network and bearer 
network are duplicated. This configuration is basically the same as the duplicated-control- 
network-only (high reliability) configuration, except that a second carrier or gateway is added in 
each additional PN with optic fiber link connections to the second carrier or gateway of the 
IPSI-connect PN. See S8700-series direct-connect duplicated control network and duplicated 
voice-bearer network on page 101.
All other connections between the PNs are the same as those of the 
duplicated-control-network-only configuration.

With a single and duplicated control network
For a direct connect configuration with a single (standard reliability) or duplicated control (high 
reliability) network, the placement rules are as follows:
●The IPSI-connected PN houses up to two TN570B circuit packs, the first in the A01 slot 
and the second in the A02 slot. These circuit packs connect to the TN570B circuit packs 
residing in the A01 slots only of the non-IPSI-connected PNs (up to two).
●With three PNs in the direct connect configuration, the non-IPSI-connected PNs connect 
over fiber to each other with a TN570B circuit pack that resides in the A02 slot in each PN.
With duplicated bearer network
For a direct connect configuration with duplicated control and a duplicated bearer (critical 
reliability) network, the rules for a single/duplicated control network still apply. In addition, the 
following rules apply for the TN570B circuit packs in the B cabinets/carriers:
●The IPSI-connected PN houses up to two TN570B circuit packs in the duplicated control 
cabinet/carrier, the first in the B02 slot and the second in the B03 slot. These circuit packs 
connect to the TN570B circuit packs residing in the B02 slots only of the 
non-IPSI-connected PNs (up to two).
●With three PNs in the direct connect configuration, the non-IPSI-connected PNs connect 
over fiber to each other with a TN570B circuit pack that resides in the B03 slot in each PN.
The following table illustrates the exact TN570B-to-TN570B connections and the required 
placement of the TN570B circuit packs in the PNs.

Implications for migrations from DEFINITY R and SI Servers - In a migration from a 
DEFINITY Server R or SI to an S8700-series Media Server with a single or duplicated control 
network, one of the port networks in the new configuration must have either one or two IPSIs 
installed in the PN for connections to the server. It is recommended that the IPSI be installed in 
the converted processor port network (PPN) of the DEFINITY system because the TN570B 
fiber connections can remain as they were prior to the migration. If the IPSI is installed in a 
converted EPN instead, the fiber connections between the TN570Bs must be changed. Table 5 
illustrates the necessary changes, assuming that PN1 represents the converted PPN. 
Likewise, if the migrated configuration includes a duplicated bearer network, the 
recommendation to install the IPSIs in the converted PPN becomes even more compelling, If 
the PPN does not become the IPSI-connected PN, then changes to fiber connections between 
the TN570Bs are necessary in both the A and B positions.
Note:
Note:
The G650 Media Gateway does not restrict where the TN570B EI circuit packs 
are placed, except that they cannot be inserted into the A01 and B01 slots.
S8700-series Center Stage Switch (single control network)
The Center Stage Switch (CSS) is an MCC1 Media Gateway that contains a switch node carrier 
(SNC) in the bottom E position (see Switch node carrier (J58890SA) on page 264). The SNC, in 
turn, houses TN573B switch node interface (SNI) circuit packs, which connect to PNs over optic 
fiber cable to TN570B EI circuit packs in the PNs. A single SNC allows 15 PNs to be connected 
with fiber to the IPSI-connected PN. In large configurations, a second or third MCC1 may be 
equipped with an SNC. The SNC expansion of port networks, therefore, is as follows:
●One SN can expand to up to 15 PNs.
●Two SNs can expand to up to 29 PNs.
●Three SNs can expand to up to 44 PNs.
Note:
Note:
The fiber link connections in an S8700 CSS configuration follow the same 
distance rules as those of the S8700 direct-connect configurations.
A single IPSI circuit pack allows the server to control up to 5 PNs only. Therefore, in a 
configuration with many PNs, multiple PNs may be IPSI-connected. See Determining the 
number of IPSIs required based on PNs on page 72.

Port network configurations with S8500 and S8700-series Media Servers

PN configurations
The MCC1 Media Gateway with a CSS is a IPSI-connected PN that also houses an SNC. 
However, the MCC1 as a CSS can also be configured to house only the SNC, with no control or 
port carriers. In this case, the MCC1 connects to a IPSI-connected PN using the 
SNI-to-TN570B fiber connection. Therefore, in a CSS configuration, the PNs can be any of the 
following:. 
●MCC1 Media Gateway
IPSI-connected. An MCC1 PN (see MCC1 Media Gateway on page 253) that is connected 
to the server has the same configuration as that of a IPSI-connected PN in a direct-connect 
with duplex-servers-only configuration. 
However, if the MCC1 PN also contains an SNC, the IPSI-connected expansion control 
carrier of the MCC1 must also be connected to the SNC with optic fiber from a TN570B 
circuit pack. Also, only 4 carriers are then available for control and port circuit packs. 
Non-IPSI-connected. An MCC1 PN that is not connected directly to the server has the 
same configuration as that of an additional MCC1 PN in a direct-connect with single control 
network configuration. 
●G650 media gateway 
IPSI-connected. A G650 PN can consist of one or more G650 gateways (see Avaya G650 
Media Gateway (default for new systems) on page 230) in a stack (up to 5 in a stack 
connected by TDM/LAN bus cables). A G650 PN that is connected to the server has the 
same configuration as that of a IPSI-connected PN in a direct-connect with single control 
network configuration. 
Not IPSI-connected. A G650 PN that is not connected directly to the server but is 
connected to the SNC has the same configuration as that of an additional G650 PN in a 
direct-connect with single control network configuration. 
●SCC1 media gateway
IPSI-connected. An SCC1 PN can consist of one or more SCC1 gateways (see SCC1 
Media Gateway on page 242) in a stack (up to 4 in stack connected by TDM/LAN bus 
cables). An SCC1 PN that is connected to the server has the same configuration as that of 
a IPSI-connected PN in a direct-connect with single control network configuration. 
Not IPSI-connected. An SCC1 PN that is not connected directly to the server but is 
connected to the SNC has the same configuration as that of an additional SCC1 PN in a 
direct-connect with single control network configuration. 
Note:
Note:
With the S8700-series Media Server, the SNC is not connected to the other 
carriers in the MCC1 cabinet with TDM/LAN bus cables.
In the following example, 5 PNs, one of which is embedded in the MCC1 with the CSS, requires 
two IPSIs.

S8700-series Center Stage Switch (duplicated control network)
For high reliability in a CSS configuration, the control network is duplicated. This configuration is 
basically the same as that of the single control network configuration, except that a second 
carrier or gateway is added in the B position of each IPSI-connected PN to provide a second 
IPSI connection to the servers. In addition, this configuration contains duplicated Ethernet 
switches, each connected to both S8700-series Media Servers. 
Note:
Note:
With the S8700-series Media Server, the SNC is not connected to the other 
carriers in the MCC1 cabinet with TDM/LAN bus cables.
IPSI-connected PNs
Because a single IPSI circuit pack allows the server to control up to 5 PNs only. a configuration 
with many PNs and duplicated control networks can require many IPSI circuit packs.See 
Determining the number of IPSIs required based on PNs on page 72.

S8700-series Center Stage Switch (duplicated control and bearer 
networks)
Like the high reliability CSS configuration, the critical reliability CSS configuration duplicates the 
control network between the servers and the PNs. In addition, this configuration contains 
duplicated switch node carriers in each CSS, which duplicates the bearer network between 
PNs. Each PN, in turn, contains duplicated TN570B external interface circuit packs that connect 
to both switch node carriers. In addition, each non-IPSI-connected PN must have duplicate 
TN2182CTone Clock circuit packs. And finally, in each location of a PN or group of PNs, one of 
the PNs must have a TN771 Maintenance Test circuit pack.
Note:
Note:
With the S8700-series Media Server, the SNCs are not connected to the other 
carriers in the MCC1 cabinet with TDM/LAN bus cables.

S8700-series ATM Switch (single control network)
An S8700-series Media Server can support up to 64 PNs by using Asynchronous Transmission 
Mode (ATM) switching for PN connections. Each PN in the configuration must have a TN2305B 
ATM interface circuit pack (for multimode fiber) or a TN2306B ATM interface circuit pack (for 
single-mode fiber) in order to connect to every other PN in the system. The PNs can be MCC1, 
SCC1, or G650 Media Gateways (or gateway stacks). At least one PN is IPSI-connected to the 
S8700-series Media Servers. The ATM switch connects to the fiber with an OC-3 interface. 
Note:
Note:
The ATM configuration illustrations show multi-mode fiber connections using 
TN2305B ATM-CES circuit packs and multi-mode fiber. With single-mode fiber 
connections, the configurations are the same, but the ATM connections uses 
TN2306B ATM-CES circuit packs and single-mode fiber.
A single IPSI circuit pack allows the server to control up to 5 PNs only. Therefore, in a 
configuration with many PNs, multiple PNs may be IPSI-connected. See Determining the 
number of IPSIs required based on PNs on page 72.

IPSI-connected PN
Only the G650 media gateway is available for new installations. However, because different 
migrations from older systems are supported, the PN connected to the S8700-series Media 
Server in an ATM configuration can consist of one of three gateways:
●G650 media gateway
A G650 PN can consist of one to five G650 gateways in a stack connected by a TDM/LAN 
bus cable (see Avaya G650 Media Gateway (default for new systems) on page 230). One 
gateway, serving as control gateway in position A at the bottom of the stack, contains the 
following:
- TN2312BP IPSI circuit pack
- TN2305B or TN2306B ATM-CES circuit pack for bearer and control network connections 
to the ATM switch
- TN464GP DS-1 circuit pack for clock synchronization with a network resource
●SCC1 media gateway
An SCC1 PN can consist of one to four SCC1 gateways in a stack connected by a TDM/
LAN bus cable (see SCC1 Media Gateway on page 242). One gateway, serving as control 
gateway in position A at the bottom of the stack, contains the following:
- TN2312AP/BP IPSI circuit pack
- TN2305B or TN2306B ATM-CES circuit pack for bearer and control network connections 
to the ATM switch
- TN464GP DS-1 circuit pack for clock synchronization with a network resource
The control gateway or another gateway in the PN also contains a TN464GP DS-1 circuit 
pack for clock synchronization with a network resource
Note:
Note:
The TN2404 and TN2401 processor circuit packs, needed for the SI model, are 
not used and must be removed if the SCC1 is being migrated from a DEFINITY 
server. 
●MCC1 media gateway
An MCC1 PN has from one to five carriers in an MCC1 gateway connected by a TDM/LAN 
bus cables (see MCC1 Media Gateway on page 253). One carrier, serving as control carrier 
in position A in the middle of the stack, contains the following:
- TN2312AP/BP IPSI circuit pack
- TN2305B or TN2306B ATM-CES circuit pack for bearer and control network connections 
to the ATM switch
The control carrier or another carrier in the PN also contains a TN464GP DS-1 circuit pack 
for clock synchronization with a network resource

116
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Note:
Note:
The control carrier for a DEFINTY Server SI or R is not used and must be 
removed and replaced with an expansion control carrier if the MCC1 is being 
migrated. The processor circuit packs, needed for the SI or R models, are not 
used and must be removed. Other PNs can also be MCC1 Gateways.
PNs not IPSI-connected
In an ATM switch with a single control network configuration, additional PNs (up to 64) may be 
connected to the IPSI-connected PN using fiber optic cable between TN2305B/TN2306B 
ATM-CES circuit packs and an ATM switch. The cables are connected to the circuit packs using 
short-range or long-range multi-mode transceivers, or single-mode transceivers, depending on 
the distance between PNs. 
The TN2305B/2306B ATM-CES circuit packs reside in the control carrier (MCC1) or control 
gateway (G650 or SCC1) of each PN. The control carrier or gateway in each additional PN also 
must contain a TN2182 Tone Clock circuit pack (SCC1 or MCC1) or a maintenance-only 
TN2312BP IPSI circuit pack (G650).

S8700-series ATM Switch (duplicated control networks)
The high reliability ATM configuration duplicates the control network between the servers and 
the PNs. This configuration contains duplicated Ethernet switches, each connected to both 
S8700-series Media Servers. Remote IPSI-connected PNs also require duplicated Ethernet 
switches. However, IPSI-connected PNs that are collocated with the servers may share 
Ethernet switches with the server. The high reliability configuration also includes duplicated 
IPSIs in a second carrier or gateway of the IPSI-connected PN. In an ATM high reliability 
configuration, the n + 1 formula for IPSIs is not required.

S8700-series ATM Switch (duplicated control and bearer 
networks)
Like the high reliability ATM configuration, the critical reliability ATM configuration duplicates the 
control network between the servers and the PNs. In addition, the critical reliability configuration 
contains duplicated ATM switches and ATM connections, with each PN containing duplicated 
TN2305B/TN2306B ATM-CES circuit packs with connections to both ATM switches. In addition, 
each non-IPSI-connected PN must have duplicate TN2182CTone Clock circuit packs. And 
finally, in each location of a PN or group of PNs, one of the PNs must have a TN771 
Maintenance Test circuit pack.
As with an ATM high reliability configuration, the n + 1 formula for IPSIs is not required.

Distance options with fiber-optic connections
Fiber connections up to 200 feet (61 meters)
EI-to-EI or EI-to-SNI intercabinet connections are implemented by installing a lightwave 
transceiver on the I/O connector plate for each of the administered fiber endpoints. Each 
lightwave transceiver has a receive and a transmit connector for either a 62.5-micron or 
50-micron fiber connection. Standard fibers are available in various lengths up to 150 feet 
(46 m) for single-mode fiber and up to 200 feet (61 m) for multimode fiber. These fibers are 
used to connect lightwave transceivers to each other when they are close enough together, or 
to optical cross-connect facilities for greater distances.

When fiber-optic cabling is not practical, Digital Service 1 (DS1) can be used to connect PNs up 
to 200 miles (322 km) apart. A TN574 or TN1654 DS1 Converter (DS1 CONV) circuit pack 
serves as the interface between the network and an EI or SNI on the switch. DS1 cabling on a 
carrier consists of a Y-cable that connects a DS1 CONV to an EI or SNI and to the network.

Table 1 lists the lengths and uses for DS1 CONV cables, depending upon where the DS1 
CONV and the EI or SNI are located.
The DS1 CONV to EI/SNI cable is a shielded metallic Y-cable held in place at the EI/SNI port 
connector by a 4B retainer and at the DS1 CONV port connector by a 4C retainer. The cable 
end with one 25-pair amphenol connector attaches to the I/O Plate connector for the EI or SNI. 
The end with two 25-pair amphenol connectors attaches to the DS1 CONV I/O plate connector.
The 13-inch (33-centimeter) cable 846448652 or 847245776 connects the DS1 CONV to a 
fiber-optic cable, enabling the DS1 CONV to connect to an EI or SNI at a greater distance. The 
cable end with one 25-pair amphenol connector attaches to a lightwave transceiver using the 
846885259 bracket. The end with two 25-pair amphenol connectors attaches to the DS1 CONV 
I/O plate connector. The other end of the fiber-optic cable connects to a lightwave transceiver 
attached to the I/O plate connector of the EI or SNI.
An H600-348 cable connects the DS1 CONV cable to a CSU (channel service unit), which 
connects to a wall field. Alternatively, connection is sometimes made directly from the Y-cable to 
the wall field. This cable provides from one to four DS1 connections. One end of the H600-348 
cable is plugged into the 50-pin amphenol piggy-back connector on the 8464486xx cable 
connected to the DS1 CONV port connector. The other end of the H600-348 cable has four 
15-pin sub-miniature D-type connectors that plug into the CSU. Table 2 lists the H600-348 cable 
specifications.

Configurations with both IP-connect and fiber-connected 
PNs
Communication Manager R3.0 allows the S8700-series, S8500, and S8500B Media Servers to 
support configurations that combine IP-connect port networks (PNs) with direct-connect PNs, 
CSS-connected PNs or ATM-connected PNs. Additionally, Communication Manager R3.0 
allows the media servers to support configurations that contain both single control networks and 
duplicated control networks and both single IP-connect bearer networks and duplicated 
fiber-connected bearer networks. 
This capability allows customers to do the following:
●Add IP PNs to a fiber-connected configuration using the simpler, less costly connections 
over the customer LAN. In this way, customers can avoid the complication and cost of 
adding fiber-connected PNs. This capability can be especially attractive when it eliminates 
the need for installing a DS1C circuit pack and a connection over a T1 trunk to the new 
PN. 
●Convert and consolidate, in an easy, cost-effective way, remote standalone DEFINITY 
servers (R, SI, CSI, or S8100) and their PNs into a single network of PNs controlled by, 
and administered with, one server.
●Configure, within the single footprint of an MCC1 Media Gateway, multiple port networks, 
using IP-connect PNs, fiber-connected PNs, or a variety of combinations of the two. In this 
way, customers have tremendous flexibility in configuring MCC1 Media Gateways to 
balance reliability, call capacities and feature richness.
●Configure reliability into a network in a more cost-effective, flexible way. Duplication of 
control and bearer networks can be configured based on the criticality of the location or the 
needs of users connected to a particular PN.

Note:
Note:
All port networks that are fiber-connected within a direct-connect, CSS or ATM 
switch configuration must still have the same reliability level — all single control 
and bearer network, all duplicated control network, or all duplicated control and 
bearer network.
Possibilities for combining IP-connect and fiber-connected PNs 
in a configuration
A Communication Manager configuration can contain one of the following combinations of port 
network connection methods:
●IP-connect and direct-connect — available with S8500, S8500B, S8700 or S8710 Media 
Servers as main servers, but not as Enterprise Survivable Servers (ESSs)
●IP-connect and Center Stage Switch (CSS) — available with S8700 or S8710 Media 
Servers as both main servers and ESSs
●IP-connect and Asynchronous Transmission Mode (ATM) — available with S8700 or 
S8710 Media Servers as both main servers and ESSs
Note:
Note:
You cannot mix CSS and ATM port network connections in the same 
configuration. You also cannot mix direct-connect PN connections with ATM or 
CSS port network configurations.
Note:
Note:
The DEFINITY Server CSI does not support multiple port networks and, 
therefore, does not support combining PN connection methods.
Regardless of the combinations of PN connection methods, the maximum number of PNs 
allowed continues to be 64. However, since a server can support IP-connect and CSS PNs 
simultaneously, the following capacity rules apply to a configuration with both IP-connect and 
fiber-connected PNs:
●With CSS, two to 44 CSS PNs, with additional IP-connect PNs for a maximum total of 64 
PNs
●With ATM, 64 ATM and IP-connect PNs in any combination
●With direct-connect, two to three direct-connect PNs, with 1 to 62 IP-connect PNs, for a 
maximum total of 64 PNs

Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Media gateway combinations
Like the G650 Media Gateway, SCC1 and MCC1 Media Gateways can connect to other port 
networks using either IP-connect or fiber-connect options (direct/CSS/ATM-connect). The 
CMC1 and G600 media gateways can be IP-connect only and cannot be fiber-connected in any 
configuration. But, because a server can use the IP-connect method with any of the direct, CSS, 
or ATM connection methods simultaneously, the server can simultaneously connect CMC1s 
and/or G600s as IP-connect media gateways in the same network that includes direct, CSS, or 
ATM-connected G650, SCC1, and/or MCC1 Media Gateways. As a result, a configuration with 
IP-connect and fiber-connected PNs may contain any or all media gateways that are supported 
by the current release of Communication Manager. The following table lists, by server, the 
media gateways and connection methods that the servers can simultaneously support in a port 
network configuration.

Options for multiple levels of reliability 
The reliability options separately available for each PN connection method still apply. For 
example, IP-connect PNs may have duplex server or duplicated control networks, but not 
duplicated bearer networks. However, IP-connect PNs may be mixed with a CSS configuration, 
which can have duplicated bearer networks. Thus, the PNs in a configuration may collectively 
have multiple levels of reliability. Reliability options, and combinations of options, available are 
as follows:
Note:
Note:
Because control network reliability can be mixed, IPSI duplication is administered 
for each individual PN. The system-wide network of PNs does not have to be "all 
duplicated IPSI" or "all simplex IPSI." However, within the fiber-connected portion 
of a system (direct-, CSS, or ATM-connected PNs), where reliability must be 
uniformly applied, IPSI duplication must also be consistent among PNs.

Administering an S8700-series Media Server for duplicated 
and single control networks
With direct/CSS/ATM PN connections and duplicated control networks, an S8700-series Media 
Server’s control network A and control network B interfaces are administered as dedicated 
control networks and connected to duplicated IPSI circuit packs in the fiber-connected PNs. If a 
remote IP-connect PN is introduced into the configuration, the S8700-series Media Server and 
IP-connect PN is administered for a control network over the customer’s LAN. In this case, a 
third control network C may be administered on the S8700-series Media Server. The 
S8700-series Media Server automatically uses its own customer LAN interface port for Control 
network C.Therefore, to administer Control Network C for IP-connect PNs, you only have to tell 
the media server to turn on Control Network C. 
Dedicated and non-dedicated control networks
Control networks A and B can be separately configured for dedicated and non-dedicated control 
networks. You can also use control network C to connect IP-connect PNs, while using control 
networks A and B for dedicated control networks with the fiber-connected PNs. Control network 
C uses the customer LAN exclusively for the control signaling, while control networks A and B 
may use either dedicated Ethernet switch connections or the customer LAN for control 
signaling.
Requirements for using both IP-connect and fiber-connected PNs
A configuration that has both IP-connect and fiber-connected PNs requires the following:
●A Communication Manager license that has IP Port Network Connectivity (IP-PNC) turned 
off (that is the feature keyword in the license file, FEAT_IP_PNC, is off and the IP PNC? 
field on the Customer Options screen is n)
Communication Manager allows IP-connect PNs to be added to an existing fiber-connected 
configuration because IP-PNC is already turned off. 
!
CAUTION:
CAUTION:
If you want to convert or migrate fiber-connected SCC1 or MCC1 PNs to 
IP-connect PNs, the FEAT_IP_PNC keyword must be off. 

Configurations with both IP-connect and fiber-connected PNs
Issue 4
June 2005
135
 
●At least one TN2302AP IP Media Processor or TN2602AP IP Media Resource 320 circuit 
pack in a PN in the fiber-connected PN configuration. 
Since an IP-connect PN does not have fiber connections with the direct, CSS, or ATM PNs, 
bearer transmission between IP-connect PNs and direct/CSS/ATM PNs must occur over the 
IP network. Because they convert TDM calls to IP, and IP calls to TDM, the TN2302AP or 
TN2602AP circuit packs enable bearer transmission over IP networks. The PN or PNs that 
contain the TN2302AP or TN2602AP circuit packs serve as gateways between the 
IP-connect and fiber-connected portions of the configuration.
!
CAUTION:
CAUTION:
The addition of a TN2302AP or TN2602AP circuit pack to a fiber-connected PN 
may have a significant impact on traffic that must be handled by the PN. That is, 
in some scenarios, the PN may not have enough timeslot availability. 
For example, the targets of a large number of IP station or trunk calls may be 
TDM stations or trunks in fiber-connected PNs that do not have TN2302AP/
TN2602AP circuit packs. In this case, the talk paths are routed through a 
gateway PN containing the TN2302AP/TN2602AP circuit packs. This routing may 
unexpectedly exhaust the 484 timeslots of the gateway PN and cause calls to be 
blocked. 
To avoid this linking, TN2302AP/TN2602AP circuit packs should generally be 
placed in every fiber-connected PN. This need becomes more apparent when the 
gateway PN uses a 320-channel TN2602 instead of an 80-channel TN2602. 
As a result, you should analyze the traffic measurements on such PNs prior to 
configuring a PN as a IP-to-TDM gateway.
Note:
Note:
IP-connect PNs always require at least one TN2302AP or TN2602AP circuit 
pack.
Examples of combining IP-connect and fiber-connected PNs 
The following sample configurations illustrate some examples of combining IP-connect and 
fiber-connected PNs. Some examples also illustrate combining different reliability levels.
Example of combining direct- and IP-connect PNs
Figure 31 illustrates an S8500 Media Server configuration that combines direct-connect PNs 
with IP-connect PNs. The IP-connect PN is labeled as item 11. The other PNs, items 3 and 5, 
are direct-connect PNs.

MCC1 Media Gateway with IP-connect PNs or a combination of IP-
and fiber-connected PNs
An MCC1 Media Gateway may contain up to 5 PNs, with each carrier administered as a 
fiber-connected PN. For migrations and conversions only to Communication Manager R3.0, an 
MCC1 can also support from 1 to 5 IP-connect PNs, or both IP-connect and fiber-connected 
PNs. In this way, a combination of PN connection methods may exist on a single MCC1 Media 
Gateway. 
An MCC1 may also contain up to two IP-connect PNs with duplicated control networks. 
However, if a server-connected MCC1 uses duplicated bearer networks with CSS, such that 
switch node carriers must occupy the D and E positions on the MCC1, the MCC1 Media 
Gateway may house up to three PNs, but only one PN can have duplicated control.
The following tables identify the port network configuration options for IP-connect and combined 
IP- and fiber-connected PNs in an MCC1 Media Gateway.

Example of MCC1 with IP- and fiber-connected PNs
Figure 36 illustrates an S8700 Media Server configuration that uses the carriers in an MCC1 
Media Gateway as both fiber-connected and IP-connect PNs. The MCC1 Media Gateway (item 
3) contains two IP-connect PNs (items 5 and 6) with a third CSS-connected PN consisting of a 
single carrier (item 4). With a TN2602AP IP Media Resource 320 or TN2302AP IP Media 
Processor, the CSS-connected PN serves as a gateway between the IP-connect PNs and the 
fiber-connected PNs. Note that the MCC1 Media Gateway also contains a CSS or Switch Node 
Carrier (SNC).

ESS support for combined IP- and fiber-connected PNs
Any Enterprise Survivable Server (ESS) can also support a combined IP- and fiber-connected 
configuration in the event of failover to the ESS. Both an S8500/S8500B and an S8700-series 
ESS can support single control and duplicated control networks for both the IP-connect and 
fiber-connected portions of the configuration, However, the ESSs can support only those CSS- 
or ATM-connected PNs that individually have a TN2312AP/BP IPSI circuit pack and either a 
TN2302AP IP Media Processor or TN2602AP IP Media Resource 320 circuit pack. This 
limitation exists because the ESS provides only IP-connect control and bearer service to PNs.

DEFINITY-based media servers
DEFINITY Server CSI
Overview
Avaya’s Communication Manager on a DEFINITY Server CSI is a solution for a medium-
sized location with 50 to 900 stations. This solution uses DEFINITY TN circuit packs and the 
CMC1 Media Gateway. As a company grows. it is easy and cost-effective for that company to 
migrate from a DEFINITY Server CSI to another Avaya solution. All DEFINITY CSI applications 
and most of the hardware can be reused, so the company’s initial investment is protected.
The DEFINITY Server CSI can be used at a single site or can be networked with other servers 
in multiple locations using DCS and QSIG. For example, DEFINITY Server CSI might provide a 
solution for a satellite office within a larger business or branch locations around the world. 
Multisite companies can use remote diagnostics and alarming to maintain the DEFINITY Server 
CSI from a central location. An administrator can use a system administration tool to administer 
the system from a central location.
A DEFINITY Server CSI consists of the following main components:
●TN2402 processor on page 318
●TN2182C tone clock, tone detector, and call classifier (8 ports) on page 301
●
TN771DP maintenance and test on page 290
●At least one CMC1 Media Gateway on page 237
●Avaya Communication Manager on page 24
DEFINITY Server CSI Port Network Connections
A DEFINITY Server CSI can include up to 3 cabinets in a single PPN: 
●One control cabinet, with a TN2402 processor circuit pack, a TN2182 tone clock circuit 
pack, and a TN771DP maintenance circuit pack
●Up to two expansion gateways connected with a TDM bus cable
The DEFINITY Server CSI does not support expansion port networks (EPNs).
See Typical vertical installation, front view of the CMC1 Media Gateway, DEFINITY Server CSI 
configuration on page 240.

Reliability and recovery
The DEFINITY Server CSI provides the following capabilities for reliability and recovery:
●Can survive minor power surges, including lightning-induced surges up to 2500 volts 
without service interruption. Surge protectors can be purchased for increased coverage.
●Can operate in conditions that include above-average temperatures and above-average 
humidity.
●In case of a power failure, automatically restores the last saved version of the user 
translations and runs the translations when the system restarts.
●Supports the remote diagnostics capability, which enables quick troubleshooting and 
maintenance.
●Conducts self-diagnostics and can self correct many system errors. If further technical 
assistance is required, DEFINITY Server CSI uses an external modem to place a call for 
support.
●Conducts standard maintenance routines automatically.
●Backs up all the user translations each day at midnight by default.
●The single-processor configuration provides 99.9% reliability.

Main components
The DEFINITY Server SI includes the following main components and software:
●One or more media gateways that serve as port networks. See Port network on page 160. 
The port networks can be one of, or a combination of, the following media gateways:
- SCC1, including power supplies for AC power or DC power. For more information, see 
SCC1 Media Gateway on page 242
- MCC1, including power supplies for AC power or DC power. For more information, see 
MCC1 Media Gateway on page 253
●One SCC1 Media Gateway or MCC1 Media Gateway that serves as or contains a 
processor port network. See Processor port network and switch processing element on 
page 160. The PPN contains the following circuit packs:
- TN2402 processor on page 318
- A TN2401/TN2400 network packet interface complex assembly for SI upgrades on 
page 318
- A TN780 tone clock on page 291 or TN2182C tone clock, tone detector, and call 
classifier (8 ports) on page 301
Note:
Note:
A PPN can serve as a stand-alone port network. Or, a PPN can be connected to 
expansion port networks (EPNs), which contain additional ports that increase the 
number of connections to trunks and lines.
●The 631DA1 AC power unit on page 267 and the 631DB1 AC power unit on page 268 for 
AC power.
●The 649A DC power converter on page 268 for DC power
●Avaya Communication Manager on page 24
The following sections describe each of the main components.
Port network
Processor port network and switch processing element
The PPN is an SCC1 Media Gateway that contains the control complex switch processing 
element (SPE). The SPE processes calls on all port interfaces of the system. The control 
complex consists of three circuit packs:
- TN2402 processor on page 318
- A TN2401/TN2400 network packet interface complex assembly for SI upgrades on 
page 318
- A TN780 tone clock on page 291 or TN2182C tone clock, tone detector, and call 
classifier (8 ports) on page 301

All the control circuit packs reside in the control carrier within the PPN. Additional optional circuit 
packs might be needed. Optional circuit packs include the TN799DP C-LAN circuit pack and the 
TN765 Processor Interface. The TN799DP C-LAN circuit pack provides TCP/IP connectivity. 
The TN765 Processor Interface provides BX.25 connectivity. For high reliability and critical 
reliability systems, use the TN792 Duplication Interface circuit pack.
When a telephone goes off-hook or signals call initiation, the SPE receives a signal from the 
port circuit that is connected to the device. The digits of the called number are collected. Then, 
the switch is set up to make a connection between the calling device and the called devices.
The following figure shows a direct-connect system with an SPE in the PPN. Buses route voice 
calls and data calls between external trunks and external lines. EPNs are included in the 
configuration shown.

Options
Expansion Port Network (optional)
An Expansion Port Network (EPN) contains additional ports that increase the number of 
connections to trunks and lines.
IP Media Processor
The IP Media Processor provides voice over internet protocol (VoIP) audio access to the switch 
for local stations and outside trunks. The IP Media Processor provides audio processing for 
between 32 and 64 voice channels. The IP Media Processor supports hairpin connections and 
the shuffling of calls between IP direct connections. The IP Media Processor can perform the 
following functions:
●echo cancellation
●silence suppression
●fax relay service
●DTMF detection. 
The IP Media Processor can be updated using the firmware download feature.
DEFINITY IP Solutions
DEFINITY IP Solutions brings together the flexibility of IP networks with the full feature 
functionality of Communication Manager. IP Solutions provides:
●Investment protection and optimization in IP and public switched telephone networks 
(PSTNs).
●Full software applications, features, and management capabilities.
●Enhanced quality of service
●Full access to Communication Manager features for remote workers.
IP Solutions offers a feature by which users can specify the quality of voice communications. 
With the Quality of Service feature, users can administer and download the Differentiated 
Services Type-of-Service value to optimize voice quality. The Quality of Service feature 
implements buffers in the audio-processing circuit pack to reduce latency and helps some 
routers to prioritize audio traffic.

DEFINITY Server SI

IP Solutions also introduces hairpin connections and IP-IP direct connections. These two 
features make voice communications more efficient. Hairpin connections route the voice 
channel that connects two IP endpoints. Therefore, the voice goes through the IP Media 
Processor circuit pack in IP format and bypasses the TDM bus. IP-IP direct connections route 
the voice channel that connects two IP endpoints. The voice is sent directly through the LAN or 
the WAN between the two endpoints, instead of carrying a mixed connection of IP signaling and 
TDM bus signaling.
The following figure shows the trunk connections and the line connections that are available 
with IP Solutions. The figure also shows how IP Solutions supports connectivity for IP trunks, IP 
softphones, and IP telephones.
Figure 39: IP Solutions
DEFINITY IP Solutions is implemented with the TN2302AP circuit pack, an IP Media Processor 
inside the switch. The TN2302AP IP Media Processor circuit pack provides H.323 trunk 
connections and H.323 voice processing for IP telephones. The features that use the 
TN2302AP IP Media Processor circuit pack also require the TN799 C-LAN circuit pack.
Note:
Note:
The IP trunk that is used in R7 and the current TN2302AP H.323 trunks are not 
interoperable. The TN2302AP H.323 in trunk mode cannot communicate with an 
R7 IP trunk. However, the TN2302AP H.323 trunk can communicate with a 
TN802B circuit pack.

Trunks
DEFINITY IP Solutions supports two trunk configurations:
●H.323 IP trunk (IP Solutions mode)
●IP trunk mode
IP trunks perform the following functions:
●reduce expenses for long distance voice and fax
●provide a full-function network with data and voice convergence
●use available network resources to optimize investments
H.323 IP Trunk (IP Solutions mode)
The TN2302AP IP Media Processor circuit pack supports the H.323 version 2 protocol and 
operates with H.323 version 2 endpoints, including stations, trunks, and gateways. An IP Media 
Processor circuit pack uses IP connectivity between two DEFINITY or other Avaya servers to 
enable H.323 trunk service that uses IP connectivity. H.323 trunk groups can be configured as 
DEFINITY-specific tie trunks that support:
●ISDN trunk features such as DCS+ and QSIG
●Generic tie trunks that permit interconnection with switches from other vendors that are 
compliant with the H.323 version 2 protocol
●Direct inward dial (DID) type of "public" trunks that provide access to the switch for 
unregistered users.
The TN2302AP IP Media Processor circuit pack requires the TN799 CLAN circuit pack for 
signaling.
The TN2302AP IP Media Processor circuit pack is also used for H.323 VoIP applications.
IP Trunk mode
The IP Trunk mode allows trunk groups to be defined as DS1 tie lines between DEFINITY 
systems over a customer’s data network. Each IP Interface circuit pack in IP Trunk mode 
provides a basic 12-port package that can be expanded up to 30 ports.
Each TN802 or TN802B IP Interface Assembly circuit pack in IP Trunk mode requires:
●A connection to a modem
●An incoming line for Avaya remote access
●pcANYWHERE, version 8 or later, to provide direct access to the Windows NT server on 
the hard disk

The TN2302AP IP Media Processor circuit pack does not require:
●A connection to a modem
●An incoming line
●pcANYWHERE to provide direct access to the Windows NT server 
●A TN799B CLAN circuit pack
Connectivity
The following sections describe connectivity of the DEFINITY Server SI and other applications 
over the LAN.
LAN Gateway
The DEFINITY Server SI has an optional J58890MA-1List 2 LAN Gateway circuit pack 
assembly. When this circuit pack assembly is installed, the switch works with communications 
applications that run on personal computers and communicate over the LAN. Therefore, these 
applications can use the CallVisor Adjunct-Switch Application Interface (ASAI).
C-LAN
TCP/IP connectivity is provided over Ethernet or Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to adjuncts such 
as the Call Management System (CMS) or INTUITY AUDIX. TCP/IP connections are also used 
for DCS networking. The TN799DP C-LAN circuit pack provides a "bridge" from the TDM bus to 
the packet bus on a DEFINITY server.
IP Asynchronous Links using the C-LAN circuit pack
The IP Asynchronous Links feature allows the switch to use TCP/IP to transfer existing 
asynchronous adjunct connectivity to an Ethernet network. IP Asynchronous Links is a simple, 
session-layer, proprietary protocol that creates value for the customer in the following ways:
●Reduces the cost to connect the switch to various adjuncts
●Allows for an open architecture to transport information and increases the speed at which 
data is transferred
●Allows customers to manage applications from both onsite locations and remote locations
●Allows for several system management applications to run on a single personal computer 
and thus reduces hardware requirements
●Provides "IP Services" forms to support more flexible administration

166
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
●Guarantees data delivery through a reliable session-layer protocol
●Supports customers’ existing investment in serial hardware through use of Network 
Terminal Servers
IP Asynchronous Links supports switch client applications and server applications as described 
in the following sections.
Switch Client Applications
Client applications with Asynchronous Links allow you to use TCP/IP to connect adjunct 
equipment to the switch through the C-LAN circuit pack.
Asynchronous TCP/IP links connect call detail recording (CDR) devices, property management 
systems (PMS), and printers. Maintenance parameters can be set to allow the switch to report 
alarms over a TCP/IP link.
A device that does not support a direct TCP/IP connection, but does support an RS232 
interface, connects to the C-LAN circuit pack through a terminal server or a router.
Switch Server Applications
IP Asynchronous Links provides a telnet server to interconnect C-LAN Ethernet clients to 
system management applications on the switch through TCP/IP or TCP/IP and RS232 signals. 
IP Asynchronous Links supports many system management applications. See System 
Management on page 30.
Server applications send data to the switch, and the telnet server supports 80 kbps data 
throughput. Current application screen interactions, and current simultaneous session limits on 
the switch are also supported. The telnet server satisfies all current terminal emulation modes, 
including 51x, 4410, 4425, vt220, hp262x, and pctt.
The existing Access Security Gateway (ASG) feature provides access security for system 
management applications over TCP/IP. Through either a local or remote node or port, users can 
specify the remote client IP address and port number. This is the port number from which the 
switch can accept service requests. ASG must be enabled on the System-Parameters 
Customer-Options form. ASG must also be enabled for at least one customer login. The user 
can administer a timeout period that ranges from 5 to 999 minutes. But currently no provision 
exists for data encryption over the LAN.

Reliability
Duplication is a strategy to create fully redundant systems that are highly reliable. Duplication 
minimizes single failure points that can interrupt call processing. Three options are available for 
system reliability and duplication:
●Standard reliability, which does not duplicate the tone clocks, the control carrier, or any 
inter-PN connectivity.
●High reliability, which duplicates the SPE associated hardware. The Control Carrier is 
duplicated. This duplication provides duplicate SPEs and tone clocks. Inter-PN 
connectivity and EPN tone clocks are not duplicated. The strategy is to duplicate items that 
are associated with the SPE so a single fault does not cause the loss of the SPE. 
●Critical reliability, which duplicates the SPE, inter-PN connectivity, and the tone clocks.
As the level of duplication increases, the maximum number of port carriers and port circuit 
packs per cabinet decreases.

What is the Converged Communications Server?

Avaya Converged Communications Server (for SIP)
What is the Converged Communications Server?
An Avaya Converged Communications Server (CCS) is dedicated to providing a variety of 
converged communications services based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). SIP is an 
endpoint-oriented, network messaging standard defined by the Internet Engineering Task 
Force. The fundamental concept behind SIP is that a user can have multiple devices. 
A Converged Communications Server provides the necessary proxy, registrations, and 
redirection tasks necessary for SIP applications, such as Instant Messaging (IM). The server 
also provides the presence for use by SIP endpoints. A Converged Communications Server 
Release 3.0 is set to communicate with one or more Linux-based media servers that run Avaya 
Communication Manager 3.0 or later. Then, the SIP proxy server supports communication 
among the various non-SIP endpoints and new SIP-enabled endpoints. Non-SIP endpoints 
supported by Communication Manager include analog, DCP, or H.323 stations and analog, 
digital or IP trunks. New SIP endpoints include the Avaya 4602 SIP Telephone and Avaya IP 
Softphone Release 5.07 and later. These SIP endpoints are registered with the Avaya proxy. 
Therefore, Avaya media servers can manage the SIP endpoints. 
Among other features, the Converged Communications Server proxies instant messages and 
provides presence functionality to support the Avaya IP Softphone. Meanwhile, Avaya 
Communication Manager handles the voice and telephony features in the Avaya IP Softphone 
R5. Avaya Communication Manager provides added value to SIP endpoints by extending the 
SIP telephony feature set.
System Architecture
Avaya’s SIP architecture supports Converged Communications Servers of different types.
Types of CCS Hosts
There are several types of host architecture in the CCS system:
●SIngle edge server with one to many home servers
●Combined home/edge server.

Avaya Converged Communications Server (for SIP)
170
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Edge
The Edge server handles SIP requests from all domains, forwarding requests. These requests 
can be received from Home servers, from within the enterprise’s domain, and from other SIP 
proxies outside the enterprise’s domain. If an Edge server is used, then one or more Home 
servers must also exist in this architecture. Only one Edge server, or combined Home/Edge 
server, is allowed for any one domain. Edge servers can be duplexed for data redundancy.
Home
A Home server handles SIP requests for the specific domain assigned for this server. The 
Home server also forwards any requests pertaining to other domains to the Edge server. One to 
ten Home servers and exactly one Edge server is required in this scenario. Each Home server 
can support up to 15,000 SIP users. Home servers can be duplexed for data redundancy.
Home/Edge
A combined Home/Edge server performs the functions of both a Home server and an Edge 
server for an enterprise. This is a single-server scenario. That is, no other Home or Edge 
servers can exist in this architecture. Home/edge combined servers can be duplexed for data 
redundancy
Note:
Note:
It is best to architect your system, such as a combined server or multiple servers, 
with scalability in mind. This release does not support nondisruptive database 
migration.

Local Failover Option
Issue 4
June 2005
171
 
Figure 40: SIP Architecture
Local Failover Option
An optional local failover option may be configured to replicate the CCS database and server 
software for any particular system node (home, edge, or combination home/edge). In this 
duplicated (duplex) configuration, one server is active and the other is in standby mode. If the 
active server (Server A) fails or is taken out of service, it "fails-over" to the duplicated server 
(Server B). Server B then becomes active and maintains uninterrupted service. When the 
originally active server (Server A) is put back into service, it goes into standby mode. The 
duplicated server (Server B) continues in active mode, providing service to the SIP endpoints.
In each server in a duplex server configuration, a dual-port NIC card must be installed. One port 
of the dual-port NIC card on each server is then connected to that of the other server with a 
CAT5 cable. The servers use this link to maintain database synchronization. Additionally, an 
RS-232 serial port on each of the servers must be cabled together. Each server uses this link for 
monitoring the status of the other server.

Avaya Converged Communications Server (for SIP)
172
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Administrative Interfaces
All Avaya Converged Communications Servers support a secure Web interface for 
maintenance and administration. One server, usually the Edge server, also hosts the Master 
Administrator Web interface. You use the Master Administrator interface to administer SIP users 
and their associated media server extensions. The Master Administrator interface distributes 
user updates to all Home servers.
The Avaya Converged Communications Server also supports SNMP alarming and SNMP 
network management reporting.
Requirements for the SIP server
Hardware
The server hardware required for an Avaya Converged Communications Server Release 3.0 is 
the IBM e-server xSeries 305, or an IBM xSeries 306. These servers are referred to as the x305 
or x306. IBM includes various CDs with its e-servers, including Director CDs, NetXtreme gE CD, 
eServer xSeries 305 CD, and Enhanced Diagnostics CD. 
!
CAUTION:
CAUTION:
The IBM CDs are not used for installation of the Converged Communications 
Server. You must use the Avaya CCS Setup and Install CD.
An IBM Installation Guide is provided with the server. This guide includes instructions for 
installing the IBM Remote Supervisor Adapter (RSA) module and for installing the dual inline 
memory module (DIMM). Note that this memory must be added before use.
The IBM Installation Guide for the x306 includes instructions to install the SAMP card, and 
instructions on how to install extra memory.
To be used as a Converged Communications Server, the x305 or x306 needs one additional 
512MB DIMM of PC2100 266MHz CL2.5 ECC DDR SDRAM added to the existing 512MB 
installed by default. The total installed RAM is then 1GB.
Before you install any software, you must first disable the loader watchdog on the RSA or SAMP 
card. You must also verify and update the remote servicing card firmware.
If you are installing a duplex system, then install an additional Intel ProShare dual Network 
Interface Card (NIC) in each server. 

Requirements for the SIP server
Issue 4
June 2005
173
 
One universal serial bus (USB) modem must be connected to each server, one modem for each 
of the duplex servers, for remote access. A simplex server also requires a serial modem be 
connected to its RSA module. Multiple modems can be configured to share one analog phone 
line. Each phone line answers after a different number of rings. Implementation and 
maintenance services require remote access in this way.
The x305 or x306 arrives with a blank, unpartitioned hard-disk drive, and without an operating 
system or any Avaya server software files installed. These components must be installed and 
configured properly before CCS use.
In addition, the IP connectivity must be configured correctly on all Avaya media server(s) 
running Communication Manager.
Software
The Avaya Converged Communications Server uses several software components, including:
●Linux
●WebLM for licensing purposes
●Proxy, IM Logger and Trace Logger services provided by Avaya
●PostgreSQL database
●Apache Web server, for providing access to the administrative interface.
Support for SIP is enabled in Avaya Communication Manager running on any one of the 
Linux-based media servers. These servers include the following Avaya Media Servers:
- S8700, 
- S8710, 
- S8500, or 
- S8300.
Firmware
See the "SIP Support in Avaya Communication Manager 2.1.1" document for more details on 
what firmware vintages are required in certain Avaya products to ensure interoperability in a SIP 
environment.
Note:
Note:
Firmware updates are obtained only through Avaya Inc., or from its authorized 
Business Partners. Never install e-server updates obtained directly from IBM.

Avaya Converged Communications Server (for SIP)

Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Related Systems
See the "SIP Support in Avaya Communication Manager 2.1.1" document for more details on 
media server administration requirements for SIP. See the documentation and online help files 
which came with your Avaya IP Softphone R5 and, or your Avaya 4602SIP Telephone. Note the 
details on the client hardware requirements for using Instant Messaging through the Softphone 
R5 and SIP voice calling through the 4620SIP telephone.
Endpoints
You can administer users SIP endpoints as an Outboard Proxy SIP (OPS) application type in 
Avaya Communication Manager for a traditional telephony experience and features. This 
application type provides additional telephony service to SIP endpoints. 
Endpoints for SIP include the following models:
●Avaya IP Softphone Release 5.1 or higher
●Avaya SIP Softphone Release 1.0 or higher
●4602SW IP telephone
●4610SW IP telephone
●4620SW IP telephone
●Toshiba SIP handset
Third party endpoints that are RF3261 compliant might be interoperable with the Converged 
Communications Sever. But Avaya supports only Avaya endpoints and select third party 
endpoints, such as the Toshiba SIP handset.
Toshiba® SIP Handset
TheToshiba® SIP handset is designed for the Japanese market. The handset communicates 
with Avaya Communication Manager through a SIP trunk group. The handset interacts with the 
Communication Manager server using SIP signaling. Communication Manager communicates 
with the Converged Communications Server by a SIP trunk. The handsets have a high 
functionality with current telephony features and access the features through Communication 
Manager.

Avaya Expanded Meet-me Conferencing Server
The Avaya Expanded Meet-me Conferencing Server connects to a Communication Manager 
server over the customer’s LAN to provide Expanded Meet-me Conferencing. Expanded 
Meet-me Conferencing (EMMC) supports a conference bridge of up to 300 ports. This capacity 
is much greater than the limit of a 6-port conference bridge on a Communication Manager 
system without EMMC.
Note:
Note:
The actual ports available for EMMC are determined by the Communication 
Manager license file, which licenses ports in blocks of 50 (50, 100, 150, 200, 250 
and 300).The maximum number of parties included in any single conference is 
administered with Communication Manager.
All SIP-enabled media servers (S8300, S8500, S8700, or S8710 Media Servers) can use the 
the EMMC feature of Communication Manager.
All Communication Manager telephones can use EMMC. However, for SIP telephones and SIP 
softphone to be able to use EMMC, the Communication Manager configuration also requires 
the Converged Communication Server (CCS).
System Architecture
The Expanded Meet-me Conferencing application, which runs on the EMMC Server, requires 
that the EMMC Server is connected to a Communication Manager media server. With the 
following exception, the EMMC Server hardware is identical to that of the Communication 
Manager S8500B Media Server (see S8500B Media Server (front) on page 54 and S8500B 
Media Server (back) on page 55):
●The optional NIC card with 2 additional Ethernet ports is not used with Expanded Meet-me 
Conferencing.
The Server Availability Management Processor Board (SAMP) on the EMMC Server is used for 
remote maintenance and for remote reboot of the server.

Avaya Expanded Meet-me Conferencing Server
176
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
On an S8300 Media Server running Communication Manager, the internal Voice over IP (VoIP) 
resources enable the S8300 Media Server to communicate with the EMMC Server. For an 
S8500 or S8700-series Media Server running Communication Manager, the port network 
connected to the EMMC Server must have the following:
●At least one TN2302AP IP Media Processor or TN2602AP IP Media Resource 320 circuit 
pack for IP/TDM voice processing. 
The EMMC application supports only G.711 codec (both A-law and Mu-law), which means 
Communication Manager software must do the conversion. When TN2302AP is used, 
firmware vintage 72 and greater is required for RFC2833 for transport of DTMF as in the 
SIP case.
●At least one TN799DP C-LAN circuit pack for the signaling links between the 
Communication Manager server and the EMMC Server.
An example of the EMMC architecture is shown in Figure 41.
Note:
Note:
The EMMC feature does not require CCS for SIP trunking. CCS is an optional 
service if SIP endpoints also will use Expanded Meet-me Conferencing. CCS 
cannot communicate with the EMMC Server directly. CCS must establish all 
conference calls via the Communication Manager server.

Media gateways for branch locations
G150 Media Gateway
The Avaya G150 Media Gateway is an H.323 media gateway that is managed by a server 
running Communication Manager software. The G150 Media Gateway is a high-performance 
converged telephony and networking device that sits in a small branch location. The G150 
Media Gateway is designed for very small branch offices with four to 20 users. The G150 Media 
Gateway provides local trunk and telephone exchange and data networking. 
The G150 integrates seamlessly with a remote server running Avaya Communication Manager, 
Release 3.0 or later, call processing software. The remote server can be one of the following 
servers:
●DEFINITY Server CSI
●DEFINITY Server SI
●S8700 Media Server
●S8710 Media Server
●S8500 Media Server
●S8300 Media Server in a G700 Media Gateway configuration
Note:
Note:
The S8300 Media Server running in a G350 Media Gateway does not support the 
G150 Media Gateway.
The G150 Media Gateway provides an effective way to connect IP phones, analog phones, and 
trunks at a remote site to a Communication Manager server. The G150 Media Gateway 
provides full Communication Manager functionality and features to the remote site either 
through a WAN or LAN using the IP protocol.
In addition, the G150 can enter a survivable mode when service from the remote 
Communication Manager server fails. See Survivable Mode on page 189.
Finally, the G150 can be one of the following configurations:
●G150 WAN Expansion Interfaces on page 188
●Optional Wireless LAN Card & Access Point on page 191.

Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Note:
Note:
The G150 Media Gateway uses the basic hardware and design of the IP Office 
product. However, unlike the IP Office, the G150 Media Gateway usually serves 
as an H.323 gateway in accordance with the Communication Manager Remote 
Office group. As such, the Communication Manager media server manages the 
G150 Media Gateway. The G150 Media Gateway operates as a stand-alone 
gateway only when it enters survivable mode.

Effect on station and trunk limits on Communication Manager
Each G150 Media Gateway affects the system capacity limits of the controlling media server in 
the following ways:
●Each analog port on a G150 Media Gateway counts as one IP station against the media 
server’s capacity limits.
●Each analog trunk and each DS0 channel on a BRI or T1 digital trunk connected to a G150 
Media Gateway counts as on IP trunk. This number counts against the media server’s 
capacity limits. 
●Each G150 Media Gateway requires a signaling group on the media server to handle 
traffic over the G150 Media Gateway’s analog trunks. These G150 trunks appear to 
Communication Manager as a group of virtual trunks.
●Each G150 Media Gateway requires a signaling group on the media server to handle 
traffic over the G150 Media Gateway’s digital trunks. These G150 trunks also appear to 
Communication Manager as a group of virtual trunks.
Two models
The G150 Media Gateway is available in two fixed-configuration variants which provide a 
different mix of analog trunks, analog extensions, and Voice-over-IP capacity. Depending on the 
model chosen, up to a maximum of 20 extensions can be supported (4 Analog and 16 IP).
The two predefined configurations are detailed in the following table.

G150 WAN Expansion Module
This expansion card provides a single WAN connection (X21 or V35) by a standard 37-way 
D-Type socket. For details of the relevant cable specifications and pin-outs, see the "Getting 
Started with the G150 Media Gateway" document. Line speeds up to and including 2Mbps are 
supported on the interface. The carrier providing the line dictates the actual operating speed, 
i.e. in some territories the maximum speed might be 1.544Mbps.
G150 BRI Module
The G150 Media Gateway supports the standard a Basic Rate ISDN (BRI) trunk module, which 
provides 4 European Basic Rate ISDN 4-wire S/T-Bus interfaces (8 trunks). 
Details of the supported supplementary services on BRI interfaces are given in the ’Public and 
Private Voice Networks’ section. 
Note:
Note:
This module is not available in all territories. Check for availability.
G150 PRI Module 
The G150 Media Gateway also supports the PRI module. This module provides a single T1 
primary rate trunk interface for supporting voice services and fractional leased lines. This 
interface supports up to 256kbps bandwidth on IP and Frame Relay services.
Note:
Note:
This module is not available in all territories and does not support E1. Check for 
availability.
Survivable Mode
If, for any reason, communication stops between a G150 Media Gateway and the media server 
running Communication Manager, the G150 Media Gateway automatically assumes control of 
call processing for local extensions and trunks. The G150 Media Gateway enables a built-in 
H.323 gatekeeper, which allows collocated branch office IP telephones to register with the G150 
Media Gateway. Once the IP telephones are registered, the G150 Media Gateway assumes 
control of all lamps, displays, and buttons on the IP telephones. Only IP-to-IP shuffled calls are 
preserved during the transition of control to the G150 Media Gateway. Any other calls end.
Note:
Note:
The IP address of the G150 survivable gatekeeper is the last entry in the 
alternate gatekeeper list for any IP telephone that was originally registered with 
Communication Manager.

Media gateways for branch locations

Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Operation in survivable mode
In survivable mode, a G150 Media Gateway uses the parameters that the system administrator 
administers in the G150 administration interface. These parameters, which must match as 
closely as possible those established on the Communication Manager server, include the 
following features:
●Dial plan
●Trunk access codes
●System parameters
●Feature assignments
In survivable mode, the G150 allows locally connected endpoints to: 
●Call other locally-connected endpoints
●Make and receive external calls over the public network.
●Use the following features:
- Called List Identification (CLI) and Automatic Number Identification (ANI)
- Hold
- Transfer
- Call waiting indication
- Last number redial
- Drop call
In addition, G150 Media Gateway assumes control of the front panel LEDs of the G150 Media 
Gateway. As a result, G150 LED indications in survivable mode differ from those when the 
G150 Media Gateway is under control of the remote server.
While in survivable mode, incoming calls that go to voice mail coverage connect to the G150 
voice mail cache. The G150 Media Gateway uses this cache to capture and store voice 
messages. Service to the media server running Communication Manager is restored. Then, the 
G150 Media Gateway forwards the messages to the server’s central messaging system (for 
example, Modular Messaging). Users can then get their messages.
Return of control to server
In survivable mode, the G150 Media Gateway can continue to support calls indefinitely. 
However, while in survivable mode, the G150 Media Gateway attempts to reregister with the 
remote server according to administered time intervals. When the G150 Media Gateway 
successfully reregisters with the remote server, the G150 Media Gateway exits survivable 
mode. The G150 relinquishes call processing control to the remote server. The G150 forces the 
local endpoints to also reregister with the remote server. Active calls are preserved when call 
processing control returns to the remote server. When the call is completed, any endpoint that is 
on an active call reregisters with the remote server.

Optional Wireless LAN Card & Access Point
All G150 units can be configured to support connectivity to an 802.11 Wireless LAN 
infrastructure. This is enabled using the combination of the PCMCIA-format Wireless LAN Card 
and the Access Point License Key. 
An Access Point acts as a Hub in a wireless network providing connectivity between devices in 
the vicinity. In ideal conditions a range of up to 550m (1,750 ft) is achievable. But this range is 
reduced if walls and other obstacles are present. Use this capability where local conditions 
impair coverage and additional Access Points need to cover the black spots.
Figure 46: G150 WiFi Access Point
When deployed as part of a wireless network, access to the G150 Media Gateway can be 
secured against intruders. Security is based on either the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or 
RC4. WEP uses 64 bit encryption key and RC4 uses a 128 bit encryption key. Only devices with 
a matching security key can participate on the network.
The Wireless Access Point that can be enabled on the G150 Media Gateway complies to the 
IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.11b standards. These standards meet the Wireless Ethernet 
Compatibility Alliance (WECA) Wireless Fidelity Wi-Fi™ requirements for interoperability.

Avaya G250 Media Gateway
The Avaya G250 Media Gateway is an H.248 media gateway that is managed by a server 
running Communication Manager software. The G250 Media Gateway forms part of Avaya 
Enterprise Connect. Enterprise Connect is Avaya’s solution for extending communication 
capabilities from the headquarters of an organization to all collaborative branch locations. 
Avaya Enterprise Connect helps you provide the same high quality services to all organization 
members regardless of their location.
The G250 Media Gateway is a high-performance converged telephony and networking device 
that is located in small branch locations, providing all infrastructure needs in one box — 
telephone exchange and data networking. The G250 is designed for very small branch offices 
with two to 12 users. The G250 features a VoIP engine, WAN router, and Power over Ethernet 
LAN switch. The G250 supports legacy analog telephones, but not DCP telephones.
The G250 Media Gateway integrates seamlessly with the following Avaya media servers:
●S8700, 
●S8710, 
●S8500, and 
●S8300
Note:
Note:
The G250 is supported only by the "B" version of the S8300 Media Server. In this 
section, any references to the S8300 Media Server imply the S8300B version.
These servers run Avaya Communication Manager call processing software to provide the 
same top quality telephony services to the small branch office as to the headquarters of the 
organization. The media server can be located at the headquarters and serve the G250 
remotely. 
The G250 can optionally house an internal Avaya S8300 media server as a local survivable 
processor (Enhanced Local Survivability) or as the main media server for stand-alone 
deployment. As a local survivable processor, the S8300 is capable of providing full 
Communication Manager functionality in the event that the connection with the server is lost.
As an alternative to the local survivable processor, the G250 can instead be configured for 
Standard Local Survivability (SLS). See Standard Local Survivability on page 197.
The G250 supports the connection of PCs, LAN switches, IP phones, analog telephones, and 
trunks, via fixed analog and PoE ports on the chassis. A media module slot supports either of 
two WAN media modules, for connection to a WAN.
The G250 is available in a special BRI model (G250-BRI). The G250-BRI replaces three out of 
four of the G250’s fixed analog trunk ports with two ISDN BRI trunk ports. The G250-BRI model, 
therefore, supports 5 trunks altogether (one analog trunk and two B channels on each of the two 
BRI ports).

194
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
The G250 supports the following:
●Traditional telephones and trunks
●Call center agents (only when controlled by an S8500 or S8700-series Media Server or 
when controlled by an S8300 Media Server in a G350 or G700 Media Gateway)
●SSHv2 for authenticated and encrypted management channels
●RADIUS for authentication
●Remote administration access using a modem
●Inter-Gateway Alternate Routing (IGAR), a Communication Manager feature which, under 
certain definable conditions, uses the PSTN as an alternative to the WAN interface for 
routing calls
●Transport, using its VoIP services, of the following:
- Fax, Teletypewriter device (TTY), and modem calls over a corporate IP intranet using 
pass-through mode
- Fax and TTY calls using proprietary relay mode
Note:
Note:
The path between endpoints for fax transmissions must use Avaya 
telecommunications and networking equipment.
!
SECURITY ALERT:
SECURITY ALERT:
Faxes sent to non-Avaya endpoints cannot be encrypted.
- 64kbps clear channel transport in support of BRI Secure Phone and data appliances 
(does not include support for H.320 video)
- T.38 Fax over the Internet (including endpoints connected to non-Avaya systems)
- Modem tones over a corporate IP intranet
Note:
Note:
The path between endpoints for modem tone transmissions must use Avaya 
telecommunications and networking equipment.
See Administration for Network Connectivity for Avaya Communication Manager, 
555-233-504, for more information.
In addition, the G250 Media Gateway has the following features:
●802.1X Port Based access control, available on the switched 10/100 Power over Ethernet 
ports
●Compliance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS-140-2) for secure 
communications. In addition to IPSec VPN and other network capabilities, current FIPS 
compliance includes the following actions:
- Shutdown of various encryptions, including media, signaling, ASG, SSHv2, modem, USB 
port, and CHAP encryptions
- Restriction of telnet, SNMPv3, and TFTP/FTP file transfer to an IPSec tunnel

Standard Local Survivability
The G250 Media Gateway also supports Standard Local Survivability (SLS). SLS is a 
configurable software module that allows a local G250 to provide a limited amount of 
Communication Manager functionality when no link is available to the server, an LSP, or an 
Enterprise Survivable Server (ESS). SLS is configured on a system-wide basis using the new 
Provisioning and Installation Manager (PIM), or SLS can be configured on an individual G250 
using the command line interface (CLI).
Note:
Note:
SLS survivability is not supported on the G250-BRI Media Gateway.

Avaya G350 Media Gateway
The Avaya G350 Media Gateway forms part of Avaya Enterprise Connect. Enterprise Connect 
is Avaya’s solution for extending communication capabilities from the headquarters of an 
organization to all collaborative branch locations. Avaya Enterprise Connect helps you provide 
the same high quality services to all organization members regardless of their location.
The G350 is a high-performance converged telephony and networking device that sits in a small 
branch location, providing all infrastructure needs in one box. These needs include telephone 
exchange and data networking. The G350 is designed for branch offices with up to 40 users. 
The G350 features a VoIP engine and WAN router and provides full support for legacy digital 
and analog telephones.
The G350 Media Gateway integrates seamlessly with the following Avaya media servers:
●S8700, 
●S8710, 
●S8500, and 
●S8300
These servers run Avaya Communication Manager call processing software to provide the 
same top quality telephony services to the small branch office as to the headquarters of the 
organization. The media server can be located at the headquarters and serve the G350 
remotely. 
The G350 can optionally house an internal Avaya S8300 media server as a local survivable 
processor or as the main media server for stand-alone deployment.
In addition to advanced and comprehensive telephony services, the G350 provides full data 
networking services, precluding the need for a WAN router or LAN switch.
The G350 is a modular device, adaptable to support different combinations of endpoint devices. 
Pluggable media modules provide interfaces for different types of telephones and trunks. A 
combination is selected to suit the needs of the branch.
A LAN media module with Ethernet ports that are PoE standard compliant provides support for 
IP telephones as well as all other types of data devices. A range of telephony modules provides 
full support for legacy equipment such as analog and digital telephones.
Features
The G350 supports the following:
●Traditional telephones and trunks
●SSHv2 for authenticated and encrypted management channels

204
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
●RADIUS for authentication
●Remote administration access using a modem
●Converged Network Analyzer (CNA) test plug for use with CNA, a distributed system tool 
for real-time network monitoring that detects and diagnoses converged network-related 
issues
●Inter-Gateway Alternate Routing (IGAR), a Communication Manager feature which, under 
certain definable conditions, uses the PSTN as an alternative to the WAN interface for 
routing calls
In addition, the G350 Media Gateway has the following features:
●802.1X Port Based access control, available on the switched 10/100 Power over Ethernet 
ports
●Compliance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS-140-2) for secure 
communications. In addition to IPSec VPN and other network capabilities, current FIPS 
compliance includes the following actions:
- Shutdown of various encryptions, including media, signaling, ASG, SSHv2, modem, USB 
port, and CHAP encryptions
- Restriction of telnet, SNMPv3, and TFTP/FTP file transfer to an IPSec tunnel
●DHCP Server for providing IP addresses to IP hosts, for example, to IP Phones
●DHCP client for retrieving dynamic IP addresses from a DHCP server, especially an 
Internet Service Provider when using PPPoE and broadband cable modem connections 
●Dynamic Call Admission Control (CAC) for Fast Ethernet, Serial, and GRE tunnel 
interfaces.
Dynamic CAC informs the primary controller of the actual bandwidth of the interface and 
tells the controller to block calls when the bandwidth is exhausted.
●Dynamic IP addressing
●Firewall support, with stateless access lists that filter traffic based on IP and Protocol 
headers
●Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE) Tunnels
●Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) support, which enhances the ability of network 
management tools to discover and maintain accurate network topologies in multi-vendor 
environments
●Management Information Base (MIB) and threshold alarming support for monitoring VoIP 
quality
●Modem backup connection, which provides redundant connectivity between the G350 
Media Gateway and its primary controller using a serial modem.

Deployment modes
The G350 is a modular device with multiple configuration possibilities to meet specific individual 
needs. Six slots in the G350 chassis house a customized selection of media modules. These 
media modules connect to different types of circuit switched phones, trunks and data devices. 
One of the slots can house an internal media server. A major configuration option is of which 
type of media server to deploy. The media server can be a media module or a stand-alone 
device.
The G350 can be deployed in one of two basic working modes:
●Distributed Avaya Enterprise Connect. In this mode, an external media server controls 
the G350. This can be a stand-alone media server, such as the S8500 or the S8700/
S8710, or a separate media gateway in a standalone configuration. 
The G350 can also house an S8300 Media Server module to function as a Local 
Survivable Processor (LSP). This LSP can take over control of the G350 if the external 
media server stops serving the G350. For a summary of how the LSP in a G350 works, 
see S8300 Media Server in an LSP configuration on page 38.
●Stand-alone. In this mode, an internally housed S8300 Media Server module controls the 
G350. See Avaya S8300 Media Server with a G700, G350, or G250 Media Gateway on 
page 33.
Multiple G350s can be deployed in many remote branches of a large organization. Large 
branches or main offices can deploy an Avaya G700 Media Gateway, which provides similar 
functionality to the G350 for a larger number of users. Up to 50 G350 and G700 Media 
Gateways can be controlled by a single S8300 Media Server. Up to 250 G350 and G700 Media 
Gateways can be controlled by a single external S8500, S8700, or S8710 Media Server.

Media modules
Avaya media modules convert the voice path of the traditional circuits, such as analog trunk, T1/
E1, and DCP, to a TDM bus. The VOIP engine then converts the voice path from the TDM bus 
to packetized VoIP, compressed or uncompressed, on an Ethernet connection.
The media modules reside in the G350 Media Gateway and interact with the motherboard and 
backplane.

Expansion modules
The G700 Media Gateway is architecturally based on the Avaya P330 and C360 switches. 
Therefore, customers can use selected P330 expansion modules with the G700 Media 
Gateway. The P330 local-area network (LAN) and wide-area network (WAN) expansion 
modules connect directly to the G700 Media Gateway without requiring additional hardware. 
Two types of expansion modules are available from Avaya:
●X330 WAN Access routing modules
●P330 LAN expansion modules
X330 WAN Access routing module
Customers with multiple branch offices need network solutions that are simple flexible and 
scalable. The Avaya X330 WAN Access routing module allows customers to deploy a unified, 
high-performance LAN/WAN infrastructure in one data stack.

CAUTION:
CAUTION:
Avaya expansion modules and Octaplane stacking modules are not 
hot-swappable. The system must be turned off to before you remove or insert an 
expansion module.
C360 Converged Stackable Switches
For information about C360 converged stackable switches, see Avaya C360 Ethernet 
Switches on page 427.
Octaplane stacking fabric
"Octaplane" is a name for an Avaya hardware capability to bundle stackable components using 
4-Gbps communication in each direction. This technology combines separate units into a larger 
logical switch using different lengths of cables. These cables connect to the expansion slots in 
the rear of the units. These cables are wired in a ring configuration, which provides redundancy 
to the stack. If a single unit fails, the stack integrity is maintained. You can remove, or replace, 
any single unit without disrupting operation or performing stack-level reconfiguration.
The following table lists the cables available to create an Octaplane stack.

page 344.
Fans
The G700 Media Gateway contains four 12-volt fans. These fans are monitored and SNMP can 
provide reports to a management station.
LEDs
The G700 Media Gateway uses two types of LEDs:
●Media module
●System-level
Although some media modules have additional LEDs, a standard 3-LED pattern on each of their 
faceplates indicates the following conditions:
●Red – Fault condition
This LED also lights when the media module is physically inserted, and turns off when the 
board initializes.
●Green – Test condition
●Yellow – In-use condition
See the following figure for the LEDs on the media module.

220
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Figure 51: Media modules LEDs
Media module LEDs
Media-module LEDs have the following characteristics:
●Each media module has at least three LEDs to indicate module and port status or 
maintenance and administration modes.
●The location, spacing, and labeling is fixed for all LEDs on all media modules.
●The LEDs are mounted on the media module’s printed wiring board, and placed so the 
LEDs show through an opening.
System-level LEDs
The system-level LED board:
●Provides visual indication of both system and Ethernet-port status and allow customers to 
change between these status-indication modes. 
●Resides in the upper-left front of the G700 Media Gateway. The LEDs themselves reside 
in the board’s oblong fascia panel. 
You must insert or remove the LED board when you insert or remove the S8300 Media Server.

Software
The G700 Media Gateway contains the following software:
●Gateway software
●Maintenance software
Gateway software
Gateway software is responsible for:
●Individual media-gateway operations
●Terminating H.248 on the G700 Media Gateway
●Interacting with maintenance operations
Maintenance software
An Avaya media server with a G700 Media Gateway has a dual maintenance strategy. 
Maintenance software runs on both the G700 Media Gateway’s and the media server’s platform 
for each platform’s subsystems.
The G700 media gateway’s maintenance software performs initialization and motherboard 
maintenance and internal environmental monitoring. Whereas, after the G700 Media Gateway 
registers with the media server, the server’s maintenance software tests and initializes the 
gateway’s media modules. Although the media gateway’s maintenance software monitors its 
own media modules, the media server controls these modules and their associated ports. The 
media server also maintains error logs.
Connectivity with an S8700 Media Server as Primary Controller
The G700 Media Gateway with an S8700 Media Server as its primary controller connects 
through a LAN to a TN799DP C-LAN circuit pack. This circuit pack is mounted in a media 
gateway. This configuration is basically the same whether the G700 Media Gateway has an 
S8300 Media Server as a local survivable processor (LSP) or does not have an LSP. The 
following figure is an example of G700 Media Gateway connectivity.

Media modules
Avaya media modules convert the voice path of the traditional circuits, such as analog trunk, T1/
E1, and DCP, to a TDM bus. The VOIP engine then converts the voice path from the TDM bus 
to packetized compressed or uncompressed VoIP on an Ethernet connection.
The media modules reside in the G700 Media Gateway and interact with the motherboard and 
backplane. The following figure shows a top view of a media module.

Fans
Three 12-volt DC variable-speed fans cooling for the G600 Media Gateway. The fans are 
integrated into the back of the cabinet. The fans pull air through the front and the left side and 
up through the cabinet. Air exits from the back of the cabinet. The 650A Global Power supply 
controls the speed of the fans. The 650A Global Power supply varies the fan input voltage 
between 8 VDC and 14 VDC, depending on a temperature sensor that is mounted in the power 
supply, and adjusts each fan’s operating speed accordingly
The fan assembly includes the three fans, a base plate to which the fans are attached, wiring, 
and an AMP connector. The AMP connector plugs into a cable that connects to the backplane. 
The assembly is easily installed and removed. You must replace the entire assembly if a fan 
fails. If a fan fails, the following events take place:
●An alarm through the power supply is detected as a power alarm.
●The remaining fans go into high speed.
●The red LED on the 650A Global Power supply faceplate lights up.

Avaya G650 Media Gateway (default for new systems)
Overview
The Avaya G650 Media Gateway is a fourteen slot, rack mounted carrier configured for TN form 
factor circuit packs. The G650 Media Gateway is used with the S8500, S8700, and S8710 
Media Servers. The G650 is 8U or 14 inches (35.6 centimeters) high and mounts in a standard 
19 inch (48.3 centimeters) data rack. The G650 uses one or two 655A power supplies, 
operating on AC and/or DC input power. Either power supply can provide all the power needed 
by the G650. When two power supplies exist, they share the power load. One power supply can 
operate on AC power and the other on DC power. However, each power supply has its own AC 
power cord so that both power sources can power the Media Gateway simultaneously. Both 
power supplies can take input power from the DC input cable if their AC power fails.
Power fail or not.The system will always use AC power if available.
See Figure 55: G650 Media Gateway on page 231 for an example of the G650 Media 
Gateway.

G650 provides options for front or mid mounting. Although the G650 can be mounted in a 19 
inch (48.3 centimeters) four-post data rack, the G650 does not mount simultaneously to all four 
posts. When mounted in a four-post rack, the G650 uses the front mounting position.

Mounting a single G650
A single G650, equipped with feet, can be table or floor mounted. Side-by-side G650s, 
connected by TDM/LAN cables, are not supported. In a single configuration, the G650 always 
has an A carrier address.
Mounting multiple G650s
Multiple G650s, up to five, can be mounted in a rack and connected by TDM/LAN cables to 
create a G650 stack. Multiple G650s must be vertically adjacent and their front panels must 
align in the same vertical plane. For example, carrier A is always below carrier B, which is 
always below carrier C, and so on through carrier E. Note that existing TDM/LAN cables used 
for the G600 cabinets are not compatible with the G650.
Multiple G650s, up to five, can be mounted in a rack but not connected by TDM/LAN cables. In 
this case each G650 is defined as a port network. Each gateway requires its own interface 
hardware (EI, ATM-EI, TN2312BP IPSI). Note that with this configuration, all the G650s have a 
carrier address of A. 
Carrier addressing
The carrier position, A through E, must be set on all G650s. The carrier address is set using a 
small printed circuit card that is plugged into one of five, A through E, connectors inside the 
carrier.
See Figure 56: Printed circuit card on page 233 for an example and location of the printed 
circuit card.

Multiple G650s can be rack mounted with some connected by TDM/LAN cables, and others not 
connected by TDM/LAN cables. For example, a customer can request that the G650 in the 
bottom of the rack not be connected to another G650. The carrier address of the G650 in the 
bottom of the rack is A. The customer can request that the next two G650s in the rack be 
connected together by a TDM/LAN cable. The carrier address of the lower of these two G650s 
is A, and the address of the upper G650 is B. And the customer can request that two additional 
G650s be placed in the rack and connected by a TDM/LAN cable. The carrier address of the 
lower of these two G650s is A and the address of the upper G650 is B. In this example, the 
G650s in the stack form three independent port networks:
●PN 1 has one G650 with an A carrier address
●PN 2 has two G650s with an A and B carrier address
●PN 3 has two G650s with an A and B carrier address
The carrier address of an individual rack mounted, table mounted, or floor mounted G650 is A.

CMC1 Media Gateway 
The CMC1 Media Gateway supports the DEFINITY® Server CSI and Avaya S8700/S8710, and 
S8500 Media Servers. A CMC1 Media Gateway has the following characteristics:
●A wall-mount design, but also mountable on the floor or on a table where required.
●Ten universal port slots, plus one power supply slot. In the CMC1 Media Gateway that 
contains the DEFINITY CSI server (TN2402) and tone clock (TN2182C) circuit packs, 
some slots are unavailable for port and service circuit packs. In the remaining CMC1 
Media Gateways that are connected to the server, all 10 slots are available for port circuit 
packs or service circuit packs.
●Available with the standard reliability option only.
●25.5 inches (64.8 centimeters) wide, 24.5 inches (62.2 centimeters) high, and 11.3 inches 
(28.7 centimeters) deep.
●Weighs from 50 to 60 pounds (22.7 to 27.2 kilograms).
●Limited to one port network (PN) that consists of a maximum of three CMC1 Media 
Gateways. A control CMC1 is designated "A". One or two optional CMC1s are designated 
"B," and "C," respectively. The DIP switch on the backplane sets the cabinet address ID 
within the PN.
●Circuit packs that are inserted and removed from the left side. Cabinet I/O is from the right 
side.
●Shielded TDM/LAN bus cables that interconnect the CMC1s in a PN.
●AC-powered only. There are no internal batteries, and external DC power is not an option. 
However, an external UPS is supported.
●Two 12-volt DC variable-speed fans in the bottom of the cabinet provide CMC1 cooling. 
The 650A Global Power supply provides speed control. The 650A varies the fan input 
voltage between 8VDC and 14VDC depending on a temperature sensor that is mounted in 
the power supply. 
A DEFINITY Server CSI can support up to three CMC1 media gateways.

Expansion control cabinet for a DEFINITY
Server SI, S8700 Media Server, S8710 Media
Server, or S8500 Media Server
An expansion control cabinet (J58890N) is always in the A position in an expansion PN stack of 
SCC1 Media Gateways. The expansion control cabinet contains ports. It also contains a TN775 
maintenance circuit pack. An AC or a DC power supply resides in the right side of the cabinet.
An expansion control cabinet has optional port circuit packs in port slots 2 to 17. 
Fiber-connect configurations - In fiber-connect configurations, the expansion control cabinet 
contains a tone clock and one or two expansion interface circuit packs to connect to the other 
PN(s), a CSS, or an ATM switch. However, if the PN has an IPSI circuit pack for a control 
connection to the S8500 or S8700-series Media Server, the tone clock is not used. Instead the 
built-in tone clock capability of the IPSI circuit pack is used. In this case, the IPSI circuit pack is 
connected by faceplate ribbon cable to the TN775D Maintenance circuit pack.
IP-connect configurations - In an IP-connect PN, the expansion control cabinet is necessary 
in the A position. It contains a TN775 Maintenance circuit pack in MTCE slot and an IPSI circuit 
pack in the tone clock slot. At least one IP Media Processor or IP Media Resource 320 circuit 
pack is required in the PN and should be inserted into the A01 position of the expansion control 
cabinet. Additional IP Media Processors or IP Media Resources may be inserted in any other 
cabinets or slots in the PN. The other slots in an expansion control cabinet can contain optional 
port circuit packs.
!
CAUTION:
CAUTION:
Inserting the wrong circuit pack into the A01 slot of the expansion control cabinet 
may result in no ringing, circuit pack conflicts, and outages when lightning strikes. 
The A01 slot should contain only an Expansion Interface circuit pack, an IP 
Media Processor, or an IP Media Resource 320. 
An IP Media Processor or IP Media Resource 320 can be inserted into almost 
any slot in the carrier. But in a conversion from a fiber-connect to an IP-connect 
configuration, one of these circuit packs should be inserted into the A01 slot that 
is vacated by removal of the EI circuit pack.
If the SCC1 PN connects to branch location media gateways or adjuncts in the network, 
supports IP endpoints, or uses IP trunks, the following circuit pack is also required:

Port cabinet for a DEFINITY Server SI,
S8700 Media Server, or S8500 Media Server
Port cabinets reside in the DEFINITY Server SI PPN and in expansion PNs. An AC or a DC 
power supply resides in the right side of each cabinet. A TN755 neon power unit can be 
installed in slot 18, which uses some of the space of slot 17 and prevents the use of slot 17.
For a DEFINITY Server SI PPN, all slots are available for optional circuit packs.
For a fiber-connect PN, slot 1 contains a Tone-Clock circuit pack when the port cabinet is 
in the B position of a PN in a duplicated control/duplicated bearer (critical-reliability) system. 
Slot 2 contains an EI or, for S8700-series Media Server only, an ATM Interface circuit pack 
for a critical-reliability system. Slot 3 would also contain an EI circuit pack for direct-connect 
critical-reliability system. Otherwise, all slots are available for optional circuit packs.
For an IP-connect PN, slot 1 contains an IPSI circuit pack when the cabinet is in the B 
position and the PN is connected to a duplicated control (high reliability) network. The other 
slots in a port carrier can contain optional port circuit packs.
The following figure shows an example of a port cabinet.

MCC1 Media Gateway
An MCC1 Media Gateway can be used as a port network (PN) cabinet. Doors in front of and 
behind the MCC1 Media Gateway protect the internal equipment and allow easy access to the 
circuit packs. Each MCC1 Media Gateway rolls on casters. Leveling feet keep the cabinet from 
rolling. Each lower corner of an MCC1 Media Gateway can be bolted to the floor, if required.
An MCC1 Media Gateway is a 70-inch (178-centimeter) cabinet that has up to five carriers. 
MCC1 Media Gateways are one of four types:
●A DEFINITY Server SI PPN that contains the ports, SPE, an interface to an EPN, and 
possibly a CSS.
●A PN or multiple PN configuration in an S8500 or S8700-series Media Server configuration
●A DEFINITY Server SI Expansion Port Network (EPN) that contains additional ports, 
interfaces to the PPN cabinet and other EPNs, and the maintenance interface.
●A PN that contains a switch node, which is an SN in a system that has a CSS.
Carriers hold circuit packs and connect the circuit packs to power, the TDM bus, and the packet 
bus. Carriers are one of five types:
●Control carrier (DEFINITY Server SI PPN only)
●Optional duplicated control carrier (DEFINITY Server SI PPN only)
●Optional port carrier (PPN, EPN, and PN)
●Expansion control carrier (EPN and PN)
●Optional switch node carrier (PPN, EPN, and PN)
See Typical PN cabinet for all server models on page 255 for an example of the MCC1 Media 
Gateway layout.
Auxiliary cabinet
The auxiliary cabinet contains the hardware to install optional equipment. The cabinet allows 
carrier, rack (width of 23 in. [58.4 cm]), and panel types of mounting. An auxiliary cabinet 
contains the following components:
●A fuse panel (J58889AB) that distributes -48 VDC to fused cabinet circuits 
●An AC power receptacle strip that provides switched and unswitched 120-VAC receptacles
●A DC connector block for cabinets powered by:
- An external DC source
- An AC-to-DC converter that:
●Accepts AC power from a switched outlet of an AC power strip
●Sends converted DC power onto the required DC connector block

IP-connect port network
In an IP-connect PN, the expansion control carrier is necessary in the A position. It contains a 
required TN775 Maintenance circuit pack in the MNTC slot and an IPSI circuit pack in the tone 
clock slot. At least one IP Media Processor or IP Media Resource 320 circuit pack is required in 
the PN and should be inserted into the A01 position of the expansion control carrier. Additional 
IP Media Processors or IP Media Resources may be inserted in any other carriers or slots in the 
PN. The other slots in an expansion control cabinet can contain optional port circuit packs.
!
CAUTION:
CAUTION:
Inserting the wrong circuit pack into the A01 slot of the expansion control cabinet 
may result in improper call processing. The A01 slot should contain only an 
Expansion Interface circuit pack, an IP Media Processor, or an IP Media 
Resource 320. 
An IP Media Processor or IP Media Resource 320 can be inserted into almost 
any slot in the carrier. But in a conversion from a fiber-connect to an IP-connect 
configuration, one of these circuit packs should be inserted into the A01 slot that 
is vacated by removal of the E.I. circuit pack.
Port carrier for DEFINITY Server SI, 
S8700 Media Server, or S8500 Media Server (J58890BB)
A port carrier (J58890BB) contains the following slots:
●Port slot locations 1 to 20 for the port circuit packs. 
For a DEFINITY Server SI PPN, all slots are available for optional circuit packs.
For a fiber-connect PN, slot 1 contains a Tone-Clock or IPSI circuit pack when the port 
carrier is in the B position of an EPN cabinet in a duplicated bearer configuration. Slot 2 
contains an EI or ATM Interface circuit pack for a duplicated bearer configuration. Slot 3 
would also contain an EI circuit pack for a direct-connect configuration. Otherwise, all slots 
are available for optional circuit packs.
For an IP-connect PN, slot 1 contains an IPSI circuit pack when the port carrier is in the B 
position of a PN in a duplicated control network configuration. An IP Media Processor or IP 
Media Resource 320 circuit pack is required in the PN, but can be inserted into any carrier 
included in the PN. The other slots in a port carrier can contain optional port circuit packs.
If the MCC1 PN connects to branch location media gateways or adjuncts in the network, 
supports IP endpoints, or uses IP trunks, the following circuit pack is also required:
- TN799DP control LAN (C-LAN) interface on page 297

1217B AC power supply
Issue 4
June 2005
267
 
Circuit packs and power supplies
1217B AC power supply
A 1217B power supply is used only with an SCC1 Media Gateway. This power supply provides 
additional protection in the event of an overload. An overload triggers a power supply alarm, but 
the system’s cooling fans continue to run, and the power supply continues to function. This 
power supply replaces the WP-91153 L3 and L4-25 and is fully backward compatible.
This power-factor-corrected supply accepts 50- or 60-Hz AC input, while auto-ranging between 
90- and 264-VAC input. This multiple-output power supply provides regulated DC outputs and 
AC ringer outputs that are switch-selectable 20- or 25-Hz AC. The 1217B power supply meets 
the:
●Harmonic-distortion requirements of IEC1000-3-2 (PFC)
●Immunity requirements of IEC 1000-4
●Safety requirements of IEC 950
●Current UL requirements and CSA requirements
The 1217B power supply mounts in a carrier’s power supply slot. A power cord with a 
three-prong plug on one end connects the supply to a dedicated AC power source.
631DA1 AC power unit
A 631DA1 power unit accepts 60-Hz, 120-VAC input power. The unit provides +5V DC power 
and up to 60A for the carrier backplanes of an MCC1 Media Gateway.
If AC input power fails, the power unit can convert 144 VDC from optional batteries in an 
AC power-distribution unit to +5 VDC. A circuit in the optional battery charger detects the higher 
equivalent (AC- or DC-input) voltage and changes to the correct input voltage.

Circuit packs and power supplies
268
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
631DB1 AC power unit
A 631DB1 power unit accepts 60-Hz, 120-VAC input power. The unit provides DC power for the 
backplanes of an MCC1 Media Gateway’s carriers at the following voltages:
●–48 V at 8 A
●–5 V at 6 A
. The DC output of –48 V also drives the cabinet’s fans.
If AC input power fails, the power unit can convert 144 VDC from optional batteries in an 
AC power-distribution unit to +5 VDC. A circuit in the optional battery charger detects the higher 
equivalent (AC- or DC-input) voltage and switches in the correct input voltage.
649A DC power converter
A 649A power converter converts a DC input of –48 V into DC outputs of:
●–48 V at 10 A
●±5 V at 6 A
for an MCC1 Media Gateway. Within a carrier, these outputs are distributed to the circuit packs’ 
slots. Only one 649A converter is required per carrier except for switch node (SN) carriers. SN 
carriers require two converters, one on each end. The use of the 649A power unit also allows an 
increase in the number of telephones that each carrier can support.
650A AC power unit
This global power-factor-corrected supply accepts 47- to 63-Hz AC input, while auto-ranging 
between 85-VAC and 264-VAC input. The 650A power unit provides 330 watts of total output 
and provides multiple DC outputs as follows:
●+5.1 VDC at 28 A
●–5.1 VDC at 1.0 A
●–48 VDC at 4.5 A
●+8- to +14 VDC at 1.6 A (fan-speed control)
This output (+12 VDC nominal) controls the fans’ speed. The voltage varies with the 
ambient air temperature at the inlet below the power supply. If this voltage reaches +14 
VDC, the system activates a FANALM signal.
●–115 to –150 VDC at 200 mA (neon bus)

655A power supply
Issue 4
June 2005
269
 
The 650A power unit has three switch-selectable outputs for ringing:
●20-Hz AC output at 85 V RMS and 80 mA, — centered about –48 VDC at 180 mA
●25-Hz AC output at 72 V RMS and 8 to 80 mA, — centered about –48 VDC at 180 mA
●Two 50-Hz AC outputs at 28 V RMS, effectively 56 V, and 220 mA, — biased about –48 
and 0 VDC at 70 mA balanced
655A power supply
The G650 can use one or two 655A power supplies that can have both AC and DC input power 
present. Either power supply can provide all the power needed by the G650. When there are 
two power supplies, they share the power load. One power supply can operate on AC power 
and the other on DC power. But, if AC power is available, the system always uses AC power. 
The 655A power supply is: 
●The only power supply supported in the G650
●Not backward compatible to other carrier types
If you use only one 655A power supply, place it in slot 0. If you are using two power supplies, 
place them in slots 0 and 15.
Note:
Note:
You can insert or remove a redundant power supply and not affect the G650 if the 
other 655A power supply is operating. 
Input power
The 655A power supply can operate on either AC or DC input power. But, if AC power is 
available, the system always uses AC power. One power supply can operate on AC power, and 
the other on DC power. The power supplies use AC power first and switch to DC power if AC 
power fails or is not present. 
AC power
Commercial AC is the primary input power source. Both slot 0 and slot 15 have dedicated AC 
input. The 655A power supply can operate on AC input that ranges from 90 to 264 VAC at 47 to 
63 Hz. The nominal ranges for AC power are:
●100 to 120 VAC at 50 or 60 Hz
●200 to 240 VAC at 50 or 60 Hz

DC power
Minus 48VDC power can be supplied simultaneously as backup power. One -48VDC power 
input point is provided on the G650 backplane and is distributed through the backplane to each 
power supply.
655A faceplate LEDs
The five LEDs on the faceplate of the 655A power supply are in a vertical line with the red LED 
on top. These five LEDs provide the following status:
●Red - This LED:
- Lights when there is a failure in either the power supply or the fans. For a G650 with 
redundant power supplies, a failure in the fan assembly results lights this LED on both 
power supplies.
- Flashes off once per second when the software shuts down the ring voltage output of a 
power supply
●Yellow - This LED:
- Lights when the status of the power supply and fans is OK
- Flashes once per second when the software shuts down a single power supply, in a 
carrier with operational redundant power supplies
●Green - Lights when there is AC power applied to the power supply
●Green - Lights when there is DC power applied to the power supply 
●Green - Lights when the power supply is supplying ringing to the G650

655A ring generation
The 655A provides either North American ringing (20Hz) or European/International (25Hz) 
ringing. The 655A also has a setting to provide no ringing. This setting is applicable when the 
customer supplies a ring generator that is external to the power supply. An example of an 
external ring generator is the TN2202 French ringing circuit pack.
The 655A power supply provides a physical slide switch to select the frequency of the ring 
generator. The options are:
●20Hz — North American
●25Hz — European and international
●Other — No ringing output. Applicable when an external ring generator is used such as the 
TN2202 French ringing circuit pack. 
You must remove the power supply from the G650 when you change the ringing frequency 
selection. The ringing frequency selection switch is on the back of the power supply.

Only one 655A supplies ringing to the G650. The power supply in slot 0 in the G650 with an A 
carrier address is the default for ringing. The system uses this default 655A unless the 655A 
has failed or the software has commanded it to shut down. When a G650 carrier has redundant 
power supplies, one supply automatically supplies ringing if the other power supply fails. 
A 655A provides ringing to only one G650 carrier. For example, the 655A power supplies in 
carrier A supply ringing to carrier A only. Meanwhile, the power supplies in carrier D supply 
ringing to carrier D only. If the ring generation in both of a carrier’s power supplies fail, no other 
power supply provides ringing for the carrier.
655A replaceable DC-input fuse
The 655A provides a replaceable 25 ADC-input fuse that protects the DC input from reverse 
voltage on the -48Vdc input. If reverse voltage is applied to the G650 and 655A power supply, 
the 655A fuse will blow open protecting the 655A from damage. 
If the G650 will not operate on DC input (only), the fuse should be inspected by removing the 
655A power supply from the G650 and inspecting the protection fuse. 
The fuse is located on the rear surface of the 655A power supply. A spare fuse is also located 
on the rear surface.
676D DC power supply
A –48 VDC source supplies power to the DC power supply at up to 25 A. The 676C power 
supply for the SCC1 Media Gateway, produces DC outputs of +5, –5, –48, and +12 VDC. The 
DC outputs are distributed across the cabinet’s backplane to each circuit pack’s slot. The output 
value and frequency of the AC ringing voltage depend on the country of use. The power supply 
has circuit breakers and electromagnetic interference (EMI) filtering.

●Support for the enhanced maintenance capabilities of the ICSU. These circuit packs can 
communicate with Avaya Interactive Response System.
●Downloadable firmware
●Support for echo cancellation. 
The echo cancellation capability of the TN464HP is selectable on a per-channel basis. The 
TN464HP DS1 interface automatically turns off echo cancellation when the interface 
detects a 2100-Hz phase-reversed tone generated by high-speed modems (56-kbps). But 
the interface does not turn off echo cancellation when the interface detects a 2100-Hz 
straight tone generated by low-speed modems (9.6-kbps). Echo cancellation improves a 
low-speed data call.
The TN464HP DS1 interface is intended for customers who are likely to encounter echo. 
This echo can be over circuits that are connected to the public network. The occurrence of 
echo is higher if the switch is configured for ATM, IP, or other complex services and 
interfaces to certain local service providers. These local service providers do not routinely 
install echo cancellation equipment in all their circuits. A common source of echo is "hybrid" 
circuits, where conversions between 2-wire analog circuits and 4-wire digital circuits take 
place. The TN464HP DS1 interface cancels echo with delays of up to 96 milliseconds.

The TN767 DS1 interface circuit pack provides a DSX1-level physical interface to the DS1 
facility. The TN767 circuit pack has unpolarized line out (LO) and line in (LI) signal lead pairs.
The TN767 circuit pack supports DS1 rate digital facility connectivity. The circuit pack supports 
CO, Tie, DID, and off-premises stations (OPS) port types. These port types use the robbed-bit 
signaling protocol. On DEFINITY CSI and SI Media Servers, this circuit pack supports 
ISDN-PRI connectivity. For these applications, the signaling D-channel can connect from the 
TN767 circuit pack to the processor interface by a permanent switched call over the TDM bus.
On S8500, S8700, and S8710 Media Servers, this circuit pack does not directly support 
D-channel signaling and thus does not directly support ISDN-PRI connectivity. However, the 
TN767 circuit can indirectly support D-channel signaling provided that the central office 
supports nonfacility associated signaling (NFAS). In this case, you use NFAS administration on 
the server. This administration associates the D-channel of another T1/E1 circuit pack, usually a 
TN464, with the TN767 circuit pack.

TN771DP maintenance and test
The TN771DP maintenance test circuit pack performs maintenance functions. These functions 
include packet bus reconfiguration. This reconfiguration allows diagnosis and correction of 
recoverable packet bus failures before the link access procedure on the D-channel (LAPD) links 
fail. LAPD is a link-layer protocol on the ISDN-BRI and ISDN-PRI data link layer (level 2). LAPD 
provides data transfer between two devices and error and flow control on multiple logical links. 
LAPD swaps spare leads with the malfunctioning leads to recover packet bus failures that 
involve up to three malfunctioning leads. Malfunctioning leads, in this case, are 1 or 2 data or 
parity leads and one control lead.
Other maintenance functions include ISDN-PRI testing that originates and terminates loopback 
tests on ISDN facilities. The testing provides bit and block error rate information that indicates 
ISDN facility quality.
The TN771DP circuit pack can be updated using the firmware download feature, which requires 
use of the TN799 C-LAN circuit pack interface.
A TN771DP circuit pack is required for:
●Any CSI system that uses a TN2198 BRI circuit pack. Otherwise, a TN771DP circuit pack 
is not required.
●An SI system processor port network (PPN) that is equipped with packet endpoints 
(ISDN-BRI lines or trunks, ISDN-PRI trunks, IP trunks, IP stations, ATM-CES, and ASAI). 
Or the PPN is a critical reliability, or fully duplicated, system. A critical reliability system 
with packet endpoints requires a TN771DP circuit pack in each expansion port network 
(EPN). Otherwise, a TN771DP circuit pack is not required.

Fixed Base (WFB) radio units. This interface is used for the DEFINITY Wireless Business 
System. The TN789B circuit pack contains a main processor to handle data line circuit (DLC) 
and upper medium access (MAC) layers of firmware. The TN789B circuit pack also contains 
two lower MAC processors. one processor for each radio interface. Each radio interface is 
referred to as an I2 interface.
The I2 link is the connection between the radio controller (RC) and the WFB. The RC supports 
up to two I2 links. Each link consists of three pairs of twisted-pair cable: the transmit pair, the 
receive pair, and the local power pair. The transmit pair transfers WFB control and frame 
information from the RC to the WFB. The receive pair transfers status and frame information 
from the WFB to the RC. If the RC cannot provide power to the WFB, a third pair, to the WFB, 
can supply local power. When possible, the transmit pair and the receive pair provide phantom 
power from the RC to the WFB.

TN792 duplication interface
In a high reliability or critical reliability DEFINITY SI system, a duplication interface copies the 
contents of memory from the primary Switch Processing Element (SPE) to a standby SPE. 
Therefore, the standby SPE can take over immediately when the former fails. The TN792 
duplication interface (DUPINT) uses the Enhanced M-Bus of the DEFINITY SI TN2404 
processor for this memory shadowing function. The Enhanced M-bus supports 32-bit 
addressing and data access (versus 16-bit for the M-bus). In this case, the Enhanced M-bus 
transfers data faster and shadows a larger area of memory than the M-bus. The M-bus is still 
supported.
You need two TN792 circuit packs, one for the primary control carrier and one for the standby. 
You can replace TN772 duplication interfaces with TN792s, but you must replace them in pairs. 
A TN772 circuit pack cannot communicate with a TN792 circuit pack.

TN799DP control LAN (C-LAN) interface
The TN799DP control LAN (C-LAN) interface provides TCP/IP connectivity over Ethernet or 
Point to Point Protocol (PPP) to adjuncts such as the following:
- Avaya Call Management System (CMS)
- INTUITY AUDIX
- Distributed Communication System (DCS)
- printers
- call detail recording (CDR)
- property management systems (PMS)
Support for the TN2302AP IP Media Interface or TN2602AP IP Media Resource 320 for H.323 
functionality, ATM interfaces, and WAN port network connectivity (PNC) also require the C-LAN.
The C-LAN operates at 10 or 100 Mbps and full duplex or half duplex, both of which are 
administrable. The C-LAN provides connectionless UDP sockets for IP solutions support. The 
C-LAN also supports 500 remote sockets, with support for 4-Kbyte UDP sockets. The C-LAN 
supports variable-length ping and the traceroute and netstat network testing commands. 
The C-LAN circuit pack provides call control for all IP endpoints that are connected to the S8700 
Media Server using the G600 Media Gateway or G650 Media Gateway. A maximum number of 
64 C-LAN circuit packs can be used for each configuration. The number of required C-LAN 
circuit packs depends on the number of devices that are connected. The C-LAN number also 
depends on which options that the endpoints use. It might be advantageous to segregate IP 
voice control traffic from device control traffic as a safety measure.

Circuit packs and power supplies
298
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
A CLAN socket is a software object that can connect a C-LAN to the IP Network. A simple 
calculation determines the default value for C-LAN socket usage of H.323 tie trunks. Divide the 
total number of H.323 tie trunks that use sharing by 31. Each IP endpoint requires the use of 
some number of C-LAN sockets. A C-LAN circuit pack supports a maximum of 500 sockets.
The C-LAN differs from an IP Media Processor. The difference is that the C-LAN controls the 
call, while the IP Media Processor provides the codecs that are used for the audio on the call.
To keep the firmware on the CLAN circuit pack up-to-date, you can download C-LAN firmware 
updates from the Web. To take advantage of this downloadable firmware capability, you must 
already have at least one C-LAN circuit pack in your system. You must also have access to the 
public Internet.
The C-LAN can serve as an FTP or SFTP server for file transfers — primarily firmware 
downloads.

TN802B MAPD (IP interface assembly)
The TN802 IP interface circuit pack supports voice calls and fax calls from the switch across a 
corporate intranet or the Internet. This circuit pack is still supported, but is now replaced with the 
TN2302AP IP media processor on page 310. The IP trunking software runs on an embedded 
PC that runs Windows NT. The TN802 circuit pack supports IP Solutions, including IP trunking 
and MedPro (H.323) with IP softphones.
The TN802 IP Interface operates in two modes, IP Trunk and Media Processor (MedPro/
H.323). The TN802 defaults to IP Trunk mode. To use the TN802 in MedPro mode, you activate 
it through administration to use the H.323 trunking feature. MedPro mode is necessary to 
support IP softphones.
TN1654 DS1 converter, T1 (24 channels) and E1 (32 
channels)
Note:
Note:
This circuit pack is not used in a G650 Media Gateway.
The TN1654 converter installs in place of the conventional fiber. The TN1654 converter 
supports from one to four T1 or E1 facilities. The TN1654 also provides a total of 92 T1 
channels, or 120 E1 channels. These channels run each direction between the processor port 
network (PPN) and an expansion port network (EPN). This capacity is enough for the EPN to 
easily support several hundred stations.
The switch architecture provides for EPNs that are remotely located from the PPN. An EPN that 
is within 5 miles (8 kilometers) of the PPN can be coupled using multimode fiber-optic cable. 
EPNs that are within 22 miles (35.4 kilometers) of the PPN can be coupled using single-mode 
fiber-optic cable. You must use a DS1 converter complex to connect an EPN when the distance 
between the PPN and the EPN exceeds a certain distance or private right-of-way is unavailable. 
The maximum distances are 5 miles (8 kilometers) for multimode cable, or 22 miles (35.4 km) 
for single-mode cable. One DS1 circuit pack is placed on each end of the DS1 converter 
complex.
The TN1654 DS1 converter requires a set of Y-cables to connect to a TN570B Expansion 
Interface circuit pack.

TN2184 DIOD trunk (4 ports)
Note:
Note:
This circuit pack is not used in a G650 Media Gateway.
The TN2184 is a Direct Inward/Outward Dialing (DIOD) trunk circuit pack used for Germany. 
The TN2184 circuit pack contains four port circuits. Each circuit interfaces a 2-wire analog CO 
trunk with the TDM switching network of the system. Each port allows incoming calls and 
outgoing calls to include addressing information. This information is received from the CO for 
incoming calls. Or, this addressing information is being sent to the CO for outgoing calls. The 

TN2185B ISDN-BRI S/T-TE interface (4-wire, 8 ports)
Issue 4
June 2005
303
 
TN2184 detects periodic pulse metering (PPM) signals for call-charge accounting on outgoing 
calls.
The TN2184 combines the features of a CO trunk and a DID trunk. The TN2184 provides both 
outgoing calls and incoming calls with addressing information in both directions.
TN2185B ISDN-BRI S/T-TE interface (4-wire, 8 ports)
The TN2185B supports eight 4-wire ISDN-BRI line S interfaces. Each interface operates at 
192 kbps, with two B channels (64 kbps) and one D-channel (16 kbps). The TN2185B interfaces 
to the LAN bus and to the TDM bus to provide the TE side of the BRI interface.
The TN2185B is similar to the TN2198 except that the TN2185B is a 4-wire S-interface instead 
of a 2-wire U-interface. Another difference is that the network control element (NCE) replaces 
the function of the SCOTCH/NPE and SAKI.
For each port, information communicates over two 64-kbps bearer channels called B1 and B2. 
Information also communicates over a 16-kbps channel called the demand channel, or 
D-channel. The D-channel is used for signaling. Channels B1 and B2 can be circuit-switched 
simultaneously, or either of them can be packet-switched, but not both at once. The D channel 
is always packet-switched. For voice operation, the circuit pack has a Mu-Law or A-Law option 
that applies uniformly to all circuit-switched connections on the circuit pack. The circuit-switched 
connections operate as 64-kbps clear channels when in the data mode. The packet-switched 
channels support the LAPD protocol. However, the TN2185B does not terminate on LAPD 
protocol. The S-interface does not support switching of both B channels together as a 128-kbps 
wideband channel.
The TN2185B has a maximum range up to 18,000 feet (5486 meters) from the system to the 
NT1 device. In an environment with multiple telephones, the B channels are shared only on a 
per-call basis. For example, if Channel B2 is for data, then the use of this channel by one 
telephone excludes the others from having access to Channel B2. When a device 
communicates over the D-channel to access B1 or B2, that channel is owned until the call is 
taken down. The D-channel is always shared among the terminals. The TN2185B circuit pack 
can be used as an alternative to the TN464 circuit pack or the TN2464 circuit pack.
The TN2185B supports the ability to outpulse in-band DTMF signals or end-to-end signaling.
QSIG Call Completion is supported, but QSIG Supplementary Services are not. ISDN-BRI 
trunks can be used as inter-PBX tie lines that use the QSIG peer protocol.

TN2198 ISDN-BRI U interface (2-wire, 12 ports)
The TN2198 circuit pack allows connection to the ANSI standard 2-wire U-Interface. The 2-wire 
interface from the TN2198 connects to an NT1 network interface. The 4-wire interface on the 
other side of the NT1 can connect to one or two telephones. Unlike the TN2185 circuit pack, the 
TN2198 does not provide a trunk-side interface. 
The TN2198 contains 12 ports that interface at the ISDN U reference point. For each port, 
information communicates over two 64-kbps bearer channels called B1 and B2. Information 
also communicates over a 16-kbps channel called the demand channel, or D-channel. The 
D-channel is used for signaling. Channels B1 and B2 can be circuit-switched simultaneously. 
The D-channel is always packet-switched. The TN2198 requires a packet control circuit pack. 
Each port supports one telephone, such as the 500 rotary dial analog telephone and 2500 
DTMF dial telephones.
The D-channel supports the LAPD protocol and is consistent with the CCITT Q.920 
recommendations for D-channel signaling.
In an environment with multiple telephones, the B channels are shared only on a per-call basis. 
For example, if the B2 channel is used for data, then the use of B2 by one telephone excludes 
the other telephones from having access to the B2 channel. When a device communicates over 
the D-channel to access B1 or B2, that channel is owned until the call is taken. The D channel is 
always shared among the telephones. The TN2198 interfaces with the TDM bus and the packet 
bus in the switch backplane and terminates with 12 ISDN basic access ports.
The TN2198 has a maximum range of 18,000 feet (5486 meters) from the system to the NT1 
device and uses standard protocol ANSI T1.601. The TN2198 has a 160-kbps line rate, that 
consists of:
●Two bearer channels at 64 kbps each
●A D-channel at 16 kbps
●Framing at 12 kbps
●Maintenance at 4 kbps
The TN2198 supports a maximum of 24 telephones or data modules.
The TN2198 is not offered as a BRI Tie Trunk.

The TN2199 combines the functionality of a DID trunk and a one-way outgoing CO trunk (DIOD 
trunk). To accomplish MF shuttle signaling, the TN2199 circuit pack must be combined with a 
TN744D Call Classifier circuit pack.
The TN2199 circuit pack supports incoming automatic number identification (ANI).
TN2202 ring generator
The TN2202 ring generator circuit pack is designed for use in France.
The TN2202 ring generator circuit pack supplies 50-Hz ringing power. The TN2202 supplies 
balanced ringing to telephones that connect to the TN2183 multicountry analog line circuit pack. 
A modified backplane allows this balanced ringing. The telephones must be administered for 
France analog transmission.
The TN2202 plugs into the power unit slot and is required for each carrier that contains analog 
lines. A 1-lead modification is required in a carrier backplane that uses the TN2202. This 
modification is required for all products that are made for France. The TN2202 can:
●produce two symmetric voltages (usually 28 V RMS) with respect to ground,
●take –48 VDC, –5 VDC, and ground from the backplane, and
●generate 2 × 28 V RMS with added –48 VDC.

between the server and IPSI. In this case, the network for carrying calls, the bearer path, is 
separate from the dedicated LAN for control messages. The bearer path uses the customer’s 
nondedicated LAN, a center stage switch (CSS) configuration, or an asynchronous 
transmission mode (ATM) network.
You can also configure the path for control messages to use the customer’s nondedicated LAN. 
In this case, the bearer path and control path use the same network.
ISPI capabilities
The IPSI always resides in the tone clock slot on a media gateway and uses a 10/100 BaseT 
interface to connect to:
●The server
●A laptop computer connected to the server through a services port
The IPSI provides the following functions:
●PN clock generation and synchronization for Stratum 4 type II only
●PN tone generation
●PN tone detection, global call classification, and international protocols
●Processing of product serial numbers for license file activation
●Environmental maintenance, only on a G650 Media Gateway

TN2312BP IP server interface
Issue 4
June 2005
313
 
Note:
Note:
When the TN2312BP IPSI is used in an MCC1or SCC1, a TN755D provides the 
environmental maintenance.
The IPSI can be accessed remotely using the Telnet and SSH protocols. The IPSI can serve as 
an SSH client, as well, for remote access from the IPSI to the Communication Manager server. 
The C-LAN can also serve as an FTP or SFTP server for file transfers — primarily firmware 
downloads.
Note:
Note:
The IPSI cannot serve as an SFTP client. Additionally, the SSH/SFTP capability 
is only for the control network interface, not the Services interface.
The IPSI supports the following functions and devices:
●Eight global call classification ports
●Network diagnostics
●Download of IPSI firmware updates from the Web or laptop
The TN2312BP IP server interface (IPSI) is the only IP server interface that is supported on the 
G650 Media Gateway. The TN2312BP IPSI is compatible with the following gateways:
●CMC1
●MCC1
●SCC1
●G600 
●G650 
But the TN2312BP provides environmental maintenance only when it is used in a G650 Media 
Gateway. 
IPSI support for system maintenance
A TN2312BP IPSI placed in a G650 with a carrier address set to A acts as the serial bus master. 
A TN2312BP IPSI can only be placed in a G650 with a carrier address set to A or B. Only a 
TN2312BP IPSI in a G650 with a carrier address set to A can function as an serial bus master. 
The TN2312BP IPSI also provides environmental maintenance for the G650. This includes:
●Power supply, cabinet, and ring generator maintenance
●External device alarm detection
●Emergency transfer control
●Customer-provided alarm device control

Circuit packs and power supplies
314
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
The TN2312BP IPSI and the 655A power supply provide the following information to the G650:
●Environment maintenance
- Inlet temperature of the G650
- Exhaust temperature of G650 
- Hot Spot temperature status
- Voltage, +5, -5, or -48
- Fan speed
- Fan alarm
- Ring status
- Ring control
- Ringer Setting
- Ring Detection
- Input Power, AC or DC
●External device alarm detection
The external device alarm detection uses two external leads. External devices such as an 
uninterruptible power supply (UPS) or voice messaging system can use these leads to 
generate alarms. The external device uses the Avaya Communication Manager alarm 
reporting capability. Ground potential on either of these leads results in an alarm being 
generated. You can administer the alarm level, product ID, alternate name, and alarm 
description for each lead. The alarm levels are major, minor, and warning.
●Emergency transfer control
Emergency transfer control provides -48 VDC to operate an external emergency transfer 
panel. The Communication Manager controls the state of the emergency transfer. When the 
emergency transfer is set to other than auto, an alarm is generated.
●Customer-provided alarm device (CPAD) control
CPAD provides a contact closure across a pair of external leads. These leads can control a 
customer-provided alarm device or an alarm indicator. The level of alarm can be 
administered system wide to cause a contact closure. The alarm levels are major, minor, 
warning, or none. When the alarm level matches the alarm level that was administered, the 
TN2312BP IPSI closes this contact for all G650s. This closure occurs by a carrier address 
set to A. When the TN2312BP IPSI is in emergency transfer, this contact is closed to 
activate the CPAD.
I/O adapters
The TN2312BP IPSI requires a new adapter that provides for the alarm input, CPAD, and 
emergency transfer leads. This adapter, like the existing TN2312AP IPSI adapter, also allows 
the IPSI Ethernet connection to be made to the back of the IPSI slot.

Compatibility
The TN2312BP IPSI can replace the TN2312AP IPSI in the following gateways:
●SCC1
●MCC1
●CMC1
●G600 
However, the IPSI does not provide environmental maintenance for these media gateways.
Environment maintenance requires monitoring of the AuxSig backplane lead cabinet when the 
TN2312BP is installed in a CMC1 or G600 media gateway with Communication Manager 2.0. 
This lead sends an alarm if a failure is detected in either the power supply or fan assembly. The 
CMC1 and G600 are supported only in a nondedicated control path configuration with 
Communication Manager 2.0.
See the following table for IPSI and media gateway compatibility.
Number of IPSI circuit packs per configuration
For configurations where voice bearer is over CSS or ATM, each IPSI usually controls five port 
networks. Each IPSI achieves control by tunneling control messages over the bearer network to 
PNs that do not have IPSIs. An IPSI cannot be placed in:
●A PN that has a Stratum-3 clock interface
●A remote PN that is using a DS1 converter
●A Survivable Remote Expansion Port Network (SREPN)

A simple formula determines the number of IPSI-connected PNs that should support an S8500, 
S8700, or S8710 configuration. Divide the total number of PNs in the configuration by five and 
add one. The additional IPSI provides fault tolerance. For example, if you have 20 PNs, divide 
20 by 5 to get 4, then add 1. You need a minimum of five IPSIs to support the 20 PNs. 
For configurations where voice bearer is over IP, there must be one IPSI in each PN.
A direct connect configuration only supports one IPSI-connected PN.
TN2313AP DS1 interface (24 channels)
The TN2313AP DS1 port circuit pack interfaces a DS1 trunk to the switch backplane by port 
slots that are standard for DEFINITY products. The TN2313AP is compatible with the following:
- previous 24-channel DS1 circuit packs, including the TN464F, vintage 19 and below
- TN2464,vintage 19 and below
- TN767E DS1.
Except, the TN2313AP does not provide for packet adjunct capabilities. The TN2313AP 
supports a variety of applications, including networking of the following:
- DEFINITY switches
- international trunk types
- video teleconferencing 
- wideband data transmission
On S8500, S8700, and S8710 Media Servers, this circuit pack does not directly support 
D-channel signaling and thus does not directly support ISDN-PRI connectivity. However, the 
TN767 circuit can indirectly support D-channel signaling provided that the central office 
supports nonfacility associated signaling (NFAS). In this case, use NFAS administration on the 
server to associate the D-channel of another T1/E1 circuit pack, usually a TN464, with the 
TN767 circuit pack. 
The TN2313AP DS1 interface can be configured as 24 channels at 1.544 Mbps. The TN2313 
can supply two 8-kHz reference signals to the switch backplane. These signals can be used by 
the tone-clock circuit pack to synchronize the system clock and the received line clock.
The TN2313AP is firmware downloadable.

The TN2401 Net/Pkt interface circuit pack provides the:
●network control interface (NETCON),
●packet interface (PACCON), and 
●processor interface (PI) if BX.25 connectivity is not required. 
The TN2401 communicates control channel messages between the processor circuit pack and 
the distributed network of port circuit packs on the TDM bus. The TN2401 provides eight 
asynchronous data channels that process and route information directly from the processor 
circuit pack to customer-connected equipment. The TN2401 does not include modems. The 
TN2401 is required for the SI model to save translations to the 5-volt ATA flash memory card.

TN2401/TN2400 network packet interface
complex assembly for SI upgrades
The TN2401/TN2400 network packet interface complex provides:
●A network control interface (NETCON)
●A packet interface (PACCON)
●A processor interface (PI) if BX.25 connectivity is not required
●Eight asynchronous data channels
The TN2401/TN2400 does not include modems.
The TN2401/TN2400 is required for the SI model to save translations to the 5-volt ATA flash 
memory card.
The TN2401/TN2400 complex and the TN2404 processor is required for the following 
upgrades:
●A G1 or G3iV1 MCC1 with a TN773 Processor
●An SI system with a TN786B Processor when reusing the existing control carrier cabinet
●An SI system with a TN790 or 790B Processor. Any R5 or R6 system has the old control 
carrier backplane and requires the TN2401/TN2400. R7 and R8 systems can have either 
the old control carrier backplane or the new control carrier backplane. The backplane type 
must be verified before the upgrade order is placed so that the right characteristic 
selection can be made. If the type of carrier is not known, a visual inspection of the R7 or 
R8 system is required. The old backplane is being used if the system has a TN794/
TN2400 in the network control and packet control slots. If nothing is in the packet control 
slot, the new backplane is being used.
TN2402 processor
A TN2402 processor circuit pack resides in slot one of cabinet A. The TN2402 processor 
platform runs at 25 MHz. The TN2402 includes a 32-bit RISC CPU complex and a maintenance 
processor complex that provides serial communications and maintenance functions for 
DEFINITY CSI. The TN2402 also terminates ISDN LAPD signaling over the TDM bus from PRI 
and BRI trunk circuit packs.
This circuit pack contains 32 MB of DRAM memory, which is provided by one SIMM, and 32 MB 
of flash memory. The software is stored on flash memory and on removable memory through 
flash-ROM that plugs directly into the TN2402 processor circuit pack. The flash is not 
interleaved. The memory on the processor circuit pack contains the generic program and the 
system translations. The cartridge contains a copy of the system translations and the error log.

Scenarios for blocked IP calls
There are at least four cases in which the 320 channels of a TN2602AP IP Media Resource 320 
circuit pack can cause calls to be blocked:
No shuffling: - If 160 simultaneous non-shuffled IP-station-to-IP-station calls are in progress, 
all 320 TN2602AP channels may be in use (with one two-way talk path between each of the 320 
IP stations connected to the TDM bus). While these calls only use 320 of the 484 timeslots 
available on the port network’s TDM bus, the TN2602AP circuit pack cannot handle any more 
calls over IP, so additional IP calls are blocked.
Conference calls: - If there are 106 simultaneous three-party IP-phone calls, 318 of 320 
TN2602AP channels will be in use because calls that include more than two IP endpoints 
cannot be shuffled. While these calls use only 318 of the 484 timeslots available on the port 
network’s TDM bus, the TN2602AP circuit pack cannot handle any more three-way calls over 
IP, so additional IP calls are blocked.
Music on Hold: - Each IP trunk call connected to music on hold uses a two-way talk path 
because a talk path is allocated in advance for an agent’s voice. So, although a caller is only 
listening while connected to music on hold, the call still uses a two-way channel. If there were 
320 simultaneous IP trunk calls, all 320 channels of the TN2602AP circuit pack would be used, 
even if every call were listening to the same music on hold. While these calls use only 321 of the 
484 timeslots available on the port network’s TDM bus (one path for listening to the same music 
on hold and 320 for the reserved talk paths), the TN2602AP circuit pack cannot handle any 
more calls over IP. So additional IP calls are blocked.
Announcements:  - If a large number of IP trunks can be queued to hear an announcement.  
Since there are 31 announcement timeslots per VAL board, potentially up to 453 timeslots (484 
- 31)are available to listen to announcements.  Calls could get blocked or continue to queue 
despite the fact that there are 133 (453-320) timeslots still available on the TDM bus. 
TNCCSC-1 PRI to DASS converter
The TNCCSC-1 circuit pack converts ISDN-PRI to a Direct Access Secondary Storage (DASS) 
interface. DASS is a 2-Mbps interface that uses a 75-Ohm coaxial transmission facility. One 
TNCCSC-1 circuit pack can support two TN464 DS1 interface circuit packs. A Y-cable and an 
888B 75-Ohm coaxial adapter connect to the public network facility.
TNCCSC-2 PRI to DPNSS converter
The TNCCSC-2 circuit pack converts ISDN-PRI to a Digital Private Network Signaling System 
(DPNSS) interface. DPNSS is a 2-Mbps interface that uses a 75-Ohm coaxial transmission 
facility. One TNCCSC-2 circuit pack can support two TN464 DS1 interface circuit packs. A 
Y-cable connects to the public network facility.

TNCCSC-3 PRI to DPNSS converter
Issue 4
June 2005
327
 
TNCCSC-3 PRI to DPNSS converter
The TNCCSC-3 circuit pack is the same as the TNCSSC-2 circuit pack, except that the 
TNCSSC-3 has a 120-Ohm twisted pair interface.
TN-C7 PRI to SS7 converter
The TN-C7 converter provides a gateway interface between the TN464 circuit pack and the 
public signaling network. The TN-C7 integrates DASS, DPNSS, and SS7 into a single circuit 
pack type. The TN-C7 supports international service provider call center customers. The TN-C7 
is not designed for operation in the US or Canada.
TN-CIN voice, fax, and data multiplexer
The TN-CIN Provides QSIG and private networking transparency on demand across a switched 
network. The TN-CIN integrates circuits over a single separate digital link. The circuits include 
up to three G.728 LD-CELP voice or fax circuits, six CAFT voice or fax circuits, and two data 
circuits. The three or six voice or fax circuits are presented as a G.703 E1 data stream that uses 
either QSIG peer-to-peer or channel-associated signaling.
All voice or fax circuits support low bit rate voice compression at 8 to 16 kbps when the circuits 
use CAFT. The same voice compression is supported at 16 kbps when circuits use LD-CELP. 
LD-CELP voice compression supports FAX at V.29 (7200 bps). CAFT voice compression 
supports FAX at V.27ter (4800 bps). The Composite port supports V.11 and V.35 at speeds up to 
128 kbps.
The TN-CIN features an on-demand voice networking mode for use with time-based 
communications links like ISDN. A high-speed data port is available for data applications. This 
port uses V.24 or V.11 or V.35 at up to 115.2 kbps synchronous or V.24 at up to 115.2 kbps 
asynchronous. The port also incorporates dynamic bandwidth allocation, also known as 
variable data clocking. A low-speed V.24 data port of up to 96 kbps synchronous or 57.6 kbps 
asynchronous is available for data applications.

Bantam jacks
Six bantam jacks on the faceplate of the MM710 Media Module provide access to the incoming 
and outgoing T1 signals or E1 signals:
●SM allows passive monitoring of the incoming line. 
●EM allows passive monitoring of the outgoing line. 
●SO allows intrusive monitoring of the incoming signal from the network. When used, the 
SO jack breaks the connection of that signal to the framer.
●EI allows injection of a signal towards the framer. When used, the EI jack isolates the 
network Rx signal.
●SI allows injection of a signal towards the network. When used, the SI jack isolates the 
framer Tx signal from going out to the network.
●EO allows intrusive monitoring of the signal from the framer. When used, the EO jack 
breaks the connection of that signal to the network jack RJ48C. 
LEDs
Four LEDs are supported on the faceplate. These LEDs include the three standard Media 
Module LEDs and the SIG LED that indicates that the MM710 Media Module is receiving a valid 
signal.
DB 25 DCE connector
A DB DCE connector is included and can connect a data service unit (DSU) in a future release.
Loopback jack
When your order an MM710 T1/E1 Media Module, Avaya recommends that you include the 
optional 700A loopback jack. With the loopback jack installed, you can loop back the T1 up to 
the network facility without a dispatch. If the MM710 is sold with an Avaya Service Agreement, 
the jack must be ordered and installed to save time and money on service calls.
The jack is usually used for CO trunk installations. The jack is inserted as close to the network 
or service provider T1 facility as possible. When the jack is activated from the G700 Media 
Gateway, the jack sets up loopbacks in both directions. The G700 Media Gateway can then 
send and receive a test pattern. The test pattern verifies the function of the MM710 and T1 
cable up to the network T1 facility. In normal operation, the jack passes the T1 signals through 
undisturbed in both directions.

Videoconferencing over IP
In a joint effort, Avaya and Polycom® offer IP-telephony enabled videoconferencing solutions for 
desktop and group video communication. A user can place and receive video calls on Avaya IP 
Softphone enabled with Avaya Video Integrator and Polycom® video. Video is displayed on a 
PC if a user makes or answers a video call on their Avaya IP Softphone. Both desktop to 
desktop calls and multiparty conferences can be video-enabled depending on the user’s 
components. A single IP infrastructure integrates voice, data, and video applications. A release 
of Avaya Communication Manager that is video-enabled serves the desktop video endpoints, 
room videoconference systems, and videoconferencing control units.
Videoconferencing components
The basic components for videoconferencing include the following hardware and software. 
Telephones are optional. Different configuration modes require different components. The 
videoconferencing gatekeeper is a video-enabled release of Avaya Communication Manager. 
Optional third party gatekeepers can include the Polycom® PathNavigator.
Video capable devices include the following components:
●Avaya IP Softphone with Avaya Video Integrator and Polycom® video
●Polycom® VSX family of room videoconference systems
●Polycom® MGC Multipoint Control Unit (MCU)
●Video endpoints such as:
- Polycom® Viewstation FX
- Third party H.320 video endpoints. Note that Avaya does not support these endpoints.
Hardware associated with Avaya IP Softphone can include the following components:
●PC
●Handset or headset
●USB or Polycom® ViaVideo camera
Videoconferencing connections
The IP videoconferencing components connect to the customer’s LAN which then interconnects 
all the components. Media streams between devices travel directly across the LAN. The 
streams do not traverse any of the signaling components. These components may include 
Avaya Communication Manager or a Polycom® gatekeeper. These components may have been 
used to establish the streams. 

Videoconferencing over IP

Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
Each of the video capable devices register with an H.323 gatekeeper. Avaya Communication 
Manager can be used for:
●Avaya IP Softphone with Avaya Video Integrator and Polycom® video,
●Polycom® MGC multipoint control unit, and
●Polycom® VSX. 
The gatekeeper for Polycom® Viewstation is either the Polycom® PathNavigator gatekeeper or 
a third party gatekeeper.
Other H.323 compliant audio and video devices might function in this configuration, but none 
are Avaya supported. The H.323 components connect throughthe LAN. The H.320 components 
connect through the circuit switched ISDN BRI.

●Power supplies that are designed to the IEEE 802.3af-2003 Power over Ethernet 
standard, which can include either of the following:
- Avaya PoE switches, which includes the C364T-PWR, C363T-PWR and P333T-PWR 
switches, for new Ethernet network installations. 
- The1152A1 mid-span power-distribution unit is used for configurations that use existing 
Ethernet network.
●Local power using the 1151B1 or 1151B2 power supply
Power for First Generation Avaya IP telephones (4606, 4612, and 
4624)
There are two generations of Avaya 4606, 4612, and 4624 IP telephones. The first generation 
(Gen-1) IP telephones support local power over pins 7 and 8 using the 1151B1 or 1151B2 
power supply. The second generation (Gen-2) IP telephones are designed to the IEEE 
802.3af-2003 Power over Ethernet specifications.
There are two ways to identify the first generation of an Avaya IP telephone:
●Label identification — The product label beneath an IP telephone contains a 12-character 
(US only), or 16-character (international) model number or apparatus code. The model 
number indicates the generation by either a 01A (Gen-1) or 02A (Gen-2) identifier.
●Display identification — The model for an IP telephone can be retrieved via the display 
after the telephone has been powered up.

(LAPs), combine with a Communication Manager media server and a Global System for Mobile 
Communication (GSM) cellular network to provide Seamless Communications service. 
Figure 83: W310 WLAN Gateway
An S8500, S8700, or S8710 Media Server can support a maximum of 64 W310 WLAN 
Gateways. An S8300 Media Server can support up to 50 W310 WLAN Gateways. Each W310 
WLAN Gateway can, in turn, support up to 16 W110 LAPs. One W310 WLAN Gateway can 
support up to 1024 users. However, the actual number of Seamless Communications users that 
a media server can support is limited to its SIP trunk capacities and licensing of SIP and CCS 
users.
The W310 WLAN Gateway centralizes and performs many of the functions of the access points, 
such as seamless mobility, security policy enforcements, enforcement of QOS, and the supply 
of Power over Ethernet (PoE).

Extension to Cellular and Off-PBX Station
Avaya Extension to Cellular and Off-PBX Station application types provide users with the 
capability to have one administered phone that supports Avaya Communication Manager 
features for both an office phone and one outside phone. Off-PBX Station application types 
allow users to receive and place office calls anywhere, any time. Application types are 
Extension to Cellular, Outboard Proxy SIP (OPS), Seamless Converged Communications 
Across Network (SCCAN), and Cellular Service Provider (CSP). Extension to Cellular extends 
office calls to a user’s cellular phone. CSP performs the same functions as Extension to Cellular 
but is sold to a user by their cellular service provider. CSP differs from Extension to Cellular only 
in that a user of the CSP application type cannot disable the feature. OPS is used to administer 
a SIP phone. SCCAN offers voice and data access from a single SCCAN handset that is 
integrated with a desktop phone across the corporate Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), 
public Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), and cellular networks. A user can have 
more than one application type per station.
Through all of these application types, people calling an office phone can reach users even if 
they are not in the office. This added flexibility also allows the user to access certain 
Communication Manager features from a phone that is outside the office phone network.

Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
The following Avaya phone types may be administered as the “host phone” using Extension to 
Cellular/Off-PBX Station application types:
The previously-listed phones all support the Motorola CN620 Mobile Office Device, as well as 
other wireless telephones. In support of the CN620, these desk phones may be administered 
using the Administration without Hardware feature. In this way, the actual desk phone does not 
need to be physically connected.
Except for the purchase of cellular phones and cellular service by a public service provider, 
neither you nor users need any additional hardware for use of the Extension to Cellular/Off-PBX 
Station features. You simply administer the feature on the media server running Communication 
Manager.

This switch has 48 10/100 Mbps ports with Power over Ethernet (PoE) and two GBIC SFP 
ports. 
Figure 89: C364T-PWR Converged Stackable switch
A C360 switch can coreside in a stack with G700 media gateways and with selected P330 
switches. A C360 stack can contain up to 10 switches and up to three backup power supply 
units. The stacked switches connect using the stacking submodules that plug into a slot in the 
back of the C360. The X330RC cable connects the top and bottom switches in the stack and 
provides redundancy and hot-swappability. This characteristic is similar to how modules can be 
swapped in a modular switching chassis.
Avaya C360 switches are multilayer switches and can be upgraded with a license to provide 
routing (Layer3) functionality.

Rack mounting, temperature and humidity information
for the G600 Media Gateway
Rack mounting
The G600 Media Gateway can be mounted in a standard 19-inch (48 centimeter) data rack that 
is preinstalled and secured according to the EIA 464 or equivalent standards. The G600 Media 
Gateway can be front mounted as shipped or mounted at its midpoint.
The customer must provide the rack, and the rack must be installed and secured prior to the 
G600 Media Gateway installation. The customer must also provide AC power to the rack. The 
technicians who install the G600 Media Gateway do not usually have the tools or proper training 
for data rack installation.
Installation requires 1 foot (30 centimeters) of clearance in the rear, and 18 inches (45 
centimeters) of clearance in the front, which is consistent with the EIA 310 standards. In a 
2-cabinet configuration, the dimensions of the TDM/LAN cable require that you mount the B 
cabinet directly over the A cabinet.
Temperature and humidity
The G600 Media Gateway must be installed in a well-ventilated area. Maximum equipment 
performance is achieved at an ambient temperature between 40 °F and 120 °F (4 °C and 49 °C) 
for a short-term operation of not more then 72 consecutive hours or 15 days in one year. A 
continuous operation requires up to 110 °F (43 °C).
The relative humidity range is 10 to 95% at up to 84 °F (29 °C). Above 84 °F (29 °C), maximum 
relative humidity decreases from 95% to 32% at 120 °F (49 °C). Installations outside these limits 
might reduce system life or affect operation. The recommended temperature range and 
humidity range is 65 °F to 85 °F (18 °C to 29 °C) at 20 to 60% relative humidity.

Heat dissipation for the G600 Media Gateway
The following table describes the amount of heat dissipation that is required by a G600 Media 
Gateway configuration. These estimates are dependent on the inclusion of telephones with the 
media gateways and the amount of time that the telephones are off-hook.
Note:
Note:
Typical systems assume typical trunking, sparing, call rate, and a typical mixture 
of high-function telephones and low function telephones. Worst-case systems 
assumes typical trunking and call rate, but no spare slots, and all ports configured 
with high-function terminals. The G600 Media Gateway that was tested used the 
worst case of 16 port analog circuit packs that were fully populated with analog 
sets.

Environmental considerations for the G700 Media Gateway
The following table lists the environmental considerations for the G700 Media Gateway.
.
Consideration
Description
Heat dissipation
The G700 Media Gateway uses global AC, 100 VAC to 240 
VAC, 50/60 Hz, 1.5 to 4.9 A, which translates to 360 to 400 
Watts. However, some heat is passed out the front, by -48 
VDC (up to 32 ports at 1.5 watts each for a total of 48 watts).
Altitude
Functions at altitudes of minus 197 feet (60 meters) to 10,000 
feet (3,048 meters). 
Air pressure
Air pressure is not specified.
Temperature and humidity
Long-term operation at 41 °F (+5 °C) to 104 °F (+40 °C) at 5% 
to 85% humidity. Short term operation at 23 °F (-5 °C) to 122 
°F (50 °C), at 5% to 90% humidity, noncondensing.
Air purity
Requires an indoor environment that is suitable for continuous 
human occupancy.
Lightning
The user is protected under the UL codes against over voltage 
in the system. However, the system itself is susceptible to over 
voltage, such as lightning, depending on the configuration. The 
loss of service because of an over voltage condition can result 
in the loss of one or more of the following elements:
●Terminal loss
●Port loss
●Media Module loss
●Power supply within the G700
Acoustic noise generated
50 dBA maximum
Electromagnetic 
compatibility standards
Conforms to the electromagnetic compatibility standards for 
the countries in which it operates.
European union standards
Approved to Safety Standard EN60950.
Air flow with a single fan 
failure
In front of the backplane, airflow is 264 linear feet per minute 
average. If a fan fails in front of the backplane, airflow 
becomes 174 lfpm average, with a range from 42 to 340 lfpm.
Air flow with the power 
supply fan failure
Minimal air flow at power supply if power supply fan fails.

Power requirements for the G700 Media Gateway
Issue 4
June 2005
451
 
Power requirements for the G700 Media Gateway
The power supply complies with FCC Part 15, Subpart B Class B and EN55022 Class B 
requirements for conducted and radiated electromagnetic interferences (EMI). You can use the 
power supply in single or multiple G700 Media Gateways. The power supply must allow the 
system to comply with Class B requirements with +6 dB of margin.
This power unit can be a single power supply or multiple modules that are sized and scalable for 
the load. The Avaya Ethernet switches have a power unit that meets the 802.3 AF standard and 
provides remote power for the telephone. The power supply meets all applicable global 
standards for safety, immunity, and emissions, and is verified by in-country testing.
Thermal protection
Thermal protection shuts down the power supply if the internal temperature exceeds the 
maximum rated safe operating temperature. The minimum thermal shutdown point is at an 
ambient temperature of 122 °F (50° C) at 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) elevation or 140 °F (60° C) 
at sea level. These temperature minimums are constant under all input and load conditions. You 
must consider the effects of component tolerances when you define the shutdown point. This 
consideration ensures that the supply does not shut down at ambient temperatures that are less 
than those previously specified. This ambient temperature is measured with a forced air flow 
from input to output at a nominal rate of 46 cubic feet (1.3 cubic meters) per minute (CFM) or 
300 linear feet (91.4 linear meters) per minute (LFM).
Manual reset
The power supply requires a manual reset after the power supply shuts down because of over 
voltage or overheating. To reset the power supply, recycle the AC input power.
AC and load center circuit breakers
For AC power, each of the G700 Media Gateways has a detachable AC power cord. This cord 
plugs into a wall socket or into a power strip on the rack. A circuit breaker for the panel that 
serves the outlet protects this circuit.
As a result, the G700 Media Gateway itself does not have circuit breakers or on/off switches. 
However, any customer AC load center must have circuit breakers that protect the power feeds 
to the G700 Media Gateways as required by electrical codes.

452
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
AC power distribution
AC power distribution is plugged into an outlet or a power strip and can be backed up by an 
optional uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
AC grounding
The G700 Media Gateway contains a grounding screw on the back of the chassis. You must 
maintain ground connection whether you connect the G700 Media Gateway directly to the 
branch circuit or to a power distribution strip. The G700 Media Gateway also requires a cabinet 
ground connection directly to an approved ground.

Altitude, air pressure and air purity for the S8700
Media Server or S8710 Media Server
The normal operating air pressure for the S8700/S8710 Media Server ranges from 9.4 pounds 
per square inch (psi) to 15.2 psi (648 millibars to 1048 millibars). For altitudes above 5,000 feet 
(1,525 meters), you must reduce the maximum short-term temperature. Reduce this 
temperature limit by 1 oF (1.8 oC) for every 1,000 feet (304.8 meters) of elevation above 5,000 
feet (1,525 meters). At 10,000 feet (3,048 meters), for example, the maximum short-term 
temperature limit is 115 oF (46.1 oC).
Air purity
Do not install the equipment in an area where it might be exposed to any of the following 
contaminants: 
●Excessive amounts of
- dust
- lint
- carbon particles
- paper fiber contaminants
- metallic contaminants
●Corrosive gases, such as sulfur and chlorine
Avaya recommends that the S8700/S8710 Media Server and related equipment not be 
collocated with copiers, printers, or plain paper fax machines. These devices produce excessive 
amounts of fine dust.

Site requirements for DEFINITY
Altitude, air pressure, and air purity for DEFINITY
Altitude and air pressure
For altitudes above 5,000 feet (1,525 meters), you must reduce the maximum short-term 
temperature. Reduce this temperature limit by 1 oF (1.8 oC) for every 1,000 feet (304.8 meters) 
of elevation above 5,000 feet (1,525 meters). For example, at sea level, the maximum 
short-term temperature limit is 120 oF (49 oC). At 10,000 feet (3,050 meters), the maximum 
short-term temperature limit is 115 oF (46 oC).
The normal operating air pressure range is 9.4 to 15.2 pounds per square inch (psi) (648 to 
1,048 millibars).
Air purity
The CMC1, SCC1, and MCC1 Media Gateways contain an air filter to reduce the flow of 
particulates through the equipment. Do not install the equipment in an area where it might be 
exposed to excessive amounts of any of the following contaminants: 
- dust
- lint
- carbon particles
- paper fiber contaminants
- metallic contaminants
For example, do not install the cabinet near paper handling equipment such as copiers and 
high-speed printers, which introduce paper dust and print particles into the environment. Avoid 
Corrosive gases above the levels in the following table.

Temperature and humidity for DEFINITY
Install the DEFINITY equipment in a well-ventilated area. Maximum equipment performance is 
obtained at an ambient room temperature up to 110 oF (43 oC) for continuous operation and 
between 40 °F and 120 oF (4 oC and 49 oC) for short term operation. Short term operation is not 
more than 72 consecutive hours or 15 days in a year.
The relative humidity range is 10% to 95% at up to 84 oF (29 oC). Above 84 oF, the maximum 
relative humidity decreases from 95% down to 32% at 120 oF (49 oC). Installations outside 
these limits might reduce system life or impede operations. The recommended temperature and 
humidity range is 65 oF to 85 oF (18oC to 29 oC) at 20 to 60% relative humidity.

Power requirements
This section describes AC power and DC power source requirements for the cabinet.
Global AC MCC power supply
The Global MCC (GMCC) power supply is for use in both US and international systems. The 
GMCC replaces the existing AC MCC1 cabinet configuration which is used in the US. This 
replacement reduces the number of power supplies and distribution units that are associated 
with the MCC1 platform.
The GMCC automatically accepts 200 VAC to 240 VAC power at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. The GMCC 
complies with all emissions and safety requirements for customer applications worldwide. The 
GMCC power system consists of:
●An NP850 rectifier that consists of cabinet-level power units located in the 
power-distribution unit at the bottom of the MCC1
●649A power supplies the DC-to-DC converters that provide carrier-level power
●One battery interface and alarm unit
●Battery connections
●Alarm outputs
●One cabinet input cord, NEMA 6-30P in the US
The GMCC power architecture offers both short-term and long-term power backup. Batteries 
inside the MCC1 provide short-term backup. External battery cabinets provide long-term 
backup. Therefore, the GMCC significantly reduces or eliminates the need for UPS and DC 
battery plants for most customer applications.
AC power
Power feeders from a dedicated power source that is usually located outside the building 
connect to an AC load center. These feeders do not provide power to other equipment. The AC 
load center distributes the power to receptacles. The power cords from the AC power 
distribution unit in each MCC1 and the AC power supply in each SCC1 plugs into a receptacle.
60-Hz power sources
Each of the following power sources can supply 60-Hz power to the AC load. The following 
figures contain information on 120-VAC to 240-VAC power sources.

The optional battery charger sits at the bottom of some MCC1s.
Figure 95: Battery charger (optional part of J58890CE-2) (front)
The battery charger is used only without an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The charger 
contains:
●Three 48-VDC batteries for backup power to the cabinet
●A DC power relay to connect the batteries into the power circuit if a main power failure is 
detected
Circuit breaker
The circuit breaker protects the AC input power to the cabinet and serves as the main AC input 
disconnect switch. The circuit breaker has two poles for 120 VAC or three poles for 208 VAC or 
240 VAC. If a problem develops, the circuit breaker automatically opens and removes the AC 
power input.
48-VDC batteries
The three series-connected 48-VDC batteries produce a nominal 144 VDC that is fused at 20 A. 
The batteries are trickle-charged from the battery charger.
Battery charger
When AC power restores after an outage, the battery charger converts a 120-VAC input to a DC 
voltage that recharges the batteries. The batteries usually recharge within 24 hours.
Batteries

DC power relay
The DC power relay disconnects the batteries from a system that is using AC power. The relay 
also disconnects the batteries if power fails for more than:
●10 minutes in a standard-reliability system
●5 minutes in high reliability and critical reliability systems
●10 minutes in an expansion port network (EPN)
The DC power relay protects the batteries from over discharging.
EMI filters
The Electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters suppress noise voltage on the AC input line to the 
MCC1 cabinet.
Ring generator
The ring generator converts the -48 VDC input to a 67-VAC to 100-VAC, 20-Hz or 25-Hz ringing 
voltage. The analog line circuit packs use this AC voltage output to ring telephones. The AC 
outputs are routed from the ring generator to port carriers, expansion control carriers, and 
control carriers.
Fuses
20-A fuses protect the power in each cable that goes from the AC power distribution unit to 
power converters in the carriers.
The following figure shows AC power distribution in some MCC1s. The DC power distribution 
cables are on both sides of the cabinet. These cables supply power to each of the carriers. The 
optional battery charger is at the right side of the power distribution unit.

Power backup
If AC power fails, three 48-VDC batteries power the system for:
●10 seconds in a PPN cabinet
●15 seconds in an EPN cabinet
●10 minutes in the control carrier of a standard reliability system
●5 minutes in a control carrier of a high reliability or critical reliability system
●10 minutes in the expansion control carrier in the A position of an EPN cabinet 
UPS
An external, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) provides a longer backup time than holdover 
batteries. These batteries have holdover times that vary from less than 10 minutes to up to 8 
hours. The UPS can replace the batteries and the battery charger. The UPS connects from the 
AC power source to a AC power cord on the cabinet. If AC power fails, the UPS supplies its own 
AC power to the cabinet.
AC power-distribution unit (J58890CH-1)
The following figure shows a typical AC power-distribution unit that is used in some MCC1 
cabinets. The AC power-distribution unit sits at the bottom of an MCC1 cabinet.

Power backup
Two types of battery assemblies are used for power backup: small and large. The small 
batteries are usually located at the center rear of a MCC1 gateway. The large batteries are 
usually located inside the battery cabinet.
Small batteries
The small batteries are an 8 Amp-hour batteries that are fused for short circuit protection and 
charged by the J58890CH-1. The batteries also contain a thermal sensor that changes the 
charging voltage depending on battery temperature. 
The small batteries provide short-term battery holdover. If AC power fails, 48 VDC batteries 
supply system power for:
●10 seconds in a PPN cabinet
●15 seconds in an EPN cabinet
●10 minutes in the control carrier in a standard reliability system
●5 minutes in the control carrier in high reliability and critical reliability systems
●10 minutes in the expansion control carrier that resides in the A position of an EPN cabinet
The following figure shows an example of the small batteries.

Large batteries
The large batteries provide holdover times of 2 to 8 hours, depending on the number of 
batteries. To use large battery holdover, one battery cabinet is required per system. The 24-cell 
battery cabinet must have a float voltage of 54.2-VDC. The 23-cell battery cabinet must have a 
float voltage of 51.75 VDC. A circuit breaker protects the batteries. The J58890CH-1 charges 
the batteries.
The batteries also contain a thermal sensor that changes the charging voltage, depending on 
the battery temperature. The following table shows the battery holdover and recharge times for 
a typical 2500-watt load.

Ground isolation
Each peripheral device that is connected to a system by the asynchronous (EIA) RS-232 
interface requires either a 105C, a 105D, or a 116A isolator interface. The interface isolates 
ground between the system and external adjuncts.
The isolator interface sits behind a processor port network (PPN) control carrier or behind an 
expansion port network (EPN) expansion control carrier. The isolator interface is installed at the 
RS-232 interface between the peripheral equipment and the interface connector.

Approved floor grounds
!
WARNING:
WARNING:
If you can only access the approved ground from within a dedicated power 
equipment room, then a licensed electrician must make the connections.
Approved floor grounds are grounds on each floor of a high-rise building. These grounds can be 
connected to the ground terminal in the riser closet and to the cabinet equipment that are 
single-point ground terminals. Approved floor grounds might include the following grounds: 
●Building steel
●The grounding conductor for the secondary side of the power transformer that feeds the 
floor 
●Metallic water pipes
●Power feed metallic conduit that supplies panel boards on the floor 
●A point that is specifically provided in the building design for grounding 
Note:
Note:
You must ensure that you electrically connect all protective grounds together to 
form a single grounding electrode system.
Coupled bonding conductor
When you use a coupled bonding conductor (CBC) grounding in an AC-powered cabinet, 
maintain a minimum space of 1 foot (0.3 meters) between the CBC power and other power and 
ground leads.

SCC1 power systems
Each SCC1 has one AC power supply or one DC power supply. These power supplies distribute 
DC power and AC ringing voltage to the circuit pack slots in the cabinet.
AC power supply (1217A)
In an AC-powered cabinet, the power supply slot contains a single, plug-in, multioutput AC 
power supply. A power cord, with a three-prong plug on one end and an appliance connector on 
the other end, connects the supply to a dedicated AC power source.
The 1217A power supply is a global power unit for SCC1s. The 1217A power supply has a wide 
input voltage operating range of 90 VAC to 264 VAC and a 50 Hz or 60 Hz autoranging input. A 
multioutput power supply also provides regulated DC output. The 1217A also has a selectable 
20 or 25 Hz AC ringer.
The 1217A power supply uses one of the following inputs, depending on the version:
●120-VAC, 60-Hz, 15-A to 20-A with three wires in the power cord: one hot wire, one neutral 
wire, and one ground wire
●220-VAC or 240-VAC, 50-Hz, 10-A with three wires in the power cord: one hot wire, one 
neutral wire, and one ground wire
The AC power supply produces the following DC outputs: +5 VDC, –5 VDC, –48 VDC, +12 
VDC, and a battery-charging voltage. The DC outputs distribute power in the cabinet backplane 
to the circuit pack slots. Additionally, the -48 VDC output current is 0 A to 8.25 A. 
A holdover circuit in the power supply allows a system to operate normally during AC power 
interruptions. If AC input power fails, reserve batteries supply power to the memory and the 
processor circuit packs and the fans for 2 minutes. All port circuit packs are inactive during this 
time. The power supply contains a battery charger to charge the holdover batteries.
DC power supply (676C)
In a DC-powered SCC, the power slots contain a single, plug-in multioutput DC power supply.
The 676C DC power supply has a wide input voltage operating range of -42 VDC to -60 VDC at 
up to 22 A. The 676C power supply produces the following outputs: 
●+5.1 VDC at 0 to 55 A
●-5.1 VDC at 0 to 5.5A
●+12 VDC at 0 to 2 A (surge to 2.8 A for 350 ms)
●-48 VDC at 0 to 8.25 A. 
The outputs distribute power on the cabinet backplane to the slots for the circuit packs. The 
value and the frequency of the AC ringing voltage output value depend on the country of use. 
The power supply has circuit breakers and EMI filtering.

DC power-distribution unit (J58890CG)
The J58890CG is used with SCC1s. Individual DC output connectors can provide power for up 
to four SCC1s. Each output connector is separately fused at 25 A. The fuses are inside the DC 
power-distribution unit. The input for the DC distribution unit is from the DC power cabinet.
Use the J58890CG DC power-distribution unit when the distance between the DC power 
cabinet and the cabinet stack is greater than 30 feet (9 meters).
Enhanced DC rectifier cabinet (J58890R)
The J58890R enhanced DC rectifier cabinet is used with SCC1s. Each rectifier assembly in the 
DC rectifier cabinet can supply up to 50 A of DC current. You can install a minimum of two 
rectifiers in each DC cabinet to supply a total of 100 A. A third rectifier assembly is used as a 
backup only.
Each SCC1 can draw up to 15 A. Up to three DC cabinets can be stacked to supply power to 
single-carrier cabinets stacks.
Each output connector is separately fused at 25 A. The fuses are inside each DC rectifier 
assembly.
Note:
Note:
A J58890CG DC power-distribution unit is required if the distance between the 
DC cabinet and the cabinet stack is greater than 30 feet (9 meters).
CMC1 AC power supply (650A)
In the CMC1, a power cord with a three-prong plug on one end and an appliance connector on 
the other end connects the supply to a dedicated AC power source. The power supply is an AC/
DC converter that is corrected for global power factors. The converter provides multiple DC 
outputs and AC ring outputs. The converter is autoranging
●85 to 264 VAC, 47 to 63 Hz, at 330 Watts, 
●4.5 A (100 VAC to 120 VAC) at 500 VA,
●or 2.3 A (200 VAC to 240 VAC) at 500 VA.
The inputs to the power supply can be:
●120 VAC, 50 Hz to 60 Hz, 6 A, with 3 wires in the power cord: 1 hot wire, 1 neutral wire, 
and 1 ground wire
●220 VAC or 240 VAC, 50 Hz to 60 Hz, 3 A, with 3 wires in the power cord: 1 hot wire, 1 
neutral wire, and 1 ground wire
The AC power supply produces the following outputs: +5 VDC, –5 VDC, and –48 VDC. The 
outputs distribute power on the cabinet backplane to the circuit pack slots. The AC ringing 
voltage output value and frequency depend on the country of use. The 650A also supplies 
power at 150 VDC for neon message waiting lamps. The power supply has EMI filtering.

Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
CMC1 UPS
The uninterruptible power supply (UPS) provides surge protection for all connected cabinets.
Connect the UPS to an electrical outlet that can handle the power requirements of all cabinets. 
To calculate the number of amps drawn, use the following formulas.
●For 100 VAC to 200 VAC, multiply 3.5 A times the number of cabinets.
●For 200 VAC to 240 VAC, multiply 1.8 A times the number of cabinets.
Cabinet A (control carrier) is always connected to an unswitched or always on electrical outlet 
on the UPS.
Cabinet cooling fans
CMC1 fan unit
Two variable-speed fans are at the bottom of the cabinet. The fans receive +8 VDC to +14 VDC 
from the power supply. An air filter, which can be removed and cleaned or replaced, is located 
above the fans. Outside air flows into the bottom of the cabinet. It then flows around the circuit 
packs, and out through the top of the cabinet.
If the cabinet temperature reaches 158 oF (70 oC), the temperature sensor in the power supply 
shuts the system down and invokes the emergency transfer.
MCC1 fans
A fan unit that consists of six fans is mounted near the center of the cabinet. The three front fans 
blow up, and the three rear fans blow down. A removable air filter is provided on top and below 
each fan unit. Four sensors monitor the cabinet temperature. Three sensors are inside the 
cabinet top and one sensor is inside the cabinet bottom. One of the top sensors affects the 
speed of the front fans and the bottom sensor affects the speed of the rear fans. A speed control 
and thermal alarm circuit in each fan monitors the sensors. When a sensor indicates a change 
in cabinet temperature, the circuit in a fan changes the speed for that fan.
A power cable from the power-distribution unit connects
●-48 VDC to each fan, 
●+5 VDC to the speed control and thermal alarm circuit in each fan, and 
●temperature sensor signals to the equivalent circuit in each fan. 
One pair of wires is routed to each fan circuit. A minor alarm is triggered if the speed of any fan 
drops below minimum. The minor alarms are sent to the processor circuit pack in the PPN 
cabinet and to the maintenance circuit pack in an EPN cabinet. Alarm signals are also routed to 
the equivalent circuit in each fan. One pair of wires is routed to each fan circuit.

Power requirements
Issue 4

A minor alarm occurs if a fan stops because of a loss of -48 VDC. One of the cabinet top 
thermal sensors sends an alarm if the exhaust temperature reaches 149 oF (65 oC).
Another cabinet top sensor senses if the exhaust temperature reaches 158 oF (70 oC). If the 
temperature reaches 158 oF the system shuts down, and the Emergency Transfer is invoked.
SCC1 fan unit
Four constant-speed fans at the top rear of the cabinet receive -48 VDC from the backplane. An 
air filter is located below the fan unit. Air flows down through the filter over the circuit packs. The 
filter is removable and can be cleaned or replaced when necessary.
If the cabinet temperature reaches 158 oF (70 oC), the temperature sensor in the power supply 
causes the system to shut down. The temperature sensor also invokes the Emergency 
Transfer.
System protection
The following types of system protection are provided to keep the switch active and online:
●Over voltage
●Sneak current
●Lightning
●Earthquake
Protection from hazardous voltages
Protection from hazardous voltages and currents is required for all off-premises trunks, lines, 
and terminal installations. Both sneak current protection and over-voltage protection from 
lightning, power induction, and so on, are required.
Overvoltage protection
The following devices protect the system from over voltages:
●Analog trunks use the 507B Sneak Protector. The local telephone company usually 
provides over voltage protection.
●Analog voice and 2-wire DCP terminals can use one of the following types of combined 
protection against over voltage and sneak current. The terminals can also use the 
equivalent of one of the following types:
- Carbon block with heat coil for UL code 4B1C
- Gas tube with heat coil for UL code 4B1E-W
- Solid state with heat coil for UL code 4C1S

488
Hardware Guide for Avaya Communication Manager
 
●DCP and ISDN-BRI terminals use the solid state 4C3S-75 with heat coil protector, or 
equivalent.
●DS1, E1, and T1 circuits require isolation from exposed facilities. A CSU (T1), lightwave 
integration unit (E1), or other equipment provides this isolation.
Sneak current protection
Extraneous power induces sneak current protection to protect building wiring with fuses. The 
fuses protect wiring between the network interface and trunk circuits. The fuses also protect the 
circuit packs.
All incoming trunks and outgoing trunks and off-premises station lines pass through the sneak 
fuses. 507B sneak fuse panels are installed on the system side of the network interface.
Sneak current protectors must be either UL-listed or CSA-certified or must comply with local 
safety standards. Sneak current protectors must have a maximum rating of 350 milliamperes 
(mA) and a minimum voltage rating of 600 volts, or as required by local regulations.
Lightning protection
A coupled bonding conductor (CBC) in the cabinet ground wiring protects the system from 
lightning. The CBC runs adjacent to wires in a cable and causes mutual coupling between itself 
and the wires. The mutual coupling reduces the voltage difference between ground and the 
switch.
Ensure that the CBC connects to a telecommunications cable that is firmly connected to an 
approved ground. In multiple-story buildings, you must connect the CBC to an approved ground 
at each floor.
The CBC can be any of the following configurations:
●a 10 AWG (5.3 millimeters2/2.6 millimeters) ground wire,
●a continuous cable sheath that surrounds wires within a cable, or 
●six unused pairs of wire within a cable that are twisted and soldered together. 
The CBC connects from the cabinet single-point ground bar in an AC-powered cabinet or the 
ground discharge bar in a DC-powered cabinet to the terminal bar at the cross-connect field.
When there is an auxiliary cabinet, a 6 AWG (13.3 millimeters2/4.1 millimeters) wire connects 
the system cabinet single-point ground block to the Auxiliary cabinet ground block. The ground 
wire routes as closely as possible to the cables that connect the system cabinet to the Auxiliary 
cabinet.
If equipment is not present in the Auxiliary cabinet, you must preserve ground integrity. Plug the 
power supply for this equipment into one of the two convenience outlets on the rear of the 
MCC1. The convenience outlets are fused at 5 A. A dedicated maintenance terminal plugs into 
the other convenience outlet.
