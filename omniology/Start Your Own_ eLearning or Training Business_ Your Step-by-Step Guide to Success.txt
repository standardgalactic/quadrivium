E
urope and the United States have embraced “correspon­
dence education” since the mid-19th century. Women 
in particular were encouraged to study at home. An 
online article (untitled) on the history of distance learning by 
the Interactive Media Lab/University of Florida, says that by the 
early 20th century along with the delivery of educational materi­
als through the postal service came “instructional radio.” While 
getting an education via radio never quite caught on, digital 
applications at the other end of that century—what we know as 
“eLearning”—has become the next dimension of distance learn­
ing. Not only is it a success by any measure, the industry is still in 
its infancy making it a perfect entrepreneurial opportunity.

In Start Your Own eLearning and Training Business, we show you how to become part 
of that success story and that upward trajectory. And the story has many chapters—being 
involved with eLearning can range from teaching your own classes via the internet, put­
ting together an online learning program, or being in the behind-the-scenes part of the 
industry working with the platforms that make remote education possible. You can train 
military personnel, children, the corporate workforce, or the individual looking for per­
sonal enrichment. As usual in entrepreneurship, the world is your oyster! 
The junction where great technological advancements meet innovative educators and 
groundbreaking insights into learning psychology is where distance learning is today. And 
that means while wide open and potentially lucrative, like any startup business, starting 
your own eLearning business is not for the faint of heart. The distance learning profes­
sionals interviewed for this book stressed the importance of defining your top-quality 
product and competitive edge against thinly built products that are looking to jump onto 
the crowded online education bus. With easy access to setting up a business structure and 
a do-it-yourself website, the internet is teeming with people who want to be in the distance 
learning business.  
But despite being crowded, this is a fast-paced marketplace; for those who have excit­
ing ideas, there is a rich field of opportunity with talented people who can help you, fund 
you, inspire you, and mentor you. And students of life are awaiting the next development 
in this industry, rapidly consuming all of what is offered to them. It’s clear that eLearning 
methods are holding their own and even dominating some areas of traditional education, 
such as in retention levels with self-paced learning.
As with an entrepreneurial startup that has a strong work-from-home or at least 
work independently slant, the eLearning world has become increasingly sophisticated in 
reaching out to a widespread community and providing opportunities for comradery and 
collegial interaction with others in the industry. For example, the United States Distance 
Learning Association offers a conference and comprehensive website where support and 
information through membership can enhance any online educator’s experience. They 
claim to focus on being working professionals not educational theorists—real-world solu­
tions opposed to educational jargon. This is a community where, they say, the college pro­
fessor is open to the potential of learning something from the elementary school teacher. 
Widespread internet use has proven that we can get and give information as quickly as 
we think of it. Rapid ascent of the use of mobile devices has replaced much of the stationary 
exchange of global information to add a whole new element to instant learning—“roving 
education” is now a trend! Although it may seem almost impossible to keep up with the 
latest in this ever-changing industry, what you, the potential eLearning entrepreneur, need

to focus on is thoughtful, quality development of distance education and how to offer it to 
the right audiences via the best medium at the moment.
A maturing industry offers some perspective and opportunity to analyze where we 
have been and where we should go. Innovators are changing the way we think about 
eLearning by bringing decades-long ideas to fruition with timing that strikes while tech­
nology is hot, and delivering them to an audience that is ready to devour the best that 
comes along. Use the industry tools mentioned throughout this book to keep abreast of the 
next new thing and jump on board when the time is right for your product and the learn­
ers you have chosen to target. Don’t let the rapid-changing technology scare you—adapt 
or not, and as quickly or slowly as your market seems to respond. After all, despite the 
saturation of electronic devices through almost all demographics, pencils and paper are 
still made and sold! A solid foundational tool will outlast fads and trends.
You’ll be able to test what other educators are creating and form opinions about their 
products as you use them to get seasoned, certified, and ready for business. If you wish to 
get your feet wet working for an existing educational product, a resounding “no” was the 
answer when we asked distance educators whether standard degrees and qualifications 
determine whom they hire and work with. Professionals in this field seem to be a rich col­
lage of life experiences rather than just standard degrees on a resume, which means that if 
you have the right skills and a self-propelled drive for knowledge, you can thrive. 
This is a perfect industry in which you can start slow and build. No need to jump out 
of the box with massive startup debt. Using the wisdom in the upcoming pages, you can 
create and focus on your own custom plan. Step-by-measured-step using educated, calcu­
lated moves, you can move beyond the intimidation phase and surface as a key player in 
this exciting, evolving arena!

S
tudents of life are thriving on the technological 
advancements that allow them to absorb infor­
mation efficiently with a whole host of advan­
tages over primarily attending physical, actual classrooms. 
Distance learning focuses on brain-to-brain transmission of 
information, allowing learners to save time and money. But 
where is the place for in-person learning after we embrace

the light speed at which information is gleaned for better, more, and most current infor­
mation? The fusion of face-to-face and distance learning is a fine art and there is a place 
for both. Each compliments the other and brings to the table qualities the other cannot 
for an end result that is better than each alone. Adapting the latest technology to the most 
recent understandings of the way people learn and creating courses that are an appropri­
ate, balanced mix of simulation and tangible experience is what makes distance training 
today so exciting and limitless.
Distance Learning Needs
Who can benefit from online learning? The answer is any person with an internet connection 
and computer, wanting to enrich his or her life with a skill or bit of knowledge. Calculus, the 
newest club scene dance moves, making gluten-free bread, preparing for SATs, corporate 
sexual harassment procedures, earning an MBA, food safety, writing a screenplay, mortuary 
science, witchcraft, smart investing, and programming languages are just the beginning of 
an endless list. 
You, as an eLearning professional, can also benefit enormously from the growing 
interest in self-improvement and the public’s desire to attain higher education degrees 
and training certifications. Not only will you learn from the research you’ll need to do to 
constantly improve your coursework, you’ll also learn from the wide array of context in 
which you’ll teach and, of course, from what each student brings to the table.
EdTech Distilled
Educational technology, otherwise known as “EdTech,” is the rapidly developing field dedicated 
to improving and promoting education through the development of tools such as software, 
hardware, and teaching processes. It is the mate of distance learning. It combines the skills of 
high-art technical minds and educators who excel in disseminating knowledge to bring ever 
more improved ways for students to receive education. It layers face-to-face assistance from 
great minds in education with online mentorship and learning games programmed to adapt 
and customize as learners navigate through its systems.
EdTech is advancing and developing trends and tools in each of the main four markets of 
distance learning: children and young adult education, higher education, corporate training and 
professional development, and personal enrichment courses.

More than ever, learning at the pace of the student—
whether that student is striving for an advanced degree, 
corporate or technical skill, or personal enrichment—is 
very appealing as the pace of absorbing information 
quickens and our conditioning to convenience grows. 
Combining training methods and matching each to 
the venue that is most practical and sensible for it 
makes for higher quality learning than can be achieved 
only in person; saving time by watching a technical 
demonstration video from home rather than driving to 
see an instructor give the demo serves to budget room 
for those things that are best experienced in person, such 
as interactive lectures and forums that involve subtly 
nuanced contributions of everyone in the room. Being 
able to view certain parts of a self-paced (asynchronous) 
lesson over and over customizes the lesson to the student and can reduce stress and increase 
absorption, allowing learners to achieve higher scores on tests.
Feed the Need
People are being conditioned by the fast pace of digital communication and quick 
absorption of facts when they want them, and there 
is pressure to be aware of more and more information 
as it becomes available. Mobile devices are being used 
both purposefully and on the fly to complete whole or 
segments of courses as they continue to be the dominant 
online platform. “MLearning,” or mobile learning, is 
also forecasted to be the dominant way people choose to 
engage in distance learning. Employers expect further 
education to save them time and money with employees’ 
improved efficiency. Children and young adults are 
naturals at learning new technologies and schools that 
implement distance learning capabilities afford them a 
chance to excel further than with traditional classrooms 
alone, with the ability to access information across the 
world with the click of the mouse. Income-challenged

and rural students sometimes attend schools with limited offerings and distance learning 
can bring a gifted student advanced courses her school may not offer, or supplemental 
courses to homeschoolers.
Adults and children with leisure time and a budget to enjoy it are opting for personal 
enrichment through distance learning in many areas. Making art and art appreciation, social

just some of the areas learners are seeking fun and stimulation online. Adults often go back 
The Future of eLearning Design
It’s in the fate of the numbers. Learning can be had on a train, on a plane, at a bus stop, or in 
a hospital bed with those precious waiting moments we all have. Gartner, Inc., a technology 
research company, says mobile phones are expected to dominate overall device shipments and 
forecasts 2015 purchasing numbers of computer and other mobile devices as follows:
P	PC (desk and notebook): 268,491
P	Ultra mobile tablets: 324,565
P	Mobile phones: 1,964,788
P	Hybrid and clamshell mobiles: 63,835
Forecasted 2015 numbers of shipments by operating system tell another story important to 
eLearning design:
P	Android: 1,254,367
P	Windows: 422,726
P	iOS/Mac OS: 397,234
P	RIM: 10,597
P	Chrome: 8,000
P	Others: 528,755
Gartner’s research director Ranjit Atwal says, “The device market continues to evolve, with 
buyers deciding which combination of devices is required to meet their wants and needs. Mobile 
phones are a must have and will continue to grow but at a slower pace, with opportunities 
moving away from the top-end premium devices to mid-end basic products. Meanwhile, users 
continue to move away from the traditional PC (notebooks and desk-based) as it becomes more 
of a shared content creation tool, while the greater flexibility of tablets, hybrids, and lighter 
notebooks address users’ increasingly different demands.”

2013, a 15 percent increase from 2012. Worldwide training spending was $130 billion. These 
large numbers are a great indicator of positive economic activity and reflect our growing

the very slow development and return on investment when 
hiring experienced professionals; they really don’t perform

adapting to the technology paves the way to lifelong distance learning, later using it for 
vocational training, continuing adult education, and, of course, college and on-the-job 
skills. Thinking about your current students as students for life will help you shape what 
and how you offer your courses and the core skills attached to them.
The results of a 12-year report gleaned from 99 studies conducted by the U.S. 
Department of Education revealed that students doing some or all of a course online 
ranked in the 59th percentile compared with the students who took the same course solely 
in traditional classrooms and ranked in the 50th percentile. Barbara Means, the study’s lead 
author, says it demonstrates how much better online learning can serve students and that 
it is better than conventional instruction. Read the full report here: www.ed.gov/rschstat/
eval/tech/evidence-based-practices/finalreport.pdf.
Thirty states now provide full online learning to all in-state resident students, with 
attendance at a 6.2 percent increase over 2013, meeting the needs of 315,000 students 
enrolling in 740,000 courses to which they otherwise may not have access (www.kpk12.
com/wp-content/uploads/EEG_KP2014-fnl-lr.pdf). States are authorizing “innovation 
zones” that give schools new advantages and the flexibility to develop, learn, and use 
online teaching methods in their curricula. Learning centers offer one-to-one teacher-
student conferencing and high tech synchronous (real time) support to students. 
Digital learning in charter schools provides custom training and support to teachers 
who otherwise lack experience, and at-home tutoring to high school students at risk of 
dropping out.
Distance Education Defined
The terms “distance education” and “distance learning” are often used liberally with varying 
definitions. The Association for Talent Development (ATD, formerly ASTD), a premiere 
network resource for training and educational development professionals, defines distance 
education as an “educational situation in which the instructor and students are separated 
by time, location, or both. Education or training courses are delivered to remote locations 
via synchronous or asynchronous means of instruction, including written correspondence, 
text, graphics, audio and video, CD-ROM, online learning, audio- and videoconferencing, 
interactive TV, and fax. Distance education does not preclude the use of the traditional 
classroom. The definition of distance education is broader and entails the definition of 
eLearning.”

Personal Enrichment
The retirement age of 65 is fading into the sunset as the new 65 becomes healthier and 
more active, as well as needing to pay bills for a longer duration. Eight out of ten baby 
boomers say they plan to work at least part time after they reach that age. They are training 
for second and third careers, enhancing their lives with personal fulfillment classes online, 
and participating in brain training challenges such as those at Lumosity (www.lumosity.
com) to keep their brains pliable and ready for action. Because seniors are often mobility 
challenged, obtaining these many knowledge gifts through face-to-face learning would 
present a challenge. Incorporating the speed of online delivery systems helps save precious 
time, boosts social skills, and offers a wide knowledge base that keeps homebound brains 
stimulated and healthier. 
The Roots of Distance Learning
The roots of education from afar can be traced back to many places, as forms of information 
were exchanged via snail mail, telephone, radio, and TV. Searching for “the history of 
distance learning” will unearth different accounts of the many steps that led to where we 
are today. Here are just a few of the contributors: 
P	 1858—The University of London was the first to offer an external study program in 
which students could and may still earn undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, 
at low cost, on completion of testing at global centers. Providing educational status 
for the income-challenged and study-by-mail for British POWS were two large con­
tributions made by University of London. Many prisoners earned degrees while in 
captivity.
P	 1891—William Rainey Harper, the first president of the University of Chicago, 
pushed the movement along by encouraging continuing education by correspon­
dence. A training program originally intended for coal miners eventually became 
the International Correspondence Schools. These distance schools multiplied rap­
idly due to aggressive selling and the appeal of receiving whole textbooks instead of 
single lessons.
P	 1920s—Education radio begins, showing how many can learn from a great distance.
P	 1940s—Television broadcasts educational information to the public. Sir Isaac 
Pitman, the inventor of shorthand, taught his students by mail. He mailed his stu­
dents assignments in the form of postcards, read and corrected their mailed assign­
ments, then sent them tutelage. 

1 / Online Learning Today    9

P	 1954 to 1970—National Educational Television (NET), owned by the Ford 
Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, provided viewers with 
five hours per day of in-depth education richly guided by historical and literary 
pillars, a stark contrast to what was being offered on all the other channels that had 
commercials and programming based purely on entertainment value. NET offered 
raw documentaries, gritty coverage of social issues such as racism and poverty, and 
gained a reputation for being a liberal “University of the Air. After controversy 
about the documentary subjects, in 1970 PBS reformed many of NET’s offerings 
and took over providing viewers educational TV. 
P	 1971—Britain offers the opportunity to anyone with access to the internet to earn a 
master’s degree through the Open University.
P	 1985—James  Milojkovic, Ph.D., and TeleLearning, Inc. create The Electronic 
University Network. “[This was] in essence the world’s first online university where 
adult students could take a core set of college-level courses and gain college credit 
[by] passing CLEP exams. This was well before the ubiquity of the internet, the 
world wide web, and high-speed broadband connections. Our students worked on 
the first personal computers such as the Apple IIe, Commodore 64, and, of course, 
the IBM PC. They accessed the network via a dial-up connection with 300-baud 
modems and were thrilled when 1200-baud modems became available! Our vision 
was 30 years ahead of its time,” says Milo (Milojkovic). See Figure 1–1 on page 10.
P	 1991 to 1994—The oldest online K–12 school in the U.S., Laurel Springs, starts in 
1991 and develops its online curriculum in 1994.
P	 1995—Two webcast developments hit the scene: Benford E. Standley produced 
one of the first audio/video webcasts in history, and Apple Computer’s Webcasting 
Group helped launch the Macintosh New York Music Festival. 
P	 1997—The term “eLearning” surfaces, possibly at a computer-based training semi­
nar, referring to distance learning, and later to 
include online, virtual, personalized, interactive 
education.
P	 2000—The Florida Virtual School offers free edu­
cation to 600,000 K–12 students.
P	 2006—Stanford University Online High School 
serves supplemental courses for gifted students 
grades 7 through 12.
P	 2011—Global Online Academy offers 53 schools 
in 24 states online courses.

P	 2013 to 2014—Online School for Girls, a consortium of 83 schools, offers 7 summer 
and 20 school-year courses.
Today, keeping on budget and transferring information quickly across the miles play a 
large role in how eLearning is used. When you call your local utility company to pay a bill 
or order service and wind up speaking with someone in another country, chances are that 
person is an outsourced employee, well trained by a distance learning program. Corporate 
outsourced services training comprises 42 percent of corporate training expenditures. 
Corporations are now more apt to reinvest in current employees who lag behind in skills, 
bringing them up to speed with online learning rather than investing in a complete fire-hire 
HR cycle.
Employees are also proactively upping their ante by requesting additional training in-
house or using tuition reimbursement programs to build their own programs from varied 
online sources. Recognizing the role online learning plays in relation to income inspires 
employees to continually evolve, and when employers see increased results or productivity 
as a result of continuing education, they too put additional value on further employee 
training. Opportunities in many industries related to enhancing employee skills are very 
lucrative.
Ask the Employer: How Much Does It Matter?
In the 2012 “Lifelong Education and Labor Market Needs” study conducted by EvoLLLution, 
employers expressed how they value ongoing education. When asked if ongoing (after hire) 
education affects compensation and salary, 87 percent responded “yes” and only 13 percent said 
“no.” Seventy-eight percent felt that ongoing education for 
employees influences their advancements and promotions 
within the company, and a resounding 96 percent agreed 
that it has a positive effect on employee job performance. 
This, compounded with the fact that 64 percent of externally 
recruited executives fail within four years of joining the 
organization, point to all thumbs up for continued training. 
With stats like these, everyone should be doing it.

Top Reasons Students Choose Online Learning
According to Franklin University, a popular online school, the top six reasons students choose 
online over traditional schooling are:
1.	 Balance. Saving time by studying when they want helps students stay active in fun 
activities, family time, and work.
2.	 Flexible, go-anywhere studying. Eating donuts on the couch in your Cookie Monster 
pajamas gets you just as ready for tests as sitting in a rigid, uncomfortable chair under 
fluorescent lights.
3.	 Accelerated courses and degree programs. Online classes like those offered at Franklin 
University often take less than 15 weeks and degree programs are usually faster, too.
4.	 Lower costs. Self-paced learning helps adult learners save on tuition.
5.	 Access to earn prestigious credentials. Ivy League schools now offer online education 
that students may not have been able to afford in the past and employers like seeing 
those names on resumes.
6.	 Self-paced learning is more effective. Reducing stress for independent learners helps 
them achieve better grades and be more productive.

The Path to Destiny
There are many professions within the eLearning 
industry. It takes a multifaceted educator to create great 
coursework, and choosing the “right” identity with which 
to enter the arena can be unclear. It’s more important that 
you take some preliminary training, then jump in and 
start learning in either an entry level or open-ended job, 
than enter the market as a perfectly defined professional. 
On-the-job learning seems to be what has best served 
the professionals interviewed for this book, providing 
foundational stepping stones to their maturation in the 
industry.
Such is the case of Julie Dirksen of Usable Learning 
(www.usablelearning.com) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
Professionals working in the training industry often see a 
way to make the jump to creating eLearning packages on 
their own. Dirksen was an English major, doing a “bit of 
training and development” for a corporation and found 
she loved designing experiences for people. She then 
went back to school to get a Master of Science degree 
in Instructional Systems Technology from Indiana 
University.
Today Dirksen is an independent consultant and 
instructional designer who creates highly interactive 
eLearning experiences for Fortune 500 companies, innovative technology startups, and 
major grant-funded research initiatives. Her focus has been on “utilizing the disciplines 
of educational psychology, neuroscience, change management, and persuasive technology 
to promote and support the improvement of peoples’ lives through sustainable long-term 
learning and behavioral change.” 
Dirksen loves learning and the research for each subject she is assigned enriches her 
own education. As an instructional design consultant you might find that, like Dirksen, 
one month might hold research for technical tutorials for fixing machines and company 
policy courses for an airline, and the next involves studying an entire organization’s 
procedures and group psychology to determine a massive restructuring plan. Do you 
love learning and research? If so, you may want to be an independent consultant and 
instructional designer.

It Takes a Village
Look at this list of professions that play a part in rolling an eLearning product out the door, 
and you’ll get an idea of some of the major skills required to make it happen:
P	 Instructional Designer (ID). This is the general contractor of the entire project. The 
ID is usually the person who has the first point of contact with the client, gathering 
the needed direction and information to then create an operational guide and style 
guide for cohesion of the project.
P	 eLearning Developer. This person makes the ID’s vision come to life with content devel­
opment, storyboarding, and assigning a structure, or body, to the technological work.
P	 Learning and Development (L&D) Specialist. This support position is the human 
learning management system (LMS) that manages the actual software LMS. With 
long-range vision, the L&D specialist organizes the overall module and supports 
and orchestrates the other contributed elements falling into place, sometimes with 
a big emphasis on technology skills.
P	 eLearning Consultant. This person is like the team coach. She helps the team best 
deliver what the client needs from the start of the creation phase to delivery and 
maintenance of the product, including choices around technology, branding, style, 
and language.
P	 Learning Strategist. Staying on top of current trends and what the competition is 
doing makes up part of this person’s contribution to the team. Taking those facts 
and affecting what the team creates in all areas of production is the other half.
P	 Chief Learning Officer. Also sometimes called a director of training, this person 
drives the direction of the whole company in the areas of scope of work decisions, 
future goals, and company structure and policies. 
You may start your company out as an expert in one of these roles but as you offer 
your training skills to different groups and projects, you’ll probably expand your role to 
encompass additional areas of knowledge essential to creating great work. As you become 
multifaceted, learning from professionals around you and rising to each new occasion, so 
do you increase your value to future opportunities. Throughout your career as a distance 
educator, it’s important to update and redefine the addition of these skills to your repertoire 
in a way the public can see. You can do this by highlighting these skills on your professional 
profiles such as LinkedIn and trade association sites, and officially adding certifications 
that validate your new learning.
Diane Elkins and Desiree Pinder met on a contract job building software for a large 
retailer when they discovered that with their combined skills they’d make a great team. 

16    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

They used the year on that contract to test the waters with one another, build more 
connections, and pay their bills while they built up their new venture, Artisan E-Learning 
(www.artisanelearning.com). Because they were building software together they had an 
extended opportunity to get to know one another and see if they worked well enough 
together to form a partnership.
Elkins says that the traits required to do well as an eLearning specialist are drive and 
an acceptance that you are going to be in job search mode 24/7 trying to round up that 
next client. “If you are a one-person shop, you have to have a lot of skills to create: course 
writing, designing video, assembling it all, and project management. That’s great if you do, 
but if you don’t you need to partner with someone.”
Identify Your Offerings 
Identifying your offerings and innate tendencies will help you hone in on which audiences 
might hold the most opportunity for you to target. After you do that, you can profile 
your audience, shape your training methods and style, and market your product in the 
appropriate venues. There are many ways to offer your talents through a curriculum and 
achieve different goals with them.
You may already understand what it is you’ll be offering to students out there in cyber 
space because you’re an active professional in the field of your subject matter, and teaching 
or talking about what you know may seem natural. Or, you might know that you like 
teaching and training but are not sure of the subject that best fits your knowledge breadth. 
Perhaps you like research and are great at assimilating large quantities of information for 
presentation. Try filling out Figure 2–1 to shine some light on the subject.
Distance learning has many portals and markets that could use your skills. Before 
outlining your offerings, first get a solid understanding of the primary markets: corporate 
training, higher education, continuing enrichment and professional education, and child 
and young adult education. Think about your personality, lifestyle, and working habits and 
ponder how you might match up with each of these areas.
Corporate Training
Do you enjoy switching your area of study every few months? The array includes training 
employees for skills in leadership, conflict resolution, corporate strategy, and critical 
thinking to name just a few. Technical, industry-specific skills training, and new hire 
orientations for large corporations are more popular needs. Corporate training requires 
critical listening and implementation skills, teamwork, and the ability to process lots of new

Are You a Natural Corporate Trainer?
Pearson Higher Education (http://home.pearsonhighered.com) uses this checklist test to help 
you understand if you and corporate training go together like peanut butter and jelly or water 
and oil:
q	 Are you able to frequently switch gears? Be prepared to review course material for 
upcoming assignments for possibly five seminars in a two-week period that are all on 
different topics. 
q	 Run training seminars. These often involve travel and long days using vibrant teaching 
techniques.
q	 Participate in the preparation of course materials. Developing new courses from scratch 
requires lots of research, focus, and testing.
q	 Set up of computer labs. Equipment must often be reconfigured in between labs. 
Although some companies employ lab aides to do lab set-ups for the instructors, not all do.
q	 Solid time management skills. You might add speaking engagements and lectures to 
your course outline, so think about what kind of traveler you are. Cab rides, flights, hotel 
stays, and getting to your destination on time and unflustered requires being organized 
and prepared for the unexpected. 
q	 Fast learner. Keeping a quick pace while absorbing new material is important. If you 
aren’t good at this, try some new study techniques, stick with very limited product 
development, or reconsider this field.
q	 Flexibility. Equipment that malfunctions, bungled travel arrangements, and people 
doing what you didn’t expect are some of the reasons you need an even temper.
q	 Mastery of skill-based teaching. Not only do you need to be able to convey new material 
easily, but you also need to be able to focus learners to a fine point on mastering specific 
skills and learning technical information fast, so they can continue working. This requires 
a focused and directive teaching style.
q	 Sense of humor. Being able to laugh makes you more approachable, diffuses awkward 
situations, and helps learners feel relaxed. 
q	 Enthusiasm. If you are passionate about what you’re doing, your enthusiasm should 
come through even when you’re tired. If you aren’t enthusiastic about your subjects, 
learners won’t be either.

the set discussion subjects off course. Do you have the affinity to use intelligent humor and 
great storytelling skills to reel attention back in? If you are easily irritated by people and 
think you can mostly stay behind the safety of your computer in your pajamas slurping 
java, reconsider. Most online corporate training does well to follow the flipped classroom 
model, incorporating a few live, face-to-face sessions for enthusiastic discussions and 
presentations. 
So, do you still think you might want to be a corporate trainer? Get ready to get 
certified. You may not need certifications to train professionals but having them increases 
your chances of getting hired and doing a better job. Check out the certifications section in 
Chapter 3 to plan your studies. 
Higher Education
Distance learning greatly challenges the definition of traditional higher education. With 
more than seven million students defaulting on their student loans, and the average rise of 
tuition at universities and colleges at a steady tick of 27 percent per year, more value-priced 
distance education is getting fair play. Statistics presented by the University of the Potomac 
compare the average cost of a higher education degree the traditional way at $85,000 to a 
$30,000 average for an equal education online. 
With the popularity of massive open online classes (MOOCs), which are often free, 
students can take classes from prestigious colleges and universities. A study by edX (www.
edX.org), an online learning resource project governed by MIT and Harvard, showed that 
in 2012 and 2013 138,000 Americans enrolled in MOOCs and topped the global charts 
with their lust for free higher learning, followed by Europe at 72,000 enrollment and India 
at 60,000. Slightly more men than women take MOOCs and usage by level of education is 
evenly spread from secondary education or below, through bachelors and post-graduate 
degrees. Websites like Open Culture list free courses from top Universities such as 
Stanford, Berkeley, Yale, Harvard, and MIT. View their list of 1,100 free courses here: www.

stay on top of which products within the markets are most sought after, and what related 
products the same market uses. The higher education crowd consumes massive amounts 
of test prep services for the GMAT (www.gmac.com/gmat.aspx), GRE (www.kaptest.com/
gre), and LSAT (www.petersons.com).

P Jiffy Lube® International, Inc. has 20,500 employees and 6,000 regular trainers spread 
throughout the U.S. They enabled employees to earn 148,000 technical skill certifications 
in 2012 and their current training hours have more than doubled since then. Employees in 
89 percent of Jiffy Lube stores are certified at an 80-percent level or above. 
P Keller Williams Realty, Inc. employs over 90,000 in the U.S. and trains its sales staff, 
with the BOLD program, to be relentless by conditioning them with mindset exercises, 
language techniques, and lead generation tactics. BOLD uses accountability teams to 
ensure participants stay on track. Last year those who graduated increased their income 
by 114 percent and closed 50 percent more transactions. 
P Capital Blue Cross employs 1,917 in the U.S. and focuses on a proven leadership attributes 
program to assess participants undergoing the training challenges. One of the training 
locations (seven sessions in a one-year span) is the dramatic Gettysburg National 
Battlefield. Positive changes as a result of the program are 100 percent increase in 
collaboration willingness, promotions to greater leadership responsibility for 75 percent 
of participants, and 80 percent of participants increased readiness to move up the ladder.
P CHG Healthcare Services employs 1,784 in the U.S. Its Lean program trains employees 
through work sessions. This training has contributed to a 20 percent revenue growth for 
CHG and in 2015 eliminated 1,626 process steps, saved 20,168 labor hours, and avoided 41 
process mistakes, totaling a $7.3 million cost savings. Employees voted their company to 
the number three position on Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list.
P Mohawk Industries, Inc. employs 19,759 U.S. workers and focuses its training on a “zero 
landfill” goal by coaching from recycling stream experts. Four of its manufacturing sites 
eliminated all waste in 2013 and saved millions of dollars in revenue, as well as prevented 
tons of waste from entering landfills.
All of these companies offer tuition reimbursement programs. Even though the impressive 
training programs they are using are somewhat industry specific, companies like these support 
new training ideas and helping employees earn additional certificates for professional growth. 
Knowing they want employees to be all they can be, what could you offer to these venues?

Students spend thousands on higher education degrees and still find the job 
market reeks of a stagnating economy. The Wall Street Journal poses the idea that if 
students took the approximately $174,000 required to obtain a Harvard M.B.A. and 
invested in themselves, via investment in their top educational priorities, à la complete 
life immersion, there would be a greater reward than the traditional road yields. It 
suggests to the student that they spend their education budget on moving to the area 
of the country where things really sizzle in their area of interest, spending quality time 
hobnobbing with key connections in their field, developing real networks with smart 
people who do what they want to do, and heeding their wisdom. Money smartly spent 
on to-the-point skills in schools that target fields with high starting salary averages will 
get students quickly earning and immersed in their occupation where they can continue 
seeking mentors. Filling in the gaps with free lectures at Open Course Ware (http://ocw.
mit.edu) or Coursera (www.coursera.org) can make a very rounded professional ready 
to take the world by storm. What kind of training might you add to this unconventional 
real-life M.B.A. concept?

Continuing Enrichment and Professional 
Training for Adults
This arena is very creative and encompasses learning 
that is as much for enjoyment as it is for occupational 
enhancement. Many colleges have an adult continuing 
or enrichment education sector that is sometimes called 
community ed. You’ve probably seen community ed 
catalogs featuring everything from photography and 
watercolor classes to training on interpersonal skills, 
relationship counseling, and even flirting. This delivery 
system is open to most any idea as long as it is fun and 
non-offensive. 
Taking some of what’s offered as in-person 
continuing education and creating a blended learning 
opportunity might be providing your community with 
new learning models. Often community centers and 
continuing ed don’t incorporate online learning with 
other subjects, instead offering online proficiency classes, 
when doing the former would accomplish two things at 
once. 
While most community ed classes are conducted 
face-to-face, there is room for creating online tools such 
as videos, quizzes, and lectures that greatly enhance the 
experience. This section of the industry may offer the 
most room for creativity because there are no standardized experiences to be measured 
against, or pre-designed certificates or degrees.
Enter-train Them
Aligning yourself with community centers and continuing education branches of colleges 
helps advertise your product and reach a large audience already interested in self-
development, entertainment, meeting new people, or just plain fun. Being an entertainer as 
well as a teacher—someone who can make sometimes shy people feel welcome—is critical 
for this area of distance learning. Because people often reach out to enrichment learning 
as a social function, they are not just looking for information; rather, they seek stimulating 
exchanges with like-minded people with whom they can possibly build a community, albeit 
a partially virtual one.
aha!
Dev Bootcamp, a 10-
week training course in 
programming, costs only 
$12,200. It takes people 
with no experience and 
teaches them how to 
code. These outcomes 
are far better than for 
students fresh out of a 
M.B.A. programs. In 2012, 
88 percent of its graduates 
got job offers at an average 
starting salary of $79,000 
(“A Smart investor Would 
Skip the M.B.A.” by Dale 
Stephens, The Wall Street 
Journal, 3/1/13). Brainstorm 
how your courseware 
ideas could help learners 
save money while getting 
condensed experiences.

You can, of course, go solo and also receive additional exposure by affiliating in 
some way with other businesses and organizations, which means you need to have good 
presentation, networking, and social skills. Giving talks to specialty clubs on your area of 
expertise is a good way to test the receptiveness of your subject matter on your would-be 
market and see if you enjoy the interaction that ensues. You can follow talks up with an 
online module focus group. 
Child and Young Adult Education
Distance learning is filling gaps all over this market, such as those to help the Common 
Core Standards Initiative (CCSI) succeed. The state-led CCSI, developed in 2009, has 
been adopted by 43 states, the District of Columbia, four territories, and the Department 
of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA). It uses consistent, real-world learning goals 
and provides a way for teachers to measure student progress throughout the school year 
to ensure they are on the pathway to success in their academic careers. This ensures all 
students, regardless of where they live, are graduating from high school prepared for college, 
career, and life. 
The standards are informed by the best state standards already in existence and 
the experience of teachers, content experts, states, and leading thinkers. Students are 
put through the latest retention methods to ensure 
the information is really sinking in and that they can 
refer back to the materials using critical thinking and 
problem-solving skills. Distance educators seeing a great 
opportunity here are using the latest retention methods 
in their designs.
Another goal of CCSI is to create a globally 
competitive U.S. workforce, which brings the opportunity 
to focus children on the subject matter of other cultures 
and languages as a must. The “2014 Curriculum of 
the Future” research report by the Center for Digital 
Education (www.thecenterdigitaled.com) reveals the 
drivers of digital education in schools. Some schools, 
such as those in the Guthrie Common School district in 
Texas, used an immersive online language program to 
fulfill state curriculum requirements without hiring more 
instructors, achieving a 96.4 pass rate and 295 percent 
increase in active learners. 
fun fact
In a recent 12-year 
study conducted by 
the Department of 
Education, students’ 
learning outcomes, (test 
results) were better with 
online learning methods 
than with face-to-face 
instruction. The report 
shows that students also 
earned higher grades 
overall than those who 
received face-to-face 
instruction.

Gamification is a trend that adults and children have made popular by favoring this 
style of teaching that takes learners through a game of fun challenges, making learning 
totally absorbing. Creating courseware that combines this style with filling a need makes it 
extra magnetic.
As new priorities change the structure of traditional education, your key to success lies 
in creating products that address several needs at once. Keep your eyes on trade journals 
and research to make sure trends don’t shift without you.
Where Do You Fit In?
You, as a future trainer, are a unique combination of experiences and the style with which 
you convey your knowledge is like a fingerprint—completely original. A large part of 
what makes distance learning successful is the trainer’s ability to address an exact need 
and convey the material in a way that matches the target audiences’ learning style and 
needs. The best way to address all of these fine points is to create an outline that acts 
as a guide, identifying the what, how, and why for your teaching plan. Taking an inner 
inventory of your talents and tendencies can help ensure you structure the right career 
for your nature. 
Multiple Markets, One Concept
You may offer your training services to a combination of these markets, such as the way 
Carl Tyson, CEO of Thinkwell (www.thinkwell.com), does. Thinkwell, an online video 
learning specialist that offers global education, has redefined what educators and students 
think of as a textbook. By studying the benefits of strong mentorship in learning and 
bridging the access gap between students and dynamic professors, Thinkwell has created 
distance learning videos that capture the kind of educational leadership that leaves lifetime 
impressions for the homeschooled and higher education crowds.
If you’ve ever had a teacher who changed your life and have stopped to wonder why he 
or she was different from the others, you have something in common with the Thinkwell 
development team. By using methods that help learners connect the dots of understanding, 
they have bragging rights to decreased failure rates, including a more than 60 percent 
increase in passing grades at the University of San Antonio’s biology course. 
Taking 16 college-level courses and replacing the usually intimidating, massive 
textbooks that accompany them with online courses make the learning feel like taking a 
relaxing walk with some very smart friends. It removes some of the stressful barriers to 
learning. Pre-algebra, calculus, biology, chemistry, and physics are just a few of the courses 

2 / Staking Your Claim    27

Thinkwell has supplied to homeschool students, gifted children, high school and college 
students, and adult enrichment learners.
Combining great professors with dynamic teaching styles and creating lessons that 
transport the outer world directly to the student is just part of why the videos are so 
engaging. Utilizing different teaching methods for a variety of learning styles has been 
another way the lessons get through to students the way no textbook can. 
Build a Unique Product
You also might want to use your skills and interest to build a foundational support product 
for the eLearning industry, like James Milojkovic, Ph.D. did. He created a two-tiered product 
that works beautifully to give new and seasoned educators everything they need to teach 
online without having to understand the technical aspects of software. First, his leadership 
development and organizational transformation consultancy KnowledgePassion, Inc. 
(www.knowledgepassion.com) coaches people like you on everything they need to know 
through video chat. Second, he “co-designed a new, state-of-the art, private membership, 
video platform called Athena (www.athena.mediacode.net) designed primarily for me to 
use with my private executive clients at KnowledgePassion and later made available for 
everyone who wished to showcase and sell their expertise online.” Basically, new trainers 
can just plug their content in and Athena does the rest.
A Realistic Week as an Online Trainer
There are many options for being an online trainer. You may be teaching a subject face-
to-face for a university or independently and adding online courses to the mix to enhance 
what you already offer. You may have an unrelated business that pays your bills and want 
Employers Investment Facts

to teach to forward your special interest or hobby, for your own growth and stimulation, in 
addition to enriching your audience’s lives. 
What about creating online training services as a way to enhance your current 
business? PhiPilates (www.phipilates.com) instructors sell webinars, online courses, 
DVDs, and live workshops to their studio clients. Fitness trainers operating a successful 
gym or personal training business sometimes generate, as an added perk for their clients, 
mobile/smartphone apps that give a five-minute workout plan, or new stretching methods. 
Offering this for free for “gold level” customers or charging a small fee are two options to 
consider. You could use this idea to attach online learning to your real-life business.
Cadence, Devices, and Audience Goals
How frequently you offer your classes, the density of the information you include, and the 
devices you choose to convey that education with will be determined by a review of your 
goals and target audience’s wants and goals. Do they wish to increase their earning power 
with advanced degrees or just look for enrichment or enjoyment? Would they like a three-
minute video to watch on their mobile device during breakfast, or are they committed to a 
few hours a week of absorbing information? 
A person’s social interests, socioeconomic status, current education level, maturity, 
drive, values, and sometimes age factor into how they will receive your product. Identifying 
the range of these factors in your target client will help keep your offerings on track. For 
example, if you are a personal trainer and want to give your clients a perk with a freebie 
video while attracting them to a series of videos for which you’d charge money, you might 
think about making a weekly, 60-second motivational tips piece that would be routed 
automatically to their phones on Monday mornings. It could have one dynamic exercise 
that could be performed in a car during rush hour, and two eating healthy on the go tips. 
By condensing the material you acknowledge the fast-pace lifestyle of your clients, respect 
their time, and don’t spin your wheels making a tool they don’t have time to use. 
Fill the Need
There are online courses being provided as solutions for things you would never even think 
of before the other person invented it—but that’s the ticket—you need to be the one to think 
of those “aha!” solutions first. Try looking at this list of business ideas for real challenges, 
then think of a few of your own. Don’t worry about whether they sound outlandish. 
Brainstorming is about pulling brilliant thoughts from your subconscious and you can’t do 
that if you’re feeling inhibited. Just let it all hang out and give it a try.

P	 First-Aid Training for Pets and Their People. People love their pets and, yes, there 
are DVDs available to rent to teach them CPR and other first aid techniques for 
their buddies, but what if you took it to a whole new level where they could earn 
certificates and become pretty advanced in their knowledge? This would not replace 
vet visits. It would enhance the relationship with the vet the same way being well 
informed before a doctor visit helps us humans.
P	 Body Simulator. There are some fun apps out there that let you see what you look 
like with different hairstyles, and even a way to dress yourself up online like a paper 
doll, but what if you wanted to see how different workouts might produce different 
effects on your physique? Do you really want huge quads? Maybe something else 
would look better. Personal trainers would be interested in this.
P	 Plastic Surgery Simulator. Doctors use these in the office but it might be something 
you could sell to a whole gamut of vanity procedure businesses, such as those who 
do chemical peels, botox injections, etc.
P	 How to Get Out of a Gang. Youth trapped in gang lifestyles just can’t seem to get 
out. The gang provides a family structure the kids crave and take care of all of 
their needs. A product that works with local law enforcement and youth groups 
to show kids steps they can take to be safe and get out would help address a huge 
problem.
P	 Ending Child Marriage Trainer. This big movement is underway as aid workers 
try to reach even the tiniest villages only accessible by foot to educate and enforce 
the eradication of girls being forced into marriage at as young as nine years old. 
Training that addresses cultural respect and providing incentives for these commu­
nities could help the movement.
P	 Help Me Write a Book. Writing the great American novel is a romantic fantasy that 
remains on a lot of bucket lists. Trouble is, most people don’t have the discipline or 
far-ranging design plans to keep it on target until it’s finished. What if you designed 
a template program that gave the writer daily assignments and plugged them into a 
book format? 
P	 Interpersonal Relationships Games Simulator. Wouldn’t it be fun to be able to say 
what you wanted to say to people without regard to what would happen? In long-
term relationships people realize the impact of their words and choose them care­
fully, not wanting to burn bridges. Is it possible for you to design a program that 
generates an online character based on all the ways a real-life partner has responded 
to events in the past and will calculate ways they will respond to events in the 
future? This could be a fun tool for choosing communication choices without fear.

It is only by really studying your market and constantly writing down your ideas in a

Top Success Factors for Successful Distance Learning
The International Council on Archives Education and Training, an organization dedicated 
to archival preservation of the world’s heritage through documents, provides a network for 
educators, trainers, and research professionals to support the exchange of information, 
preparation of training materials, and record keeping. Its top ten keys to successful distance 
education are:
  1.	 The trainer needs to be enthusiastic and committed.
  2.	 The team should include good administrative support and, depending in the type of 
materials and delivery methods used, a good design and production staff.
  3.	 The teaching materials must be properly planned so they are tested and ready in time. 
Most of the work occurs before the material reaches the students.
  4.	 There must be facilitation and encouragement of learner interaction with both trainer 
and other learners.
  5.	 The trainer needs to keep in regular contact with all the students.
  6.	 Competent use of any technology used is a prerequisite. It should be fully tested and 
explained to the students so they are familiar and comfortable with it.
  7.	 Communication and technical problems should be dealt with as they arise.
  8.	 Trainers need to use a variety of methods for interaction and feedback (e.g., one-on-
one and conference calls, snail mails, email, video and computer conferencing).
  9.	 Students could keep a diary of their views on progress and course content that they 
submit or share in some way at frequent intervals.
10.	 It is crucial to have a residential course at least once, preferably at the beginning, to 
help learners settle into the distance learning routine and to give some direction on 
study techniques.

Do You Have the Time?
A study by the Association for Talent Development using 47 respondents breaks down 
development time per finished hour of instruction into many categories. Seventy-one per­
cent of the developers surveyed used Microsoft PowerPoint and Word as their predomi­
nant software and Adobe Flash and Captivate were used by 50 percent of respondents. 
Building hours contributing to the finished hour ranged from 43 to 1,743 depending 
on a number of factors such as high interactivity with animations, lesson subject mat­
ter simulations, and instructor-led vs. text-only instruction. View the complete study 
results here: www.td.org/Publications/Newsletters/Learning-Circuits/Learning-Circuits-
Archives/2009/08/Time-to-Develop-One-Hour-of-Training.
Another useful statistic to project how much time crafting lessons will take is if 
you already have a “stand-up” or in-person training module, know that you will reduce 
converting that training into eLearning by an average of 40 to 50 percent, according to 
Karl M. Kapp, assistant director at Bloomsburg University’s Institute for Interactive 
Technologies.

Develop Your Courses
Beginning with knowing what your audience goals are creates a mission for your course 
design to follow. You can refer back to the audience goals to ensure each media tool you 
choose to convey the education helps the mission, and doesn’t create barriers. We cover 
some of what you need to know about finding out what your audience goals are in Chapter 
5, which is all about market research. Here is a guide to creating stimulating lessons for 
memory retention:
P	 In analyzing your audience, find out what they already know and set your stage for 
that. There’s no reason to teach under their level and doing so can make attention 
stray or create irritation.
P	 Make material relevant to the students by working in a context that is specific to 
their lives and goals. For example, if you are teaching teens, make sure you are up 
on the latest tech gadgets, movies, and pop-culture icons, and work those in.
P	 Use humor as an equalizer and destressor. Use it too much and you’ll detract from 
the material. Use it just enough and with great timing, and it will help learners asso­
ciate and retain key learning principles. 
P	 Stories or unusual analogies help illustrate points, engage the learner, and plant 
roots in stages (or chapters of the story) that can help memory retention. Keeping 
things fun is always a good thing. 
P	 Try to inject a human element to the most digital or virtual parts of your classes by 
using photographs, illustrations, or recorded human voices.
P	 Use multimedia sources selectively to texture your message and breathe fresh­
ness into your delivery. Some students resonate more with reading text, others 
by viewing a video, and some are most stimulated by group discussion. Use all 
of these elements appropriately and you will increase your chances of a strong 
connection.
P	 Research college texts and send away for a few that support your material, then read 
them yourself. It’s time consuming but necessary. Once Norma Schuh narrowed 
her search for textbooks that were perfect for her Confronting Mortality class, she 
requested copies for review from several publishing companies. They were happy 
to oblige after confirming that she indeed was part of the adjunct teaching faculty. 
“Personally reading the text myself, rather than reading about it, assured my satis­
faction with the content, writing style, presentation approach, visuals, teaching aids, 
etc.,” says Schuh.


P	 Use short burst of learning and give learners a chance to test their knowledge, which 
then reinforces it each time they realize they can use it in context, or answer ques­
tions correctly. This is called “chunking.”
P	 eLearning Industry’s “2015 Instructional Design Trends Compass” report stresses 
the importance of eliciting emotion. You can do this in all of the efforts listed above 
and it will help the student become attached to the material and place importance 
on succeeding.
Building Your Portfolio
Somewhere in this mix, as you either learn on the job or start from scratch building 
your own company, you’ll need to get started building a showcase of your own work: your 
portfolio. You can use work you’ve built on a team with others or create some samples with 
online tools we’ll talk about later. Think of your goal as creating a few very strong pieces 
that show the world what you can do without giving away all of your knowledge. The work 
should represent your potential and the unique ideas you bring to the table.
Building sample work in the beginning to show potential clients is a little simpler than later 
on when you’ll need a lot of technical assistance. The most potential for edupreneurs lies at the 
intersection where great ideas for courses meet the technical know-how to make it happen at 
its highest functioning level. Choosing an LMS that can keep up with the way learners want to 
learn and your continual product development is important. The best ideas in the world can 
seem invisible if their presentation isn’t understood or is shot through with glitches.
When we asked Carl Tyson about the smartest marketing move Thinkwell has ever 
made, his answer wasn’t technically marketing related. He said, “We went into the business 
believing that having the best content would win. We quickly learned that in the digital 
age ‘tools’ are massively important. The flexibility of the content and the huge amount 
What Is SCORM?
Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) was produced by a research group 
sponsored by the United States Department of Defense for its Advanced Distributed Learning 
(ADL) initiative. It is a technical standard that acts as translator-communicator of sorts and 
allows learning content and learning management systems (LMSs) that are SCORM conformant 
to communicate with each other, much in the same way that movies on DVD, no matter where 
they are from, can all be played on your DVD player.
P

of content make it critically important to provide tools 
that allow learners to manage and identify what they need 
and want. Khan Academy (www.khanacademy.org) is a 
great example. Students don’t need to know anything 
other than the type of problem they want solved. Khan 
Academy can take them to an example and work it out of 
them. Powerful. Instant answers online anytime.”
Diane Elkins says, “The issue with LMSs is not that 
they aren’t keeping up with technological advances. It is 
more that they can be cumbersome to use and companies 
often can’t get the type of information out of them that 
they want. For example, I have a client who needs to get 
question-level statistics to help with reporting for grant 
funding that they received to build the course. My course 
sends that data to the LMS, but the LMS won’t report it at 
an aggregate level. They can see how Sally or Joe answered 
each questions, but they can’t get a report that says 75 
percent of people answered B.”
Every professional we talked to agreed that making 
courseware that is 100 percent functioning for the 
student with all technical needs accounted for takes much 
more time than you think it will, and that is why people 
often form teams. Learning Solutions magazine advises, 
“Once you decide how much time you’ll need for your 
first project, triple it.” When we asked Dr. James “Milo” 
(Milojkovic) what he wishes he had known when he started he said, “It takes way longer 
than you think reasonable. It takes way more money than you think reasonable. It takes a 
team of dedicated professionals.” Granted, Milo both operates a consulting business (www.
knowledgepassion.com) and helps run Athena (www.athena.mediacode.net), but this is 
still pretty consistent with what the other professionals say, even if their businesses are on 
a different level. 
Diane Elkins talks about the tricky nature of using past work to dazzle future clients, 
“If you came from a full-time job creating training, your former employer may not let 
you share what you’ve done with anyone. Plus, you may have signed a proprietary 
content and nondisclosure agreement and that can make getting your portfolio started 
difficult.”
fun fact
What is an edupreneur? 
First defined by authors 
Dr. Don Leisey and 
Charles Lavaroni of The 
Educational Entrepreneur: 
Making a Difference as: 
“a person within the 
public schools who takes 
hands-on responsibility in 
creating and developing a 
program, product, service, 
and/or technology for the 
enhancement of learning 
consistent with the stated 
goals of and supported by 
that organization.” The 
meaning has morphed 
to encompass a greater 
umbrella of educators as 
expressed by Edtech Digest 
as “an entrepreneur in the 
education sector.”

Choosing an LMS
The LMS is a software platform that delivers, manages, and 
tracks results and generates reports for online courses and 
training programs that can be hosted in the cloud, remotely, 
or on local servers. There are many LMSs to choose from as 
online learning explodes, but here are some popular ones: 
P	 Moodle (www.moodle.com)
P	 Edmodo (www.edmodo.com)
P	 Blackboard (www.blackboard.com)
P	 SumTotal Systems (www.sumtotalsystems.com)
P	 Skillsoft (www.skillsoft.com)
P	 Cornerstone OnDemand (www.cornerstoneondemand.com)
P	 Brightspace (www.brightspace.com)
In Chapter 8 we’ll talk more about how to choose the right one for your business. 
Work with Nonprofits
Building great pieces over years only to realize they are locked for viewing can be pretty 
frustrating. There are ways around this problem. The first is to focus on work that the client 
will want to expose as much as possible. You want to be able to display snippets or short 
demos of work on your website. “We work with a lot of nonprofits and they are comfortable 
with me showing the projects I created for them because it gets the word out about their 
mission. Other clients resell the products I create for them so they want that exposure. 
Sometimes, even if the material is sensitive and you think the client would not want to let 
you display it, all you have to do is ask and they may let you if you remove their logo or 
branding from the project,” Diane Elkins says.
Several of the trainers we interviewed suggested doing projects with nonprofits to build 
your portfolio. This way your work is almost always shared and it is sometimes easier to get 
these jobs (for a lower hire rate) because nonprofit budgets aren’t usually big and after all, 
you’re new, so your rates are probably well matched.

and allow for usability with popular course management 
systems (CMS) such as Blackboard. Eliademy (www.
eliademy.com) and Course Sites by Blackboard (www.
coursesites.com) are just two of many.
Harness Your Course for Growth
Choosing one course to develop completely and sell at 
the same time could help fund parts of your business 
growth. In a recent Forbes article, instructors that were 
surveyed on Udemy (www.udemy.com), a popular 
teaching platform, made an average of $7,000 annually 
with their courses, which often only run 30 minutes. A 
recent sampling of courses showed a cost range from 
$47 to $197. Udemy also offers free courses and has a lot 
of traffic. The basic message about selling your courses 
on Academy of Mine (www.academyofmine.com), 
another LMS, is that there is little or no immediate payoff to creating an ecourse from 
scratch, however, in increments traffic and sales increase steadily. Just like with any other 
promotional campaign, these sites are controlled by the same psychology: People need 
to see something over and over for it to sink in and one day they choose it after months 
of exposure. This is, of course, only a valid statement if you choose an LMS that does 
promotion well. Watching the traffic pick-up with different eduprenuers on Academy of 
Mine went like this: “. . . the first month of traffic saw 128 visitors, the next month saw a 
jump to 552. Still, a very small amount of traffic, but it’s a 331 percent increase in traffic 
which, if you look at it that way, is a huge jump! And the next month we’re over 1,000 
visitors and shortly after that we’re just under 4,000/month,” according to Forbes.
You can sell your courses through third-party platforms, sell eLearning materials

Open Schedule Online Courses
With open schedule online courses, students are allotted the greatest amount of freedom. 
This is an asynchronous form of learning in which students are provided internet-based 
textbooks, mailing lists, email, and bulletin boards to complete their coursework. At the 
beginning of classes, students are provided a set of deadlines, but are allowed to work at 
their own pace as long as the work is turned in by the deadline. This type of learning is great 
for students who work well independently and do not procrastinate.
Hybrid Distance Learning
Hybrid courses combine synchronous and asynchronous learning to create a structure in 
which the student is required to meet at a specific time in a classroom or internet chat 
room. However, they are allowed to complete assignments on their own time and may pass 
them in through an online forum. This option is sometimes offered when a university lacks 
adequate space to accommodate all its courses.
Computer-Based Distance Learning
The main difference between computer-based learning and hybrid learning is that students 
are not allowed an open schedule. They are required to meet in a specific computer lab or 
in a classroom at a designated time each week.
Fixed-Time Online Courses
The most common type of distance learning today is fixed-time courses. As the title states, 
these courses are strictly online, but students are required to login to their online learning 
site at a specific time. Although they are completely online, the format remains synchronous 
because mandatory live chats are often required.
Promotion and Organization of Your Work
After you’ve created your first few pieces and have a solid understanding of what each person 
on an “eduteam” does, it’s time to think about putting together a course catalog. In developing 

3 / Start Your Engines    45

this you learn a lot about what your product does and does not do, and how the public should 
perceive it. Writing out a succinct summary of what your course offers includes information 
such as the benefits students will earn after taking it, what program of interest it falls into and 
how it supports that department (if you are teaching for a larger institution such as DeVry, 
Kaplan, or Walden), and degree, accreditation or certificate availability. You want to clearly 
represent the type of course it is as well, because students choose partially by the style in which 
they best learn. For example, is it a seminar with heavy interactive web modules, or is it a 
webinar series culminating with a final in-person, interactive debate?
Landing Pages
You’ll create a landing page for each affiliate or university site you are listed on. Using fitting 
keywords in your descriptions will help students find your courses. Make a list of every single 
way someone could search for your class online and use those words in your description. 
Not sure? Look up classes similar to yours and read some descriptions on Petersons.com, a 
popular host site for top schools. You can search there by degree, areas of study, tuition, and 
location. When you click on a description for the online school choices, you see with a certain 
area of study that the style of learning is somewhat defined. Whether there are online chat, 
mobile apps, online office hours, digital textbooks, and transfer credits accepted are some of 
the features covered. These are things to include in your own descriptions.
If you design your course page for display on sites of different institution, make sure 
the look and copy is consistent, allowing for relevant changes per the host or affiliate. You 
want to make it as easy as possible for people to find you.
If you have your own website, you want to also list on it the participating schools that 
also feature your work. You might create a landing page such as the type used by retailers 
on Amazon.com, showing off some of the more interesting features of your class, the same 
way that the “Look Inside” feature allows viewers to read a sample portion of books on 
Amazon.
The structure of the catalog on your website and affiliate landing pages should stay 
simple and read as comprehensive but not overwhelming. If you are offering degrees or 
certification, link those to an explanation of what is required to complete the degree, and 
what types or versions of that particular degree are available.
Your Bio Presence

or have been working as a carnival ride operator and want to teach amusement park

Professional Research
That’s on you. You are on your way to becoming an authority, someone other people turn to 
for advice on how it’s done. This means you have to love what you do and consider each day 
that you learn something new about your mission a gift. Countless researchers, librarians, 
educators, historians, writers, activists, revolutionaries, archivists, scientists, and swamis 
have dedicated their lives to discovering and preserving knowledge so that it is there for 
people like you to uncover. They do this because they understand why knowledge is power 
and how it can change lives and the world. To be fully committed to your craft is to be fully 
immersed in all of the available knowledge and research around it. So take advantage of 
white papers, studies, blogs, trade association social functions, seminars, and anything you 
can get your knowledge-hungry little hands on to be the best you can be. It’s contagious and 
will show in your product.
Setting Your Rates
You’ll need to assign a dollar value to what you do and that starts by figuring out how many 
hours it takes to make a product and what you can sell it for, or what the market will bear. 
Diane Elkins says the hourly rate range for contracting professionals who build courses is 
$25 to $125, with most people falling in the $40 to $70 range. You’ll read about how many 
hours it takes to create one hour of finished product in the study by the Chapman Alliance 
in Chapter 6, and develop your own averages after you build your first lessons. You’ll

P Students: Who are they and why do they need or want your courses?
P Marketing: It won’t sell itself, so create a well-thought-out way to tell the world.

you need to hire instructors, IT or other experts, and how much to charge for what you

factor into all of that the rate that your competition is selling work for. If you work with a 
university or other educational organization, there will be restrictions on what the course 
is sold for. You’ll either be paid a percentage of that per enrollment numbers or just a flat 
fee. But if you sell your own work, it’s easy to set prices just by comparing the most popular 
similar courses. If you are tempted to seriously undercut the competition with ridiculously 
low prices, remember that using coupons to get the ball rolling and other free promos need 
to be figured into the grand scheme of your pricing, as well as the perceived value (or lack 
thereof) of an inexpensive product. You can also make your money not from the course 
itself, but from certifying learners. Coursera (www.coursera.org) classes are often free or 
low cost, but to earn certification learners must pay $49 and up.
Look at the classes on these sites to find some like yours and compare pricing:

media-skills focused classes. $25 per month to take whatever you like. Includes

Going Public
Hosted learning management systems are widely used for education and training purposes 
and are also great for selling courses. LMSs offer multifunctional learning opportunities and 
you will be freed from managing the content manually. The LMS will do everything for you.
Sell Courses from Your Own Website
Building your own website and installing an LMS on it is another opportunity. This will 
let you keep your money, but the investment is higher than letting someone else host your 
lessons, and building a website from scratch requires some level of expertise. Content

management systems like Joomla!, WordPress, and Drupal are quite popular solutions. The 
platforms are free to install.
Barriers to entry can be low enough to just begin with creating one’s own website with 
a low-cost service and setting up the accompanying ecommerce PayPal add-ons if you are 
only using your website to create a presence and using LMSs to run your lessons.
You’ll need some basic software and only you can decide which fits your needs. 
If you are working with an organization or with a school, it will usually provide all of 
the software and systems you need, along with access to technical assistance to get you 
started. 
You can start training on your topic of expertise with no certification or accreditation, 
if you choose, but getting clients to care about your work starts with illuminating who 
you are in the most professional way, and getting certified as a trainer looks great on your 
website.

Barriers to entry can also be high in that there is a lot of competition for personal and

Get Certified 
Getting additional certifications and degrees in your field never hurts and with online 
training you could have a very attractive bio in less than a year by taking free courses and 
investing in a few certifications like those offered at the Association for Talent Development. 
Its senior manager of communications Kristen Fyfe-Mills says, 
“ATD is the professional association for those who develop talent in the 
workplace. So, to the degree that an individual pursues this work, we have abundant 
resources to help them. The common name for many in this profession is ‘trainer’ and 
many people who end up in that role get there accidentally. They may have expertise 
in a particular area and are asked to step in and teach others about what they know.
“There really isn’t a direct path to teaching online. Many companies use 
online training courses to advance [their employees’] knowledge and skills . . . and 
those who facilitate such training often translate this experience into their own 
business. Online courses are often offered as a way to efficiently deliver learning in 
the workplace. Colleges do the same thing.
“ATD offers the only certification for people in the training space. It’s called 
the Certified Professional in Learning and Performance (CPLP) credential. This 
is a professional certification—it’s not an accreditation affiliated with higher 
education entities. ATD’s education and professional development courses are not 
accredited by any organization. Some institutions of higher education recognize 
professional experience and certifications as meriting credit, but we don’t have 
any exposure to that, nor do we try to influence those decisions.
“ATD provides countless resources for people who are in the learning and 
development space. With more than 70 education offerings, blogs, books, and the 
award-winning TD magazine, we strive to provide professionals in this field with 
relevant resources that help them do their jobs better. Instructional designers, 
course writers, and programmers are all roles that exist in the eLearning field. 
We have resources for all of these roles. We also have a tool called the Career 
Navigator that allows members to craft a professional development path with our 
content-based on where they currently are in their careers and where they want to 
go. Note that Career Navigator is for members.”

Additionally, you may know your field and subject matter, but getting top-notch 
training on how to convey that is important. So many changes in the way students receive 
information are occurring as new research is done and results are seen with how students 
respond to new technologies. 
Hire Instructors
You may need to hire instructors to help create your product and provide them with the 
hardware and software they need to do their jobs. The traditional academic model uses 
instructors with Ph.D.s, but more business-oriented institutions such as the University 
of Phoenix Online tend to take real-life, on-the-job experience as a serious credential. 
Depending on your subject matter, you’ll have to decide if an academia professional or a 
business professional holds more credit.

the transition to “middlessence” and beyond, while 
celebrating this unique life juncture.
Teaching online came as a bit of an accident. “I love 
my subject matter and wanted to share my knowledge at 
the university level. I approached the same [university] 
from which I earned my masters to propose a course on 
personal mortality.”
It’s important to analyze the current class offerings 
where you will be teaching in order to define how yours 
are different or will fill a gap. At first there was some 
confusion about the need that would be filled in the curriculum by adding Schuh’s course. 
“The university already offered classes on grief and loss, which provide support and training 
for dealing with the deaths of others. However, my course is about confronting one’s own 
death and recognizing the urgency of living life intentionally and congruently in the finite 
time we each have.” Schuh says.
Ultimately, Schuh’s efforts to differentiate her unique material and learning objectives 
from existing offerings won her course a spot in the curriculum, with the caveat that it 
would be delivered online to preclude any potential duplication.
tip 
If you’re a corporate 
training expert and want 
to target your marketing 
toward larger companies 
because you think their 
training budgets are 
bigger, think again. It may 
be just as profitable to 
target smaller companies 
with less than 500 
employees. ATD’s State of 
the Industry report shows 
that smaller organizations 
spent an average of $1,888 
in training per employee 
compared to larger ones 
who only spent $838 per 
employee. The tricky part 
of the equation is that 
the larger organizations 
actually conducted more 
training hours (36) than the 
smaller organizations (27).

Group Benefits Last a Lifetime
Lining up a number of professionals you can rely on for support will help you move 
toward your goals. One of the advantages to working within an association or educational 
institution is the expertise you can draw on from being part of the group. If you’re starting 
from scratch, you can look for guidance from your trade associations, networking groups, 
and colleagues.
Purchasing a professional membership from a guild such as ATD gives you support 
and guidance from the built-in bevy of professionals around you. Both Diane Elkins and 
Julie Dirksen have remained active with their local branches of ATD and eLearning Guild, 
taking and teaching seminars, attending conferences, and keeping social alliances nurtured. 
This can connect you with everyone you need for your team. 
You can also take advantage of your association with any CMS you may use for 
technical needs. For example, if you use Joomla! (www.joomla.org) to build your website 
or use its applications, you will have access to a leadership team that can either point you 
toward what you need to know or refer you to sources for building a network of advisors.
The Department of Health and Human Services has a mentorship program expressly 
developed to retain a diverse, high-performance workforce and preserve the knowledge and 
skills of employees nearing retirement age. Read more about it here: www.mentoring.hhs.gov.
Your Mission
Your mission statement is more than a sentence or two about what you want to do. It serves 
as a framework and reminder of your specific goals to keep you on track and help you 
make decisions down the road that might seem confusing. For example, when faced with 
a potential new business opportunity that feels somewhat out of the realm of your comfort 
level, you can look at your mission statement and ask yourself if accepting the job will work 
toward the mission. If it doesn’t, you might have some soul searching to do. 
Carl Tyson’s mission for Thinkwell is “To bring the greatest teachers in the world to 
large numbers of students in higher education via the Web.” This describes his product very 
well: a video series that replaces textbooks using dynamic professors as hosts conducting 
conceptual demonstrations in a variety of locations. 
Distance trainers get involved in presenting a number of on-site training sessions 
as part of their marketing plan or curriculum. These can lead to invitations for speaking 

4 / Make It Official    55

engagements and other wonderful exposure opportunities. If Carl were to be asked to teach 
an on-site, ten-session version of one of his current courses to junior high students, he’d 
look at his mission statement and have to come up with a good reason to move outside 
it, as that project would; it is not directly geared toward the higher education crowd, or 
distance led, and it’s a long commitment that would pull him away from his mission. 
It’s not mandatory that you only provide the kind of service that supports your mission 
statement, but it’s smart to have most of what you do apply to it. If you start offering a 
mishmash of varied services, you cloud your time with tasks that don’t support your goals 
and fill your dance card with distractions that could make you miss connecting with work 
that accomplishes your mission. 
Constructing your mission should come from your heart and soul. It should reflect 
what you most want to spend your time on, because you’ll hopefully be expertly doing it for 
years. It consists of a few sentences, or a paragraph, that defines what you offer, to whom, 
and what your goal is. It should capture specifics in a short communication style and leave 
no doubt as to exactly the kind of business you are.
It should appeal to the array of customer types you intend to serve and potential 
investors in your startup or long-term funding by conveying your enthusiasm and intent. 
Here are some mission statements from eLearning educators for you to study:
P	 Palm Beach State College (www.palmbeachstate.edu). “To provide students an 
opportunity to learn in an environment which best meets their varied lifestyles, 
offering credit and noncredit courses, degrees and certifications by distance learn­
ing in order to provide opportunities for students that can’t attend traditional 
courses to complete their education remotely.”
P	 College of the Canyons (www.canyons.edu). “To develop and deliver universally 
accessible, academically sound, and technologically advanced instruction at a 
distance, while supporting student success, responding to community needs and 
promoting faculty innovation.”

Diane Elkins’ mission statement for Artisan E-Learning is, “We create custom learning

This is also a broad, somewhat open-ended mission statement, that allows for the complete 
selection of services and broad client base Artisan E-Learning appeals to. Elkins offers an all-

including self-paced, custom course development, and consulting and training services. That 
is Elkin’s “perfect solution” so clients don’t have to go elsewhere to complete the package. 
After you’ve written your mission statement, give it a probationary period. Ask clients 
if they feel it expresses what they were looking for when they found you, and what they got. 
When you’re sure it’s the right fit, you’re ready to put it on your website and promotional/

Legal Eagles
To ensure that you get off on the right foot, hire an attorney with startup expertise who can give 
you advice to grow on. You can use his or her knowledge of the pros and cons of each business 
structure to determine which one is best for your venture. You can get insight into your lease, 
buy-sell agreements, licenses, ordinances, bonding, zoning, financing, and human resource 
hurdles. An experienced business lawyer can minimize your exposure to IRS, occupational, 
employment, and safety problems. Don’t wait until the last minute to line up competent legal 
counsel you trust. You don’t want to put your fate into the hands of a total stranger.
You can reduce the amount of professional fees you have to pay by doing some 
homework—researching the answers to questions, making some decisions, and knowing 
how to do part of the paperwork yourself. There’s a growing number of books on the 
subject of forming your own business available from Nolo Press in Berkeley, California, 
and Simon & Schuster in New York City; also check out Entrepreneur Press’s Start Your 
Own Business, 6th Edition. Write or call the Small Business Development Center nearest 
you, and visit your local library or bookstore for some of the publications listed in the

For new edupreneurs, Carl Tyson stresses the importance of “recognizing that a good 
lawyer is essential for their own protection; and they need to realize that who they take 
money from as investment is more important than how much money or valuation is offered. 
It is critical that investors and business people understand the goals and rules of the road as 
they move forward to build something. Most important, I think, is that the person starting 
a business needs to have a carefully balanced relationship between their vision and reacting 
to new information. It is great to have a vision and passion but there will be curves in the 
road and new information may require flexibility. Also, it is vitally important to build a 
team of people who work together well. I have made the mistake of hanging on to a really 
talented person who did good work but could not mesh with the team. Sooner or later that 
will hurt the entire project. That said, I’d rather stick with someone too long than move too 
quickly. It’s not easy.”
Education-Specific Legal Obligations
Making your courseware equally accessible to everyone is your obligation, the same way 
a restaurant makes entrance into its establishment wheelchair accessible. Everyone must 
have the right to your services without barriers and while it is not your obligation to 
cater to every known barrier, there are some rules that are clearly important. In “Distance 
Education Report” Deborah Brown, associate vice president for legal affairs and human 
resources, and Ellen Podgor, associate dean of faculty development and distance education, 
at the Stetson University College of Law outlined several areas distance educators need 
to be mindful of:
P	 Providing a notice on your site acknowledging you are aware of your obligation to 
reasonably accommodate those with disabilities. Large font texts for the visually 
impaired or closed captioning for the hearing impaired are examples of this.
P	 Selecting in-person test sites that are accessible to those with disabilities, if in-
person testing is part of your curriculum.
P	 Making sure IT staff managing and creating your site are trained in and aware of the 
need to provide reasonable accommodations in design and usability.
P	 Understanding both the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with 
Disabilities Act to avoid having to retroactively make changes to your company 
policies, business plans, and courseware designs. Check with your state to see if you 
are obligated to fulfill additional requirements.
P	 Being aware when reviewing and deciding to enter into a technology contract. 
Choosing a long-term technology company to partner with is a choice that must

weather changes such as changing operating loca­
tions due to natural disaster or other reasons, how 
painful it will be if you have to cancel the agree­
ment, how the techs will honor your request to not 
use your logo or theirs, or vice versa on affiliate 
sites.
P	 If you are teaching for an accrediting institution, 
honoring the distance guideline standards set 
forth in your contract.
For a greater awareness of what legal distinctions 
distance educators must be aware of, read “Best Practices for 
Electronically Offered Degree and Certificate Programs” at: 
http://sacscoc.org/pdf/commadap.pdf.
Forming a Business Entity
Forming a business entity is a big step with long-term 
consequences. While it is possible to change the legal 
structure any time in your company’s life, it is time-
consuming and costly. Converting from a partnership to 
a C corporation or limited liability company will pose few 
problems, as will switching from a sole proprietorship or 
partnership to an LLC. Converting from a C corporation 
to a partnership, sole proprietorship, or LLC, however—or getting in and out of an S 
corporation—is more complicated. Think carefully before you finalize your business 
structure. To ward off impatience and other pressures, look at the three- and five-year 
projections you put in your business plan to help you stay on course. 
If you’re like most online learning specialists, you will open as a sole proprietorship or 
C corporation. There are no special steps required other than obtaining a business license. 
You may need to file a notice of a fictitious firm name and present it to your bank to open a 
business account, but there’s not a lot more required for you to start selling your products 
or services.
A partnership is formed through an oral or a written agreement, but a written 
agreement is advisable. To form a limited liability company, you need to file articles of 
organization with the state. A separate document, the operating agreement, outlines the 
rules for managing the firm. A lawyer will charge you about $1,200 to $3,000 for filling

out the paperwork. Forming a corporation usually costs 
between $500 and $2,000 upfront, according to Fred S. 
Steingold, author of Legal Guide for Starting and Running 
a Small Business (Nolo Press). There is a substantial 
amount of paperwork involved, including filing articles 
of incorporation and paying a state filing fee, which 
varies from $100 to $150. 
What’s in a Name?
Everything. Your name, like your mission statement, 
should give a quick impression of what you do. It can be 
catchy and abstract, but not so much that it sends clients 
off in another direction entirely. The sound of the word 
should sound like what your company does. If your 
branding and product are clean and simple, don’t choose 
an involved name with lots of syllables. 
Brainstorm Your Name
Get a thesaurus (or go to www.thesuarus.com), a piece of 
paper and pen and write:
1.	 Ten adjectives that describe your company
2.	 How learners might feel after working with your product
3.	 A list of words that represent the separate components that make up your product
4.	 How the world, or your students, will be changed or benefit as a result of taking 
your courses
Now open that thesaurus and make a list of synonyms for each word you’ve written 
down. Try making two columns with the words and putting combinations of two together, 
or halving two words to make one new word. The brain stimulation company called 
Lumosity uses parts of words for a specific effect. “Luminosity” means the brightest light a 
star or galaxy can give off and its root, “lumens” is a measure of the total amount of visible 
light emitted from a source. This is a perfect example of how an elegant twist on a powerful 
word can nicely represent your product. 
Below are some examples of how to combine words. Try to mix and match your list 
of synonyms this way in Figure 4–2: Business Name Worksheet on page 63. For example:
tip 
There is little paperwork 
involved in setting up a 
sole proprietorship. Get 
the necessary selling 
permits and other licenses, 
and notify the city, 
county, or state of your 
intention to do business 
under an assumed name 
(dba). You pay taxes on 
the business income as 
if it were personal salary 
and assume full liability 
for anything that goes 
wrong. You also pay self-
employment tax for Social 
Security and Medicare 
coverage.

Carl Tyson joined Thinkwell about a year after the founders, brothers, Dan and 
Chip Heath, and Amy Bryant, created it. “They tossed around a lot of ideas. The one that 
almost won was Profopolis, which means ‘a city of teachers.’ ” Not sure who came up with 
Thinkwell, but I love the name and it has served us well.” 
Protect Your Name
Corporations must register their corporate names with the secretary of state, state 
Department of Corporations, or commissioner of corporations. Each state’s laws on this are 
a little different. But in every state, you must get permission to use your trade name before 
incorporation. You have to select a permissible name, make sure it’s distinguishable from 
any corporate name already registered in the state, and then send in an application (with a 
fee) to reserve the legal right to use that name to identify your business.
Any person who uses a trade name other than his or her surname or any organization that 
goes by a name other than the last names of the owners must register the name with the state or 
county as a fictitious business name. This usually means filing a certificate with the county clerk 
stating who is doing business under that trade name. This is called a dba (doing business as).
If your state has no central fictitious name registration, you may want to check more 
than one county’s records to see if anyone else in your state is using the name you propose 
for your business. Otherwise, several businesses might use the same name in your state, and 
if you want to expand your operation, you may run into difficulties.

Your name is the cornerstone of your brand, and the identity of your company is a 
major component of your success. Because image is such 
an important part of marketing, a lot is riding on your 
name. Your signage, business cards, name tags, uniforms, 
vehicles, word-of-mouth advertising, private-label lines, 
and website will depend on the integrity of your name, so 
you’ll want to guard it carefully. 
Separate from the state law issue is the question 
of whether or not your name has any trademark value 
because it distinguishes your goods or services from those 
of other companies. If so, you can register the name for 
federal trademark protection, which entitles you to stop 
others from adopting or using it. You must complete a 
registration form from the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office in Washington, DC.
There are two very different contexts in which your 
business’s name may be used. One is the formal name of 
your business for purposes of bank accounts, creditors, 
and potential lawsuits. The second is the name you use 
to market your goods or services (trademark or service 
mark). Whether someone is using the same trade name 
as yours is of less practical importance than if they were 
using the same trademark, or using the same trade name 
as a trademark as well. If your corporate name figures 
into your future marketing plans, you must search for 
use of the name as a trademark in addition to complying 
with the corporate name registration requirements. If 
someone else is the first to use your name as a mark, it 
doesn’t make any difference whether you or they have

previously registered it as a fictitious or assumed name. They will still have the right to 
exclusive use of the name in the marketplace. Unfortunately, it’s fairly common for a small 
business to choose a name that’s similar to that of another enterprise.
There are several ways you can conduct a trademark search to avoid such problems. 
You can visit www.uspto.gov and do a search; pay a search firm; use a computer database; 
manually consult trademark registers, directories, industry journals, and other library 
resources; or use the phone or mail to consult state agencies. This can cost you from 
nothing to a few thousand dollars. Trademark searching is a competitive business, so be 
prepared to negotiate. Nolo Press has a self-help guide, Trademark: Legal Care for Your 
Business & Product Name that shows you how to protect your business and lists several 
books, software packages, and services that may help you.
Domain Name Registration
Once you have your business name, you’ll need to 
decide on a domain name. Purchasing and registering it 
can be done through your ecommerce provider or you 
can handle it yourself through Register.com, Domain.
com, DomainNames.com, Networksolutions.com, or 
GoDaddy.com. You can try out versions of the name you’d 
like on these sites and they will tell you if it’s available or 
offer other solutions for you. For example, you may not be 
able to buy www.EvolveNow.com, but www.EvolveNow.
biz or www.EvolveZone.com may be available. Owning 
the domain can cost as little as $9.99 per year. Read about 
incorporating your domain with a well-built website in 
Chapter 8. 
Insurance Is Peace of Mind
Lawsuits are in the news every day for both serious and silly offenses, which often are a result 
of simple mistakes and lack of education. If you deal with the public, you need insurance 
no matter how careful and thorough you are. Insureon’s latest big data figures show most 
small businesses pay an average of $576 per year for either of the two most popular general 
liability policies:
P	 $2 million aggregate. During the lifetime of a policy, usually one year, the insurer

During your research ask potential providers for 
cluster quotes on the other policies you may need, such 
as fire insurance for your office, or other natural disasters 
related to your geography, and health or group health for 
employees. 
Accreditation
If offering learners academic credit or certifications is on 
your menu, you must be accredited in a legitimate way by 
a formal accreditation body. This can take several years 
to obtain but provides you with a necessary degree of 
legitimacy. 
For education in an area outside of academia or 
a niche subject matter, each of these areas has its own 
governing body from which you must decide to choose 
accreditation. For example, if you teach food safety 
classes you want to get accreditation from the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) Conference for 
Food Protection (CFP). Law schools are accredited by the American Bar Association, 
medical schools by the American Medical Association or Association of Medical Colleges, 
and so on.
Anyone can open a business and call themselves an online university by getting a 
fictitious business statement and setting up a website with some course offerings, and many 
colleges operate for years before achieving accreditation, but students today know that a 
degree from an unaccredited institution is not the best value for their money since it as not 
as valued in the job market. To some, it has a fraudulent stigma.
These websites make it easy to earn a degree in a limited amount of time or a degree 
based on “life experiences.”
It’s important to start the process of getting accredited as soon as possible from the 
Council on Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) or the U.S. Department of Education.

In the meantime, offer classes that clearly display fulfillment of the requirements set forth 
by those governing bodies.
Different forms of higher education can require different forms of accreditation and 
are governed by the laws of your district. Google “your state” + education commission, or 
higher education. 
At the highest level, six regional associations handle college accreditation, which are 
listed on the CHEA website here: http://chea.org/Directories/regional.asp.
Beware of the Bogus Diploma Syndrome
Don’t fall into any of these categories! Bogus diploma or degree mills date back to the late 1800s 
and still exist, selling invalidated education that doesn’t hold water for students struggling to 
get jobs. Ten signs of a degree mill, put out by Get Educated (www.geteducated.com) are: 
  1.	 Your chosen university is not accredited.
  2.	 Your chosen university is accredited . . . but NOT by an agency recognized by the Council 
on Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA, at www.chea.org) or the U.S. Department of 
Education (instead, by a bogus accrediting agency). 
  3.	 Admission criteria consist entirely of possession of a valid Visa or MasterCard. 
  4.	 You are offered a college degree based on a “review” of your work experience and faxed 
resume. 
  5.	 You are promised a diploma—an instant degree—within 30 days of application, 
regardless of your status upon entry.
  6.	 You are promised a degree in exchange for a lump sum—typically $399 to $2,000 for an 
undergraduate degree and up to $3,000 for a graduate degree.
  7.	 Your prospective university has multiple complaints on file.
  8.	 Your online “admission counselor” assures you that international online universities 
can’t be accredited in the United States by CHEA-recognized agencies. 
  9.	 The school’s website either lists no faculty or lists faculty who have attended schools 
accredited by bogus agencies. 
10.	 The university offers online degrees almost exclusively to U.S. citizens but is 
conveniently located in a foreign country, quite often a tiny nation that lacks any 
system of academic accreditation.

and refine the role you’ll play in the industry. This should 
have left you with a clear understanding of what your 
eLearning identity might be. This will help you seek out 
the stats you need to fortify and direct your plan. Using the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov) might, for example,

reveal how many adults in your geographic area graduated from college, how many are in 
a related field specific to your training topics, and how many workers there are in related 
corporations that may appreciate your training.
Research Today, Act Tomorrow
Collecting stats and facts on your audience is a long-range strategy to make today’s patterns 
work for you tomorrow. Keeping track of industry news can help you anticipate how to 
refine your products and where to sell them—some industry tipping facts can dramatically 
take your business on entirely new adventures, depending on how you decide to use the 
information. Consider a well-thought-out market research plan an essential part of your 
agenda and allow daily attention to it. 
Facts change rapidly in distance learning, and tracking which areas grow fastest and 
which tools and methods are trending over the course of years can help you calculate your 
best long-term direction. Elearning Industry’s “2014 and 2015 Top Statistics and Facts” reports 
that 77 percent of U.S. companies offer online corporate training to improve the professional 
development of their employees, and for good reason. Productivity boosts up to 50 percent and 
a $30 profit return on every one dollar spent on the training keep the trend growing. 
If you offer college courses, knowing that 46 percent of those students take at least 
one of their courses online, and by 2019 about half of all college classes are predicted to be 
eLearning based, can determine what you offer. According to Pew Research Center, 2015 is 
the year the millennials (born in the early 80s to early 2000s and also known as Generation 
Y) will surpass the baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) and the Gen X (born 
early ’60s to late ’70s) will be next in line to dominate the population, surpassing boomers 
in 2028. Coupled with tracking what distance learning these groups consume each year 
should be a supporting piece to your overall market research plan.
Other factors such as the voluntary adoption of the Common Core State Standards 
Initiative encourage K–12 students to prove they understand what they’ve learned by 
referring back to study materials using critical thinking, analytical, and problem-solving 
skills. As more states agree to measure progress by these standards, some distance educators 
are capitalizing on it by using the latest retention methods in their designs. How will you 
harness industry numbers to be the wind in your sails?

industry each year, if their salaries rise or fall, how many dollars are being spent on the 
type of education you offer in your state, and if there seems to be expendable income for 
enrichment in the area where you live. Educational blogs, research firms, chat rooms, and

Each year, plan a five-day hiatus that combines research, a therapeutic setting, and just you, 
ready to focus. If you think you can’t afford to get away, think again. Dedicating a few days to 
uninterrupted research can bring tremendous direction and relief to your growth plan. Here’s 
how to construct your five-day plan of attack:
P Choose a location that is beautiful and relaxing where there is a stimulating industry 
seminar or training event you can attend for the first one or two days to spark your 
imagination. Getting inspired before your big research endeavor will help you key into 
things you might not otherwise notice. See a list of events in the Appendix for ideas.
P Before your trip, create an outline that contains areas of importance to get the latest 
stats on. These can be related to areas of struggle in your business, new things you’d like 
to try, the most outrageous one-hit-wonders and overnight successes in your field, what 
your competitors are doing, and kicky new tools, software, and methods trainers are 
using. Certainly include updated stats for your demographic such as what their income 
is, where they are, how old they are, and what their priorities are.
P Reserve an inexpensive hotel with wifi in a picturesque setting close to your event, 
and plan to stay in your pajamas with good coffee and breakfast long into the morning 
researching the outline you’ve created ahead of time.
P Reward yourself once a day for all of your hard work with a totally indulgent break such 
as seeing a movie and going out to dinner, a hike at a state park, getting a massage or 
new hairstyle, or sitting on the beach with delicious take-out.
P Last, and most important, on your last day create an action plan that takes into account all 
of the results of your research. Organize action steps into daily, weekly, and monthly tasks.

comments about the aforementioned studies. This could be an article written by a trend 
watcher who conglomerates current findings from several sources to draw a conclusion, 
which is helpful if the writer is an industry expert and uses respected sources of primary 
research.
Be a Trend Watcher
One of the most important things to keep an eye on is the current trends. For example, 
we know that the gamification of lessons is very popular right now. Knowing that could 
shape the way you give information to your students—both in marketing and product 
development—and give you an edge. We also know that the seamless interchange of group 
information is being used a lot. Communities can now learn from one another with ease 
and collaborate on projects with sharing platforms such as Google Docs, Dropbox, and 
other cloud storage services. Being able to have many talents at a geographic distance 
from one another contributing to a single project can make a more complete product. Co-
browsing and live chat software like Channel Me (www.channel.me) allows for face-to-
face video meetings and the ability to look at and change the same document at the same 
time across the miles is invaluable. SearchTeam (www.searchteam.com) allows multiple 
users to search together and build a project, such as a family reunion, or hunt down 
valuable medical information for a loved one together. Mind42 (www.mind42.com) lets 
multiple users create mind maps, which are visual tracks of how a brainstorming session 
flows and creates new ideas. Tools like these contribute to great teamwork, and were 
developed by savvy trend watchers who recognized the rising popularity of collaborative 
work and user-generated content.

just help you find them so you can send advertising their way, it helps you make a better 
product for them. For example, if you’ve created an app that helps new mothers make 
homemade, organic baby food in 10 minutes or less, you know that these new moms are 
pressed for time. Taking a deeper look at the situation by sending out a survey or holding 
a focus group might reveal these moms also are concerned about the higher costs of 
organic produce. So, why not add a tool to your product that searches the best deals and 
specials on organic produce by zip code? You might also realize after probing further that 
new moms want to understand the nutritional makeup of each food they make, so adding 
a nutritional tool would be smart, too. Do you see? In the beginning you were just going 
to offer a how-to recipe series, and now you’ve created a tool for almost everything they 
could want in one spot.
Target Market Analysis
Your marketing and business plans will be helped by good market research and show 
potential investors that you know what you’re talking about and who needs what you’ve 
got. There are many ways to go about market research. You can spend millions of dollars 
targeting a general audience with consumer focus group surveys, or you can create 
specialized surveys for a select group of people that represents your larger audience. 
Holding an event at which guests experience your product and are encouraged to give 
feedback is another way to do it. Repeating this presentation style market research over and 
over to varying groups is a good way to defray your labor costs and get the most for your 
money since you will be using the same presentation over and over. Offering an incentive 
such as a choice of select, free service coupons for guests who fill out a more detailed panel 
of information yields even more information because the free service they choose gives you 
topics for a longer conversation.
Whichever way you choose to glean valuable information from your potential client 
base you must create an imagined and then verified profile of who they are. Use the 
worksheet in Figure 5–1 on page 74 to consider your target market. After you read each 
question use the blanks to fill in your own ideas about your customers.
Targeting an Organization or University
If you’re thinking about teaching through an organization or university, it’s important 
to target your research toward that organization as well as at the class participant. The 
informational interview is a valuable tool in assessing whether your course offerings match

up to what a corporation or university needs. Remember that the professionals running the 
organization also need training to update their skill sets or certifications and that training is 
not just for their employees or students. Remembering this can help you take advantage of 
a built-in second audience when developing your products.
“Although teaching online was not initially my intention, I now feel fortunate to 
be part of the current flipped classroom movement designed to enhance learning by 
supplementing traditional teaching with online instruction. At first I was concerned 
about not having face-to-face time with my students. I contemplated ways to add real 
time sessions via Skype, for example, but in researching asynchronous strategies with the 
university’s instructor development faculty, I was reminded that a flexible schedule is key 
to the majority of students who take online classes and synchronous instruction is often 
critical to their participation and success,” Schuh says.
Focus on Focus Groups
To develop the most complete product possible that will be needed and wanted, ask several 
institutions pertinent to your subject matter for an informational interview that will include 
a sampling of administrators and students, and both employees and upper management. 
Tell them you’d like an hour of their time and will cater the event with pizza (or whatever) 
during a lunch hour so the boss won’t be worried about labor costs being wasted. Ask 
questions like these once you get your audience:
P	 Is training needed at this organization?
P	 What kind of training would help in the areas of: communication skills, emotional 
intelligence, technical, self-enrichment, job specific, human resources, student ori­
enteering, life skills, etc.?
P	 What does the organization see as its current biggest struggles?
P	 What do the employees or students see as the biggest hurdles?
P	 What type of delivery would work best for training sessions? 
P	 How long and frequent would sessions be to accommodate current schedules?
P	 What technology, tools, and materials will participants need to take the training, 
and are they available?
The answers to these questions presented to several groups should shed some light on 
your development and marketing efforts. Even if your product idea is great and you’ve got 
your mind made up, getting information on logistics and needs can help you make it better.
If your product development is already underway, supporting your focus group or 
event with a sample is a good idea.

Know Your Competition
If you’ve decided you’re going to offer an online service, including a series of online videos 
that trains women how to dress for success with under $500 per year (write down that 
business idea!), then who, you may wonder, is your competition? You have to identify 
your competition not just to know who is offering a similar service or product, but also 
to harness what they have done to your advantage. In the case of the Women’s Dress for 
Success service, since it is a unique idea, there may not be an exact competitor match, but 
there may be a business that captures that part of that market’s dollars. In this kind of a 
situation, ask yourself what your exact market spends their money on and investigate which 
businesses are doing well in your area. If your town has several thriving fashion resale 
businesses, an array of funky vintage clothing shops with quickly rotating merchandise, 
and large companies that employ women, you may be in the right place at the right time. 
A quick search for “virtual dresser you can try on outfits online under $500 year” revealed 
a starting point for this exercise: Fits.me (http://fits.me)—a virtual fitting room solution.
Think about how your service might help these women who want to look unique in 
eclectic, but professional attire for a fraction of typical high fashion costs. It’s important to 
market your service to people with some money to spend on learning how to save money, 
which may seem counterintuitive. This idea should help direct what you offer; if you were 
thinking of showcasing rock bottom deals on fashion and how to wear it, think again. You 
need to appeal to those with money to spend so you should research how much money 
is spent on clothing per year by your demographic and then undercut it, but not to the 
bottom of the barrel or you’ll lose your perceived value. 
Competitor Analysis
This is the place in your market research where you scrutinize what your closest competitors 
are doing. Some of the questions you answer will help you figure out what you should be 
doing to do it better than they do, or differently to gain a unique edge. Use Figure 5–2: 
Competitor Analysis Worksheet on page 77 to build a profile of your competitors and put 
together a game plan to trump them.
The Economist 2014 report, “The Digital Degree” suggests the competitor that 
universities must study is MOOCs. Universities have to find ways to compete with 
MOOCs’ low startup costs and gargantuan accessibility and reach or they will sink. 
Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen considers MOOCs “a potent 
‘disruptive technology’ that will kill off many inefficient universities” and predicts 
financial ruin for more than half of them within 15 years. This is what not adapting at 
the rate of your competition can do.

Where Is Your Audience?
The Association for Talent Development (ATD) “2014 
State of the Industry” report says learning departments 
are responsible for providing content across a wide 
variety of topics and needs. About a third of their 
content is focused on managerial and supervisory skills, 
mandatory and compliance training, and profession- or 
industry-specific training. The remaining two-thirds 
cover topics such as processes and procedures, customer 
service, sales training, and executive development.
Every organization has unique needs and challenges 
that the learning function will need to address. How it 
does so and what it offers affects how it aligns with the 
benchmarking statistics presented. Just as organization 
size and industry influence the direct learning 
expenditure per employee, the types of training offered 
and methods of delivering training also have an impact.
Thirty-four percent of all corporate training dollars 
spent in 2013 falls into the top three content areas of 
mandatory and compliance training, managerial and 
supervisory training, and profession- or industry-
specific training. The bottom three content categories 
were executive development, interpersonal skills, and 
basic skills, amounting to 19 percent of training dollars,

Your Competitive Edge
Successful businesses have a history of being able to offer customers something either unique 
or that speaks to a need competitors were unable to meet. Incredible ideas don’t just come 
from the epiphany tree or exceptionally gifted people, and usually hugely popular trends 
or unique businesses don’t have a magical genius at the helm. They come into existence 
because of a series of evolutionary events. A person who is watching, calculating, recording, 
and analyzing needs, trends, and appetites positions themselves perfectly to strike when the 
time is right and is justified in doing so with all of that research.
Often an entrepreneur will have tried several other ideas or have been involved in 
other businesses that were conceptual stepping stones leading to the final great idea, that 
is, the idea no one was currently doing where a need may have not even been realized yet.

Five eLearning Business Concepts Someone Should Start!
You can rethink, piggyback, and expand on existing ideas to create new ones based on need. 
Here are five great concepts to get you started. 
1.	 Training to accompany do-it-yourself cabin, modular, or tiny house kits. Customers order 
the homes, pull out the instructions, and then the phone calls start to the supplier. Make a 
brief training course that would highlight the top most common mistakes and challenges 
customers come across when assembling the kit. 
2.	 Taking food production workers up to the next level. Often dishwashers wind up being 
chefs by paying their dues over a course of years, learning little by little, on the job. 
What if you offered restaurateurs training that would teach chefs new techniques with 
current food trends, teach dishwashers how to be waiters or chefs, and teach hosts how 
to manage the floor? 
3.	 Food production waste and profit reduction training is always a problem in food 
manufacturing and restaurants. Employers often don’t have the eyes and ears to 
monitor and correct all of the bad habits and mistakes that contribute to massive profit 
loss. Offering smart operational procedure training would seem worth the investment. 
Connecting to produce suppliers, food safety trainers, and operations managers may 
yield exposure to possible clients.
4.	 “Your First Year” relationship, partnership, or marriage training complete with the 
misunderstandings, conflict sources, and communication challenges most couples have 
and how to resolve them. The series could include funny and entertaining interviews 
with couples married over 50 years. Pairing up marketing with marriage service providers 
such as churches, Las Vegas quick wedding chapels, gown shops, specialty bakeries, and 
relationship therapists would be smart.
5.	 “Reinvent Yourself at Midlife” training to help those looking toward a second life take 
an inventory of the road not taken—and take it. Deep soul searching for meaningful 
work, activity, and world contribution plans, refreshed fashion advice, revamping one’s 
physique, and recreating a circle of friends could be topics. Market to assisted living and 
memory care centers.

That combination was quite a vantage point to study the industry from. “Then I started 
thinking about how the web was going to be a problem for print books. I noticed the 
web offered amazing potential for both effectively transferring knowledge efficiently and 
reaching a large audience. I thought online learning would revolutionize methodology. I 
was correct but of course the revolution turned into an evolution. However, I still believe 
digital learning offers a powerful solution to teachers, authors, learners, and businesses. 
Random access to highly searchable information is the first real advancement in how 
information is presented since consecutive pagination,” Tyson says.
Don’t Ignore Your Research
Experts agree that research is useless unless you act on it. Draw conclusions from the facts 
you collect. Create action statements that show answers to problems or voids you discover 
and you’ll find your research takes on a new shape.

Dream

ness. Some entrepreneurs secure funding, some use 
savings, and some create products and sell them, 
using the profits for growth instead of borrowing. You can 
harness your profits to build your business, which has its ben­
efits. If there’s a greater feeling than doing something yourself, 
without help, it’s the feeling of not owing a dime to anyone.

Growth is great, but the negative aspect of growing 
as fast as your profits is that it puts a double stressor on 
your plans. You’ll always be aware of the fact that the 
project you’re trying to focus on today is controlling 
what you’ll be able to fund doing tomorrow. The sanest 
plan, according to most of the educators in this book, is 
to save money or create a product that generates a steady, 
if not large, stream of money while you slowly grow your 
business. Growing your business at the rate your existing 
product produces profit gives you a chance to calculate 
your moves while gaining a deep understanding of the 
industry. 
Even if you don’t plan on seeking a startup loan or funding from an investor, getting 
ready for the process will provide several benefits to your endeavors. You’ll probably need 
to establish lines of credit with suppliers and later on you might want to expand your 
business, turn it into a franchise, or even sell quickly to raise funds for a new idea. At any 
rate, getting your credit in order and creating a savings plan will help future investors 
believe in you and lend security and credibility to your business.
How Much Will It Cost?
In your first two years you’ll invest in things built to last, such as product development, 
software, landing talent, creating company structure, obtaining offices, equipment, and 
all things around marketing and branding, such as website development. That means in 
your first year or two costs will usually be much greater than the following years because 
once those things have been purchased, many of them don’t require as much money to 
maintain. Consider your first two years as investments in the future. Around year two all 
of the work you’ve spent growing your brand, landing the right customers, and showing off 
your products should start to help your first year expenses seem a little less intimidating as 
you see more and more clients purchase your coursework.
There is no set formula for determining your eLearning startup costs, but answering 
these questions can help you crunch the numbers required to determine your budget, 
starting figures, and maintenance costs. 
P	 Who will you hire to build your website and create your branding? How much will 
that cost and how long will it take? Get estimates from contractors and look up 
salaries that represent the scope of this project.

P	 How long will it take you to build the first few products that will attract a client base? 
Remember that your ability to generate money is only as strong as your product is 
good. Don’t cut corners. 
P	 How long will it take you to build the accompanying pieces to your product, ensuring 
they are technically complete and can be used in full? Estimate your hours, weeks, or 
months.
P	 What kind of software and equipment do you need to build those pieces? Cost it out.
P	 Will you contract your team or hire them? If they are contractors, get rate estimates 
for the breadth of your complete project. 
Your technical staff, IT contractors, or IT web 
solutions, such as your chosen CMS, comprise an ongoing 
investment to ensure your hard work is delivered to the 
client. Create a separate estimate for the maintenance 
programs required to deliver seamlessly. You might not 
know now what it will take to make that happen, but you 
can look at products with similar technical needs and ask 
those companies how IT services the product and where 
it comes from.
P	 How many team members will you hire in your 
first two years and what will their adjusted 
growth salaries be? Research and record aver­
age salaries for each job role in your geographic 
area.
P	 What kind of salary will you pay yourself? 
P	 What are the day-to-day expenses of running an 
office?
P	 How much money will your team spend on travel 
and presentation expenses as you try to sell your 
product?
Education manager Howard B. Schechter estimates 
typical startup costs for a Fortune 1000 company to 
be in the $100,000 to $200,000 range and $30,000 to 
$50,000 for a small business or divisional learning 
initiative, which typically already has customer relations 
management (CRM) software needs accounted for.
tip 
What’s the difference 
between a course (or 
content) management 
system (CMS) and a 
learning management 
system (LMS)? An LMS is 
more of a training control 
system and is a platform 
or host for all kinds of 
eLearning courses, and 
provides tracking identity 
and completion and 
scoring data. It allows 
administrators to create 
reports, assignments, 
and reminders on the 
spot. A CMS is a content 
management application 
and includes editing, 
adding and viewing 
options such as security, 
and controls on master 
files and managing 
versions of shared 
documents.

Estimating how much it will take to build your first year out involves knowing how 
long it will take to build your product, and you might not have any idea at this point. In 
Chapter 3 we talked about how many hours it takes a team to create one hour of learning. 
The Chapman Alliance estimated an average 43 production hours are behind every hour of 
finished, complete learning for the student. Using that kind of formula is a good place to start. 
After you build some of your first sample lessons you’ll understand more specifically 
how many team members it will take to create a finished product. Maybe you make it all 
yourself, but most eLearning products at least require continuing technical help so the 
product is delivered smoothly. 
Carl Tyson says, “There are numerous theories about how to come up with startup 
costs and what sort of money you need to raise. A lot depends on the source and cost of 
funding. If you can afford to build out your infrastructure and get a beta product going 
without outside funding—or with funding from friendly sources—you can enhance the 
valuation you get from investors. Of course, not everyone can do that. You need to estimate 
what the costs will be in the first six months to get going: tech, software, people, contractors, 
etc. Then add some percent to be safe.

There is a critical balance between wanting to raise money to be secure—having some 
money in the bank to meet payroll—and raising as little money as possible early on because 
the valuation will be low to start. You want to sell as little of your idea as possible at low 
valuations.”
Regardless of outside cash you may be able to raise, the SBA coaches new businesses to 
have one dollar in cash or business assets for every three dollars of sought loans.
If you only have $5,000 in cash, you should be looking for a business whose total 
startup cost is in the $15,000 to $50,000 range. The low end of that spectrum caters to those 
with little or no experience and the high end to an experienced business owner who can 
show banks a track record of repayment ability from documented cash flow management. 
So what will it take to get you in business? Set up a budget and list your operating 
expenses for the first three months—the time it will take to create and advertise your 
product, and hire help. Go down the worksheet and itemize everything you will need 
to “open your doors” and acquire that first customer. There are so many variables that 
you might want to talk with retailers in your market as well as a knowledgeable SCORE 
counselor (www.score.org) whose background is in distance education. The tips you gather 
can guide you in seeing if you have enough cash on hand to do the deal, or what you’ll need 
to get from advances on your credit cards, loans, and vendor assistance. Talk over your 
projections with your accountant. 
Shine Up Your Credit
An absolute must is establishing two different credit profiles: personal and business. Lending 
institutions consider both of those credit scores when deciding if you’re a reasonable risk, 
so if you have poor personal credit, establishing good business credit can help your average. 
This can give you time to work on your personal credit as well. The first thing to focus on 
in this multistep process is getting out of debt, if you have it. 
Consumer expert Clark Howard (www.clarkhoward.com) gives these seven simple 
power steps to get out of debt fast:
1.	 Stop borrowing money and fantasizing for a lifestyle beyond your means. If you 
don’t have money for something, don’t even entertain the idea of buying it.
2.	 Make sure that the next time you have an emergency you’ve got a $1,000 emergency 
fund set aside for just that, rather than using a credit card to deal with the unex­
pected mess. That will only rack up extra expenses.
3.	 Stick to a realistic budget that you create by looking at what you actually spend 
money on.

90    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

4.	 Bring some extra cash into your life by, well, work­
ing a little more. Either pick up a second job or 
take on more freelance projects. If you’re paid by 
the hour at your current job, ask for more hours. 
Clark delivered pizzas for 18 months to support 
his and his wife’s debt-free goal.
5.	 Look at your budget and try to reduce certain 
spending areas, perhaps substituting something 
else that’s free. For example, if you love mov­
ies and spend a ton of money on renting them, 
check out free DVDs galore at the library 
instead! You can usually keep old releases for a 
whole week and check out seven to ten at a time. 
You might have to cut your dining expenses 
down and make a fun food theme night at home 
instead.
6.	 List your debts from smallest to largest and pay 
them off that way. It will give you confidence and 
inspiration to cross them off the list. Another 
method that can save more money in the long run 
is to list your debts by interest rate, paying off the highest ones first. This is called 
laddering.
7.	 Any excess cash that winds up in your life, such as a car sale or tax refund, should 
go to paying the debts to increase the speed of them melting away.
For more education on living a quality life to its fullest, pick up a copy of both of Clark’s 
books. Clark Howard’s Living Large for the Long Haul, which showcases 50 Americans 
living below their means and saving lots of money, and Clark Howard’s Living Large in 
Lean Times: 250+ Ways to Buy Smarter, Spend Smarter, and Save Money.
If you have poor personal credit and can’t wait for the time it takes to establish good 
credit, you might be able to secure a business loan with the equity in your home, but think 
seriously before doing this because the profit in your first two years of business can be very 
hard to predict.
Pay off your credit card balances and bills on time. Open a business credit card or 
two and use them for small things, often, and then pay the bill every month on the same 
day. Marco Carbajo, writer for the Small Business Administration, suggests being wary 
of credit before you try to get it. Just because it is offered, doesn’t mean you can afford

fire. He’s so excited about it

it. Credit companies don’t know what your expenses 
are, and they don’t concern themselves with your ability 
to pay back funds. That’s up to you. Carbajo advises 
to consider these three points before filling out credit 
applications:
1.	 Ask yourself how you intend to use the credit you 
receive. Will it be a day-to-day credit card used for 
odds and ends or a special reserve card for major 
expenditures? For daily use and a good habit of 
paying it off every month, look for a card with a 
low interest rate and a sizable credit limit. If you’ll 
take a while paying for high-ticket items, then the 
low interest rate is very important. In both situa­
tions, look for a card with no annual fee and a long 
grace period.
2.	 Read the fine print. Don’t get hooked by a low 
annual percentage rate (APR) only to find out after the introductory period 
expires you’re paying a lot more than you bargained for—cancelling your card can 
lead to negativity on your credit report so make sure you know what you’re getting 
into.
3.	 Pay ahead of the due date, and pay the entire balance monthly. Managing your busi­
ness credit creates a positive credit history, so sign up for alerts on your credit report 
to ensure you see what others see, and only charge what you know you will be able 
to pay for without incurring debt.
Your Business Plan
Writing your business plan is something you’ll want to do early in the game if you plan to 
seek funding. It shows investors the facts about your business and that you’re serious and have 
a plan. You want to illustrate to potential investors how your business will offer a relevant, 
unique solution that speaks to market trends. Showing how the product generates profits by 
offering an affordable solution that cannot easily be copied is key. The way that new growth 
is expected to play out is something you should include, too. Here’s a guide to structure your 
writing:
P	 Introduction about how your qualifications lead to running the business. Include 
past successes.

P	 Detail how much money the company will make accounting for up and down

P	 Summarize the most important points of everything you have just written to a suc­
cinct list and place it at the top of your business plan. Investors will quickly glance 
at this to decide if they want to read further.
Tap Your Network
Networking is something that will help with all aspects of your business, especially funding, 
which rolls into blogging and marketing. Julie Dirksen never had to seek funding. She says 
she had grown a pretty substantial network when she started her business because she knew 
she wanted to write a book, so she leveraged the marketing with press around that book, 
Design for How People Learn, published by New Riders. When she quit her full-time job, 
she used her network to find consulting work. After admiring Dirksen’s two-year old blog, 
the acquisitions editor at New Riders contacted her about writing a book. “She championed 
for me in the process,” says Dirksen. 
Carl Tyson attributes his networking base and stirring up new work to his years in the 
publishing industry, but says Thinkwell did seek two sources of funding in the beginning, 
“When I joined Thinkwell, the founders had raised a small amount from an angel investor 
and built the first two products, so we were then able to go to raise money from venture 
capital firms. That was possible in the late 1990s . . . today it is harder to find. Institutional 
investors will not invest today in a complete concept without products and some proof of 
customer/user acceptance. That is, few folks are willing today to invest in an idea. They 
want proof of concept. In the old parlance of venture capital, they want to make sure the 
dogs will eat the dog food.”

Types of Funding
Look at the types of funding that you can combine to meet startup, expansion, and growth 
as you mature.
Personal Assets
This is a good idea if you have pure savings to use without leveraging something important, 
like your home, which is risky. Taking out credit card loans is also a bad idea because you 
don’t know what kind of unforeseen circumstances will occur. But investors want to know 
that you are putting some solid resources on the line before they do the same, so leveraging 
profits from a steady producer such as getting paid for producing a few courses over time is 
a nice way to stockpile a budget reserve for your day-to-day business expenditures.
Loans
You need good credit and usually some saved money to get lending institutions to take a 
chance on you. You need to convince a lender that you have solid projections skills, are 
a business genius, and that your idea is accounted for in all areas of your well-written 
business plan. The Small Business Administration is a good source of information for 
business loans.
Friends and Family
Of course they want to see you succeed and to help you, but think twice about borrowing 
from them. It can damage relationships. But it can also work. Our advice is to go through 
a formal process, drafting up paperwork with the terms of the loan, and a schedule to pay 
back with interest, just the same way you would do with a bank. And never, ever miss a 
payment. Your family and friends may not be able to help you but they can help pitch your 
idea to people who might love the idea of acting as benefactor to a brilliant mind such as 
yours.
Angel Investors
These people are wealthy individuals who look for ideas to invest in and can also act as 
mentors through the life of your business. An experienced angel can save you time and 
money with their wisdom but can also cramp your style if the deal comes with wanting too 
much control over your plans. This is important to get clear on before accepting money 
from anyone.

94    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

Crowdfunding
Groups of people visit crowdfunding sites and invest in ideas they think are worth 
spreading. You can pitch your business idea on one of these sites and hope for interest, but 
you need to understand that creating a presentation to generate that interest is a project in 
itself. Crowdfund investors need to know their money is going toward something that they 
believe in, that is really going happen, rather than folding in a couple of years. Visit each of 
these sites with a different focus, to see how fund seekers set up their presentations:
P	 Kickstarter.com: For creative projects
P	 Indiegogo.com: Creative, personal, hobbyist
P	 Crowdfunder.com: Purely investment raising
P	 Rockethub.com: Creative with campaign guidance
P	 Somolend.com: Small business loans
P	 Appbackr.com: Mobile apps
P	 Angellist.com: Tech startups
P	 Quirky.com: Creative and community building
Venture Capital
Venture capitalists are looking for big ideas and successes to invest in. This is perhaps the 
most difficult funding to obtain because they have so many businesses competing for their 
attention and require a very high minimum investment coupled with a high exit strategy. 
It is difficult for most startup eLearning businesses to fit those requirements, so it is not 
a likely option unless your idea is extremely innovative with proven extensive growth 
potential. VCs can afford to be quite selective.
Partnering
While partnering with another eLearning business isn’t really a funding source, it can bring 
a number of benefits, including some financial relief. A union of two like businesses for 
one cause, and streamlining a product together can bring double the rewards because of 
combined marketing, networking and exposure, and shared expenses. Read more about 
attracting attention for teamwork and investors in the Presentations section of Chapter 11. 
Purchase an Existing Business
There are many benefits to purchasing an already proven business model. The concept has 
had time to show it has a place in the market and that the customers support it. The brand has

had a chance to become recognizable and established. You leapfrog ahead, skipping much of 
the hard work it takes to build a strong network of suppliers, customers, and advisors—that is 
all usually included in the purchase of an existing business. Franchises come with a high level 
of training and a kit that includes many of those benefits, or at least placement in an area with 
a pre-established record of using the service. The sale of the business is structured to allow 
you to reasonably pay back debt instead of creating your own structure with the unknown 
variables of no history in the business. This allows you to just focus on running the business 
instead of tying up your time with all of those startup details. Read more about buying an 
educational franchise at: entrepreneur.com/franchises/categories/educ.html.
Ready, Aim 
Figuring out how much money you’ll need is the most difficult yet vital step in the process 
of opening your business. It is, after all, an exercise in goal-setting. You are asked to predict 
what you think will happen in the first few months of something that doesn’t exist yet. It’s 
a lot easier if you are buying an existing business or a franchise because some historical or 
average figures can guide you.
Prepare for the unexpected when charting your startup budget. If your retail business 
will be your sole source of income, you will need to bankroll money to support yourself 
until your new venture turns a profit. Typically, the amount of money you need will equal 
six months’ to a year’s living expenses for you and your family. (See Figure 6–1 on page 96.) 
Unsolved Mysteries
Some unforeseen expenses that can throw off your startup expenses projection are:
P	Increase in taxes
P	Difficulty attracting customers
P	Changes in consumer habits, preferences, and demand
P	New competition in your market that takes away some of your revenue
P	Price increases from your suppliers
P	Accidents involving you, your employees, or best customers
P	Increases in insurance, utility costs, or vital supplies like heating oil or gas
P	Lawsuits 
P	Fines

Homebased Businesses Aren’t Free
Although a homebased business won’t have all the expenses of a leased-space business, 
it is rare for any type of retailer not to have startup expenses. You will need supplies and 
business equipment. Laws and ordinances governing homebased businesses vary widely 
from community to community. Know what is required before you start yours. 
A homebased business may need a license to operate, a seller’s permit, and a federal ID 
number, depending on your industry and local requirements. You should also check fire 
Tips for Successfully Working from Home
Heather Wilson, author of the E-Learning Uncovered series (http://elearninguncovered.com)
suggests five tips to keep you sane if you work from home:
1.	 Get dressed every day. It’s good for your self-esteem, you never know when you’ll have 
an impromptu Skype call or lunch date, and it’ll keep you happy with yourself when you 
have to look in the mirror.
2.	 Get some exercise every day. Studies show brains on exercise function better. It’s hard 
science, so just do it! Fifteen minutes of sit-ups, climbing stairs, or burpees (a quick, high-
exertion exercise) can increase blood flow to your brain and help you mine new ideas 
hidden way down deep. Learn how to do a burpee here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Burpee_(exercise). One benefit of working at your home is that you can have your dog at 
work—take the dog for a walk for a refreshing break!
3.	 Get away from work at lunch. Just getting away for half an hour will give you fresh eyes 
and an invigorated second wind. A walk in the park or lunch somewhere outside resets 
your nerves and soothes the soul.
4.	 Get a schedule and stick to it. Time can drift into a vacuum at home with all kinds of 
distractions. It’s important to clearly define when you start, when you’ll break, and when 
work is absolutely over.
5.	 Get an “in the office” friend. Connect with someone also working from home or a 
professional you respect by phone for quick chats or lunch to keep you stimulated, well 
advised, and social.

department permits if you use flammable materials; air 
and water pollution control permits if you plan to burn 
any material or discharge any waste into the waterways; 
liquor, wine, and beer licenses if you sell liquor, even 
through the mail; and health department permits if your 
business involves food or food preparation.
You may be sufficiently covered under your 
existing homeowner’s or renter’s policy, or you may 
need additional insurance coverage. Check with your 
insurance agent. And to find out what tax benefits you 
may qualify for with your homebased business, seek 
the guidance of an accountant who is familiar with 
homebased deductions. He or she can calculate your cash 
needs with and without the tax deductions, in case tax 
laws change and you receive no benefits beyond savings 
on rent and utilities. 
Bank Locally
Regardless of your location, as a businessperson, 
you’ll need to set up your accounts. You want a bank that wants your business. Look for 
a full-service financial institution that caters to small businesses in general and retailers 
specifically. Your goal is to find one that has the products, services, and fees that fit your 
needs. 
The basic items you will want to compare among financial institutions are:
P	 Business checking account
P	 Business interest checking account
P	 Business savings account
P	 Cash management services
P	 Merchants’ deposit
P	 Payroll service
P	 Online banking services
P	 Lines of credit (seasonal and revolving)
P	 Small-business loans (short-term, long-term, collateral, equipment, accounts 
receivable financing, factoring accounts receivable, cosigner)
P	 SBA-approved status
tip 
There are five things an 
entrepreneur should be 
prepared to show a loan 
officer: a business plan 
that shows how you 
will use the financing to 
operate the business, 
proof that you pay your 
obligations when due, that 
you have enough equity 
money, that your team 
has enough experience to 
implement the plan, and 
that your sales prospects 
are strong enough to repay 
the loan.

Even if you’re planning on using savings to start your 
business instead of taking out a loan or getting outside 
investors, it’s always a good idea to be on a first-name 
basis with your bank for future expansion loans. Establish 
relationships with bankers at networking functions such 
as meetups, chambers of commerce, industry events 
such as those held by ATD and eLearning Guild, and 
Networking International. 
Put the bank manager and head of the loan committee 
on your mailing list; say hello or wave when you’re in the bank, and make a point to share 
some exciting news with them about sales, new personnel, or your community involvement. 
By being someone they know and respect who doesn’t want anything from them, when you 
do approach them to get some new equipment, remodel your store, or even to provide a 
reference, they will know who you are. 
tip 
Weigh the fees charged 
and services offered by 
different banks against 
their proximity to your 
business, hours of 
operation, cooperativeness 
of personnel, and the 
bank’s reputation for 
working with retailers.


Location, 
Location, 
Location
L
ocation is always significant to the success of a 
business, even distance learning. While obviously 
your customers are not coming to your location, 
you need to be in an area where you can be successful as 
a business person and where you can attract high-level 
employees (who don’t all, of course, need to be local to your 
business’ location but some will need to be).

Combine that list with Getting Smart’s (www.gettingsmart.com) “10 Smartest Cities” 
list and you’ll see a lot of overlap. This one is based on criteria such as innovation mindset, 
sustained leadership, talent development, collective impact, new tools and schools, and

Other factors such as initiatives like the Next Generation Learning Challenges 
should be part of your consideration about where to establish roots as these are signs 
of growth and promise. This new effort pairs with established Education Cities (cities

Keep track of the trends that make sense for your business. Look for news about where 
large investments are going, both public and private. Even though it can take years for 
those investments to change the landscape of education in that area, it’s wise to keep track 
and base your decisions on areas where you see patterns of growth.
Setting up an office for an eLearning business often is done by professionals who had 
previously been working from home. Young startup companies can be unaware of what 
the future holds and want to keep expenses down, but find that commercial landlords 
want a hefty commitment—usually a five- to seven-year lease agreement. Signing on for 
an extended time agreement in an office that doesn’t account for future wild cards can be 
scary. You may increase your staff five-fold in the next few years and if your space doesn’t 
fit that growth it could hurt unless you plan for that growth in staff to be mostly remote 
workers. 
Look for space that either fits your long-term growth plan or has a shorter lease. The 
disadvantage to that, though, is that your rent can and will most likely be raised at each 
lease renewal period without the safety of a long-term lease. Subleases are an option and 
can be found by searching similar businesses and teaming up with them, which is smart 
because the space is already designed for similar use.
Whether you are going to remodel or build from the ground up, consider all the things 
that will be happening in your building before choosing. Make a list of all the activities and 
their privacy, equipment, noise level, electricity, and atmospheric requirements. Here are 
some of the things that might go on at a typical eLearning office:
P	 Presentations. Show clients new product and let them engage in it in an environ­
ment that simulates the typical student environment. Demonstrations in a formal 
presentation style and individual-use stations should be accounted for as well as all 
of the AV equipment and furniture needs.

104    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

P	 Individual spaces with enough privacy and quiet 
for employees, but room and space for creative 
collaboration.
P	 Workspace trends that are designed to increase 
productivity include comfortable, relaxing, but 
social nooks near common areas. This increases 
the possibilities of “chance encounters” with other 
employees and opportunity for creativity. Creating 
a space where workers can adjust tables and chairs 
and daily restructure their space needs according to project is important. Adjustable 
desks and chairs that people can sit on or stand at reduce stress on the body and mind. 
This will factor into your choice of furniture as well as office layout. Don’t skimp on 
comfort or the psychological results will negatively affect your bottom line.
P	 Reception and greeting. The latest trends in office design encourage the whole staff to 
greet customers by making the reception area open and not separate from the offices 
so that guests can feel the energy of the hive and workers can welcome them in.
Consider making cubbies with these elements for breaks and renewed energy:
P	 A yoga station. With mats, yogi music, and meditative lights
P	 Friday lunch hour chair massage. Hiring a chair massuesse isn’t expensive
P	 Ping pong table. Ping pong is all the rage, helps let off steam, and certainly produces 
laughter, the great diffuser
P	 Pets allowed. Though some people are allergic to pets, sectioning off part of the 
building for them is smart as it can create a bonding between employees, reduce 
stress, and allow them to work longer hours when they don’t have to get home to let 
the dog out.
P	 Workout rooms and treadmill desks. Sitting is the new death stamp. It’s all over the 
news with recommendations to get up every hour for at least ten minutes. Treadmill 
desks can work if employees can share a few to keep costs down. Standing chairs can 
be used for part of the day, too. Having your office near a place to take short walks 
is helpful.
P	 Healthy snacks. Either make healthy vending available or create an opportunity in 
the break room for employees to easily make healthy snacks like smoothies, raw 
veggies and salads, or heat up or cook a community pot of stew.
P	 An altar of spirituality. One that recognizes all religions and alienates none. This 
can be a quiet, sunny meditation and prayer room with overstuffed chairs, soft 
music, candles, and spiritual art made by employees.
aha!
Creating relaxation 
stations for your 
employees need not be 
expensive and can increase 
productivity.

7 / Location, Location, Location    105

P	 Library. Not just a boring industry news library, but one that relates many other 
areas of life to eLearning with works of literature and photo albums.
Parking
If your office is divine but the parking creates a nightmare for guests and employees, this 
can be a problem. Workers can be distracted by having to move their cars every few hours or 
getting tickets, which will affect productivity. Guests can arrive frazzled, which will change 
their experience with your product or service. If you have a city location and metered or 
pay lot parking is your only option, then have quarters ready for people that need them and 
offer parking validation discounts.
B2B Partnering
Business to business relationships can make a wonderful community atmosphere. Consider 
doing a trade with the coffee shop or juice bar down the street in exchange for discounts for 
employees. You can offer trading businesses free demos of your products for their parties, 
or use of your yoga room for their employees.
Equipment
You’ll need the usual array of office equipment and will want to utilize low cost and 
creative options for this, depending on the look and feel you are going for. Some options 
for this are:
P	 Hiring a staging professional who creates displays entirely with used furniture 
from consignment shops, Craigslist, and estate sales. These people often have 
access to discounted new furniture as well and can help you come up with a 
unique look.
P	 Hire an interior design student to create your space under budget. Look at portfo­
lios and past design projects, and ask for their intended plan of operation.
Software and Hardware
There are so many software and hardware choices for eLearning providers that it’s hard 
to predict what you’ll need exactly until you finish writing your business plan and create 
some of your first courseware pieces. But here are some general categories by function that 
comprise a lot of what distance educators use.

Computers
No old technology! Be sure you have the computer power you need with the highest 
memory and largest monitor (17 to 23 inches is almost standard these days) you can afford. 
These are the things that make you efficient and effective and should not be considered a 
poor use of money. 
Laptops are important to be able to move around and give demos at changing locations. 
Laptops that serve as desktop computers with comfort features such as a detachable full 
keyboard, wireless mouse, and separate monitor that can all be detached for portable use 
Tally Up Your Office Needs
Your needs will vary depending on your output, product, number of employees, and type of

are a great way to combine all the features needed to provide highly productive electronics 
for the office.
Mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and MP3 players will let you view and 
test software you’ve built expressly for these devices in real time, as well as keep up on 
your social media postings. If your car does not have built-in Bluetooth, be sure to get a 
Bluetooth device to use for phone calls while traveling. Most states are moving to laws that 
do not allow use of any handheld devices. 
A high-quality microphone, speakers, and a headset will allow you to hold video chats 
and record audio files for sharing.
Printer/scanners get used daily in a variety of ways by most offices. It’s good to have 
access to an all-purpose one. Most contemporary printers have built-in scanners and 
copiers and are very zippy in their pages-per-minute print speed—just keep in mind that 
replacing the ink cartridges is where the real costs add up.
Ensure you have back-up drives or storage such as:
P	 Cloud storage solutions like Google Drive (www.Google.com/Drive), Dropbox 
(www.dropbox.com), or Apple iCloud (www.Apple.com/icloud) 
P	 External hard drives such as the Western Digital Raid 1 8TB My Book Thunderbolt, 
and AirPort Time Capsule.
P	 Off-site paper storage. Keep paper copies of all important data and store it in a 
warehouse or building off-site.
Software can usually be purchased by yearly subscription or flat fee, sometimes with 
options that let you store some of your data in the cloud. When it’s time for an upgrade, 
you’ll be notified and either asked to pay an upgrade fee if you’ve only paid for a year. 
Regular updates are usually free once you’ve purchased the software outright. Most 
software comes with free tutorials that can be accessed from its website. 
Because of the massive use of mobile devices to access eLearning, a shift is taking 
place in the software and services area that incorporates HTML5, a technology mark-up 
language for the internet and how it presents content. HTML5 allows users to take their 
lessons with them, accessing them on any device, and uses less CPU space and battery 
power to display interactive eLearning courses. What this means for you as you select 
software is that you have a choice to make. Do you want to go with the future and allow 
users to access your lessons everywhere or use older software and make the upgrades 
later? These authoring packages come with combinations of features to create engaging 
eLearning courses such as dynamic graphics, audio, cloud storage, marketing, sales 
processing/ecommerce, content management, mobile-design specific tools, presentation

Choosing training platform software doesn’t need to 
be hard. Make a list of what you need it to do for you 
and your clients and then start looking for a match. 
DigitalChalk demonstrates some of the basic components 
of a good platform package:
P	 Chalkboard. Helps you create mixed media pre­
sentations with video, audio, slides, HTML, and 
other images.
P	 Web archive. Allows you to embed course content 
from various media sources.
P	 Testing. Helps you create tests with multiple choice 
and true/false answer possibilities.
P	 File linking. Refers learners to stored documents 
for viewing, such as spreadsheets and PDFs, with 
a button or link.
P	 SCORM. Assists in transferring content from 
authoring tools and learning management sys­
tems.
P	 PowerPoint converter. Helps turn your PowerPoint 
presentations into lessons.
P	 Assignment collection. Lets you assign and collect

T
he goals of an eLearning website are to connect 
the learners and trainers with an elegant design 
that intuitively guides complex interactions with­
out glitches, sells the product, and conveys what the com­
pany stands for. Of course, as an online-based business, the 
pressure is slightly higher for your website to reflect the 
high quality of your courses’ online experience. While you

don’t need to spend your entire startup budget on website design and creation, do not 
shortchange the site either.
Your website should be able to display all your creativity and allow for easy technical 
solutions that don’t rely on someone who makes you wait or stays on the phone for hours 
while you lose money because of downtime. People should understand who you are easily 
and fairly quickly after landing on your site. Web design is an art that takes into account 
how many seconds a person is willing to stay on a page, anticipates the motion of their 
vision, and focuses on filling needs and capturing information quickly.
There are some great web design companies that offer sharp solutions developed 
expressly for eLearning products. Choosing the right web design provider involves making 
an assessment of your needs and going over each of the provider choices to see which offers 
the closest fit. Here are some of the things a combination LMS/web host/design service can 
offer to fill your needs:
P	 Course creation
P	 Student registration
P	 Sales
P	 Certification management
P	 Live video conferencing
P	 Tests, quizzes, and assessment management
P	 Student portals/forums
The core of your website will be determined by the LMS you choose. LMS types 
are divided into three categories: open source, SaaS (Software as a Service)/cloud, and 
proprietary learning.
With proprietary learning the upfront costs are high, but you own the design through 
purchased licensing. This is what most large organizations 
and universities use. 
Open source has fees associated with it, usually based 
on your enrollment or a monthly charge. While there are 
no fees to license it, you have to pay for hosting and the 
optimization of the software for your purposes and those 
costs can add up. Open source allows for growth and 
change because it is easily altered; for a young, growing 
company, this is a good thing. 
The benefits of using an SaaS/cloud LMS are that 
upgrades are included, storage costs are low and able 
to accommodate vast amounts of data, there is no 
save

on investment with all

maintenance, it is very secure, and once your options are chosen, deployment is very 
fast.
One option that a lot of people first starting out use is an open source LMS platform, 
which you can modify for your own purpose, and then publish and reoffer it as your own 
to the community. Moodle (www.moodle.com) is one choice of an open source LMS. 
Moodle is pretty high-end with almost any feature you could ever need in an eLearning 
website, as it was originally designed for universities. It also has the capability of using 
plug-ins for new things you’d like to try that aren’t part of Moodle’s package. Moodle isn’t 
the easiest software to learn and doesn’t have ecommerce tools built in, but it plays well 
with WooCommerce (http://woocommerce.com), an ecommerce plug-in, is very secure, 
and has lots of collaboration tools for you and your students.
Or you can build your website on WordPress (www.wordpress.com) using any of its 
LMS themes, which in essence are one-stop-shop solutions to anything you could need. 
WordPress’s theme WPLMS, also partners with BuddyPress (www.buddypress.org) so 
that you can create your own social media platform for students and teachers to build a 
community with. It uses WooCommerce as a plug-in ecommerce solution.
Another option is to build your site on WordPress and use an LMS plug-in, such as 
LearnDash (www.learndash.com), which is often paired with WordPress for eLearning 
solutions. This allows you greater flexibility in controlling how your site looks, rather 
than being restricted by the LMS theme in the previous option. A fun and useful event 
management plug-in called EventEspresso can be used to coordinate lectures and other in-
person elements of your course with the virtual. Gravity Forms is another plug-in that can 
be used with this plan to create forms to capture information. There are plug-ins available 
for many tasks that allow a more creative product.
Most people without tech backgrounds find it easiest to use a plan like WordPress 
either way rather than Moodle to set up their website if they’re doing it themselves. If hiring 
a team including IT staff is on the menu, then it’s not an issue; they can handle not just 
figuring that out but also what system will work best for your product.
Services like Capterra (www.capterra.com) can help connect you with the right 
provider to match your needs after filling out a short set of questions.

Website Components
Write down a detailed list of several goals different customers may have when landing on 
your site and how they will travel through the channels to achieve their goal. Make sure it’s 
easy and enjoyable. Ask friends and family to test navigating your site before committing 
to a design.
The same priorities other businesses use in conveying mission, introducing staff, and 
providing easy solutions for shoppers are important for an eLearning site. A wealth of 
resources, including demonstrations of your product should also be provided as well as a 
content rich blog and links to social media. Let’s look at the usual and necessary website 
components for building your relationship with potential eLearning customers.
Welcome/Home
The look of this page should convey everything about your mission, product, and branding with 
images, layout, and design. Buttons or icons to easily accessed product demos should be obvious 
on the homepage. A current website trend is featuring a huge, striking image on the welcome 
page, rather than many. A rule for the homepage is that no 
matter where you are within the site you should be able to get 
back to the homepage easily—that is the place where you can 
access everything else through a menu of single clicks.
About Us
There are advantages to putting your mission statement 
on your website homepage so that readers have a strong 
impression of what you do before they get to the About 
Us section. There they should read how each member of 
your team fits in with the mission. You can also put your 
mission on its own page and reiterate it on your team page, 
but if you’ve developed a vision statement, that generally 
works well on the About Us page.
The About Us section on your website should show 
the world your credentials, goals, perhaps how you started 
your company, and a little of your personality. Because you 
are a virtual firm, each page on your site needs to make just 
the right impression, and lead logically to the next page.
tip 
Blogging is important 
to your business. Google 
favors you based on how 
many relevant blog posts 
you create with quality 
content for users looking 
for your kind of topics. 
Do you want to be found 
and promoted to higher 
page rankings? A blog as 
part of your website will 
take the whole site to 
stardom if you’re a good 
enough writer and give 
your market what it craves 
reading about.

116    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

You and your team members should be proud of the accomplishments that have led 
you to provide your high-quality service and that should show in the content on this page. 
Listing some of your high-profile clients (once you get them and with their permission), 
significant projects, and B2B relationships here is appropriate if done in a biography style. 
A little humor or information about who you are as a person outside of work is sometimes 
appropriate, depending on what kind of clientele you’re trying to reach. You could add 
something that talks about a personal interest you have and tie it into something about 
your product, such as, “In his spare time, Jim loves surfing California’s wild coast while 
dreaming up new courseware.”
A classy, professional photo of each team member lends some solidity that yours is a 
real service and not just a business that hopes to get some action but hasn’t the real talent 
behind it. Anything you can do to set yourself apart from the degree mills and scammers 
without any substance behind their claims is good. Cross-linking to business sites you work 
with gives additional credibility.
Company Philosophy and Mission 
This is about who you are at your core. It is where your ethics intersect the products you 
sell and the way you treat the world, including customers and employees. Linking to your 
achievements in the education field, or any initiatives you support with your curriculum 
is appropriate here. Make sure this page conveys the best of what you do in credentials, 
accreditation, and any other stamps of approval from governing bodies.
Product Pages and Shipping/Checkout 
Your ecommerce solutions should be smooth and obvious. If you’ll be charging a monthly 
fee at three levels for different subscription types for learning, then make that clear and 
all in one place. Visitors to your website should be able to get more information about a 
product, or a 1-800 help line here, too.
Landing Pages 
Landing pages are where you are routed to when you click on a product for details and 
options. They are for all education about products for your customers.
Choose a Website Builder or Hire a Pro
You can design your own website with access to good photo editing software like 
Photoshop and a low-cost website building service such as Wix.com, GoDaddy.com, 

8 / Your eLearning Website    117

BuildYourSite.com, Fatcow.com, and Web.com. They offer step-by-step guides to coach 
you through the process. You can also hand over all of the responsibility to a professional 
website developer or choose a lower-cost option, such as a design student or new business 
looking for pieces to add to its portfolio. You may also have to hire a writer if your chosen 
design professional doesn’t excel in that area. Make sure to read reviews, and check 
references for anyone you are considering hiring, rather than just looking at the fancy 
work they’ve designed. Customer service is key and will mean a lot in the future when 
you need quick changes made to your online presence. Look on Yelp.com for businesses 
offering discounts, search Craiglist.org for contractors, and ask friends and relatives for 
connections to low-cost website designers.
One-Stop-Shop Solutions
Many of your needs can be covered by choosing service providers that perform several 
functions, such as:
P	 Yahoo! Merchant Solutions (http://smallbusiness.Yahoo.com/ecommerce), a host­
ing site that helps you design an online store and set up a merchant account to 
accept and process credit card orders.
P	 Volusion (www.volusion.com), Affinity Internet (www.affinity.com), and 1&1

shipping technologies, and marketing assistance.

online stores for free, with ecommerce solutions, of course.

Get Your Web House Ready for Guests
Before you set up any kind of official presence, you should be ready for guests. Think of 
it like having surprise visitors to your home. If the doorbell rings, what would you like 

118    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

guests to see when they visit? How would you like to come across to them? Would you like 
to answer the door in your bathrobe with moisturizer smeared all over your face and the 
remnants of a cookie spilled down the front of your robe? We didn’t think so. 
The way to ensure you take advantage of those first few guests is to think of their 
visits as precious. Know they may never come back again if everything isn’t impressive, 
sharp, innovative, unique, and expressing excellent quality and customer service. The first 
category to focus on to display on your site is the actual work you will be doing for others, 
in the form of a demo. It will take some time to translate your wonderful ideas to short 
demos that spark the viewer’s interest, taking care to not give away content that will make 
money for you in the full versions of the lessons.
There are several sites that coach you through building your first lessons, and some are 
free. Most of these sites have very valuable resources that can be mined for trends, industry 
connections, and webinars.

What Will Your Site Do?
The most important facets of your courses will either shine or be lost according to how 
you put your site together, deliver the information to the learner, and provide answers 
to every “why?” that comes up. The elements that create a complete, highly functioning 
distance learning website vary by purpose and goals, but there are a few general areas that 
most professionals have to consider and are essential to ensuring the learner’s ultimate 
experience. 
My website helps me by:
P	 Utilizing captured data for future connections and selling opportunities
P	 Helping me stay organized and abreast of sales/ecommerce changes

analytics
P	 Creating a professional presence and acting as a virtual business card

Big Data
Capitalizing on big data is key to understanding patterns indicating where your customers come 
from, what they look for on your website, what they buy, and what they click on but don’t buy. 
When you attach data services to your website, you access information that is like a glimpse 
inside the collective customer mind, enabling you to customize a better business for that mind 
and capture more sales. Sales processing services such as ShopKeep (www.shopkeep.com) and 
LightSpeed (www.lightspeedpos.com) also offer data collection to businesses, but it’s up to you 
to review and use the data to your advantage and change your behavior accordingly.
Offer Video
In a Business News Daily (www.businessnewsdaily.com) interview, Tom Malesic, president 
and CEO of web design firm EZSolution, said using videos can be like getting free commercial 
time and, “Consumers are more likely to purchase after seeing a video than if there was no 
video at all.” Linking your website to your own YouTube channel is a great way to extend 
the product education dialogue your website begins with customers. Each thumbnail of a 
product can show a larger image when clicked on and, as utilized on Zappos.com, a short 
video could be accessed to showcase the product in context. You can also embed videos on 
your site, but using YouTube is often easier when it comes time to make changes and update 
videos and keyword tags that search engines use to find them. Because YouTube is a Google

Ongoing Training Is Imperative
In his report, “Distance Learning: Promises, Problems, 
and Possibilities,” Doug Valentine of the University of 
Oklahoma cautions against misuse of technology, a 
common blunder among trainers.
“Besides the cost of the technology, there is the 
possibility of not utilizing all its potential. Some of these problems arise from a lack of 
training, some from the instructor’s attitudes about using the technology, and still others 
by hardware problems. It seems to be self-evident that instructors need to be trained to 
use distance learning technology, but too often they are not. Once again, it appears that 
administration may feel that the technology itself will improve the course. Advancement in 
technology does not lead to effective distance education.” Valentine adds that the skills and 
knowledge of the instructors themselves are what make the best distance learning, along 
with a complete understanding of how to use the technology and shift their knowledge to 
it.

Social Media Practices
Students who learn online already face a bit of an isolation factor. It’s important to build an 
online and real-time community that serves to make them feel part of a caring group with shared 
values. Phone calls, video chats, participating in forums, and creating special, personalized 
contributions to social media can build strong relationships with your students and increase 
their chances for success in your classroom and serve as a mentorship for years to come.
Even though business owners tend to think of social media’s role as something that 
serves their business, for distance educators it’s more than that. Because more of the truly 
important functions that are the life of the business occur online, taking relationships

seriously within the social media realm should be a priority. You can influence your 
students’ grades, participation, hopefulness about school, and outlook on life by your 
contributions to social media, which is just another way to gift your audience.
Steven Starks, senior academic counselor at the University of Phoenix lists eight 
engagement tips in his interview, “Exploring Retention Strategies for Distance Learners,” with 
The Evolllution (www.evolllution.com) to help build relationships between student and teacher:
1.	 Student success webinars. Engage students by hosting live webinars! This can be a 
meet-and-greet opportunity in which students meet their support team (academic 
advisors, faculty, etc.) or learn tips and strategies for success. Webinars can occur 
prior to the beginning of the program or throughout the entire program in order 
to enhance student preparedness by offering relevant and useful information about 
campus resources, policies, or procedures.
2.	 Supportive calls and emails. Advisors can contact students for telephonic advising 
sessions, use email templates with succinct messages that offer useful information, 
or send motivational messages.
3.	 Social media. Meet students where they are by creating a Facebook page, Twitter 
account, or YouTube channel to broadcast messages about campus news and events, 
remind students of important deadlines, or inform students of certain opportuni­
ties. Institutions could also create a blog that addresses strategies for success.
4.	 Orientation.  Design an orientation for students that provide them with a list of 
resources and contacts prior to their start date. Address expectations and orient 
students to the online environment and the resources available to them
5.	 Advisor chat. Designate specific times when students can chat with their advisor 
using an instant messaging/chat client for basic questions and answers.
6.	 Resource portal. Develop a portal that enables students to get the latest information 
or access to resources, a central location that is easy to find and use.
7.	 Establish learning communities. Learning communities can be integrated into an 
existing LMS or academic/social engagement network or created through the use 
of free resources such as EdModo.
8.	 Mine data. Measure as much as you can and use the data to make informed deci­
sions and track course completion rates and satisfaction measures.
The Channels
Christopher Pappas at eLearning Industry’s Network suggests specific ways distance educators 
can use the popular social media channels to create tightly knit communities with students.

122    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

Facebook is versatile, allowing instructors to create closed or open groups for students 
to share information, quizzes, materials, photos, or even specific courses. Talking and 
commenting about shared priorities and events is easy.
Twitter can be used as a backchannel to connect learning communities and classrooms, 
and convey massive amounts of information via resource links to highlight courses, events, 
and classes. Instructors just create an account and give its hashtag to students.
LinkedIn serves as a wonderful arena for many educators across the miles to confidently 
share knowledge, tips, problems, and developments with qualified colleagues. Joining the 
Instructional Design & E-Learning Professionals’ LinkedIn group is recommended.
Google+ is used heavily by both learners and facilitators because it isn’t as easy to get 
distracted there as on Facebook and Twitter. It is a social media channel that keeps studies 
separate from the social context—a lot of people prefer not to mix these—and Google+ 
provides a way to do that through the use of “circles.”
YouTube offers a special opportunity to convey teaser videos of lessons, refer students 
to watch videos that support in-class materials, and create mini-tip tutorials and separate 
coaching for students, at an individual or group level, personalizing the delivery of material.
The channels you choose are not as important as what you share on them. Meaningful 
content relevant and valuable to current and future students is the most important thing to 
give, whether it’s through a blog or just a casual photo post. Following experts such as trade 
magazines and professional blogs can inspire you to create better content on your own pages. 
Hootesuite.com can help you view all your channels in one place, look for patterns in your 
audience’s and student’s needs, and collaborate with team members on group projects. This will 
naturally shape the products you develop. Interacting with posts is important, too. Rather than 
just posting something and looking at the comments people make, get invested in a meaningful 
conversation that can be continued in a real-life event through Meetup.com—a great place to 
create a real-life end of the course celebration for your students.

Seven Tips for Hiring Smart
Be aware of these seven points from eLearning Industry on evaluating potential hires for your 
team:
1.	 Do they have work samples? Even newcomers to the field should have work samples to 
show you, even if it is just from an intern or volunteer project.
2.	 Experience is as important, if not more than a degree, or skills. Rounded real-life skills 
in dealing with clients, accountability, and long-term completion are honed by doing, so 
ask.
3.	 Think about character, manners, and personality and how theirs make you feel—it will 
matter in the long run when you have a stressful project, need extra tenacity on the job, 
and are in the spotlight.
4.	 Meshing with the team is important. New hires need to be able to feel comfortable 
communicating and taking direction from your team. Do they seem socially engaged and 
happy or concerned and challenged upon meeting your team?
5.	 Are they passionate about education? Is this the kind of person who feels excited about 
taking new courses and studying up on everything you have to offer? It’s easy to spot a 
faker. Someone insincere will not have been very proactive in learning and that shows up 
on a resume.
6.	 Is the candidate comfortable with the technology and tools you use or will the learning 
curve be distractingly steep? A little bit of challenge is expected when taking a new job, 
but if there is no foundation, sometimes it just doesn’t come together.
7.	 What kind of references did they give you? It’s nice to be able to hear about how the 
candidate functioned on a team, overcame a challenge, completed a tough project, or 
went out of the way to help someone.

to do everything yourself? Can’t afford to hire any help? Think again.
Hire Smart
As the quantity of work to be performed increases, you must hire employees. Elearning 
coach Connie Malamed (www.theelearningcoach.com) advises to hire smart. She says three 
people is a good starting size for a team and to manage your initial budget to its maximum 
potential, look at which jobs warrant only part-time hours. It’s possible to turn two jobs into 
one with the right employee, but be careful not to overload or you may get a nasty surprise. 
Many employees who feel overworked keep it to themselves, feeling that if they let their 
Malamed’s Recommendation for Building an eLearning Team
P	Project Manager. Oversees the full life cycle of the project, interfaces between internal 
client and eLearning team, schedules deliverables, and ensures the team has the 
information and resources it needs to get the job done. Provides the business analysis to 
ensure that solutions are aligned with business and organizational goals.
P	Instructional Designer/Writer. Uses instructional design, cognitive psychology, and adult 
learning theory to determine the appropriate solution to a knowledge or performance 
gap. Analyzes content, organizes content, designs solutions, and writes storyboards, 
scripts, performance support, mobile learning, and manuals. Knows how to use social 
media and collaborative tools to facilitate learning.
P	Editor. Helps to improve overall writing; proofreads all writing
P	Graphic Designer. Creates the user interface, graphics, and animations; designs the look 
and feel of courses, learning portals, mobile learning, and print materials with an eye 
toward the clarity required for learning and information dissemination.
P	Media Specialist. Produces and edits audio and video when required for a project.
P	Authoring Tools Specialist. Assembles all the elements into a running course, adds 
interactivity, and ensures the course can interface with an LMS, if required. With the 
advent of rapid tools, some instructional designers handle this role.
P	Tester. Runs quality assurance checks by testing the course from a technical perspective 
and ensuring it matches the storyboard.

employer know, they’ll look incapable. They fear getting fired, pay cuts, and losing prestige 
and responsibility.
As your company succeeds, you will need to redefine condensed job roles and divide 
them up into single occupations. When you start out, you will handle the lion’s share, if 
not all, of the business functions. Small businesses often divide the work in half: You, as the 
owner, manage the operations, and you’re assisted by someone who creates the product. 
As your business grows, you will probably need a project manager, operations manager, 
instructional designer/writer, editor, graphic designer, media specialist, authoring tools 
specialist, and course tester. 
You don’t want to wait too long before hiring a general manager to relieve you of some 
responsibilities. Hiring the right professional at the right time will ensure that all the jobs 
are getting done, which makes the business more appealing for the client and employees 
alike. If you are not able to get answers for customers back to your salespeople in a timely 
manner, this frustrates customers and costs sales. 
Assessing Your Needs
The frontline employees interact with clients, so they are, in a sense, your face. You may be 
your own salesperson and instructional designer, and also may run your entire company. 
But if you don’t, keep these things in mind when deciding how to staff your enterprise:
A full-time instructional designer (ID) on staff is paramount. This person should be 
“in the trenches through every phase of your projects,” says Justin Ferriman of LearnDash 
(www.learndash.com). In his article “Why Every Company Must Hire an Instructional 
Designer,” Ferriman points out that an on-staff ID becomes almost instantly indispensible 
after having absorbed most of the company knowledge and priorities. “Think about 
how much of an asset this individual immediately becomes to [the] employer. They now 
know the entire training program intimately from start to finish. How to edit content, 
where content has come from, why it exists, who the target audience is, and much more! 
Maintenance and quality assurance alone become much less costly to the organization 
because they have their own expert on-the-ground.” Additional benefits to doing this are: 
being able to update, refresh, and keep current training materials without hiring outside 
help (from a noninvested source) at higher rates.
How Many People Is Enough?
The quick answer is as many as it takes to ensure complete customer satisfaction. In reality, 
simple economics preclude this. There are as many answers to personnel needs as there are

types of training businesses. Nonetheless, here are a few 
points to consider in deciding how many staff members 
your business requires:
P	 Type of business. Is your company destined to 
be a Fortune 1000 or sole divisional learning 
service? Either service requires calculating pro­
duction hours and dividing that by your startup 
budget with a reasonable allowance for profit.
P	 Type of product. The higher the price and com­
plexity of the product, the more personal selling 
is required. More personal selling means more 
people.
P	 Operating hours. The number of workdays and 
the hours of business may require shifts and 
flexible work times. Changes in holiday busi­
ness will also affect staffing.
P	 Participant density. The more students enrolled 
in your courses, the greater your need for train­
ers and more development. 
P	 Business location. A homebased business increas­
es its chances of experiencing zoning problems 
with every employee it adds.
Hiring
The first phase of hiring is the more impersonal aspect 
of personnel administration: creating plans, formulating 
policies, and setting up procedures. This involves 
recruitment, selection, hiring, compensation, employee 
health and welfare, maintaining personnel records, 
and the like. Then come the more human aspects of 
managing human resources—the personal, in-the-flesh 
people business.
A natural tendency of many new business owners 
is to hire family members and/or friends as soon as help 
is needed. Be cautious if you are thinking about doing 
warning 
One trainer we talked to 
went out on a limb to refer 
her casual friend to an open 
position in her company. 
This friend was new, seemed 
capable, and had a cheery 
attitude. She also seemed 
to be very supportive and 
interested in the opinions 
of others. The disaster 
occurred when shortly after 
she was hired she used 
profanity on a client, snarled 
at a project manager, 
and refused to follow 
instructions on a project. 
How could this happen and 
how could it have been 
avoided? Knowing someone 
for a long time or having 
worked with them at length 
on a substantial project are 
good ways to get a genuine 
feel for their character and 
work ethic. Many people 
who are eager to please 
to get what they want can 
come across as whatever 
they think you’re looking for. 
Don’t go out on a limb for 
anyone who doesn’t have 
clout! You can jeopardize 
your reputation.

this. Loading your eLearning staff with “your tribe” ensures your team will be a bunch 
of people with a similar mindset and perhaps background, which may not be to your 
advantage. It’s good to have a variety of thinking and learning styles at work to create a 
rounded product and introduce ideas you may not have cooked up on your own. The extra 
effort required to build good communication between co-workers can translate to honed 
customer communication skills. 
Hiring people from your friend and family circles is also dangerous because if 
something goes south at home, you can be certain it will carry over into the office, even with 
the most professional work ethic. By the same token, if you are having a very challenging 
month at work, do you want your entire system of relief to be tied up there? The very 
friends you relish cutting loose with on weekends can turn into serious connections with 
too much attention paid to editing conversation and vice versa, worrying about feeling too 
comfortable and bringing your social sense of relaxation or sense of humor inappropriately 
into the workplace.
Grow your team slowly with professionals who have solid skills and experience to add 
to the team, and then project more work based on already having the talent to support it. 
It’s better to stay focused and put out a steady, high-quality product, with all aspects of the 
client relationship covered in a breathable way than to get as much business as possible and 
then figure out how to do it.
Where to Find Talent
This is where any time you’ve spent networking can turn into gold doubloons. Just because 
you have a LinkedIn profile and can peruse for good candidates online doesn’t mean you’ll 
get what you need. LinkedIn is only as rich a resource as your real relationships to people 
on the site and the same goes for other online-based networks. There are other real life 
networks that function just as well as LinkedIn, so it’s just best to focus on a formula, rather 
than which site you think has the best mining potential for employees.
The Formula: Make the Golden List
Think about the networks you’re already involved in, or have been involved in, in the past, 
rather than suddenly joining associations and trying to grow instant solid connections. 
Make a list of projects on which you’ve worked with outstanding professionals, even if 
they are unrelated to your current subject matter or distance education. Add personal 
relationships to that list of anyone you know who is respected in her field. Next, add relevant 
relationships you’ve developed through social media connections. Think about your formal 

9 / Human Resources    129

education and continuing training—there should be a lot of pros you can connect with from 
that source. When you’ve finished making a contact list of all of those important people, 
put the word out about the kind of skills you’re looking for, in addition to the experience 
required to do the job. By not just focusing on the job description, you’ll get a wider variety 
of capable people to choose from, and then you can decide if training them the rest of the 
way makes sense.
Networks Teaming with Talent 
Networks are strong in the training industry. Educators are people who go to learning 
events and are frequently involved in communication; after all, these are people who thrive 
on stimulation. So, make a list of organizations that act as networks for trainers. Start by 
looking at trade journals. The list below shows just a few of many:
P	 eLearning Network (www.elearningnetwork.org)
P	 eLearning Guild (www,elearningguild.com)
P	 Training magazine (www.trainingmag.com)
P	 NYIT School of Education (www.nyit.edu)
P	 Connecticut Distance Learning Consortium (www.ctdlc.org)
When the time arrives to hire higher-level employees such as assistant managers, 
buyers, and bookkeepers, you need to be more imaginative and aggressive in your pursuit 
of qualified personnel. LinkedIn, trade journals, professional association newsletters, and 
relevant industry websites are good places to find seasoned, skilled, relevant prospects, 
often with referral status. Discussing your needs with suppliers and other educators is 
another way to find employees who can often hit the ground running.
Labor Practices
A person who operates a business with employees outside the immediate family must 
comply with a host of statutes regarding fair employment practices. These statutes relate to 
things like terms of employment, safety on the job, provisions for retirement, and workers’ 
compensation and unemployment insurance. The fairness principle requires that decisions 
related to employees aren’t made arbitrarily and that policies are applied equally to all 
employees. The law gives employees certain rights, and as an employer, you are responsible 
for knowing the law and abiding by it.
Some employees working in large companies belong to unions that represent their 
common interests. Consult your lawyer and SBA counselor regarding labor laws in your 
state.

130    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

Hiring Procedures
There are several methods for hiring and evaluating 
potential employees. Educate yourself on proper hiring 
procedures. Information on this subject is available 
at local libraries, community colleges, Small Business 
Development Centers, employment services offices, 
career development centers, and seminars.
Make sure your job announcement is attractive, 
accurate, meets government equal opportunity criteria, 
and is listed in the right places. Each job posting 
should be well thought-out to emphasize the positive 
aspects of the job, including benefits and potential for 
advancement. The medium used to advertise positions 
should be tailored to the job type and the type of person 
you hope to hire. For example, if you are looking for 
an experienced instructional designer, you may want 
to run an ad on LinkedIn.com. If you’re looking for an 
entry-level candidate, you might be targeting writers, so 
advertise on in writers’ forums and local writing salons 
or schools. You can also pass the word along to current employees to suggest friends 
or acquaintances, work with employment agencies, or list the opening with the state 
Department of Employment Services or on the web.
Some firms pay a bonus to any employee who brings in a new hire. Others spend 
thousands of dollars on classifieds, only to report that word-of-mouth referrals still seem 
to bring in the best candidates. Outstanding salespeople must be recruited, developed, and 
then shown they’re appreciated.
It is often easier to train inexperienced people to function in a unique way in your 
company than to hire those seasoned in the field who have developed staff standards or 
habits that aren’t relevant to your needs. Productivity can be developed in candidates 
who have a few desirable traits: friendliness, attention to detail, persistence, patience, and 
creativity. For example, Diane Elkins says her team at Artisan E-Learning has trained 
themselves much of the way. They met at those precious jobs that acted as matchmaking 
services for the skilled and motivated, setting them up for future project teamwork that only 
their imaginations set limits on. She has networked with friends and relatives and hired 
both and then trained them where needed. “It’s just important that they have the right skill 
sets. I don’t believe you need a master’s in instructional design to work in this field. I would 
tip 
Great leaders keep 
educating themselves; 
so lead by example and 
start a book club for your 
employees that will light 
their imaginations. Create 
a list of dynamic reads 
that spark creativity and 
hold book club meetings 
during the Friday lunch 
hour, with a potluck option 
or something great to 
eat. Watch your regular 
employee meetings take 
off with new ideas and 
confidence.

rather hire someone who is a clear thinker, who can organize content logically, work with 
subject matter experts, and organize their rambling thoughts into organized content. That 
person needs to be able take a jumble of information and categorize it—the same goes for 
folks in storyline development. It matters if they know how to use the tools and have good 
graphic design skills first, and we can train them for the rest.”
If they’re good, they have the patience and know-how to listen and work with people.
Auditioning talent can be more revealing than a series of interviews. Asking serious 
candidates to work on a short freelance project with your team is worth the investment of 
a short hire. Putting candidates through slightly stressful auditions can be an opportunity 
to see how well they’ll perform and be able to shift gears in the future. See Figure 9–1 for 
information about advertising for jobs.

Background Checks
There is no crystal ball to ensure that the employees you hire 
will be loyal, honest, and hard-working. It is wise to screen 
applicants more thoroughly than simply asking them to 
fill out a job application and calling a few of the person’s 
friends. Since everyone from the content developer to the 
IT staff represents your business, you should either verify 
an applicant’s background or hire someone to do it for you.
Howtoinvestigate.com is an online organization that 
outlines information sources and procedures for you 
to accomplish a background check. Local investigation 
firms can also be found in your town with a simple Google 
search, as well as through your police department and 
lawyers association. They will do background criminal 
checks on prospective employees for about $50 to $250, 
depending on the agency’s fee schedule and how many 
jurisdictions the agency checks. 
Verifying Employment Eligibility

Employee Compensation
According to the U.S. Department of Labor’s 2014 tally, there are 133,780 instructional 
coordinators working across the U.S. today. Their average annual salary is $64,040 and their 
average hourly rate is $30.79. They develop instructional material, coordinate educational 
content, and incorporate current technology in specialized fields that provide guidelines to 
educators and instructors for developing curricula and conducting courses. They also act 
as educational consultants and specialists, and instructional material directors. Because this 
occupation requires a lot of flexibility and skill sets, it is a good sampling of what it is like 
to work in distance learning. The average weekly earnings of all full-time wage and salary 
workers in every profession combined were $784 in the first quarter of 2014, compared 
to the weekly instructional coordinator earnings of $1,231. Note that though the average 
salary is $64,040, 90 percent of instructional coordinators made $95,590, and 10 percent 
$37,000.
Most full-time employees expect health coverage, paid time off for illness or vacation, 
and some perks like paid educational opportunities, trade show attendance, and product 
or service discounts. Without offering some benefits in your compensation package, you 
will find it difficult to compete for quality employees. When considering what to offer

your workers, compare the perks with the costs of high turnover—decreased morale, time 
interviewing new employees, training new people, interruption of customer service, public 
perception of instability, loss of person’s know-how, etc.
After They’re Hired
Once you have invested the time and effort in recruiting and hiring skilled new employees, 
don’t rest on your laurels. Your work’s not done! There are several things you can do to 
ensure your diligent hiring efforts don’t go to waste.
Lack of communication between management and employees is a big mistake and 
all too common. Don’t let your business fall into this common trap. Regular company 
meetings are a good way to improve the situation. These gatherings are great settings 
for educating employees on new products or services. Let an employee explain and 
demonstrate benefits and features of your products. Have employees tell you what 
Do What it Takes to Keep Your Team Happy
Care about how your staff feels. It’s important to be a leader and to push and challenge 
your team, but if you have unrealistic expectations and only care about the end result, 
your product, you are not only being selfish, you’re also being careless about your talent 
investment. You may find that after never hearing so much as a peep of frustration, your 
employees are quitting, and have other jobs lined up. Follow these tips to keep your flock 
from fleeing:
P	Pay them what they’re worth. Look up salary averages for your area and match them. 
Don’t underpay or you’ll foster growing resentment.
P	Reward and acknowledge achievements, whether it is with a gift certificate or bonus.
P	Find out what’s both relevant to company growth and personally important to 
employees and support those goals as best you can. Investing in upgrading employee 
training always makes them feel valued and when personal goals intersect with what’s 
good for the company, you have a smart investment.
P	Hold one-to-one meetings with each employee every six months or more often. Ask how 
they feel about potential obstacles, where they are going, if they have the help they need 
to complete projects, and what they are excited about. If you only get answers designed 
for Brownie points, ask, “Just between you and me, honestly, what would you change 
about your role here if you could change anything?”

features or products they observe customers liking or disliking and what they hear 
customers asking for that may not be ready to release. Employees should be told about 
new developments in the curriculum and want to be asked for their opinions and see 
some of their ideas implemented.
Provide Incentives to Employees
Employees should constantly be encouraged to perform in a quality manner. When you 
or a customer is pleased with an employee’s performance, let everyone know about it. 
Personal and public recognition has a multitiered affect. It communicates what you value 
to your workers and customers, which can generate more achievements and satisfaction. 
Some rewards the companies we interviewed use are treating a star employee to a lunch, 
bonus, afternoon off, or reserved parking. You will be hiring from the same labor pool as 
other local businesses. How can you get your employees to perform better for you? Your 
acknowledgment, rewards, and overall management will make all the difference.
The Employee Bible
Here are some of the topics you should cover in your employee manual:
P	Company philosophy and mission
P	Company benefits, including medical care, time off, discounts, and allowances
P	Hours of operation and reporting hours
P	Procedures for reporting an illness, absence, or family emergency
P	Dress code
P	Standards of behavior regarding smoking, alcohol, drugs, gum-chewing, language,

P	Telephone etiquette

Employee and Operations Manual
Operating a training business can be very gratifying 
and stimulating, but without effective management 
procedures, it can also be a lot of headaches. If you put the 
proper systems in place so that your store is more or less 
on autopilot, you’ll be successful. The reason franchises 
generally work well is that they use proven systems; all 
the new operator has to do is follow the tried-and-true 
policies. 
An employee and operations manual provides the 
information your people need to do their jobs and play 
by the rules. It gets employees off on the right foot and 
instills in them habits you want to see rather than those 
you want to break. 
Many trainers are extremely dependent on their key 
staff members. If a management person leaves, sales suffer 
because of the knowledge that walks out the door with a 
valuable employee. Turnover is expensive, and training 
new staff is a tedious, time-consuming process. Written 
operating procedures that explain how to perform the 
day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, and year-
to-year jobs involved in running your store will help 
smooth employee transitions.
By having a guide for employees, you eliminate uncertainty about what your company’s 
policies, procedures, and guidelines are. This can be of particular importance when you 
need to put an employee on probation or fire someone. Clearly stated policies can protect 
you from the litigation that is all too common in today’s world. 
For the most part, the educated professionals you’ll attract to your team will not need 
to be informed of a dress code, and the casual corporate style most smaller companies 
go with today is simply a look that is tidy, comfortable, and respectable. But if for some 
reason you have a great team member who doesn’t have a clue about personal hygiene 
or too revealing clothing, it’s a smart idea to have had them review your basic decorum 
or style standards agreement, rather than subjecting everyone to a dress code. Clients are 
influenced by every personality in your company and judgments can be made quickly 
about your entire organization based on just a small detail, such as chipped nail polish or 
stained clothing.
aha!
Consider hiring an intern. 
Interns can be paid with 
“free” education, training, 
and certificate earning 
opportunity. Because 
interns are usually 
temporary employees, 
their time with you is one 
big controlled audition, 
without the large price tag. 
Of course, interns must 
be paid at least minimum 
wage, according to the 
U.S. Department of Labor, 
but that is a far cry from 
most distance learning 
salaries and bonuses like 
education can make up the 
difference. 

140    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

Managing the client’s mood is not a small task. 
Management of the client experience starts with the 
first point of contact. A warm greeting from an alert, 
knowledgeable, and attentive (but not pushy) salesperson 
will make customers want to do business with you time 
and again. 
Probation
It is customary to hire new people on a probationary 
basis. This period should be relatively short—for 
example, 10 to 90 days. This time allows you to evaluate 
the new employee to measure their progress and to 
determine if they will fit into your organization. A 
probationary period also provides incentive for new 
employees to prove themselves and to learn their jobs 
quickly and well. 
Training
When new employees are hired, they should be trained 
in a well-thought-out and thorough manner. To begin 
orienting them to your way of doing business, give 
them a complete tour of the facilities, explaining what 
their role is in each area, what procedures to follow, and 
things to watch out for. Take new employees through the 
entire company from the front door to the back. It is 
important that everyone understand how their job fits 
into the overall scheme of things and what each person’s 
duties and responsibilities are so people will work well together.
Continue training on a regular basis. Training is an investment in the future—your 
future. With rapid changes in technology and the psychology of learning, products change 
frequently and the challenge to employees to keep up with them is great. 
Encourage employees to stay informed about the latest trends in your industry 
by reading trade journals and industry news. Send employees to trade and consumer 
shows to pick up new ideas, interact with other businesspeople, and promote your 
business.
tip 
Make sure to give the new 
hire a bio and contact list 
to refer to, containing 
each member of your staff, 
their title and role in the 
organization, and their 
contact information. If you 
don’t already have one of 
these, then make one, and 
if it has photos, so much 
the better. If employee bios 
are listed on your website, 
refer the employee 
there. This will give an 
understanding of how the 
whole system works and 
shorten the learning curve, 
making the new hire feel 
more comfortable and 
able to focus on the work. 
Make sure all employees 
are on the list and that it 
is complete and updated 
regularly.

Scheduling Personnel
Scheduling employee hours when you first start might be challenging until you really have 
a feel for how long it takes to create and manage each product, but as you schedule for each 
project, and perhaps begin with on-call contractors, you’ll know what is required when you 
start operating at a higher, more consistent level.
Full-time employees work 30 to 40 hours a week and are usually paid at a somewhat 
higher hourly rate than part-time employees (or they are paid salary). Full-timers provide 
continuity for your business and help develop your customer base for you. They generally 
have multifaceted skills in many areas of training and education. They may have a little IT, 
a lot of writing, some content development, and other bits of experience. These employees 
make a commitment to your business and have regularly scheduled hours and days of the 
week. 
Part-time employees may work year-round or with increased hours when you need 
extra help. They can be scheduled for your heavy-traffic hours and days or on an as-needed 
basis. These workers are frequently students, retired people, or parents of school-age 
children, and their schedules can be set to accommodate school and/or seasonal schedules. 
Establishing four-hour shifts allows you the flexibility of having people work partial days as 
well as adjusting staffing needs. Some of your part-time workers will stay with you for years 
and provide exceptional service.
Invite employees to submit schedule requests and make every effort to accommodate 
them. However, don’t be casual on the accountability side. Let employees know you are 
counting on them and expect them to arrive on time and ready to work. Overstaffing, 
understaffing, and no-shows disrupt other workers and can jeopardize your business. By 
maintaining detailed sales, traffic, and staffing records, you can analyze what’s working 
and what isn’t. From year to year, you’ll amass figures that will help you maximize your 
resources and opportunities. 
Employee Performance Appraisals
Annual employee evaluations help you zero in on the strengths and weaknesses of your 
business. At the same time each year, set up appointments with your employees to review 
their performance. Give each employee a self-evaluation form to complete and return to you 
prior to your scheduled meeting. Then, review each employee’s answers and prepare your 
points for discussion. These will include expectations for the job, personal achievements, 
areas where effectiveness could improve, how you can help the employee do a better job, 
and the employee’s new performance objectives.

142    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

From the information exchanged during the 
performance appraisal process, you will get a clearer 
view of how well your hiring, training, and management 
practices are working. You will also gain insight into ways 
to motivate employees. This is often a time when new ideas 
for the business surface and aspirations for promotion 
are revealed. Performance appraisals also provide the 
opportunity for clearing the air about misunderstandings 
or mistakes and for starting fresh.
The laws protecting workers’ rights are complex and 
can easily be used against you. Check with your lawyer, 
local Small Business Development Center, and other 
advisors to ensure you understand what you can and 
cannot do in terms of firing an employee.
If you feel you need to discipline an employee, the 
first thing you need to do is meet with the employee 
and give him or her a verbal warning. The next time 
the employee exhibits behavior that goes against your 
policies, meet with the employee and provide him or her 
with a written summary of things the employee must 
and must not do and a time period within which the 
employee must correct his or her performance. This is 
known as a written warning. Keep a copy of the warning 
that clearly states that if the behavior is not corrected, the 
employee may be terminated. Ask the employee to sign the warning, acknowledging the 
understanding of your expectations. If, after these measures, the employee’s performance 
has not improved in the ways you outlined in the verbal and written warnings, you may 
have to fire the employee. 
Be humane if you have to let someone go. Meet in private with the employee and 
tell the person the exact reasons for termination. Create an atmosphere of fairness, if not 
compassion, and have the employee’s final paycheck and paperwork ready to make a clean 
break.
aha!
Unless an employee steals, 
destroys property, or 
causes safety problems, 
immediate dismissal 
for poor performance 
isn’t a good idea—
legally or managerially. 
Communicate in a gentle, 
clear way, what is going 
wrong and how to correct 
it. Create a written record 
of these communications 
in the unfortunate event 
that the employee chooses 
to ignore the criticisms. 
You need a paper trail to 
show proper procedures 
were taken, and fair 
opportunity to improve 
was given, if you have to 
fire someone.

Give 
Great 
Content
Y
ou can either create your own content or buy it. 
In either case, it has to be relevant to the learner. 
This is why you should be sure to work hard to 
define your audience, including conducting surveys and 
focus groups and paying attention to the results. 
The first thing to do to get your hands on great content 
is write down what your objectives are, rather than focus 
10
C H A P T E R
143


on the information you want to convey (e.g., “help people become safer drivers” rather 
than “the faster your speed, the greater distance you should leave between you and the 
car in front of you”). Second, make sure that your objectives are really what your market 
wants to learn. Third, you need to understand how it will be using the new knowledge, 
because that may change what you teach, the way you teach it, and how long you make it. 
For example, if your objective is to make it easier for employees of a lawn care products 
company to convey information to customers about your products, then ask them how 
long they typically talk with customers and what their most asked questions are. Then you 
can build a short content product that delivers the answers to the most asked questions the 
customers have in a short time frame. 
Your content should give no more and no less information to the employees who need 
it and let them test their knowledge quickly. For the lawn care scenario, your interface 
should be designed for mobile apps because employees will likely be roving the store and 
need information on the fly; they’ll also probably be taking your short courses in-between 
doing other things. Finally, analyze whether the content you have planned accomplishes 
your shared objectives with the customer. Before launching the product use a test group of 
real salespeople and ask them if it solves their problems.
Your Class Must Match Program Goals
Just because you know your subject doesn’t mean it will be a snap to write your coursework. 
It’s important to structure an outline for what you will teach, with enough room to 
demonstrate a clear path to how learning objectives will be achieved. Whether you are 
designing your classes to train clients independently or writing a proposal to be accepted as 
a staff member at a teaching facility, you must clearly show how your class matches the goals 
of the existing program. If you are designing smaller, light tutorials as an add-on service 
or benefit to your business, be sure you clearly define how they support your business and 
what need they fill. Figure 10–1 on page 145 can help you plan.
In developing her syllabus, Schuh had to rethink how she structured her ideas. “In 
designing workshops I was accustomed to outlining activities more so than learning 
objectives. For the university I was challenged to more closely consider teaching 
outcomes—what the students were expected to do upon completion of the course. For 
example, following eight weeks of study they would ideally be able to identify their beliefs, 
fears, experiences, and attitudes that influence equanimity and anxiety surrounding their 
own mortality. And if I were successful in teaching the students, they would be able to 
implement a plan to ultimately assure congruence with their unique vision of a life well 
lived. These are just two of several intended objectives.”

How the Brain Learns
We’ve all experienced the brain-dead syndrome while studying something that doesn’t 
seem interesting but we have to learn it. The information seems to go on forever but we 
can’t absorb it and then, as if by magic, we begin reading or hearing something that truly 
interests us and find we can recite the whole thing backward and forward just from a few 
minutes of totally engrossed exposure. 
The onus is on you to find ways to make the dull information more interesting! If 
you can find captivating methods for teaching the most mundane information, students 
will flock to your classes. On the other hand, you also have to be careful to ensure the 
presentation of your material does not make it seem less important. This is where the use of 
gaming techniques for online coursework can be extremely useful and worth investing in 
the expertise to help you create such a curriculum approach. More on gaming techniques 
below.
Motivate, Capture, Personalize
Use opening statements, questions, and statistics that demand a dramatic response. 
Demonstrate why the information should matter to the student. Show them how their 
lives will be different and what they’ll be able to do better after the course. Use real-life 
examples of how this has already happened. These opening communications should be like 
the first few pages of a gripping mystery—it should be impossible to not go forward. Set 
their imaginations loose to run wild.
Be a Master Storyteller
Use as many dramatic, funny, or entertaining stories as you can to convey your material. 
People remember stories and retain their information longer than dryly-presented facts.
Use Striking Images and Infographics
Illustration of the concepts you are teaching always helps. A picture, as the saying goes, 
truly can be worth a thousand words. If you find your lesson is droning on and on with 
boring text, think through whether a graphic or image might better convey your message. 
It is worth whatever you need to pay for the graphic (be sure not to just use photos and 

148    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

graphics without permission—just because it is on the internet does not make it free for 
general use).
Cartoons can be great for getting concepts across. Again, if you find the perfect cartoon 
online, be sure to ask permission to use it. Many cartoonists can be hired to do work 
specifically for your content at a reasonable fee.
Chunking
There are reasons phone numbers are grouped into small sections. We have a greater 
chance of memorizing the small sections than the whole jumble of numbers at once. Giving 
learners only a paragraph or two at a time to read is especially important on a computer, 
which strains the eyes and competes with easy distractions like surfing the internet and 
checking email.
Procession Graphics
These are the clickable icons or text that the learner uses to advance the page. Out with the 
old and in with the new. Getting rid of material already read and only seeing new material 
gives a sense of accomplishment and confidence, as does seeing the accomplished modules 
or sections below the lesson, and how many are left. Being able to move backward and 
staying on a page as long as they want allows readers to customize their learning. This is one 
of the reasons self-paced learning is achieving higher absorption rates online, in addition to 
relieving the stress associated with having to “hurry up and learn!”
Summarize, Summarize, Summarize
Small groupings of information should be together in the chunking method we just mentioned. 
After each section, the learner should get a summary or bullet list of the key learning points. 
This reinforces the important parts of the information and ensures absorption.
Turn It into a Game
Part of the testing process can be turned into a game. Gamification is a huge trend in 
eLearning right now because it is fun, helps learners stay focused on the material, and has 
measurable results. Did you get eaten by the dragon or didn’t you? Here are some websites 
that do it well:
P	 Nursing Simulation (www.suddenlysmart.com/examples/Patient_Management/
player.html). Screen patients and recommend treatment.

camera teaches users how to use one.
P	 Design a Cell Phone (www.edheads.org/activities/eng_cell). Analyze market research

Test Their Thinking Frequently
Following a series of multiple-choice questions, and before the actual testing, give them 
frequent opportunities to give answers in short composition-style bursts. Asking them to 
convey their understanding in writing re-exposes them to the lesson and having to write it 
reinforces it to memory. You can give some guidelines to help coach them, such as showing 
some sample answers or restricting answers to three sentences, etc. Hint boxes can be 
available to click if they need them.
Blended Learning
“Blended learning” refers to the combination of instructional delivery via in-class situations 
and online learning. Depending upon what kind of eLearning business you are creating, this 
might be something you could incorporate. Or perhaps you could do this with a specific 
class that you can teach both in your community and online and use the physical classroom 
setting for useful face-to-face interaction and feedback gathering about your class. 
The Perfect Synchronous/Asynchronous Salad
While many classes are either completely synchronous with everyone in the class sitting 
down at their computer at the same time or completely asynchronous where students take 
the entire class on their own schedule, a combination of the two can make an online class 
much more interesting for students. The topic of your class and the typical student that 
might be taking that class will determine how much synchronous class time is enough. 
Many students are drawn to eLearning specifically because it is flexible, so don’t make your 
class so inflexible with specific class time that you turn away your core potential students. 
Design It for Cell Phones
Cell phones have become the tablet-of-choice for many people, especially the younger 
generation. Smartphones are becoming bigger and bigger to accommodate this life between 

150    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

the traditional compact cell phone and the tablet computer. Keep in mind that many of 
your students are taking classes online because they have busy schedules and are on the go 
a lot. eLearning fits into their busy lives. An entire industry is built around creating mobile-
device-friendly versions of websites. Make sure you are on that bandwagon—it isn’t just a 
fad, it is real life. 
Study What Fails
Course content that is dated or hard to understand is distracting and erodes confidence in 
the teacher. Your content should at the least be proofed by a subject matter expert (SME) 
and focus group tested. Ineffective objectives lead to ineffective results. According to 
LearnDash (www.learndash.com), you should consider this before writing yours:
P	 The multiple objectives for the entire initiative; high-level or end-game objectives, 
course objectives, and individual lesson objectives.

P	 Sequence and order are important in the planning stage. Each objective accom­

course objective. Course objectives satisfy a program objective.
P	 Students should be clear about the takeaways.
Verified Certificates of Achievement
EdX, the “nonprofit online initiative created by founding partners Harvard and MIT,” 
launched a Verified Certificate of Achievement. This document is for a list of eligible 
courses that, for a fee, provides verification of your identity and completion of the course. 
It enables students to provide proof to potential employers or current employers offering a 
promotion that they have taken the course work. Think of it as the online official transcript, 
one course at a time. 
Keep in mind that edX courses are free. While students can still have proof of their 
participation in a class, the verification process provides a proof that students can show 
with their certificate.
Think about certificates for your classes if you feel this would enhance your 
marketability. Self-enrichment classes do not need this level of certification but classes 
that might result in employment promotion/raises or even employment itself can be more 
desirable with certification.




Marketing
Y
ou need to expose your business to gaps in the 
market, knowledge-hungry audiences, and acci­
dental customers—those who weren’t looking 
for you but could consider you invaluable after they know 
about you. Here are some ways to do that.


Start with What You’ve Got
Utilizing a network you already have is a start for creating a bigger one. You can take a 
few connections and turn them into hundreds, with work. If you went to a vocational 
school after high school, consider remarketing yourself to that school as a virtual trainer 
for their current students, especially if you’ve excelled in what you learned there and can 
contribute in the field knowledge that might not be learned in the classroom. Go back 
to past employers who were happy with your work and tell them what you’re doing. Ask 
if they know anyone who could lend support to your efforts. Calling a trade association 
and asking for short, informational interviews with the heads of the organization can lead 
to connections to other people and great advice. Sending out a newsletter to friends and 
family announcing your goals can unearth new connections.
Passive and Active Marketing
Passive and active marketing are two different ways to show the world what you’re doing 
that achieve very different results. Passive marketing includes market researching places and 
people to put advertising in front of, calculating and creating the ads, then connecting them 
to planned entities like mailing lists and specialized audiences. Some examples of this are:
P	 Print ads for magazines, newspapers, and trade publications
P	 Digital ads for websites with like-minded services or products
P	 Radio spots aired when and where your target audience listens
P	 TV commercials aired during programs your target audience watches
P	 Coupons sent to customers already involved in some aspect of your industry
P	 Online directory or phone book ads
P	 Paid advertising on sites like Yelp, YouTube, and Facebook
P	 Fliers and one-page info sheets for distribution through other businesses or at 
events
P	 Video demos of your product on YouTube or websites you have a relationship with
P	 Offering freebies as lead generation on your social media site and website
Some of the benefits of passive marketing are that it can be done on your own time, 
in your own way, and requires less social energy. Giving presentations requires a number 
of steps like getting to the event, lots of small talk and remembering names, being cheerful 
and “on stage,” being prepared for any question, being armed with promotional materials, 
and dressing impeccably. Passive advertising just requires that you create the ads, or have 
them created, send them to the right places, keep track of analytics, and act on those results.

11 / Marketing    155

Active marketing is about engaging with people face-to-face and harkens back to the 
days when salespeople or tradesmen went from village to village, talking up their wares. 
They had conversations with people in each town about how their products would function 
in unique situations and how they could help the client. Often people would gather around 
in a town square and the peddler would put on a show, dramatizing the effects of the 
miracle product. They only had a short time to get their message across so they made the 
most of it, calling up nonbelievers to the stage and demonstrating with showy results to 
make the crowd gasp in wonder. After the crowd was hooked they’d talk about a special 
deal with some sort of commitment: “Buy two now and get the third free.”
Though snake oil is not your game and your distance learning offerings are nothing if 
not honest, holding this old timey method of storytelling and presentation in your mind as 
you move forward is wise. Think about only having one opportunity to tell your story with 
each new audience you get in front of to make the most of the words you choose, the tools 
you use, and the way you use your personality to plant seeds in their minds.
One of the biggest benefits to active marketing is immediate feedback. There in the 
faces of your audience you see how they feel, whether they laugh at your jokes, whether 
they are rapt in your fascinating content, or if they check their cell phones over and over as 
you present. You don’t get this with passive marketing. You only know if the viewer took 
your bait and where they hopped off the boat. Another benefit is removing several steps of 
communication if someone is interested. If you’re at an event and someone likes what you 
do, they may approach you and talk about it as opposed to sending out a mailer, waiting 
for calls, playing phone tag and then taking a few discussions to determine if the potential 
client really wants what they think you have.
Another benefit is that you are delivering a memorable experience to the audience that 
passive marketing cannot, and if done right, at a fraction of the cost. 
Some examples of active marketing are:
P	 Focus groups made up customers you already have, or a select group of your target 
demographic
P	 On-site, impromptu promotion. This could happen at a seminar you are conducting 
and be accidental when a client asks a question that leads to you further investigat­
ing and promoting a new solution on the spot.
P	 Bringing an event to a customer. This could be something like creating an app for a 
party or event that engages people and teaches them something quickly.
P	 Speaking to a group for educational purposes and gifting them your knowledge. 
P	 Holding an event through Meetup.com. Find your target audience “club” and treat 
them to something special that both helps them and showcases what you do. An 

156    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

example of this would be hosting a webinar in person for a group of writers or par­
ents, if you teach writing or teen education.
P	 Offer your products for a prize for a contest or charity auction.
Finding Your Audience
You might be wondering whom you should invite to these wonderful presentations, and 
whom you should focus on for your passive marketing. Creating a list of your core potential 
customers involves looking hard at what you do and creating branches to everyone 
connected to it. Not everyone you target will function as a direct customer. Many people 
may solely be supporters and promoters of your business. 
When deciding what the balance of active and passive marketing for your business 
should be, consider what each will generate for you, how long it will take to work, and how 
much money you have to sustain it.
Consider This One-Hour-a-Day Formula
Mathematician Richard W. Hamming’s (1915–1998) speech “You and Your Research” gives 
insights into what it takes to develop society-changing contributions over a lifetime. The idea 
expressed below can be applied to any field where complex problems are to be solved and 
discoveries are to be made. Through the speech he paraphrased great lessons he’d learned from 
colleagues. At one point in his career, Hamming was jealous of a colleague and said,
“How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?’’ His boss, mathematician 
Hendrik Wade Bode, said, “You would be surprised, Hamming, how much you would 
know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.” Hamming took it to heart and 
formed the work ethic he illustrates below. Take this concept seriously if you want to 
make a major discovery or contribution, and be miles ahead of the pack.
“Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. Given two people of 
approximately the same ability and one person who works 10 percent more than the 
other, the latter will more than twice out-produce the former. The more you know, the 
more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more 
the opportunity—it is very much like compound interest. I don’t want to give you a rate, 
but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person 
who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously 
more productive over a lifetime.”
P

11 / Marketing    157

If you choose to use a combination of several of these methods, remember that your 
ads and presentations should convey a consistency with your brand, and with one another. 
Each method should contain an action step and a way to track if that is working and what 
the return on your investment is: “Buy 10 lessons now and receive a 3-hour personal tutor 
session by clicking here.” To track whether the rise in business you see is because of this ad, 
you can assign a tracking URL to the “Click Here” button to that campaign on your site as 
well as use a different phone number for it.
Lesson Number One: Sing Your Song 
Tie your shoes and start marching! Really. Get off the couch and make a list of the face-
to-face experiences that will enhance your business in the areas of teamwork, exposure, 
funding, and further development. Active marketing is about getting in front of people 
with your ideas, needs, and identity. It’s about creating a valid presence in your community, 
which can extend beyond your city and state to include the community of educators all over 
the U.S. in your niche area. Some examples of active marketing are:
P	 Create a series of short demo videos that capture the essence of your curriculum 
and a presentation that conveys your mission. Take it to schools, corporations, and 
industry networking functions.
Create When You’re Creative—What?
The science of creativity is a complex one, but scientists who study the creative process have 
identified some of the key elements that allow great ideas to come up through the mind, into a 
place where we can access, make sense of, and use them. Consider the following factors the next 
time you’re creating a marketing pitch, designing a lesson, or just hoping for new inspiration.
Dopamine, a brain chemical that helps you feel bliss, focus, and motivation, is influenced by 
factors that you can control. While this is not a direct health recommendation, as we are not 
doctors, we think it’s prudent to understand the power your body and actions have on your 
brain to be the smartest, most highly functioning entrepreneur you can be. Getting eight or 
more hours of undisturbed sleep per night, exercising at least 30 minutes per day, decreasing 
sugar and caffeine, removing stress from your life, and correcting a magnesium deficiency can 
help increase dopamine. Read more about what you can do to balance healthy brain chemistry 
at Natural Health Advisory (www.naturalhealthadvisory.com).
P

P	 Write an article that features your work as a tool that solves a problem. If your 
product is an app that teaches people how to make healthy food in ten minutes or 
less, add a 60-second video clip to your article and send it out to a parenting and 
health-conscious demographic. Yoga studios, fitness-training associations, after-
school programs, and libraries would be good places to present.
Relaxation
Alpha waves in the brain increase when we relax, as in really relax, not sit in a hammock 
stressing about all the work we are not getting done. As we relax, our brains can unwind 
and reframe a problem without the threat of disaster if we choose the wrong solution or 
get it done fast enough. Some ideas for increasing alpha waves include meditation, yoga, 
biofeedback training (read more at www.mayoclinic.com using the search box), and 
binaural beats (read more here: www.binauralbrains.com; and listen to free beats here: 
www.mynoise.net/noiseMachines.php). Read The New York Times article, “Relax! You’ll Be 
More Productive” by Tony Schwartz, at www.nytimes.com.
Capture
Great minds report getting some of their best ideas while doing other things, like sleeping, 
exercising, showering, or driving. Keep a notebook or tablet with you at all times or learn 
how to use voice memo on your smartphone—pull the car over or jump out of the shower 
to record your jewels before they fade away. Try to use the same notebook rather than 
stashing several in opportune places. This will help you see the progression of your ideas 
and be able to organize them into something fully usable like a presentation.
Presentations
Carl Tyson attributes a large part of Thinkwell’s development success to telling people about 
the company concept. Seems simple, right? You have this great idea, you try to attract team 
members to help develop it, you seek investors through some research and networking—
but something’s missing. Really, when you put your ideas to work in a traditional mission 
statement or advertising spot you are just selling the part of your idea that wants money. 
What you need to do is sell your passion, sell the enthusiasm that made you fall head over 
heels with your business idea. 
In each step of the development process it’s important to find an audience of 
people with similar interests and tell them what you are doing. Just being you and 

11 / Marketing    159

loving what you are doing isn’t enough. You need to get up on a stage and present your 
life’s work as the dramatic theater piece that it is. After all, if your idea is spectacular 
enough for you to devote the coming years of your life to, then doesn’t it stand to 
reason that others could be as excited as you are? Conveying why your idea needs to 
come to life—or if it’s already moving ahead at full speed, then why it needs to grow—
is as important as nurturing friendships in your personal life. Interacting with peers 
multiplies everything: chances for success, funding, business opportunities, growth, 
and rich development.
In a way, your marketing efforts should parallel your quest for financing and building 
a team, and the three can sometimes be accomplished together. Presenting your idea at 
conferences like South By Southwest (SXSW, see www.sxswedu.com) in Austin, Texas, can 
attract the attention of big players in the game. Many of the major publishers, philanthropic 
donors, educational policy makers, universities, and angel investors are represented at or 
are attending conferences like this one. SXSW hosts include the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation, Microsoft, and McGraw-Hill Education, to name a few.
To develop your marketing video, webinar, or presentation, you need to be inspired. 
Even if you’ve already created your calling card, it would be wise to watch presentations 
from other inspiring people with unique ideas. It can shape how you present yourself if you 
study what works and what doesn’t in others’ presentations. Here are some places to view 
conceptual videos, and to develop the approach for pitching one of your own:
P	 The Do Lectures is an exciting venue is for “movers and shakers, disrupters and 
change makers” to tell their stories. It focuses simply on people who do amazing

Even though their contributions vary greatly, it seems the

thing they have in common is a desire to share knowledge—that great kindness that is 
responsible for the evolution of our species today. Here are a few of their stories and sights 
on the future.
Change the World
Mitch Braff’s filmmaking background producing works for PBS and corporate clients primed 
him for what would be a great contribution to eLearning. In 2000 he met a Jewish partisan and 
decided he wanted to capture this monumental part of Jewish history while Jewish partisans 
still lived to tell their stories. He then interviewed more than 50 Jewish partisans from around 
the world to create an educational series of videos illuminating the strength of the human 
spirit over bigotry and oppression, with the help of educators, filmmakers, and designers. 
Braff also founded the Jewish Partisan Educational Foundation (JPEF, at www.
jewishpartisans.org) in 2000, which educates students about these 20,000 to 30,000 Jews 
who fought back against the Nazis by “blowing up thousands of armored convoys and 
thwarting the Nazi war machine in countless ways. This information has the power to 
transform people’s perception of the Jewish experience during the Holocaust.” By spreading 
this information JPEF celebrates and encourages heroic resistance against tyranny. This 
program designed for grades 6 through 12 is being implemented in Jewish and secular 
schools worldwide. The series reaches more than 8,500 educators worldwide, supplying 
them with educational material on Jewish resistance. What a contribution to education!
In response to the completely preventable, high number of traffic deaths at railroad tracks, 
Operation Lifesaver, Inc. (OLI) of Alexandria, Virginia, created a series of interactive road 
safety training modules that act like video games. OLI targets training to professional drivers 
to help them make life-saving decisions at railroad crossings. According to spokeswoman 
Marmie Edwards, the education reaches somewhere around 100,000 of drivers per year and 
will eventually reach all truck drivers, saving countless lives. Some education actually saves lives.
In 1979 Dr. James “Milo” Milojkovic left his home in Melbourne, Australia, and travelled 
half-way around the world to pursue the remarkable adventure of earning a doctorate in 
psychology at Stanford University via full scholarship. “While I thoroughly enjoyed the rigors 
of a world-class graduate education, I still found it disquieting that I had to leave my family 
and friends in order to attend the lectures of my new professors. Little did I realize that this 
would spark a life-long interest in the profound challenges of education and the fascinating 
potential of a technology solution for distance education,” says Milo.
After founding the first electronic university, The Electronic University Network, in 
1985, Milo went on to eventually found his own leadership development and organizational

transformation consultancy, KnowledgePassion, Inc., “With the advent of the internet 
[I] became once again fascinated with the potential of online learning, especially when 
broadband became available in people’s homes. Through a partnership with the wonderful 
people at a German company, Mediacode GmbH, I co-designed a new, state-of-the art, 
private membership, video platform called Athena (www.athena.mediacode.net) designed 
primarily for me to use with my private executive clients at KnowledgePassion (www.
knowledgepassion.com) and later made available for everyone who wished to showcase 
and sell their expertise online,” Milo says. Athena serves as an education presentation 
platform with everything an educator needs to teach, and all materials easily accessible 
and organized for the student in a straightforward arrangement. The educator only has to 
deposit the content into the template and it is an almost instant, finished lesson. Teaching 
videos can be made on the spot and below the video are links to all related materials so 
conversations that refer to other sources are easy to have. 
Live and Learn
It’s possible to learn from the mistakes of others. Diane Elkins recounts some key aha! 
moments in her history as an eLearning professional. In the first case she learned how 
important keeping a close tab on finances is. “I know of two small businesses where an 
employee was embezzling money and another situation where a contractor was billing for 
hours not worked. So it’s important to have checks and balances in place,” Elkins says.
In terms of contracts and getting paid, Elkins has this to share: “I had a short-term 
project where we only did two billable milestones because it was supposed to be a six-
week project. Because of client delays, it sat at 90 percent done for almost a year. We had 
incurred our costs for 90 percent of the work but had only been paid for 50 percent. So now 
we make sure we include more billable milestones, even on a short project. It doesn’t mean 
we have to bill them separately—we might send one invoice for all milestones met that 
month, but we have the option.
“Another client had approved the course and we wrapped up the project. We sent the 
final invoice. Our contact left the company. Her boss got the invoice and wouldn’t pay it 
until we could prove that we had our original contact that approved the work. Fortunately, 
we had her approval in the email. We learned to never make approvals verbally.”
Julie Dirksen cautions about legal issues, “I think the legal issue that always comes up 
for me is the messy area of intellectual property—when I sign an agreement, what rights am 
I signing away? This is a particularly relevant issue for knowledge workers, as all their value 
is tied up in intellectual property. Handling intellectual property is a messy area in the 

164    Start Your Own eLearning or Training Business

legal system right now, anyway, given our current remix culture. I know other consultants 
who have walked away from work because the IP clause was too restrictive, and it’s hard to 
know what is yours vs what is your client’s when you do design work.” 
Carl Tyson believes that “interesting ideas attract interesting people. And again, 
it is really important to be working in the right type of place. In Austin there are many 
opportunities to share ideas with others and get feedback and to make connections. When 
someone makes a presentation at SXSW.edu they find dozens of people who are interested 
in the same areas and perhaps can become teammates. It is important, I believe, under 
any circumstances, for the founder or founders to have a clear vision they can express to 
others—that vision may change over time but it is difficult to attract talented people to your 
efforts without a clear mission statement.
“A lot depends on the situation in the local area—there are many different sorts of 
networks, but the important thing, again, I think is expressing a vision and attracting 
interest in how that vision might be built. The most important thing here . . . after having 
a great idea, is to spread it as widely as possible and talk to as many people in person or 
online about the vision. There will be many, many false starts but you have to persist. It 
takes a lot of work to get to the right mindshare with the right people. Does not happen 
quickly so you have to stay at it . . . even when it seems no one is listening.
“I have found key members via almost every route imaginable. Recruiters, web posting, 
chat rooms, trade shows. The key is to follow up with people. The first person you talk to 
might not be right but they can lead you to others and you can spread your network to find 
the right folks.”
Salman Khan created a video lecture series for his nephew who was having a hard time 
with his studies and that led to Khan Academy, an incredibly successful website where 
students can access any kind of education immediately and chart a course to completing a 
module. The website keeps track of learners’ progress and encourages them to finish. Khan 
said in a recent Huffington Post article that he will never tell his son that he’s smart. He believes 
that struggling to learn makes the brain grow, much the same as working a muscle tears 
down the fiber and builds it back bigger than before. He is convinced that mindsets toward 
learning matter more than the subject matter and says researchers have “found that neural 
connections form and deepen most when we make mistakes doing difficult tasks rather than 
repeatedly having success with easy ones. What this means is that our intelligence is not 
fixed: and the best way that we can grow our intelligence is to embrace tasks where we might 
struggle and fail.” What he wants people to know is that if they embrace struggles, they can 
learn anything. So go forth and create challenges for yourself and your students—growth is 
inevitable. We are looking forward to seeing what you create!

J
ust as you can never have too many eLearning and train­
ing facilities from which to choose, you can also never 
have too many resources. Therefore, we present for your 
consideration a wealth of sources for you to check into, check 
out, and harness for your own personal information blitz as you 
prepare to make your mark in the eLearning industry. These 
resources will get you started on your research. They are by no 
means the only sources out there. We have done our research, 
but events, websites, and businesses tend to move, change, fold, 
and expand. As we have repeatedly stressed, do your homework.
