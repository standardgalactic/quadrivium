 Introduction 
 To succeed in today’s global and highly competitive economy, asset optimization in real estate management 
has become a strategic task. Organizations need to ensure full visibility into their property portfolio, make 
informed decisions, improve portfolio performance, and reduce compliance costs. Increased global 
competition has elevated the need for sophisticated solutions for handling changing consumer demands, 
global workforce management, information management, compliance adherence, leasing management, and 
property management more effectively. SAP Flexible Real Estate Management (SAP REFX)    is a full-featured 
and integrated solution enabling the effective management of real estate and greater insight into one’s 
real estate portfolio. The application addresses all phases of the real estate life cycle, including real estate 
acquisition or disposal, portfolio management, and property and technical management. 
 This book provides insights intended to make the SAP REFX journey more relevant and fruitful. 
Furthermore, it can help decision makers, such as chief intelligence officers (CIOs) and chief experience 
officers (CXOs), with the important tasks of creating a business case for management approval and 
designing a roadmap for the organization. It also provides a comprehensive understanding of what SAP 
REFX is and is useful for ensuring the preparedness of teams involved in REFX implementation and rollouts. 
The book explains end-to-end real estate configurations, functional system landscapes, implementation 
challenges, and post go-live precautions important for optimizing one’s investment in SAP REFX. 
 This book is structured as follows: 
 Overview of the Real Estate Industry: Evolution and Trends 
 Master  Data Objects

 CHAPTER 1  
 Overview of the Real Estate 
Industry: Evolution and Trends  
 This chapter will provide an overview of the  real estate business, its information technology (IT) challenges, 
and the need for a strong and integrated business solution. The chapter will further provide details on why 
a real estate business needs a comprehensive IT solution, and on the benefits of implementing Real Estate 
Flexible Management (REFX). The chapter is divided into the following topics:
• 
 Overview and evolution of the real estate industry  
• 
 Need for IT solutions 
• 
 Challenges with existing available solutions  
• 
 Need for an integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution    
 Overview and Evolution of the Real Estate Industry 
 Real estate is defined as “property consisting of land and the buildings on it, along with its natural resources 
such as crops, minerals, or water.” The business of real estate includes the buying, selling, or renting of land 
or buildings. 
 The real estate sector assumed greater prominence with the liberalization of the global economy, 
and the increase in business opportunities and labor migration led to a greater need for commercial and 
housing space. Demand for real estate is driven by population growth, employment opportunities, income 
levels, interest rates, and access to capital. The real estate landscape is changing because of urbanization, 
demographic changes, sustainability, technological changes, and the changed financial system. These 
changes have major implications for the real estate industry, increasing the size of the real estate asset base 
via huge investments. The profitability of individual companies depends on property values and demand, 
which are both impacted by general economic conditions. 
 The real estate industry has been instrumental in the overall growth of core infrastructure in last few years, 
and the trend shows a continuance of development globally in all geographies. The conventionally residential 
housing sector was first to grow, but now development in retail, hospitality, and commercial sectors is occurring 
at a much faster speed. The growth in the hospitality and retail sector (hotels, resorts, shopping malls, and 
so on) is also the result of the growing middle class, the changing habits of society, and rapid urbanization. 
Governments worldwide are focusing more on the development of tourism, resulting in more investment in the 
construction of hotels, malls, multiplexes, and so forth. Cross-country travel to obtain cheaper medical services 
has grown medical tourism and has resulted in the construction of hospitals and medical centers. Educational 
institutions are established to attract students from global markets. The information technology boom and 
outsourcing to provide low-cost services resulted in a huge investment in call centers. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ OVERVIEW OF THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY: EVOLUTION AND TRENDS 
2
 The real estate sector in developing countries is at a crucial juncture of its evolution. A significantly 
large portion of the industry is still influenced by unorganized retail players, but there has been a consistent 
rise in the share of organized players, with the number of companies growing in recent years. The global 
spread of many industries and the foreign direct investment in the real estate sector have contributed to a 
fast transformation of this sector over the past decade. Dynamic entrepreneurs have moved out from their 
traditional cities to major cities across the globe to expand business and capture global markets. This has 
resulted in a huge demand for real estate and the exponential growth of the sector. 
 Over the past few years, the real estate industry’s strong growth has resulted in an increased demand 
for real estate consulting and advisory services. This includes brokerage services to enable the leasing of 
property, research, analysis and valuation support for real estate investors and developers, and relocation 
services. Real estate companies may provide expertise in either residential or commercial properties. 
However, many of them deal in both to expand their business sphere. 
 Real estate is riding on massive growth, and more and more players are entering into the market to 
reap the benefits. With this boom, a lot of real estate solution providers are emerging into the market. CIOs 
of real estate companies are on the hunt for the right technology solution, which can increase productivity, 
reduce costs, and enhance efficiency. The success of today’s real estate organization depends on accurate 
information that provides deep visibility into past and future performance so as to improve decision making. 
Without accurate data, there is a strong risk of experiencing a reduction in operating income and return. 
 Need for an  IT Solution  
 The main requirements of any real estate solution would be as follows: 
 Management of Real Estate 
 The key objective of any real estate player would be to manage the real estate efficiently and in a cost-
effective and optimal way. The real estate solution should help in achieving this objective. A complete view 
of master data — from location and size to value and usage — has to be provided so as to manage and maintain 
it. The SAP REFX solution provides a dual view of master data (both architectural view and usage view) to 
enable the management of all types of real estate objects, like a business entity, land, building, or rental 
object; i.e., pooled space, rental space, or rental unit. The assignment of various real estate objects to REFX 
master data is simple in nature. 
 Contract Management 
 The management of contracts with different stakeholders is an essential activity from a legal and statutory 
perspective. Real estate players deal with different vendors from whom they take a property on lease, and 
various customers to whom property is leased out. An IT solution should enable the effective management 
of these contracts to ensure legal, accounting, and statutory requirements are met. SAP REFX covers 
multiple business scenarios where contracts such as lease-in, lease-out, security deposit, vendor/customer 
contract, or GL contract are required, and such contracts can be configured in the system easily. 
 Space Management  
 Space management forms a key part of any real estate business. The real estate player should have complete 
details of architectural hierarchies and structures, usage considerations, and technical facilities before 
planning to rent out property. The IT solution must have the capability to capture and provide these details. 
SAP REFX provide options to capture the complete details of the property, which ensures the optimum 
utilization of the space.

 Lease-in/Lease-out  
 The lease-in/lease-out process is one of the key processes in any real estate business. When a real estate 
player takes land on rent from a landlord for a specific period of time, the process it is called a lease-in. The 
lease-out process is when the real estate player rents out the space to their customer. The lease-in process 
enables a cash payment to the landlord and the accounting of expenses to the appropriate account, whereas 
the lease-out process lets you deal with cash flow from a tenant and the posting of income. The solution 
should be able to support both of these processes. 
 Reporting 
 Another requirement of any real estate player is that of  reporting  . The reporting needs to be in categories 
such as operational, accounting, legal, and statutory reporting, including occupancy report, valuation 
report, report related to tax, days outstanding report, and so on. The solution should be able to cater to all 
such reporting requirements. For example, it should be able to generate an occupancy report that provides 
details of properties that are vacant as well as the vacancy duration so as to find reasons for the vacancy 
and take corrective action to avoid notional loss. SAP REFX caters to multiple business requirements by 
providing an exhaustive reporting system. 
 Challenges with Existing Solutions 
 The real estate industry may be bifurcated into different sectors, like commercial, residential, retail, and 
hospitality. Each of these business types has different business models, requirements, and challenges. A 
solution provider must understand the business dynamics and critical business requirements of each type of 
business. Real estate solution implementation is not merely a technical initiative driven by the information 
technology department, but rather is a complete transformation initiative to be owned and driven by the 
entire organization. 
 As major real estate players are aggressive in tapping the market, most of them handle several projects 
across the city and nation. Hence, it is impossible for them to keep track of the properties purchased and 
sold and the management or development of on-going projects in all locations. Today, IT has transformed 
the way property business is done, and technology has provided tools to keep a check on all of their needs. 
Real estate solution providers have helped them to enhance the whole process through their innovative 
solutions. Also, there are several other solution providers that assist the real estate sector with their end-to-
end support products. Such software helps their clients to automate business workflows, building strong and 
everlasting relationships with existing and prospective customers. 
 However, a major concern for real estate players is the sustainability of IT systems, which are expected 
to meet business demands over a reasonable period of time. The challenge of higher IT infrastructure 
spends amid decreased budgets hampers enterprises from effectively responding to an evolving IT 
infrastructure. Currently, real estate companies rely on various internal IT systems and product vendors 
to create new offerings and successfully run the business. This leads to maintenance overheads and an 
increased dependency on third-party products. 
 Need for an  Integrated ERP Solution 
 Currently, solutions are available in the market that address multiple requirements of the real estate 
industry, like accounts receivable, billing and invoicing, planning, reporting, expense management, and 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM). But a single integrated solution addressing all the requirements 
of the industry is a must. There is a need for scalable ERP solutions with functionality designed to solve 
real estate industry – specific business challenges, with solutions tailored to every real estate market and

meeting the complex requirements for retail (shopping malls and strip malls), franchises, commercial, and 
real estate investment trusts. Existing SAP modules like Financial (FI), Project Systems (PS), and Sales and 
Distribution (SD) are able to take care of real estate requirements, but they are not able to specifically meet 
the needs of real estate businesses. SAP Asset Accounting captures details of assets owned by a company 
but does not specifically focus on real estate assets; i.e., land and buildings. Businesses require detailed 
master data regarding land and buildings, with details like quality of land, value, architectural details, and 
measurements, which are provided in minute detail by SAP REFX. Containing not only the appropriate 
master data, but also contract processing, accruals/deferrals, rent adjustment, sales based settlement, and 
so forth, the SAP REFX module is the perfect solution for the real estate industry. Real estate assets constitute 
a major component of the asset value of an organization and need to be monitored effectively. SAP REFX 
provides this with strong integration with the financial module.  
 Summary 
 This chapter provided an overview of the real estate sector, its evolution, and the key requirements that any 
IT solution needs to provide to manage a real estate business effectively. We also discussed the challenges 
with current IT solutions and the need for an integrated ERP solution to meet the expectations of a growing 
real estate business. Also, we saw how SAP REFX meets these requirements and is the suggested solution for 
any real estate business.

 CHAPTER 2  
 Master Data Objects 
 This chapter will elaborate upon master data concepts and the different real estate views available in the 
Flexible Real Estate Management module. In this chapter, we will discuss the following:
• 
 Architectural view 
• 
 Usage view 
• 
 Business entity 
• 
 Land/Building 
• 
 Rental object 
• 
 Business partners and their roles 
 The Flexible Real Estate Management (REFX) module is robust in managing real estate properties 
for activities and processes like leasing, property maintenance, and so on. The main master data in SAP 
REFX are business entity, property, buildings, and rental units, which are controlling objects and are called 
 RE-Objects . 
 In order to understand the master data concepts, let us consider the following business scenario. 
 Vistala Reality Limited, a renowned real estate builder in Mumbai, India, has taken a plot of land on 
lease for 25 years from Puna Multinational Retail. Vistala Reality Limited has constructed a shopping mall on 
that plot of land. The shopping mall, Vistala Shopping Mall, consists of three floors and an open parking lot. 
The entire first floor is let out to a multinational retail store. The second floor is divided into multiple shops, 
which are let out to different stores and a bank ATM. It also consists of a lobby, which is commonplace. The 
third floor has a common lobby, a multiplex, a cafeteria, and a bank ATM. As shown in Figure  2-1 , the mall is 
constructed on a piece of land, and some part of the land is converted into parking spaces.  

CHAPTER 2 ■ MASTER DATA OBJECTS

■ Note   The preceding example will be used throughout the book to explain different concepts. 
 The master data in SAP REFX, in which users can process real estate objects, is divided into two views:
• 
 Architectural view 
• 
 Usage view 
 Architectural View  
 T-Code: REBDAO 
 Architectural views represent the overall architecture that is meaningful and can be represented from a 
variety of viewpoints, all of which can be combined to create a holistic view of the system. The architectural 
view represents the actual architectural framework of a real estate object, taking into account all of the 
chronological changes relevant to its usage. This is an informative view that is used to integrate with external 
designing software like Computer Aided Design (CAD) and also defines the space measurements, which 
then flow to the usage view. 
 Figure 2-1.  Concept of master data in SAP REFX using example 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MASTER DATA OBJECTS
7
 It is not mandatory to maintain the architectural view, but it has to be defined before you can create the 
usage view. We can implement the architectural view in the following situations:
• 
 Detailed information about the architectural structure of the real estate object is 
required to be maintained in the system. 
• 
 The usage of the objects changes frequently. In this case, the architectural view 
remains constant and new usage objects are created as needed. In our scenario, the 
second floor of Vistala Mall has four shops that have been leased out to four different 
stores. In the future, the Vistala Mall management may combine two shops and lease 
it as one. In this case, the architectural object would not change but the number of 
shops that could be leased out would be three instead of four. 
• 
 Graphical systems such as CAD are required to be mapped to the real estate system.    
 The architectural view is a technical view of your real estate. Using SAP REFX customizing, the following 
master data can be defined for the architectural view:
• 
 Locality 
• 
 Land 
• 
 Building 
• 
 Floor 
• 
 Part of building 
• 
 Space (such as parking space, storage space, office space, and so on)  
• 
 Area 
 Referring to our scenario, the different master data that constitute the architectural object are locality, 
building, property, floor, area, and space. Figure  2-2 depicts the architectural objects related to our scenario. 
 Figure 2-2.  Master data in the architectual view 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MASTER DATA OBJECTS

 Usage View 
 This is the accounting view in which the actual postings will happen in SAP. The usage view forms the basis 
for all object-related information used to represent real estate objects in the system. The following master 
data can be created for the usage view:
• 
 Business entity 
• 
 Property 
• 
 Building 
• 
 Rental object 
• 
 Pooled space 
• 
 Rental space 
• 
 Rental unit 
 Now that you have a high-level understanding of the master data elements of the usage view, let us 
review them in more detail. 
 Business Entity  
 T-Code REBDBE 
 The highest element in the hierarchy of the usage view is the business entity. The business entity is usually 
made up of a group of buildings and properties sharing the same utilities and subject to the same tax 
regulations. The business entity is assigned uniquely to one company code and is the starting point for 
creating the usage view structure. It can contain any number of buildings and properties, which are unique 
within the business. 
 Let us take an international airport as an example, which consists of multiple buildings and areas, like 
terminal buildings, commercial buildings with duty free shops, parking spaces, control tower, fuel depot, 
open piece of space used for runway, di-icing area, pre-threshold area, and so on. If we are implementing 
the SAP REFX solution for rental and space management, then the international airport will be defined 
as a business entity. Let’s look at another example — a large housing complex that was constructed by an 
organization for its employees. It has multiple buildings, roads, a community center, swimming pool, and 
club house. In order to manage allotment, maintenance, and capacity utilization, the organization has 
implemented SAP REFX, and the large housing complex will be defined as a business entity. Coming back 
to our previously mentioned business scenario, Vistala Shopping Mall will be defined as a business entity in 
SAP REFX. 
 Land  
 T-Code REBDPR 
 Land is a physical piece of land, and as part of a business entity it refers only to the land itself; it does not 
include the buildings on it. Sometimes land is also referred to as property. The system automatically creates 
land as an internal controlling object, as they are account assignment object. This object forms the basis 
for renting land or parts thereof, such as parking spaces or storage spaces. SAP REFX land master data is 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MASTER DATA OBJECTS
9
detailed and intensive. It provides various screens to capture data related to general data/building law and 
usage/economic balance/values/posting parameters, quality of the land, land values, and municipality and 
topographical location, as well as data on building and usage rights. These fields are used for capturing land 
details only. In our scenario, the parking area will be defined as land/property. 
 Building  
 T-Code REBDBU 
 A building is part of a business entity. The system automatically creates a building as an internal controlling 
object, as they are account assignment objects. Buildings, or their parts, are the basis for renting spatial 
units, such as apartments, warehouses, and stores. SAP REFX building master data is detailed and intensive. 
It provides various screens to capture general data/additional data/fixtures and fittings characteristics/
posting parameters, and so on. We categorize the building according to its type and condition; describe its 
fixtures and fittings, characteristics, and area usage; and enter important dates (such as construction year, 
start and end of construction, date of modernization, etc.). You can also assign a building to a profit center or 
a business area.  
 Rental Objects 
 T-code (REBDRO) 
 Rental objects comprise three objects: 
• 
 Rental unit: A rental unit is created when one unit is to be leased out in totality 
and is treated as one complete piece. In our scenario, the entire first floor of Vistala 
Shopping Mall is leased out to a multinational retail store and hence we will define it 
as a rental unit. 
• 
 Pooled space: This is the total space available from which we can take rental spaces 
for lease-out. We can have a proper regulation in the space that can be leased out as 
pooled space and will allow the exact rental spaces to be rented out. In our scenario, 
the pooled space will be defined to represent the complete floor area. 
• 
 Rental space: A space extracted from a pooled space for lease-out. In our scenario, 
the second and third floors of Vistala Shopping Mall are divided into multiple 
smaller spaces and rented out to multiple stores, a bank for an ATM, a multiplex, 
and a cafeteria. We will define rental spaces to represent the multiple smaller spaces. 
For example, we have pooled space (PS1) of 1000 square feet, out of which one 
rental space (RS1) of 400 square feet is extracted. Now the system will only allow the 
creation of rental spaces that will have an area of 600 square feet total. 
 The data elements of the usage view applicable in our scenario are business entity, building, property, 
pooled space, rental space, and rental unit. The same is depicted in Figure  2-3 . 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MASTER DATA OBJECTS

 The master data in SAP REFX is defined in a hierarchical manner. Each object at the lower level is linked 
to a corresponding object at a higher level. The hierarchy is maintained as shown in Figure  2-4 . 
 The differences between the architecture view and the usage view are shown in Figure  2-5 . 
 Figure 2-4.  Master data hierarchy maintained in SAP REFX

CHAPTER 2 ■ MASTER DATA OBJECTS

 Business Partners and Their Roles 
 A business  partner in SAP REFX is a person or an organization with whom a business interest exists. Vital data 
such as name, addresses, bank details, and data related to persons, organizations, or groups is maintained as part 
of business partner data. Different real estate management processes require different business partner data. 
 The business partner can assume multiple business partner roles depending on the business process 
involved, such as lease-in, lease-out, or real estate services. You do not need to create the general data —
 which is independent of a business partner’s function or of application-specific extensions — again in each 
case for each business partner. This prevents data from being created and stored redundantly. Each business 
partner role also brings additional application-specific attributes to the business partner. In effect, a role is a 
certain view of the business partner that is dependent on the business context. 
 The functions of the business partner are defined in financial transactions via business partner roles, 
such as counterparty, issuer, payment bank, or depository bank. The rights and obligations of the business 
partner are defined at the time of assigning the role category. 
 In SAP REFX, all customers or vendors must be defined as a business partner (T-Code: BP) in order 
to generate FI postings. We can also create a business partner from existing customers or vendors by using 
T-Codes FLBPD1 and FLBPC1 respectively. Also, the linkage of an existing customer or vendor to a business 
partner can be done via T-Codes FLBPD2 and FLBPC2 respectively. We can also automate the creation of a 
customer or vendor when the business partner is created. 
 SAP Financial Accounting has accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) subledgers 
to manage accounting data for all customers and vendors, by using customer/vendor master records. 
Customer and vendor integration with the business partner is required for SAP REFX to use Financial 
Accounting (FI). For example, say you have business partner XYZ, who is also a customer. In SAP REFX, for 
XYZ the business partner number is 8781 and the customer master number is 2456. Now, in order to ensure 
the sanity of data and one single source of truth, the business partner and customer master records of XYZ 
need to be integrated so that any data change made in one master record is reflected in another.

CHAPTER 2 ■ MASTER DATA OBJECTS

 There are multiple business roles available in SAP REFX, but we will consider two main roles — those of 
vendor and customer — to support the lease-in and lease-out processes. Table  2-1 explains these two main 
business partner roles.  
 Let us try to understand business partners using our business scenario. Vistala Reality Limited has 
taken a plot of land on lease for 25 years from Puna Multinational Retail, to whom monthly rent is paid. 
Landlord with vendor account is the business partner role that is taking care of this business relationship. 
Vistala Reality Limited has let out different shops, such as stores, ATM, cafeteria, and multiplex, to different 
customers for monthly rent. They are all tenants of the mall owner, and thus their role is that of a master 
tenant with customer account. Figure  2-6 showcases these two main business partner roles.

 Landlord of an object (leased-in by the company code). 
The landlord is assigned to a contract. The rent to be 
paid is handled on the vendor account assigned to the 
landlord.

 Summary 
 In this chapter, we explained the two real estate views available in SAP REFX — architectural view and usage 
view — with a business case as an example. We also discussed various master data elements like business 
entity, land, building, and rental objects. These elements are used to create a real estate structure and to 
control and monitor real estate assets effectively. Lastly, we also explained the concept of business partners 
and two main roles that can be used for capturing vendor and customer transactions for lease-in and lease-
out processes.

 CHAPTER 3  
 Real Estate Contracts 
 This chapter will explain different types of  real estate contracts c arried out as well as contract management. 
In this chapter, we will discuss the following:
• 
 Lease-in contracts 
• 
 Lease-out contracts 
• 
 Terms and  security deposit agreements 
• 
 Critical dates with reason 
• 
 Condition amounts 
• 
 Steps in contract management 
 A real estate contract is a contract between two parties, the lessor and the lessee. The lessor is the legal 
owner of the asset who provides the lessee the right to use the asset for consideration, which is a rental 
payment. A formal document called an  agreement contains details like property, term, rental amount, 
and also detailed terms and conditions. SAP REFX has provisions to capture these details. It also updates 
accounting data once periodic postings are carried out. 
 Some of the key aspects related to contracts are mentioned next. 
 Lease-in Contracts 
 A  lease-in contract would be created in cases where we are renting land or building premises from a third 
party. Take the example of a gasoline company with large gasoline stations across country. Each station is 
constructed on land that is taken on lease from a local landlord. This is a lease-in contract for the gasoline 
company. In SAP REFX, this contract is supported by the general contract, which enables accounts payable 
postings to be made on the lease-in contract. 
 Lease-out Contracts 
 Lease-out contracts can be of residential or commercial properties. This is determined based on the usage 
type of the assigned rental unit. Lease-outs may be segregated according to company-specific criteria using 
freely defined contract types like garage agreements or residential or commercial agreements. 
 The gasoline company uses the land taken on lease for a gasoline station and lets out the balance of the 
area to different tenants for a fast food restaurant, bank ATM, tire shop, and so forth, which are all lease-out 
contracts. In SAP REFX, this contract type is supported by the general contract, which enables accounts 
receivable postings to be made on the lease-out contracts.  

CHAPTER 3 ■ REAL ESTATE CONTRACTS
16
 Terms and Security Deposit Agreements 
 All real estate contracts need terms information, such as the start and end dates of the contract, duration, 
termination notice rules, renewal option rules if applicable, and so on. In SAP REFX, rental objects 
are assigned to lease-out or lease-in contracts, and those that are not assigned to any contract type are 
considered as being vacant and available for rent. SAP REFX also provides information on contracts that are 
expiring and will serve notices until they are renewed. 
 The security deposit  contracts are those where the tenant pays a deposit, which is refundable after 
the end of the contractual duration. The security deposit can be due on various dates and be subject to 
adjustment when conditions are changed, like an increase in rent. Besides contractually fixed security 
deposits, the agreed upon security deposit can also be calculated based on the contract conditions. 
 Critical Dates with Reason 
 Critical dates are those dates that are important from a contractual and statutory perspective. SAP REFX 
contracts provide the functionality to capture critical dates of the contract, like start date, end date, and 
notice period, and can provide alerts to ensure timely action. The contract term stipulates start and end 
dates, which ensures that overlapping rental periods are not created for the rental object. You can specify 
critical dates on each contract, and the system will provide you with a periodic critical-dates report for your 
entire real estate (RE) portfolio. Automatic reminders can be set in the system to ensure no critical contract 
date goes unnoticed and that timely actions are initiated. You can manually enter critical dates, renewal 
option dates, and notices, and the system will automatically generate reminders based on these dates.  
 Condition Amounts 
 The  condition amounts are rents to be charged for use of property and are freely definable in an SAP REFX 
contract. This means that the basic rent, service charges, advance payments, flat rates, and surcharges can 
be structured as required and assigned time-dependently to the lease-outs. Condition amounts are derived 
from condition types and are mapped to a condition group and then assigned to a contract type. Let us take 
the example of “Basic rent,” which is created as condition type and mapped to condition group “Customer 
contract,” which in turn is assigned to contract type “customer contract-commercial.” 
 When the lease-out is created, the conditions in the rental unit are proposed and can be modified as 
required. You can also determine time-dependent rent reductions for each condition of a lease-out. This is 
also available for lease-in contracts. 
 Steps in Contract Management 
 Let us see how to create a commercial lease-out  contract for a department store that is let on monthly fixed 
charges. We have captured key tabs from the SAP REFX contract-creation process. 
 In order to post receivables to the customer account in case any space has been leased out to alliance 
partners, a commercial lease-out contract needs to be created in SAP REFX. 
 The creation of a contract in SAP REFX should only be done after the agreement has been signed 
between the organization and the alliance partner and all necessary approvals have been obtained by the 
respective role holders. 
 Before the contract can be created, necessary master data objects should have been created in the 
system, such as the business entity, pooled space, and rental space. The business partner entry also needs to 
be created for the customer with whom the alliance has been made.

in the drop-down. In cases of monthly frequency, you can choose the option “Start 
of condition,” in which case the frequency of payments will start from the date of the 
start of condition. 
 Prorated: In case the agreement starts from any date within the month — say, the 16th 
or so — and the agreement says to make the first payment for the first 14 days in the 
current month and then pay on a monthly basis, the Prorated option “Contract or 
Rental Object Start of End Date” needs to be chosen. 
Amt Reference: Choose the option from the drop-down entries as to whether the 
amount is paid monthly, yearly, or cyclical, as the case may be.
Calc. Method: Whether the calculation of the amount due is based on an exact 
number of days in a month or a fixed 30 days in a month. Choose the appropriate 
option as the case may be.
 Payment Form: Whether the payment is received at the beginning of the month for 
the month ahead or at the end of the month for the previous month. Choose the 
options “In Advance” or “In Arrears” respectively as the case may be.

 We use the  Conditions tab to indicate the type of rental amount agreed upon by the parties. 
It can be a fixed rate charged on a periodic basis, or that is to be calculated based on the 
measurements of the individual rental objects assigned to the contract. All rental charges 
are time specific. Based on the conditions specified, we can capture advanced payments or 
prepayments that are reconciled at a later date. You can use the Conditions tab to initiate a 
controlling or financial posting action. When you enter conditions in a contract, the system 
automatically creates a cash-flow projection of planned income or expenses, which is posted 
to the Financials module, and planned income or expense data is converted into open items. 
 We also have sales-based rent, where rentals are charged based on sales revenue or 
volume of sales. When a contract is sales based, the system captures all conditions, 
calculations, and relevant information for the sales-based rent settlement process. Take 
an example of a duty-free shop in an airport lounge, where airport authorities have rented 
out a space and rent is determined based on the volume of sales at the shop. SAP REFX 
provides functionality to capture detailed information on the types of eligible products, 
number of products sold, product schedule or grading, and any effective sales caps. 
Once you enter this information in the contract, the system tracks reported tenant sales, 
processes rent calculations at specified intervals, and posts open items in the financials. 
This process is supported by the SAP Interactive Forms software by Adobe. The tenant 
enters sales data using the SAP Interactive Forms software, which compiles sales reports 
and correspondence. The sales-based lease functionality can also be used for expense 
leases; for example, when a retailer leases a shop from a shopping mall operator.

 Summary 
 We have learned in this chapter how to create real estate contracts, with different business information being 
captured as part of a standard SAP REFX contract. An SAP REFX contract is a prerequisite to having the 
accounting and posting of transactions in the Financials module, and thus contracts need to be understood 
clearly.

 CHAPTER 4  
 Accounting 
 In this chapter we will talk about how to configure  accounting in an REFX implementation. In this chapter, 
we will discuss the following:
• 
 Periodic posting of lease-out contracts 
• 
 Reversal of periodic posting of contracts 
• 
 Verification of posting document after periodic posting 
• 
 Vacancy for  rental objects 
• 
 Account  determination 
• 
 One-time posting 
• 
 Accrual/deferral postings 
 We saw in an earlier chapter that real estate contracts are formed between two parties, where the lessor 
is the legal owner of the asset and provides the lessee the right to use the asset for consideration, which is a 
rental payment. The contract is an agreement entered into by both parties and covers details like property, 
term, rental amount, terms, and conditions. The SAP REFX module provides various tabs in which to 
capture these details at the time of contract creation. It also updates accounting data once periodic postings 
are carried out. 
 The  periodic processing program generates payments and receivables based on the conditions assigned 
to the SAP real estate contract. The program also automatically creates follow-up postings based on changes 
made to conditions for back-dated changes. These postings are automatically recorded in the general 
ledger and within the controlling module. The periodic processing program is run for any contract type and 
within both simulation and update modes. Reversal of entries may also be generated through the periodic 
processing reversal program. Entries created using the periodic processing program must be reversed using 
the periodic processing reversal program. However, it is not necessary to reverse periodic postings when 
changes are made to a condition after the periodic posting run, since any changes made to the condition will 
be recorded during the next periodic posting run. Besides generating financial postings for accounts payable 
and receivable, it also distributes contract costs among the real estate objects assigned to the contract. 
 Let us take for an example a company that leased commercial spaces to tenants and invoices them 
on a yearly basis using Flexible Real Estate Management (REFX), where the real estate contract contains 
payment terms and conditions. The company is required to invoice the customers on due dates by posting 
the Financials (FI) document periodically, updating both the customer account and the revenue 
General Ledger (GL) account. 
 There is seamless integration between REFX and the accounting modules (Finance and Controlling), 
and these postings are automated. 
 SAP REFX’s lease accounting is fully integrated into SAP Financials and SAP  Controlling  .

CHAPTER 4 ■ ACCOUNTING

• 
 Period postings of all payable, receivable, and GL transactions are based on the cash 
flow of the real estate contract conditions. 
• 
 Open items are managed through accounts payable and accounts receivable  
• 
 One-time posting transactions may be generated through the real estate module.  
• 
 Periodic postings of all vacant rental objects, where the vacancy cost centers are 
billed 
 Real estate invoices are created and printed from within the REFX module based on postings made 
to the vendor account. The periodic postings will identify all plan items within the defined due date and 
generate a debit and a credit posting for each one of the plan items. There is also a CO posting against 
the real estate contract (for a payable lease, this is a cost posting, whereas the receivable lease will have a 
revenue cost element). The transfer posting then allows these costs/revenues on the lease to be distributed 
to the RE objects or other CO objects. The vacancy posting creates either lost revenue or vacancy cost 
postings against the identified cost center. The periodic posting run can first be simulated to enable review 
and modifications, if required. All changes should be made in the contract to generate the right cash-flow 
adjustment, resulting in the proper postings. 
 One-time posting transactions allow for a pre-configuration of RE-specific posting transactions (based 
on transaction FB50) and can be posted to accounts payable, receivable, a GL account, or a combination of 
these. 
 Let us see how periodic posting for lease-out contracts is carried out. 
 Periodic Posting for Lease-out Contracts 
 You use the  periodic posting run (creation of debits on customers) to generate open items in a customer 
account, which can be cleared by receipt of money from customer against these debits. 
 Trigger 
 Perform this procedure when periodic posting is due. In a real estate contract for lease-out, it will be 
specified whether it is a monthly, quarterly, or yearly contract. The periodic posting run has to be carried out 
as per that criteria.

 Regarding due-date  determination in the periodic posting process: 
 Due dates for a condition are specified by the frequency term, such as in advance, mid-
month, or in arrears. For more complex payment requirements, a correction rule is defined 
for determining the due date. The correction rule is also assigned to the frequency term. An 
organization may have a business process in place to make rent payments 7 days in advance 
of the next month’s rental payment. Additionally, the rent expense should be recorded in the 
same month in which the check was issued, not the month for which the payment was due. The 
periodic processing program selects rent payments based on their due dates and posts those 
rents to the period specified within the posting program. For example, if a company processes 
July's rent payments on 06/23, then on 06/24 the periodic processing program is executed 
for period 9 with a due date of <= 06/30 and a posting date of 06/24, in period 8. A seven-day 
correction rule will be configured with the name and will by default applied to the contract.

 Result

 Vacancy for Rental  Objects 
 We can post notional costs (or revenue) resulting from the conditions of the rental objects to vacancy cost 
centers. We use this function to analyze vacancy costs. Let us take an example of a rental object that is let out 
for part of the year and vacant for the remaining period. This needs to be analyzed as to what is the notional 
cost of failure to rent out property or building on said rental. 
 Periodic postings are made for a company code or codes. You can simulate and reverse posting runs as 
previously discussed. Posting and error logs display current information about the posting status. If you define 
conditions on the rental object, and the rental object is vacant, the system updates the cash flow based on the 
conditions  defined for the case of vacancy (vacancy cash flow). With every subsequent periodic posting for 
the vacancy, the system generates a cash flow and posts the receivables according to the conditions defined. 
 Retroactive  changes (such as the subsequent activation of a contract) could result in follow-up postings. 
If the notional cost is to be posted to a cost center in your organization, you have to assign the cost center 
to the rental object (in the Posting Data tab). The posting can also be made across company codes; in other 
words, the posting is made to a cost center belonging to another company code in the same controlling area. 
If the rental object is not assigned to a cost center, you post the expense to the rental object itself. 
 Let us take the example of a department store situated in building 1 of a mall that has been  vacant   since 
01/01/2016. As per the market rate, the store can be leased out for monthly rent of EUR 16,000. We can carry 
out the posting to arrive at a vacancy cost resulting from the non-letting of the store. This cost is attributable 
to the non-occupancy of the premises and the notional loss thereby incurred. Follow the steps mentioned 
next to carry out a vacancy posting for this example.

 Account  Determination 
 All the master data in REFX (for example, business entity, building, and rental objects) falls under a 
company code, which is created in FI. Automatic account determination is the process whereby the system 
finds the relevant GL accounts to be posted to. The system debits the customer account specified in the 
real estate contract and credits the income account in the case of lease-out contracts. These settings are 
mandatory, and without them you cannot execute the periodic postings for real estate contracts. 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ ACCOUNTING
52
 In REFX, the accounting  flow type depends on the condition type. We need to assign the condition type 
to a flow type, which you then link to reference flow types for three different  scenarios :
• 
 Condition amount is increased retroactively 
• 
 Condition amount is reduced retroactively 
• 
 Object transfer postings 
 You then assign the flow type and reference flow types to account symbols that in turn are assigned to the 
GL. The conditions on the real estate contract create cash flow items, which are marked as plan items with a 
due date. These plan items display the account determination (based on the flow types that are assigned to 
the condition types), payment terms and parameters, posting parameters, as well as distribution rules. 
 Account Symbols 
 Account symbols represent GL accounts, with one account symbol being created for each GL account used. 
Account symbols are used instead of the actual GL account, because country-specific GL accounts can be 
assigned to just one account symbol. Examples of account  symbols are shown in Figure  4-24 . 
 Figure 4-24.  Account  symbols 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ ACCOUNTING
53
 Account Symbols to  Flow Types 
 The final step in configuring the account determination is the assignment of account symbols to flow types 
(Figures  4-25 and  4-26 ). This ensures the correct GL assignment for each condition based on the posting 
requirements.

 Accrual/Deferral Postings 
 An  accrual of an expense refers to the reporting of an expense and the related liability in the period in which 
it occurs, and that period is prior to the period in which the payment is made. An example of an accrual for 
an expense is when the electricity consumed in December, but the payment will not be made until January. 
 A deferral of an expense refers to a payment that was made in one period, but will be reported as an 
expense in a later period. An example is the payment in December for the six-month insurance premium 
that will be reported as an expense in the months of January through June. 
 An accrual of revenues refers to the reporting of revenues and the related receivables in the period in 
which they are earned, and that period is prior to the period of the cash receipt. An example of the accrual 
of revenues is the interest earned in December on an investment in fixed deposit, but the interest will not be 
received until January. 
 The system can calculate accruals and deferrals to the day or month. The system differentiates between 
accruals and deferrals, and Accrual Engine is used for posting accruals and deferrals in REFX. Standard 
settings make it so that data is transferred from REFX to Accrual Engine, and at the same time accrual 
postings are made. 
 Settings for Accrual/Deferrals 
 Copy the settings for the REFX application component that are provided by SAP in the standard system, 
and then modify your enterprise structure (company codes, accounting principles, and so on) as required.

 Here we entered the document type for each accrual type and need to enter the account for each given 
accrual type. 
 Conditions in Foreign Currency 
 So far we have seen conditions in local currency; however, let’s see the activation of conditions in a  foreign 
currency . 
 Activate Conditions in Foreign Currency in Company Code 
 The first step is to define the default currency for each company code. If the company is to allow a condition 
currency that is different from the company code currency, then the “Diff Condition Currency” option must 
be selected. 
 Define Translation Date Shift Rule 
 The  translation date shift rule defines how the system determines a date on the basis of a starting date that 
was entered. You have to define translation date shift rules if the following applies: You use conditions in 
a foreign currency, and you do not want the system to determine a fixed date for the currency translation. 
Instead, the date entered should only serve as a starting date for determining the translation date.  
 FASB 13 
 FASB 13 specifies that irregular rent payments and lease incentives be recorded on a straight-line basis. 
Based on US GAAP, the company needs to record the following entries into the general ledger: 
 Straight-Line Requirements 
 SAP has provided a FAS13 sample BAdI. This BAdI may be implemented in order to automate the straight-
lining of entries associated with irregular rent payments and lease incentives. At the time of Go live , FAS13 
functional specification document containing  detailed requirements and developments may be prepared.
Existing leases may be excluded from the FAS13 calculation, because the values being amortized may not 
match the system-calculated values due to the timing of the conditions and recognition of all one-time 
payments that are FAS13 relevant. In order to exclude leases from this calculation, a custom table with 
company code, contract number, and an exclusion indicator can  be created listing all existing leases at the 
time of “go-live.” 
 TI Allowance and  TI Reimbursement 
 Tenant improvement (TI) allowances are incentives provided by landlords with which tenants can modify 
a space to meet their requirements. FASB requires the incentive be offset against rent over the course of the 
lease term. Additionally, because the lease term is generally longer than one year, the long-term portion of 
the TI allowance must be reclassified into the long-term accrual account. Each month, the current portion of 
the long-term accrual should be reclassified to the short-term accrual account, as the accrual is amortized. 
Because a TI allowance requires that a receivable be set up on a lease-in (vendor) contract, a special GL 
indicator will need to be configured to appropriately classify the receivable and prohibit the receivable from 
being offset against rent expenses. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ ACCOUNTING

 Key Aspects 
 Key aspects to be considered in RE accounting are as follows:
• 
 When SAP Real Estate is activated, real estate – specific fields are made available for 
use within the various finance modules. To use these fields, the field status group 
should be changed to allow an “Optional” entry. The real estate cost object may then 
be used just like any other SAP cost object. 
• 
 Generally, vendor master records will be created by the accounts payable 
department, and the corresponding landlord with vendor account is created 
automatically. This automation should only create business partners with the role 
“Landlord w/ Vendor Account” if the vendor is specifically for real estate. However, 
all invoices related to real estate should be posted directly to a real estate object. 
The real estate object will eventually settle the expenses with the real estate cost 
center. It is critical that all costs are posted to the real estate object to enable full cost 
allocation to all tenants. 
• 
 With the activation of real estate accounting, the real estate cost objects become 
available for use within FI postings, but the field status for group “Real Estate 
Management” must be marked as an optional entry. The following field status 
groups should be modified to allow postings to real estate object.  
• 
 You can post conditions for   withholding tax   using RE posting processes. You can 
use this function, for example, in the United States to deal with sales tax on lease 
payments. When a contract is created, the tax indicator is assigned to the posting 
parameter. During periodic processing, the tax payment is reduced from or added to 
the payment amount based on the tax configuration. The tax amount is paid directly 
to the appropriate tax authorities. 
• 
  A consistent issue most organizations encounter is the lack of ability to link fixed 
assets to a building or property. To alleviate this issue, the real estate key (IM Key) 
will be displayed on the asset master record for assignment to a real estate object. 
Additionally, users may assign fixed assets to a building or property object through 
the architectural view. 
• 
  The “Define Screen Layout for Asset Master Data” asset classes must be identified 
who must have the real estate indicator.  
• 
  In order to receive depreciation postings to a real estate object, the account 
assignment object’s IM Key must be activated for both expense and balance sheet 
postings. The account assignment is then assigned to each company code and 
depreciation area that has real estate assets. 
 Service Tax 
 In India, companies  leasing  buildings or properties for commercial purposes are required to pay service 
tax to the corresponding federal tax office. Real estate contracts are considered to be contracts for services 
and not for goods, and therefore, from a business point of view, in India no value-added tax (VAT) needs to 
be maintained in the contracts, only service tax. From a technical point of view, the service tax is handled 
like VAT. It is levied on the services rendered and is applied on the total price of the service. For lease-out 
contracts, it is a deferred tax that is levied at the time of the incoming payment. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ ACCOUNTING
64
 In cases of commercial contracts, the owner of the real estate object reports and pays the service tax to 
the corresponding tax authorities. The geographical location of the real estate object determines which local 
tax authority the service tax should be reported to. The owner of the real estate object enters the tax office 
information in the real estate object master data. Residential contracts are not subject to service tax. 
 The business place represents the organizational unit responsible for collecting service tax. You 
maintain business places in the following master data of Flexible Real Estate Management (REFX):
• 
 Business entities (Sites) 
• 
 Buildings 
• 
 Properties (Land) 
 You fill in the required customization settings. You might maintain business entities, buildings, 
properties, and rental objects. You assign the objects to your commercial contract and create conditions 
for your contract with tax types and tax groups that correspond to the service tax. Each month, you make a 
periodic posting of your commercial contract. Whenever the tenant pays the rent for the real estate object, 
you post the incoming (partial) payments with the Incoming Payments program and account for the service 
tax in the GL tax accounts, and then you make a payment to the tax authorities.  
 Summary 
 We have seen how accounting is managed in SAP REFX, including different types of postings, how to do 
a reversal, and how REFX updates accounting data in RE object. Periodic postings create accounting, 
controlling, and RE documents that are updated within real estate contracts. We have also discussed some of 
the key aspects of real estate contracts from an accounting perspective.

 CHAPTER 5  
 Business Integration 
 This chapter will explain how SAP REFX integrates with the SAP Asset Accounting (AA), SAP Plant and 
Maintenance (PM), SAP Project Systems (PS), SAP Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and SAP 
Document Management Systems (DMS) modules. The chapter is divided into the following topics:
• 
 Integration with Asset Accounting 
• 
 Integration with PM, PS, and CRM 
• 
 Integration with DMS 
• 
 Integration of CAD and GIS  
 The SAP Flexible Real Estate Management solution is used by organizations in various sectors, such as 
retail, technology, banking, heavy industry, airports, oil and energy, utility energy, and many others. All of 
these industries have multiple production sites, gasoline stations, warehouses, and ports located in owned 
or rented property. SAP REFX helps these companies to manage the real estate assets, such as for property 
maintenance, and to assess the profitability of individual branches and outlets. SAP  REFX has strong 
integration capabilities and can be used by organizations with an SAP backend and also by companies 
operating other ERP systems. It naturally integrates with other SAP modules, industry solutions, and SAP 
business objects. It is capable of integrating with third-party solutions and enables operational efficiency 
and attainment of business objectives for different sectors using the solution. 
 REFX provides seamless integration with other SAP modules that cover things like Fixed Assets, Finance 
and Controlling, Sales and Distribution, Project Management, Investment Management, Plant Maintenance, 
and HR. The ability to integrate with the Microsoft Office software package helps the solution’s users to 
communicate with vendors, customers, and business partners who are associated with a property. In such a 
case, it is possible to use SAP REFX for lease agreements, to send invoices to tenants, and to order additional 
maintenance work. You can generate dynamic reports, which can then be uploaded to Excel. 
 Integration with Asset Accounting 
 The Asset  Accounting (FI-AA) module is used for managing fixed assets and providing detailed information 
on transactions regarding fixed assets. The R/3 Asset Accounting module transfers data directly to and from 
other SAP modules via its integration capabilities. When you purchase an asset, you can post an entry from 
the  Materials Management (MM) module directly to FI-AA, or when it is constructed in house, all the costs—
like material, labor, and services—can be posted to a “Work in progress” account within the  work breakdown 
structure (WBS),  which can then be settled to an asset account. 
 The link between real estate objects and an asset is established by entering details of the real estate 
objects in the asset master under the time-dependent tab, and it is used as an account assignment object. 
Correspondingly, we need to assign the relevant asset number in the Assignment tab of the Rental Objects 
screen. A real estate object can be used as a depreciation account assignment after following certain steps. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ BUSINESS INTEGRATION
66
We need to release the real estate object from the RE master data dialog for account assignment and then 
manually maintain the real estate account assignment in the Time-dependent tab of the asset master 
record. The use of the real estate object as an account assignment for depreciation is only possible if the 
corresponding settings are made in the Customization screen of the Asset Accounting module. 
 Customization in Asset Accounting 
 The following are the activities to be carried out for the integration of Asset Accounting with REFX. 
 Master Data Screen Layout 
 We have to change the configuration settings for Asset Accounting in the Master Data screen, defining a 
screen layout rule. In the screen layout rule, under time-dependant data section, we have to select the “field 
group rule” option for a real estate object. 
 Integration with  GL 
 Now, we have to define the field status variant and select “Real Estate Management” under that. 
 Additional Account  Assignment Objects 
 In this step we will handle settings for additional account assignment objects—settings like cost center, 
investment order, and real estate object. We need to activate additional account assignment objects (IMKEY) 
so that transactions can be posted to the general ledger. Real estate objects like business entity, land, 
building, and rental object can be set as account assignment objects. 
 The standard reports are available in REFX for object assignments in Buildings/Rental Objects (ROs), 
and depreciation values can be checked in asset reports. 
 Let us take, for example, a building structure at a mall that is partially used for internal purposes by 
a company while the remaining space is let out to different tenants, such as shops, bank, commercial 
establishments. etc. In SAP FI-AA, you capitalize the building as one structure, and depreciation and 
maintenance costs are captured for the building as a whole. This is as per statutory and accounting 
requirements of the respective country. You do not capitalize each unit of the building separately in Asset 
Accounting, as shown in the following screenshots (Figure  5-1 ). The asset master record for the building 
is created in FI-AA, and under the Time-dependent tab you can see that the real estate object is assigned 
(Figure  5-2 ). 
 Figure 5-1.  Asset master record’s  Initial screen 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ BUSINESS INTEGRATION
67
 However, all of the sub-units in the one building are captured as separate real estate objects by SAP 
REFX. You need to enter these objects in the asset’s master screen in FI-AA and enter the asset number 
generated in FI-AA in the Assignments tab of the rental object (Figure  5-3  and Figure  5-4 ). You may also 
enter the business entity in the asset’s master record. 
 Figure 5-2.  Asset master record:  Time-dependent tab 
 Figure 5-3.  Rental object : Initial screen 
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ BUSINESS INTEGRATION
68
 Integration with PM 
 SAP PM module provides a comprehensive solution for all maintenance activities performed within the 
organization. Let us take an example of an airport building. Various real estate objects that are part of the 
building need maintenance. You may have a plant in the same structure, and it may be necessary to ensure 
regular and preventive maintenance tasks. Some examples of maintenance are cleaning of premises, 
repairing various systems, preventative maintenance of elevators and air conditioning systems, and many 
other such services. Airport authorities can use the Plant Maintenance  module      to manage their real estate 
objects. We can use the Customer Services module for real estate objects used by tenants, customers, or 
other companies within group. The master data objects of both components are same. 
 Functional locations in the PM and CS components describe the fixed, unchangeable parts of real 
estate, such as maintenance groups or rooms. Integration with the SAP REFX component happens by 
assigning functional locations of the PM and CS components to the real estate objects in the usage or 
architectural views. 
 The architectural view controls the PM integration with REFX. Functional locations can be 
maintained at the plant, building, and site levels. Functional locations can be assigned to real estate 
master data either manually or automatically. The user can create notifications or work orders from 
the architectural hierarchy for these functional locations, and all notifications and orders that have 
been linked to a building, property, or site will be displayed through the architectural hierarchy. In 
this configuration step, the architectural object is defined for those transactions for which object will 
be used to create notifications and work orders. Notifications may be created at the site, building, and 
property levels. 
 You may use functionality for the automatic creation of functional locations from the architectural 
hierarchy. However, there has to be a business requirement to drive functional locations to lower levels, such 
as part of building or room. 
 Figure 5-4.  Rental object : Assignments  tab 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ BUSINESS INTEGRATION
69
 Integration with PS  
 SAP PS is an integrated project management tool used for planning, managing, and controlling projects; it 
supports the entire project lifecycle from planning to invoicing. Project System is used for new project and 
development work like construction projects that have a certain time cycle for completion. Let us take the 
previous example of an airport where we have to construct a runway with other facilities around it. You may 
have to start with design, drawing, consultancy expenses, and so on. You have to procure materials and 
incur labor costs, and after completion of construction, you must transfer all costs to create and capitalize 
assets. You need to capture these costs until completion in a separate account assignment object—or  work 
breakdown structure (WBS) —and settle it with the asset master data created in FI-AA, where the cost value 
is posted and then linked with a real estate object. 
 You can assign a complete project (project definition with several WBS elements) or parts of a project 
(one or more WBS elements). In the application, you maintain the assignment in the Assignments tab of the 
relevant data object. However, you must have already enabled the assignment in Customizing before you 
can do this. 
 The  PS component does not have an attribute that you can use to maintain the assignment. You may 
use other ways, like configuring the project number in such a way that part of the number contains the 
relevant information to represent the assignment. 
 Integration with CRM 
 The integration point between  CRM and REFX is the real estate master data. SAP CRM integration is 
available to cater the service/complaint management needs of SAP REFX. We can define the product 
or service that is the subject of the complaint by entering a reference object for an item. You can enter a 
reference to products, installed base components, or objects (e.g., rental objects, buildings, land, business 
entities). Let us take the same example of an airport where space is allotted to a customer for duty-free 
shops, cafeteria, and so on. Any complaint about maintenance or other issues related to space allotted or 
a specific service request is sent with a reference to the rental object that is the property created in REFX. 
Besides this, we can also automatically create functional locations upon REFX object creation, which can 
be updated as an installed base in SAP CRM. We can use this functionality of SAP CRM while having objects 
linked to the SAP REFX object. 
 SAP provides a business role called Real Estate Professional (/CRMRE/PRO) that provides a user 
interface that enables you to manage campaigns, leads, and opportunities for your real estate. 
 SAP also provides a business adapter object called Real Estate Rental Object (/CRMRE/ROBJ) and 
a customizing adapter object called Rental Object Customizing Table (/CRMRE/CUST_RO) to enable 
replication of data for real estate objects like entity, RO, land, and building from SAP ECC. These real estate 
objects exist in SAP CRM as objects, but replication of the real estate objects is one-way only, and we cannot 
do it reverse. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ BUSINESS INTEGRATION
70
 Campaign Management for Real Estate 
 We can create campaign types using the Real Estate Campaign (CCM_RCPG) UI scenario. When we create a 
campaign using one of these campaign types, a new assignment block of rental objects is made available. In 
this assignment block, you can enter the rental objects that you want to market. Let us take the example of 
the airport where we have vacant places to be given for commercial purposes; we can create a campaign for 
letting them out and can also perform availability checks for the same places.  
 Lead Management for Real Estate 
 A new transaction type called Real Estate Lead (LDRE) provided by SAP helps in  lead management   for real 
estate. When we create a lead using this transaction type, a new assignment block of rental objects and a new 
date type of “Expected Contract Period” are made available. We can enter the rental objects that are available 
for lease-out in the rental objects assignment block. The expected contract period date type enables system 
checks to verify the occupancy of a rental object during the specified period. 
 Opportunity Management for Real Estate 
 A new transaction type called Real Estate Opportunity (OPRE) helps in opportunity management for real 
estate. When you create an opportunity using this transaction type, a new assignment block of rental objects 
and a new date type of “Expected Contract Period” are made available. We can enter the rental objects that 
we want to rent in the rental objects assignment block. The expected contract period date type enables 
system checks to verify the occupancy of a rental object during the specified period.   
 Integration with DMS 
 Document Management  System in SAP REFX enables you to store the documents involved in the rental 
management process (such as agreements, legal documents, land records, tenant ID proofs, any legal 
documents, master data summaries, letters, contract forms, presentations, structural drawings, or photos 
of buildings/properties, etc.) The SAP REFX system is data intensive and is used for maintaining complex 
land records. Let us take for an example an oil and gas company that has a refinery as its production unit 
and retail outlets spread across regions distributing gas to vehicle owners. These retail outlets, or gas 
pumps, are constructed on either purchased land or leased land. Each piece of land has different records, 
agreements, designs, and so forth that need to be referred to for lease payment or at the time of legal 
disputes. DMS is used by organizations to maintain complete data against real estate objects—which is 
land in this case. It improves business value greatly, as companies do not have complete visibility as to 
area of land or lease terms disputes, if any, and integration of real estate with DMS helps to address these 
painful areas. We can select the DMS of our choice; SAP DMS is also available along with third-party 
DMS. We can also manage the SAP REFX workflow through DMS. SAP DMS, when used with REFX, will 
require the creation of a dedicated document type, which then will be used for uploading the soft copies 
of documents(s). 
 We can follow this path for configuring DMS for SAP REFX:  
 SPRO ➤ Flexible Real Estate Management (REFX) ➤ General Settings for Master Data and 
Contract ➤ Document Management ➤ Document Management System. 
 There is also an integration process for SAP REFX and DMS; SAP note 860779 is available 
to explain that. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ BUSINESS INTEGRATION
71
 Integration with CAD/ GIS 
 Organizations have been striving to optimize their processes and improve efficiency by using SAP. GIS 
is used for location-based information management, and SAP is used for other business requirements 
at an overarching level. Both systems have strong points, and integrating both adds tremendous value 
to a business. However, in spite of many attempts, no direct integration has been accomplished due to 
the complexity involved in handling both systems. Integration of both is a win-win situation, as SAP can 
leverage the spatial analysis capabilities of GIS and GIS can use the integrated business functionalities of 
SAP. Most business data have a geographic or spatial component that can be geo-referenced on a GIS map to 
visualize, understand, and interpret data, which is not possible through a spreadsheet or table. By visualizing 
relationships, connections, and patterns in business data, GIS helps in making appropriate decisions 
and increasing efficiency. The strength of SAP is its responsiveness to market changes and customer 
requirements, which could be further enhanced with the integration of GIS applications into business 
workflows. Development in digital technology and service-oriented architecture concepts made it possible 
to embed GIS applications with different systems such as SCADA and SAP. 
 Let us take, for example, the utility and energy sector, where geographical mapping is a key element 
for having an efficient decision-making processes for site selection, routing, resource allocation, planning, 
and asset management. GIS gives businesses the geographic advantage to become more responsive to 
daily business needs, such as land management, site selection, facility maintenance, emergency response, 
construction activities, fleet management and tracking, equipment mobilization, pipelines routing, and 
many others. 
 Integrating SAP REFX with CAD/GIS systems enables a visual interface for the architectural view. Master 
data of a land register or business entity or building can be attached real estate object to view the (CAD) design 
or (GIS) map of the property. We can make this assignment from either the usage view or the architectural 
view. However, the system always copies the measurements from the architectural object to the usage object. 
 The unique ability of GIS to model complex spatial relationships is challenging in hierarchical SAP 
structures, such as networks. GIS is also well suited to creating accurate SAP master data for attributes such 
as distance or area for use in such activities. We need to check that for every SAP business object where a 
graphic representation is desired, there is a corresponding feature in the GIS database. For example, a gas 
company may wish to capture information about a gas connection provided with a building. Similarly, 
details of water and electric connections can be located within a specific building, which is made possible 
by functionality available in GIS. The linking of GIS features to SAP business objects is achieved through 
foreign-key mapping, which can attach the unique ID for each SAP business object with a corresponding 
GIS feature.  
 SAP REFX and GIS are integrated and used in some of the airports where the entire land and real estate 
space is mapped in GIS to create a visual interface and be integrated with real estate objects. This helps to 
keep close control over property and also to ensure effective utilization of the property. 
 Port trust authorities are also using these interfaces to control port trust land, which is large in size and 
scattered; ensuring a close watch on such land is a challenge. These interfaces are further integrated with 
DMS, where all the land records, drawings, designs, and agreements are stored along with RE objects, and 
one can quickly get complete information about  it . 
 Summary 
 SAP Flexible Real Estate Management provides seamless integration capabilities to connect with other 
SAP modules—and non-SAP systems also—giving customers the best use of its functionality. SAP REFX 
combined with GIS/CAD is big value add for many organizations with large real estate assets. They are able 
to control assets effectively and ensure complete control of them.

 CHAPTER 6  
 Service Charge Settlements 
 In this chapter we will explain the service charge settlement  process and factors   influencing it, as well as 
describe the posting procedures. In this chapter, we will discuss the following:
• 
 Infrastructure of service charge settlements  
• 
 Pre-requisites to configuring a service charge settlement 
• 
 Configurations for service charge settlements in REFX 
• 
 Define RE-specific account properties 
 Let us understand this using a  business scenario . 
 Let us take an example of a mall where shops are let out on a rental basis to various units, like a fast 
food restaurant, fashion stores, other retail shops, bank ATMS, offices, and so on, and common facilities 
are provided and paid for by the lessor. Costs incurred for the maintenance of such facilities are paid by the 
landlord for the mall as a whole and need to be recovered from all tenants based on usage. This requires a 
system that will allocate costs among various tenants every month based on agreed upon parameters and 
debit them for settlement. SAP Flexible Real Estate Management provides fully automated, accurate, and 
transparent processes to ensure efficient service charge settlement processing. SAP REFX can help manage 
services, maintenance, and repairs for a particular organization’s properties and also for the organization’s 
customers’ properties. In SAP all the service charges are generally settled through settlement units, which 
have to be defined for each service charge that needs to be settled. A new settlement unit has to be created for 
each type of service charge that is defined in the service charge key and that participates in the settlement. 
 Another example is an airport where retail space has been let out to various units like duty-free shops, 
bank ATMs, restaurants, and spas, and where space is also used for the internal operations of airport, like 
offices, cargo handling unit’s break rooms, and so forth. The airport makes a total water and electricity bill 
payment for the complete property, and that needs to be recovered from each occupant based on usage. 
Water and electricity meters will provide usage details, and a service charge will be allocated among 
the tenants and internal units based on usage. The amount needs to be debited to the tenant and to the 
respective cost center of the internal unit. Apportionment of service charges needs to be clearly defined, as 
all costs are not apportionable in simple ways, such as we do for water or power where you have meters to 
capture consumption. Certain costs are not apportionable and need to have a logical, transparent basis for 
allocation. Elevator charges paid by the airport authority may not be possible to apportion between tenants 
who are using it—what is the basis for charging for it? 
 Service charge keys are created for the types of expenses that occur in real estate properties. Some of them 
are apportionable and some are not. For example, property taxes and water supply costs are allocated to tenants 
based on actual meters, but how do we allocate costs for the maintenance of elevators? We cannot keep track of 
the usage of each tenant. We need to use some rational basis for allocation. The next step will be to apportion 
the service charges among tenants who are liable to pay for the usage of such services. In REFX, you apportion 
service charges based on the measurements defined in the rental objects. It can be done in a few ways. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SERVICE CHARGE SETTLEMENTS
74
 Various  parameters based on which apportionment expenses can be made are:
• 
 Apportionment according to fixed values where a fixed amount that will be charged 
to each tenant is agreed upon by the parties 
• 
 Apportionment according to consumption values wherein you capture the number 
of units consumed by each tenant for electricity usage and charge based on the total 
units for which the landlord made a bill payment  
• 
 Apportionment according to condition types  
• 
 Apportionment according to percentage shares where you agree to share a specific 
percentage of costs between various units 
• 
 Equal apportionment where an equal amount is allocated to each tenant  
• 
 Apportionment for vacant rental objects where a rental object—say, a shop—is 
vacant but you need to pay basis electricity charges and other charges and you need 
to allocate it to a respective unit/cost center 
 Once costs are apportioned, a service charge settlement is carried out through contracts and invoices. 
The tenants and service providers are entered into the system as business partners. The contracts are raised 
with the business partners and are managed by the contract management system in REFX; the invoices are 
raised and posted, as REFX is integrated with SAP Finance and Controlling (FICO). 
 Infrastructure of Service Charge Settlements 
 We need to create the following master data in order to carry out a service charge settlement. 
 Participation Group 
 Transaction Code 
 RESCPG 
 The  participation group (Figure  6-1 ) is made up of tenants who are required to share common expenses 
incurred for all. Rental objects are part of this group that participates in the settlement of one or more 
cost elements. Example: water charges paid by the mall owner need to be recovered from all the shops 
that are leased out for rent. We have to define the participation group containing these shops, which are 
created as rental objects in the system. Business entities, buildings, land, and rental objects can be part of a 
participation group. If a business entity containing rental objects is assigned, rental objects assigned to it are 
also automatically assigned to the participation group. The participation group indicates whether the rental 
object participates in the settlement. All rental objects assigned to a participation group participate in the 
apportionment of costs, provided that this participation group is assigned to a settlement unit. For example, 
if a building is assigned to the participation group, all of the rental objects belonging to that building are 
automatically assigned. We can exclude individual rental objects from a participation group, and also assign 
individual pooled spaces without including corresponding rental spaces. The apportionment of expenses 
between the rental objects of a participation group may be done for a defined period. Hence, while creating 
a participation group, we need to mention its validity period (Figure  6-2 ). Any expense beyond the validity 
period will not be allocated to the rental objects within the participation group.

CHAPTER 6 ■ SERVICE CHARGE SETTLEMENTS
76
 Assign the Objects on the  Assigned Objects Tab 
 Objects form a part of a participation group, and if you assign an object above the level of the rental object 
(such as building, pooled space, or another participation group) to a participation group, all lower-level 
objects within that object are automatically assigned as well. You can also exclude lower-level objects from 
the assignment. For example, say you assigned a building but want to assign one or more rental units from 
that building to another participation group. To do this, you insert the rental unit in the assignment table 
and select the Exclude indicator. If you assign a pooled space, all lower-level rental spaces are automatically 
assigned as well. If you only want to assign the vacant area of the pool, set the PS Only indicator. 
 Participation group “shops on second floor of mall” is created wherein two shops are selected to share 
service charge costs (Figure  6-3 ). 
 Figure 6-3.  Participation Group Display: Assigned  Objects 
 Two rental objects representing two shops of a department store are selected and assigned. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SERVICE CHARGE SETTLEMENTS
77
 Settlement Unit 
 Transaction  Code 
 RESCSU 
 We have to create a  settlement unit (SU) before we settle service charges. The settlement unit defines 
the following:
• 
 The settlement period during which settlement is possible, defined in settlement 
variants found in Customizing 
• 
 The type of service charges, such as water or electricity, by means of service charge 
keys 
• 
 Nature and purpose of the service charge apportionment, such as landlord/tenant 
apportionment or apportionment to tenants with any remainder assigned to 
landlord 
• 
 The measurement, such as electricity consumption in units or water consumption in 
cubic feet, using units of measurement defined in Customizing 
• 
 Rental objects like business entities, buildings, properties, and rental objects that are 
part of participation groups 
 We have to create a new settlement unit (Figure  6-4 ) for each type of service charge mentioned in the 
service charge key participating in the settlement. Cost collectors are defined for each settlement period to 
enable costs to be posted to a settlement unit. The costs of a settlement unit are collected on a cost collector 
for settlement for each settlement period. When we post to a settlement unit, the system determines the cost 
collector based on the specified settlement reference date (Figure  6-5 ).

 Click on the  Apportionment Rule  tab to assign a settlement variant (Figure  6-7 ). 
 Settlement Participation  
 Service charge settlement participation is automatically generated for each real estate contract each time 
the RE contract is called up, as well as on the date of settlement. In so doing, the system assigns the service 
charge keys of the settlement units to which the rental object(s) is/are assigned to the conditions of the real 
estate contract. In the Contract Processing screen, choose the Settlement Participation tab. The rental objects 
that are assigned to the contract are listed in the Selectable Objects table. When you have assigned the rental 
objects to a settlement unit, the settlement participation appears in the Settlement Participation tab for each 
selected rental object with the status  
 Generated. You can change the participation type and the validity 
period of the generated settlement participation of the rental object (Figure  6-8 ).

 Pre-requisites to Configuring Service Charge Settlement 
 To enable  the  use of REFX, we need to define a company code and controlling area at the enterprise level 
and activate the Financial Extension (Application Indicator EA-FIN) within the SAP R/3 Enterprise extension 
set. Also, activation of the BTE application (RE) is required to ensure  business transactions events (BTE)   
related to other modules. After this, the real estate extension needs to be activated (Figure  6-9 ).

 To enable the use of REFX, the following configuration is required to be set at the company-code level 
(Figure  6-10 ):

 It states whether the uniqueness of an object is to be maintained or not. Select 
checkboxes for Functional Location, Asset Assignment, WBS Multiple, Order 
Multiple, or Multiple Cost Center, which means you can have multiple real estate 
objects set in the same time in the same period for the order. No checkmark here 
means you can assign only one real estate object in the period. Selecting Asset 
Mandatory means it is mandatory to assign the fixed asset to the real estate object.  
• 
 Default Units of  Measurement 
 
 Area Unit, Volume Unit, Unit of Length options specify the units of measurement 
for the area, volume, and length per the company code as a default value for the 
business entity. 
 In order to ensure the account’s assignment to a real estate object we need to activate real estate 
management in the Controlling Area screen (Figure  6-13 ).

 Configurations for Service Charge Settlements in REFX 
 The Flexible Real  Estate module comes under the accounting part of SAP and can be accessed in SPRO as 
shown in Figure  6-14 . SAP service charge settlements are a part of the SAP Flexible Real Estate management 
module, which enables service charge settlement of all types to be incurred in SAP  REFX  .  
 Figure 6-13.  “Activate  components/control indicators ”: Details 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SERVICE CHARGE SETTLEMENTS
85
 Service Charge Settlement configurations are available in SPRO under: 
 Menu Path 
 IMG ➤ Flexible Real Estate Management ➤ Service Charge Settlement 
 Set  Service Charge Keys 
 The service charge keys determine the type of expenses, and the settlement units determine the various 
service charges that need to be settled. 
 Menu Path 
 IMG ➤ RE-FX ➤ Service Charge Settlement ➤ Master Data of Settlement Unit ➤ Service Charge Keys 
 Service charge keys are used for the settlement of expenses under different heads. Standard service charge 
keys are available considering various heads of expenses required to be incurred. However, any new expense 
head can be added based upon the requirements. Default values can be set for service charge keys (Figure  6-15 ). 
The next step would be to enter the measurement details and check  the heating value day’s indicator.  
 Figure 6-14.  Service Charge Settlement  node is found under Flexible Real Estate Management (REFX) in SPRO       
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SERVICE CHARGE SETTLEMENTS
86
 A service charge key denotes the type of costs that a real estate object incurs. Not all costs incurred are 
apportionable, and we need to distinguish between costs chargeable to tenants and costs that cannot be 
charged to them (Figure  6-16 ). 
 Figure 6-15.  “Service Charge Key”:  Overview 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SERVICE CHARGE SETTLEMENTS
87
 Default Values  for Distribution Rule of Settlement Unit 
 When a settlement  unit is created, the system first checks if an entry was created for the given service 
charge key. If there is no entry, then the system defaults to the measurement type that was entered in the 
characteristics of the service charge key. Though default values can be mentioned in the Service Charge Keys 
link, for some service charge keys that is not enough, since they need to settle, for instance, 60% by usable 
space and 40% by consumption. In this step you can specify these more complex rules as defaults (Figure  6-17 ).

 Settlement Variants 
 Any settlement needs a period for which it is required to be carried out.  Settlement variant is an accounting 
variant created for the period of the settlement. The variant can be a single period valid for 12 months or can 
be various settlement periods. Users can create, edit, display, and delete settlement variants from the link 
(Figure  6-18 ).

 The following is an example of one settlement variant, A005 (Figure  6-19 ). UM corresponds to the month, 
UD to the day, and AD to the annual displacement, which is used to determine the settlement year 
depending on the value date of a document for the service charge settlement.

 Tenancy Laws 
 The tenancy laws of some countries provide rules for the distribution of heating expenses as per the specific 
location (Figure   6-20  ). This determines if part of the heating cost will be passed to tenants or whether there 
is a system to distribute it, as per the regional locations’ tenancy laws.

 Heating Days 
 In case heating expenses are to be distributed as per regional location or as per percentage of the heating 
area, the period and the percentage of the value of the expenses need to be selected. We need to define the 
regional locations before carrying out such distribution.

 Refer to the following examples. Munich and Zurich are regional locations here (Figure  6-21 ), and the 
heating value percentage (Figure  6-22 ) is defined against that. 
 Define Default Values for  Current Occupancy Principle 
 We may define for each service charge key which default settings are valid for new settlement units based on 
the current occupancy principle (Figure  6-23 ). The Current Occupancy Principle indicator can only be set 
for rental units and rental spaces, not for pooled spaces.

 Usage  Types for  Service Charge Settlements 
 We must define all rental objects for which the service charge settlement is to be performed. The user needs 
to define all usage types that would need a service charge settlement to be performed on them. A usage type 
against which we set an indicator can participate in the service charge settlement, and those for which you 
do not set an indicator cannot participate (Figure  6-34 ). Rental objects are in turn assigned to usage types 
through participation groups.

 Define Measurement  Types 
 Measurements are used to record the measurable part of objects. The measurement type indicates the type 
of trait that is being measured. The measurements of a rental object are used in service charge settlement 
for determining apportionment. In the case of real estate objects, we can have total area, office area, parking 
area, and so on, which are occupying a specific area of total available space and are created as measurement 
types (Figure  6-35  and Figure  6-36 ).

 Define Characteristics and  Measuring Point Category  
 A rental object whose characteristics are consumption dependent can use a measuring point category for 
the apportionment of service charges based on consumption; for example, power usage in a building. We 
need to define the characteristic and then create measuring point categories for the same (Figure  6-37 ). The 
characteristics can be created in characteristic classes. The characteristics cannot be transported, but rather 
have to be manually created in the target system. Here, we determine the characteristics for meters and the 
measuring point categories.

blank, in which case a condition type is settled to all service charge keys in a 
service charge group. 
 
 2. 
 User makes an entry for the condition type for each service charge key, in which case a 
condition type is settled against the specified service charge key. Refer to Figure  6-43 ,

 CHAPTER 7  
 Sales-Based Contracts 
 In this chapter, we will explain the options available for  sales-based contracts, the steps required to carry 
out sales-based settlements, and the different options available for those settlements. In this chapter, we will 
discuss the following:
• 
 Sales rule and reporting rule 
• 
 Sales-based contract  
• 
 Sales-based rent settlement 
 Let us understand this using a business scenario. 
 Take a fast food restaurant that is let out by the company Purna Multinational Retail Limited to Samurai 
Fireworks Limited for monthly rent. It can be either fixed monthly rent or variable rent, which is based on the 
sales effected at the restaurant and varies from month to month. There is a minimum rent clause dictating 
that the tenant has to pay even if no sales take place. Also, the receivable varies based on the sales slab, and 
a percentage can be defined for different slabs. The functionality is also useful in places like airports, where 
rent is charged based on sales in duty-free shops. We need to calculate rent based on sales figures for a 
particular period. 
 Sales Rule and Reporting Rule 
 The sales-based rent condition is used to specify which objects of the sales-based rent agreement form the 
basis for sales-based rent. A  sales rule defines the selection of parameters for carrying out a sales-based 
settlement. For example, in order to settle all sales promotion expenses, a sales rule needs to be created. We 
must specify sales rules for sales-based rent conditions, otherwise settlement is not possible. A contract can 
have more than one sales rule, but each rule needs to be assigned to sales-based rent conditions. We can 
assign a sales rule from zero to any number of minimum sales-based rent conditions. 
 The  reporting rule is used to determine which sales types are considered for calculating the sales-
based rent. We may have different sales types, like food sales, beer sales, clothing, and so on, that have to be 
defined in the reporting rule to enable the calculation of rent against those sales. 
 We can also enter the following:
• 
 Gross/net sales numbers in field for net or gross sales reported  
• 
  The minimum and maximum sales amount based on which rent is calculated can be 
defined in the contract as a simple amount or as per a grading method in which we 
define for what sales slab what percentage of rent is charged. If the sales-based rent is 
to be calculated using a linear (not x-graded) calculation on the basis of sales, then the 
% rate (percentage rate) needs to be defined. With graded sales-based rent, sales limits 
are required to be entered; i.e., from maybe 1,000 to 5,000, 5,000 to 10,000, and so on.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ SALES-BASED CONTRACTS
114
• 
 Minimum/maximum quantitative sales in units or measures can be entered, and 
system calculates rent based on units or measures    
 Sales-based rent contract creation and settlement steps are shown in detail next.  
 Sales-Based Agreement 
 In order to post receivables to the customer account in case any space has been leased out to alliance 
partners based on a  sales-based agreement , a contract needs to be created in SAP. In such cases, it will be a 
lease-out contract. 
 Trigger 
 The creation of contract in SAP should only be done after the agreement has been signed between business 
partners and all necessary approvals have been obtained by the respective role holders. 
 Prerequisites 
 Before the contract can be created, necessary master data objects should have been created in the system, 
like the business entity, pooled space, and rental space. A business partner role also needs to be created for 
the customer with whom the alliance has been made.

 CO01 – Commercial lease-out contract 
 For a sales-based contract, on the General Data tab page of the contract, activate the checkbox by 
ticking the “Relevant to Sales” button. An additional tab for Sales-Based Agreement gets activated, and the 
sales-based agreement values can be captured there. 
 In case of retail contracts where more than one object will be assigned to the contract, we can create an 
object group in the object assignment and add the rental objects to this object group.

 For a retail business, in the object assignment we can create an object group first and then add the 
rental objects and assign them to this object group. Only rental objects belonging to the same territory can 
be assigned to an object group, and only to one object group per contract. For example, Fast Food mall has 
counters in many regions  In this case, contracts will have to be created, one per region, with all the rental 
objects assigned to one object group in the contract.

 Summary 
 In this chapter, we studied how sales-based rent contracts are created in the system and how we can use 
them for business requirements to calculate rent based on different parameters. We also saw how to settle 
these contracts by using the periodic posting functionality, where rent is calculated based on various 
criterions.

 CHAPTER 8  
 Industry Best Practices 
 This chapter will explain  industry best practices for implementation/ rollout   and maintenance of SAP REFX, 
the  team composition and skillset required, and competency building. The chapter is divided into the 
following topics:
• 
 Best practices for implementation/rollout 
• 
 Team composition and skill matrix required  
• 
 Competency building 
 Best Practices for Implementation/Rollout 
 In this chapter, we will discuss the best practices for  implementation/rollout of SAP REFX, specifically in the 
following aspects:
• 
 Approaches for speedy and effective implementation of SAP REFX  
• 
 The value of organizational preparedness 
• 
 The need for strong executive sponsorship 
• 
 The importance of documented processes, business cases, and training 
• 
 Key success factors 
• 
 Living with SAP REFX 
  Organizations planning   on replacing legacy systems that are unable to keep up with increasing business 
require a state-of-the-art integrated solution, such as SAP REFX. Organizations are always looking to find 
answers to a variety of questions relating to the solution, such as its necessity, its functionalities, and, more 
important, how it can meet the firm’s needs. Best practices and effective approaches for speedy and effective 
implementation are other considerations. 
 SAP REFX  implementation is a key transformation initiative, and successful implementation is the 
responsibility of all who are part of organization. Companies must ask themselves the following questions:
• 
 What are key success factors for the success of the initiative?  
• 
 Do we have strong executive sponsorship, ideally from the business organization, to 
ensure strong business team support? 
• 
 Do we have a sufficient budget sanctioned for such an initiative? 

CHAPTER 8 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES
152
• 
 Are all critical business requirements in functional areas met for this 
implementation? 
• 
 Have we identified key resources from business and other functions that will form 
the core group and ensured their availability for the implementation initiative? 
• 
 Are we prepared for managing the training needs of the organization? 
 Based on responses to the preceding questions, one can judge if more work needs to be done to 
prepare the organization for change or if it is ready to start the transformation journey. A roadmap of the 
organization post–REFX implementation needs to be thought out and visualized before the initiation of the 
preparatory phase. To begin, all persons on the implementation team have to be aware of the broader vision 
of the organization, its goals, and how the SAP REFX initiative will help in achieving that vision. What are the 
organization’s goals and the vision it carries, and how can the SAP REFX implementation enable it to achieve 
these goals? 
 Since you are thinking of replacing the legacy system of your organization, you need an integrated 
system that will be scalable and functionally rich to support your vision of the organization. A solution 
should be capable of improving productivity, customer centricity, and the effectiveness of communication 
within the organization’s ecosystem. 
 When is the right time to start implementation? The answer is certainly not  immediately , but rather only 
after considering some key aspects. 
 Executive Commitment 
 Executive commitment  is crucial to ensuring a successful, on-schedule implementation that is within the 
sanctioned budget, and hence it is important to know the project sponsor’s place in the organization and 
how much influence he or she has within the organization. Many project sponsors do not focus on the 
project and are busy in regular business activities, considering implementation as a side activity. However, 
regular contact with the executive sponsor is a must; the sponsor should be involved from the kickoff to the 
end. The best project sponsors take a keen interest and spend the requisite time on the project. Obtaining 
a full commitment from all stakeholders is essential and needs to be ensured before the start of the project. 
Typically, executives will say that they support such transformation initiatives, but when it comes to 
releasing funds and key resources for the project, they may not support the project team completely. It is 
a good practice to conduct review meetings to discuss progress and pending tasks so as to reiterate the 
commitment made at the start of the project. The project sponsor should begin the kickoff meeting by clearly 
communicating the vision of the organization and business case for the initiative to make sure everyone is 
aware of their responsibilities and the deliverables expected from them. 
 Build a Business Case for  Positive Return on Investment 
 The rationale behind building a  business case is to justify the investment requested for the project. Also, 
it helps in onboarding correctly skilled resources from business functions on a dedicated basis. Business 
needs may entail achieving cost reduction, greater customer service, improving system performance, or 
reducing processing time. We have to ensure that we have a sound business case that details the background 
of the project, benefits envisaged, and how it is going to contribute to the overall vision of the organization. 
A business case is a presentation of data with views from relevant stakeholders. A new SAP REFX system 
provides your organization with fresh opportunities to use and refine new business processes, and a 
business case–building exercise is the first activity in this journey. A business case should talk of business 
drivers, pain areas, improvement expected by suggested solution, competition, and change-management 
requirements, if any, due to the impact of new initiatives. The team can help educate the organization’s 
business team on technologies that can help them to achieve business objectives in an easy way. Return on

investment needs to be presented, and senior management’s concerns need to be addressed. As the owner 
of the business case and guardian of the investors’ interests, the project sponsor must be the one to secure 
buy-in from every stakeholder. 
 Build a  Case 
 The project sponsor should share his or her vision and communicate to the larger part of the organization 
as to what the team is planning to do, how you are going to do this, what help you need, and how it will 
bring about change for the better. The project sponsor should reach out to the maximum number of people 
by organizing meetings, conducting workshops where key team members will speak to clarify any doubts, 
sharing his or her own thoughts about the initiative, and improving overall understanding. This will help to 
reduce any resistance employees have and address any concerns that might prevent them from participating 
wholeheartedly. 
 Core Group Formation 
 You need to onboard the best talent from various organizational units to create a core group that will be 
responsible for ensuring successful implementation/rollout. The core group has to drive the transformation 
initiative by using their experience in the organization; the group has to be formed with the right mix of 
talent to ensure continued success throughout the journey and thereafter. The core group should consist of 
the right mix of senior and junior members—senior and experienced individuals who have deep business 
knowledge and younger people to provide energy and optimism; seniors may offer insights gained from 
experience. We may create the following four groups in the core team:
• 
 Steering committee (two to three members): To facilitate, monitor, and guide the rest 
of the teams 
• 
 Change control board (three to four members): To review and approve changes to 
the scope 
• 
 Selection committee (four to five members): To select the appropriate solution  
• 
 Project teams and leadership: Choose a program manager and project leaders for 
every project team. 
 Ensure Resource Commitment 
 SAP implementation is perceived as a corporate initiative launched from the head office, and employees in 
the other offices tend to believe that it is the core team’s responsibility to implement the change. No initiative 
will be successful unless end organizations are aligned to initiatives and onboarded correctly. Besides 
corporate, we need commitment and involvement from branches, factories, and other units, and to get this 
commitment, we need to conduct regional-level workshops to which we should invite participation from the 
all locations and support functions. 
 Manage  Change 
 New initiatives like implementation will bring about a change in the system, processes, or way in which the 
organization is operating. New business models will require a change in the way business operations are 
managed. People who are used to a specific way of working may need to understand and adopt new ways 
aligned to the initiative. This is possible only if it is communicated clearly to employees and all stakeholders 
who are impacted. We need to make sure that every employee, irrespective of designation, role, location, 

CHAPTER 8 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES
154
seniority, and skill set, is made aware of the changes. People must gain an understanding of why the change 
in strategy or in culture is needed and how it will affect them, covering in particular modifications in their 
roles, responsibilities, location, and teams. People generally resist change in the beginning. This is when the 
respective managers must act and connect with them and communicate the benefits of such a change in 
technology and process, and explain the need for it. 
 Manage  Own Expectations 
 Business requirements are changing, as are statutory and compliance requirements. You have been making 
changes to cope with these changes. All this is either captured in one of the systems or is part of the manual 
work being carried out by your teams. You should not expect everything to undergo change in one attempt, 
certainly not at the size of transformation we are discussing. There may not be any single solution that meets 
all business-specific requirements, and customization (major or minor) may be required. You need to set 
expectations internally as to what the new system can support, what workaround is required, and what 
process changes may be necessary. Acceptance from users will likely be greater if they are aware of what to 
expect from the transformation and what not to expect. 
 Identify Potential  Risk 
 Every project is exposed to risks; you cannot have a project without risk. If we do not mitigate even a small 
risk, it can become a major hurdle to optimally delivering the project. Therefore, the identification of risk 
at an early stage is essential. Thorough analysis of risks and initiating appropriate preventive measures is a 
must to avoid risks. Deviations, short supply, idle time, inadequate communication, lack of preparedness, 
and overruns are some of the risks you should be able to identify easily.  
 Have Clear Interface Requirements 
 Identify every single  interface requirement of these processes with respect to give and take of data, 
frequency, use, size, volume, and current mechanism. This will help you in building a conference room pilot 
or testing rollouts. Real challenges are mentioned here:
• 
 The system landscape is not the same at every location.  
• 
 The processes are different. 
• 
 The level of automation is different. 
• 
 Regulatory requirements differ from place to place.  
• 
 Many processes are not documented, or are incomplete.  
• 
 No central team has been appointed to control the version or approve changes. 
 Use Reports, Key Performance Indicators, and Dashboards 
 You need to keep an inventory of reports on your organization’s processes as well as the distribution list 
agreed upon. You may need different kinds of reports based on your organization’s requirements. You will 
also want to identify  key performance indicators by process, creating a matrix of tasks or activities by role 
for the  dashboard . The REFX system’s strong reporting provides most of the reporting needs to fulfill real 
estate’s requirements. Moreover, you may use this opportunity to look into these  reports to see if any can be 
consolidated or eliminated altogether. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES
155
 Clean the Master Data 
 Most of the organizations today are struggling to keep track of  master data   and avoid duplication of it. 
A lot of investment is made in ensuring master data is correctly maintained so as to get a single version 
of truth. A disciplined approach is required to ensure the correctness of this data. It is the responsibility 
of the organization to ensure the quality of master data on land, building, rental objects, and other real 
estate objects is maintained. A centralized team managing the maintenance and creation of master data is 
recommended. It should not be left to many agencies to maintain and create master data in order to avoid 
duplication. It is suggested that you clean master data and synchronize them with the REFX application 
before we start implementation. 
 Role-Based Access Control 
 Granting access to a user for the SAP REFX system will depend on his assigned role and responsibilities. 
The right to create real estate master data may reside with a central team. Some users may get access to read 
transactions but not to modify them. It is required to do a complete analysis and create a matrix to identify 
roles based on the responsibilities of each employee. The segregation of duties needs to be ensured, and 
you may observe conflicts during the data-collection process. You need to document all such findings and 
address these conflicts during role creation. 
 Validate the Solution Against Architecture Guiding Principles 
 Every organization has certain  guiding principles , and any new solution must be reviewed and validated 
against them. Deviations must be identified and their impact reviewed and agreed on. This needs to 
be discussed with a solution architect. Bring to his or her notice any deviation and find a workaround 
before moving forward with the new solution. Every location may have different processes and a different 
understanding of the solution, but your organization likely needs to work on the following:
• 
 Have a globally standardized process, with localization (permissible only in the case 
of statutory or compliance requirements) in documented form and controlled at a 
central location by team 
• 
 Ensure updating and modifications to its processes to accommodate what it desires 
to achieve 
• 
 Create an internal knowledge portal where these processes are captured and 
anybody can refer to them 
 Team Composition and Skill Matrix Required 
 Successful project delivery largely depends on having a competent  team ; getting the right set of experienced 
people is a major challenge. Project sponsors struggle to get SAP REFX–specific functional and technical 
consultants to work on the project, but existing and past implementations bring an experienced pool 
of resources into the market. Ideally, the team should be composed of a reasonable number of domain 
consultants with a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of real estate processes who are able to 
validate business requirements and identify deviations from the standard offering of the product. In other 
words, consultants who are capable of ensuring error-free delivery. Your organization should select the right 
service providers to ensure experienced resources for the various roles required. 
 Process harmonization is the first step in getting ready for such a major transformation initiative. 
Harmonized and standardized processes should also consider local needs in the area of taxation and 
country/product-specific documentation. This helps in having complete and comprehensive blueprinting 

CHAPTER 8 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES
156
for SAP REFX. These documented processes help as a reference guide for every individual in the 
organization. Based on the preceding factors and the importance of such a program, we recommend the 
following roles at the corporate and program level. 
 Steering Committee 
 The  steering committee needs to be formed by the project sponsor once management approves the 
business case. The steering committee should consist of identified leaders from various departments, 
such as production, finance, procurement, sales, services, risk and compliance, quality control, business 
development, planning, and technology. The chief information officer (CIO) generally heads the committee 
and reports to the project sponsor on a regular basis. The function of the committee is to steer the program, 
guide the team, resolve conflicts, and decide on critical issues to help with the smooth running of the 
program. The committee is responsible for vendor selection and contracting with them, and monitoring 
the progress of the program. The committee is required to evaluate if expenditures are within budget and 
objectives planned initially are achieved. It is suggested that the committee meets once a month and reviews 
progress. 
 Enterprise Architect 
 An  enterprise architect plays an important role in a transformation program like SAP REFX and needs to 
be supported by functional and technical architects. Business architects will work on changes and impact 
on business due to the new system, suggest areas of improvement, and ensure harmonization of processes. 
Technical architects will ensure that design principles are followed and architecture guidelines are adhered 
to. They understand both the existing technology landscape and the proposed system and vision provided 
in the business case. Both business and technical architects work under the leadership of the enterprise 
architect to ensure smooth implementation of the SAP REFX program. It is also advisable that a detailed 
review of the architecture framework by industry experts be undertaken, as new technology platforms, 
offerings, and models are evolving rapidly. 
 Program Manager 
 The  program manager is a single point of contact (SPOC) for the program. He or she is a person who 
is recommended to have experience in managing large programs, preferably in the area of real estate. 
Experience in delivering large SAP programs is a plus. 
 The project sponsor should appoint the program manager at the time when the steering committee is 
being formed. The program manager creates scope documents for appointing vendors, identifies the risks 
associated with the program, and provides a mitigation plan. He or she is also involved in creating change-
management and critical-resource plans; capturing dependencies; and devising a program organization 
structure, measurement criteria, an induction plan, and a reporting mechanism. 
 Whether it be a pilot, a partial implementation, or an organizational-level implementation, these roles 
are necessary at the corporate level to achieve success with your program.  
 Domain Consultant (SME) 
 Domain consultant  is a key role for the success of an SAP REFX implementation. A consultant who has 
worked in a real estate organization can appreciate the challenges and difficulties faced by different roles 
within a company. He or she is therefore properly equipped to capture requirements correctly and helps in 
providing the right solution. A domain consultant with experience in implementing SAP REFX is preferable; 
however, a consultant with experience implementing SAP FICO can also meet project needs with some 

CHAPTER 8 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES
157
grooming and training. It is a challenge to get a consultant who has a thorough understanding of both 
domain and technology; i.e., SAP REFX. Therefore, based on implementation strategy, we need to select 
domain consultants either by line of business or by business processes. Domain consultants can conduct 
workshops and will be able to connect with business users easily, as they will talk in the same language 
as business understands. He or she can capture information like various roles played by consultant, data 
requirements, pain areas, compliance needs, localization requirements, if any, and volume of transactions. 
 SAP REFX Functional Consultant 
 An SAP REFX  functional consultant should have good SAP FI knowledge and should be a hands-on person. 
He or she should know AR, AP, GL, and Asset accounting thoroughly. How vendor and customer accounting 
is handled, how transactions are posted in FI system, how revenue and cost are recorded, and so on should 
be clear to him or her. Domain knowledge is also desirable, but at least core SAP FI and basic controlling 
knowledge is required. The main responsibility of an SAP REFX functional consultant is to work with the 
domain consultant, map business requirements in SAP REFX, and configure systems that meet business 
requirements. 
 SAP REFX Technical Consultant 
 The SAP REFX  technical consultant must have strong knowledge of  advanced business application 
programming (ABAP) and hands-on experience with the SAP REFX ecosystem. 
 SAP Process Integration (PI)  Consultant 
 An SAP PI has to connect SAP REFX with non-SAP systems, whether ERP or not, and third-party products 
if used in organization by vendors, customers, and other agencies. The SAP PI consultant builds these 
interfaces to ensure seamless integration of data flow between both systems. SAP REFX also requires 
interfacing with GIS, business intelligence (BI), and other systems. A, SAP PI consultant with hands-on 
experience should be brought on board. 
 SAP  Finance and Controlling (FICO) Consultant 
 SAP REFX is part of SAP FI, and you may need an SAP FICO consultant to do basic FICO settings. The SAP 
FICO consultant is needed to configure financial settings in SAP REFX. If SAP FICO is already implemented, 
you may have the configuration ready in the system. REFX is integrated with Finance and Controlling for 
managing customer receipts and vendor payments through accounts receivable (AR), accounts payable 
(AP), general ledger (GL), cost center, and profit center. 
 Quality Assurance  Consultant 
 The quality assurance consultant is somebody who knows business better than any external agency 
does. We should onboard the position from internal senior and experienced team members. In case your 
organization outsources testing activity and appoints an external vendor to run your test factory, he or she 
should be one experienced with both the testing and the domain. Testing and quality control are important, 
because REFX interfaces with most of your landscape as well as outside it. Ensure that batch processes are 
running as expected and all the interfaces, functionalities, and custom-built functionalities are working. It is 
recommended you collocate your entire program team for better coordination.  

CHAPTER 8 ■ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES
158
 Rollout Team 
 Rollout partners are best enlisted toward the last phase of implementation of the global template. They 
should shadow the implementation team during the warranty stage at the first site. You need all the skills 
of the implementation team to carry out the rollouts, but not in the same numbers. We need to choose 
consultants from the existing team who will continue in rollouts. Retain consultants with multiple skill 
sets. Also, the competency level required for implementation is higher than that needed for rollout. Rollout 
consultants should have knowledge of the implementing country or site-specific localization. Different 
countries have different legal and statutory requirements; these must be addressed while rolling out the 
standard template. Forms and documents may also be required in the local language(s) and format. The 
implementation team conducts workshops to share solution details, architecture aspects, environment, 
configuration, user setup, and documentation with rollout leadership. 
 The corporate team continues throughout the rollouts. It is good practice to retain a few key resources 
from the implementation team for the initial rollouts. These resources can act as mentors to the rollout 
teams. The steering committee appoints one or more rollout partners and release-management partners, 
depending on the number of sites and time allotted. 
 SAP REFX Team  Ramp-Up and Competency-Building Plan 
 SAP REFX  implementation is a key initiative for organizations and requires a number of experienced and 
trained SAP REFX resources to manage implementation and multiple rollouts and provide support. We need 
to build competency by choosing good SAP Finance consultants and training them on the REFX module. 
This should cover all end-to-end processes that the team may need to configure in sand box and carry all 
posting, settlement runs, and other routine postings through to REFX. 
 Summary 
 We explained best practices for SAP REFX implementation and rollouts, team composition and skill matrix 
required, and competency building plan.

 CHAPTER 9  
 Transformation Impact of SAP 
REFX Implementation 
 This chapter will explain  transformation impact on a business post–REFX implementation and the impact 
of new-dimension products like  S4 HANA,  big data,  Mobility,    analytics,   and  social media   on SAP REFX. The 
chapter is divided into the following topics:
• 
 Business transformation 
• 
 New-dimension products 
• 
 Business case justification for investment 
 Business Transformation 
 What is business  transformation ? It is a major organizational change to  plan and aligns the People, Process, 
and Technology initiatives of a company with its business strategy and vision. It is a strategic and holistic 
transformation process across the business aiming toward achieving the corporate vision. A key enabler for 
business transformation is technology. Big data, the Cloud, Internet Of things, social media emergence, and 
mobility have changed the rules of the game and the competitive scenario by evolving new business models 
and value chains. The transformation of the IT landscape to make it adaptive to new business models is a 
key focus going forward. Typical transformation projects include mergers and acquisitions, outsourcing 
and offshoring, restructuring, value-chain optimization, and information systems redesign. These involve 
external consulting firms to carry out a major transformation within the organization. IT transformation 
is no longer a separate initiative, but rather is a major component of any overall business transformation. 
Innovation is one of the key drivers of transformation. Managing global real estate assets is a challenge due 
to ever-changing rules and regulations from country to country as well as rising customer expectations, both 
of which are forcing real estate players to innovate. In the development of trade and commerce, efficient 
management of real estate assets is essential to staying competitive in the market, and any failure on this 
point can result in loss. Hence, players managing real estate are under constant pressure to ensure cost-
effective operations with reduced complexity. They need to improve efficiency via better forecasting and 
gaining more insight into market trends. 
 Generally,  real estate players are expected to do the following:
• 
 Enhance usage of the real estate portfolio through efficient space utilization 
strategies, locating vacant and unutilized space in the portfolio that can be either 
leased or sold and having an accurate and prompt reporting system that reflects 
vacant and unoccupied space in order to manage it  effectively  
• 
 Optimize space utilization of the leased and owned real estate portfolio 

CHAPTER 9 ■ TRANSFORMATION IMPACT OF SAP REFX IMPLEMENTATION
160
• 
 Keep close control over lease agreements and expirations, reduce operating costs, 
have strategies for reducing utility expenses 
• 
 Prepare a short-term and a long-term plan for effective management and utilization 
of real estate and facilities inventory 
• 
 Taxes and other statutory payments are accurately worked out for space and 
amenities owned/occupied and no excess payment is made 
• 
 Generate accurate operational reports to help prompt decision making    
 In order to meet the preceding expectations, real estate players are looking out for integrated solutions 
that meet organizations’ transformational aspirations and investing in software solutions that support 
standard processes, provide best practices for the industry, and reduce customization so as to deliver 
maximum return on investment. 
 We strongly suggest you select a solution and invest in it if it provides the following  benefits :
• 
 Real-time availability of data for meaningful analysis and quick corrective action is 
expected from a new solution. For example, the availability of real-time information 
of real estate assets like land, building, plant, and other assets will help in ensuring 
predictive maintenance and replacement readiness.  
• 
 The ability to analyze large volumes of data to generate meaningful insights; for 
instance, real estate master data analytics to determine utilization of assets, vacant 
objects, lease administration, forecasting of valuations, and minimizing overhead 
costs. 
• 
 Integrated solutions providing a single view of data throughout the organization, 
ensuring a single source of truth and effective control. Real estate master data like 
property, building, and rental spaces should be providing the same view to all 
stakeholders. 
• 
 Ability to quickly respond to customers by capturing, interpreting, and analyzing 
feedback on social media sites. 
 In nutshell, you need integrated solutions that provide real-time information about the status of assets, 
enabling analytical support to interpret structured and unstructured data. Hence, we suggest the SAP REFX 
solution, which is strong enough to address these requirements. We also believe that the implementation of 
SAP REFX can help you obtain early return on investment. 
 New-Dimension Products 
 Let us see in detail the transformation impact of  new-dimension products   such as big data, HANA, mobility, 
Cloud, and social media in detail. 
 Big Data 
 Big data is a large volume of structured and unstructured data and can be analyzed to improve decision 
making and strategic business moves. The amount of data that’s generated and stored is growing at an 
alarming pace, but we are able to capture and analyze only a small percentage of data that can help decision 
making. It is a big challenge for any organization to capture information that flows into it and interpret it to 
improve efficiency. Customer relationship building is critical to the real estate industry—and that can be 
achieved by managing big data in an effective manner. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ TRANSFORMATION IMPACT OF SAP REFX IMPLEMENTATION
161
 Today’s organizations are challenged by increasing costs—construction, infrastructure, and facility 
overhead are substantial expense categories for many organizations. Real estate players try to reduce the 
total cost of occupancy through strategies and finding new ways to leverage that information to enhance 
consumer satisfaction. In-memory databases like SAP HANA allow you to extract an enormous volume 
of structured and unstructured data from a single place and analyze it in an efficient manner. Advanced 
analytics enable you to quickly analyze that data to provide better insights and predict future trends. Cloud 
platforms can make the resulting insights available to the right people at the right time and at an affordable 
cost. Investments in the retail sector are generally based on the area where the property is situated, but 
based on behavior trends of actual consumers, you can make smarter decisions about where to acquire 
or develop a property and start a venture, and if property is owned or leased, what kinds of rents are 
appropriate, and more. All the new data we are acquiring can help to attract more and more customers in 
innovative ways. Both the retailer and mall owner will benefit, as retailers will be able to maximize revenues 
and mall owners will be able to increase rental income and have better retention of tenants. 
 Organizations with extensive lease portfolios are faced with the huge task of tracking numerous 
leases with varying expiration dates and different terms of tenancy. The chance for errors is high if we use 
manual systems to keep track of these requirements. Customer complaints, inaccurate information, missed 
renewal dates, monetary penalties, and so on are possible in a manual system. Facility management is a 
major cost factor for businesses since buildings, especially large office blocks, consume enormous amounts 
of electricity, water, and gas and need regular maintenance. Better insights into the data and the factors 
influencing a building’s performance can help significantly reduce resource consumption and improve 
environmental performance. 
 SAP HANA Solutions 
 SAP HANA is an in-memory platform for processing a large amount of data in real time. It is at the center 
of SAP’s technology strategy, with new innovations like S4 HANA, which is based on the HANA database. 
SAP HANA enables businesses to access transactional data in real time and to analyze large volumes of data 
quickly. A few SAP HANA–based solutions are available for the real estate industry. SAP HANA’s adoption 
is growing in the real estate segment as more and more organizations are planning to move to HANA to get 
the benefits of real-time information, faster processing, and the predictive capabilities of the solution to stay 
competitive in the business. 
 Mobility 
 The real estate industry is highly human dependent, and organizations are challenged to meet the multiple 
and ever-growing requirements of various stakeholders. Real estate managers who are required to lease 
properties need to deal with various stakeholders like vendors, tenants, buyers, and banks. Real estate agents 
who are buying and selling properties for their customers need to have a solution that can be accessed on 
the fly and is device supported. Gone are the days where agents used to capture information on personal 
computers and need to go to the office to access it. If an agent is showing any property to a customer, he 
needs to have real-time information about the property to conclude the deal successfully. Integration with 
enterprise CRM systems provides quick and easy access to the information required for capturing and 
tracking lead status. As real estate is a people-centered business, real estate professionals must keep up 
with the demands of their consumers. Mobile technologies integrated with SAP can address most of these 
challenges. Mobile devices in the field can capture real estate data and share them with a central server on 
which an SAP REFX platform is installed. The information can thus be made available ahead of time for 
planning. Information on the vacancy of objects, lease term expiration, rent outstanding, utility payment 
due dates and other relevant data can be easily populated in the system and used internally or sent to 
customers and vendors. Thus, you can enhance productivity and customer service at a reduced operational 
cost. Mobile technologies that can be deployed are the Global Positioning System (GPS) for tracking assets

and location-based services; radio frequency identification (RFID) for locating real estate assets; RFID 
readers and scanners for faster scans; and mobile phones with business applications for inquiries, updates, 
and two-way communication. 
 Consumers want instant information, but fulfilling that expectation of an immediate response time is 
difficult for real estate companies who don’t have mobile-enabled technology and won’t be able to compete 
with other real estate companies who continue to make information available online in order to approach 
their consumers. 
 Mobile solutions that are integrated with Google Maps help agents and real estate managers provide 
complete information access. A 3D view of the property with improved images enables the viewing of 
property on tablet devices, and you need not physically visit the site to view the property.  
 Social Media Integration 
 Given the increased use of social networks worldwide, social media is opening up new business opportunities 
by creating two-way communication, enabling customer feedback and response in real time. It is important 
for the real estate industry to tap the potential of social media to drive efficiencies and connect with customers 
and business partners. Information and feedback on social media is vital information for sales and support 
functions. Analysis and interpretation of it is often a challenge, as information is not in a structured format. Social 
media allows the sharing of information relevant to the industry, such as updates on real estate prices, market 
trends, vacant space availability, and new compliance requirements relating to property, complaints, feedback, 
and views. Modern businesses are proactively handling customer issues and complaints through Facebook 
and Twitter. Many real estate players are posting property details on Twitter to help find customers, and visual 
presentations are shared on social media to attract them. Recorded videos and demonstrations showing unique 
differentiators of services can have a positive impact on customers. Social media is complementary to the real 
estate business. Integration with social media is important for making full use of SAP. Leading real estate players 
have portals that provide data access to all partners and customers. SAP can share its data, such as the availability 
of real estate properties, buildings, or assets, on social networks. A real estate company using social media to offer 
real estate assets to customers along with SAP can have much wider options for penetrating the market.  
 Analytics 
 Analytics has been used as a tool for reporting historical data to analyze so as to take corrective action for 
the future. However, with technology advancement, it has moved to being a real-time provider of data. The 
next step forward is to analyze trends based on data and predict for the future in order to take proactive 
steps. However, the major challenge is data residing in disparate systems. The availability of integrated 
data can lead to improved efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced customer satisfaction. Organizations 
implementing SAP REFX have this data residing in a single system, saving the time required to obtain data 
and retaining the sanctity of the data. 
 In the Flexible Real Estate Management module, there are reports for the following objects, providing 
key performance indicators, and analytics can be based on these KPIs:
• 
 Master data 
• 
 Real estate contract 
• 
 Measurements 
• 
 Conditions 
• 
 Business partners 
• 
 Service charge settlements 
• 
 Controlling 

CHAPTER 9 ■ TRANSFORMATION IMPACT OF SAP REFX IMPLEMENTATION

 SAP REFX is a data-intensive solution that will generate a wealth of data. It is recommended you review 
its analytics requirements and build a strategy to archive non-critical data and move relevant data, which 
will enable the monitoring of key performance indicators and the creation of dashboards for decision 
makers at every level of the organization. 
 Internet of Things and  Real Estate 
 The concept of the  Internet of Things (IoT) presents unprecedented possibilities for the management and 
operation of real estate. Sensors, a tiny chip, can register changes in temperature, light, pressure, sound, and 
motion. These sensors have been used by city planners and transportation specialists to measure vehicular 
traffic, and data produced helps in determining the capacity for roads and other planning tasks. Sensor 
technology is being applied to commercial real estate and other types of businesses, and the benefits are 
considerable. In terms of property evaluation and market analysis, the information that’s obtained from 
sensors can be tremendously valuable. We can put sensors on the equipment in a building, and every ten 
seconds we get a read on the air temperature, which is helpful in determining if the air conditioning system 
is working efficiently or needs maintenance, and we can generate a work order to fix it. 
 With the emergence of IoT, any part of a real estate object, like a building, can become a point to capture 
and send data for analysis and action. The speed of data transmission and processing time has increased 
tremendously. A scanner can provide basic temperature monitoring and support a building automation 
system that uses IoT, and we can look for an integrated solution that senses and adjusts heat and humidity 
based on the number of people that have entered the building. Advanced analytics combined with IOT can 
change the way real estate operators are managing their business.  
 Cloud Computing 
 More and more businesses are looking for cost-efficient operating solutions, which has led them to the 
adoption of the Cloud. Cloud for real estate will help you keep your agents one step ahead of the competition 
at all times. Your employees will be able to access listings, contracts, and business applications in the office 
or in the field, and it can keep your business up to date with the latest and best technology on the market, 
providing the most efficient collaboration and security for your agents and clients. 
 Commercial real estate businesses are typically operated in the traditional way with hundreds of 
spreadsheets and lot of paper work. The Cloud has made its way in the construction and commercial 
real estate business, changing the way we rent, buy, and sell. With the Cloud at its back end, technology 
is witnessing heights in the real estate sector, helping collect data and collaborating and sharing it on the 
move. Real estate agents and buyers can now carry on cleaner and faster transactions, which ultimately lead 
to time savings and valuable customers’ satisfaction. A number of businesses in real estate are enjoying the 
advantages of cloud computing. 
 Organizations adopting the Cloud will be able to reduce their costs by accessing systems at an 
affordable rate. You can save space used for systems and infrastructure, and smooth and seamless remote 
access allows a greater number of employees to be in the field and operating efficiently. One can be relived 
from IT maintenance duties and focus on the core business once moved to the Cloud. The real estate 
business can extract relevant information and better target customers with ease and simplicity. 
 Now, think of the real estate professional at the airport showing some vacant duty-free shops to a 
potential customer, who requests the details of the operating expenses of the duty-free shops for previous 
years and operating expenses for all shops in the building. The real estate professional can get all this 
information on a mobile device by accessing the company’s database on the Cloud. He or she need not go 
back to the office to get the required details.

 Business Case  Justification for Investment 
 A strong  business case is a prerequisite for committing any information technology investment. A proper 
business case has to be prepared and put up for senior management’s approval before the start of the 
project. This helps in sanctioning funds for the project and also acts as a yardstick to measure the progress 
of the project at each stage. The business case justifies the investment of time, money, and resources into a 
project by outlining the larger benefits that the organization will get by implementing said project. Including 
the necessity of the project, cost, timelines, various options available for addressing the painful area, and 
how the selected option is the best one to meet the overall objective will strengthen the business case. Every 
possible benefit, tangible and intangible, supported by estimated financial workings needs to be hashed out. 
Risks and costs associated with the project need to be clearly mentioned. A calculation of projected costs, 
with justifications for each line of expenditure, is required when requesting approval, and also projected 
timelines for each activity need to be provided. 
 Summary 
 Businesses can get really powerful when technology meets up with the right strategy. The commendable 
era we are in gives us a chance to build the future. The time has come for a change. Real estate is one major 
industry that is becoming complacent with time. Owing to the spectacular technology adoptions, consumer 
acceptance has grown and is rapidly leaving the conventional methods of trading far behind. Accessibility 
has increased. Information can now be reached from anywhere. Customers are enjoying a feeling of control 
and hence are more comfortable trading real estate. For quite a long time, this industry has struggled to keep 
up with the transforming innovations. Now, the time is ripe. Taking the right decisions in the right direction 
will change your business and turn it toward ultimate growth. The SAP REFX platform integrated with 
HANA, a mobility platform, a social media platform, and business intelligence (BI) can give you access to 
real-time information while providing you with analytical capabilities for structured and unstructured data. 
After evaluating the capabilities and features of SAP REFX, we strongly believe that it can help you obtain an 
early return on investment.

 CHAPTER 10  
 Step-by-Step Guide for 
Configuring and Implementing 
SAP REFX 
 In this chapter we will provide a complete business scenario for REFX, with a step-by-step guide for 
configuring the system. We will also cover the master data creation process in detail. The objective is to 
enable the reader to configure REFX  w ith the help of detailed screenshots and provided explanations. 
 Basic Settings in REFX 
 We need to carry out the following steps to configure the SAP REFX system. 
 Activate  Real Estate Extension 
 To be able to use the functions of Flexible Real Estate Management  i n the SAP ECC Extension, the activation 
checkbox has to be checked (Figure  10-1 ).

 Create Basic Settings in  Company Code 
 Here, you create basic settings for company codes that are used in Flexible Real Estate Management 
(Figure  10-2 ). 
 We need to create settings for each company code in which we want to manage real estate objects 
(Figure  10-3 ). Financial Assets Management has to be active in each company code you use.

 Activate Real Estate Management in Controlling Area 
 This configuration is used to activate the  Controlling Area   for some of the features of standard SAP REFX. Set 
Real Estate Management to Active (Figure  10-4 ). 
 For example, by activating Controlling (CO) you can assign accounts to any real estate object in CO 
when posting documents in Financial Accounting module.

 Business Partner Settings in REFX 
 Most real estate processes require the maintenance of data regarding business partners or contacts. Some 
require financial information, such as payable or receivable processing. SAP Real Estate utilizes the central 
SAP Business Partner ( BP) to track information on individuals and entities for financial, contact, and other 
purposes. The BP is linked to the relevant RE data record via business partner roles. Business partner roles 
identify the relationship of the BP to the RE object and its processes. Based on the role, SAP may require critical 
vendor or customer information. Vendor and customer master data will be maintained within Finance, with 
the business partner records being automatically created through business partner synchronization. If a 
customer or vendor is created automatically while creating a business partner, then whenever we make any 
changes in BP, automatically changes get reflected in the customer/vendor via synchronization. 
 Maintain Number Ranges for Business Partner 
 In this activity, you will define  number ranges   for business partners (Figure  10-6 ). Business partners are 
synchronized with FI vendors based on Vendor group. It is possible that the same number range is assigned 
in both the vendor and business partner.

 Master Data in REFX 
 The following are the master data in the SAP REFX system. 
 Define  Measurement Types 
 In this section, you will define measurement  types for business entity, building, rental objects, and contracts 
(Figure  10-16 ). Measurements are used to record measurable traits of objects. The measurement type 
indicates the type of trait that is being measured. Area measurements are also recorded as measurements. 
Measurement types represent all quantifiable attributes, such as space (ft 2 , m 2 , acres, and hectares), 
dimensions (height, linear feet/length), volume (m 3 or ft 3 ), or number (desks, internet connections). 
Measurements can be used to calculate rent (both payable and receivable); to define available, rentable, 
and occupied space; to distribute costs (in service charge settlements or transferring contract costs to RE 
objects); and for cost or revenue-controlling analysis (so-called statistical key figures, such as cost per ft 2 ). 
Measurements will reflect what is currently available within the AutoCAD drawings. These measurements 
will be available on all master data levels when appropriate, and will be the basis for space management 
cost allocations. Due to the nature of customers’ international presence, multiple measurement types 
will be created, reflecting the type utilized within that locality as well as a conversion to other standard 
measurements. 
 Measurements are also the basis for the calculation of condition amounts in lease rentals.

 Maintain  Number Range Intervals for Business Entity 
 Here, we considered only one business entity, which encompasses the whole department store. 
 However, you can specify how the number assignment is handled for this object. The specification 
applies uniformly for the company code. Note that the system only takes the setting for interval “01” into 
account (Figure  10-18 ). 
 In any internal number assignment, the system counts upward sequentially from the number shown in 
the Number field. For buildings, properties, and rental objects, the system assigns the number per business 
entity when an internal number assignment is used. This number is unique within the company code. The next 
assigned number for these objects is therefore not identical to the number that is shown here in Customizing.

checks if all rental objects for the contract have the correct contract type. If they do not, the system normally 
issues a message as a warning. 
 If you use different contract types for leasing commercial objects than you do for leasing apartments, 
then you should assign these usage types to the contract types accordingly.

 Define  Condition Types 
 In this section, you will specify condition types for your real estate contracts (Figure  10-38 and Figure  10-39 ). 
Condition types are the most visible component of lease accounting to the user. The selection of a condition 
type on the real estate contract drives the account assignment and the accounting treatment in the case of 
FAS13 straight-lining. Condition types are assigned to condition groups, which are assigned to contract types.   
 It is recommended that the condition type name indicates what kind of process it will be used for—
payable or receivable. Since condition types are assigned to contract types via condition groups, the 
distinction is not mandatory, but it may aid the user in reporting and analysis. 
 This relationship ensures that only condition types that are applicable for a contract type are available 
for use by the user.

 Conditions are assigned to condition groups, which are assigned to contract types (Figure  10-40 ). This 
assignment helps simplify the selection of conditions when creating a contract. In this step you will define 
condition groups and assign condition types to them, which are as follows:
• 
 Per contract type (customer, vendor, and so on) 
• 
 Per usage type of the rental object (commercial, residential, and so on) 
 Condition groups are mandatory. The only conditions available in the contract or rental object are 
those that you have assigned to the given condition group for that contract or object.

 In this step, you will define flow types (Figure  10-44 ). This is a prerequisite for creating condition types and 
for account determination. Flow types classify flows in the following:
• 
 Cash flow 
• 
 Accounting  
 The conditions are assigned to flow types, which are tied to the account determination. Flow types 
specify how conditions will be treated within the cash flow and account determination. It is through the flow 
type that a condition is specified as either a debit or a credit posting. Accrual and deferral types may also be 
defined at this point.

 For some transactions, it is not possible to post using the flow type originally assigned (that is derived 
from the condition type). For these transactions, you have to assign a reference flow type. You make this 
assignment using a relationship key in the Assign Reference Flow Types IMG activity in the next section.

 Assign Reference Flow Types 
 In this step, you will assign reference flow types to flow types (Figure  10-45 ).  
 With certain business transactions, postings cannot be made using the flow type that was originally 
assigned (the flow type derived from the condition type). For such transactions, reference flow types must 
be assigned. You will create these assignments in this activity using a relationship key. As an example, if 
a condition was increased after the periodic processing run, a follow-up posting is required to post the

incremental condition increase. In this case, a reference flow type 10—“Follow-Up Posting Due to Condition 
Increase”—is used to record the entry. If the condition was decreased after the periodic processing run, a 
follow-up posting is also required to post the incremental condition decrease. In this case, a reference flow 
type 20—“Follow-Up Posting Due to Condition Decrease”—is used to record the entry. The flexibility of 
using different flow types allows for posting adjustments to different GL accounts if required. 
 The periodic processing program also generates the transfer postings. The transfer posting reverses 
the posting on the contract and posts the transaction amount to the building/property real estate object. A 
reference flow type of 30—“Distribution Transfer Posting”—is also assigned to a flow type.

 Assign Flow Types to Condition Types 
 You can assign defined flow types to the condition  type (Figure  10-46 ). Assign the flow types that you want 
to be used for the periodic posting for external contracts. The system derives all other flow types from the 
reference flow types.

 Accounting in REFX 
 We need to carry out the following activities to configure  accounting in the SAP REFX system. 
 Define Tax Types 
 In this activity you will enter the necessary tax types (Figure  10-47 ). Specifying tax types is mandatory. Tax 
types are country dependent. You can define multiple tax types for each country.

 Create Tax  Groups 
 Specifying tax groups is mandatory. The tax group determines the tax rate for a transaction. The tax group, 
together with the country, the tax type, and possibly the region, determines the tax percentage rate. 
 The following tax groups, as shown in Table  10-2  and Figure  10-48 , have been defined.

 Assign  Tax Codes 
 In this step, you will assign a tax code in your accounting system to the tax types and tax groups that you 
defined in Flexible Real Estate Management (Figure  10-53 ). You define tax codes in Customizing for your 
accounting system.  
 The tax code is needed for calculating service tax. The tax code assignment is both country dependent 
and time dependent. The tax code is needed for calculating tax on sales and purchases.

 Define  Posting Activities 
 Using the one-time postings function, you can post documents in Financial Accounting (FI) with reference 
to data in Flexible Real Estate Management (REFX; Figure  10-55  and Figure  10-56 ). 
 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE FOR CONFIGURING AND IMPLEMENTING SAP REFX  
210
 The data entry screens for one-time postings are considerably simplified, as compared to the normal FI 
interface, and better adapted to the needs of real estate management. 
 You first enter the posting activity and the company code. Based on the settings made in Customizing 
for posting activities, the system constructs one or more documents that you can then add to (for example, 
by entering the invoice amount or the concrete real estate object). 
 Based on the customization settings you make for the posting activity, the system determines the 
following (among other information):
• 
 How many documents are to be posted 
• 
 How many items the documents being posted have 
• 
 Default data for the document header and the line items (especially account 
symbols, bank details, account assignment objects, and percentage of total amount) 
• 
 If and how distribution should be made to objects of the contract

 Maintain Number Range for  Rent Invoice 
 Here, you will specify the number range interval to be used for the invoice number. 
 Define at least one number range interval for each company code (Figure  10-57 ) in which invoices are 
printed, and for each fiscal year for which you want to print invoices (Figure  10-58 ). If this interval already 
has the number “01”, you do not need to create any number range settings in the IMG activity Company 
Code-Dependent Settings for Invoice. 
 Choose “Internal Number Assignment” for all intervals.

 Correspondence in REFX 
 We need to carry out following activities to configure  correspondence   in the SAP REFX system. 
 Define Forms 
 In this activity, you will specify the forms you want to use for correspondence activities (Figure  10-59 ). 
 Define the forms you need and assign a form object to them (PDF-based form or smart form). We 
usually use smart forms for generating output forms.

 Dunning 
 Dunning is a process that enables reminder communications to be sent to customers or vendors for 
outstanding invoices, requesting a payment to be made. Dunning programs are set for both accounts 
receivable and accounts payable. The dunning procedure for the contract is based on the dunning program 
of the Financial Accounting module, but we can use it by creating real estate–specific settings in Flexible 
Real Estate Management. 
     Define Dunning Groupings 
 Dunning notices are generally created per business partner, but we can create a group of open items and 
dun this group to send notices covering the entire group. We can send a separate dunning notice for each 
rental object to the business partner by defining a grouping key, which is a two-character, alphanumeric key, 
with the contract number field. 
 Dunning  Areas 
 Dunning area  means the client or company code or sales organization or business area in which we 
are working on the dunning program (Figure  10-61 ). Dunning areas are used when more than one 
organizational unit in a company code is responsible for dunning. We have the option of dunning it at the 
organization level, like the sales organization, or business area and may not be necessarily be running it at 
the company-code level. We can specify all dunning areas that we want to consider in REFX. However, the 
use of a dunning area is optional.

 Assign Application/Role Category/Dunning  Parameter 
 In this activity, we will specify which additional business partners should be sent dunning notices. We can 
assign a role category to an application category of a business partner, and we can mention if the role is the 
dunning recipient, alternative dunning recipient, or not a dunning recipient. 
 As required, complete and review the following fields, as shown in Table  10-3  and Figure  10-62 .  
 Determine Dunnable  Payment Methods 
 We have to determine which incoming payment methods can be dunned and define any payment methods as 
dunnable if we want them to be dunned in Flexible Real Estate Management (Figure  10-63 and Figure  10-64 ).
