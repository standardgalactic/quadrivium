Preface
If a birth date could be assigned to the science of thermodynamics,it would certainly
be the day of publication of the Clausius article on the ﬁrst and second law of
thermodynamics, occurred in 1850. Independently, these two laws were also laid
by Kelvin. Both authors arrived at the two fundamental laws of thermodynamics
relying on the ideas of Carnot on the operation of heat engines and on the
work of Mayer and Joule on the mechanical equivalent of heat. Subsequently,
the thermodynamic theory received contributions from other authors including
Maxwell and Helmholtz. We point out the fundamental contribution of Gibbs whose
formulation of the thermodynamics on the basis of the convexity properties of the
thermodynamic potentials is that we follow in this book starting from Chap.3.
By its origin thermodynamics is closely related to the study of heat engines and
thermodynamic processes. However, the science of thermodynamics should also be
understood as the study of thermodynamic properties of substances. In this book,
we adopt the point of view according to which thermodynamics is concerned with
the study of macroscopic properties obtained from macroscopic laws. This does not
mean that the laws of thermodynamics can not be obtained from microscopic laws.
We just understand that this task belongs to the domain of another discipline, the
statistical mechanics.
In the ﬁrst two chapters of this book we use the thermodynamic processes
to introduce the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, which we call Joule principle,
and the ﬁrst part of the second law of thermodynamics, which we call Carnot
principle, which allows us to deﬁne the absolute temperature and entropy. In
Chap. 3 we present the principle of maximum entropy as introduced by Gibbs,
which corresponds to the second part of the second law of thermodynamics. This
principle leads to the convexity of thermodynamic potentials, studied in Chap. 4
along with the Legendre transformations. Chapter 5 is reserved for the analysis of
the consistency of equations of state and Maxwell relations. The Nernst-Planck
principle, which is the third law of thermodynamics, is presented in Chap. 6.
This book treats not only the fundamental principles of thermodynamics but
also the thermodynamics of phase transitions and critical phenomena observed in
various types of systems. Initially, we study the transitions between ordinary phases,

Preface
solid, liquid and vapor, in pure substances and in binary mixtures. We then examine
the transitions of the order-disorder type in binary alloys and then pass to the
study of phase transitions in magnetic systems, that include the ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic materials, and in dielectrics.
The chapter on the Gibbs phase rule and the structure of the phase diagrams of
multicomponent systems is based on the work of Grifﬁths and Wheeler. The study
of criticality is done in accordance with the view that the systems have universal
behavior in the critical region and can be described by the scaling theory introduced
by Widom. In the study of phase transitions and criticality we use equations of
state that are introduced ad hoc and whose most notorious example is the van
der Waals equation. Such equations, in spite of being different, describe the same
critical behavior if they have the same symmetries. This universal behavior can be
understood by the Landau theory of phase transitions, also described in this book.
Other topics studied in this book include the thermodynamics of solids, liquid
crystals, thermal radiation and thermochemistry. We examine the structural phase
transitions and the phase transitions occurring between the mesofases of liquid
crystals. In the study of thermal radiation we arrive at the Planck distribution by
a thermodynamic reasoning. The last chapter concerns the equilibrium thermody-
namics of chemical reactions.

Introduction
1.1.1
Thermal Phenomena
The thermal phenomena are events that occur around us every day and so are part of
our common experience. We feel the changes in temperature throughout the day
and perceive climate changes caused by variations in atmospheric pressure and
temperature. We notice that the ﬁre is the most striking manifestation of the daily
thermal processes. We learn that it can be used to heat water and make it boil and
discover its enormous potentiality to generate motion and useful work.
In the absence of ﬁre, the scalding water cools spontaneously to room temper-
ature. In this process of spontaneous cooling, we ﬁnd that the energy dissipates
irreversibly in the form of heat transferred to the environment. However, it is
possible to avoid the dissipation if the heat generated by ﬁre or by other means
is used to obtain useful work. In fact, this is achieved by means of a heat engine
which transforms part of the heat into work that can be used directly or converted
into another form of energy.
We also notice that a body does not cool spontaneously, unless it is placed in
contact with a colder body. On contact, the hotter body cools because it gives off
heat spontaneously to the colder body. However, it is possible to cool a body in the
absence of a colder one. In fact, this can be achieved by the refrigerator, which does
the opposite of the spontaneous process, that is, it removes heat from a colder body
by the consumption of work and gives heat to the warmer body.
The operation principles of heat engines and refrigerators are directly related to
the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, which are laws that govern how the heat
is transformed into work and vice versa. These fundamental laws also govern the
thermal behavior of bodies such as the thermal expansion, the decrease in volume
by compression, the increase in temperature by heat absorption, etc.
In general, the bodies expand when heated, as happens to a stem of iron or to
mercury inside a thermometer. Some materials, by contrast, contract when heated,

as happens to rubber. We mention also the peculiar behavior of water when heated,
which expands if it is above four degrees Celsius and contracts if it is below this
temperature. The bodies also contract by the increase of the pressure exerted on
them. Some bodies can be compressed more easily than others. In general, the gases
have large variations in volume when compressed, contrary to what happens with
the liquids and solids which have a small decrease in volume.
The amount of heat that the bodies can receive is a fundamental thermodynamic
property. Some bodies can receive a large amount of heat with a small increase
in temperature. The variation in temperature can also be zero, as in a system
comprising two or more thermodynamic phases in coexistence. A trivial example
is the system formed by water in coexistence with ice. If this system receives heat,
a certain amount of ice will melt becoming liquid, but the temperature remains
unchanged.
1.1.2
Viewpoint
We adopt the point of view according to which the science of thermodynamics
concerns the study of the macroscopic properties of the bodies from macroscopic
fundamental laws. This does not mean that the laws of thermodynamics can not
be obtained from the laws governing the microscopic motion of matter. We just
understand that this task is beyond the scope of thermodynamics and belongs to the
ﬁeld of statistical mechanics.
According to our point of view, the thermodynamic laws and properties do
without reference to the microscopic constitution of matter. However, they acquire
greater understanding if we can resort on the atomic constitution of matter. After
all, the big breakthrough in the study of thermal phenomena, which gave rise to the
science of thermodynamics, was due to the understanding of heat as the agitation of
matter at the microscopic level.
In this and in the following chapters, we will consider mechanical systems,
involving only heat and mechanical working, comprising the isotropic ﬂuids, which
can be either a gas or an isotropic liquid. In other chapters we will examine other
thermodynamic systems involving heat and other types of work.
1.1.3
Thermodynamic Equilibrium
In this book we study systems that are in thermodynamic equilibrium. The states of
thermodynamic equilibrium are described by a small number of physical quantities
and do not depend on the way they are reached. The thermodynamic properties
that are functions of the equilibrium state do not therefore depend on how the
equilibrium is reached. The existence of equilibrium states is a fundamental
postulate of thermodynamics.

1.1
Introduction
3
The thermodynamic equilibrium of a system comprises the thermal equilibrium
and other forms of equilibrium, depending on the type of thermodynamic system
under study. A mechanical system in thermodynamic equilibrium is in thermal
equilibrium and in mechanical equilibrium.
When a hot body is placed in contact with a cold body, a ﬂow of heat establishes
from the ﬁrst to the second up to the moment when they reach a situation in which
the ﬂow ceases. From that moment on the two bodies are in thermal equilibrium. The
thermal equilibrium can be checked by measuring the temperature of the bodies. If
the two bodies have the same temperatures then they are in thermal equilibrium.
If several bodies are in thermal contact with each other, they will be in thermal
equilibrium if they have the same temperature.
We should also consider the internal thermal equilibrium of a thermodynamic
system. In this case it is useful to understand the system as consisting of several parts
that make up a set of multiple bodies in contact. The internal equilibrium means that
there is no heat ﬂows between the various parts of the system so that they all must
have the same temperature. In summary, all parts of a system in thermal equilibrium
have the same temperature.
If the object of study is a mechanical system, the thermodynamic equilibrium
will also comprise mechanical equilibrium. For example, two gases in a closed
vessel and separated by a movable wall will be in mechanical equilibrium if the
wall is at rest. In this situation, the pressure is the same on both sides of the wall.
Generally speaking, the mechanical equilibrium of a ﬂuid, in the absence of external
forces, requires no pressure gradient inside the ﬂuid. Thus all parts of a system in
mechanical equilibrium have the same pressure, in the absence of external forces.
1.1.4
Thermodynamic Process
The thermodynamic state of a gas can be changed in several ways depending on the
type of wall which delimits the container which encloses the gas. If the walls are
rigid but allow heat exchange, diathermal walls, the state of the gas can be changed
simply by contact of the container, for example, with a warmer body. In this case, the
gas receives heat and the pressure increases while the volume remains unchanged.
If on the other hand, the walls of the container do not allow the exchange of heat,
adiabatic walls, but are mobile, the state may be modiﬁed by movements of the
walls. A compression decreases the volume of the gas increasing its pressure. If the
walls are rigid and adiabatic, then the gas is completely isolated from the outside
and its equilibrium state remains unchanged.
If a system has its thermodynamic state modiﬁed, we say that it undergoes
a thermodynamic process. In the study of equilibrium thermodynamics we are
particularly interested in processes whose initial and ﬁnal states are thermodynamic
equilibrium states. The intermediate states can not be all equilibrium states because
it is necessary to remove the system from its initial equilibrium state for the process
to take place. It is possible that all intermediate states are states out of equilibrium,
as happens with the free expansion of a gas, which can be performed as follows.

Joule Principle
In a container with two compartments, a gas occupies one of the two compartments
while the other is empty. At a certain moment the wall separating the compartments
is removed, the gas expands freely and after a certain time the equilibrium is restored
in a state in which the gas ﬁlls all the container.
We can also imagine that the ﬁnal state of equilibrium is reached by a ther-
modynamic process consisting of a succession of equilibrium states, intercalated
between the initial and ﬁnal states. To this end, small perturbations are applied
in the system at regular intervals of time. The interval between two disturbances
must be large enough to enable the system to relax to a new equilibrium state
before it will be disturbed again. Now if we imagine that the disturbance is too
small then the equilibrium state occurring after each disturbance will be very close
to the disturbed state so that the time interval between two disturbance may be
reduced. In the limit where the disturbances are arbitrarily small and inﬁnitely large
in number, the successive equilibrium states form a continuum that deﬁnes a quasi-
static thermodynamic process. Like the equilibrium state, the quasi-static processes
play a major role in equilibrium thermodynamics.
1.2
Work
1.2.1
Representation of Quasi-static Processes
Consider a quantity of gas conﬁned in a container. Moving the container walls,
we can adjust the volume V of the gas at will. Introducing or removing heat, we
can vary the gas pressure p until it reaches the value we wish. Once the gas is in
its equilibrium state it is characterized by the volume V and the pressure p and
therefore may be represented by a point in pressure versus volume diagram, called
Clapeyron diagram.
Imagine that the gas undergoes a quasi-static process that takes it from an initial
equilibrium state A to a ﬁnal equilibrium state B. These two states are represented
by two points in the Clapeyron diagram. The intermediate stages of the process are
also states of equilibrium, and therefore have a Clapeyron diagram representation.
Thus, the quasi-static process corresponds to a succession of points in the Clapeyron
diagram, forming a continuous path that connects the points A and B, as can be seen
in Fig. 1.1.
Notice that out of equilibrium processes, that is, such that the gas is not in
equilibrium, do not have representation in the Clapeyron diagram. Suppose, for
example, that a gas undergoes a free expansion. Before the expansion, the gas is in
equilibrium and its state is represented by a point in the Clapeyron diagram. After
the expansion and as soon it enters again in equilibrium, the state of the gas will
be represented by another point which is distinct from the ﬁrst. However, these two
points are not connected by a trajectory because the free expansion, a process that
is out of equilibrium, has no representation in the Clapeyron diagram, although the
initial and ﬁnal states have it.

1.2.2
Isochoric and Isobaric Processes
The simplest quasi-static process that can be carried out is the one in which the
volume of the gas remains unchanged, called isochoric process. The corresponding
trajectory is an isochoric line, which in the Clapeyron diagram is simply a straight
line parallel to the p-axis. Introducing heat into the gas slowly while the walls of
the container are kept unchanged, we will be facing an isochoric process.
The quasi-static process in which the pressure remains unchanged is called
isobaric process. The corresponding trajectory is an isobaric line or isobar, which
in the Clapeyron diagram is merely a straight line parallel to the V -axis. Let us
imagine that the gas is conﬁned in a cylindrical container having rigid base and side
walls and whose top can move freely. Over the top there is a block and the system
composed by the block, the container, and the gas are in mechanical equilibrium.
Suppose that from a certain instant the gas becomes subjected to a continuous ﬂow
of heat, for example, through the base of the container. Suppose further that the heat
transfer is slow enough so that the system can be considered to be in mechanical
equilibrium at each instant. Due to the continuous ﬂow of heat, the gas expands and
the block rises. Since the block has a ﬁxed weight, the gas pressure remains constant
throughout the expansion and we are faced with an isobaric process.
1.2.3
Mechanical Work
Consider the isobaric process just described. If we denote by A the area of the top,
then the force exerted by the gas on the block is F D pA. If the top rises from the
height `1 to the height `2 then the work W done by the gas in the isobaric process
will be W D F.`2  `1/ D pA.`2  `1/, that is,
W D p.V2  V1/;

where V1 D A`1 is the initial volume and V2 D A`2 is the ﬁnal volume. The work
done by the gas is represented in the Clapeyron diagram by the area under the line
segment that represents the isobaric process.
Let us imagine next an arbitrary quasi-static process connecting the states A and
B, like the one shown in Fig. 1.1. This process can be accomplished by conveniently
changing the mass of the block which rests on the top of the container as well as the
heat ﬂow. The process is then approximated by a succession of isobaric subprocesses
such that the volume change in each one of them is V . Denoting by pi the pressure
corresponding to the starting point of each subprocess, then the work done is given
by the sum of the works corresponding to each isobaric subprocess,

The area under the path is equal to the work performed by the gas. When a gas
does work, increasing its volume, W is positive because the pressure of the gas is
positive. When a gas consumes work, reducing its volume, W is negative. Note that
in an isochoric process, the work done by the gas is zero.
As an example of the calculation of work, suppose that a gas undergoes a process
such that its pressure is inversely proportional to the volume, that is,

In the International System of Units, the volume is measured in m3 and the
pressure in pascal (Pa), deﬁned as one newton per square meter. Another very
common unit for pressure, but not belonging to the International Unit System is
the atmosphere (atm), deﬁned as 101,325Pa. The unit of work in the International
Unit System is the joule (J), deﬁned as one newton-meter.

Heat
1.3.1
Measure of Heat
By putting a body in contact with a warmer body, there will be heat transfer from
the second to the ﬁrst. However, in this procedure we will not know how much heat
is transferred from one body to the other. To transfer a determined amount of heat
to a system we proceed as in the following example.
A system comprising a ﬂuid conﬁned in a container with adiabatic walls has in its
interior a propeller shaft which is wounded by an inextensible wire. This wire passes
through a small pulley and is attached at its end to a block of mass m. Initially,
the block is at rest and propeller immobile. Then the block is released and falls
slowly with a constant speed v due to friction of the helix with the ﬂuid. As the
speed is constant the power dissipated by the helix is equal to the work performed
by the force of gravity per unit time mgv, where g is the acceleration of gravity.
In a time interval t the ﬂuid receives an amount of heat Q D mgvt. Such a
procedure in which a measurable amount of heat is introduced into a system we call
Joule procedure.
Another way of performing the Joule procedure is to put within the system a
resistor connected to a battery. If the circuit is closed during a time interval t, the
heat received by the system equals Q D .E2=R/t, where R is the resistance of
the resistor and E is the battery emf.
If a system is brought from a state A to a state B, through an arbitrary quasi-static
process in which it receives heat, the Joule procedure allows the direct determination
of the amount of heat received by the system. If on the other hand, the system
experiences a quasi-static process from a state C to a state D, where it yields heat,
the Joule procedure can not be applied directly because this procedure can only be
used to transfer heat to the system. We note, however, that in the inverse process
the system receives heat and this heat can be measured by the Joule procedure. The
amount of heat given off by the system in direct process CD is the same amount of
heat received in the reverse process DC.

8
1
Joule Principle
Conventionally, the heat received by the system under consideration is positive
and the heat given off by the system is negative. Denoting by QAB the heat
exchanged in the process AB, then according to this convention QAB > 0. Similarly,
QCD < 0, QDC > 0 and also QCD D QDC.
1.3.2
Calorie
The heat has the same unit as work. In the International System of Units both
quantities are measured in joule (J). Another unit often used for heat, but not
belonging to the International System of Units, is the calorie (cal) deﬁned as the
amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree
Celsius. This deﬁnition is directly related to the deﬁnition of speciﬁc heat. However,
the speciﬁc heat of water is not constant but varies with temperature, which makes
the deﬁnition of calorie inaccurate unless one declares what temperature is taken
as reference. Thus, many calories may be deﬁned such as the thermochemical
calorie, equivalent to 4.184 J; the IT calorie, equivalent to 4.1868J; the average
calorie, equivalent to 4.1900 J; the 15 ıC calorie, equivalent to 4.1858J, and the
20 ıC calorie, equivalent to 4.1819J.
The origin of the calorie as a unit of heat occurred before the development of
thermodynamics, when the heat measurements were not related to the measures
of work. The most common method to measure the heat developed in a process
is to compare it with that necessary to raise the temperature by one unit a certain
quantity of water. Another method for measuring heat is the one used by Lavoisier
and Laplace in which the heat developed by a system is determined by the amount
of ice that the heat can melt. It is worth mentioning that the ﬁrst method is linked to
the speciﬁc heat of water and the second to the latent heat of melting ice.
The ﬁrst values for calorie are found in the Joule experiments for determining
the mechanical equivalent of heat, that is, the work required to raise the temperature
of a unit a mass of water by one unit of temperature. Joule showed that the heat
required to raise by one degree Fahrenheit the temperature of one pound of water is
equivalent to the work of a body of 772 pounds falling from a height of one foot. In
the International System of Units this is equal to 4.16 J. This value obtained by Joule
for the mechanical equivalent of heat, and therefore for the calorie, is very close to
the current values of the calorie. Before Joule the mechanical equivalent of heat was
obtained by Mayer. According to Mayer, the heating of a certain a quantity of water
by 1 ıC corresponds to the falling of the same amount of water from a height of
365 m. This result is equivalent to 3.58 J.
1.3.3
Quasi-static Adiabatic Process
Consider a gas conﬁned to a cylindrical vessel with adiabatic walls, so that no heat
can be exchanged between the environment and the system. Then imagine that the

1.4
Conservation of Energy
9
vessel top is raised slowly, leading to a gas expansion. This can be done by assuming
that the top initially contains a certain amount of sand. The sand is then slowly
removed, so that the process is quasi-static. The gas then undergoes a quasi-static
process where no heat is exchanged with the environment, that is, a quasi-static
adiabatic process. The corresponding trajectory is an adiabatic line.
1.4
Conservation of Energy
1.4.1
Internal Energy
To deﬁne the internal energy of a gas, we use as a reference one point in the
Clapeyron diagram, labeling it by O D .V0; p0/, and associate arbitrarily to this
point an energy U0. To determine the energy UA of an arbitrary point A D .VA; pA/,
we choose a process consisting of an adiabatic line followed by an isochoric process,
as shown in Fig. 1.2. An adiabatic line connects the point O to an intermediate point
B D .VB; pB/ while an isochoric line connects the point B to the point ﬁnal A. If
we denote by W0B the work done by the gas in the adiabatic process and by QBA the
heat received by the gas in the isochoric process, then the energy UA is deﬁned by
UA D U0  W0B C QBA;
(1.9)
in which the work is determined by the formula (1.3) while the heat is measured
by the Joule procedure. It may happen, however, that QBA is negative, resulting in
the inability to use the Joule procedure. In this case, we use the inverse process and
determine UA by
U0 D UA  WB0 C QAB;
(1.10)
since QAB D QBA > 0. Since any two states can be connected by an adiabatic
line followed by an isochoric line, then the internal energy of gas is deﬁned for any
state.
1.4.2
The Principle of Conservation of Energy
Suppose we choose another path to reach the point A from the point O. For example,
the path OCA, shown in Fig. 1.2, comprising an isochoric line followed by an
adiabatic line. In this case, the work and heat are different from the previous case.
However, the Joule principle, or principle of conservation of energy states that the
energy of an equilibrium state is independent of the process used to reach it. Thus
the energy of the point A is the same regardless of the path used to reach the point
A from the reference point O. We may write then, for any path,
UA D U0 C Q  W;

second comprises an
isochoric line (OC) followed
by an adiabatic line (CA)
where Q is the heat exchanged and W is the work done by the system along the
chosen path.
Consider now any two points A and B. The energy difference U D UB  UA
between these two points will then be
U D Q  W;
(1.12)
where Q is the heat exchanged and W is the work done by the system along any
path between any A and B. Remember that heat exchanged is positive when the
system receives heat and negative when the systems gives off heat; the work actually
performed by the system is positive while the work consumed is negative.
1.4.3
First Law of Thermodynamics
The Joule principle, or principle of conservation of energy, is the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics. It was established by several scientists, but mostly by Mayer
and Joule, who assumed that the various forms of work could be converted into
one another and, moreover, that all of them could be dissipated as heat. Although
it seems quite obvious that the work can be transformed into heat, for example,
by friction, one can not conclude that the work dissipated always produce the
same amount of heat. It is necessary to experimentally verify such a law, which
is summarized in the determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat. This
determination was in fact performed by Mayer and exhaustively by Joule by
numerous experiments. By assuming that a certain amount of work always turns
into the same amount of heat, they were adopting the conservation of energy.
From the microscopic point of view, the principle of conservation of energy was
advanced by Helmholtz. Assuming the atomic constitution of matter, Helmholtz
extended the theorem of conservation of mechanical energy to the microscopic
motion of atoms. That is, he assumed that the sum of the kinetic and potential energy
of atoms is constant and is therefore the internal energy of a body. When any form

Problems
11
of work dissipates as heat, this means to say, from the microscopic point of view,
that atoms gain energy. Therefore, according to Helmholtz and other scientists that
have established the kinetic theory of matter, heat is associated to the microscopic
motion of atoms.

heat between them. After a while, the temperature becomes equal and the heat ﬂow
ceases. From that moment on the bodies are in thermal equilibrium.
Once a body is in thermal equilibrium its temperature does not change anymore,
unless it is disturbed. To verify possible changes in temperature, we used a tool
comprising a substance having a thermometric property, that is, a property which
varies with temperature. We call this instrument thermoscope and not thermometer,
considering that we did not introduce a temperature scale yet.
Consider a gas conﬁned in a cylindrical container whose base allows the
exchange of heat and whose top can move freely. Over the top we place a certain
amount of sand. Starting from a certain pressure adjusted by the quantity of sand
on the top, we lead the gas through a process along which the temperature remains
constant by monitoring the temperature of the gas by means of the thermoscope.
We place the gas in the initial state and mark the value of the thermometric
property. Then we allow the gas to expand by introducing a small amount of heat.
If the temperature has changed, we vary the pressure by the removal of sand,
until the temperature returns to the same value. This operation is then repeated
many times. If the amount of heat introduced into each stage is small enough, the
procedure approaches a quasi-static process carried out at constant temperature, or
an isothermal process. The corresponding trajectory is an isotherm.
Another way to achieve an isothermal process is as follows. It is an experimental
fact that can be veriﬁed by the use of thermoscope that a pure substance, such
as pure water, has its temperature unchanged while it boils at constant pressure.
If we place the cylinder containing the gas in contact with boiling water, the gas

temperature remains constant. Removing sand from the top in small quantities, we
will be conducting an isothermal process.
The above procedures allow a system to go through an isothermal process.
However, we do not know the temperature of the system since we have not deﬁned
a temperature scale. In the following we deﬁne a temperature scale, called absolute
temperature T , which allows us to determine the temperature of equilibrium
systems.
2.1.2
Carnot Cycle
Suppose that a system, comprising a ﬂuid contained in a vessel, runs a cycle
consisting of two isothermal processes and two adiabatic process. Starting from a
state A, the system undergoes an isothermal expansion to a state B, then an adiabatic
expansion to a state C, after an isothermal compression to a state D and ﬁnally an
adiabatic compression back to the initial state A. This cycle, shown in Fig. 2.1, is
referred to as the Carnot cycle. In the isothermal expansion, the system receives an
amount of heat Q1 from a heat reservoir at a temperature T1 and, in the isothermal
compression, gives off an amount of heat Q2 to a heat reservoir at temperature T2.
The Carnot principle states that the ratio of the work and heat received by a system
which operates according to a Carnot cycle depends only on the temperature of the
reservoirs. Denoting by W the work done by the Carnot cycle then W=Q1 depends
only on T1 and T2. This principle is universal and is therefore independent of the
substance that comprises the system that undergoes the cycle.
By the principle of conservation of energy, the work done in a closed cycle
equals the heat received minus the heat given off, W D Q1  jQ2j, so W=Q1 D
1  jQ2j=Q1. We conclude from the Carnot principle that the ratio of heat given off
jQ2j and the heat received Q1 depends only on the temperatures of the reservoirs,
that is
jQ2j
Q1
D f .T1; T2/:

If now we use another system which runs a Carnot cycle whose isotherms
correspond to temperatures T2 and T3 then
jQ3j
Q0

D f .T2; T3/;
(2.2)
where Q0
2 is the heat received and jQ3j is the heat given off by the system running
this second cycle. We conveniently choose the second cycle so that the heat given off
by the ﬁrst system is received by the second system so that Q0
2 D jQ2j. Multiplying
the two equations (2.1) and (2.2) and taking into account that Q0
2 D jQ2j, we get

(2.7)
where .T / is a function to be deﬁned but which is independent of the substances
which is used to run the cycle.
Next we use the Carnot principle, in the form given by equation (2.7), to deﬁne
the absolute scale of temperature. Following the prescription of Kelvin, we deﬁne
absolute temperature T as the quantity such that .T / / T or, equivalently,

Thus, to construct an absolute temperature scale, it sufﬁces to assign a numerical

in accordance with (2.8). For the Kelvin scale (K) one uses the triple point of water
as a reference state whose temperature we assign the exact value
T0 D 273:16 K:
(2.9)
It is worth mentioning that in the Kelvin scale the temperature of the melting of ice
at a pressure of 1 atm is Tsl D 273:15 K and that the temperature of boiling water at
the same pressure of 1 atm is Tlv D 373:15 K.
The Celsius scale (ıC) of temperature  is deﬁned by
 D T  273:15 ıC;
(2.10)
where T is given in kelvins. In the Celsius scale, the temperature of the triple point
of water is 0 D 0:01 ıC, whereas the temperature of the melting ice and boiling
water at the pressure of 1 atm are sl D 0 ıC and lv D 100 ıC, respectively.
2.2
Entropy
2.2.1
Deﬁnition of Entropy
The deﬁnition of temperature allowed us to determine the temperature of a gas for
any values of p and volume V . Thus, to each point of the Clapeyron diagram is
associated a temperature. The points having the same temperature form an isotherm.
The isotherms are a set of lines that never intersect, as can be seen in Fig. 2.2.
We can also plot on the same Clapeyron diagram, adiabatic lines corresponding
to the same gas. To set up an adiabatic line, we conﬁne the gas in a cylindrical
container with adiabatic walls and slowly raise the top of the cylinder, while
measuring the volume and pressure. Repeating this procedure several times, we get
several adiabatic lines. The adiabatic lines form a set of lines which do not intersect,
as can be seen in Fig. 2.2.
Just as there is a thermodynamic quantity associated with the isotherms, which
is the temperature, already deﬁned, we also associate to the adiabatic lines a
thermodynamic quantity. This quantity should be invariant along an adiabatic line,
but this is not sufﬁcient to establish its value for each adiabatic line. To set this
quantity, called entropy, we proceed as follows.
Consider any two adiabatic lines constructed in the manner shown above.
Consider a point A on the ﬁrst adiabatic line and a point B on the second adiabatic
line such that A and B are in the same isotherm, corresponding to a temperature T1,
as shown in Fig. 2.2. If SA is the entropy of the ﬁrst adiabatic line, then the entropy
SB of the second adiabatic line is deﬁned by

AB and CD are isotherms
corresponding to
temperatures T1 and T2,
respectively. The lines AC
and BD are adiabatic lines
where Q1 is the amount of heat received by the system from A to B along the
isotherm T1.
Suppose that another pair of points C and D are chosen on the two adiabatic lines,
C over the ﬁrst adiabatic and D over the second, but belonging to another isotherm,
corresponding to a temperature T2, as shown in Fig. 2.2. Using the same deﬁnition
we also have
SB D SA C Q2
T2
;
(2.12)
where Q2 is the amount of heat received by the system from C to D along the
isotherm T2. At ﬁrst sight, expressions (2.11) and (2.12) seem to be inconsistent.
But by the Carnot principle Q1=T1 D Q2=T2 so that (2.11) and (2.12) are in fact
consistent and the entropy of the second adiabatic line becomes independent of the
choice of the isotherms.
Thus, taking an adiabatic line as reference for entropy, all other adiabatic lines
will be associated with well deﬁned values of entropy. To each point of the
Clapeyron diagram is associated a certain value of entropy. As the adiabatic lines
connect points with the same entropy value, they are also called isentropic lines. The
quasi-static adiabatic processes may equivalently be called isentropic processes.
2.2.2
Clausius Integral
Next we show that the entropy difference between any two points A and B in the
Clapeyron diagram is given by the Clausius integral
SB  SA D
Z dQ
T ;
(2.13)
which extends over any path connecting the points A and B. This integral should
be understood as follows. A path chosen from A to B is partitioned into a number
of segments. For each segment, we determine the ratio Qi=Ti between the heat

18
2
Carnot Principle
exchanged and the temperature at which the system is found along the segment.
However, as the segment is not necessarily an isotherm, the temperature may vary
along the segment. To avoid ambiguity we set Ti as the temperature of the system
at the beginning of the segment. Thus, we calculate the sum
X
i
Qi
Ti
(2.14)
over all segments of the path. The integral in (2.13) should then be understood as
the limit of this sum when the number of segments grows without bound.
Let us demonstrate now that the sum in (2.14) is an approximation to the
difference in entropy SB  SA, while the number of sections is ﬁnite, but which
becomes exact in the limit as the number of segments becomes inﬁnite. To this
end, we chose a smooth and monotonic decreasing path. In the extreme points of
the segments, we draw adiabatic curves. We focus next in a segment between two
consecutive adiabatic lines as the one shown in Fig. 2.3. The initial and ﬁnal point of
the segment are I and F. The curves IG and HF are the two adiabatic lines and GH is
the isotherm built in such a way that the work WIGHF done by the system along the
path IGHF equals the work WIF along the path IF. Thus, the heat QIGHF received by
the system along the path IGHF equals the heat QIF received along the segment IF.
Indeed, from the energy difference between the states F and I,
UF  UI D QIF  WIF D QIGHF  WIGHF;
(2.15)
calculated along the paths IF and IGHF, we conclude that QIGHF D QIF because
WIF D WIGHF. But QIGHF D QGH, since IG and HF are adiabatic lines, so that
QGH D QIF:
(2.16)
From the deﬁnition of entropy, we see that the difference SF  SI between the
points F and I is given by
SF  SI D QGH
TG

(2.17)
where TG is the temperature corresponding to the isotherm GH. Therefore,

an isotherm built in such a
way that the works done by
the system along the paths
IGHF and IF are equal
where the summation is over all segments and the index i indicates that the
quantities refer to the i-th segment. By construction, the expression (2.19) is exact,
even for a ﬁnite number of segments. However, it cannot be identiﬁed with (2.14)
because T i
G and Ti are not equal, although Qi
IF D Qi. However, in the limit in which
the number of segments increase indeﬁnitely and the size of the segments decreases,
T i
G approaches T i
I D Ti, and the two summations become equal in this limit and
they are identiﬁed as the integral of expression (2.13).
2.2.3
Conservation of Energy in Differential Form
According to (2.18), the heat introduced along the segment IF is related to the
entropy difference between the extreme points by

where the summation is over all segments of the path. In the limit where the number

(2.22)
which extends along the path chosen between A and B. This equation says that the
heat exchanged along a process is identiﬁed with the area under the corresponding
trajectory in the T -S diagram.

2.3
Ideal Gas
2.3.1
Equation of State
All gases at sufﬁciently low densities behave similarly, irrespective of the type of
molecules that they are composed. This behavior is called the ideal behavior and the
gas is called an ideal gas. Therefore, an ideal gas must be understood as a shorthand
for a gas in the regime of low densities.
If the temperature is kept constant, the pressure of an ideal gas is inversely
proportional to the volume, that is,
p D A
V ;
(2.26)
which is the Boyle law. Experimentally, one ﬁnds that the constant A is proportional
to the temperature, which is the Gay-Lussac Law, so that we may write
p D BT
V :
(2.27)
The internal energy U of a gas which follows the law (2.27) is independent of the
volume, depending only on the temperature. This independence on the volume was
demonstrated experimentally by Joule by means of the free expansion of an ideal
gas. In many cases the energy is linear with temperature, so that
U D CT;
(2.28)

2.3
Ideal Gas
21
where we arbitrarily set U D 0 for T D 0. If another behavior of the internal
energy of an ideal gas is not explicitly stated, this means that we will be assuming
the behavior given by (2.28).
To demonstrate that U depends only on the temperature, we use the equation
(2.24) in the form
dS D 1
T dU C p
T dV:
(2.29)
Since S is a state function, then dS is an exact differential and, therefore,
@

:
(2.30)
The right hand side of this equation vanishes because p=T D B=V depends on
V but not on U . Therefore, 1=T does not depend on V but only on U or, in other
words, U depends on T but not on V .
Next, we examine the consequences of assuming that U depends only on
temperature. This is to say that the left side of the equation (2.30) vanishes.
Therefore, p=T depends only on V but not U . The equation of state (2.27) is
therefore compatible with this result although not the most general equation.
2.3.2
Avogadro Hypothesis
Consider two vessels with distinct volumes containing different amounts of the same
gas under the same temperature and pressure. Since the conditions are the same,
then the ratio between the numbers of molecules in the containers must be equal
to the ratio between the volumes. In other words, the number of molecules should
be proportional to the volume. Bearing in mind that, from equation (2.27), B is
proportional to the volume at T and p ﬁxed, we then conclude that B is proportional
to the number of molecules.
Using the standard for the number of molecules called mole, we may write
B D NR where N is the number of moles and R is the constant of proportionality.
Therefore, for the gas we are considering, the following equation holds
p D NRT
V
:
(2.31)
So far R is a constant which in principle should be different for each type of
ideal gas. However, the Avogadro hypothesis implies that the constant R must be
universal, that is, it must be the same for any gas at low densities. In fact, the
Avogadro hypothesis states that equal volumes of distinct ideal gases under the same
temperature and pressure contains the same number of molecules. This hypothesis
implies, for instance, that the ratio NT=pV should be the same for any ideal gas.

22
2
Carnot Principle
But according to equation (2.31), this ratio is a constant R, which therefore, must
be universal. It is called the universal gas constant and its value is
R D 8:314510 J=mol K:
(2.32)
Under normal conditions of temperature and pressure, that is, under the pressure of
1 atm (101;325Pa) and temperature of 0 ıC, 1 mole of gas occupies a volume equal
to 22:41410dm3.
An argument similar to that used above leads us to conclude that the constant C
that appears in equation (2.28) is also proportional to the number of moles, so that
U D NcT:
(2.33)
However, the constant c is not universal. For a monoatomic gas c D .3=2/R, for a
diatomic gas c D .5=2/R.
An alternative form of presenting the internal energy of ideal gases that obey
(2.33) is
U D c
RpV;
(2.34)
obtained form equations (2.31) and (2.33).
2.3.3
Adiabatic Curve
To determine the equation of an adiabatic curve, or isentropic line, in the Clapeyron
diagram, we ﬁrst calculate the differential dU from the equation (2.34),
dU D c
R.pdV C Vdp/:
(2.35)

Integrating this differential equation, we get

constant  varies from one gas to another. For a monatomic gas,  D 5=3 because
c D .3=2/R and for a diatomic gase,  D 7=5 because c D .5=2/R.
2.3.4
Entropy
To determine the entropy of an ideal gas corresponding to a point in the Clapeyron
diagram, we use the equation of state (2.31) to eliminate T in equation (2.37). Then
we obtain the following equation
dS D Nc. 
V dV C 1

Cyclic Processes
2.4.1
Heat Engines
Consider a system composed of a ﬂuid conﬁned in a cylindrical vessel and suppose
that initially it is a particular state. The ﬂuid undergoes a process and returns to its

24
2
Carnot Principle
initial state. Suppose that the cyclic process is such that it performs some positive
work, W > 0. In the Clapeyron diagram, this work corresponds to the area of the
internal region of the cycle. As the ﬂuid is back to the initial state, the change of
internal energy is zero so that the work equals the total heat Q. This total heat is
composed of the heat QR effectively received by the gas and the heat QC given
way by the gas, that is, Q D QR C QC. But QR > 0 and QC < 0, so that
Q D QR  jQCj. Therefore,
W D QR  jQCj:
(2.45)
Since W > 0, the heat received by the system is greater than the heat given away.
Therefore, in this case, we can say that part of the heat received by the system
becomes work and the other part is transferred to the outside. A heat engine works
in this way, converting heat into useful work.
Because not all the heat effectively received by the system becomes work, it is
important to know what fraction  of the heat received turns into work. This fraction
is called the efﬁciency of the heat engine and is deﬁned by
 D W
QR
;
(2.46)
or
 D QR  jQCj
QR
D 1  jQCj
QR
:
(2.47)
In general the efﬁciency is distinct for different cyclic processes and depends on the
substance which runs the cyclic process.
The simplest heat engine is that operating according to a Carnot cycle. As we
have seen, the Carnot cycle consists of four steps: (a) an isothermal expansion, at
a temperature T1, in which the system receives a heat Q1 > 0; (b) an adiabatic
expansion; (c) an isothermal compression, at a temperature T2, in which the system
yields a heat Q2 < 0; and (d) an adiabatic compression. The system returns to its
initial state, so that the work done W D Q1 C Q2 D Q1  jQ2j. The temperature
T1 is greater than T2. Thus, in this cycle, the system receives an amount of heat Q1
from a heat source at a higher temperature and gives off a smaller amount of heat to
a heat sink at a lower temperature.
According to the Carnot principle, the ratio jQ2j=Q1 D T2=T1 is independent of
the substance that undergoes the Carnot cycle. Therefore, the efﬁciency is
 D 1  T2

D T1  T2

which is independent of the substance and depends only on the temperatures of the

2.4.2
Otto Cycle
Let us examine a machine that operates with an ideal gas in a cycle called Otto
cycle. It consists of four processes: (a) an isochoric compression from A to B,
(b) an adiabatic expansion from B to C, (c) an isochoric decompression from C to D,
and (d) an adiabatic contraction from D to the starting point A. In the calculations
below we use the equation for the internal energy of an ideal gas in the form given
by equation (2.34).
In the ﬁrst process the gas receives an amount of heat QAB. As the gas does not
perform work, then the heat is equal to the change of internal energy, that is,
QAB D UB  UA D c
RpBVB  c
RpAVA:
(2.49)
In the second process the gas performs a work WBC. Because there is no heat
exchange, then the work is equal to the decrease in energy, that is,
WBC D UB  UC D c
RpBVB  c
RpCVC:
(2.50)
In the third process there is no work done, so that the heat in this process is given by
QCD D UD  UC D c

Finally, in the last process there is no heat exchanged so that the work is

Refrigerators
If we run a heat engine in the reverse sense, then we are creating a refrigerator.
For a better understanding, let us examine a Carnot cycle operated in the opposite
direction. We start from a state corresponding to a temperature T1. First we perform
an adiabatic expansion in which the system cools to a temperature T2 smaller than
T1. Then we go through an isothermal expansion at the temperature T2, the end of
which the system will have received a heat Q2 > 0. Then, the system is compressed
adiabatically to the temperature T1. Finally, it is compressed isothermally at the
temperature T1 to the starting point. In this last stage it gives way a heat Q1 < 0.
The total work W is negative, which means that the system actually consumes work.
As the total energy change is zero, then W D Q1 C Q2, which can be written as
jW j D jQ1j  Q2;
(2.58)
so that the heat given way is greater than the heat received. However, the important
point is that the system takes a certain amount of heat from a body at a lower
temperature and reject a greater amount of heat to a body at a higher temperature.
The purpose of the refrigerator is to remove as much heat as possible for a given
consumption of work. It is therefore convenient to deﬁne a performance coefﬁcient
! of the refrigerator by
! D Q2
jW j D
Q2
jQ1j  Q2
;
(2.59)
where Q2 is the heat extract from the colder body and W is the work consumed.
Notice that Q2 can be greater than jW j. Taking into account that for the Carnot
cycle jQ1j=Q2 D T1=T2 then the performance coefﬁcient for the cycle is
! D
T2
T1  T2
:
(2.60)
Paradoxically, a refrigerator may also function as a very efﬁcient heater because
the Q1 rejected to the body at the higher temperature may be very large. It is at least

Thermodynamic Coefﬁcients
3.1.1
Introduction
A system in thermodynamicequilibrium must be stable. This means to say that small
perturbations do not remove the system from its equilibrium. In a mechanical system
in stable equilibrium described by a potential energy V .x/, the stability implies
that the coefﬁcient d 2V =dx2 is non-negative. Similarly, a gas conﬁned in a vessel
with adiabatic walls, which can be viewed as a mechanical system, the mechanical
stability implies that the coefﬁcient @2U=@V 2 is nonnegative, where U.V / is the
internal energy and V the volume of the vessel. This quantity is directly related to
the adiabatic compressibility s, which will be deﬁned later, by @2U=@V 2 D 1=Vs.
Therefore, the mechanical stability of a gas means that the adiabatic compressibility
is nonnegative. The overall stability of a thermodynamic systems is related not
only to the adiabatic compressibility, but also to other coefﬁcients such as the
isothermal compressibility and the heat capacities at constant volume and at constant
pressure, as deﬁned below. A system in thermodynamic equilibrium implies that
these coefﬁcients are nonnegative. The positivity of the thermodynamic coefﬁcients,
however, does not necessarily imply global stability of thermodynamic systems. It
implies the local stability, that is, the stability with respect to small disturbances. The
global stability, which implies the local stability, of the thermodynamic systems is
guaranteed by the Clausius-Gibbs principle.
3.1.2
Heat Capacity
The heat capacity of a body is deﬁned as the ratio Q=T between the heat received
Q and the corresponding increase in temperature T . More precisely, as the limit
of this ratio when T ! 0. Because the amount of heat is small, then Q D TS,

above 4 ıC the density of water decreases with temperature and below 4 ıC the
density increases with temperature. At 4 ıC the water has its maximum density as
seen in Fig. 3.2.

Compressibility
The compressibility is related to the ratio between the decrease in the volume and

the compressibility. We have the bulk modulus at constant temperature BT D 1=T

Principle of Maximum Entropy
We focus our attention on two distinct states of an isolated system composed of
several bodies, which can be interpreted as the various parts of the same system. In
the ﬁrst state, the bodies are separated and each one is in thermodynamicequilibrium
at a given temperature and a given pressure. The separation between them is
imposed by the existence of one or more constraints of various types. A rigid wall,
for example, is a mechanical constraint. An adiabatic wall is a thermal constraint.
In this state, the system as a whole is in a state of constrained equilibrium. In the
second state, the constraints are absent, the bodies are in thermal and mechanical
contact with each other forming a system in an unconstrained equilibrium, all at the
same temperature and same pressure.
Next, we imagine a thermodynamic process that takes the system from a
state of constrained equilibrium to a state of unconstrained equilibrium, which is
accomplished simply by the withdrawal of the constraints, by placing the bodies in
thermal and mechanical contact. In this process, the energy and the volume remain
invariant. Under these conditions, the maximum entropy principle states that the
sum of the entropies of the body increases or remains constant. In other words, this
principle states that the entropy of the unconstrained equilibrium state is greater
than or equal to that of the constrained equilibrium, as long as the two states have
the same energy and the same volume.
Now we use the principle of maximum entropy to determine the conditions of
thermodynamic stability of a gas in contact with a thermal reservoir at temperature
T0 and a mechanical reservoir at a pressure p0. The gas is conﬁned in a vertical
cylindrical vessel having side walls that are rigid and adiabatic and whose base is in
contact with the thermal reservoir. This is an auxiliary system which exchanges
only heat without change in temperature. Because the temperature is constant,
the variation of its entropy SRT and the heat received QRT are related by
SRT D QRT=T0.
The top of the cylinder is adiabatic and can move freely. Over the top there
is a block which together with the surrounding air, act as a mechanical reservoir,
maintaining a constant pressure on the gas, no matter what the height of the top.
The pressure p0 on the gas is equal to the ratio between the weight of the block
and the area of top plus the pressure of the atmospheric air. Because the pressure
remains constant, the work WRM done by the mechanical reservoir and the variation
VRM of its volume are related by WRM D p0VRM.
Next, we consider the constrained and unconstrained equilibrium states. In the
ﬁrst, the gas is in equilibrium but isolated from the two reservoirs. In the second, the
gas is in contact with the two reservoirs forming a composite system in equilibrium.
In the state of constrained equilibrium we denote by T1 and p1 the temperature and
the pressure of the gas. We suppose that in this state its volume is V1, its energy

is U1 and its entropy is S1. The variation of the total entropy Stotal, between the
unconstrained and the constrained equilibrium, is given by
Stotal D S0  S1 C SRT D S0  S1 C QRT
T0
;
(3.14)
since the mechanical reservoir does not exchange heat. In addition, the variation of
the total energy Utotal between the two states is
Utotal D U0  U1 C QRT  WRM D U0  U1 C QRT C p0.V0  V1/;
(3.15)
since WRM D p0VRM and VRM D .V1  V0/.
If the composite system is brought from the constrained equilibrium to the
unconstrained equilibrium in such a way that the total energy is constant, then we
have Utotal D 0 and, according to the principle of maximum entropy, Stotal  0.
In other terms, for
U0  U1 C p0.V0  V1/ C QRT D 0;
(3.16)
we should have
S0  S1 C QRT
T0
 0:
(3.17)
Replacing QRT, obtained from equation (3.16), into equation (3.17), we arrive at the
principle o maximum entropy in the form
.S1  S0/  1

.U1  U0/  p0

.V1  V0/  0;
(3.18)
which we call Clausius-Gibbs principle, as illustrated in Fig. 3.3a for the case
V1 D V0.
3.2.2
Principle of Minimum Energy
Suppose again that the set of various bodies undergoes a thermodynamic process
that leads the set from the state of constrained equilibrium to the state of uncon-
strained equilibrium. However, the process that interests us here is the one in which
the total entropy is kept constant. For the occurrence of this situation, the total
energy can not remain invariant. In fact, according to the principle of minimum
energy, the total energy should decrease or remain the same. In other words, this
principle states that the energy of the state of unconstrained equilibrium is less than
or equal to that of the state of constrained equilibrium, as long as these states have
the same entropy and the same volume.

We consider again, the gas conﬁned in a cylinder vessel, initially separated from
the thermal and mechanical reservoirs. Then they are placed in contact and reach
equilibrium by a trajectory such that the total variation of entropy is zero. According
to the principle of minimum energy, the total energy should decrease or remain
constant. That is, for Stotal D 0 , we should have Utotal  0. In other words, for

(3.21)
as illustrated in Fig. 3.3b for the case V1 D V0.
Importantly, the inequalities (3.18) and (3.21) are equivalent, which means to
say that the principles of maximum entropy and minimum energy in the forms
given by these two inequalities are in fact two expressions of one and the same
principle, which we call the principle of Clausius-Gibbs. The equivalence of the
two inequalities for the case where the volume remains constant becomes evident
from the Fig. 3.3.

3.2.3
Thermal Stability
We interpret the inequalities (3.18) and (3.21) as the general stability conditions of
a thermodynamic system. To study speciﬁc stabilities, we consider special cases of
these inequalities. We imagine that a gas is taken from a reference state with energy
U , entropy S and volume V , and led to another state with energy U 0, entropy S0 and
volume V 0, through a particular thermodynamic process. Deﬁning U D U 0  U
as the change in energy, S D S0  S as the change in entropy and V D V 0  V
as the change in the volume, then the inequality (3.21) is written as
U C pV  TS  0;
(3.22)
where T and p are the temperature and pressure of the reference state.
Stabilities of various kinds can be examined depending on the type of disturbance
made on the system. First, we analyze the thermal stability, which corresponds to
the case in which the gas exchanges heat without performing work. That is, the gas
suffers an isochoric disturbance. In this case, V D 0, so that the inequality (3.22)
becomes
U  TS  0:

Isothermal Stability
Let us assume now that the disturbance is such that the temperature of the gas
remains constant and equal to T , that is, an isothermal disturbance. In this case, the
variation in the internal energy of the gas is U D QT  WT, where QT D TS
is the heat introduced isothermally and WT is the work done by the gas along an

In this case, the disturbance is such that the gas pressure remains the same, which
corresponds to an isobaric disturbance. The variation of internal energy of the gas

the gas and Qp is the heat introduced at constant pressure. For small values of heat

3.3.1
Statements and Meanings
The second law of thermodynamics is the law that distinguishes thermodynamics
from the other areas of physics. At the same time, it is a fundamental law of nature
that has implications that go beyond the ﬁeld of physics. Many are their statements
and their meanings. It was introduced independently by Clausius and Kelvin from
the ideas of Carnot on heat engines and cyclic processes. For this reason, the original
statements of this fundamental law refers to the operation of heat engines and cyclic
processes. The statement associated with the name of Kelvin says that no process
is possible whose sole result is the conversion of heat, extracted from a thermal
reservoir, into work. In other words, it is impossible to construct a heat engine that
converts all the heat received into work. The statement associated with the name
of Clausius states that no process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of
heat from a cooler to a hotter body. In other words, it is impossible to build a
refrigerator that operates without the consumption of work. The further development
of thermodynamic theory led to the Clausius deﬁnition of entropy as a state function
and the formulation of the second law as a principle of maximum entropy, which is
another form of representation of the second law.
The second law of thermodynamics must be understood as consisting of three
parts. The ﬁrst one leads to the deﬁnition of absolute temperature and entropy.
Combined with the principle of conservation of energy, it allows us to set up
the thermodynamic space and introduce the fundamental relation of systems in
equilibrium. The second part consists of the form postulated by Gibbs for the
principle of maximum entropy. It leads us to the property of convexity of the entropy
and the conditions of stability of thermodynamic systems in equilibrium. These two
parts refer only to equilibrium states and are represented by the Carnot principle and
by the Clausius-Gibbs principle, respectively. These two principles altogether form
the second law of thermodynamics for equilibrium systems.
The third part of the second law of thermodynamics refers to the time evolution
of thermodynamic systems and has to do with the growth of entropy in spontaneous
and irreversible processes. It therefore corresponds to the dynamic aspect of the
principle of maximum entropy. We emphasize, however, that this aspect is not used
explicitly, since we treat only systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast,
the static aspect of the maximum entropy principle is used explicitly in the form
given by the Clausius-Gibbs principle. When the initial and ﬁnal states of an
irreversible process are made up of equilibrium states a close relationship exists
between the two aspects, which we analyze below.

Clausius-Gibbs Principle
3.3.2
Spontaneous Processes
When two bodies at different temperatures are placed in thermal contact, a ﬂow
of heat spontaneously establishes from the hotter to the colder body until the
temperatures become equal and the ﬂow ceases. From that moment on, the bodies
remain in thermal equilibrium. Before being placed in contact, each body separately
is in thermodynamicequilibrium. The moment they are brought into contact, the two
bodies are in an state out of equilibrium that evolves into a state of ﬁnal equilibrium.
It is important to note that we are considering bodies constituting an isolated system,
which does not exchange heat or work, that is, such that the total energy and volume
remain invariant.
We can imagine the more general case where several bodies, or various parts of
the same system, are separated by the existence of thermal constraints, arising from
adiabatic walls, or mechanical constraints, due to rigid walls. When the constraints
are removed while the system as a whole is isolated, they evolve spontaneously to
the unrestricted equilibrium. A spontaneous process is therefore a process occurring
in an isolated system, whose initial state is a state of constrained equilibrium and
whose ﬁnal state is a state of unconstrained equilibrium. The initial and ﬁnal states
have the same energy and the same volume since the system is isolated.
The principle of maximum entropy leads to conclude that in a spontaneous
process the entropy increases. As an example, consider a body in thermal contact
with a reservoir at a temperature T0. Suppose that the body ﬁnds itself initially at a
temperature T1 and the thermal contact takes place at constant volume. The variation
of the total energy of the reservoir and body is given by

the integral is also positive. If T1 D T0 the integral vanishes. Therefore, in all cases

Maximum Work
Suppose now that the body reaches the ﬁnal state by a process in which the total
energy is not maintained constant. We imagine that the difference in total energy is
transformed into work Wtotal, performed against the outside. Thus, the variation of
the total energy can be nonzero and moreover Wtotal D Utotal. We may ask about
the maximum work that the composite system can perform when the body is taken

Microscopic Interpretation of Entropy
Entropy has a microscopic interpretation that is used as the foundation of sta-
tistical mechanics. According to Boltzmann, entropy is related to the number of
microscopic states available to the system. The higher the number W of accessible
microscopic states the higher the entropy S. However, entropy does not grow
linearly with the number of accessible states but grows logarithmically, that is,
S D kB ln W;
(3.50)
where kB is a universal proportionality constant called Boltzmann constant.
Let us examine what happens to entropy when an ideal gas expands freely.
Imagine a vessel consisting of two compartments separated by a rigid and adiabatic
wall. An ideal gas at a temperature T occupies one compartment whereas the other
is empty. In a given moment, the separation wall is removed and the gas expands
freely occupying the whole vessel and reaching equilibrium. Because the system is
isolated, there is no variation of energy, so that the ﬁnal temperature will be the same
as the energy of an ideal gas depends only on the temperature. We suppose that the
volume V of the vessel is ` times greater than the volume V1 of the compartment
where the gas was, that is, V D `V1. As the gas is ideal, the ﬁnal pressure p will
be ` times smaller than the initial pressure p1, that is, p D p1=`. Using equation
(2.44) for the entropy of an ideal gas, we obtain the following variation of entropy
S D NR ln `:
(3.51)
After the expansion, each molecule of the gas may wander in a space ` times
greater which means that it has a number of possibilities, or microscopic states, `
times greater. The gas as a whole has, therefore, a number of microscopic states `n
times greater, where n is the number of gas molecules. The ratio W=W1 between
the ﬁnal number W and the initial number W1 of microscopic states is, therefore,
W=W1 D `n. Using the Boltzmann formula (3.50), we get for the variation of
entropy the expression
S D kB ln W  kB ln W1 D kB ln W
W1
;
(3.52)
or
S D kB ln `n D nkB ln `;
(3.53)
which is identical to the expression (3.51).
The number of molecules divided by the number of moles is equal to the number
of molecules in 1 mole NA, called Avogadro constant. Comparing expressions (3.51)
and (3.53), we see that the Boltzmann constant kB and the universal gas constant R
are related by

Fundamental Relation
4.1.1
Energy Representation
The thermodynamic properties of an isotropic ﬂuid, conﬁned in a vessel, involve
several thermodynamic quantities such as pressure, temperature, volume, the inter-
nal energy and entropy. These quantities are not all independent. To determine how
many and which may be treated as independent we start by examining the equation
dU D TdS  pdV:
(4.1)
We see that it is natural to imagine as U as dependenton S and V . Furthermore, if we
understand the internal energy U.S; V / as a function of S and V , then this equation
allows us to obtain also the pressure and temperature as functions of S and V through
the relations
T D @U
@S ;
p D @U
@V :
(4.2)
The reasonings above were done by considering a given quantity of material
contained in the vessel. However, the amount of substance that composes the ﬂuid
may also be changed. To completely specify the thermodynamic state of the ﬂuid
we should therefore indicate the number of moles N of the substance in the vessel
in addition to S and V . The thermodynamic equilibrium state becomes deﬁned by
the independent variables S, V and N . In an equivalent manner, we may say that
each state of thermodynamic equilibrium of an isotropic ﬂuid composed by a single
pure substance corresponds to a point in the thermodynamic space .S; V; N /. Note
that we are assuming the ﬂuid as composed by a single pure substance. For a ﬂuid
comprising several substances it would be necessary to indicate the number of moles
of each substance.
Since U is also a function of N , it is convenient to deﬁne a quantity that is
associated with the variation of energy when one makes an increase in the number of

	 D @U
@N ;
(4.3)
so that we may write the conservation of energy in differential form as
dU D TdS  pdV C 	dN:
(4.4)
The internal energy U.S; V; N / as a function of the independent variables S,
V and N is called the fundamental relation in the energy representation because
from it we can obtain the thermodynamic properties of the system in consideration.
Deriving the energy with respect to S, V , and N , we obtain the equations (4.2)
and (4.3), called equations of state in the energy representation. We assume as a
postulate that the internal energy U and its derivatives T , p and 	 are continuous
functions or, equivalently, that the internal energy is a continuous and differentiable
function of entropy, volume, and number of moles.
4.1.2
Entropy Representation
Inverting the fundamental relation U.S; V; N / with respect to S, we get the entropy
S.U; V; N / as a function of the independent variables U , V , and N , which is the
fundamental relation in the entropy representation because from it we can obtain
the thermodynamic properties of the system in consideration. In this representation,
the thermodynamic state is deﬁned by a point in the space .U; V; N /. From (4.4) we
may write

in the entropy representation.
Since S.U / is the inverse of U.S/ and, being the energy continuous and
differentiable in S, V and N , then the entropy is a continuous and differentiable
function of the energy, volume, and number of moles.
4.2
Extensivity
4.2.1
Extensive Variables
The thermodynamic systems exhibit the property of extensivity. The main con-
sequence of this property is a reduction in number of variables necessary for

4.2
Extensivity

the description of a thermodynamic system. For the analysis of the property of
extensivity, we should initially distinguish the variables that are extensible from
those that we call thermodynamic ﬁelds, which are not extensive. The volume V , the
internal energy U , the entropy S and the number of moles N are extensive variables.
The pressure p, the temperature T and the chemical potential 	 are thermodynamic
ﬁelds. In a system in equilibrium, the thermodynamic ﬁelds have the same value in
each part of the system, regardless of the size of each part. The extensive variables
on the other hand take on values that depend on the size of each part.
Let us imagine two copies of the same system such that one of them is an
enlargement of the other in the following sense. The entropies, the volumes, and the
number of moles of the two copies are related by S2 D 
S1, V2 D 
V1 and N2 D

N1, where 
 is the enlargement factor. The system is described by the fundamental
equation U.S; V; N / so that the energies are given by U2 D U.S2; V2; N2/ and
U1 D U.S1; V1; N1/. It exhibits the property of extensivity if the energies U1 and
U2 are also related by U2 D 
U1. This means to say that the fundamental relation
obeys the equation

U.S; V; N / D U.
S; 
V; 
N /;
(4.7)
for any positive values of 
. That is, U must be a homogeneous ﬁrst order function
of S, V , and N .
Deriving both sides of (4.7) with respect to 
 and then setting 
 D 1, we get
U D TS  pV C 	N;
(4.8)
which is the Euler equation. From the fundamental relation, the equations of state
are obtained by differentiation. If, however, we do not know the fundamental
relation, but the three equations of state, that is, T , p, and 	 as functions of S, V and
N , then it can be obtained by integration or by replacing into the Euler equation. In
fact, the knowledge of two equations of state plus the property of extensivity sufﬁces
to obtain the fundamental relation.
4.2.2
Molar Quantities
The property of extensivity, given by relation (4.7), enables the description of
a thermodynamic system by a smaller number of independent variables. Such
a description involves quantities called thermodynamic densities, deﬁned as the
ratio of extensive quantities. Although they are not extensive, the thermodynamic
densities are a class of thermodynamic variables that must be distinguished from the
class of thermodynamic ﬁelds. Particularly useful are the thermodynamic densities
obtained by dividing the extensive quantities by the number of moles N , called
molar quantities. Thus, we deﬁne the energy per mole, or molar energy, u D U=N ,
entropy per mole, or molar entropy, s D S=N and the volume per mole, or molar
volume, v D V=N .

Thermodynamic Potentials
If in the relation (4.7) we set 
 D 1=N , then the left hand side becomes the molar
energy u and the right hand side becomes a function of two variables only: the molar
entropy s and molar volume v. We may conclude that u.s; v/ is a function s and v
only and that
U.S; V; N / D Nu. S

(4.9)
Therefore, if we know u.s; v/, the fundamental relation can immediately be
recovered by the above formula. That is, u.s; v/ is equivalent to the fundamental
relationship.

which allows us to write the differential form for the molar energy,

The extensivity of S.U; V; N / allows us to conclude also that the thermodynamic
properties can be determined from the molar entropy s.u; v/ as a function of the
molar energy u and the molar volume v. If we know s.u; v/, we can recover the
fundamental relation in the entropy representation through

S.T / which, replaced in (4.32), gives

the inverse of T .S/ to obtain S.T / which is the derivative of F with respect to T ;

Heat, Work and Thermodynamic Potentials
The heat received by a system in an isochoric process equals the variation of the
internal energy, since the work vanishes, that is,
U D Qv:
(4.67)
If, on the other hand, we consider an isobaric process, then the variation of energy
will be
U D Qp  pV;
(4.68)
because the work done is pV for an isobaric process. But the variation of enthalpy
in an isobaric process is H D U C pV and
H D Qp;
(4.69)
that is, the heat received by the system in an isobaric process equals the variation of
enthalpy.
The work consumed by a system in a quasi-static adiabatic process equals the
variation of the internal energy, since there is no heat exchanged, that is,
U D Wad:
(4.70)
If, on the other hand, we consider an isothermal process, then the heat received is
given by QT D TS, so that the variation of internal energy will be
U D TS  WT;
(4.71)
where WT is the work done along an isothermal process. Taking into account that in
an isothermal process the variation of the Helmholtz free energy is F D U 
TS, then
F D WT;
(4.72)
that is, the work consumed by a system along an isothermal process equals the
variation of the Helmholtz free energy.
The isochoric heat capacity Cv is deﬁned as the limit of the ratio Qv=T , when
T ! 0, between the heat introduced at constant volume and the increment in
temperature. Taking into account the equality (4.67), the ratio becomes equal to
U=T along an isochoric line process and therefore
Cv D .@U =@T /V :
(4.73)
The isobaric heat capacity Cp is deﬁned as the limit of the ratio Qp=T , when

Clausius-Gibbs Principle
We saw in the previous chapter that the principle of minimum energy can be
translated by the equation
U.S; V /  U0  T0.S  S0/  p0.V  V0/;
(4.75)
established for a system in which the number of moles is kept constant, where
U0 D U.S0; V0/. To include processes in which the number of moles may vary, we
generalize this inequality to include the number of moles. To this end, we ﬁrst divide
both sides of equation (4.75) by the number of moles N to obtain
u.s; v/  u0  T0.s  s0/  p0.v  v0/;
(4.76)
where u0 D u.s0; v0/.
Next, we use the Euler equation in the form u0 D T0s0  p0v0 C 	0 to eliminate
u0 in expression (4.76) and to obtain the inequality
u.s; v/  T0s  p0v C 	0:
(4.77)
Multiplying both members of the inequality by the number of moles N , we get
U.S; V; N /  T0S  p0V C 	0N;
(4.78)
which subtracted from the Euler equation, U0 D T0S0  p0V0 C 	0N0, gives
U  U0  T0.S  S0/  p0.V  V0/ C 	0.N  N0/;
(4.79)
which is the expression of the principle of minimum energy in all three variables.

Example of a concave function: the Helmholtz free energy F.T / versus temperature T
which is obtained directly from the inequality (4.79). The inequalities (4.79)
and (4.80) are the expression of the Clausius-Gibbs principle.
4.4.2
Convex and Concave Functions
The principle of minimum energy is equivalent to saying that energy is a convex
function of all extensive variables jointly. Similarly, the principle of maximum
entropy is equivalent to saying that entropy is a concave function of all extensive
variables jointly. Furthermore, an important property in respect to convex and
concave functions is that a Legendre transformation converts a convex function
into a concave function and vice versa. That is, both functions that are linked by
a Legendre transformation form a pair of function such that one is convex and the
other is concave. It is therefore appropriate to examine the properties of convex and
concave functions. We analyze initially a convex function of a single variable, the
internal energy U.S/ as a function of the entropy S, and a concave function of a
single variable, the Helmholtz free energy, F.T / as a function of temperature T .
The variables V and N are taken as constant.
The convexity of a convex or concave function manifests itself if we consider any
tangent to the curve described by the function. All the curve will be entirely on one
side of the tangent line. The convex functions are those curves that lie above any
tangent to the curve whereas the concave curves are those that lie below any tangent
to the curves, as shown in Fig. 4.2.
Consider the tangent to the convex function U.S/ at the point .S0; U0/, where
U0 D U.S0/. The equation that describes the tangent line is
y.S/ D U.S0/ C U1.S0/.S  S0/;
(4.81)
where U1.S0/ is the slope of the tangent line. Taking into account that U.S/ is
differentiable, then U1.S0/ may be identiﬁed with the derivative of U calculated at
S D S0. Since U.S/ is a convex function, then U.S/  y.S/, that is,

4.4
Convexity
59
U.S/  U.S0/ C U1.S0/.S  S0/;
(4.82)
valid for any value of S, as can be seen in Fig. 4.2a. This inequality is the same
inequality (4.79) for the case in which the volume and the number of moles remains
constant. It sufﬁces to recall that U1.S0/ D T0.
A convex function U.S/ has two fundamental properties:
(a) The derivative U1.S/ is monotonic increasing function of S.
(b) If the function U.S/ has the second derivative U11.S/ at a certain point S D S0,
then the convexity condition implies
U11.S0/  0:
(4.83)
Let us examine now the concave function F.T /. Similarly, we consider a tangent
to the curve described by F.T / at a point .T0; F0/, where F0 D F.T0/. The heights
of the points on the tangent line are given by
y.T / D F.T0/ C F1.T0/.T  T0/;
(4.84)
where F1.T0/ is the slope of the line. At the points where F.T / is differentiable,
F1.T0/ is identiﬁed with the derivative of F.T / calculated at T0. Since F.T / is
concave then F.T /  y.T /, that is,
F.T /  F.T0/ C F1.T0/.T  T0/;
(4.85)
valid for any value of T , as seen in Fig. 4.2b.
The concave function F.T / has the fundamental properties:
(a) The derivative of F1.T / is a monotonic decreasing function of T .
(b) If the function F.T / has the second derivative F11.T / at a certain point T D T0,
then the convexity condition implies
F11.T0/  0:
(4.86)
4.4.3
Convex and Concave Function in Many Variables
Equation (4.82) may be generalized to the case of a function of more than one
variable. Let us consider initially the case of a function of two variable: the internal
energy U.S; V / as a function of the entropy S and the volume V , only. We are
assuming that the number of moles N remains constant. Taking into account that
U.S; V / is differentiable, then its convexity is expressed by the inequality
U.S; V /  U.S0; V0/ C U1.S0; V0/.S  S0/ C U2.S0; V0/.V  V0/;
(4.87)

60
4
Thermodynamic Potentials
where U1.S0; V0/ and U2.S0; V0/ are the derivatives of U.S; V / with respect to S
and V , respectively, calculated at the point .S0; V0/. The right hand site of this
inequality describes a tangent plane to the surface described by U.S; V / at the
point .S0; V0/. The surface lies entirely above the plane. This inequality is identiﬁed
with (4.79). It sufﬁces to recall that U1.S0; V0/ D T0 and U2.S0; V0/ D p0.
Since U.S; V / is convex in the two variables jointly, it follows that U11.S0; V0/,
U12.S0; V0/ and U22.S0; V0/ satisfy the properties
U11  0;
U22  0
(4.88)
and
.U12/2  U11U22  0:
(4.89)
Next we analyze the Helmholtz free energy F.T; V / as a function of temperature
T and volume V , holding the number of moles N ﬁxed. The Helmholtz free energy
is obtained from the internal energy by means of a Legendre transformation. This
makes F.T; V / a concave function of T while remaining a convex function of V . It
therefore obeys the inequalities
F.T; V /  F.T; V0/ C F2.T; V0/.V  V0/
(4.90)
and
F.T; V /  F.T0; V / C F1.T0; V /.T  T0/;
(4.91)
where the coefﬁcients F1.T; V0/ and F2.T0; V / of the tangent lines are identiﬁed
with the derivatives of F.T; V / with respect to T and V , respectively, calculated at
the points where F.T; V / is differentiable. The Helmholtz free energy F.T; V / is
an example of a concave-convex function.
Since F.T; V / is concave in T and convex in V , it follows that its second
derivatives F11.T0; V0/ and F22.T0; V0/ satisﬁes the properties
F11  0;
F22  0:
(4.92)
The enthalpy is also obtained from the internal energy by a Legendre transfor-
mation. For ﬁxed N , the enthalpy H.S; p/ is a convex function of S and concave
in p and obeys the inequalities
H.S; p/  H.S0; p/ C H1.S0; p/.S  S0/
(4.93)
and
H.S; p/  H.S; p0/ C H2.S; p0/.p  p0/;
(4.94)
where the coefﬁcients H1.S0; p/ and H2.S; p0/ of the tangent lines are identiﬁed
with the derivatives of H.S; p/ with respect to S and p, respectively, calculated at
the points where H.S; p/ is differentiable. The enthalpy is also an example of a
concave-convex function.

4.4
Convexity
61
Since H.S; p/ is convex in S and concave in p, it follows that the second
derivatives H11.S0; p0/ and H22.S0; p0/ satisﬁes the properties
H11  0;
H22  0:
(4.95)
We now examine the Gibbs free energy G.T; p/ as a function of temperature
T and pressure p, at constant number of moles N . The Gibbs free energy is
obtained from the internal energy U.S; V / by means of two successive Legendre
transformations. This makes G.T; P / concave in both variables T and p, jointly.
The convexity manifests itself by the inequality
G.T; p/  G.T0; p0/ C G1.T0; p0/.T  T0/ C G2.T0; p0/.p  p0/;
(4.96)
where G1.T0; p0/ and G2.T0; p0/ are the coefﬁcients that deﬁnes the slope of the
tangent plane and are identiﬁed with the derivatives of G.T; p/ with respect to T
and p, respectively, calculated at the points where G.T; p/ is differentiable.
Since G.T; p/ is concave in two variable jointly, it follows that its second
derivatives G11.T0; p0/, G12.T0; p0/ and G22.T0; p0/ satisﬁes the properties
G11  0;
G22  0
(4.97)
and
.G12/2  G11G22  0:
(4.98)
4.4.4
Convex Hull
In some situations, the description of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is
done by means of a potential deﬁned as the convex hull of a function F.V /, as
the one shown in Fig. 4.3a, which is devoid of the convexity property. The convex
hull Fch.V / of F.V / is obtained as follows. We start by determining the Legendre
transformation
G.p/ D min
V fF.V / C pVg;
(4.99)
which is a concave function. Next, we perform the inverse Legendre transformation
Fch.V / D min
p fG.p/  Vpg;
(4.100)
which gives us a convex function, the convex hull of F.V /.
The convex hull Fch.V / may be obtained more simply by the construction of a
double tangent, as seen in Fig. 4.3a. The double tangent AB gives rise to a horizontal
line segment A0B0 in the derivative pch.V / D @Fch=@V of the convex hull, as seen
in Fig. 4.3b. This horizontal segment guarantees that pch.V / is a monotonic function

although the derivative p.V / D @F=@V of the original function does not have this
property.
To set up the convex hull Fch.V / it sufﬁces to determine VA and VB, the values of
V at the tangential points A and B, respectively. Let p be the slope of the double
tangent. According to the Fig. 4.3a,
F.VA/  F.VB/ D p.VB  VA/:
(4.101)
Taking into account that the slopes at the tangential points A and B are equal, then
p.VA/ D p;
p.VB/ D p:
(4.102)
These three equations determine p, VA and VB from F.V / and its derivative.
Equations (4.101) and (4.102), that determine the localization of the double
tangent AB and therefore the horizontal segment A0B0, are valid even if F.V / has
a singular behavior in the interval between the points VA and VB, as happens when
F.V / is deﬁned by two unconnected branches. When the function F.V / is well
behaved, the position of the segment A0B0 is such that the area above A0B0 is equal
to the area below A0B0, as seen in Fig. 4.3b. The achievement of the segment A0B0
made according to this result is called Maxwell construction and is equivalent to
the making of the double tangent. To demonstrate this result we proceed as follows.
Integrating p.V / between VA and VB, we get
Z VB
VA
p.V /dV D F.VA/  F.VB/:
(4.103)
Using result (4.101), we see that

can separate the integral in two and obtain
Z VC

fp  p.V /gdV D
Z VB

fp.V /  pgdV;
(4.106)
which is the desired result since the right and left hand sides of these equations are,
respectively, equal to the areas above and below the segment that join the two points
A0 and B0.
4.4.5
Fundamental Properties of the Thermodynamic
Potentials
Below we summarize the properties of the thermodynamic potentials, which are
obtained by successive Legendre transformations. We recall initially that the internal
energy is a function of extensive variables only. The thermodynamic ﬁelds are
obtained by differentiation of the internal energy. A given thermodynamic ﬁeld
obtained by differentiation of the internal energy with respect to a certain extensive
variable, constitutes with it a pair of conjugate variables.
At each Legendre transformation,a extensive variable is replaced by its conjugate
thermodynamic ﬁeld. Each thermodynamic potential is, therefore, a function of a
set of extensive variables and a set of thermodynamic ﬁelds, which constitute the
thermodynamic space related to this potential. Notice that just one component of a
pair of conjugate variables makes part of the thermodynamic space. The other pair
component is obtained by differentiation of the thermodynamic potential.
The fundamental properties of a thermodynamic potential associated to a ther-
modynamic space are the followings:
(a) Continuity of the potential.
The potential is a continuous function of all variables of the thermodynamic
space.
(b) Continuity of the thermodynamic ﬁeld.
The potential is differentiable with respect to the extensive variables of the
thermodynamicspace. This property is equivalent to the following. A thermody-
namic ﬁeld obtained by differentiation of the potential is a continuous function
of all variables of the thermodynamic space.
(c) Extensivity of the potential.
A thermodynamic potential is an extensive function of the extensive variable or,
equivalently, it is homogeneous of the ﬁrst order in the extensive variables.
(d) Convexity of the potential.

64

Thermodynamic Potentials
A thermodynamic potential is a convex function of the set of extensive variables
and a concave function of the set of thermodynamic ﬁelds.
The thermodynamic potentials related to the thermodynamic space contain-
ing just one extensive variable are particularly useful, mainly in the study of
phase transitions. The thermodynamic quantity deﬁned as the ratio between one
of such potentials and the extensive variable depends only on the thermody-
namic ﬁelds and is also identiﬁed as a thermodynamic ﬁeld.

that is, the functions s1.u; v/ and s2.u; v/ and, therefore, the equations of state (5.1)

The Maxwell relations are useful, for example, when one wishes to obtain

Maxwell relation above says that the isothermal variation of the entropy with the
volume is equal to the isochoric increase of pressure with temperature. These

Reduction of Derivatives
A thermodynamic system can be described in various ways, according to the
representation we have chosen. This variety of descriptions leads us to a large
number of equivalent results, which can be revealed by the thermodynamicidentities
given above. In general, these identities involve the derivatives of thermodynamic
variables. To achieve identities in a systematic way, we present a scheme to reduce

72

a given derivative in terms of other previously chosen. In the scheme we present

1. Bring the thermodynamic potentials U , F , H and G to the numerator, using
identities (5.22) or (5.24) and, next, eliminate them, using the identities (5.10)–
(5.13).
2. Bring the entropy to the numerator, using identities (5.22) or (5.24) and, then
eliminate them, by the use of the Maxwell relations (5.15) and (5.17) or through
the deﬁnitions of the heat capacities Cp or Cv. If these two alternatives are not
appropriate, use the identities

that the internal energy of an ideal gas does not depend on the volume, but only
on temperature or, equivalently, that there is no variation in temperature in a free
expansion of an ideal gas.

Joule-Thomson Process
In a Joule-Thomson process, also called throttling process, a gas is forced through
a porous wall so that the enthalpy of the gas remains unchanged. The pressure
difference on both sides of the wall is p and we wish to know the temperature
variation T . For small pressure differences, the variation of temperature is T D

Virial Expansion
For sufﬁciently low densities, the gases follows the ideal behavior pV D NRT
which we write as
p D RT N;
(5.58)
where N D N=V is the number of moles per unit volume. The plot represented
in Fig. 5.1a shows the pressure of hydrogen as a function of density for several
temperatures. For low densities we see that indeed p is proportional to N and
therefore the hydrogen behaves as an ideal gas in this regime. However, deviations
from this behavior can be seen in this ﬁgure, if the density is not sufﬁciently small.
To examine the deviation from the ideal behavior it is convenient to plot the
compressibility factor Z D p=RT N D pv=RT as a function of N, where v D
V=N D 1= N is the molar volume. Figure 5.1b shows such a plot for hydrogen.

Equation (5.59) may describe the general behavior of gases, as long as the
expansion contains a sufﬁcient number of terms. Alternatively, it is possible to
describe the general behavior by means of approximate equations of state such as

5.4.2
Measurement of Compressibility
An experiment to measure the compressibility of gases is performed as follows. We
consider a vessel with adiabatic walls, in the form of a bottle, which encloses the gas

5.4
Gas Properties
77
whose compressibility we want to measure. In the neck of the bottle, which has a
cylindrical shape, there is a small object of mass m, that can move without friction.
The weight of the object is such that it is in equilibrium position when the volume
of the gas is V0 and the pressure of the gas is p0. The object is then displaced from
its equilibrium position and starts to oscillate with a certain angular frequency !.
The equation of motion of the object is given by
md 2x
dt2 D .p  p0/A;
(5.63)
where A is the cross-sectional area of the bottle neck. The pressure at the
equilibrium point p0 is equal to the pressure due to the weight of the object plus
the atmospheric air pressure patm, that is, p0 D patm C mg=A, where g is the
acceleration of gravity. We are assuming that the equilibrium point occurs at x D 0,
so that the volume depends on x as V D V0 C Ax.
Assuming that the oscillations are adiabatic, the pressure and the volume are
connected by an adiabatic line, so that, for small oscillations, that is, for small
volume variations,
p  p0

(5.64)
and therefore
md 2x

(5.65)
where the constant k is given by k D A2=sV0. But the angular frequency ! of
oscillations is related to the constant k by ! D
p
k=m, from which we get
! D
s
A2
sV0m:
(5.66)
Therefore, measuring the angular frequency !, knowing the dimensions of the
bottle, that is, the volume V0 and the area A, and the mass m of the object, one
can determine the adiabatic compressibility.
If we know the isothermal compressibility T independently, then this experi-
ment allows us to determined the ratio between the heat capacities  D Cp=Cv
because, according to (5.33), s D T =. For instance, if the gas can be considered
ideal then T D 1=p0.
The speed of sound in a gas is given by vsom D
p
.@p=@/s where  is the gas
density, related to N by  D M N where M is the gas molar mass. Since .@p=@/s D

Considering the atmospheric air as an ideal gas, we can use formula (5.68) to

that is, pressure of 1 atm and temperature of 0 ıC, the experimental values are
 D 1:293 kg/m3 and  D 1:403. With these data we ﬁnd vsom D 331:6 m/s. For
comparison, the value of the speed of sound in atmospheric air measured by direct
means vsom D 331:5 m/s.
5.4.3
Inversion Curve
One way of achieving lower temperatures is through the Joule-Thomson process.
To decrease the temperature of the gas when it passes through the porous wall, it is
necessary that the Joule-Thomson coefﬁcient 	JT is positive since the pressure of
the gas necessarily decreases. For a given gas, we can draw in the p  T diagram
the region for which 	JT > 0, which is the region useful for cooling through the
Joule-Thomson process. This region is bounded by the curve 	JT D 0, called the
inversion curve.
Let us determine the inverse curve for a ﬂuid obeying the van der Waals equation
(5.60). According to the result (5.57), the inversion curve is given by T D 1=˛, that
is, by

Figure 5.2 shows the inversion curve, according to this equation and the inverse

the liquid-vapor coexistence line. We shall see later that the van der Waals equation
in fact provides a liquid-vapor coexistence line and a critical point, shown in
Fig. 5.2a. The critical temperature Tc and critical pressure pc are related to the
parameters a and b by Tc D 8a=27bR and pc D a=27b2.
5.4.4
Molar Heat Capacity
The molar heat capacity of the ideal gases, that is, those that obey the equation of
state pv D RT, depends only on temperature. In fact, from equation (5.47) it is
seen that for an ideal gas .@u=@v/T D 0 and, therefore, the molar internal energy
u is independent of v. Since the molar enthalpy h D u C pv D u C RT, then
h is also independent of v. Therefore, the molar heat capacities cv D .@u=@T /v
and cp D .@h=@T /p, depend only on T . Moreover, taking into account that h D
u C RT then cp D cv C R. Figure 5.3a shows cp of hydrogen as a function of
temperature, for several values of pressure. Notice that, at high temperatures, cp
becomes independent of pressure and approaches the value .7=2/R.
Figure 5.3b shows cp of several gases that have behavior close to the ideal
behavior. We assume that for these gases cv is a sum of the terms
cv D ctrans C crot C cvib
(5.72)
corresponding to the translation motion, rotation and vibration of the molecules.
According to the equipartition of energy ctrans D .3=2/R. The rotational part is

Nernst Postulate
6.1.1
Entropy
At sufﬁciently low temperatures, it is experimentally shown that the thermal
capacity of the solids decreases appreciably and vanishes in the limit of zero
absolute temperature. This behavior however does not necessarily follow from the
laws of thermodynamics seen so far. It is one of the consequences of the Nernst
postulate according to which the entropy of a system does not decrease without
limits, but approaches a constant in the limit of zero absolute temperature, that is,
S.T / ! S0
when
T ! 0:
(6.1)
Although the existence of a lower bound for the entropy seems to be quite
evident, we must remember that this does not occur in a system whose heat capacity
is constant, like an ideal gas whose internal energy is linear with temperature.
The entropy of a system with constant heat capacity behaves as ln T and therefore
decreases without bounds as T ! 0. Therefore, the heat capacity can not remain
constant at low enough temperatures if S has a lower bound.
If the temperature of a system is decreased along an isobaric line, the entropy
S.T / can be determined by
S.T /  S0 D
Z T

Cp

(6.2)
where the integral is performed along and isobaric line. Since S and S0 are ﬁnite,
the integral must also be ﬁnite. The integral will be ﬁnite if the heat capacities at
constant pressure Cp vanish when T ! 0. Similarly, we conclude that the heat
capacity at constant volume vanishes when T ! 0.

Nernst-Planck Principle
The Nernst postulate has a second part: the entropy S0 is the same for any state
of a system at temperature zero. This means to say that the isotherm corresponding
to the absolute zero coincides with an isentropic line. It should be noted that only in
this case an isotherm coincides with an isentropic line. For nonzero temperatures, an
isotherm never coincides with an isentropic line. We also note that S0 is the smallest
value of the entropy of a thermodynamic system because the entropy is a monotonic
increasing function of temperature.
Being S0 a constant, the derivative .@S=@p/T vanishes at T D 0. Since by
the Maxwell relation .@S=@p/T D .@V=@T /p, then the coefﬁcient of thermal
expansion ˛ D .1=V /.@V=@T /p also vanishes at the absolute zero of temperature.
Similarly, the derivative .@S=@V /T vanishes when T D 0. Using the Maxwell
relation .@S=@V /T D .@p=@T /v, we conclude that the coefﬁcient ˇ D .@p=@T /v
also vanishes at zero absolute temperature. On the other hand, the compressibilities
T D .1=V /.@V=@p/T and S D .1=V /.@V=@p/S do not necessarily vanish. In
general, these two quantities remain nonzero. We remark that they become identical
at absolute zero, since the isotherm T
D 0 coincides with the isentropic line
S D S0.
As an experimental illustration of the Nernst postulate we consider the entropy
of sulfur. This substance can be found in two crystalline forms known as rhombic
and monoclinic. Below T0 D 368:6 K, the stable form is the rhombic. Above this
temperature, the stable form is the monoclinic. At the transition temperature T0,
rhombic sulfur consumes q D 402 ˙ 2 J/mol, where q is the latent heat of transition
from rhombic to monoclinic. In this conversion, carried out at constant temperature,
the entropy of sulfur increases by the value q=T0 D 1:091 ˙ 0:005 J/mol K.
From the measurement of heat capacity of rhombic sulfur, it is possible to
determine the variation of molar entropy srhomb  s0 between T D 0 and T D T0
from the formula (6.2). Using the same formula, we can also determine the change in
entropy smon s0 in the same temperature range for the monoclinic sulfur. Although
the monoclinic form is not stable below T0, the transformation speed to the rhombic
form is very slow, enough for the experimental determination of its heat capacity.
Therefore, the entropy difference smon  srhomb can be determined by
smon  srhomb D
Z T0

cp

(6.3)
where cp D cmon

is the difference between the molar heat capacities
of the two forms of sulfur. We are assuming according to the Nernst postulate that
S0 is the same for both allotropic forms. Figure 6.1 shows the thermal capacities
and the difference between them as a function of temperature. The integral in (6.3),
performed numerically from the experimental data presented in Fig. 6.1, provides
the value smon  srhomb D 0:90 ˙ 0:17 J/mol K, close to the value obtained above.
Another example is the entropy of tin. This substance has two allotropic forms
known as white tin, which is metallic and has a tetragonal structure, and gray tin,
which is semiconductor and has a cubic structure. The gray tin is stable below 13 ıC

and white tin is stable above this temperature. Under 13 ıC, white tin is metastable
and transforms itself into gray tin, a phenomenon known as tin pest. However, the
transformation is slow enough so that they heat capacity measurements can be made.
From the results of the thermal capacity of the two forms, one obtains the value
8.1 J/mol K for the change in entropy. On the other hand, from the latent heat, which
is 2.28 kJ/mol, we obtain the value 8.0 J/mol K very close to the previous value.
6.1.2
Thermodynamic Potentials
Decreasing the temperature of a system at constant volume, the internal energy also
diminishes. In fact, along an isochoric line, the energy is a monotonic increasing
function of temperature because .@U=@T /v D Cv  0. In the limit of absolute zero,
the internal energy approaches its lowest value, which we postulate to be ﬁnite. That
is, the internal energy has a lower bound which is reached when T ! 0, that is,
U ! U0
when
T ! 0:
(6.4)
The corresponding state is called ground state.
Taking into account that the Helmholtz free energy is related to the internal
energy through F D U  TS, then in the limit of absolute zero F coincides with
U , that is,
F ! F0 D U0
when
T ! 0;
(6.5)
because S0 is ﬁnite.
Using the relation .@H=@T /p D Cp  0, we see that the enthalpy of a system
is monotonic increasing function of temperature, at constant pressure. In the limit

86
6
Nernst-Planck Principle
of absolute zero, the enthalpy approaches its lowest value, which we postulate to be
ﬁnite. The enthalpy has therefore a lower bound, which is reached when T ! 0,
that is,
H ! H0
when
T ! 0:
(6.6)
Taking into account that the Gibbs free energy is related to the enthalpy by G D
H  TS, then in the limit of absolute zero G coincides with H, that is,
G ! G0 D H0
when
T ! 0:
(6.7)
We should note that, unlike S0, the thermodynamic potentials at zero temperature
U0, F0, H0 and G0 may depend on other thermodynamic variables.
6.2
Heat Capacity of Solids
6.2.1
Dulong-Petit Law
The heat capacity of the solids is usually measured at constant pressure and not
at constant volume, since the low compressibility of the solid makes it difﬁcult to
maintain the volume constant. However, from cp we get cv using the identity
cp D cv C T v˛2
T
;
(6.8)
provided the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion ˛ and the isothermal compressibility
T are known. In any event, the second term is small but not negligible for solids.
The Table 6.1 shows the isobaric heat capacity of several solids at room temperature.
According to the Dulong-Petit law, the molar heat capacity of a solid is constant
and has the same value 3R for any solid. We assume that the Dulong-Petit law is
valid for the isochoric molar heat capacity,
cv D 3R:
(6.9)
From Table 6.1 and taking into account that cv is close to cp, we see that
the Dulong-Petit Law is reasonably obeyed at room temperature, but with some
signiﬁcant deviations. However, the greatest deviation from the Dulong-Petit law is
not apparent in Table 6.1, because it occurs at low temperatures. In this regime the
heat capacity becomes small and vanishes when T ! 0.
From the microscopic point of view, the Dulong-Petit law can be understood if
we consider a harmonic solid, that is, a solid whose interatomic potential energy
contains terms up to second order in the deviations of atoms from their equilibrium
positions. It can be shown that such a system is equivalent to a set of independent
one-dimensional oscillators whose frequencies of oscillation are the frequencies of

the normal modes of vibration of the solid. Appealing to the theorem of equipartition
of energy, valid for high temperatures, we assume that the kinetic and potential
energies of each oscillator contributes each with a term equal to kBT=2 to the
total energy of the solid, where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Since the number
of oscillators is equal to the number of degrees of freedom 3n, where n is the
total number of atoms of the solid, then the contribution of the total energy of
oscillators is 3nkBT D 3NRT. Taking into account the potential energy of atoms
in its equilibrium position, which we denote by U0, then the molar energy u of the
solid is
u D u0 C 3RT
(6.10)
where u0 D U0=N depends only on the molar volume v. From this result we get
cv D .@u=@T /v D 3R, which is the Dulong-Petit law.

Debye Theory
At low temperatures, the heat capacity of solids deviates appreciably from the
Dulong-Petit law. According to Debye theory, the heat capacity of the solids
behaves, in this regime, according to the law
cv D aT 3;
(6.11)
and vanishes as T ! 0, in accordance with the Nernst postulate. The same behavior
applies to cp, as we shall see, which can be seen in Fig. 6.2 where the experimental
data of cp=T for KCl are plotted as a function of T 2.
The Debye theory also provides an interpolation between this law, valid for
low temperatures, and the law of Dulong-Petit (Fig. 6.3). According to Debye, the
isochoric molar heat capacity of a harmonic solid behaves as

(6.15)
The parameter D, called the Debye temperature, is a characteristic of the solid
and is related to the normal frequencies of vibration of the solid. Usually, these
frequencies are affected by variations of the distances Rij between equilibrium
positions of atoms. This can be understood if we examine the coefﬁcients of the
quadratic terms of the expansion of the potential energy in the deviations of atoms
from their equilibrium positions. These coefﬁcients generally depend on Rij. As the
normal frequencies are obtained from the coefﬁcients of second order, then they
depend on the distances Rij. On the other hand, the distances Rij are proportional
to v1=3, from which follows that the normal frequencies and therefore D, depend
on the molar volume v. Only for an ideal harmonic solid, for which the second
order coefﬁcients are independent of the volume, the normal frequencies and D
are independent of the volume.
The Debye temperature is related to the velocity of propagation of elastic waves

(6.16)
From the experimental measurement of cv at low temperatures, we obtain the
coefﬁcient a and from this coefﬁcient we may obtain D by (6.15). Experimental
values of D for several solids obtained in this manner are shown in Table 6.1.
The Debye temperature obtained by this method can then be compared with that
obtained from the velocity of elastic waves by the use of formula (6.16).
The Debye theory is valid for solids with harmonic interactions. At low tem-
peratures one expects that the harmonic approximation is reasonable, considering
that the atoms perform small oscillations in this regime, so that the law (6.11) is
in fact obeyed at low temperatures. At high temperatures, anharmonic terms of the
interatomic interactions become important and deviations from the Debye theory, in
this regime, and from the Dulong-Petit law, begin to be observed.

Nernst-Planck Principle
It is important to note also that some solids have very high Debye temperatures
such that the regime of the Dulong-Petit law is not reached at room temperature.
This is the case of diamond whose Debye temperature is 2,230 K, well above room
temperature. We also note that some solids melt before the regime of the Dulong-
Petit law is reached.
6.2.3
Thermal Expansion
The thermal expansion ˛ of solids is related, as we will see, to the Gr¨uneisen
coefﬁcient G, deﬁned by
G D d ln D
d ln v :
(6.17)
To determine ˛, we use the relation ˛=T D .@p=@T /v and the Maxwell relation

follows
˛ D cv
v T G:
(6.21)
It is worth noting that for an ideal harmonic solid, G D 0 because D is
independent of the volume, so that ˛ D 0 and therefore cp D cv.
Assuming that the compressibility T is weakly dependent on the temperature
and remembering that G is independent of T , we may conclude that the ratio ˛=cv
is independent of the temperature from which follows that ˛ has the same behavior
of cv. Therefore, in the regime where the Dulong-Petit law is valid, ˛ is constant. In
this regime, the relation (6.8) implies that the molar isobaric heat capacity cp has a

6.2
Heat Capacity of Solids
91
correction proportional to temperature. In the regime of low temperatures, ˛ must
have the behavior
˛ D bT3:
(6.22)
This result together with the relation (6.8) implies that the difference between cp
and cv at low temperatures is of the order T 7, what justiﬁes to say that cp has the
same behavior as cv in this regime.
6.2.4
Metals
Metals are characterized by electrical conduction, resulting from the mobility of
valence electrons of atoms. These electrons contribute to the heat capacity of solid,
adding to the heat capacity of the lattice described by the Debye theory. Assuming
that the free electrons behave like an ideal gas, we would expect an electronic
contribution equal to 3R=2 for the molar heat capacity at least for high temperatures,
a value that is half the contribution of the crystal lattice. But, the metals at room
temperature show no discrepancy in the heat capacity, when compared with an
insulator, which could be attributed to the electrons.
According to Sommerfeld, the electronic heat capacity behaves linearly with the
temperature in accordance with
cv D 2

(6.23)
where F is the Fermi temperature given by
F D
„2
2mkB
32
v ne
2=3
(6.24)
where m is the mass of the electron and ne is the number of electrons per mole.
The result (6.23) is valid at low temperatures, more precisely at temperatures
much smaller than the Fermi temperature. However, given that the Fermi tem-
perature of metals is greater than 104 K, we can use the result (6.23) to room
temperature and concluded that the electronic contribution to the heat is negligible
when compared to the contribution of the crystal lattice.
To observe experimentally the electronic contribution we should consider tem-
peratures much lower than the Debye temperature, in which case the two contribu-
tions have the same order of magnitude. Thus, in this regime, the behavior of the
heat capacity of metals is given by
cv D T C aT3;

Planck Postulate
6.3.1
Entropy
According to the Nernst postulate, the molar entropy s of a system approaches
a ﬁnite value s0 in the limit T ! 0 and that, moreover, s0 is independent of
thermodynamic variables, that is, a constant. One could imagine this constant as a
characteristic of the substance and, therefore, different for each substance. However,
Planck postulated that s0 has the same value for any substance in thermodynamic
equilibrium then assigning the value zero to the entropy at absolute zero. Therefore,
the Nernst postulate together with the Planck postulate, which we call the Nernst-
Planck principle or the third law of thermodynamics, tells us that
s.T / ! 0
when
T ! 0;
(6.32)
for any substance in thermodynamic equilibrium.
To verify the Planck postulate we must deﬁne a reference state whose entropy
sR is known. Next, we determine the entropy difference s between the reference
state and the ground state. Since the entropy of the ground state is zero then we
must have sR D s. In general, the reference state is considered to be a gas at

high temperatures and low densities, so that it can be considered an ideal gas. Let
us ﬁrst examine how to determine s. Subsequently, we examine the entropy of the
reference state.
Consider for simplicity an isobaric process that takes a system composed by
a pure substance from one state at sufﬁciently low temperature to the reference
state. In this process the system undergoes the transition from solid to liquid, from
liquid to gas, and possible transitions between different crystalline states. In each
transition, occurring at a well deﬁned temperature, the system gains entropy which is
equal to the latent heat divided by the transition temperature. From the experimental
data of the heat capacity cp and latent heats qi of each transition, the entropy
difference s between the reference state and the ground state is determined by

Table 6.2 shows the values of the several terms of the entropy of xenon, obtained
from the experimental data of the heat capacity of solid and liquid xenon at the
pressure of 1 atm, and from the fusion and boiling latent heats. Under the pressure
of 1 atm xenon undergoes a solid-liquid transition at the temperature of 161.3K and
a liquid-gas transition at the temperature of 165.13K. The melting latent heat is
2.293kJ/mol and the boiling latent heat is 12.62 kJ/mol. Between 0 and 10 K the
entropy is estimated by using the Debye law assuming D D 55 K. According
to Table 6.2, the difference in entropy between xenon in the vapor state, under
the pressure of 1 atm at the boiling temperature, and the solid xenon, at zero
temperature, is s D 157:4 J/mol K.
6.3.2
Ideal Gases
In the regime of low densities, the average distance between gas molecules is large
enough so that the interaction between them can be neglected. Thus, in this regime,
the gas obeys the equation of state of ideal gas pv D RT and the internal energy

6.3
Planck Postulate

u depends only on temperature. As a result, cv D .@u=@T /v depends only on
temperature and the relation between cp and cv becomes simply cp D cv C R
since cp D .@h=@T /p and h D u C pv D u C RT.
If the interaction between molecules is negligible, it sufﬁces to consider the
motion of molecules in isolation. The movement of a molecule is composed of
translation, rotation and vibration and other movements that we will not consider
here. The translation motion is always independent of the other types of motion. The
rotation and vibration of the molecules are in general interdependent movements.
However, the separation into independent motions constitutes a good approxima-
tion. Thus, we assume that the thermodynamic potential of an ideal gas is equal to
the sum of three terms corresponding to the three types of motions. The isochoric
heat capacity is therefore a sum of three terms
cv D ctrans C crot C cvib:
(6.34)
Similarly, the entropy will be the sum of three terms
s D strans C srot C svib:
(6.35)
We assume that each type of motion is characterized by a certain energy value
below which the movement is frozen and the corresponding degrees of freedom
suppressed. Thus, we introduce the characteristic energy of each type of motion,
which we denote by trans, rot and vib. It is convenient to deﬁne the characteristic
temperatures t D trans=kB, r D rot=kB and v D vib=kB. Extending the
Nernst-Planck principle to each type of motion, we conclude that the heat capacity
and the entropy associated to a particular type of movement vanish at temperatures
well below the corresponding characteristic temperature.
In general, the characteristic temperatures are such that
t << r << v:
(6.36)
Table 6.3 shows values of the characteristic temperatures of rotation and vibration of
some gases. Therefore, as the temperature of the gas is decreasing, the vibrational,
rotational and translational modes will be successively removed. This can be seen
in Fig. 5.3, where we present the molar heat capacity at constant pressure of several
gases. We must remark however that in general the gases condense long before the
regime where T < t could be reached. Equivalently, we can say that the gases are
usually found in the regime T >> t.
To determine the characteristic energy of translation t, we use the relation p D
h=
 between the moment of a molecule and its de Broglie wavelength 
, where h is
the Planck constant. The corresponding kinetic energy is p2=2m D h2=2m
2. The
lowest energy, identiﬁed as trans, is given by the largest value of 
, that we consider
to be equal to the distance between gas molecules, that is, 
 D .Nv/1=3, where Nv is
the volume per molecule. That is, trans D h2=2m.Nv/2=3 so that

6.3.3
Sackur-Tetrode Formula
The translational part of the molar heat capacity of an ideal gas is cv D .3=2/R
because each molecule has three translational degrees of freedom. If the ideal
gas is monoatomic this is the only contribution to the heat capacity. Using the
relation .@s=@T /v D cv=T D 3R=2T and taking into account that .@s=@v/T D
.@p=@T /v D R=v, we reach the following expression for the molar entropy of an
ideal gas
s D Rf3
2 ln T C ln Nv C ag;
(6.38)

6.3
Planck Postulate
97
where Nv D v=NA is the volume per molecule, NA is the Avogadro constant and a is
a constant, independent of T and v.
The constant a must depend only on the characteristic of the gas with respect
to the translational kinetic energy. In this sense, the constant a depends solely on
the mass of the molecules, which is the parameter associated to the translational
kinetic energy. Sackur assumed that a depends on the mass m of the gas molecules
in accordance with
a D 3

the semi-classical theory is given by

(6.42)
recalling that t depends on Nv.
The determination of the entropy through the Sackur-Tetrode formula enables us
to verify the Planck postulate for substances that turn into monoatomic ideal gas at
high temperatures. To this end it sufﬁces to compare s, obtained by Sackur-Tetrode
formula with s obtained from equation (6.33). As an example, we determine the
entropy of vapor xenon in coexistence with its liquid at the pressure of 1 atm.
Formula (6.41) provides the following value for the absolute molar entropy s D
157:3 J/mol K, which should be compared with that obtained from equation (6.33),
shown in Table 6.2.
We remark that an ideal gas of diatomic or polyatomic molecules can behave as
a monoatomic gas, that is, as a gas having only translational degrees of freedom if it
can be found in the regime where T << r. However, the diatomic and polyatomic
gases in general are found in the opposite regime, where T >> r. An exception
is hydrogen, which remains in the gaseous state even at temperatures below the
characteristic temperature of rotation r D 85:3 K. In this regime, the molar heat
capacity cv of H2 approaches the value .3=2/R, corresponding to a monoatomic gas,
as shown in Fig. 5.3.

Rotational Modes
For temperatures well above r, the molar heat capacity of gases composed by
linear diatomic or polyatomic molecules is given by
crot D R;
(6.43)
because such molecules have only two rotational degrees of freedom. The rotational
molar entropy has, therefore, the form
srot D Rf1
2 ln T C a0g;
(6.44)
where a0 is a constant. This constant must depend on the characteristic of the gas
with respect to the rotation motion. In this sense, the constant a0 must depend on
the moment of inertia I of the linear molecule, which is the parameter associated to
rotation.
A semi-classical calculation leads us to the following expression

that the oscillations are harmonic. For a gas of diatomic molecules, the vibrational

Result (6.52) was obtained originally by Einstein for the heat capacity of solids
assuming that they oscillate with the same frequency.
Polyatomic molecules in general have various modes of vibration, each one
associated to a natural frequency. The vibrational entropy and heat capacity of
polyatomic gases are determined in a manner similar to that of the diatomic gases.
For each normal mode of oscillation of the molecule, we add to the molar entropy a
term equal to (6.51) and, to the molar heat capacity, a term equal to (6.52). The term
corresponding to the normal mode of frequency i must contain the characteristic

6.3.6
Residual Entropy of Ice
At the pressure of 1 atm, water freezes at 0 ıC becoming a crystalline solid, that we
call ice. A way of determining the absolute entropy s0 of ice at zero temperature
consists in calculating the difference in entropy s between the state at zero
temperature and a reference state, which we choose as the vapor in coexistence
with water at the pressure of 1 atm and temperature of 373.15 K. Table 6.4 shows
the variations of entropy of ice and water, obtained from the experimental data for
the heat capacity, presented in Fig. 6.6.
The integral of cp=T for ice gives 38.05 J/mol K and for the liquid, 23.49 J/mol K.
The melting latent heat of ice is 6.006 kJ/mol, so that the entropy at the ice-
water transition increases by 22.00 J/mol K. The boiling latent heat of water
is 40.660kJ/mol, so that the entropy at the water-vapor transition increases by
108.96J/mol K. Therefore, the difference between the molar ice entropy at 0 K and
the vapor at 1 atm is s D 192:50 J/mol K, as long as no other transition takes
places in addition to the ones mentioned.
The molar entropy sR of the reference state, which we assumed to be that of
an ideal gas, is determined from the formulas for the translational, rotational and
vibrational. The translational entropy gives the result strans D 149:33. To determine
the rotational entropy we use the rotational characteristic temperatures of H2O
presented in Table 6.3. We obtain the following result srot D 46:50 J/mol K. The
vibrational contribution to the entropy is small. From the data of Table 6.3 we
obtain the value svib D 0:12 J/mol K. Therefore, the entropy of water vapor is
sR D 195:95 J/mol K.
From the values obtained above, we see that ice has a residual entropy s0 D
sRs D 3:45 J/mol K, in apparent contradiction with the Nernst-Planck principle.
The contradiction disappears if we assume, for example, that at low temperatures ice
ﬁnds itself in a metastable state. In fact, in this regime one observes experimentally
another more stable solid phase, called ice XI, whose crystalline structure is distinct
from ordinary ice. The transition between the ordinary ice, called ice I, and ice XI
occurs at 72 K, with a decrease of entropy.
Pauling considers that the hydrogen bonds existing in the ice structure have a
fundamental role in the explanation of the residual entropy. A hydrogen bond binds

atoms of oxygen belonging to different molecules and the hydrogen, actually a
hydrogen ion, may be found next to one or the other oxygen atom, that is, in one
of two possible positions. Since the number of hydrogen bonds is equal to twice
the number n of molecules then the number of microscopic state W D wn would
be such that w D 4. However, this value is overestimated because each oxygen
ion must have only two hydrogen ions in its neighborhood. Taking into account
this restriction, we see that, of the 16 possible arrangements of hydrogen ions
around an oxygen ion, only 6 can be accomplished, what leads to the Pauling result
w D 4.6=16/ D 3=2. Using the statistical interpretation of entropy, S D kB ln W ,
this approximate calculation gives the following residual molar entropy s0=R D
ln.3=2/, that is, s0 D 3:371 J/mol K. A more correct counting of the microscopic
arrangements leads us to the result obtained by Nagle, w D 1:5069, that is, s0 D
3:409 J/mol K, in accordance with the observed value, s0 D 3:45 ˙ 0:20 J/mol K,
taking into account the experimental errors.
We remark ﬁnally that ice XI, in contrast to the ordinary ice, has a crystalline
structure such that the hydrogen ions are ordered resulting in zero entropy at T D 0.

7.1
Pure Substance
7.1.1
State of Matter
A substance may occur in different states of aggregation. At high temperatures and
low pressures it occurs in gaseous form. At low temperatures and high pressures, it
occurs in solid form. At intermediate temperatures and pressures, it may be a liquid.
A gas is characterized by its high compressibility and low density. A solid and a
liquid, in contrast, are less compressible, and have moderate or high densities. A
solid, contrary to a liquid, offers resistance to deformation.
At the microscopic level the states of matter are characterized by the form of
aggregation of the molecules that make up the substance. Either as a liquid or a gas
the molecules are very mobile and therefore are spatially disordered. However, the
mobility of the molecules and the average distance between molecules in a gas are
much larger. In a solid, on the other hand, the mobility is greatly reduced and the
movement of the molecules is only local, enabling the regular spatial structures of
molecules, which characterize the crystalline solids. A solid material may have one
or more crystalline structures.
In addition to these three states of aggregation of matter, other states may arise
in substances composed of more complex molecules. For example, liquid crystals
consist of long molecules favoring the emergence of a state, called nematic, which
has orientational order but is devoid of spatial order. We must also mention the glass,
traditionally made by the rapid cooling of fused silica. Although a solid material,
glass and other amorphous materials do not have the regular structural found in
crystalline solids. But, the glassy state is not a state of thermodynamic equilibrium
and therefore will not be the subject of our study.

Phase Transition
7.1.2
Thermodynamic Phases
A homogeneous system, that is, completely uniform with regard to speciﬁc prop-
erties, constitutes a thermodynamic phase. From the microscopic point of view, the
molecules that comprise a thermodynamicphase are in the same type of aggregation.
The gaseous state, the liquid state and the various crystalline states are possible
thermodynamic phases of a system. A system may also be heterogeneous, that
is, display simultaneously two or more thermodynamic phases. In this case, if the
system is in equilibrium, we are facing a coexistence of phases.
The phenomenon of phase coexistence is particularly useful in determining the
purity of a substance. Suppose that a system consisting of two phases in coexistence
receive heat at constant pressure. In this process, one phase grows at the expenses
of the other which decreases. If the system consists of a pure substance, the
temperature remains unchanged as long as there are phases in coexistence. Thus,
for a given pressure, the transition between two phases of a pure substance occurs
at a well deﬁned temperature.
From the microscopic point of view, a pure substance consists of a single type
of atom (simple substance) or a single type of molecule (composite substance). As
an example, distilled water, formed by molecules of H2O. Many minerals consist of
pure or nearly pure substances such as diamond and graphite, which are different
crystalline forms of carbon (C), and quartz, consisting almost exclusively of silica
(SiO2).
7.1.3
Phase Diagram
The various thermodynamic phases of a pure substance are represented in a
pressure-temperature diagram, called phase diagram. The different phases are repre-
sented by regions. The coexistence of two thermodynamic phases is represented by
a line in the diagram since, for a given pressure, the coexistence of two phases must
occur at a well deﬁned temperature and not in a range of temperatures. Two lines of
coexistence may meet. The meeting point of coexistence lines is a triple point, that
is, the point of coexistence of three phases. The liquid-vapor coexisting line always
ends in a point, called critical point, where the liquid and vapor become indistinct.
Figure 7.1 shows the phase diagram of pure water (H2O). At a pressure of 1 atm
(101,325Pa), ice and water coexist at a temperature of 0 ıC (273:15 K). At the same
pressure, water and vapor coexist at a temperature of 100 ıC (373:15K). Heating
water, at the pressure of 1 atm, from the room temperature, its temperature will
increase to the point where it starts to boil when reaching 100 ıC. While boiling, its
temperature remains unchanged. The temperature will rise again only when all water
has been evaporated. Similarly, if we remove heat of a certain amount of water at a
pressure of 1 atm, starting from the room temperature, its temperature will decrease
until reaching 0 ıC when it starts to freeze. While water is being transformed into

ice, the temperature remains unchanged and will decrease only when all water has
been transformed into ice.
The line of coexistence of water and its vapor has a positive slope which means
that at pressures lower than 1 atm boiling occurs at lower temperatures. In places of
high altitudes, where the atmospheric air pressure is lower, the water boils at lower
temperatures. At pressures higher than 1 atm, water boils at temperatures higher than
100 ıC, which is the working principle of pressure cookers. At still higher pressures,
the line of coexistence of water-vapor eventually ends at a critical point, where
water and steam become indistinct, which happens at the pressure of 22:06 MPa
(217.7atm) and at temperature of 374:00 ıC (647:15K), as shown if Fig. 7.1. The
line of coexistence of ice-water has a negative slope, in contrast to most substances,
whose lines of coexistence solid-liquid have positive slope. Decreasing the pressure,
the melting temperature slightly increases. The two lines of transition, ice-water
and water-vapor, meet at the triple point that occurs at the pressure of 611:7 Pa
(0.006037atm) and at the temperature of 0:01 ıC (273:16 K).
Figure 7.2 shows the phase diagram of carbon dioxide (CO2). The triple point
occurs at a temperature of 56:57 ıC (216:58 K) and at the pressure of 0:518 MPa
(5:11 atm). As the pressure of the triple point is greater than 1 atm, the carbon
dioxide does not exist in the liquid state at a pressure of 1 atm. At this pressure,

the solid carbon dioxide passes directly to the gaseous state at a temperature of
78:45 ıC (194:7 K), a phenomenon known as sublimation. However, it is possible
to obtain liquid carbon dioxide, for example, at the temperature of 20 ıC, increasing
the pressure to 5:73 MPa (56:5 atm). The critical point of CO2 occurs at the
temperature of 30:99 ıC (304:14K) and at the pressure of 7:375 MPa (72:79 atm).

7.2.1
Densities and Fields
For a pure substance, the fundamental relation in the energy representation is
constituted by the internal energy U.S; V; N / as function of entropy S, volume V
and number of moles N of the substance. As the internal energy is extensive,
it is possible to describe the thermodynamic properties of a pure substance by
the molar internal energy of u.s; v/ as a function of the molar entropy s and the
molar volume v. The fundamental relation is recovered by means of U.S; V; N / D
Nu.S=N; V=N /. Performing the Legendre transformations starting from u.s; v/, we
obtain the molar potentials f .T; v/, h.s; p/ and g.T; p/ which describe equivalently
the thermodynamic properties of a pure substance.
The variables such as temperature and pressure are known as thermodynamic
ﬁelds while others, such as the molar entropy and molar volume, are known as
thermodynamic density. In a state of thermodynamic equilibrium all parts of a
system will have the same value for each one of the ﬁelds. If the system is
homogeneous (one thermodynamic phase), not only the ﬁelds but densities have the
same values. In a heterogeneous system (coexistence of one or more thermodynamic
phase) on the other hand, while the ﬁelds have the same values for each phase, the
density will have different values.
We state below the fundamental properties of the molar thermodynamic poten-
tials u.s; v/, f .T; v/, h.s; p/ and g.T; p/, with respect to their thermodynamic
space. Let  one of these potentials and ˝ the respective thermodynamic space.
Then:
(a)  is a continuous function of all variables of ˝;
(b)  is differentiable with respect to the densities of ˝; or, equivalently, a
thermodynamic ﬁeld obtained by differentiation of  is a continuous function
of all variable of ˝;
(c)  is a convex function of the densities of ˝ and a concave function of the ﬁelds
of ˝;
(d)  is analytic function inside a one-phase region of ˝.
The following formulas allows us to obtain the equation of state from each one
of the molar thermodynamic potential:

7.2.2
Volume Change
Suppose that a pure substance in the liquid state is in coexistence with its vapor
whose pressure is kept constant while receiving a certain amount of heat. The heat
introduced transforms part of the liquid into vapor thus increasing the total volume
of the liquid-vapor system. In this process the temperature remains unchanged as
long as the phases are in coexistence. Moreover, considering that each phase is ho-
mogeneous, the densities of the liquid and of the vapor are well deﬁned and remain
invariant. That is, the molar volume of the liquid vL and the molar volume of the
vapor vV remain invariant. The volume change is caused by the transformation of the
liquid, which has smaller molar volume, into vapor, which has greater molar volume.
If a certain number of mole N of the liquid is transformed into vapor, the
variation in volume will be V D NvG  NvL, where vG D 1= NG and vL D 1= NL
are the molar volumes of the vapor and liquid, respectively. Therefore, the variation
v D V=N , corresponding to the transformation of 1 mole of the substance in the
liquid state into vapor, is equal to the difference between the molar volumes of vapor
and liquid, that is, v D vG  vL. Table 7.1 presents the speciﬁc volumes of liquid
and vapor at the transition, at the pressure of 1 atm, of various pure substances.
Suppose that a certain quantity of gas is compressed isothermally. Figure 7.3c
shows the representation of this process. The volume of the gas decreases and the
pressure increases to the point that the vapor begins to condense. From this point,
the decrease in volume does not change the pressure, known as the vapor pressure,
until the condensation is complete when the pressure then increases again.
The transition from one phase to another along an isotherm is represented
by a horizontal straight line in the p  v diagram because the pressure remains
unchanged. The end points of the segment have coordinates .vL; p/ and .vG; p/,
where p is the vapor pressure. These two end points represent the thresholds of the
liquid-vapor coexistence and the line segment that joins them is called the tie line.

Given any point .v; p/ on the tie line we can determine the fraction in number
of moles of each phase. The volume occupied by the liquid is VL D vLNL and
by the vapor is VG D vGNG, where NL and NG are the number of moles of the
liquid and vapor, respectively. The fractions in number of mole are rL D NL=N
and rG D NG=N , where N D NL C NG is the total number of moles. Therefore,
V D VL C VG D vLrLN C vGrGN , so that v D V=N is given by
v D vLrL C vGrG;
(7.7)
which is the lever rule. Since rL C rG D 1, we can then obtain from it the fractions

Therefore, the fraction in number of moles of one phase is proportional do the
distance between the point considered and the end point of the tie line corresponding
to the other phase.
7.2.3
Latent Heat
Let us suppose again that a pure substance in the liquid state is in coexistence with
its vapor, whose pressure is kept constant while receiving a certain amount of heat.
The heat introduced transforms part of the liquid into vapor without changing the
temperature. The number of moles of the substance in the liquid state that turns
into vapor is proportional to the heat introduced Le, called boiling latent heat. The
amount of heat `e D Le=N required to evaporate 1 mole of the liquid is called
molar boiling latent heat. Table 7.1 shows the speciﬁc latent heat of several pure
substances corresponding to the liquid-vapor transition at pressure of 1 atm.
Taking into account that each phase is homogeneous, each have a well-deﬁned
molar entropy, which remains invariant if the pressure is kept constant and as long

plots (a) and (b) form a pair of functions related by a Legendre transformation whereas (c) and (d)

as there is coexistence. Denoting by sL the molar entropy of the liquid and by sG
that of the vapor, then the increase in entropy corresponding to the transformation
of N moles of liquid into vapor will be S D NsG  NsL. Because this process
is isothermal, then the change in entropy is equal to the heat introduced divided by
the temperature so that Le D T S, where T  is the temperature of coexistence.
Therefore, the molar latent heat is related to the change in molar entropy s D
sG  sL by `e D T s.
In the T s diagram, the phase transition along an isobaric line is also represented
by a tie line between the points .sL; T / and .sG; T /, which indicate the threshold
of liquid-vapor coexistence, as shown in Fig. 7.4. For a point .s; T /, the lever rule

Phase Transition
The phase transition, in the diagram of Helmholtz free energy versus volume, is
represented by an inclined line segment whose slope is equal to p because p D
@f=@v, as shown in Fig. 7.3a. In the range vL  v  vG the free energy f D
.NLfL C NGfG/=N is the weighted average of fL and fG, that is,
f .T; v/ D vG  v
vG  vL
f .T; vL/ C v  vL
vG  vL

vG  vL
f .T; vG/:
(7.12)
Inverting the plot of p versus v, we get the plot of v versus p, shown in Fig. 7.3d.
In this case the transition is represented by a jump in the molar volume, equal to
v D vG  vL, at the vapor pressure p D p. Taking into account that v D @g=@p,
the phase transition is represented, in the diagram of Gibbs free energy versus
pressure, by a point whose derivatives at left and at right are distinct, as shown
in Fig. 7.3b.
Similarly, the phase transition, in the diagram of enthalpy versus entropy, is
represented by an inclined line segment because T D @h=@s. In the range sL 
s  sG the enthalpy h D .NLhL C NGhG/=N is the weighted average of hL and hG,
that is,

The slope is equal to the temperature of coexistence T  at the pressure p, as
shown in Fig. 7.4a. Inverting the plot T versus s, shown in Fig. 7.4c, we get the plot
of s versus T , shown if Fig. 7.4d. The phase transition is represented by a jump in
the molar entropy equal to s D sG  sL D `e=T  that occurs at the temperature
T D T . Taking into account that s D @g=@T , the phase transition is represented,
in the Gibbs free energy versus temperature, by a point whose derivatives at left and
right are different, as seen in Fig. 7.4b.
The graphs presented in Figs. 7.3 and 7.4 correspond to the isothermal and
isobaric processes, respectively. In the T  p diagram, these processes correspond
to straight lines parallel to the axis T and p, that intersect at the point .T ; p/.
At this point, where the phase transition occurs, the molar volume and the molar
entropy present a jump. If we imagine other processes corresponding to trajectories
in the phase diagram that intersect the liquid-vapor transition line at the same point

112

Phase Transition
.T ; p/, the jump in v will be the same because vG and vL depend only on the
point on the coexistence line. Similarly, the jump in s as well as the molar boiling
latent heat `e will be the same because sG, sL and `e depend only on the point on the
coexistence line.
The phase transition just described, where the molar volume and molar entropy
present a jump when one crosses the coexistence line in the T  p diagram is called
discontinuous or ﬁrst-order phase transition.
7.2.5
Clausius-Clapeyron Equation
Consider two nearby points A0 and B0 in the region corresponding to the liquid
phase in the T  p diagram. The difference in the molar Gibbs free energy g0
between these two points is given by
g0 D sLT C vLp;
(7.15)
since they are close together, where sL and vL are the molar entropy and the molar
volume of the liquid phase and T and p are the difference in temperature and
pressure, respectively, between the two points. Similarly, consider another pair of
nearby points A00 and B00 in the region corresponding to the gas phase such that the
differences in temperature and pressure of these two points are also T and p.
The difference in the molar Gibbs free energy g00 between these two points are
g00 D sGT C vGp;
(7.16)
since the two points are close together, where sG and vG are the molar entropy and
molar volume of the gas phase.
Imagine now two points A and B on the coexistence line such that the difference
in temperature and pressure between these points are also T and p. Suppose
next that the points A0 and A00 approach the point A. As a consequence, B0 and B00
will approach the point B. Since the Gibbs free energy is a continuous function of
T and p, then g00 D g0 so that

dp

`e
T .vG  vL/;
(7.20)
where `e D T .sG  sL/ is the molar boiling latent heat and T is the transition
temperature.
The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the slope of the coexistence in the pT
diagram with the discontinuities of entropy and volume when passing from one
phase to another. For the liquid-vapor transition, sG > sL because the gas phase
occur always at a temperature higher than that of the liquid phase and vG > vL
because the gas always has a molar volume greater than that of the liquid. Therefore
dp=dT > 0 from which we conclude that the liquid-vapor coexistence curve has a
positive slope in the p  T diagram.
The Clausius-Clapeyron equation may also be used to demonstrate that the tie
lines in the volume-entropy diagram are perpendicular to the coexistence line as
illustrated in Fig. 7.5b. Consider a portion of the coexistence line in the pressure-
temperature diagram as shown in Fig. 7.5a. Consider also the volume-entropy
diagram constructed so that the axis s is parallel to the axis T and the axis v is
antiparallel to the axis p. In this diagram we locate the point L = .sL; vL/ and the
point G = .sG; vG/, corresponding to the liquid and vapor coexisting at the point O
of the p  T diagram. Next we perform a translation of the coexistence line from
the pressure-temperature diagram into the volume-entropy diagram. The slope of
the segment LG is 
 D .vG  vL/=.sL  sG/ and the slope of the coexistence line
is given for dp=dT. But according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation dp=dT D
1=
, which is the condition of perpendicularity. Therefore, the tie line LG is
perpendicular to the coexistence line at the point O.
The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is valid not only for the transition between the
liquid and vapor but for the transition between any two phases. For the solid-liquid

molar volume, vL > vS. In these case, therefore, dp=dT > 0 and the solid-liquid
coexistence line has a positive slope in the pT diagram, as can be seen in Fig. 7.2.
An important exception to this general case is the water. As is well known, at the
pressure of 1 atm, the ice ﬂoats over the water, which means that the density of ice is
smaller than the density of water, that is, S < L or in an equivalent way vS > vL.
Therefor dp=dT < 0 and the water-ice coexistence line has a negative slope in the
p  T diagram, as seen in Fig. 7.1. However, there are other crystalline forms of ice
that are denser that water, which turns the slope of the coexistence line positive. The
substances whose solid phase is less dense than the liquid phase include, in addition
to water, bismuth, silicon, germanium and gallium.
The Clausius-Clapeyron equation can also describe the solid-vapor coexistence.

(7.22)
where `s D T .sG  sS/ is the molar sublimation latent heat and T is the transition
temperature. In sublimation, sG
> sS because the vapor always occurs at a
temperature higher than that of the solid. Moreover, since vG > vS, then dp=dT > 0
from which we conclude that the sublimation line has a positive slope. At the
pressure of 1 atm, some substance pass directly from solid to vapor. Table 7.3
presents some example, that include the carbon dioxide and graphite.
7.2.6
Triple Point
Most triple point corresponds to the coexistence of the three phases solid, liquid
and vapor. Such a point, for a pure substance, occurs at a unique temperature and
pressure since the triple point is the meeting of three lines of coexistence, liquid-
vapor, solid-liquid and solid-vapor. Table 7.4 shows the temperature and pressure
corresponding to the triple point of several pure substances. At the triple point the
latent heat are related by

At the triple point, the three lines of coexistence meet forming angles always
smaller than 180ı. In an equivalent manner, we may say that the extension of the line
beyond the triple point will be found inside the region between the other two lines
of coexistence. To show this rule we proceed as follows. In a system of coordinates
consisting by the temperature and pressure, we locate the triple point .Tt; pt/ and the
three lines of coexistence, as shown in Fig. 7.6a. In another system of coordinates,
set up in such a way that the molar entropy axis is parallel to the temperature and the
molar volume axis is antiparallel to the pressure, we locate the points S D .vS; sS/,
L D .vL; sL/ and G D .vG; sG/, determined by the molar volumes and molar
entropies of the three phases in coexistence. The segments SL, LG and SG constitute
tie lines related to the three transitions. Next we perform a translation of the three
lines of coexistence and of the triple point to the volume-entropy diagram, so that
the triple point is place inside the triangle SLG, as seen in Fig. 7.6b.
Each line of coexistence, starting from inside the triangle SLG intercepts one of
the sides of the triangle. The lines of coexistence solid-liquid OB, liquid-vapor OA
and solid-vapor OC intercept the respective tie lines SL, LG and SG. The intercep-
tions occur at right angles because, as we have seen, the tie line is perpendicular
to the coexistence line. Since the angle formed by two lines of coexistence, which

Problems
7.1. Determine the liquid-vapor transition line of a substance whose molar boiling
latent heat `e is independent of temperature. Assume that the vapor behaves as an
ideal gas and that the vapor molar volume is much greater than the molar liquid
volume. Solve the same problem for the case in which the latent heat depends on
temperature in accordance with `e D a C .b=T /.
7.2. In the neighborhood of the triple point, the liquid-vapor and the solid-vapor
transition lines are described by ln.p=a1/ D b1=T and ln.p=a2/ D b2=T ,
respectively. Determine the pressure and temperature of the triple point and the
boiling, melting and sublimation latent heats around this point.
7.3. In the neighborhood of the solid-liquid transition the molar Helmholtz free
energies of the solid and liquid are given by
fS D RT ln.v  b1/ C c1;

Criticality
8.1
Critical Point
8.1.1
Liquid-Vapor Critical Point
Walking along the liquid-vapor coexistence line of a pure substance into direction
of high pressures and high temperatures, the vapor density increases and the liquid
density decreases to the point where the densities of the two phases become equal.
This point which determines the end of the coexistence line and corresponds to the
state in which the two phases become the identical, is called the critical point.
The ﬁrst experimental observations of liquid-vapor critical point were made in
alcohol, benzene and ether by Cagniard de La Tour. The critical point of these
substances and of others, such as water, which are liquid at room temperature and
at the pressure of 1 atm, can be experimentally achieved in two steps. At ﬁrst, the
coexistence line is reached by heating the liquid at constant pressure to the boiling
point. Once on the transition line, the substance may be brought to the critical point
by conﬁning the liquid and its vapor in sealed vessel, followed by an increase in
temperature.
Increasing the temperature, the vapor-liquid system will necessarily be found on
the coexistence line, unless one of the two phases disappear, which may happen
before the critical point is reached. However, if the liquid-vapor system is prepared
so that the number of moles divided by the total volume of the vessel equals the
critical density, then the critical point is necessarily reached.
If we use this method to reach the critical point, we see that initially the meniscus
between liquid and vapor is well deﬁned. As we approach the critical point, the
meniscus becomes less deﬁned and disappears at the critical point. The region where
the meniscus was located becomes quite white, meaning that the light scattering is
very intense. This phenomenon, known as critical opalescence, is caused by large
ﬂuctuations in density that occur around the critical point.

Criticality
In the phase diagram, the critical point .Tc; pc/ lies therefore in the terminal point
of the liquid-vapor coexistence line. Near the critical point the coexistence line is
represented by the semi-straight line
p  pc D A.T  Tc/;
T < Tc;
(8.1)
where A is a constant strictly positive which is identiﬁed as .@p=@T /v calculated at
the critical point. Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we see that the differences
in molar entropy and molar volume in both phases in coexistence are related by
.sG  sL/ D A.vG  vL/:
(8.2)
Therefore, at the critical point, not only the molar volumes vG and vL become iden-
tical, but the molar entropies sG and sL become identical as well and, consequently,
the boiling latent heat `e vanishes.
8.1.2
Liquefaction
Most pure substances that are gases under normal conditions of temperature and
pressure can be liqueﬁed by compression alone, that is, can pass into the liquid state
when subjected isothermally to sufﬁciently high pressures. This occurs with carbon
dioxide, ammonia, ethane, propane, butane and other gases. These substances have
a critical temperature higher than the room temperature, so that the coexistence
line can be reached by isothermal compression. Carbon dioxide, for example,
can be liqueﬁed at a temperature of 20 ıC under the pressure of 5.73 MPa. Other
gases, on the other hand, such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane cannot be liqueﬁed at room
temperature, no matter how large the applied pressure. These substances have
critical temperatures below the room temperature. A compression alone at room
temperature is insufﬁcient to meet the liquid-vapor coexisting line.
Figure 8.1 shows the carbon dioxide isotherms at various temperatures above
and below the critical temperature, which occurs at 31.04 ıC. It is seen that, below
the critical temperature, the vapor-liquid coexistence may occur and therefore
liquefaction may happen by compression alone. Along a subcritical isotherm, the
volume decreases by compression and presents a jump at the transition. Along a
supercritical isotherm, the volume increases continuously with pressure, without any
discontinuity. The critical point is reached by compression alone along the critical
isotherm when pressures reaches 72.85 atm. The density of the carbon dioxide at the
critical point, where the liquid and vapor become identical, is 0.468g/cm 3. The ﬁrst
experimental measurements around a critical point were made in carbon dioxide by
Andrews, who proved to be possible to continuously convert steam into liquid and
vice-versa, bypassing the critical point through an appropriate path.

van der Waals Equation
van der Waals theory provides a quantitative description of the liquid-vapor phase
transition and of the corresponding critical point. Although it does not describe
accurately the behavior of the thermodynamic properties near the critical point it
provides an appropriate description of the phase coexistence and its relation with
the critical point.
The van der Waals equation is given by
p D RT
v  b  a
v2 ;
(8.3)
where a and b are constants. It describes approximately the behavior of gases and of
the liquid-vapor transition. For convenience we call a system obeying this equation
a van der Waals ﬂuid or van der Waals gas, although it also describe the liquid
phase. From the microscopic point of view, a ﬂuid that undergoes a liquid-vapor
transition must consist of molecules that attract each other over long distances and
repel at short distances. A van der Waals ﬂuid is to be understood as composed
of hard spherical attractive molecules. The repulsion is the result of the rigidity
of the molecules and is related to the parameter b. The attraction is related to the
parameter a, which must be understood as a measure the force of attraction between
molecules.

The fundamental relation of a van der Waals ﬂuid, in the Helmholtz free energy
representation, is obtained by integrating p D .@f=@v/T . Using (8.3), we get
f D RT ln.v  b/  a
v  K;
(8.4)
where K depends only on temperature. Therefore, the entropy s D .@f=@T /v is
given by
s D R ln.v  b/ C K0:
(8.5)
To determine K.T /, we assume that the isochoric molar heat capacity cv of the van
der Waals is constant and equal to c. Thus T .@s=@T /v D c, that is, K00 D c=T ,
so that

8.2.2
Maxwell Construction
At high temperatures, the van der Waals isotherms, in the p  v diagram, are
monotonically decreasing and the free energy, given by (8.4) is a convex function. At
low temperatures, however, the isotherms are no longer monotonic and free energy,
accordingly, loses convexity. Therefore, in this temperature regime, we adopt as the
free energy of the van der Waals ﬂuid the convex hull of the function given by (8.4),
which is obtained by construction of a double tangential, as shown in Fig. 4.3a.
The convex hull corresponds to perform a Maxwell construction on the van der
Waals isotherms, which consists in tracing a straight line parallel to the axis of
the volumes, so that the areas between the segment and the isotherm are equal as
shown in Fig. 4.3b. The equivalence between the double tangent construction and
the construction of Maxwell is shown as follows. Let A and B be the two points
where the segment is tangent to the curve f versus v. The coordinates of these
points are .vL; fG/ and .vG; fG/. Notice that the derivatives .@f=@v/ at the points
A and B are the same which means that the pressures corresponding to these two
points are equal. This common pressure we denote by p and, from the graph 4.3a,
we get
f .vL/  f .vG/ D p.vG  vL/:

phase diagram pressure versus temperature. The thick line is the line of phase coexistence
The right and left hand sides of this equation are identiﬁed as the two areas
mentioned above.
To determine the coexistence line, we use equation (8.11) or (8.9) and the
equation
p D p.vL/ D p.vG/:
(8.13)
Eliminating vL and vG from these equations, we ﬁnd p.T / as a function of T .
Using expressions (8.3) and (8.4), for pressure and free energy, into equations (8.9)
and (8.13), we get equations whose solutions give, for each isotherm, the values of
vL, vG and p, that are shown in Fig. 8.2.
We should give a justiﬁcation for the Maxwell construction since it involves an
integral along a path that passes necessarily through unstable states, which would
be illegitimate. The justiﬁcation would be the construction of the double tangent
which, as we have seen, leads us to the Maxwell construction but does not involve
unstable states. However, we must remember that, to obtain the free energy from
the equation of state, we have performed an integral that necessarily went through
the same unstable states, and again illegitimate. The unstable states, on the other
hand, can be avoided, as argued in the following if we assume the Grifﬁths postulate
according to which the free energy must be analytical within a single-phase region.
With this assumption the Maxwell construction is fully justiﬁed.
Suppose that we use only the monotonic part of p.T; v/ to determine f .T v/
by integration, thus avoiding unstable states. Below the critical temperature, we
must necessarily use two monotonic branches of the same isotherm. The free
energy obtained by integration along an isotherm will also have two branches,
both convex. These two branches connected by a double tangent, constitute with
the double tangent the free energy, which is entirely convex. The two branches,
however, are associated with different integration constants K1.T / and K2.T /,
which depend on T . For f .T; v/ to be analytical within the single phase region

8.2
van der Waals Theory
125
it is required that K1.T / and K2.T / are analytical in T within the same region. As a
consequence, the analytical continuation of K1.T / and K2.T /, if they exist, should
be the same. But in this case the procedure just presented becomes equivalent to
Maxwell construction.
In summary, the placement of the horizontal segment of the isotherm in a
position different from that given by the Maxwell construction would make f .T; v/
a nonalytic function inside a single-phase region.
8.2.3
Critical Point
Increasing the temperature along the coexistence line, the difference v D vG  vL
between the molar volumes decreases and vanishes at a certain temperature that we
call critical temperature Tc. At this temperature, v D 0 and the two phases become
identical. The corresponding point .Tc; pc/ in the phase diagram marks the end of
the coexistence line. Above the critical temperature the van der Waals ﬂuid exhibits
a single phase.
The critical point can be determined by
@p

and
@2p
@v2 D 0;
(8.14)
because the critical point is both a stationary point and an inﬂexion point, as seen in
Figs. 8.1 and 8.2. From the van der Waals equation, we get

The compressibility factor Z of a ﬂuid is deﬁned by Z D pv=RT . Therefore,
from this equation we conclude that at the critical point Zc D 3=8 for a ﬂuid
that satisﬁes the van der Waals equation. In Table 8.1 we present the values of
Zc obtained from the critical properties of several pure substances. Although the
experimental values for Zc D pcvc=RTc are not equal to 3=8 D 0:375, they are
close to each other, mainly those related to the noble gases.
8.2.4
Expansion Around the Inﬂexion Point
For temperatures near the critical temperature, the molar volumes of the liquid and
vapor phases, vL and vG, are close to each other and close to the inﬂexion point v0
of the van der Waals isotherm. Therefore, if we want to determine vL and vG near
the critical temperature, it is reasonable to approximate the van der Waals isotherm
and the free energy by an expansion around v D v0.
The expansion of p.v/ up to cubic terms gives

8.2.5
Compressibility
At temperatures above the critical temperature, the isotherms are strictly monotonic
decreasing so that the isothermal compressibility T D .1=v/.@v=@p/ is positive
(Fig. 8.3). The largest value of T along an isotherm occurs at the inﬂexion point.
At the critical temperature it diverges because the derivative @p=@v vanishes at this
point. According to (8.21), the pressure varies with the molar volume, along the
critical isotherm, and around the critical point, according to the equation
p D pc  3pc
2v3c
.v  vc/3:
(8.37)
Let us determine next the behavior of T around the critical point, along the
coexistence line and its extension, deﬁned by (8.29), which coincides with the
inﬂexions points of the isotherms. From (8.21), we get

If we wish to determine T along the critical isochoric we substitute v D vc into
(8.38). However, the second term inside the square brackets is of higher order
compared to the ﬁrst and can be neglected. Therefore, the result (8.40) is also valid
for the critical isochoric near the critical point.
For temperatures below Tc, along the coexistence line, we should specify whether
the compressibility is being determined for the liquid (v D vL) or for the vapor
(v D vG). In both cases, however, according to (8.31), we have

(8.44)
where the coefﬁcients AC and A, related to the behaviors of the compressibility
above and below the critical temperature, differ by a factor of 2, that is, AC=A D 2.
8.2.6
Molar Heat Capacity
Let us determine the isochoric molar heat capacity along the critical isochoric near
the critical point (Fig. 8.3). Above the critical temperature, there is just a single
phase whose internal energy is given by (8.8). Since cv D .@u=@T /v, then
cv D c
for
T > Tc:
(8.45)
Below the critical temperature, the two phases coexist and along the critical
isochoric the internal energy is given by

Deriving the expression for u with respect to T , we obtain

for

(8.48)
where c is a positive constant. Therefore, the molar heat capacity cv of the van der
Waals ﬂuid displays, along the critical isochoric, a jump at T D Tc equal to 9R=2.
8.3
Critical Behavior
8.3.1
Critical Exponents
Around the critical point, some thermodynamic properties have singular behavior.
The compressibility and the molar heat capacity, for example, grow without bounds
and diverge at the critical point. Figure 8.4 shows the divergence of molar heat
capacity of argon and carbon dioxide at the critical point. It is established that the
singularities are well represented by power laws when the quantities are placed as
functions of the deviations .T  Tc/ and .p  pc/ of temperature and pressure from
their critical values. Since the critical point marks the end of the coexistence line,
it is natural to examine ﬁrstly how the densities of the liquid and vapor approach
each other and become identical at the critical point. We assume that the difference
between them vanishes at the critical point in accordance with the power law
L  G  .Tc  T /ˇ
or
vG  vL  .Tc  T /ˇ:
(8.49)
Another important quantity in the characterization of the critical behavior in
ﬂuids is the isothermal compressibility, which diverges at the critical point. We
assume that along the critical isochoric (v D vc or  D c) and for T > Tc, it
behaves according to
T  jT  Tcj:
(8.50)
Below the critical temperature, T < Tc, we observe that the compressibility along
the coexistence line. In this case, it can be determined either for the liquid or for the
vapor. However, we assume that the compressibility of both phases have the same
behavior around the critical point and that it is given by (8.50).
It is also interesting to determine how the density and pressure approach their
critical values. We assume that along the critical isotherm (T D Tc) they have the
same behavior

We consider ﬁnally the isochoric molar heat capacity cv. We assume that this
quantity behaves along the critical isochoric according to
cv  jT  Tcj˛;
(8.52)
both above and below the critical temperature. In general we expect a weak
divergence for the isochoric molar heat capacity. It is possible that this divergence
is of the logarithmic type
cv  ln jT  Tcj:
(8.53)
The notation a.x/  b.x/ used to characterize the critical behavior, where both
a and b diverge or both vanish when x ! 0, means that the ratio a=b approaches a
ﬁnite constant or, equivalently, that ln a= ln b ! 1 when x ! 0.
If the critical behavior corresponds in fact to a power law, the critical exponent is
deﬁned by the power law. It is convenient, however, to deﬁne the critical exponent
more broadly to include other behaviors that are not strict power laws. Thus, we
deﬁne the critical exponent , associated with a quantity a.x/, by
 D lim
x!0
ln a.x/
ln x
;
(8.54)
or equivalently by a  x. With this deﬁnition we see that a logarithm divergence
is associated to an exponent zero.
The exponents ˇ, , ı and ˛ contained in the power laws (8.49)–(8.52), called
critical exponents, concisely characterize the critical behavior. Table 8.2 presents
experimental values of the exponents for the critical point related to the liquid-vapor

Fig. 8.5 Experimental data for liquid carbon dioxide in coexistence with its vapor, obtained by
Michels et al. (1937). In (a) we show the density of the liquid L (upper branch), the density of the
vapor G (lower branch) and the mean .L C G/=2 versus temperature. In (b) we show a log-log
plot of =c versus T=Tc, where  D L  G and T D T  Tc. The slope of the straight
line ﬁtted to the data gives the result ˇ D 0:35
transition of several pure substances. The results show that there is a good agreement
among the values for each exponent, indicating a universal character of the critical
behavior. The results (8.33), (8.44) and (8.37), obtained from the van der Waals
equation, give us ˇ
D 1=2, 
D 1 and ı
D 3, which are distinct from
the experimental values, which means that the van der Waals equation does not
adequately describe the behavior of the ﬂuid near the critical point. However, the
theory of van der Waals reveals that the critical exponents are independent of the
parameters a and b and in this sense are universal.
As an example of the determination of the exponent ˇ from the experimental
measurements done in carbon dioxide (CO2), we show in Fig. 8.5a the graph of L

and G versus temperature. To estimate the exponent ˇ and the critical temperature
from the data of Fig. 8.5, we plot lnŒ.L G/=c versus lnŒjTc T j=Tc. The value
used for the critical temperature is the best ﬁtting of a straight line: Tc D 31:06.
According to (8.49) the slope of this straight line is identiﬁed as the exponent ˇ.
From the ﬁtting one obtains ˇ D 0:35. From this value one obtains also the critical
pressure pc D 72:85 atm.
The critical density is obtained in an approximate way by using the Cailletet-
Mathias rule. According to this rule, around the critical point, the arithmetic mean
.L C G/=2 is linear with temperature, as seen in Fig. 8.5a The value obtained in
this manner gives c D 0:467 g/cm3. However, as we will see later this rule is not
valid very near the critical point.
Other thermodynamic quantities can be analyzed as to the behavior around the
critical point. Using the following thermodynamic identity
cp D cv C T v
 @p
@T
2
v
T
(8.55)
and taking into account that .@p=@T /v is bounded and nonzero, we conclude that the
isobaric molar heat capacity cp diverges as T because the divergence of cv is weak
when compared to the divergence of T . From these result and using the identity
s D cv
cp
T ;
(8.56)
we conclude that the adiabatic compressibility s diverges as cv. Therefore, along
the critical isochoric line, the critical behavior of cp is related to the exponent  and
that of s is related to the exponent ˛.
If we recall that the speed of sound in ﬂuids is directly related with the adiabatic
compressibility by
vsom D
1
ps
;
(8.57)
then the measurements of the velocity of sound along the critical isochoric line, near
the critical point, provides an experimental method to determine the exponent ˛.
8.3.2
Singular Part
The thermodynamic properties of a pure substance, including the singular behavior
around the critical point, are contained in the fundamental relation. In this sense
it is desirable to establish a form for the thermodynamic potential, valid around
the critical point, from which we power law introduced above could be derived.
The thermodynamic potential more convenient for this purpose is the one for which
all independent variables are thermodynamic ﬁelds. We therefore choose the molar
Gibbs free energy g.T; p/ which is a natural function of T and p.

134
8
Criticality
To proceed with the analysis of the critical behavior, it is convenient to separate
the molar Gibbs free energy g.T; p/ into a regular part gr.T; p/ and a singular part
gs.T; p/ containing the anomalies related to the critical point and the discontinuities
along the coexistence line. Thus, we write
g.T; p/ D gr.T; p/ C gs.T; p/:
(8.58)
According to this separation, any thermodynamic quantity will also have a regular
and a singular part. The singular part of the quantities that are ﬁnite at the critical
point must be chosen such that it vanishes at this point, which can always be made
by the addition of appropriate terms in gr.T; p/. In this way, we guarantee that the
singular part of any nondiverging quantity will vanish at the critical point.
The regular part of the Gibbs free energy is assumed to have an expansion around
the critical point .Tc; pc/ which, up to linear terms in .T  Tc/ and .p  pc/, is
given by
gr.T; p/ D gc C vc.p  pc/  sc.T  Tc/;
(8.59)
where gc D g.Tc; pc/, vc and sc are the molar volume and molar entropy at the
critical point.
To explore in a systematic way the consequences of a privileged direction in the
phase diagram, determined by the transition line, it is convenient to make a change
of variables. Near the critical point, the line of coexistence is represented by the
semi-straight line deﬁned by (8.1). The axes corresponding tho the new variables
have origin at the critical point and one of them coincides with the coexistence line
(8.1). We adopt the following transformation
" D .T  Tc/ C B.p  pc/
(8.60)
and
 D A.T  Tc/ C .p  pc/;
(8.61)
where B is a constant to be deﬁned later. We remember that A is a constant strictly
positive. The line of coexistence (8.1) in the new variables is given by  D 0 and
" < 0.
In this new reference system we write the singular part of the molar Gibbs free
energy as
gs.T; p/ D G ."; /;
(8.62)
so that
v D @g

where G1 D @G =@" and G2 D @G =@ and vr D @gr=@p and sr D @gr=@T are the
regular parts of the volume and entropy.

point we use the relation cv D cp  T vA2T , obtained from the identity (8.55), to
write
1
T cv D .AB C 1/f.AB  1/G11."; / C 2AG12."; /g:
(8.67)
In these three expressions above we have omitted the regular part by taking
into account that these quantities diverges at the critical point and are therefore
dominated by the singular part.
Up to now the constant B contained in the transformation of variables (8.60) and
(8.61) has not been speciﬁed. Next, we choose this constant in such a way that the
singular part of the Gibbs free energy is symmetric with respect to the transition
line, that is, so that G ."; / is an even function with respect to the variable ,
G ."; / D G ."; /:
(8.68)
In addition to this symmetry, the function G ."; / has the usual properties of the
thermodynamic potentials; it is continuous and concave. The derivative of G1."; /
is an even function of  and is continuous. The derivative G2."; / is an odd function
of  and continuous except over the line of coexistence where it has a discontinuity.
These properties are shown in Fig. 8.6.
Along the coexistence line, the vapor molar volume vG and the liquid molar
volume vL are obtained by taking the limits  ! 0 and  ! 0C, respectively, in
expression (8.63):
vG D vr C BG1."; 0/ C G2."; 0/
(8.69)
and
vL D vr C BG1."; 0/ C G2."; 0C/:

Widom Scaling Theory
The Widom scaling theory concerns the behavior of the thermodynamic quantities
around the critical point. According to this theory, the value of a certain thermody-
namic quantity in a certain point of he phase diagram can be obtained from another
point by a change is scale. The critical point is taken as the reference point for the
changes of scale. If we consider the following scale transformation
."; / ! .

(8.76)
that connect two points of the phase diagram, then the singular parts of the
Gibbs free energy corresponding to these two points are connected by a scale
transformation, that is,
G .

(8.77)
The parameters

0 and

respectively. Without losing generality we may write

(8.78)
valid for any positive values of

respect to the variables " and . The exponents a and b are connected to the critical
exponents introduced above, as we will se later.
The homogeneity property of G ."; / implies that its derivatives are also
homogeneous functions. Indeed, deriving (8.78) with respect to " and , we get

(8.79)
and
G2."; / D

Deriving these expressions with respect to " and , respectively, we get in addition

b/;
(8.81)
and
G22."; / D

(8.82)
Next we determine the behavior of these quantities along the coexistence line
and its extension. For " < 0 and  D 0, and choosing 
 D j"j1, we get
G1."; 0/ D j"ja1G1.1; 0/;
(8.83)
G2."; 0˙/ D j"jabG2.1; 0˙/;

For " > 0 and  D 0, and choosing

G11."; 0/ D "a2G11.1; 0/;
(8.87)
G22."; 0/ D "a2bG22.1; 0/:
(8.88)
Replacing these results into the expressions (8.71), (8.74) and (8.75), we reach
the results

(8.89)
T  j"ja2b;
(8.90)
cv  j"ja2:
(8.91)
We see therefore that the Widom scaling theory predicts power laws for the
critical behavior of these quantities. The result for the compressibility was obtained
considering that the second term of (8.74) dominates over the ﬁrst. Comparing
these expressions with the equations (8.49), (8.50) and (8.52), we ﬁnd the relations
between the critical exponents and the indices a and b:
˛ D a C 2;
(8.92)
ˇ D a  b;
(8.93)

(8.94)
In doing the comparison, we have taken into account that along  D 0 the variable
" is proportional to T  Tc.
For " D 0 and  > 0, and choosing 
 D 1=b, we get
G2.0; / D .ab/=bG2.0; 1/:
(8.95)
Replacing into (8.73), we reach the result
v  vc  .ab/=b;
(8.96)
where we have taken into account only the dominant term in (8.73) and we have
approximated vr by vc. Comparing with expression (8.51), and taking into account
that along " D 0,  is proportional to p  pc, we get the following relation between
the exponent ı and the indices a and b

In fact, it will be the same along any straight line that intercepts the critical point,

The four critical exponents ˛, ˇ, , and ı are not all independent. We can choose

Introduction
9.1.1
Mixtures of Pure Substances
The mixtures of pure substances are quite common in nature. Some mixtures are
homogeneous others are heterogeneous. The atmospheric air is a homogeneous
gaseous mixture of nitrogen, oxygen and other gases in smaller proportions. Oil is
a natural mixture of hydrocarbons. The rocks, like granite, are solid heterogeneous
mixtures. The homogeneous mixtures have uniform physical aspect and consists of
a single thermodynamic phase. The heterogeneous mixtures, on the other hand, are
formed by an aggregate of thermodynamic phase in coexistence. Due to gravity,
the different phases of a heterogeneous liquid mixture are arranged one above the
other, separated by menisci and sorted according to density. In a heterogeneous solid
mixture the phases are displayed in a fragmented and intricate arrangement.
The separation of the components of a mixture to obtain pure compounds is a
major problem. Once the separation is made, the pure substances may be used to
obtain new compounds. Distillation is an example of a process of liquid separation
by evaporation and condensation of vapor.
In this chapter and the next, we analyze mixtures of pure substances that do
not lose their identities when they enter the composition of a mixture. That is, the
chemical species in the mixture are the same as the pure substances used to make
the mixture. They do not undergo any change, that is to say there is no chemical
reactions within the mixture. Therefore, the number of moles of each pure substance
remains unchanged before and after the mixture composition.
The chemical species comprising a mixture are generically called constituents
of the mixture. In a molecular mixture, each constituent is represented by a type
of molecule. If there is no chemical reaction, the number of chemical species
corresponding to the number of components of the mixture. In mixtures in which
chemical reactions occur, which will be treated in the last chapter, the number

of components equals the number of chemical species minus the number of
independent chemical reactions.
9.1.2
Solutions
If a mixture displays a single phase, that is, if it is homogeneous, it is also called a
solution. In this case we say that the components are miscible. The component with
the greatest concentration is conventionally called solvent and the others, of lower
concentration, solutes. In a solution, we also say that the component of the greatest
concentration dissolves the ones with lower concentration. If a mixture has more
than one phase, that is, if it is a heterogeneous mixture, then each phase is a solution.
In this case, however, each one of the coexisting solutions is called saturated solu-
tion. It is also possible that a component of the mixture is completely immiscible,
forming a phase different from the others, which is not a proper solution.
A solution may be gaseous, liquid or solid. The gases are miscible in all
proportions always forming a homogeneous mixture and therefore a single phase.
A heterogeneous mixture can therefore have at most a single gas phase. The liquids
dissolve gases, solids and liquids, sometimes in large quantities. Since the liquids
are not fully miscible it is possible the occurrence of more than one liquid phase
in a heterogeneous mixture. The solids also can dissolve gases, liquids and other
solids, but the limits of miscibility are generally lower than that of liquids. Due to
this reason, the number of solid phases in a heterogeneous mixture can be great.

Fundamental Relation
9.2.1
Thermodynamic State
An adequate description of the thermodynamic state of a mixture must contain
quantities that determine the amount of each component. We may use for this
purpose the mass, but the number of moles of each component is preferable. Thus,
in the standard representation, the thermodynamic state of a mixture consisting of
c components is deﬁned by the extensive variables: entropy S, volume V , number of
moles N1 of the ﬁrst component, number of moles N2 of the second component, ...,
number of moles of the Nc of the c-th component. The corresponding fundamental
relation is given by the internal energy U.S; V; N1; N2; : : : ; Nc/ whose differential is
dU D TdS  pdV C 	1dN1 C 	2dN2 C : : : C 	cdNc;
(9.1)
where T is the temperature, p is the pressure, and 	1, 	2, ..., and 	c are the
chemical potentials of the components 1, 2, ..., and c, respectively. Other represen-
tations can also be employed including the Helmholtz representation, the enthalpy

are given by the Helmholtz free energy F.T; V; N1; N2; : : : ; Nc/, by the enthalpy
H.S; p; N1; N2; : : : ; Nc/ and by the Gibbs free energy G.T; p; N1; N2; : : : ; Nc/,
which are obtained one from another by means of Legendre transformations.
The Gibbs representation is particularly useful in the study of mixtures. The
differential of the Gibbs free energy is given by

where

an expression that can be used to recover the fundamental relation G.T; p; N1;

Consider a mixture of c distinct ideal gases in a vessel of volume V at temperature

N2; : : : ; Nc/ is equal to the sum of the Helmholtz free energy of each gas as if
each one of them were alone in the vessel, that is, as if each one were conﬁned in a

9.3.3
Entropy of Mixing
Let us determine what is called the entropy of mixing. Consider a vessel divided
into c compartments separated by diathermal and mobile walls. Each compartment
contains a different type of ideal gas and the i-th compartment contains Ni moles
of ideal gas of type i. As the walls that separate the compartments are diathermal
and mobile, all gases have the same temperature T and the same pressure p. Next
the inner walls are removed and the gases mix. The temperature and pressure of the
ideal gas mixture does not change, but the entropy increases. The entropy of mixing
is the difference between the entropy of the mixed gases and the entropy of the
gases isolated, within their respective compartments, at the same temperature and
pressure.
The total entropy of the isolated gases, each in its compartment, is simply

Dilute Solutions
9.4.1
Raoult and Henry Laws
Let us examine here the properties of dilute solutions. We consider a mixture of
c components such that c 1 components have very small concentrations. We adopt
the component 1 as the solvent and the other components as solutes. The sum of the
mole fractions of solutes is denoted by x, that is,
x D x2 C x3 C : : : C xc:
(9.36)

148
9
Mixtures
For a dilute solution x << 1 so that the mole fraction of the solvent x1 D 1  x is
close to unit.
Denoting by N D N=V the total number of moles of the solution per unit volume
and by Ni D Ni=V the number of moles of the i-th component per unit volume,
then the condition x << 1 implies N2 C N3 C : : : C Nc << N. That is to say, in a
dilute solution the number of moles per unit volume of the solutes must be small.
Note, however, that the number of moles per unit volume of the solvent need not
necessarily be small, unlike what happens with a mixture of ideal gases, in which
all the components must have low density. On the other hand, a mixture of ideal
gases need not be diluted.
We now examine the behavior of the molar Gibbs free energy g.T; p; x2;
x3; : : : ; xc/ for small values of x. We are considering g to be a function of the
mole fractions of the solutes and not of the solvent, because the mole fractions can
not all be independent. If we use equation (9.10), we see that the determination
of g is reduced to the determination of the chemical potentials 	i. Proceeding
according to Lewis, we start with two assumptions concerning the behavior of
chemical potentials for dilute solutions. The ﬁrst hypothesis states that the chemical
potential of the solvent reduces the chemical potential of pure solvent in the limit
x ! 0. The second hypothesis says that the activities zi D expf	i=RTg of the
solutes are proportional to their mole fractions, that is,
zi D ixi;
(9.37)
where the constant i depends on the pressure, temperature and nature of the solvent
and solute, but not of the mole fractions. We call this expression Henry law for dilute
solutions. The chemical potential of the solute behaves, therefore, according to
	i D 	ı
i C RT ln xi;
(9.38)
where 	ı
i D RT ln i.
To determine the chemical potential of the solvent, we use the Gibbs-Duhem
equation (9.11). But before, we see that for T and p constant, we have d	i D
RTdxi=xi for i D 2; 3; : : : ; c which, replaced in the Gibbs-Duhem equation, gives
.1  x/d	1 C RTdx D 0;
(9.39)
because x1 D 1  x and x D x2 C x3 C : : : C xc. Integrating this equation, we get
	1 D g1 C RT ln.1  x/;
(9.40)
where we take into account that in the limit x ! 0, the chemical potential of the
solvent reduces to the chemical potential of pure solvent, which is identiﬁed with
the molar Gibbs free energy of the pure solvent, denoted by g1. The activity z1 D
expf	1=RTg of the solvent is given therefore by
z1 D z
1.1  x/;
(9.41)

9.4
Dilute Solutions
149
that is, the activity of the solvent of diluted solutions is proportional to the mole
fraction of the solvent x1 D 1  x. Moreover, the constant of proportionality z
1 D
expfg1=RTg is identiﬁed with the activity of the pure solvent. We call this expression
Raoult law for dilute solutions.
We remark that the Raoult law concerns the solvent (whose mole fraction is close
to unity), while Henry law concerns the solutes (whose mole fractions approach
zero). If the dilute solution is in coexistence with its vapor, then the equilibrium
condition implies that the activities of the components in the solution should be
equal to the activities of the components in the vapor phase. If, in addition, the vapor
can be considered an ideal gas mixture, then, according to (9.29), the activities zi
are proportional to the partial pressures pi of the gases. Therefore, from Raoult and
Henry laws, we can write
p1 D p
1 .1  x/;
(9.42)
for the solvent, and
pi D kix;
(9.43)
for the solutes, where p
1 , the vapor pressure of the pure solvent, and ki depend only
on temperature. These relations constitute the original forms of Raoult and Henry
laws, respectively.
Replacing, ﬁnally, the expressions for the chemical potentials in (9.10), we obtain
the explicit form for the molar Gibbs free energy of a dilute solution,

(9.44)
The chemical potential of the solvent can be written as
	1 D g1  RTx;
(9.45)
since for small values of x we can approximate ln.1  x/ by x. Importantly,
the chemical potential 	1, both in the form (9.40) or as (9.45), does not depend
on the characteristics of the solutes, but only on the sum of their mole fractions.
This particularity provides the emergency of so-called colligative properties, which
are those properties that depend on the number of moles of the solutes but do not
depend on the type of solutes present in the solution. Typical examples of colligative
properties are:
(a) Osmotic pressure;
(b) Elevation of the boiling temperature of liquid solutions with non-volatile
solutes (the vapor has a single component: the solvent), and
(c) Lowering of the fusion temperature of the solids immiscible in solute (the solid
phase contains a single component: the solvent).

Osmotic Pressure
Consider a system consisting of two compartments separated by a rigid and diather-
mal wall so that, at equilibrium, the temperature will be equal, but not the pressure.
On one side there is a dilute solution and on the other there is only the pure substance
number 1, the solvent. The wall is permeable but only to the component 1. The wall
being permeable to the solvent, in equilibrium, the chemical potential of the solvent
in solution should be equal to the chemical potential of the pure solvent, that is,
	1.T; p; x2; x3; : : : ; xc/ D g1.T; p0/;
(9.46)
where p0 is the pressure of the pure solvent. The osmotic pressure ˘ is deﬁned as
the difference in pressure between the two sides of the wall, that is, ˘ D p  p0.
If the solution is diluted, then the chemical potential of the solvent is given by
(9.45) which, replaced in (9.46), yields
g1.T; p/  RTx D g1.T; p0/:
(9.47)
But for small values of ˘ D p  p0, we may approximate g1.T; p/ by
g1.T; p/ D g1.T; p0/ C v1.T; p0/.p  p0/;
(9.48)
where v1 D @g1=@p is the molar volume of the pure solvent. Since the solution is
diluted, v1 can be replaced by the molar volume v of the solution. Therefore,
RTx D ˘v;

or

(9.50)
which is the van ’t Hoff equation, where Nsolute D x=v D .N2CN3C: : :CNc/=V is
the total number of moles of solute per unit volume (molarity). For dilute solutions,
the osmotic pressure is thus independent of the nature of the solvent, depending only
on the molarity of the solute.
The experimental measurement of the osmotic pressure can be used for the
determination of molecular weight M of the molecules, especially macromolecules.
For a solution with only one type of solute Nsolute D solute=M , where solute is the
density of the solute (mass per unit volume). Therefore,

so that the experimental measurements of pressure and density provide the molecu-

then it is convenient to plot the right side of equation (9.51) as a function of density
for various values of solute and make the extrapolation solute ! 0.

Lowering the Melting Point
We will examine here the lowering of the melting temperature of a pure substance
when certain impurities are dissolved in it. Suppose that the impurities and the pure
substance are miscible in the liquid phase but not on the solid phase. Thus we should
examine the coexistence of a liquid phase, which is a dilute solution, and a solid
phase consisting only of the pure solvent. The liquid phase is a dilute solution whose
chemical potential of the solvent is given by equation (9.45), that is,
	1 D gL
1 .T; p/  RTx;
(9.52)
where gL
1 .T; p/ is the molar Gibbs free energy of the pure solvent and x is the
sum of mole fractions of the solutes in the liquid phase. Since we are assuming
that the solid phase is composed only by the solvent, then the chemical potential of
the solvent in the solid phase is independent of x and is equal to the molar Gibbs
free energy of the solid which we denote by gS
1 .T; p/. The equilibrium condition is

known as the cryoscopic constant. Notice that this expression is valid as long as the
liquid solution coexist with the pure solid.

So far we have obtained two expressions for the Gibbs free energy. One related to
the mixture of ideal gases, valid in the regime of low densities of all components,
and another related to the dilute solutions, valid in the regime of low mole fractions
of solutes. We now develop expressions of the Gibbs free energy for solutions that
are not necessarily dilute or a mixture of ideal gases.
Suppose that N1 moles of a pure substance 1, N2 moles of a pure substance

all pure substances which are isolated have the same temperature T and the same

where G.T; p; N1; N2; : : : ; Nc/ is the Gibbs free energy of the mixture and gi.T; p/
is the molar Gibbs free energy of the i-th pure substance. Similarly, we deﬁne the
variation in entropy S, the volume change V , and the enthalpy change H.
In the process of formation of the mixture, there will be certainly an increase in
the entropy and in general one expects a nonzero variation of the enthalpy and of
other thermodynamic properties. In an ideal mixture, or ideal solution, we assume
that the variation in entropy is the same as that occurring in a mixture of ideal gases,
at constant temperature and pressure, that is

and that the variation in enthalpy vanishes, that is, H D 0. As the mixture of the

(9.61)
A signiﬁcant consequence is that there is no variation of volume nor variation of
internal energy when pure substances are mixed to form an ideal solution. In fact,
deriving both sides of (9.61) with respect to pressure and taking into account that
S is independent on p, we see that V D @G=@p D 0. Since p is constant then
U D H  pV D 0.

The i-th chemical potential is given by

Remember that the mole fractions xi are not independent but are linked by (9.9).
From (9.69), we see that the activity zi D e	i=RT for the i-th component is related
with the mole fraction by means of
zi D z
i xi;
(9.70)
where z
i
D egi=RT is the activity of the pure component. Therefore, for ideal
solutions, if any component is considered to be a solvent (xi close to unit), Raoult
law is fulﬁlled. If on the other hand one component is considered to be a solute (xi
close to zero), Henry law is satisﬁed with i D z
i .
In general, we do not expect real solutions to behave as ideal solutions. However,
certain molecular solutions behaves approximately as ideal solutions. In particular
a mixture of ideal gases is an ideal solution. It sufﬁces to compare the equations for
the Gibbs free energies of an ideal gas mixture and of an ideal mixture, given by
(9.21) and (9.62), respectively.
9.5.2
Hildebrand Regular Solutions
A Hildebrand regular solution is deﬁned as one whose change in entropy is the same
as that of an ideal solution. This means that when mixing several pure substances
at the same temperature and pressure, the entropy change S is given by (9.60).
However, unlike what happens in an ideal solution, the change in enthalpy H
in a Hildebrand regular solution does not vanish. Since S is independent of
temperature, it follows that H should also be independent of temperature. Indeed,
deriving H D G C TS with respect to temperature, we get
@
@T H D @
@T G C S C T @
@T S D 0;
(9.71)
because S is independent on T and S D @G=@T .
If we demand that the mixture is formed without change of volume, then H
should be independent of pressure. In fact, deriving H D GCTS with respect
to pressure,
@
@p H D @
@p G C T @
@p S D V;
(9.72)
since S does not depend on p and V D @G=@p. Therefore, if V D 0,
then H will be independent of pressure. In this case, H D U , since H D
U C pV .

Replacing G D H  TS in expression (9.59) and using the notation

QG.p; N1; N2; : : : ; Nc/ D NQg.p; x1; x2; : : : ; xc/;

(9.75)
where Qg does not depend on T .
9.5.3
Excess Quantities
In the study of real solutions it is convenient to use as a reference system an ideal
solution with the same composition. Thus, we introduce the thermodynamic excess
quantities, deﬁned as the differences of the thermodynamic quantities from the ideal
forms. The excess Gibbs free energy GE is deﬁned by
G D GE C

(9.76)
Clearly, for an ideal solution, GE D 0. Comparing this expression with equation
(9.73), we see that the Hildebrand regular solution is the one such that GE does not
depend on temperature but only on pressure and number of moles.
Other excess quantities are deﬁned in an analogous way and can be obtained
directly form GE. Thus, the excess entropy is given by SE D @GE=@T and
the excess enthalpy by H E D GE C TSE. The excess chemical potentials 	E
i D
@GE=@Ni are related to the chemical potentials 	i by
	i D 	E

From this relation we conclude that H E D H, that is, the excess enthalpy
coincides with the variation in enthalpy in the formation of a mixture.

may write
GE.T; p; N1; N2; : : : ; Nc/ D NgE.T; p; x1; x2; : : : ; xc/:

Therefore, the molar Gibbs free energy g D G=N of any solution can be written in
the form

The chemical potentials are given by

valid at T and p constant.
In the limit of dilute mixtures, the excess quantities must have certain properties
that we will examine. Comparing the expression (9.81) with the expression of the
chemical potential of the solvent, given by (9.40), and with the chemical potentials
of the solutes, given by (9.38), we see that in the limit xi ! 1, the excess chemical
potential 	E
i vanishes and the others, 	E
j , approaches 	ı
j  gj . Using these results
in (9.82), we conclude that gE also vanish in this limit.
The knowledge of speciﬁc forms of the excess Gibbs free energy gE allows the
determination of the intrinsic properties of the mixtures, as long as we know the
properties of the pure substances. In fact, if gE and gi were known it is possible to

recover g by equation (9.80). To set up gE we should take into account that gE ! 0
when xi ! 1 for any component i. The simplest form of gE that meets this property
is

(9.84)
where wij depends only on T and p, and wij D wji and wii D 0.
We remark that gE can be a singular function of the mole fractions. For example,
in the vicinity of a critical point, we expect that the thermodynamic quantities have
singular behavior. In particular, the excess Gibbs free energy must by a nonanalytic
at the critical point. However, in most cases the systems are not found inside the
critical region and can therefore be described by functions gE that are analytic in xi,
as is the case of that given by (9.84), which we call regular forms. The mixtures that
are described by such functions are called regular mixtures. Although the regular
forms for gE do not provide a precise description at the critical region, they allows
us, on the other hand, a qualitative description of this region.

of the solutes. Show that how it can be used to determine the ratio between the
molecular mass of the solvent and of the solute.

10.1.1
Substances that Are Binary Mixtures
In this chapter we study mixtures of two components, called binary mixtures which
are quite common in nature, both the homogeneous and heterogeneous. Many
minerals, when not pure substances are homogeneous solid binary mixtures such
as olivine (magnesium silicate and iron silicate) and amalgam (solid solution of
mercury and silver). The manufactured alloys, such as bronze (copper and tin) and
brass (copper and zinc) are also solid binary mixtures. Alcohol is usually found in
association with water, forming a homogeneous binary mixture.
We focus our study on the phase equilibria of binary mixtures. We initially
examine the liquid-vapor coexistence of mixtures of liquids which are miscible in
all proportions. Such mixtures may or may not have an azeotropic point. Next, we
examine the solid-liquid transition of mixtures of substances that are completely
miscible in both the solid phase and liquid phase.
Later, we pass to the study of mixtures of partially miscible liquid. In this
case it is common the occurrence of the coexistence of two liquids of different
compositions. The variation in temperature or pressure may lead the system to a
critical point where both coexisting liquids become identical. We consider, next,
the mixtures of substances partially miscible in the solid phase but fully miscible
liquid phase. The partial solubility provides the appearance of two solid phases
in coexistence. If the pure solid substances have the same crystalline structure,
then the two solid solutions also have the same crystalline structure but different
compositions. In this case, their coexistence may disappear at a critical point at
which the two solid phases become equal.
It is still possible, the occurrence of the melting of the two solid solutions while in
coexistence. In this case we will be facing the equilibrium of three phases, two solid
phases and the liquid phase, and we will have the opportunity to examine systems

we limit ourselves to the study of equilibrium types mentioned above.

Thermodynamic State
In the representation of internal energy, the thermodynamic state of a binary mixture
is deﬁned by the extensive variables: entropy S, volume V , number of moles N1
of the ﬁrst component and number of moles N2 of the second component. The
fundamental relation is given by the corresponding internal energy U.S; V; N1; N2/,
whose differential is
dU D TdS  pdV C 	1dN1 C 	2dN2;
(10.1)
where T is the temperature, p is the pressure, and 	1 and 	2 are the chemical
potentials of components 1 and 2, respectively. Other representations can be used in
the study of the binary mixtures, but the most convenient is the Gibbs representation.
The fundamental relation is given by the Gibbs free energy G.T; p; N1; N2/, whose
differential is
dG D SdT C Vdp C 	1dN1 C 	2dN2;
(10.2)

Being G extensive we may write

the chemical potentials 	1.T; p; N1; N2/ and 	2.T; p; N1; N2/ are known. From

by x1 D N1=N and x2 D N2=N , where N D N1 C N2 is the total number of moles

Dividing both members of equations (10.5) and (10.6) by N , they reduce to

(10.7)
and
 sdT C vdp  x1d	1  x2d	2 D 0;
(10.8)
where s D S=N is the molar entropy and v D V=N molar volume. From equations
(10.7) and (10.8) we conclude that
dg D sdT C vdp C 	1dx1 C 	2dx2:
(10.9)
Notice however that the differentials dxi are not independent but are linked by
dx1 C dx2 D 0:
(10.10)
Usually we eliminate dx1 in (10.9), using (10.10), which permits us to write
dg D sdT C vdp C .	2  	1/dx2:
(10.11)
Deﬁning 	 and x by
	 D 	2  	1
and
x D x2;
(10.12)
respectively, then, according to (10.11), we have
dg D sdT C vdp C 	dx;
(10.13)
so that the molar Gibbs free energy g.T; p; x/ can be considered a function of
temperature T , pressure p and mole fraction of the second component x. The
equations of state are
	 D @g

(10.14)
Given g.T; p; x/, the fundamental relation in the Gibbs representation can be
recovered by
G.T; p; N1; N2/ D Ng.T; p; x/;
(10.15)
where x D N2=.N1 C N2/. From this equation we get the following relations,

Gibbs Free Energy
10.2.1
Dilute Mixtures
In the applications that we will consider below we will use speciﬁc forms for the
Gibbs free energy. In the preceding chapter we have seen some forms that are
applied to a mixture of ideal gases and to other systems called ideal and regular
solutions. Next we will write explicitly the various expressions for the case of a
binary mixture. We consider ﬁrst the Gibbs free energy of a diluted mixture and
after we consider the ideal mixture and regular mixture forms. These expressions
should be understood as approximations to the free energy. Although approximate
they adequately describe in many cases, the properties of the mixtures, in particular
the phase coexistence.
The molar Gibbs free energy of a dilute mixture was presented in the previous
chapter and reduces, for the present case of two components, to the following
expression
g D g1.1  x/ C 	ı
2x C RT.1  x/ ln.1  x/ C RTx ln x;
(10.19)
where g1 is the molar Gibbs free energy of the pure solvent, the component 1 of the
mixture, and 	ı
2 depends only on the temperature and pressure. The mole fraction x
is related to the component 2, the solute. The expression above is valid for x << 1.
The chemical potential 	 D @g=@x is given by
	 D g1 C 	ı
2  RT ln.1  x/ C RT ln x:
(10.20)
From 	 and g, we obtain the chemical potential of the solvent 	1 D gx	, given by
	1 D g1 C RT ln.1  x/;
(10.21)
which can also be written in the form

taking into account that x << 1. The chemical potential of the solute, 	2 D 	C	1,
is given by

2 C RT ln x:
(10.23)
The activities of the solvent z1 and solute z2 are obtained by exponentiation of both
sides of equations (10.21) and (10.23) and are therefore given by
z1 D zo
1.1  x/
and
z2 D 2x;
(10.24)
where zo
1 D expfg1=RTg is the activity of the pure solvent and 2 D expf	ı
2=RTg.
These two expressions are the Raoult and Henry laws, respectively.
10.2.2
Ideal Mixtures
The expression for the molar Gibbs free energy g of an ideal mixture of several
components, seen in the previous chapter, is reduced to the following expression for
the case of two components:
g D xg2 C .1  x/g1 C xRT ln x C .1  x/RT ln.1  x/:
(10.25)
where g1 and g2 are the molar Gibbs free energies of the pure substances 1 and 2,
respectively, and x is the mole fraction of component 2.
The molar entropy @g=@T is given by
s D xs2 C .1  x/s1  xR ln x  .1  x/R ln.1  x/;
(10.26)
where s1 D @g1=@T and s2 D @g2=@T are the molar entropies of pure substances 1
and 2, respectively. The chemical potential 	 is given by
	 D g2  g1 C RT ln

1  x :
(10.27)
while the chemical potentials 	1 and 	2 of each of the components are given by
	1 D g1 C RT ln.1  x/
(10.28)
and
	2 D g2 C RT ln x:
(10.29)
If the i-th pure substance is an ideal gas then the corresponding free energy
gi.T; p/ is known and is given by

The molar Gibbs free energy g.T; p; x/ of a mixture of two components is given by
g D gE C .1  x/g1 C xg2 C RT.1  x/ ln.1  x/ C RTx ln x;
(10.32)
where gE.T; p; x/ is the molar excess Gibbs free energy, that depends on temper-
ature, pressure and mole fraction x of component 2. From it we get the chemical
potential 	 D @g=@x, given by
	 D 	E  g1 C g2 C RT ln
x
1  x ;
(10.33)
where 	E D @gE=@x. The chemical potentials 	1 and 	2 of the components are
obtained by the relations (10.16) and (10.17) and are
	1 D 	E
1 C g1 C RT ln.1  x/
(10.34)
and
	2 D 	E
2 C g2 C RT ln x;
(10.35)
where the excess chemical potential are given by
	E

(10.36)
and
	E
2 D gE C .1  x/	E D gE C .1  x/@gE

(10.37)
In order to describe the intrinsic properties of binary solutions, we must seek
speciﬁc forms of gE. A large class of binary mixtures is well described by the excess
Gibbs free energies gE that are analytic functions of x, which we call regular forms.
The mixtures are described by such regular functions are called regular mixtures.
These forms must be constructed so that gE ! 0 when x ! 0 and when x ! 1,
since, taking into account that the function gE describes the deviations of the real
solution from the ideal behavior, it must vanish when the solution is reduced to a
pure substance. We assume, therefore, that gE is the product of x.1x/ by a function
of x which is ﬁnite at x D 0 and x D 1. Under these conditions the simplest regular
form is

From gE given by (10.38) we obtain the simple regular equations

so that the chemical potentials 	1 and 	2 of each component are
	1 D wx2 C g1 C RT ln.1  x/
(10.41)
and
	2 D w.1  x/2 C g2 C RT ln x:
(10.42)
A regular form particularly useful is
gE D x.1  x/
˚
a C b.1  2x/ C c.1  2x/2

(10.43)
which leads as to the Margules equations:

Phase Transition
10.3.1
Two Phase Coexistence
The coexistence of two phases in a binary mixture is described by a linear segment
of g.T; p; x/ as a function of x, as shown in Fig. 10.1. To show this result, let us
consider a process in which the concentrations of a mixture, which displays two
coexisting phases, change, keeping the temperature and pressure constant. Under
these conditions, one phase grows over the other which decreases, changing the
proportion of each coexisting phase. However, the mole fractions of the components
in each phase remain unchanged.
Denoting by NA and NB the number of moles of each phase, then the fraction
in number of moles of phase A is rA D NA=N and of phase B is rB D NB=N ,
where N is the total number of moles. Denoting by xA and by xB the mole fractions
of component 2 in phases A and B, respectively, then the number of mole of
component 2 in phase A is xANA and in phase B is xBNB, so that the total number
of moles of component 2 in the mixture is N2 D xANA C xBNB. But the mole
fraction of component 2 in the mixture is x D N2=N and therefore
x D xArA C xBrB;
(10.49)
which is the lever rule. Since rA C rB D 1, we obtain from this rule the relations
rA D x  xB
xA  xB
and
rB D xA  x
xA  xB
:
(10.50)
Since xA and xB remain unchanged, the same happens with the molar Gibbs
free energy g
A D g.T; p; xA/ and g
B D g.T; p; xB/ of each phase because the
temperature and pressure are constant. The molar Gibbs free energy g of the mixture
is then
g D rAg
A C rBg
B:
(10.51)
Substituting (10.50) in (10.51), we get
g D xB  x

(10.52)
and therefore g is linear in x in the range xA  x  xB as g

on x but only of T and p.
In the range xA  x  xB, the chemical potential 	 D @g=@x is constant and is

Thermodynamic Equilibrium
In a system in thermodynamic equilibrium the thermodynamic ﬁelds should be
uniform. For a mixture of two components, the condition of thermodynamic
equilibrium means that the temperature T , the pressure p, the chemical potential 	1
of component 1 and the chemical potential 	2 of component 2 must have the same
value anywhere in the system. In particular, for two phases A and B in coexistence,
the condition of equilibrium is given by
TA D TB;
pA D pB;
	1A D 	1B;
	2A D 	2B:
(10.55)
where TA, pA, 	1A and 	2A denote the ﬁelds in phase A and TB, pB, 	1B and 	2B
denote the ﬁelds in phase B.
Let us imagine that the Gibbs free energy of the thermodynamic phases A and
B are described by the functions gA.T; p; x/ an gB.T; p; x/, respectively. If these
functions are two distinct branches, then, the Gibbs free energy of the mixture
g.T; p; x/ is obtained by the construction of a double tangent between the two
branches, that is, by the construction of a linear segment that connect the two points
of tangency .xA; g
A/ and .xB; g
B/ and having slope 	 given by (10.53). Taking
into account that g
A D gA.T; p; xA/, that g
B D gA.T; p; xB/, and that
	 D 	A.T; p; xA/ D 	B.T; p; xB/;
(10.56)

where 	A D @gA=@x and 	B D @gB=@x, then, equation (10.54) reads
gA.T; p; xA/  	xA D gB.T; p; xB/  	xB:
(10.57)
Equations (10.56) and (10.57) are, therefore, the conditions of thermodynamic
equilibrium and can be use to determine xA and xB as functions of T and p.
Using equation (10.16), it is easy to see that equation (10.57) is equivalent to
equation
	1A.T; p; xA/ D 	1B.T; p; xB/:
(10.58)
Adding equations (10.56) and (10.57) and using equation (10.17), we see that the
resulting equation is equivalent to equation
	2A.T; p; xA/ D 	2B.T; p; xB/:
(10.59)
These two equations are the conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium stated above
and may equivalently be used in the place of (10.56) and (10.57) to determine xA
and xB.
10.3.3
Condensation and Boiling Lines
As an example of phase transition, we examine the liquid-vapor transition of
the water-methanol mixture whose diagram is shown in Fig. 10.2. The water and
methanol are miscible in all proportions forming a liquid solution. Introducing heat
in a mixture of completely miscible liquid, at constant pressure, the temperature
increases and the mixture passes to the gaseous state. However, unlike what happens
with a pure substance, the transition does not occur in a single temperature, but
in a range of temperatures. The transition begins at the boiling temperature and
ends at the condensation temperature. These two temperatures depend on the mole
fraction x of one component, as can be seen in Fig. 10.2a. In this graph, the line
that marks the threshold of boiling is called boiling or bubble line and the line that
marks the threshold of condensation is called condensation or dew line. Similarly
if the temperature is maintained constant, the phase transition occurs between two
pressures, as can be seen in Fig. 10.2b.
To understand the graphs in Fig. 10.2, we recall that the coexistence of two
phases, for T and p ﬁxed, occurs at a well deﬁned value of the chemical potential
	.T; p/. The two phases in coexistence have also well deﬁned mole fractions
xL.T; p/ and xG.T; p/. In a graph of T versus x at constant pressure, xL.T; p/ and
xG.T; p/ constitute the boiling and condensation lines, respectively. The horizontal
line segments that connect two points on these lines are tie lines shown in Fig. 10.2a.
Along the tie line, not just the pressure p and temperature T are constant, but the
chemical potential 	 as well.

pressure versus mole fraction, at the temperature of 100 ıC. The horizontal segments are the tie
lines and represent the coexistence between the liquid (L) and gas (G) phases (Source: LB)
If the mixture is in a state corresponding to a point on the tie line, the fraction in
number of moles rL of the liquid phase and the fraction in number of moles rG of
the vapor are given by
rL D x  xG
xL  xG
and
rG D xL  x
xL  xG
:
(10.60)
Therefore, the fraction in number of moles of one phase is proportional to the
distance between the point under consideration and the end point of the tie line
corresponding to the other phase.
Heating the solution at constant pressure until a temperature between the boiling
and condensation temperatures, the mixture will be found in a state of coexistence of
liquid and vapor whose compositions are distinct from one another and distinct from
the mixture. One phase is richer in one component than the other. In the Fig. 10.2 we
can see that the vapor is rich in methanol, component 2, as the mole fraction xG of
the component 2 in the gas phase is greater than the mole fraction xL of component
2 in the vapor. The method of enrichment of one of the components of a solution by
boiling is called distillation.
10.3.4
Limit of Dilute Mixture
When x D 0 or x D 1, the boiling and condensation lines should meet as shown
in Fig. 10.2 because in both cases the mixture is reduced to a pure substance whose
transition liquid-vapor occurs at a single temperature. The behavior of these lines in
the vicinity of these points is obtained from results valid for dilute solutions because

170
10
Binary Mixtures
around them the mixture becomes diluted. Around x D 0, the component 1 plays the
role of solvent and component 2, the solute; around x D 1, the roles are inverted. For
convenience, let us analyze the behavior of the lines around x D 0, in which case
x, the mole fraction of component 2, is very small. Furthermore, let us consider the
general case of a transition between a phase A and phase B. We assume that phase
A occurs at temperatures higher than phase B.
According to Raoult law, in the form given by equation (10.22), the chemical
potential of the solvent in dilute solutions is given by
	A
1 D gA
1  RTxA;
and
	B
1 D gB
1  RTxB;
(10.61)
where gA
1 and gB
1 are the molar Gibbs free energies of the pure solvent in phases
A and B, respectively, and depend only on temperature and pressure. According to
Henry law the activity of the solute of dilute solutions is given by
zA
2 D A
2 xA;
and
zB
2 D B
2 xB;
(10.62)
where A
2 and B
2 depend only on temperature and pressure.
The condition of thermodynamic equilibrium means that the chemical potentials
of the solvent and the solute in each phase are identical. Therefore,
gA
1  RTxA D gB

(10.63)
or
xA  xB D g1

(10.64)
where g1 D gA

(10.66)
which are the equations describing the lines that determine the thresholds of the
phase transition. Note that if the pure substances are immiscible in one phase, the
results above yield the van ’t Hoff formula. Suppose that the miscibility occurs only
at the phase A. Then, A

the transition temperature of the pure solvent.
10.4
Completely Miscible Substances
10.4.1
Phase Coexistence
Here we examine liquid-vapor and solid-liquid transitions in binary mixtures of pure
substances which are miscible in all proportions. When mixed, such substances form
a single liquid solution or a single solid solution. Examples of pairs of completely
miscible liquids are water and methanol, water and ethanol, benzene and ethanol,
acetone and chloroform. Heating a liquid solution, it turns into vapor, which is also
a solution. Many pairs of pure solids also are miscible in all proportions. Examples
of solid solutions are: olivine (magnesium silicate and iron silicate), silicon and
germanium, silver and gold, bismuth and antimony. Such solid solutions become
liquid solutions at temperatures sufﬁciently high.
Let us suppose that, when isolated, the pure substances 1 and 2 undergo a
transition from phase A to phase B, along the line of coexistence p
1 .T / and p
2 .T /,
respectively. The molar Gibbs free energy of the pure substances g1.T; p/ and
g2.T; p/ are considered to have two branches each corresponding to the two phases,
that is,
gi.T; p/ D
 gA
i .T; p/;
phase A;
gB
i .T; p/;
phase B;
(10.68)
for i D 1; 2. The coexistence line p
i .T / for each isolated pure substance is
determined by imposing the equality gA
i .T; p/ D gB
i .T; p/.
We imagine that the molar Gibbs free energy of the mixture g.T; p; x/, where
x represents the mole fraction of component 2, is constituted also by two branches
corresponding to the two phases, that is,
g.T; p; x/ D
 gA.T; p; x/;
phase A;
gB.T; p; x/;
phase B:
(10.69)
Let us assume that each phase can be approximated by a regular solution so that the
molar Gibbs free energies gA and gB of each phase are of the form (10.32). The
chemical potentials of the components 1 and 2 of the phase A are thus of the form
(10.34) and (10.35), that is,

Similarly, the chemical potentials of the components 1 and 2 of phase B are also

(10.73)
where 	EA

and 	EB

are the excess chemical potentials of the components in phases
A and B, respectively.
If there is phase coexistence, the mole fraction of component 2 in phase A will be
denoted by xA and in phase B by xB. According to equations (10.58) and (10.59), the
coexistence of phases is obtained by imposing the equality of the chemical potentials

lines that determine the thresholds of the transition between A and B.
10.4.2
Liquid-Vapor Equilibrium
To determine the lines that give the threshold of the transition in the diagram p
versus x or in the diagram T versus x, we must know how the free energies gi.T; p/
of the pure substances depend on T and p. We consider initially the liquid-vapor
transition. We assume that the gas corresponding to the pure substances are ideal
gases so that

where p

From these expressions we have gi D gG

The condensation line, p as a function of xG, is obtained in implicit form from the

To determine the condensation and boiling lines in the diagram temperature

where T 

equation can be derived with the help of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, assuming
that the boiling latent heat `i is a constant and that the volume of the vapor is much
greater than the volume of the liquid. Substituting this result in (10.80) and (10.81),
we get

example, in the system heptane-hexane, as can be seen in Fig. 10.3a, which can then
be considered as an ideal mixture.
The ideal behavior displayed by the system heptane-hexane is also presented by
other pairs of similar pure substances. However, in general, we expect deviations
from the ideal behavior, that can be relevant such as in azeotropes or small such as
in the oxygen-nitrogen system shown if 10.3b. These deviations can be described
by means of the regular forms for the excess quantities. Using equations (10.87)

respectively, and the value w=R D 12 K, we get the continuous line shown in
Fig. 10.3b.
10.4.3
Azeotropy
The results obtained so far show boiling and condensation lines that are strictly
monotonic, as seen in Figs. 10.2 and 10.3. However, these lines may have a
maximum or a minimum as seen in Fig. 10.4. At this point, called azeotropic, the
boiling and condensation lines meet so that in the azeotropic point xL D xG D xaz.
A binary mixture, with a composition corresponding to the azeotropic point, passes
from the liquid to the vapor phase, at constant pressure, at a unique temperature
and in this sense it resembles a pure substance. However, an azeotropic mixture
distinguishes from a pure substance because the composition of the azeotropic point
depends on pressure. The properties of mixtures related to the azeotropic point are
known as Gibbs-Konovalov laws.
There are many pairs of liquids that displays an azeotropic point including
benzene-ethanol and benzene-methanol, whose diagrams are shown in Fig. 10.4,
chloroform-acetone, water-ethanol, etc. At the pressure of 1 atm, the azeotropic
point of the mixture water-ethanol occurs when the mole fraction of ethanol

ethanol increases, reaching the value xaz D 0:98 at the pressure of 0.13 atm. An
important consequence of the existence of the azeotropic point is that the distillation
process stops working when one reaches this point. A mixture water-ethanol that is
poor in ethanol may become richer in ethanol by distillation until the concentration
reaches the azeotropic point.
At the azeotropic point the coexistence line p versus 	, at constant T , reaches
a maximum or a minimum and in both cases dp=d	 D 0. From the Clausius-

Solid-Liquid Equilibrium
We examine now the solid-liquid equilibrium of substances that are completely
miscible both in the solid and liquid phases or, equivalently, the coexistence of a
solid solution and a liquid solution. Complete miscibility occurs, for example, in
mixtures of substances which in the solid phase has the same crystalline structure.
The solid solutions can be of type substitutional or interstitial. In the ﬁrst type, the
atoms of one species are replaced by atoms of the other species in the vertices of
the crystalline structure, which remains unchanged. In the second type, the atoms
of the solute are inserted in the interstices between the atoms of the solvent. The
complete solubility can occur only on the substitutional type. Examples of binary
mixtures whose components have the same crystalline structure and are miscible in
all proportions include: silver and gold, gold and copper (above 410 ıC), gold and
nickel (above 810 ıC), gold an platinum (above 1,260 ıC), bismuth and antimony,
cadmium and magnesium (above 253 ıC), chromium and molybdenum (above
880 ıC), copper and nickel, copper and platinum (above 816 ıC), germanium and
silicon, selenium and tellurium, magnesium silicate and iron silicate (olivine), and
Al2O3 and Cr2O3.
Raising the temperature of these systems, they melt giving rise to a liquid
solution, which coexist with the solid solution. We denote by xS and xL the mole
fractions of component 2 in the solid and liquid phases, respectively. The mole
fractions xS and xL as functions of temperature or pressure constitute the solid line
(solidus) and the liquid line (liquidus). To determine them, we start from equations

Coexistence of Two Liquid Phases
When phenol (C6H6O) is added to water at room temperature one obtains a
homogeneous solution, that is, a single thermodynamic phase, as long as the mass
of phenol is not above 8 %. Above this value, phenol ceases to dissolve completely
in water causing the appearance of another liquid phase, richer in phenol. Since the
densities of the phases are distinct, the phase with lower density stays above that of
higher density, separated by a meniscus. Adding more phenol, the two phase remain
in coexistence until the mass of phenol in the mixture reaches 72 %. Above this
value, the system returns to have single phase. If the mass of phenol is between 8
and 72 %, the system water-phenol will be, therefore, heterogeneous and composed
by two liquid phases in coexistence. Changing the temperature, the range of phase
coexistence changes, as shown in Fig. 10.6. For any concentration of phenol in the
mixture, the two liquid phases in coexistence have each one a well deﬁned mass
fraction of phenol which, for the room temperature, is 0.08 for the phenol poor
phase and 0.72 for the phenol rich phase.
To characterize the quantity of phenol in the mixture we will use the mole fraction
x of phenol in the place of the mass fraction y, considered as the component 2 of
the mixture. The relation between these two fractions is
y
1  y D M1
M2
x
1  x
(10.105)
where M1 and M2 are the molar mass of components 1 and 2, respectively. Let
us denote by xA and xB the mole fractions of component 2 in the phenol poor and
phenol rich phases, respectively. Thus, given a mole fraction x of phenol, it is related
to the fractions of phenol in number of moles in the phenol poor phase, rA, and in
the phenol rich phase, rB D 1  rA, by the lever rule
x D rAxA C rBxB;

(10.107)
The mole fractions xA and xB of the two solutions in coexistence vary with
temperature, describing the miscibility curve, or solubility, as seen in Fig. 10.6.
Raising the temperature of the system water-phenol, from 20 ıC, xA increases and
xB decreases, so that the compositions of the two solutions become closer and, at a
certain temperature, become equal. Above this temperature, called critical solution
temperature, of consolute temperature, the two solutions become identical and the
system becomes homogeneous. In other words, the two components of the mixture
becomes completely miscible. At the critical temperature, the two mole fractions xA
and xB have the same value xc called critical mole fraction.
When the partial miscibility occurs at temperatures lower than the complete
miscibility, as happens to the system water-phenol, the critical temperature is
called upper consolute temperature. When the opposite occurs, it is called lower
consolute temperature, as is the case of the system methylamine-water which has
complete miscibility below 18.5 ıC and partial miscibility above this temperature.
Some binary mixtures, such as the system water-nicotine, have closed miscibility
curve showing upper and lower consolute temperatures. Between 61 and 208 ıC the
miscibility of the system water-nicotine is partial. Out of this range the miscibility
is total.

water-phenol can be described qualitatively by the theory of regular solutions. To

g D wx.1  x/ C .1  x/g1 C xg2

(10.108)
where g1.T; p/ and g2.T; P / depend on T and p and w.p/ depends only on
pressure. We suppose that the pure substances do not undergo any transition, so
that, unlike of what we have seen before, the functions g1 and g2 do not describe
any transition. From the expression for g, we determine the chemical potential

(10.109)
At high temperatures, g is a convex function of x. However at low temperatures,
g ceases to be convex and, in this case, we should consider the convex hull of g,
obtained from a Maxwell construction. Initially, we determine the critical point. To
this end, we calculate the derivatives of 	 with respect to x, given by

Coexistence of Two Solid Phases
The mixture of solid substances may result in both homogeneous or heterogeneous
mixtures. Crystalline solids with the same structure can be miscible in all propor-
tions, as happens with the system germanium-silicon, but may also give rise to
solid mixtures with partial solubility, as happens to the system gold-platinum below
1,260 ıC or with the system silver-copper. If the structures are distinct, the solids
will have partial solubility or will be immiscible. The alloy copper-zinc (brass) is
homogeneous if the mole fraction of zinc is lower than 0.32. Above this value and
until 0.48, the alloy consists of two solutions in coexistence. Copper and tin are
practically immiscible at room temperature, comprising an alloy, the bronze, with
two solid solutions in coexistence.
Below 1,260 ıC, the system gold-platinum may present coexistence of two solid
solutions, as seen in Fig. 10.7. One rich in platinum (phase SA), with mole fraction
xA, and the other rich in gold (phase SB), with mole fraction xB > xA. The mole
fractions xA and xB as functions of the temperature constitute the solubility curve
(solvus) that delimits the coexistence region from the two solid solutions. If a
fraction rA in number of moles of the solid solution SA is in equilibrium with a
fraction rB in number of moles of the solution SB, then the system is represented by
a point .x; T / inside the region of coexistence such that
x D rAxA C rBxB:

Equivalently
rA D x  xB

(10.129)
Raising the temperature of the system gold-platinum with ﬁxed composition and
equal to x D xc D 0:39, the two solutions in coexistence become identical at the
critical temperature Tc D 1;260 ıC, that is, xA  xB ! 0 when T ! Tc. Above
this temperature, gold and platinum become miscible in all proportions.

(1984)
10.5.5
Eutectic point
Suppose that the system gold-platinum, with ﬁxed composition, is cooled slowly
from a state corresponding to a point just above the solubility curve until a ﬁnal state
corresponding to a point below this curve. In the initial state, the system is a single
solid solution. Crossing the solubility curve, the system decomposes into two solid
solutions forming an heterogeneous system. The process of cooling, represented in
the T versus x diagram by a vertical straight line that crosses the solubility line, is
called spinodal decomposition.
If we make the inverse process, that is, we start from a state inside the
coexistence region and introduce heat, at ﬁxed composition, the system will become
homogeneous as we pass the solubility curve. Continuing the process, the solid
solution begins to melt when it reaches the solid line, becoming a liquid solution
when it reaches the liquid line. We see that the system gold-platinum turns into a
single solid solution before it melts. However, there are binary systems for which
the two solid solutions in coexistence melt without becoming a single solution. In
this case we face a coexistence of three phase: the two solid solutions and the liquid
solution.
The system silver-copper, whose diagram is presented in Fig. 10.8, shows the
coexistence of three phases at the temperature of Tt D 780 ıC, as long as the
mole fraction of copper is between xA D 0:14 and xB D 0:95. Below this
temperature the system displays coexistence between two solid solutions: one rich in
silver (phase SA) and the other rich in copper (phase SB). Above this temperature it
presents the coexistence of phase SA and the liquid phase, if x < xE, or the
coexistence of phase SB and the liquid phase, if x > xE, where xE D 0:40. The
point .xE; Tt/ is called eutectic point.

186
10
Binary Mixtures
Suppose that heat is introduced in the system silver-copper from a state in which
the two solid phases are in coexistence and such that xA < x < xE, that is, such
that the mole fraction is smaller that the mole fraction of the eutectic point. The
temperature will increase and when reaching Tt the two solid phase begin to melt.
The temperature will remain invariant until the whole phase SB disappear, remaining
only the phase SA and the liquid phase. Just before the beginning of melting, the
fractions rA and rB in number of moles of the phases SA and SB are given by
(10.129). Just after the disappearing of the phase SB, the fractions r0
A and r0
L in
number of moles of phase SA and the liquid phase are given by
r0
A D x  xE
xA  xE
and
r0
L D xA  x
xA  xE
:
(10.130)
Notice that r0
A < rA. Similarly, if the initial state is such that xE < x < xB then
phase SA will disappear remaining only phase SB and the liquid phase. If on the
other hand the system is prepared so that it has exactly the composition of the
eutectic point, then both solid phases will disappear simultaneously remaining only
the liquid phase, that is, the system will pass directly to the liquid state, as shown in
Fig. 10.8. In this sense, the heterogeneous alloy with the composition of the eutectic
point behaves as a pure substance, melting entirely at a single temperature.

Fields and Densities
We study in this chapter the phase diagrams of multicomponent systems. The
representation that provides the simplest diagrams is that composed only by ther-
modynamic ﬁelds. A system of c components is described by c C 2 thermodynamic
ﬁelds: the temperature T , the pressure p, and the chemical potentials 	1; 	2; : : : ; 	c
of the c components. However, these ﬁelds are not independent but are connected
by the Gibbs-Duhem equation
 SdT C Vdp  N1d	1  N2d	2      Ncd	c D 0;
(11.1)
where S is the entropy, V is the volume, and N1; N2; : : : ; Nc are the number of
moles of the c components. One of the ﬁelds should be chosen as dependent and
will work as a thermodynamic potential. The remaining c C 1 ﬁelds, considered
independent, comprises the thermodynamic space of dimension c C 1.
Any of the c C 2 ﬁelds can be chosen as the thermodynamic potential. If the
Gibbs-Duhem equation is written in the form
dp D NsdT C N1d	1 C N2d	2 C    C Ncd	c;
(11.2)
where Ns D S=V is entropy per unit volume and Ni D Ni=V is the number of moles
per unit volume, it becomes clear that the pressure can act as a thermodynamic
potential and the ﬁelds T; 	1; 	2; : : : ; 	c as independent variables.
As a second example, we show how 	1 can be chosen as the thermodynamic
potential. To this end we write the Gibbs-Duhem equation in the form

Let us denote, generally, the c C 1 thermodynamic ﬁelds chosen to compose
the thermodynamic space by h0; h1; h2; : : : ; hc and the respective thermodynamic
densities by 0; 1; 2; : : : ; c. These two spaces are called space-h and space-
, respectively. The ﬁelds are understood as the components of the vector Eh D
.h0; h1; : : : ; hc/, belonging to space-h, and the densities as components of the vector
E D .0; 1; : : : ; c/, belonging to space-. Denoting the thermodynamic associated

of the ﬁelds altogether. Although  is a continuous function, its derivatives, the
densities, may not be continuous. And indeed they are not continuous in the points
of space-h corresponding to a phase coexistence. A point of discontinuity in the
densities in this space indicates the occurrence of a phase coexistence.
11.1.2
Manifolds
The Gibbs phase rule concerns the number of phases that may coexist in a
thermodynamic system with c components. The phase rule is a law that can not
be derived from the laws of thermodynamics alone. It should be understood as an
independent law, compatible with the laws of thermodynamics.
In a system composed by a single pure substance (one component) we have seen
that two phases, for example, liquid and vapor coexist along a line in the phase
diagram T versus p. We have also seen that the coexistence of three phases, solid,
liquid and vapor occurs only at a single point of the two-dimensional diagram.
A binary mixture (two components) on the other hand has a three-dimensional
diagram. The usual thermodynamic space includes the temperature T the pressure p
and a third ﬁeld which we choose as the difference between the chemical potentials
of the two components. In this three-dimensional phase diagram, the coexistence of
two phases occurs on a surface, the coexistence of three phases takes place along a
line and four phases can only coexist in a point of the diagram. These results and
the generalization of them comprises the Gibbs phase rule.
To state the phase rule it is convenient to introduce what is known as the number
of degrees of freedom f for the coexistence of a certain number of phases. If the
coexistence occurs in a single point in space-h, then f D 0; if it occurs along a
line, f D 1; if it occurs on a surface, f D 2, etc. That is, f is identiﬁed as the
dimension of the manifold (a point, a line, a surface, etc.) in space-h corresponding
to the phase coexistence. The Gibbs phase rule states that the number of degrees
of freedom f for the occurrence of m thermodynamic phases in a system with c
components is given by
f D c C 2  m:
(11.12)
That is, the dimension of the manifold in space-h corresponding to the coexistence
of m phases is equal to c C 2  m.
The rule may also be expressed in terms of the manifold codimension, deﬁned
as the difference between the dimension of the space in which the manifold is
immersed and the manifold dimension. As the dimension of space-h is c C 1 then
a codimension  of the manifold of phase coexistence is  D .c C 1/  f . Thus,

Fig. 11.1 Simplices: zero-dimensional (point), one-dimensional (line segment), two-dimensional
(triangle) and three-dimensional (tetrahedron)
the Gibbs phase rule is equivalent to say that the codimension of the manifold of the
coexistence of m phases in space-h is m  1, or
 D m  1:
(11.13)
11.1.3
Simplices
Suppose that at a given point in space-h, occurs the coexistence of m phases with
densities E .1/; E .2/; : : : ; E .m/. In space-, these densities are a set of m distinct points
whose spatial distribution is a simplex of dimension m  1 (Fig. 11.1). A zero-
dimensional simplex is a point. A one-dimensional simplex is a line segment, a
two-dimensional simplex is a triangle, a three-dimensional simplex is a tetrahedron,
etc. A .m  1/-dimensional simplex comprises a set of m generic vertices located
at arbitrary positions of a space with dimension greater than or equal m  1. The
generality of the position means that two vertices of a simplex never coincide, three
vertices are never collinear, four vertices are never at the same plane, and so on.
The proposition that the coexistence of m phases in a system of several
components is represented in space- by a .m  1/-dimensional simplex constitutes
the Grifﬁths-Wheeler postulate. In the following we show that the Gibbs phase rule
can be derived from this postulate.
Denoting by .1/; .2/; : : : ; .m/ the thermodynamic potentials that describe each
of the m single phases in the neighborhood of the manifold of the phase coexistence,
then, for each single-phase region, we write the following equation

The set of equations (11.16) can be written as a scalar product
E .j /  dEh D 0;
(11.18)
valid for j D 2; 3; : : : ; m. This equation describes locally the manifold in space-h
corresponding the coexistence of m phases. Taking into account that the densities
E .1/; E .2/; : : : ; E .m/ constitute a simplex .m1/-dimensional,it is easy to see that the
vectors E. 2/; E .3/; : : : ; E .m/ comprises a set of m  1 vectors linearly independent.
On the other hand, each one of the equations given by (11.18) describes a hyperplane
in space-h perpendicular to the vector E .j /. Therefore, the m  1 equations (11.18)
describe the intersection of m  1 hyperplanes. Since no hyperplane coincides with
another because the vectors E .j / are linearly independent, then the intersection of
the hyperplanes comprises a manifold of dimension f D .c C 1/  .m  1/ D
c C 2  m, which is the Gibbs phase rule.
The Gibbs phase rule is applicable to systems of several components that are
devoid of symmetry. It can not be used indiscriminately when symmetry has
an important role. In some cases, however, we can restore the Gibbs rule if
thermodynamic space of symmetric systems is extended properly. For example,
suppose that two or more phases in coexistence are connected by symmetrical
operations. The Gibbs phase rule may be applied provided that the thermodynamic
ﬁelds, that completely break the symmetry between the phases, are added to the
space-h.

Ordinary Manifold
The phase diagram in space-h of a system of c components comprises the manifolds
(points, lines, surfaces, etc.) of phase coexistence which are connected to each
other forming a spatial structure. With the exception of zero-dimensional manifold,
which is a point, other manifolds extend continuously in space-h and can reach the

system with two components.
The surfaces of coexistence
of two phases meet at lines of
coexistence of three phases
(dashed line). These converge
to a point of coexistence of
four phases (quadruple point)
boundaries of space-h. However, it is possible, and is actually more common, for
it to ﬁnish by meeting or by transforming into other manifolds. To examine these
possibilities, we must take into account that each point in space-h that belongs to a
manifold of m coexisting phases is associated with a .m  1/-dimensional simplex
in space-.
A simplex corresponding to m coexisting phases is composed by m vertices in
space-. A property relevant to our analysis is that any set of m  1 vertices of this
simplex is also a simplex but of dimension smaller by one unit. Therefore, we can
imagine that a simplex of m vertices has as neighbors m simplices of m1 vertices.
This implies that in space-h, from a manifold of coexistence of m phases emerge
m manifolds of coexistence of m  1 phases. It is noteworthy that the latter has
dimension one unit smaller.
Based on this property, we can build possible structures of the manifolds of phase
coexistence, which we call ordinary manifolds in opposition to critical manifolds
which we will see later. In a space of dimension c C 1, we start from a zero-
dimensional manifold (a point) which corresponds to the coexistence of cC2 phases.
From this point emerge c C 2 lines of coexistence of c C 1 phases. From each of
these coexistence lines, in turn, spring c C 1 surfaces of coexistence of c phases.
From these surfaces can sprout manifolds of dimension three, and so on.
According to this scheme, we examine the phase structure of a system of one
component. In this case, the space-h is two-dimensional. The zero-dimensional
manifold (a point) corresponds to the coexistence of three phases (triple point).
Three lines of two phase coexistence converge to this point, as shown in Fig. 7.6a.
For a two component system, the space-h is three dimensional. The zero-
dimensional manifold (a point) corresponds to the coexistence of four phases. To
this point, four lines of coexistence of three phases converge, as shown in Fig. 11.2.
To each of these lines, surfaces of two phases coexistence converge.
A phase diagram comprises one or more structures of the type shown in Figs. 7.6a
and 11.2. For example, a pure substance can have multiple triple points. The most
notable of these is the point of coexistence solid-liquid-vapor. However, a pure

11.2
Structure of Phase Diagrams
193
substance can show various crystal forms that can coexist with each other or together
with the liquid forming several point of three-phase coexistence.
We should also note that cuts performed in a phase diagram in space-h of a
system of c components may represent a possible phase diagram of a system of c1
components. However, this cut should be generic, that is, it should avoid passing
through peculiar points. For example, a cut in the diagram of Fig. 11.2, represented
by h2 D const is a possible diagram of a system of one component, as long as the
cutting is not done on the quadruple point or tangentially to the line of triple points.
11.2.2
Critical Manifolds
In the study of the possible structures of a phase diagram in space-h, it is convenient
to think that an ordinary manifold of dimension f is described in parametric form
by a set of f parameters. The continuous variation of these parameters allows us to
walk on the manifold. Recall that to each point belonging to the ordinary manifold
of coexistence of m phases corresponds a simplex in the space- whose number of
vertices is equal to m. Therefore, walking along the points of an ordinary manifold,
the number of vertices of the corresponding simplices is invariant. However, the
distances between the vertices may change when walk along the manifold. Thus,
one possible mechanism for the disappearance of a manifold is that for which two
vertices of a simplex collapse into a single vertex, which means that two phases
become identical. The corresponding points in space-h deﬁne a manifold that we
call critical manifold, which has dimension equal to that corresponding to three
ordinary phases in coexistence.
One can imagine critical manifolds where more than two phases become equal.
For example, we may suppose that three phases become identical. In this case the
critical manifold has dimension equal to that corresponding to the manifold of ﬁve
ordinary phases in coexistence. In general, when i ordinary phases become identical,
the critical manifold has dimension equal to that of the manifold corresponding to
2i  1 ordinary phases in coexistence, which is the Zernike rule.
Let us imagine now a conﬁguration of phases of a system in which there are the
coexistence of m1 ordinary phases, m2 critical phases (two ordinary phases becom-
ing identical), m3 tricritical phases (three ordinary phases becoming identical), etc.
According to the Zernike rule this conﬁguration of phases correspond, as regards to
the Gibbs phase rule, to a number of ordinary phases equal to
m D m1 C 3m2 C 5m3 C    :
(11.19)
According to this rule, a system comprising a pure substance, c D 1, may display
only a critical zero-dimensional manifold in which two phases become equal. This
manifold is the critical point, the terminal point of a line of coexistence of two
phases, which was the object of our study in previous chapters. The phase diagram
in the vicinity of this point are shown in Fig. 7.5, both in space of ﬁelds and space
of densities.

11.2.3
Critical Line and Critical End Point
The thermodynamic space of ﬁelds, corresponding to a binary mixture, consists of
three variables. Usually, they include temperature, pressure, and a third thermody-
namic ﬁeld that we choose as the difference between the chemical potentials of
the two components. In this space, the coexistence of two phases takes place on a
surface, which can extend to the boundaries of the thermodynamic space or may
end in a line of critical points, which is identiﬁed as the edge of the surface of
coexistence, as shown in Fig. 11.3.
The phase diagram of a binary system may also contain lines of coexistence
of three phases, as can be seen in Figs. 11.2 and 11.4. Walking along the line of
coexistence of three phases, it is possible that it terminates at a quadruple point as
seen in Fig. 11.2. It is also possible that at some point two phases become identical
in the presence of third, as illustrated in Fig. 11.4. The corresponding point is called
critical end point because in addition to being the terminal point of a line of triple
points it is the terminal point of a line of critical points. As shown in Fig. 11.4, the
critical line, which is the edge of the surface of coexistence, ends on another surface
of the coexistence of two phases.

circles are critical end points. The full large circle is the tricritical point
11.2.4
Tricritical Point
A tricritical point is the one in which three phases become identical. It should
be distinguished from an ordinary critical in which only two become identical.
According to the Gibbs and Zernike rules three phase can only become identical
in a system that has at least three components. In a three-component system, whose
space-h is four-dimensional, three phases become identical in a zero-dimensional
manifold (a point). As the viewing of a space of more than three dimensions is
impractical, it is expedient to examine projections or cuts of this space. We can also
use the fact that a phase diagram in a given space can be seen as a possible cut of a
phase diagram in a space constituted by an additional ﬁeld. This additional ﬁeld can
then be continuously varied to change the phase diagram.
Consider the diagram of Fig. 11.5a, which can be considered a phase diagram of
a binary system and also as a cutting of the four-dimensional space .h0; h1; h2; h3/
of a ternary system. In this diagram, we are assuming that the variable h3 has a ﬁxed
value. We then vary h3 appropriately so that the critical end point moves toward the
other critical line. The tricritical point will occur when the critical end point touches
the other critical line, as can be seen in Fig. 11.5b. We see that the tricritical point is
the meeting point of three critical lines and is also the terminus of the line of triple

points. It is also possible to imagine other cuts, like those shown in Fig. 11.5c, d.
Figure 11.5c presents a line of triple points whose ends are critical end points and is
a possible phase diagram of a binary system. Appropriately varying one of the ﬁelds,
we can make the two critical end points to approach each other. The tricritical point
occurs when they coalesce, as shown in Fig. 11.5d.
11.2.5
Multicritical Points
In addition to the points mentioned above, we can imagine other points in which
several ordinary phases become identical in the presence or absence of other phases.
However, according to Gibbs and Zernike rules, the observation of such points on a
mixture of pure substances is possible only above a certain number of components.
A bicritical point (two critical phases in coexistence) can only be observed in a
mixture with at least four components. A tetracritical point (four ordinary phases
that become identical), can only be observed in a mixture of at least ﬁve components.
It is convenient to use a notation of product type to represent the conﬁguration of
the phases in coexistence. An ordinary phase is represented by the letter A; a critical
phase, in which two ordinary phases become identical, by the letter B; a tricritical
phase, in which three phases become identical, by the letter C, etc. A state composed
of two ordinary phases in coexistence is represented by A2, a triple point by A3. A
critical end point by AB, a bicritical point by B2. In general, a multicritical point is
represented by Am1Bm2Cm3Dm4 : : :. In accordance with the Gibbs and Zernike laws,
the minimum number of components necessary to observe a multicritical point is
given by

11.2.6
Other Spaces
So far, the phase diagrams were constructed in space-h, composed only by
thermodynamic ﬁelds. From the experimental point of view, it is sometimes more
convenient to use thermodynamic densities instead of thermodynamic ﬁelds as
independent variables. In a mixture of several components it is common the use of
the mole fractions, in addition to temperature and pressure, as control variables. It is
useful, therefore, to know how to construct a diagram in the space of densities from
a diagram in the space of ﬁelds. The fundamental rule is the Clausius-Clapeyron
equation (11.16) which tells us that the tie lines should be perpendicular to the lines
of coexistence, provided that the axes of space and  are parallel to the axes of
space-h.
Figure 11.6a, c, e present diagrams corresponding to three cuts of the phase
diagram of Fig. 11.4, made at constant pressure. We are identifying the ﬁelds

substances become completely miscible, passing to phase C at higher temperatures.
Figure 11.6e corresponds to a cut made at a pressure just below the pressure

in coexistence causes the appearance of phase C when the temperature reaches

A and B are solid phases and C is a liquid phase.
Figure 11.7a presents a phase diagram corresponding to a cut in the Fig. 11.5c

phases.

coexistence of three phases, which is a line in the space of ﬁelds, is represented

Grifﬁths-Landau Theory
11.3.1
Landau Function
The Grifﬁths-Landau theory allows us to determine the topology of phase diagrams
in the vicinity of critical and multicritical points. It is still able to provide
quantitative results, but its importance lies in the simplicity in obtaining the topology
of phase diagrams.

11.3
Grifﬁths-Landau Theory
199
The Grifﬁths-Landau theory takes as its starting point a thermodynamic potential
f which has a mixed dependency on ﬁelds and densities. The potential f is
a polynomial function of densities. The polynomial coefﬁcients depend only on
the ﬁelds. These two properties are sufﬁciently generic in such a way that any
thermodynamic potential that is analytic function can be approximated by a
potential of Grifﬁths-Landau type by means of a Taylor series expansion in the
densities. These include, for example, those relating to the theory of van der Waals
and regular solution theory.
Next we develop the theory for the case in which the thermodynamic potential
f is a function of only one density, which we denote by . The dominant term
of the polynomial is chosen as being convex which means that the highest power
must be even. However, this is not sufﬁcient to guarantee the convexity of f
since a polynomial function do not have in general the property of convexity. The
thermodynamic potential is therefore taken as the convex hull of f , obtained from
a Legendre transformation
 D min
 f ./g;
(11.21)
where
 D f ./  h
(11.22)
is called Landau function. Being f ./ a polynomial then  ./ is also a polynomial
of the same degree. We remark that the Landau function depend on all ﬁelds relating
to the potential  and not only on those relating to the potential f . The dependence
on the ﬁelds, however, is found only on the coefﬁcients of the polynomial of  ./.
Next we introduce a change of variables to make the analysis simpler. Deﬁning
the new density x D   N, we see that  .x/ will also be a polynomial and of the
same degree of  ./. In addition, the potential  will be given by
 D min
x f .x/g:
(11.23)
The choice of N will be done so that one of the coefﬁcients of the polynomial in x,
other than the dominant, vanishes. We point out that, although the coefﬁcients of
the new polynomial are distinct from the older ones, they are functions of the ﬁelds
only since N will depend only on the older coefﬁcients and thus only on the ﬁelds.
The description of the topology around the critical and tricritical points, as we
will see below, is obtained from the Landau polynomial
 .x/ D a0 C a1x C a2x2 C    C an2xn2 C xn;
(11.24)
where n is the degree of the polynomial, that must be even. The coefﬁcient of
the dominant term was taken as being equal to unity. This expedient is justiﬁed
by dividing both sides of equation (11.21) by the coefﬁcient of the dominant
term, which is strictly positive. The choice of the variable x was done so that the
penultimate term is absent, that is, so that the coefﬁcient of the term xn1 vanishes.

200
11
Phase Diagrams
As we said above, the coefﬁcients ai of the terms of the Landau polynomial
depend only on the thermodynamic ﬁelds. According to the Grifﬁths-Landau theory,
this dependence is smooth so that it is always possible to assume that it is linear.
Thus we consider that the coefﬁcients ai are themselves ﬁelds, obtained from
the original ﬁelds by the linear dependence. This implies that the topology of
the diagram is the same whether we use the original ﬁelds or the coefﬁcients ai,
identiﬁed as ﬁelds.
Adopting the coefﬁcients ai as ﬁelds, it is convenient to determine the density
conjugated to them, which we denote by i and are given by
` D  @
@a`
;
(11.25)
from which we obtain
` D x`;
(11.26)
where x, in this equation, represents an absolute minimum of  .x/.
11.3.2
Factorized Representation
It is convenient in our analysis to consider the polynomial Q deﬁned by Q .x/ D
 .x/  . This polynomial has the following fundamental properties. If x is an
absolute minimum of the Landau function  .x/, then x is identiﬁed as the root of
Q .x/ with even multiplicity (double, quadruple, etc.). In fact, according to (11.23),
 D  .x/ and therefore Q .x/ D 0. In addition, according to (11.23),  .x/  
and therefore Q .x/  0 for any x. As Q .x/ is analytic then in the neighborhood of
x D x this function behaves as .x  x/k, where k is even.
Based on these results, we can construct the speciﬁc Landau functions for each
one of the manifolds of the phase diagram. To this end we use the factorized
representation
Q .x/ D .x  r1/.x  r2/    .x  rn/:
(11.27)
where ri are the roots of the polynomial Q which are chosen according to the
following rules.
(a) To each ordinary phase in coexistence there corresponds a double real root.
(b) To each critical phase (two ordinary phase becoming identical) in coexistence
there corresponds a real quadruple root.
(c) To each tricritical phase (three ordinary phases becoming identical) in coexis-
tence there corresponds a real sixfold root.
(d) In general, to each multicritical phase such that p phases become identical there
corresponds a real root of multiplicity 2p.

the complex plane: small full circle, double root; big full circle, quadruple root; and empty circles,
simple roots
The remaining roots cannot be real because otherwise Q .x/ would vanish since
x takes on real values. These non real roots must appear in pairs of complex
conjugated numbers because the coefﬁcients of the polynomial are real. The real
roots constitute the absolute minima of Q .x/ and, because they are also minima of
 .x/, they are identiﬁed as the densities of the phases in coexistence.
As an example of a Landau function, Fig. 11.9 shows a polynomial of degree
eight corresponding to a critical end point (coexistence of an ordinary phase and a
critical phase). The polynomial has one double real root, one quadruple real root
and a pair of complex conjugated roots.
Finally, the absence of the term xn1 in the development of the product (11.27)
means that the sum of the roots vanishes, that is,
r1 C r2 C    C rn D 0:
(11.28)
If all roots are equal then they should vanish.
The determination of the equation that describe a certain manifold in the space
of the ﬁelds is reduced to the comparison of the development of the product (11.27)
with (11.24). This comparison allow the determination of the relations between the
coefﬁcients ai and the roots ri. Understanding the roots ri as parameters, these
relations constitute the equations that describe the manifold in a parametric way.
11.3.3
Critical Point
To describe the region of the phase diagram around the critical point it sufﬁces to
consider a polynomial of fourth order in x, Thus, the expression which we use for
the Landau function is
 D a0 C a1x C a2x2 C x4:
(11.29)
The coefﬁcients of the Landau function deﬁne the two-dimensional space .a1; a2/.

To determined the occurrence of two phases in coexistence, the polynomial Q .x/
should have two distinct double roots what allows us to write
Q D .x  r1/2.x  r2/2:
(11.30)
Since the sum of the roots vanishes, then r2 D r1, so that
Q D .x2  r2

(11.31)
Therefore,

and
a1 D 0;
(11.32)
and the conditions for the coexistence of two phases are
a1 D 0
and
a2 < 0;
(11.33)

are given by

(11.34)
When the two phases become identical, the double roots become identical.
Therefore, a critical point is characterized by the occurrence of quadruple root, that
is, Q D x4, which gives the result
a1 D 0
and
a2 D 0;
(11.35)
which are the conditions that determine the critical point. The topology around the
critical point can be seen in the diagram of a1 versus a2 as shown in Fig. 11.10. We
show also the diagram in the variables 1 and a2, where 1 is the density conjugated
to the ﬁeld a1 and given by 1 D r1 or 1 D r2.

Tricritical Point
The topology of the region around the tricritical point is obtained from a polynomial
of sixth degree, that is, from the Landau function
 D a0 C a1x C a2x2 C a3x3 C a4x4 C x6:
(11.36)
Notice that the term x5 is absent. The coefﬁcients of the Landau function deﬁne a
four-dimensional space .a1; a2; a3; a4/.
To describe the coexistence of three phases (triple point) it is necessary that Q .x/
has three distinct double roots, that is,
Q D .x  r1/2.x  r2/2.x  r3/2;
(11.37)
where r1, r2 and r3 are distinct and are the densities of each phase. Since the sum of
the roots vanishes then r3 D r1  r2, what allows us to write
Q D .x  r1/2.x  r2/2.x C r1 C r2/2:
(11.38)
Developing the product, we get
Q D .x3  px C q/2 D x6  2px4 C 2qx3 C p2x2  2pqx C q2
(11.39)
where
p D r2
1 C r2
2 C r1r2
and
q D .r1 C r2/r1r2;
(11.40)
Comparing expression (11.39) with (11.36), we get the relations
a4 D 2p;
a3 D 2q;
a2 D p2;
and
a1 D 2pq;
(11.41)
with a4 < 0 because p > 0 for any values of the densities r1 and r2. Eliminating p
and q, we obtain the following relations among the parameters ai

a1 D 1

and
a4 < 0;
(11.42)
which deﬁne surfaces of coexistence of three phases in a four-dimensional space.
Let us set up now Landau functions corresponding to critical end points. These
points correspond to the occurrence of two coexistence phases, one of them an
ordinary phase and the other a critical phase. Therefore, the critical end points are
characterized by one double root and one quadruple root, that is,
Q D .x  r1/4.x  r2/2;
(11.43)

where r1 is the density of the critical phase and r2 of the ordinary phase. Since the
sum of the roots vanishes, then r2 D 2r1 yielding the result
Q D .x  r1/4.x C 2r1/2:
(11.44)
Developing the product and comparing it with the expression (11.36), we get the
relations
a4 D 6r2

a3 D 4r3

a2 D 9r4

and
a4 < 0:
(11.46)
These relations determine lines of critical end points in a four-dimensional space.
The Landau function corresponding to an ordinary critical point is characterized
by the occurrence of quadruple root. Since the critical phase is not in coexistence
with other phases then the other roots must be non real. Therefore
Q D .x  r1/4.x  r2/.x  r3/;
(11.47)
where r1 is the density of the critical phase and r2 and r3 are complex conjugate. As
the sum of the roots vanishes then r2 C r3 D 4r1 what permits us to write Q in the
form
Q D .x  r1/4.x2  4r1x C r2/;
(11.48)
where r2 D r2r3 is real and positive. Developing the product and comparing it with
expression (11.36), we get the following relations
a4 D 10r2
1 C r2;
a3 D 20r3

a2 D 15r4

(11.49)
These relation determine in a parametric form a critical surface in a four-
dimensional space. They in fact deﬁne three critical surfaces. One of them is
obtained when r1 D 0, which results in
a1 D a2 D a3 D 0
and
a4 > 0:
(11.50)
The other two correspond to r1 ¤ 0 and are given implicitly by (11.49).

Finally, a tricritical point is described by a Landau function Q D x6 from which
we get
a1 D a2 D a3 D a4 D 0;
(11.51)
which determined the tricritical point in a four-dimensional space.
11.3.5
Diagrams
To visualize the topology of the phase diagram around the critical and tricritical
points, we use as the space of thermodynamic ﬁelds the space of the coefﬁcients
ai. For the critical point, the space is two-dimensional and is composed by the
variables a1 and a2. Figure 11.10 shows the critical line and the critical points traced
according to the conditions (11.33) and (11.35), respectively.
For the tricritical point the space is four-dimensional and is composed by the
variables a1, a2, a3 and a4. Due to the impossibility of visualizing such a space we
examine cuts made at constant a3 and at constant a4. The various manifolds deﬁned
by the conditions obtained above can be seen in Fig. 11.5 considering that a1, a2,
a3 and a4 are, respectively, parallel to h1, h2, h3 and h0. In these three-dimensional
diagrams, the triple points and the critical points are lines. The critical end points
and the tricritical point are isolated points.
Figure 11.5a, b correspond to cuttings made at constant a3. In the ﬁrst a3 is
nonzero and in the second a3 D 0. Only in this second diagram we can observe the
tricritical point since this point occurs when a1 D a2 D a3 D a4 D 0. For a3 D 0,
the critical lines are determined explicitly from (11.49). For this it sufﬁces to set
r2 D 5r2

a4 D 5r2

a2 D 15r4

(11.53)
The other critical line is described by (11.50).
If in the diagram corresponding to a3 D 0 we consider a cutting deﬁned by
a1 D 0, we obtain the two-dimensional diagram in the variables a2 and a4, as
shown in Fig. 11.11. In this diagram the critical line is given by (11.50) and the line
of triple points by a2 D a2
4=4 and a4 < 0, obtained from (11.42). In this ﬁgure we
show also the diagram in the variables 2 versus a4, where 2, the density conjugated
to the ﬁeld a2, is given by 2 D a4=2 and a4 < 0 or 2 D 0 and a4 < 0.
We can also examine a cut made at constant a4 which are shown in Fig. 11.5c,
d, and correspond respectively to a4 < 0 and a4 D 0. In the diagram of Fig. 11.5c,
the line of triple points ﬁnish in two critical end points. The location of these points

are given by equation (11.46). From them, we see that the distance between these
two points vanishes when a4 ! 0. Equivalently, the line of triple points shrinks and
disappears in this limit, as seen in Fig. 11.5d.
A diagram analogous to that of Fig. 11.5c can be seen if Fig. 11.8. The line of
triple points correspond to a stack of triangles. At the bottom and at the top of the
stack one ﬁnds line segments (degenerated triangles) that represent the coexistence
of a critical phase and an ordinary phase (critical end point). When a4 ! 0, the
stack of triangles shrinks to a single point which is the tricritical point. However,
the stack does not shrink uniformly in the three directions. The height of the stack
`3, which is the distance between the critical end points, decreases as
`3 D ja4jˇ3;
ˇ3 D 3=2;
(11.54)
a result that is obtained from (11.46). The length of the base of the triangles `2 is
equal to the length of the tie lines shown in Fig. 11.11b, which behave linearly with
a4, that is,
`2 D ja4jˇ2;
ˇ2 D 1:
(11.55)
The height of the triangles `1 is associated to the variable 1, conjugated to a1.
Therefore,
`1 D ja4jˇ1;
ˇ1 D 1=2:
(11.56)
The exponents ˇ1, ˇ2 and ˇ3 characterize the behavior of the densities around
the tricritical point. According to the Grifﬁths-Landau theory the values of these
exponents are 1/2, 1 and 3/2, respectively. The experimental results obtained in
ternary and quaternary mixtures are in agreement with these results.

Binary Alloys
12.1.1
Ordered Alloys
A crystalline solid has as a fundamental property the ordered structure of its atoms.
This structure consists of an array of sites forming a regular three-dimensional
periodic lattice. The ordered structure, strictly speaking, does not mean that the
atoms are located exactly on the sites of the lattice as they are in constant motion
due to thermal agitation. In fact, the average positions of the atoms are the points in
space that should be considered as the sites of the ordered lattice. Only for simplicity
we say that atoms themselves form the crystal lattice.
The possible crystalline structures are classiﬁed according to the symmetry
groups. The crystalline solids are ordered according to one or other structure that
deﬁned the thermodynamicstate. Many metals are ordered according to the structure
called face-centered cubic (fcc). In this structure the atoms of a simple solid are
located at the vertices and centers of cubes that make up the structure. Among
the metals that are arranged according to the fcc structure are copper, gold, silver,
platinum, nickel, lead and aluminum. Binary alloys of any of these metals form
substitutional disordered alloys with the same structure.
Gold and silver form continuous solid solution for these two metals are miscible
in all proportions. A solution of gold and silver has the fcc spatial structure where
the gold and silver atoms are distributed randomly among the lattice sites, forming
an alloy called disordered alloy. The gold and platinum also form alloys whose
atoms are distributed at random on the sites of a fcc lattice. However, gold and
platinum are not completely miscible. For certain compositions, the gold-platinum
system separates into two phases which are also disordered alloys. These two
phases in coexistence differ in the composition one being gold-rich and the other
platinum-rich as shown in the diagram of Fig. 10.7. Raising the temperature the two
disordered alloys become identical at a critical point. Above the critical temperature,
gold and platinum are miscible in all proportions.

The alloy consisting of gold and copper, on the other hand, offers the opportunity
to illustrate an alloy where the atoms are not randomly distributed on the sites of
a fcc lattice but are preferably located at certain sites of the crystal lattice. For
a better understanding, we must consider that a fcc lattice can be understood as
composed of four interpenetrating cubic sublattices. For a mole fraction of copper
around 0.25, the copper atoms are located preferentially in a sublattice and the gold
atoms preferentially in the other three sublattices, thereby forming the ordered alloy
Au3Cu. Heating this alloy it passes from the ordered state to the disordered state.
The binary alloy consisting of magnesium and cadmium also presents order
of their atoms. Figure 12.1 presents the phase diagram temperature versus mole
fraction of magnesium where one can observe the regions corresponding to the
ordered alloys Cd3Mg, CdMg and CdMg3 as well as the disordered alloy (Cd,Mg).
The transitions between all these phases are ﬁrst order including that which occurs
at x D 0:5 and at a temperature of 253 ıC. This transition is congruent, that is, it
occurs with no change in composition.
A binary system particularly interesting is the one consisting of copper and
zinc, and generically named brass. This system has several phases according to the
composition. For a mole fraction of zinc from 0.45 to 0.482 and temperature around
450 ıC, the brass is in a phase called ˇ0-brass. At this phase the alloy is in a cubic
ordered structure in which the zinc atoms are preferably at the vertices of the cubes
and the copper atoms preferably in the centers of the cubes. Heating the alloy, it
passes to a disordered phase called ˇ-brass, where the atoms of zinc and copper
are distributed indiscriminately at the corners and center of the cubes of the lattice,
comprising a lattice called body centered cubic (bcc). The transition occurs at a
temperature of 454 ıC for a mole fraction of zinc of 0.448 and at a temperature of
468 ıC for a mole fraction of zinc of 0.482. This transition is a continuous transition.

12.1.2
Order Parameter
Consider an ordered alloy of type brass-ˇ0 formed by two kinds of atoms A and B,
which are arranged in a cubic lattice in which the atoms are located either at the
vertices or at the centers of the cubes. The vertices and the centers in turn form two
sublattices that are intertwined. Suppose that the fraction x of atoms of type A is
exactly 0.5. The order does not necessarily mean that all the atoms A are found in
one sublattice and all atoms B are found in the other sublattice. This only occurs
when the order is complete, which should occur at low temperatures. The ordering
means that the atoms of one type are found preferably in a sublattice and the atoms
of the other type preferably in the other sublattice. It is convenient therefore to deﬁne
the fractions x1 and x2 of atoms A in the sublattice formed by the vertices and
centers of the cubes, respectively. The ordered alloy does not only mean that x1 D 1
and x2 D 0 or that x1 D 0 and x2 D 1 but that x1 ¤ x2. The alloy becomes
disordered when x1 D x2.
Suppose now that the fraction x of atoms of type A is different from 0.5. The
disordered alloy implies that the fraction of atoms of type A is the same in any of
the sublattices and hence x1 D x2 D x. If the alloy is ordered, then x1 ¤ x2. The
difference
 D x1  x2
(12.1)
is therefore a measure of the degree of ordering of the alloy. The quantity , called
the order parameter, vanishes in the disordered phase and is nonzero in the ordered
phase. Notice that .x1 C x2/=2 D x and therefore
x1 D x C 
2
and
x2 D x  

(12.2)
Figures 12.1b and 12.2b show the order parameter of two binary alloys as a
function of temperature. In the cadmium-magnesium alloy the order parameter
decreases and shows a jump at the transition temperature to the disordered phase,
characterizing a discontinuous transition. The ordered and disordered alloys coexist
at the transition. In the copper-zinc alloy on the other hand, the order parameter
decreases continuously and vanishes at the critical temperature, characterizing a
continuous transition.
12.1.3
Gibbs Free Energy
The thermodynamic space related to the molar Gibbs free energy g of a two
component system consists of the temperature T , the pressure p and the mole
fraction x of the second component. The variables conjugated to these quantities
are respectively the molar entropy s, the molar volume v and chemical potential 	
which is the difference between the chemical potentials of the components.

However, to treat appropriately the ordered alloys, it is desirable to extend the
thermodynamic space. To this end, let us examine the simplest case of a binary alloy
A-B whose atoms are arranged in two sublattices that we call 1 and 2. A possible
ordered structure is that in which the atoms of type A is preferably located in the
sublattice 1. On the other hand, an equally possible structure is that in which the
A atoms are located preferably in the sublattice 2. Therefore, the system is capable
of displaying two different thermodynamic states, that has to be understood as two
ordered phases in coexistence. We remark that the two ordered phases in coexistence
have the same composition. Therefore, unlike what happens with disordered phases
in coexistence, the ordered phases in coexistence can not be distinguished by the
composition.
To properly describe the coexistence of two ordered phases it is necessary to
use another variable since the composition, described by the mole fraction x of one
of the component, does not distinguish the two ordered phases. The quantity that
can distinguish these phases is the order parameter deﬁned above. Thus we add the
order parameter  to the thermodynamic space, which earns an extra dimension. The
molar Gibbs free energy then depends also on  so that
dg D Tds C vdp C 	dx C 	d;
(12.3)
where 	 is the variable conjugate to the order parameter. The chemical potential
	 is a thermodynamic ﬁeld that breaks the symmetry between the sublattices.
An equivalent description is obtained by using the variables x1 and x2, which are
the fractions of atoms of type A in sublattice 1 and 2, respectively, in place of x
and . In this representation we have
dg D Tds C vdp C 	1dx1 C 	2dx2;
(12.4)

12.2
Bragg-Williams Theory
211
where 	1 and 	2 are conjugated to x1 and x2, respectively. Using (12.2) in (12.4)
we obtain the following relations between the chemical potentials
	 D 	1 C 	2
and
	 D 1
2.	1  	2/:
(12.5)
We notice that the properties of the ordered alloy are invariant by the permu-
tation of the labels of the sublattice. As a consequence, the Gibbs free energy
g.T; p; x1; x2/ must be invariant by the permutation of x1 and x2. Therefore, the
phase diagram is invariant by the permutation of 	1 by 	2, so that the coexistence
of the two ordered phases occurs when 	1 D 	2, that is, when 	 D 0.
12.2
Bragg-Williams Theory
12.2.1
Gibbs Free Energy
The orderly arrangement of atoms in an alloy is a direct result of the forces of
attraction and repulsion between atoms. The Bragg-Williams theory considers that
the ordering of an alloy is established due to the greater attractive force between
atoms of different kind than that between atoms of the same type. To understand
the consequences of this idea, let us examine the simple binary alloy in which the
atoms are located on a bcc lattice, composed of two interpenetrating sublattices,
one formed by the vertices of the cube and the other by the centers of the cubes.
Each site belonging to a sublattice has as neighbors only sites belonging to the other
sublattice. Assuming that the dominant interaction is the one that occurs between
atoms located at neighboring sites, then the relevant interaction occurs between
atoms located in different sublattice. But, in accordance with Bragg-Williams, the
energy of interaction between atoms of different kind must be less than that between
atoms of the same type. Therefore, the local conﬁguration of lowest energy is the
one in which one atom of one type are surrounded only by atoms of distinct type,
which are on another sublattice. This favors the segregation of atoms of one type of
atoms in a sublattice and another type in another sublattice, constituting an ordered
alloy.
According to the Bragg-Williams theory the molar energy of a binary alloy has
the following form
u D uAAx1x2 C uAB.x1y2 C y1x2/ C uBBy1y2;
(12.6)
where x1 and x2 are the mole fraction of component A of the alloy in sublattice 1
and 2, respectively; and y1 D 1  x1 and y2 D 1  x2 are the mole fraction of
component B of the alloy in sublattice 1 and 2, respectively. The parameters uAA,
uBB and uAB are related, respectively, to the interaction between two atoms of type
A, two atoms of type B and two atoms of distinct types. Suppose for a moment that

212

Order-Disorder Transition
x1 C x2 D 1. If the atoms of the same type are all in the same sublattice (complete
ordering) then x1 D 1 and x2 D 0 or x1 D 0 and x2 D 1. In both cases u D uAB.
If half the atoms of one type is in one sublattice and the other half is in the other
sublattice (disorder) then x1 D x2 D 1=2 and therefore u D .uAA C 2uAB C uBB/=4.
Therefore, the ordering will be favored if uAB < .uAA C uBB/=2, that is, when the
quantity, deﬁned by
w D uAA C uBB  2uAB;
(12.7)
is positive, that is, w > 0.
The variation of energy that occurs when an alloy is made up from pure
substances is given by u D u  .u1 C u2/ where u1 and u2 are the molar energies
of the pure substances given by
u1 D 1
2uAA.x1 C x2/
and
u2 D 1
2uBB.y1 C y2/:
(12.8)
Therefore, using the results (12.6) and (12.8), we get
u D 1
2w.x1y2 C y1x2/;
(12.9)
where w is given by (12.7).
The second hypothesis of the Bragg-Williams theory concerns the entropy. We
assume that the change in entropy that occurs when we mix two metals A and B
to compose each one of the sublattices of the alloy is the same as that of an ideal
solution. Therefore, the change in molar entropy molar s of an alloy which orders
according to the two sublattices is given by
s D R
2 fx1 ln x1 C y1 ln y1 C x2 ln x2 C y2 ln y2g:
(12.10)
The variation in the molar Gibbs free energy is g D h  Ts. On the other
hand, the variation in enthalpy is h D u C pv. Under ordinary pressures, the

which is the equation that describes the critical line in the diagram temperature

in the copper-zinc alloy in the transition between the ordered phase ˇ0-brass and the

Next we determine the behavior of the order parameter near the critical line. For

the phase diagram shown in Fig. 12.4. The transitions between the phases are all
discontinuous except that occurring along the x D 0:5 which is a continuous
transition. The phase diagram predicted by the Bragg-Williams theory is distinct
from those observed experimentally for binary alloys that are ordered into four
sublattices, as that shown in Fig. 12.1. Results closer to the experimental data,
however, can be obtained from more elaborate theories.
12.3
Landau Theory
12.3.1
Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
Landau theory deals with the transition between phases which have different sym-
metries. More speciﬁcally between a phase of higher symmetry, usually occurring at
high temperatures, called disordered phase to a lower symmetry one called ordered

218
12
Order-Disorder Transition
phase. The transition to the ordered phase corresponds to a symmetry breaking as
some symmetries existing in the disordered phase will be absent in the ordered
phase. Since the symmetry breaking is not induced by any external ﬁeld, the
transition is associated with a spontaneous breaking of symmetry.
The ordered phase is actually made up of several distinct ordered phases in
coexistence which have similar structures. The structures are not arbitrary but
are connected to each other by certain symmetry operations which comprises a
group of symmetry, which we denote by G . The symmetry operations of the group
G transform an ordered state into another, thus generating all ordered states in
coexistence from one of them. The disordered phase, on the other hand, is invariant
under the transformations of the group G . According to Landau theory all ordered
states have the same Gibbs free energy which results in the following rule: the Gibbs
free energy is invariant under the symmetry operations of the group G .
To describe the ordered phase we introduce an order parameter: a thermodynamic
variable that takes nonzero values in the ordered phase and vanishes in the
disordered phase. To address the possibility of the occurrence of distinct ordered
states, we assume that the order parameter has several components which deﬁne a
vector space whose vectors we denote by E. Thus, each of the coexisting ordered
states is represented by a point in that space. The positions of representative points
of the ordered states form a geometric ﬁgure that is invariant by the symmetry
operations of the group G . The disordered phase is represented by E D 0. The
space vector is constructed so that its dimension is the same as that of the geometric
ﬁgure representing the ordered states. The thermodynamic state associated with the
molar Gibbs free energy is thus deﬁned by the components i of the vector E in
addition to the usual variables such as temperature, pressure and mole fractions.
The thermodynamic ﬁeld hi conjugated to the component i of the order
parameter is given by hi D @g=@i, where g.E/ is the molar Gibbs free energy. This
ﬁeld, when nonzero, breaks the symmetry of the disordered phase and destroys the
coexistence of ordered phases by favoring one of them. In general this ﬁeld, which
breaks the symmetry, is not accessible experimentally. The order-disorder transition
described by the Landau theory, wherein the symmetry breaking is spontaneous,
corresponds to the case where this ﬁeld is identically zero. Thus, the molar Gibbs
free energy is such that
@g
@i
D 0:
(12.44)
Since g must be a convex function of i then condition (12.44) means that the
ordered and disordered phases correspond to the minima of g with respect to the
order parameter.
The Landau theory for the order-disorder transition assumes that g.E/ is a
polynomial in i. In many applications it is enough to assume that the polynomial
is of degree 4, that is,
g.E/ D a0 C a2I2.E/ C a3I3.E/ C a4I4.E/;
(12.45)

12.3
Landau Theory
219
where In.E/ is a monomial or a sum of monomials of degree n in i and the
coefﬁcients an are dependent of other thermodynamic variables with the exception
of i. Since g.E/ is invariant under the symmetry operations of group G , the same
occurs with In.E/ which for this reason is called invariant of degree n.
The linear term is absent because the invariant of the ﬁrst degree is nonexistent.
The invariant of second order, on the other hand, always exists and is given by
I2 D
X

(12.46)
ensuring that E D 0 is a minimum of g for a2 > 0. Assuming that a2 varies with
temperature, other minima of g arise leading to the ordered states. We assume that
a2 varies linearly with temperature and vanishes at a temperature T0. That is, we
assume that a2 D A.T T0/ with A > 0 so that the disordered phase occurs at high
temperatures.
12.3.2
Continuous Transition
Let us ﬁrst examine a binary alloy A-B whose atoms can be ordered in a crystalline
structure composed by two sublattices. The ordered alloy is such that the mole
fractions x1 and x2 of component A of the alloy related to sublattices 1 and 2,
respectively, are distinct. An ordered state is such that the atoms of type A are
preferably found in sublattice 1 and is characterized by x1 > x2. The other ordered
state is the one in which the atoms of type A are preferably found in the sublattice 2.
This state is characterized by x2 > x1. One state can be generated from the other
by a spatial translation which in this case is equivalent to the exchange of atoms
between the sublattices 1 and 2. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy is invariant by the
exchange of x1 by x2.
Using the order parameter  deﬁned by
 D x1  x2
(12.47)
we see that  > 0 characterizes an ordered state and  < 0 characterizes the other
ordered state. The permutation of x1 by x2 is equivalent therefore to the permutation
of  by  and therefore g./ must be invariant under this permutation, that is,
g./ D g./:
(12.48)
According to Landau theory we postulate that g is a polynomial of fourth degree
in . Using the property (12.48) we conclude that the invariants of odd degree are
absent, which allows us to write
g D a0 C a22 C a44:

Furthermore, still according to Landau theory, the coefﬁcient a2 is positive in the
disordered phase and negative in the ordered phase, implying
a2 D A.T  Tc/;
(12.50)
where A > 0. The coefﬁcient a4 is considered to be positive.
The consequences of the result (12.50) are illustrated in Fig. 12.5. For tempera-
tures above Tc, the function g./ is convex and has a single minimum at  D 0. For
temperatures below Tc, the function g./ is no longer convex and has two symmetric
minima. In this case we consider the convex hull of g./. The appearance of two
minima is a manifestation of spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is important to
notice that as the temperature approaches the critical temperature, the minimum
continuously approaches zero.
The coexistence of two ordered phases occurs when the ﬁeld h D @g=@ vanishes
which is equivalent to saying that the order parameter  corresponds to the minimum
of g. In fact, the convex hull has a horizontal line segment (corresponding to h D 0)
that connects the two minima. From

12.3.3
Discontinuous Transition
Next we study an example where the phase transition is discontinuous, that is, the or-
der parameter undergoes a jump in the passage from the order to the disorder phase.
We will see that this is a consequence of the existence of an invariant of third order.
Let us examine a binary alloy A-B that orders in a structure composed by three
sublattices. We denote by x1, x2 and x3 the mole fractions of component A in each
of the three sublattices. An ordered phase is that in which the atoms of type A are
found preferably in sublattice 1 and indiscriminately in the other two sublattices.
Let us suppose that in this ordered state x1 D a and x2 D x3 D b with a > b.
The other two ordered states are characterized by x2 D a and x3 D x1 D b and by
x3 D a and x1 D x2 D b. The three ordered states are represented by three distinct
points in the space .x1; x2; x3/ which form an equilateral triangle.
Next we deﬁne a new coordinate system such that one axis is perpendicular and
the other two are parallel to the triangle representative of the ordered states. The one
corresponding to the perpendicular axis is deﬁned by
x D 1
3.x1 C x2 C x3/;
(12.54)
which is the mole fraction of component A. The other two are deﬁned by

and
 D

(12.55)
and work as components of the vector order parameter .; /, since they vanish when
x1 D x2 D x3. One of the ordered phase is deﬁned by  D 0 and  > 0. The other
are obtained by symmetry operations that leave the equilateral triangle invariant.
Using this symmetry operation, we can determine the invariants up to fourth order,
that are given by
I2 D 2 C 2;
I3 D 3  32;
I4 D .2 C 2/2:
(12.56)
For temperatures high enough, g.; / is a convex function with a minimum at  D
 D 0. For sufﬁcient low temperatures, g.; / develops three minima that form an
equilateral triangle. In this case the function g.; / ceases to have the convexity
properties and we should consider the convex hull. The three minima correspond
to the three phases in coexistence. One of the minima occurs along  D 0. Along
 D 0 the molar Gibbs free energy is given by
g D a0 C a22 C a33 C a44:
(12.57)
Figure 12.6 shows the graph of g./ for several values of temperature. We recall that
a2 D A.T T0/, where A > 0 and that a4 > 0. For simplicity, the other coefﬁcients
are considered constants.

is discontinuous
For low temperatures, the absolute minimum corresponds to a nonzero value of ,
characterizing an ordered phase. Raising the temperature, this minimum ceases to
be absolute. The local minimum at  D 0, corresponding to the disordered phase,
becomes then the absolute minimum. The transition, which is discontinuous, occurs
at temperature T1 which is determined by the condition g./ D g.0/, as seen in
Fig. 12.6b. Therefore, at this temperature g./ has the form
g./ D a0 C a42.  b/2;

Four Sublattices
Let us study now a binary alloy A-B that orders in four sublattices. We denote by
x1, x2, x3 and x4 the mole fraction of component A in each of the four sublattices.
The ordered state in which the atoms A are found preferable in sublattice 1 is
characterized by x1 D a and x2 D x3 D x4 D b with a > b. The other three
states are characterized by x2 D a and x3 D x4 D x1 D b, by x3 D a and
x4 D x1 D x2 D b, and by x4 D a and x1 D x2 D x3 D b. The representative
points of the ordered state make up a tetrahedron in space .x1; x2; x3; x4/. Next we
use a new coordinate system deﬁned by
x D 1

which is the mole fraction of component A, and by

given by

The molar Gibbs free energy is given by

For temperatures sufﬁciently small g.; ; / has four minima corresponding to

molar Gibbs free energy is given by
g D a0 C 3a22 C a33 C .9a41 C 3a42/4:
(12.69)
The presence of the third order invariant implies a discontinuous phase transition.

Magnetic Systems
13.1
Magnetic Materials
13.1.1
Introduction
The most evident magnetic materials are iron (Fe), cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni). At
room temperature they exhibit a natural magnetism or spontaneous magnetization
and therefore are used as permanent magnets. If heated, however, such materials lose
their natural magnetization at a given temperature, called critical temperature Tc or
Curie temperature, and become paramagnetic. The iron loses its natural magnetism
at 770 ıC, cobalt at 1;122 ıC and nickel at 358 ıC. Many compounds of the iron
group metals, for example, MnSb, CrTe and CrO2 are also ferromagnetic at room
temperature.
Certain materials, such as gadolinium (Gd) and the compounds CrBr3, EuO
and EuS, are paramagnetic already at room temperature. To acquire spontaneous
magnetization, it is necessary to lower the temperature. Gadolinium becomes ferro-
magnetic below 20 ıC. The compounds CrBr3, EuO and EuS become ferromagnetic
at low temperatures.
Magnetite .Fe3O4/, mineral known since ancient times by its magnetic prop-
erties, as well as other iron oxides with the natural spinel crystal structure, such
as MgFe2O4; MnFe2O4, NiFe2O4, CoFe2O4 and CuFe2O4, also exhibit a natural
magnetization. Although presenting a spontaneous magnetization, these oxides,
called ferrites, are not exactly ferromagnetic but ferrimagnetic. In any event, at sufﬁ-
ciently high temperatures they lose their natural magnetism becoming paramagnetic.
Magnetite loses magnetization at 585 ıC. Another class of ferrimagnetic materials is
that formed by the iron oxides from the crystal structure of the garnet. An important
example of this category is the garnet of iron and yttrium, Y3Fe5O12, whose Curie
temperature is 287 ıC.
Other magnetic materials such as manganese (Mn) cease to be paramagnetic but
do not become ferromagnetic. They acquire magnetic states known generically as
antiferromagnetic states, which are characterized by the absence of spontaneous

and RbMnF3 are paramagnetic at room temperature, becoming antiferromagnetic at
low temperatures. On the other hand, chromium (Cr) and hematite .Fe2O3/ and the
oxides CoO and Cr2O3 are antiferromagnetic at room temperature becoming param-
agnetic at higher temperature. Chromium becomes paramagnetic above 39 ıC. The
temperature below which the material becomes antiferromagnetic is called N´eel
temperature, TN . Although the antiferromagnetic state do not present spontaneous
magnetization it should not be confused with the paramagnetic state.
13.1.2
Microscopic State
From the microscopic viewpoint each of the compounds mentioned above should
be understood as a large collection of microscopic magnetic dipoles which, in the
case of ionic compounds, are located at the magnetic ions. The magnetic ions are
the ions of transition metals, especially those of the iron group of iron, or the rare
earth ions. The interactions between the magnetic dipoles are the cause of several
types of magnetic ordering. These interactions are not properly magnetic, as one
might imagine at ﬁrst, but originate from the Pauli exclusion principle of quantum
mechanics.
In the ferromagnetic state, the interactions between the dipoles favor the parallel
alignment of them. In the simplest antiferromagnetic state the interactions cause
an antiparallel alignment of dipoles. At high temperatures or if the interactions
between the dipoles are negligible, the thermal agitation causes the dipole moments
of ions to point in arbitrary directions in space giving rise to a magnetically
disordered state, with a zero total dipole moment. This state magnetically disordered
is called paramagnetic state. Thus, when increasing the temperature of the magnetic
substances mentioned above, they undergo a transition from a magnetically ordered
thermodynamic phase, which may be ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic or other
more complex, to a magnetically disorderly thermodynamic phase, the paramag-
netic phase.
13.1.3
Paramagnetism
The paramagnetic state is characterized from the macroscopic point of view by the
linear response to an applied magnetic ﬁeld. In absence of the ﬁeld, a sample of
paramagnetic material does not exhibit magnetization. Applying a ﬁeld the sample
acquires a magnetization that increases linearly with the ﬁeld. If, on the other
hand, the ﬁeld is reduced and vanishes, then the magnetization is also reduced and
vanishes. For small values of the applied ﬁeld H, the magnetization m of a sample
in the paramagnetic state is proportional to the ﬁeld, that is,

where 0, the magnetic susceptibility, is positive. Increasing the ﬁeld, the behavior
of m with H is no longer linear and at sufﬁciently high values of the ﬁeld, the

where C is a positive constant. Equation (13.1) together with equation (13.2)

microscopic point of view, an ideal paramagnetic material corresponds to a system
consisting of non interacting permanent magnetic microscopic dipoles. Examples
of such materials include the paramagnetic salts of the elements of the iron group
and rare earths such as those presented in Table 13.1. In these compounds the
magnetic ions are far from each another so that the interaction between them can
be considered negligible.
For materials that have a paramagnetic phase, but are not ideal paramagnets, the
quantity 0 behaves, at sufﬁciently high temperatures according to the Curie-Weiss
law

experimental data of 1=0 versus T , as shown in Fig. 13.1. The asymptote intersects
the axis of temperatures at T D  and the slope provides 1=C. The constant 
should not be confused with the transition temperature.
13.1.4
Ferromagnetism
Suppose that a ferromagnetic substance is subjected to a magnetic ﬁeld. If the sub-
stance is heated while the ﬁeld is maintained constant, then the magnetization of the
substance varies continuously with increasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 13.1b.
For any temperature below or above the critical temperature, the substance exhibits
a magnetization due to the presence of the ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 13.2. Then assume
that the ﬁeld is turned off slowly at a given temperature, kept unchanged. If the
temperature exceeds the Curie temperature, T > Tc, the magnetization vanishes
linearly with the ﬁeld, m D 0H, characterizing the paramagnetic state. If the
temperature is lower, T
< Tc, the magnetization does not disappear and the
substance remains showing a magnetization even after the ﬁeld has been turned
off, which for that reason is called the remanent magnetization. For small values of
the ﬁeld the magnetization depends on the ﬁeld according to
m D m C 0H

Fig. 13.2 Magnetization m versus ﬁeld H for several temperatures below and above the critical
temperature obtained experimetally for nickel by Weiss and Forrer (1926). The temperatures are
given in ıC and the critical temperature occurs at 357:6 ıC. Above the critical temperature, m ! 0
when H ! 0. Below, m approaches the spontaneous magnetization when H ! 0
where the spontaneous magnetization m and the susceptibility 0 depends only on
temperature. The different behaviors, above and below the critical temperature can
be seen in Fig. 13.2, which shows isotherms obtained experimentally for nickel both
above and below the Curie temperature, occurring at 357 ıC.
At zero ﬁeld, the remanent or spontaneous magnetization, varies with tem-
perature and vanishes continuously at the critical temperature. Above the critical
temperature it is identically zero. The behavior of the spontaneous magnetization
of nickel with the temperature can be seen in Fig. 13.1b. At low temperatures,
the magnetization m reaches its saturation value. Table 13.2 shows the values of
saturation of magnetization and the magnetization at room temperature for several
ferromagnetic materials.
The understanding of the ferromagnetism presents, sometimes, a situation which
seems paradoxical. As mentioned above, a sample of ferromagnetic material such
as iron must have a spontaneous magnetization below the critical temperature.

However, any sample of iron does not display in general the expected permanent
magnetization, which is achieved only after being magnetized, that is, after having
been subjected to a magnetic ﬁeld. This can be explained assuming that the sample
is composed of several macroscopic magnetic domains, each possessing a magnetic
dipole in a certain direction. The dipoles of different domains point to arbitrary
directions which results in a vanishing total dipole. To restore the natural magnetism
of the sample it is necessary to subject it to a magnetic ﬁeld, that is, to magnetize it.

Magnetic Thermodynamic Potentials
13.2.1
Magnetic Work
To study the effects of a magnetic ﬁeld on a sample of magnetic material we use a
solenoid inside which we place the sample. The solenoid is traversed by an electric
current supplied by a battery, thus producing a magnetic ﬁeld in its interior. The
magnetic induction ﬁeld B inside the solenoid is associated with the magnetic ﬁeld
H and the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume or volumetric magnetization,
M of the sample by the relation
B D 	0.H C M /;
(13.5)
where 	0 is the permeability of vacuum. In the absence of the sample, the magnetic
induction ﬁeld within the solenoid is given by
Be D 	0He:
(13.6)

13.2
Magnetic Thermodynamic Potentials
231
The local ﬁeld H and the external ﬁeld He are produced by the same free currents
that run through the solenoid. However, they may not be identical. For a uniform
external ﬁeld, we can show that the inﬁnitesimal magnetic work dWmag performed
on the magnetic sample is given by
dWmag D Be  dM;
(13.7)
where M is the total magnetic dipole moment of the sample.
To show the result (13.7) we proceed as follows. For simplicity, we consider a
cylindrical solenoid of length ` and cross-sectional area equal to A and that the
sample ﬁlls the entire space within the solenoid. We also assume that H and M are
uniform and parallel to the axis of the solenoid and that edge effects are neglected.
The local ﬁeld H inside the solenoid, which in this case coincides with the external
ﬁeld, is given by
H D NI
` ;
(13.8)
where N is the number of spiral of the solenoid and I is the electric current through
the solenoid. The magnetic induction ﬁeld B inside the solenoid varies in time
so that the potential difference V at the ends of the solenoid is equal to the time
variation of the ﬂux of magnetic induction ﬁeld. Since the total ﬂow is NAB, then
V D NAdB

(13.9)
The power P transfered to the system solenoid-sample is P D V I. Using (13.8)
and (13.9) we reach the result
P D H`AdB
dt D VH dB
dt ;
(13.10)
where V D `A is the volume of the solenoid and is also the volume of the sample.
Let us now determine the power transferred P0 to the solenoid when it is empty.
Using the same arguments, we obtain

Therefore, the magnetic work rate dWmag=dt D P  P0 performed only on the

dWmag D BedM:
(13.14)
In the International System of Units, the magnetic dipole moment M is measured
in amp`ere square meter (Am2) and the magnetic induction ﬁelds B and Be are
measured in tesla (T). The magnetic ﬁelds H and He as well as the volumetric
magnetization M are measured in amp`ere per meter (A/m). The magnetic dipole
moment per mole, or molar magnetization, m is given in Am2/mol.
A standard dipole moment widely used is the Bohr magneton deﬁned as e„=2me,
where e is the charge of the electron, „ is the Planck constant and me is the mass
of the electron. The Bohr magneton is almost identical to the dipole moment of the
free electron and is 9:2740154  1024 Am2. Here it is useful to deﬁne the molar
Bohr magneton by 	B D .e„=2me/NA, where NA is the Avogadro constant. In the

Thermodynamic Potentials
The inﬁnitesimal change of internal energy dU of a magnetic system is equal to
the sum of heat introduced dQ D TdS and the work done on the magnetic system
dWmag D HdM, that is,
dU D TdS C HdM:
(13.16)
To simplify notation we denote by H the external magnetic induction ﬁeld Be,
which we call external ﬁeld or the applied ﬁeld. Importantly, the total dipole
moment M must be understood as an extensive thermodynamic quantity and H
as a thermodynamic ﬁeld. Thus we understand that internal energy U of a simple
magnetic system is a function of the extensive variables S and M . More precisely
we consider that the internal energy is also a function of the number of moles N
so that U.S; M; N / is the fundamental relationship of a simple magnetic system in
the representation of internal energy. The entropy S.U; M; N / is also a fundamental
relationship for which we have

The thermodynamic potentials have the usual properties of convexity. In particular

The left hand side of this equation vanishes identically because, inverting u.T /,
we see that T is a function of u but not of m. As the right hand side must also
be identically zero, we conclude that H=T is independent of u, depending only
on m. We reached then the following result due to Langevin: the magnetization m
of a paramagnetic ideal system depends on temperature T and ﬁeld H through the
combination H=T .
The result of Langevin leads directly to the Curie law. It sufﬁces to recall that for
a paramagnetic system, the magnetization m is proportional to the ﬁeld H for small
values of the ﬁeld, that is, m D 0H, where 0 depends on T . The dependence
0 with temperature must be such that m is a function of H=T . Therefore, it is
necessary that 0 D C=T so that
m D C H

(13.38)
Equation (13.38) deﬁnes the equation of state m.H; T / of an ideal paramagnetic

The Langevin equation of state, however, is based on a classical description of
microscopic magnetic dipoles. A more appropriate description, which takes into
account the quantum aspects, is that given by the equation of state used by Brillouin.
13.3.2
Brillouin Theory
From the microscopic point of view an ideal paramagnetic solid comprises a set of
non-interacting magnetic dipoles located at the magnetic atoms. As the origin of the

236

microscopic magnetic dipole moment is the angular momentum of the electrons and
that it is quantized, we must presume that the same occurs with the dipole moment
of magnetic atoms. Assuming that the component of the moment of each dipole in
the direction of the applied ﬁeld H takes discrete values and equally spaced, then in
accordance with Brillouin, the magnetization m is given by

The number of values that the component of the magnetic dipole can take is 2J C 1
and J can take one of the following values: 1=2; 1; 3=2; 2; 5=2; : : :. For small values

(13.43)
Therefore, the saturation magnetization and Curie constant can be equivalently
be given by the dimensionless quantities b and p. If the magnetization of a
paramagnetic substance follows the Brillouin equation of state then these two
quantities are related by p D b

Table 13.1 shows the experimental data of C obtained by the Curie law
for various paramagnetic substances and the respective values of dimensionless
quantity p. Figure 13.3 shows the magnetization of three paramagnetic salts as
functions of H=T . They are consistent with (13.40) corresponding to J D 3=2
for chromium salt, J D 5=2 for iron salt and J D 7=2 for the gadolinium salt.

Spontaneous Magnetization
To explain the emergence of spontaneous magnetization in ferromagnetic materials,
Weiss imagined that each microscopic dipole magnetic material is subjected to the
action of the ﬁeld produced by neighboring dipoles. Weiss assumed that this ﬁeld
should be proportional to the magnetization m so that the total ﬁeld on a dipole
would equal H C 
m, where the parameter 
 > 0. Thus, even in the absence of
applied ﬁeld H, the dipole could be subjected to a local ﬁeld, called by Weiss the
molecular ﬁeld, which would orient the dipole.

If in the equation of state of an ideal paramagnetic system we replace H by

paramagnetic transition. Using equation (13.44), we get

For zero applied ﬁeld, H D 0, this equation becomes

RT m/:
(13.54)
To see that this equation has a nonzero solution, corresponding to a spontaneous
magnetization, let us resort to a graphic method. Using an auxiliary variable x D

	m=RT, equation (13.54) can be written in the form
RT

	2 x D tanh x:
(13.55)
The function tanh x has the aspect shown in Fig. 13.4a. On the graph we draw
the straight line .RT=
	2/x. One solution is x D 0 and exists for any value of
temperature. It is the sole solution if the slope of the straight line is greater or equal
to the slope of tanh x at x D 0, that is, as long as RT=

equivalent to T  Tc, where Tc is given by

Magnetic Systems
For T < Tc, there are two nontrivial solutions corresponding to the interception
of the straight line with the curve, as seen in Fig. 13.4a. The positive solutions are
presented in Fig. 13.4b for each value of temperature.
The value of the constant 
 can be determine from (13.56) as long as the
saturation magnetization 	 is known. It is more interesting however to determine
the value of the Weiss molecular ﬁeld HW D 
	 D RTc=	. To estimate HW
we assume that 	 is of the order of magnitude of the Bohr magneton 	B. Therefore
HW  RTc=	B and using the value of the critical temperature of iron, we get
the estimate HW  103 T.
Let us compare now HW with the ﬁeld Hd created by a magnetic dipole of the
order of the Bohr magneton at a point situated at a distance a corresponding to the
spacing between magnetic atoms in a solid. Such a ﬁeld is Hd D 107	2
B=N 2
Aa3.
Using the value for a equal to 2  1010 m, we obtain the estimate Hd  101 T.
Thus we see that Hd is much smaller than HW, which means that in a ferromagnetic
material the interaction between the magnetic dipoles cannot be of magnetic origin,
as we should expect. We conclude that ferromagnetism is due to a nonmagnetic
interaction between atoms. In fact, this interaction has quantum origin and is based
on the Pauli exclusion principle.

Fig. 13.6 Molar magnetic Helmholtz free energy f versus magnetization for a ferromagnetic

to the critical temperature (b), and below the critical temperature (c)
where we have chosen the integration constant in such a way that f .T; m/ reduces
to the expression (13.51) when 
 D 0.
Figure 13.6 shows f as a function of magnetization m for several temperatures.
For temperatures below the critical temperature, given by (13.56), f .m/ ceases to
have the convexity properties and in these cases we need to consider the convex hull.
The convex hull is obtained by the construction of the double tangent which in the
present case corresponds to a horizontal line segment. The double tangent connects
the two minima of f that occur at m D ˙m, where m is the positive root of
H.m/ D 0. Thus we distinguish three regimes:
(a) When T > Tc, corresponding to the Figs. 13.5a and 13.6a, equations (13.57)
and (13.59) are valid for any values of m. Since m vanishes linearly with H
when H ! 0 then we are facing a paramagnetic state.
(b) When T D Tc, corresponding to the Figs. 13.5b and 13.6b, equations (13.57)
and (13.59) are also valid for any values of m. In addition m vanishes with H
when H ! 0, but not linearly. We call this state critical.
(c) When T < Tc, corresponding to the Figs. 13.5c and 13.6c, equations (13.57)
and (13.59) are valid only for jmj  m. For jmj < m, f is constant and

H D 0. In this case, when H ! 0 from positive values m ! m > 0.
Therefore, we are facing a ferromagnetic state and m is identiﬁed with the
spontaneous magnetization.
The diagram H versus temperature T displays a coexistence line which occurs
along H D 0 and for T < Tc. On the line two thermodynamic phases coexist: one
corresponding to the magnetization m D m and the other corresponding to the
magnetization m D m.

Below the critical temperature and at zero ﬁeld, the two phases are in coexistence
and we should consider a susceptibility of each one of them. However, both
phase have the same susceptibility. The susceptibility as a function of temperature
is obtained by the replacement of the nonzero solution m of equation (13.58)

the molar enthalpy h D u  Hm, which is

(13.65)
At zero ﬁeld and for T > Tc, the magnetization vanishes, so that h D 0 and cH D 0.

Next we determine the molar heat capacity at constant magnetization, cm D

result (13.61) gives u D 0, from which we conclude that cm D 0. For T < Tc,
we should consider the molar heat capacity of each one of the coexisting phases.
However, they have the same molar energy given by u D 
.m/2=2, which
becomes equal to the molar enthalpy h. Therefore, cm D cH along H D 0.

Anisotropy
The results obtained so far are valid for isotropic magnetic systems and, therefore,
such that the spontaneous magnetization can appear in any direction. A magnetic
system, however, can be anisotropic so that the spontaneous magnetization may
appear only in certain crystalline directions. In systems with uniaxial anisotropy, for
example, it appears along the anisotropic axis. If the magnetic ﬁeld is applied along
this preferential direction, the free energy (13.59) and other results obtained above
remain valid. But, if the ﬁeld is applies in another direction, the free energy is no
longer appropriated. In these cases, we adopt the following molar Helmholtz free
energy

 D 1 corresponds to the isotropic case and  D 0 to the extreme anisotropy.
We consider  < 1, so that the spontaneous magnetization will occur along the
preferential direction z.
In the present case the following relation is valid

If the external ﬁeld is applies along the preferential direction z, that is, if Hx D

The results obtained previously become valid for this case and, in particular, the
susceptibility obtained previously becomes what we call parallel susceptibility.
Next we examine the case where the ﬁeld is applied in a direction perpendicular
to the preferential axis z, that is, such that Hy D Hz D 0 and Hx ¤ 0. We wish
to determine the perpendicular susceptibility ? D @mx=@Hx at zero ﬁeld. To this
end we examine equation (13.75) for small values of Hx. In this case, mx will also
be small and will vanish when Hx ! 0 even in the ferromagnetic phase since
the spontaneous magnetization emerges only in direction z. For small values of m

Critical Exponents
In the neighborhood of the critical point, the thermodynamic quantities have
a singular behavior. The molar susceptibility  has a divergent behavior and
the spontaneous magnetization m vanishes when T ! Tc, at zero ﬁeld. The
results of the previous section, obtained from the Weiss theory, describe the
ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition and in particular predict the occurrence
of these singularities. The results predicted by the Weiss theory however show
deviations from the experimental results as seen in Fig. 13.3a where 1 deviates
from the linear behavior predicted by equation (13.64). The experimental data show
that only at high temperature this linear behavior occurs, what constitutes the Curie-
Weiss law.
To describe appropriately the behavior near the critical point we assume that the
spontaneous magnetization vanishes according to

(13.85)
where ˇ,  and ı are certain critical exponents. The results (13.70), (13.64), (13.71)
and (13.68), obtained from the Weiss theory, predicts the following values for the
critical exponents: ˇ D 1=2,  D 1 and ı D 3. The experimental data on the other
hand give distinct values for these exponents, as can be seen in Table 13.3 for several
magnetic materials.
Experimentally, one also observes that the molar heat capacity cH at zero ﬁeld
has singular behavior. This quantity may diverge according to
cH  jT  Tcj˛;
(13.86)
where ˛ is positive. It is possible that cH does not diverge although has a singular
behavior. In this case, to characterize appropriately the singularity we assume the
following behavior
cc  cH  jT  Tcj˛;
(13.87)
with ˛ negative, where cc is the ﬁnite value of cH at the critical point. Figure 13.8
shows the molar heat capacity of nickel whose exponent ˛ is negative. To determine
the exponent, it is convenient to use the quantity dcH=dT to eliminate the
constant cc. According to (13.87) this quantity behaves as jT  Tcj1˛.
A singularity characterized by an exponent ˛ D 0 must be described by a more
speciﬁc form. It can be a divergence of the logarithm type
cH  ln jT  Tcj;
(13.88)
but can also corresponds to a jump in cH, as predicted by the Weiss theory and
shown in Fig. 13.7b.

Singular Part
To analyze the critical behavior, it is convenient to separate the molar Gibbs free
energy g.T; H/ in a regular part gr.T; H/ and a singular part gs.T; H/ that contains
the singularities associated to the critical point as well as the discontinuities along
the line of coexistence. Thus, we write
g.T; H/ D gr.T; H/ C gs.T; H/:
(13.92)
Any quantity obtained from g will also have a regular and a singular part. The
singular part of the nondivergingquantities is chosen so that it vanishes at the critical
point, what always can be done by the addition of appropriate terms in gr.

a and b, we ﬁnd several relations that include the Rushbrooke relation (13.89), the
Grifﬁths relation (13.90) and the Widom relation (13.91).

Universal Function
The homogeneity of the singular part of the free energy and its derivatives implies,
as we have seen, certain relations between the critical exponents. It also give rise
to certain geometric relations between the thermodynamic quantities, which we
examine now. Let us consider initially the magnetization m D G2."; H/. If, in
the regime " > 0, we choose

relation valid in the regime " < 0.
The result above tell us that the isotherms m versus H must coincide if we
perform a change of scale such that the axis-m is multiplied by j"jˇ and the axis-
H by j"j. The experimental data of magnetization m as a function of the ﬁeld H
and of the temperature T can then be analyzed in the following way. In a diagram
x-y we place y D mj"jˇ versus x D Hj"j. The data will collapse in a curve

collapse obtained from the experimental data presented in Fig. 13.2 for the isotherms

Chapter 14
Magnetic Ordering
14.1
Antiferromagnetism
14.1.1
Antiferromagnetic Materials
The antiferromagnetic crystals undergo a transition to the paramagnetic state at a
temperature called the N´eel temperature. Above it, in the paramagnetic state, the
dipoles point in random directions due to the predominance of thermal agitation,
producing a zero total magnetization. Below the N´eel temperature in antiferro-
magnetic state, the total magnetization is also zero, but for another reason. In the
antiferromagnetic state, the lattice formed by magnetic atoms is divided into two
or more equivalent sublattices, each presenting a spontaneous magnetization in a
certain direction. The interaction between the dipoles causes a magnetic ordering
such that the vector sum of the spontaneousmagnetization of the sublattice vanishes,
which deﬁnes the antiferromagnetic state.
The simplest antiferromagnetic structure consists of a magnetic lattice that
is divided into only two equivalent and interpenetrating sublattices. In this case
the interaction between neighboring magnetic dipoles, which belong to different
sublattices, favors an antiparallel alignment of them, resulting in the ordering of
the magnetizations of the sublattices in opposite directions. The simple antiferro-
magnetism is represented by the ﬂuorides FeF2 and MnF2, whose magnetic ions
form a body-centered tetragonal lattice, and the compounds KMnF3, KNiF3 and
RbMnF3, which have the structure of perovskite and whose magnetic ions form
a simple cubic lattice. Other compounds have more complex antiferromagnetic
structure, consisting of various magnetic sublattices as is the case of the compounds
MnO, FeO, CoO, NiO, whose magnetic lattices are face-centered cubic. In these
compounds, the magnetization of the sublattices are all collinear.
A magnetic structure in which the magnetization of sublattices are not collinear
is represented by the compound NiF2. The magnetic ions of this compound form
a body-centered tetragonal lattice that is divided into two equivalent sublattices.
The magnetization of the sublattices are not exactly opposite, but form an angle

giving rise to a nonzero total magnetization. As the deviation from the ideal
antiferromagnet state is small this compound exhibits a weak ferromagnetism.
The oxide Cr2O3, the hematite ˛-Fe2O3 and the compounds MnCO3 and CoCO3
have a structure in which the magnetic dipoles alternate along a particular crystal
direction. The last three are also examples of antiferromagnetic substances that have
weak ferromagnetism. The metamagnets CrSb, MnTe, CrCl2, FeCl2 and CoCl2 are
constituted by a succession of ferromagnetic layers of alternating signs.
More complex magnetic structures include the periodic in which the magnetiza-
tion varies, in magnitude or direction, along a crystal axis. The compounds MnO2,
FeCl3 and MnAu are examples of substances that exhibit antiferromagnetic periodic
helical structures.
Among the metals, chromium (Cr) is found in the antiferromagnetic state at
room temperature, becoming paramagnetic at 39 ıC. Manganese (Mn), which is
paramagnetic at room temperature, becomes antiferromagnetic below 95 K. A
summary of antiferromagnetic ordering can be seen in Table 14.1.
14.1.2
Order Parameter and Free Energy
For a suitable description of the antiferromagnetic state, as well as other types of
ordering, it is necessary to use an expanded thermodynamic space relatively to
that of a ferromagnetic. The most natural way is to use a space composed by the
magnetization of each magnetic sublattice and the temperature. To this end, let us
examine the simplest case of a system that is ordered according to two equivalent
and interpenetrating magnetic sublattices. Suppose further that the magnetizations
of the sublattices occur along a certain crystal direction. Denoting by m1 and m2
the magnetizations corresponding to the sublattices 1 and 2, respectively, then the

14.1
Antiferromagnetism
257
molar Helmholtz free energy f .T; m1; m2/ is a function of m1 and m2 in addition
to temperature. Denoting by H1 and H2 the ﬁelds conjugated to m1 and m2, then
df D sdT C H1dm1 C H2dm2:
(14.1)
The antiferromagnetic state means that the magnetization of the sublattices are
different. They need not necessarily have the same magnitude. This happens only in
restricted antiferromagnetic state, which occurs in the absence of external ﬁeld, for
which m1 D m2 and the total magnetization
m D 1
2.m1 C m2/
(14.2)
vanishes. In the presence of an external ﬁeld it is possible the occurrence of a generic
antiferromagnetic state for which m ¤ 0.
Suppose that in an antiferromagnetic phase the values of the magnetization of
the sublattices are m1 D a and m2 D b with a ¤ b. Another antiferromagnetic
phase equally possible is that for which m1 D b and m2 D a, as the sublattices
are equivalent. Therefore, an antiferromagnetic system displays two different
thermodynamic states that should be understood as two thermodynamic phases in
coexistence. We note that these two thermodynamic phases have the same total
magnetization m D .a C b/=2 and therefore can not be distinguished by m. They
are distinguished by the order parameter  deﬁned by
 D 1
2.m1  m2/;
(14.3)
that takes a positive value in one phase and a negative value in the other. The order
parameter  makes also the distinction of the antiferromagnetic phase, ordered,
from the paramagnetic phase, disordered. In the paramagnetic phase the sublattices
cannot have different magnetizations, so that m1 D m2, that is,  D 0.
An alternative and more interesting description is the one in which the thermo-
dynamic space is formed by the total magnetization m and the order parameter  in
addition to the temperature. From equations (14.2) and (14.3) we get
m1 D m C 
and
m2 D m  ;
(14.4)
which replaced in (14.1) gives

the quantity H is the variable conjugated to m and thus is identiﬁed with the external
ﬁeld. The quantity H is the ﬁeld conjugated to , which we call staggered ﬁeld.
Experimentally, this ﬁeld is identically zero.

14.1.3
N´eel Theory
The N´eel theory corresponds to the application of molecular ﬁeld theory of Weiss to
antiferromagnetic systems. According to the N´eel theory the magnetization of each
of the sublattices of a simple antiferromagnetic system is given by
m1 D 	 tanh. 	
RT .H  
m2//
(14.10)
and
m2 D 	 tanh. 	
RT .H  
m1//;
(14.11)
where 
m2 and 
m1 are the molecular ﬁelds of Weiss acting on the dipole
moments corresponding to the sublattices 1 and 2, respectively, because the
magnetic dipoles in a sublattice interact only with those belonging to the other
sublattice. That is, the molecular ﬁeld acting on the dipoles of the sublattice 1 is due
to the dipoles of sublattice 2 and vice versa. The negative sign induces an antiparallel
dipole alignment between different sublattices.
Equations (14.10) and (14.11) introduced by N´eel can be derived from the
following molar Helmholtz free energy

Taking into account that H1 D H2 D H=2, because H D 0, the results (14.10)
and (14.11) follows directly from these equations.
To determine the magnetizations of the sublattices, we should solve the equations
(14.10) and (14.11) for m1 and m2. When H D 0, it is easy to see that the solution
is such that m1 D m2 and that the order parameter  D m1 D m2 obeys the

both members of equations (14.10) and (14.11) with respect to H, we obtain two

As we see from (14.21), the value predicted by the N´eel theory for the exponent ˇ
is 1/2. Experimentally, however, the observed values are different and are shown in
Table 14.2 for various antiferromagnetic compounds.
Other exponents can be deﬁned for the phase transition between paramagnetic
and antiferromagnetic phase. The exponent ˛ is related to the molar heat capacity
cH, which behaves according to
cH  jTN  T j˛;
(14.24)
with ˛ > 0 for the case where cH diverges. If cH is ﬁnite at the critical temperature,
with the value c0, then the behavior is given by
c0  cH  jTN  T j˛;
(14.25)
where, in this expression, ˛ < 0. Table 14.2 shows the value of this exponent for
various antiferromagnetic compounds. Note that for some compounds ˛ is positive
and for others ˛ is negative.
The critical exponent , also shown in Table 14.2, governs the critical behavior
of the susceptibility  associated to the order parameter  and deﬁned by  D
@=@H. It is possible to show from the N´eel theory that the exponent  is equal
to 1. The experimental values are distinct from those predicted by the N´eel theory,
as seen in Table 14.2.
The susceptibility  of antiferromagnetic systems must be distinguished from
the susceptibility  D @m=@H, related to the magnetization m. The susceptibility
 is ﬁnite, as predicted by the N´eel theory. However, the N´eel temperature does
not correspond to a maximum of . According to Fisher, the N´eel temperature
corresponds to the inﬂection point in the susceptibility , which occurs just below
the maximum of , as seen in Fig. 14.2. Yet according to Fisher, near the critical
point,  is related to the molar heat capacity as follows
@

(14.26)
from which we conclude that the singular part of  is governed by the exponent

Metamagnetic Systems
14.2.1
Free Energy
The behavior of antiferromagnetic systems in the presence of an external ﬁeld
is very different from that observed in ferromagnetic systems. In the latter, an
external ﬁeld no matter how small destroys the phase transition. In antiferromagnetic
systems, by contrast, the transition is still present, unless the ﬁeld is high enough.
The different behaviors are due to the role of H with respect to the order parameter.
In ferromagnetic systems, H is the ﬁeld conjugate to the order parameter. In
antiferromagnetic systems that role is reserved to the staggered ﬁeld H and not
the external ﬁeld H.
An antiferromagnetic system subject to an external ﬁeld can display a phase
diagram containing various types of magnetic ordering. In order to determine the
phase diagram in the space H versus T we start from the following molar Helmholtz

where 
12 > 0 and 
11  0 are parameters and m1 and m2 are the magnetizations
of the sublattices. The ﬁrst term is the interaction between magnetic dipoles located
in different sublattices and favors the antiparallel alignment of them. The second is
the interaction between magnetic dipoles located on the same sublattice and favors
the parallel alignment of them. Considering that the sublattices are equivalent, the
free energy is invariant by permutation of m1 and m2.
Several systems are described by the antiferromagnetic free energy (14.27).
When 
11 D 0, we recover the expression (14.12), which describes a simple
antiferromagnetic system, consisting of two interpenetrating sublattices. When

11 > 0, the free energy (14.27) describes metamagnetic systems that are anti-
ferromagnetic systems consisting of magnetic layers. The odd layers constitute one
sublattice and the even layers the other sublattice. The interaction between layers
is antiferromagnetic. Within the layer the interaction is ferromagnetic. Examples of

These two equations of state implicitly provide m and  as functions of T and
H. The solutions are of two types: (a)  D 0, corresponding to the paramagnetic
state, (b)  ¤ 0, corresponding to the antiferromagnetic state. This type of solution
appears in pairs, since the equations of state are invariant under the change of
sign of . Thus the antiferromagnetic region is a region of coexistence of two
antiferromagnetic phases, deﬁned by  and , nonzero.
14.2.2
Tricritical Point
The two kinds of solution divide the phase diagram into two regions, as shown in
Fig. 14.3a for the case 
11 D 2
12. The line separating the two regions corresponds
to a continuous phase transition or critical line for low ﬁeld. For high ﬁelds, it
corresponds to a discontinuous phase transition in which three phases coexist: the
paramagnetic and two antiferromagnetic. The point separating the continuous and
discontinuous transitions is the tricritical point where the three phases become
identical.
The critical line occurs when the nonzero solution  ! 0. Dividing both sides
of (14.31) by  and taking the limit  ! 0, we get

To determine the line of coexistence of three phases we must look to the
thermodynamic potential  given by (14.29), which is a function of thermodynamic
ﬁelds only and therefore, at the coexistence of phases, has the same value in each
phase. Denoting by mp and ma the magnetizations corresponding to the solutions
paramagnetic ( D 0) and antiferromagnetic ( ¤ 0) of the equations (14.30)
and (14.31), then the condition for coexistence is given by
f .T; ma; /  Hma D f .T; mp; 0/  Hmp:
(14.35)
Thus, we determine the coexistence line in the diagram H versus T , shown in

Therefore, this condition together with the equations of the critical line (14.32)

the existence of tricritical point is

transition line is reduced to a critical line only.
The magnetization m as a function of temperature for constant H is shown in
Fig. 14.3b. Deﬁning the variable  D mp  ma, then it is possible to show that along
the coexistence of three phases,  behaves near the tricritical point according to

system are shown in Fig. 14.4.

system which are reﬂected in the symmetries of the free energy. In antiferromagnetic
systems, the equivalence of sublattices implies that the free energy is invariant by
permutation of the magnetization of sublatticess or, equivalently, invariant by the
change of sign of the order parameter .
According to Landau theory, we postulate for the molar free energy g.T; H; /,
deﬁned by (14.7), the following form
g D a0 C a22 C a44 C a66;
(14.38)
which is an even function of  due to the symmetry g.T; H; / D g.T; H; /. The
parameters ai are linear functions of T and H and a6 is strictly positive. As the
staggered ﬁeld H D @g=@ vanishes then according to (14.9), the order parameter
 corresponds to an absolute minimum of the polynomial (14.38).
The number of coexisting phases equals the number of absolute minima of g.
To determine the conditions for existence of a certain number of minima, it is
convenient to write the free energy in the form
g D g0 C a6 ./;
(14.39)
where g0 is the value of the absolute minimum and  ./ is a polynomial of sixth
degree in . Thus, the minima of g become the double roots of  ./.
Since  is a pair polynomial of sixth-degree, then we can have at most three
phases in coexistence. Initially, we determine the conditions for the coexistence of
three phases. For this to occur it is necessary that

(14.42)
The three phases in coexistence are:  D 0, the paramagnetic phase, and  D ˙0,
the two antiferromagnetic phases.
A critical line (two identical phases) is described by a polynomial  having a
quadruple root, that is,  D 4.2 C a2/, from which we conclude that
a2 D 0
and
a4 > 0:
(14.43)
Finally, the tricritical point (three identical phases) corresponds to a sixfold root so
that  D 6, from which follows a4 D a2 D 0. The phase diagram in space a2
versus a4 is shown in Fig. 11.11a.
To determine the magnetization m D @g=@H, we assume that the coefﬁcients
ai depend linearly on T and H. Thus up to quadratic order in  we obtain m D
c0  c22, where c0 and c2 are constant. On the three-phase coexistence line, the

The calculations developed in the previous sections are appropriate for a system
with uniaxial anisotropy, that is, such that the magnetizations of the sublattices
are parallel to the preferred direction determined by the crystalline anisotropy and
applied ﬁeld along the preferred direction. For a more general treatment that takes
into account both applied ﬁelds in other directions and the possible emergence of
magnetization in other directions, we start with the following molar Helmholtz free

corresponds to the maximum anisotropy. We consider here the anisotropic case,
0   < 1, so that the spontaneous magnetization of the sublattices will emerge
along the preferential axis z.
If the external ﬁeld is applied along the z direction, then m1x D m1y D
m2x D m2y D 0 and the expression (14.46) is reduced to (14.12). The results

Phase Diagram
Let us determine next the possible thermodynamic phases predicted by the free
energy (14.46) for the ﬁeld H applied along the preferential axis. In addition to the
paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases, a system described by (14.46) exhibits
a new magnetic phase, as seen in the phase diagram of Fig. 14.5. This phase, called
spin ﬂop, is such that the magnetizations of the sublattices point to directions
distinct from that of the preferential axis although the applied ﬁeld is parallel to
the preferential direction. The phase transitions from the antiferromagnetic state to
the paramagnetic state and from the spin ﬂop state to the paramagnetic state are
continuous. However, the transition from the antiferromagnetic state to the spin ﬂop
state is discontinuous. The phase diagram has two critical lines and one coexistence
line, as seen in Fig. 14.5 and 14.6.
To determined the phase diagram, it is more convenient to consider the thermo-
dynamic potential , which is function only of the thermodynamic ﬁelds, given by

for  D 0:75. The meeting point of the three lines determine the bicritical point.
14.3.3
Bicritical Point
The bicritical point is located at the end of the coexistence line of the antiferro-
magnetic and spin ﬂop phases. The antiferromagnetic phase is described by the
order parameter  D .m1z  m2z/=2, which vanishes both in the paramagnetic
and the spin ﬂop phases. The spin ﬂop phase can also be deﬁned by an order
parameter !, given by ! D .m1xm2x/=2, which vanishes both in the paramagnetic
and antiferromagnetic phases. Thus the adequate description of the bicritical point
requires the concurrence of two order parameters.
According to the Landau theory, we postulate for the molar Gibbs free energy
g.T; H; ; !/ the following form
g D a00 C a202 C a02!2 C a404 C a222!2 C a04!4;
(14.66)
which is an even function both in  and !. The parameters aij are linear functions
of T and H and a40 and a04 are strictly positive. The conjugate ﬁelds to  and !
must vanish so that, according to (14.9), the order parameters  and ! correspond
to the minima of (14.66).
The possible phase diagrams are shown in Fig. 14.7. For a2
22 < 4a40a04 the
diagram presents three phases: paramagnetic and other two which we identify as
the antiferromagnetic and the spin ﬂop. The transition between the last two are
discontinuous. The other two lines are continuous transition and they meet at the
bicritical point. For a2
22 > 4a40a04, on the other hane, there is a fourth phase,
characterized by  ¤ 0 and ! ¤ 0. In this case the transitions are continuous.
The fout lines meet at a point called tetracritical point.

Ferrimagnetism
14.4.1
Ferrimagnetic Materials
The ferrimagnetic materials also order in sublattices that present each of them spon-
taneous magnetization in distinct directions. However, unlike the antiferromagnetic
materials, the sublattices are not equivalent resulting in a non vanishing sum of
the magnetizations. The ferrimagnetic materials present therefore, a spontaneous
magnetization. This is the case of the magnetite, Fe3O4, mineral known since
ancient times by its natural magnetism, which disappears at the temperature of
585 ıC.
Magnetite is the most notorious example of a class of ferrimagnetic materials
known as ferrites which have chemical formula MFe2O4 where M is a divalent metal
and has the same crystalline structure of spinel. The properties of some ferrites are
presented in Table 14.3. In these compounds, the metalic ions, are located in two
types of sites, denoted by A and B, that constitute the two nonequivalent sublattices.
The site of type A is surrounded by four oxygen atoms located at the vertices of a
tetrahedron whereas site B is surrounded by six oxygen atoms located at the vertices
of an octahedron. The number of atoms of type B is equal to twice the number of
atoms of type A.
Another class of ferrimagnetic materials is that constituted by the compounds
with the same crystalline structure of the garnet described by the chemical formula
M3Fe5O12, where M is a trivalent metal and Fe is the trivalent ferric ion. The
properties of some ferrimagnetic garnets are presented in Table 14.3 and in
Fig. 14.8a. The garnet of iron and yttrium, Y3Fe5O12, is particularly interesting
because the only magnetic ions are the ferric ions. The total magnetization is the
result of the sum of opposite magnetizations corresponding to the two sublattices
with distinct number of magnetic atoms. This compound loses the spontaneous
magnetization at the temperature of 287 ıC. At room temperature, the magnetization

Let us consider the simplest case of a ferrimagnetic system in which the magnetic
lattice is divided into two sublattice, in general not equivalent. The total molar
magnetization is the wighted mean of the magnetization of sublattices 1 and 2,

(14.67)
where p and q D 1  p are the mole fractions of the magnetic atoms that are in

critical temperature Tc, as seen in Fig. 14.8b. However, this point does not represent
any phase transition. Experimentally, this point is indeed observed, as shown in

Dielectric Materials
15.1.1
Ordinary Dielectrics
Dielectric materials are insulators characterized by the response to an electric ﬁeld.
An ordinary dielectric, such as water, placed in the presence of an electric ﬁeld
acquires an electric polarization that disappears when the ﬁeld is removed. For small
values of the applied electric ﬁeld E, the polarization (electric dipole moment per
unit volume) of an ordinary dielectric is proportional to the ﬁeld, that is,
P D NE;
(15.1)
where N is the constant of proportionality. If an ordinary dielectric is placed between
the plates of a capacitor, the capacitance increases by a factor . This factor, which
is the dielectric constant is related to N by means of
N D 0.  1/;
(15.2)
where 0 is the permittivity of vacuum. The dielectric constant  is a characteristics
of the dielectric substance and in general depends on the temperature. The dielectric
constant of water at room temperature is equal to 80.
The electric polarization of a dielectric substance is due to the molecular
microscopic dipoles of the molecules. Such molecular dipoles can be permanent,
as happens with polar molecules, or can be induced by the applied ﬁeld. In a
dielectric composed of non-polar molecules, the polarization is only due to the effect
of electrical induction, and therefore should disappear when the ﬁeld vanish. In a
dielectric composed by molecules with permanent dipole moment, the polarization
also vanishes in the absence of ﬁeld, but this is due to thermal agitation, which
causes a disordering of the electric dipoles. The dipoles point to arbitrary directions

15.1.2
Ferroelectrics
Ferroelectrics are materials that have a polarization even in the absence of an applied
electric ﬁeld. This spontaneous polarization generally decreases with increasing
temperature and disappears above a temperature, called transition temperature T0,
as shown in Fig. 15.1. Above the transition temperature the material becomes
paraelectric. In this state the polarization behaves according to (15.1), that is, the
material becomes an ordinary dielectric: the polarization arises if we apply an
electric ﬁeld and disappears if we turn off the ﬁeld. Rochelle salt or potassium
sodium tartrate tetrahydrate (NaKC4H4O64H2O), the substance in which ferroelec-
tricity has been observed for the ﬁrst time, is ferroelectric at room temperature, but
loses polarization spontaneously if heated above 24 ıC. Above this temperature, it
becomes paraelectric. Interestingly, the Rochelle salt also ceases to be ferroelectric
below 18 ıC. Other ferroelectric materials are listed on Table 15.1.
The ferroelectric crystals can basically be classiﬁed into two groups. In the ﬁrst
group are those consisting of permanent dipoles. The transition to the ferroelectric
state occurs through the ordering of the permanent dipoles and so the transition
is of the order-disorder type. In the second group are those consisting of induced
dipoles. The transition to the ferroelectric is due to the relative displacement of two
sublattices, one composed by anions and the other by cations.
The crystals of the ﬁrst group are represented by potassium dihydrogen phos-
phate (KH2PO4) or KDP. In this substance phosphate groups are connected by
hydrogen bonds. Each hydrogen ion can be located near one or the other of two

phosphate groups, which determines the orientation of the dipole attached to it. The
ordering of the dipoles, which characterizes the ferroelectric state, is a consequence
of the ordering of hydrogen ions. At high temperatures, thermal agitation causes
the disordering of hydrogen ions and therefore of the dipoles, which characterizes
the paraelectric state. To observe the ferroelectric state in KDP it is necessary to
reduce its temperature below 150 ıC. Other representatives of this group are the
triglycine sulphate ((NH2CH2COOH)3H2SO4) or TGS and triglycine ﬂuoberyllate
((NH2CH2COOH)3H2BeF4) or TGFB whose spontaneous polarizations are shown
in Fig. 15.1a as functions of temperature.

Dielectrics
The ferroelectrics of the second group are represented by the barium titanate
(BaTiO3). In this substance there are two sublattices, one of them consisting of
negative ions and the other of positive ions. The ferroelectric state arises by displace-
ment of an entire sublattice in relation to the other. At room temperature BaTiO3 is
ferroelectric and has a tetragonal structure. If heated, it undergoes a transition to
the paraelectric phase, at a temperature of 107 ıC, as shown in Fig. 15.1b, passing
to have a cubic structure. If cooled, however, it passes through two ferroelectric
transitions. One at the temperature of 0 ıC, acquiring the orthorhombic structure,
and another at 90 ıC acquiring the rhombohedral structure. All three transitions
are discontinuous.
The ferroelectric transitions represent a special subclass of the class of structural
transitions which are those in which the crystalline structure undergoes a change.
As an example of a structural transition, we mention the compound SrTiO3 which
undergoes such a transition at a temperature of 110 K. Above this temperature,
the compound has the structure of perovskite. Below that, the compound displays
a structure that is distorted in relation to the original structure. This distortion,
however, does not entail the emergence of a spontaneous polarization in SrTiO3.
If the distortion is accompanied by the emergence of the spontaneous polarization,
then it is also a ferroelectric transition, as happens with the compound BaTiO3. Is
also worth mentioning that some crystals have other types of electrical ordering,
with zero total polarization. Such states are called antiferroelectrics as is the case,
for example, of PbZrO3 crystal.

Dielectric Properties
15.2.1
Electric Work
To study the effects of the electric ﬁeld on a dielectric we use a capacitor within
which the dielectric sample is placed. The capacitor is maintained at a potential
difference which generates an electric ﬁeld within the capacitor. The electric dipole
moment per unit volume or volumetric polarization P and the electric ﬁeld E are
related to the electric displacement D by
D D 0E C P;
(15.3)
where 0 is the permittivity of vacuum. For a uniform electric ﬁeld, we can show
that the inﬁnitesimal work performed on the dielectric dWele is given by
dWele D E  dP
(15.4)
where P is the total electric dipole of the sample.
The demonstration of this result is as follows. Consider a capacitor of parallel
plates of area A and distance between plates equal to ` within which is the dielectric.

15.2
Dielectric Properties
281
The capacitor is maintained at a potential difference equal to V . We assume that
the electric ﬁeld E and the electric displacement D inside the capacitor as well as
the volumetric polarization P are perpendicular to the plates of the capacitor and
neglect border effects. The work dW required to carry a free charge dqliv against the
potential is given by
dW D V dqliv:
(15.5)
But V D E` and the free charges are related to the electric displacement D by
qliv D DA so that
dW D E`AdD D EVdD;
(15.6)
where V D A` is the volume of the capacitor. On the other hand, if the capacitor
was empty the work would be
dW0 D 0EVdE:
(15.7)
Therefore, the electric energy transferred to the electric material inside the capacitor
will be dWele D dW  dW0 or
dWele D EVdP;
(15.8)
or yet
dWele D EdP;
(15.9)
where P D V P is the total electric dipole moment of the sample.
In the International System of Units, the electric dipole moment P is measured
in coulomb meter (C m) and the electric ﬁeld E in volts per meter (V/m). The
electric displacement D and the volumetric polarization P are measured in C/m2.
The electric dipole moment per mole, or molar polarization, is given in C m/mol.
15.2.2
Thermodynamic Potentials and Coefﬁcients
The inﬁnitesimal change in internal energy of a dielectric equals the sum of the heat
introduced dQ D TdS and the work performed on the electrical system dWele D EdP,
that is,
dU D TdS C EdP:
(15.10)
We remark that the total dipole moment P is an extensive quantity. Thus, we may
understand that the internal energy U of a sample of dielectric is a function of the
extensive variables S and P . Taking into account the number of moles N of the
sample, we consider U.S; P; N / to be also a function of N , which represents
the fundamental relation of a dielectric in the energy representation. The entropy
S.U; P; N / is also a fundamental relation for which

the change in temperature is called pyroelectric effect. A measure of this effect is
given by the pyroelectric coefﬁcient deﬁned above.

Debye Law
Let us ﬁrst examine the properties of an ideal dielectric, understood as a system
consisting of noninteracting microscopic dipoles or such that the interactions are
negligible. Examples of such systems are gases at low pressures. In this state, the
molecules are sufﬁciently far from each other so that the electric ﬁeld acting on a
molecule, due to the another, can be neglected when compared with the applied
ﬁeld. The molar polarization p of an ideal dielectric is composed of two parts:
an induced, p1, and another, p2, permanent. The induced part is independent of
temperature and simply proportional to the applied electric ﬁeld
p1 D ˛E;
(15.26)
where ˛ is the molar polarizability. The permanent part depends on the temperature.
By analogy with ideal paramagnetism we postulate the following form due to
Langevin

(15.27)

For small values of the electric ﬁeld, the expression in parentheses behaves as
p0E=3RT, so that the polarization varies with the ﬁeld in accordance with
p D 0E;
(15.29)
where
0 D ˛ C p2

(15.30)
which is the Debye law. The second term, which is analogous to the Curie law,
corresponds to the contribution of permanent dipoles. The ﬁrst term is due to
induced dipoles that may also be present in the polar molecules.
In an ordinary dielectric, as we have seen, the relation between the volumetric
polarization (dipole moment per unit volume) P and the ﬁeld is P D NE. Given
that the dipole moment per unit volume P and dipole moment per mole p are
connected by p D vP, where v is the molar volume, then 0 D v N, from which
follows the relation between 0 and the dielectric constant 
0 D v0.  1/:
(15.31)
Thus we see that 0 can be experimentally determined from the measurement of
dielectric constant and the molar volume.
Replacing (15.31) into (15.30), Debye law can be written in the form

Figure 15.2 shows .  1/v versus 1=T for various gases. By Debye law (15.32),
the slope of the straight line ﬁtted to the experimental data gives the permanent
polarization p0.
The dense gases as well as the liquids and solids deviate from ideal behavior
and Debye law ceases to be valid. In these states, due to the proximity between
molecules, one can not neglect the mutual action between the dipoles. A dipole does
not feel only the external ﬁeld but also the ﬁeld generated by the other molecule
dipoles. An approximate form for the dielectric properties of these systems is that
given by the Clausius-Mossotti relation, which is obtained by replacing the ﬁeld E
in (15.29) by E C P=30, where the second term is the Lorentz ﬁeld. With the

Discontinuous Transition
To explain the transition between paraelectric and the ferroelectric phases occurring
in barium titanate, Devonshire postulated the following expression for the molar
Helmholtz free energy
f D f0 C b.T  T1/p2  cp4 C dp6;
(15.35)
where the constants b, c, d and T1 are positive and f0 depends only on temperature.
The negative coefﬁcient of p4 guarantees that the transition is discontinuous as we
will see below. The coefﬁcient of p2 can be either positive or negative according to
whether T > T1 or T < T1.
The electric ﬁeld E D .@f=@p/T is given by
E D 2b.T  T1/p  4cp3 C 6dp5;
(15.36)
and the susceptibility  D .@p=@E/T is given by

Expression (15.35) is not always convex in p. In the cases where it is not
convex, the free energy of the system should be understood as the convex hull of
expression (15.35) obtained by the minimization of f  Ep.
At zero ﬁeld, E D 0, the thermodynamic properties are therefore obtained by
the minimization of expression (15.35). That is, the polarization corresponds to the
absolute minimum of (15.35).
In the paraelectric phase p D 0 is an absolute minimum of f . In the ferroelectric
phase, the absolute minimum occurs at p D p, where p is the spontaneous
polarization, which is the solution of (15.36) for E D 0, that is,

If the system described by (15.35) is subject to an electric ﬁeld, the phase
transition does not disappear but is displaced to another value of temperature as long
as the ﬁeld does not exceed a certain value Ec. For ﬁelds above Ec the transition
disappears. Thus the phase diagram E versus T has a discontinuous transition line

Continuous Transition
The majority of ferroelectric substances pass to the paraelectric phase through a
ﬁrst order transition as happens, for example, with the barium titanate. Some fer-
roelectrics, however, undergoes a continuous transition. According the Devonshire
theory, the free energy of such systems is given by
f D f0 C b.T  Tc/p2 C cp4;
(15.53)
where the constants b and c are positive and f0 depends only on temperature.

Ferroelectric Transitions
In addition to the transition between the paraelectric and ferroelectric phases which
occurs at 107 ıC, the barium titanate undergoes two more transitions that occur
at 0 ıC and at 90 ıC. These transitions are discontinuous and occur among
ferroelectric phases. In the paraelectric phase the barium titanate has cubic crystal
structure. In the ferroelectric phases the structures are tetragonal, orthorhombic and
rhombic.
The three discontinuous phase transitions occurring in BaTiO3 can be obtained
from the following free energy

which we have used previously to describe the ferroelectric to paraelectric transition.

Order-Disorder Transition
15.4.1
Hydrogen Bonds
In ferroelectric materials such that the hydrogen bonds have a relevant role, the fer-
roelectric state is described by the ordering of the hydrogen ions and consequently
by the ordering of the permanent dipoles which result in a spontaneous polarization.
In the paraelectric phase the dipoles are disordered so that the polarization vanishes.
Among ferroelectrics whose mechanism of transition is of the type order-disorder
we ﬁnd the potassium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate (KH2PO4) or KDP and its
isomorphs and the triglycine sulfate, (NH2CH2COOH)3H2SO4, and its isomorphs.
In analogy with ferromagnetic systems we postulate the following free energy

Isotopic Effect
An important effect observed in phase transitions of compounds of the KDP type is
that the critical temperature becomes approximately twice greater when hydrogen is
replaced by deuterium, called isotopic effect. This means that the quantum tunneling
of the hydrogen between two equilibrium positions located at the hydrogen bonds
has a relevant role. When deuterium, which has a larger mass, replaces hydrogen,the
tunneling becomes less frequent causing a greater stability of the ferroelectric state.
According to de Gennes the tunneling corresponding to the model introduced by
Blind can be written by means of a transverse ﬁeld, that is, by means of a ﬁeld that
acts perpendicularly to the direction of the electric dipoles. This ﬁeld give rise to
a polarization in the transversal direction, which we denote by q. Thus in analogy
with a ferromagnetic system in the presence of perpendicular ﬁeld we postulate the
following free energy
f D ˛

In fact, the free energy must be understood as the convex hull of the right hand side
of equation (15.73) which is equivalent to minimize the expression f  Ep   q
where  is the transverse ﬁeld.
The transverse ﬁeld  D @f=@q is given by

Slater-Takagi Theory
As we have seen, the ferroelectric state of KDP is related with the ordering of the
protons located at the hydrogen bonds that connect the phosphate groups. Each
phosphate group is represented by a tetrahedron which is characterized according to
the conﬁgurations of the protons in its four vertices. To each one of the 16 possible
conﬁgurations of protons in the vertices of the tetrahedron, the Slater-Takagi theory
associates a certain dipole moment and a certain energy as follows. Among the six
conﬁgurations that have two protons, four have moment equal to zero and energy 0,

15.4
Order-Disorder Transition
293
one has moment equal to C2	 and energy zero and one has moment equal to 2	
and energy zero. Among the eight conﬁgurations that have one or three protons, four
have moment equal to C	 and energy 1 and four have moment equal to 	 and
energy 1. The other conﬁgurations are forbidden.
The molar Gibbs free energy g.T; E/ is determined by
g D min
p ff  Epg;
(15.84)
where the molar Helmholtz free energy f and the molar polarization p depend on
the mole fractions of each type of conﬁgurations of the tetrahedrons. According to
Ishibashi, the molar Helmholtz free energy f that is obtained from the Slater-Takagi
theory is given by
f D u  Ts;
(15.85)
where u is the molar energy, given by
u D 40c0 C 41.dC C d/;

where c0, cC, c, dC and d are the mole fractions of each type of conﬁguration of
the tetrahedrons and are connected by the relation
4c0 C cC C c C 4dC C 4d D 1:
(15.88)
The polarization p is given by
p D Œ.cC  c/ C 2.dC  d/p0;
(15.89)
where p0 is the saturation polarization.
At zero ﬁeld, which interest us here, g is obtained by the minimization of the
expression (15.85) for f , subjected to the restriction (15.88). The minimization
leads to the following results
c0 D c1=2

The transition from the ferroelectric phase to the paraelectric phase occurs
when the expressions (15.94) and (15.96) for the Gibbs free energy become equal.
The equality between them leads to the following expression for the transition
temperature T0
2e0=RT0 C 2e1=RT0 D 1:
(15.97)
The original Slater theory corresponds to the case in which only the six conﬁgura-
tions with two protons are allowed. The others are forbidden what is equivalent
to saying that 1
! 1 (1 D 0). In this case the ferroelectric phase has
constant polarization p D p0 for any temperature T < T0 and the transition
temperature is given by RT0=0 D 1= ln 2. When 1 is ﬁnite, which corresponds to
the Slater-Takagi theory, the polarization decreases with temperature and vanishes
continuously at the transition temperature T0.
It is worth mentioning that the Slater theory (1 D 0), for the case in which
0 D 0 (0 D 1), is reduced to the theory introduced by Pauling to explain the
residual entropy of ordinary ice. In this case, the six allowed conﬁgurations of
the tetrahedron are associated to the same energy and the system exhibits only
the paraelectric phase. From (15.94) we see that g D RT ln.3=2/, from which we
conclude that s D @g=@T D R ln.3=2/ which is the result due to Pauling for the
residual entroy of the ordinary ice.

16.1.1
Anisotropy
A solid substance is characterized by having a spatial structure consisting of a three-
dimensional lattice at whose vertices the atoms are located. Because the atoms are
in continuous motion due to thermal agitation, the vertices of the lattice are deﬁned,
more properly, as the equilibrium positions around which the atoms vibrate. This
structure gives to the solid the rigidity that opposes not only the compression and
stretch but also shear. In other words, offering resistance to the volume and shape
changes. The spatial structures can be ordered as those of the crystalline solid or
disordered such as those of the amorphous solids and glasses.
Crystal structures are classiﬁed according to the symmetries they exhibit. The set
of symmetry operations of a crystalline structure comprises a symmetry group. The
symmetry groups are brought together in classes and the classes in crystal systems.
There are seven crystal systems: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal,
trigonal, hexagonal and cubic. The structures of the cubic system can be simple
cubic (sc), body-centered cubic (bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc). In a simple
solid, composed of one kind of atom, that orders according to the sc structure,
the atoms are located only at the vertices of the cubes forming the ordered spatial
structure. In a simple solid with ccc structure the atoms are at the vertices and at the
centers of the cubes and in a simple solid with fcc structure, they lie at the vertices
and centers of the sides of the cubes.
Due to the spatially ordered structure, crystalline solids, in contrast to gases and
liquids, are anisotropic. Elasticity may depend on the direction along which the solid
is pulled or compressed. The thermal expansion on a direction may differ from that
on a different direction. It should be noted that variations in properties arising from
the anisotropy are observed in single crystals. Polycrystals, and the amorphous and
glassy solids, are from the macroscopic point of view, examples of isotropic solids.

This does not mean that they behave, as to the elastic properties, like liquids and
gases, which are also isotropic. Solids, isotropic or not, are distinguished from ﬂuids
by resisting shear.
16.1.2
Stress Tensor
External forces acting on the surface of a solid can induce the appearance of
stress and shear inside the solid. In a ﬂuid external forces only induce hydrostatic
compressions and possibly internal motions. The hydrostatic compressions are
forces perpendicular to the surface of any internal region and have the same
magnitude per unit area at any point on the surface. In a solid, in general, the forces
on an internal region are not perpendicular to the surface and do not have the same
magnitude per unit area. This complexity of the forces requires a more detailed
description of the mechanical equilibrium than that given simply by hydrostatic
compression. The internal forces in a solid are described by means of a quantity
similar to the pressure, called stress. Unlike pressure, which is a scalar, stress is a
tensor quantity and is deﬁned as follows.
Consider a sample of a solid in the form of a rectangular parallelepiped of edges
`1, `2 and `3, with edges parallel to a Cartesian coordinate system, as shown in
Fig. 16.1a. We denote by E
f1, E
f2 and E
f3 the forces acting on the faces A, B and C,
respectively. The forces acting on opposite sides are, respectively,  E
f1,  E
f2 and  E

so that the resultant of the forces on the sample is zero. The decomposition of these

deﬁnes the Cartesian components fij of these vectors. Since the sample is in
mechanical equilibrium torques on it should vanish. This requirement applied to
each of the three Cartesian axes results in the following condition
`ifij D `jfji:
(16.4)
In order to describe efforts which are independent of sample size, what can be
done by considering homogeneous samples, we introduce forces per unit area
ij D fij
Ai
;
(16.5)
where Ai are the area of the three faces of the parallelepiped, given by A1 D `2`3,
A2 D `3`1 and A3 D `1`2. They have the unit of pressure and comprise the elements
of a tensor  called stress tensor. The diagonal elements describe the stretches and
are positive in a proper stretch and negative in a compression. The off-diagonal
elements describe the shear stresses. Due to property (16.4) we see that
ij D ji;
(16.6)
which means that the stress tensor is symmetrical.
The stress tensor can be decomposed into a tensor of zero trace and a tensor that
represents a hydrostatic compression. Indeed, from the identity
ij D .ij C pıij/  pıij;
(16.7)
where p D .11 C 22 C 33/=3, we see that the tensor represented by the ﬁrst
term has zero trace. The second term constitutes the components of a tensor that
has only diagonal elements and are all equal. This second tensor, deﬁned by pıij,
represents a hydrostatic compression at a pressure p since the forces E
fi that describe
a hydrostatic compression are perpendicular to the faces of the parallelepiped of
Fig. 16.1a and are proportional to the areas of the faces, that is, fij D pAiıij.
16.1.3
Strain Tensor
The description of the mechanical state of a sample of a solid can not be made
only by its volume as happens to a ﬂuid in thermodynamic equilibrium. Due to
anisotropy, the deformations resulting from forces of the same intensity may have
different magnitudes and may depend on the direction of the forces. In other words,
the deformations are not isotropic. To properly describe the mechanical state of a
solid we introduce a quantity called strain tensor, deﬁned as follows.
Consider again the sample of a homogeneous solid in the form of a rectangular
parallelepiped with edges `1, `2, and `3, as shown in Fig. 16.1a. Then consider a

deformation of this body as shown in Fig. 16.1b. The lengths and directions of edges
of the parallelepiped are described by the vectors E`1, E`2 and E`3, whose Cartesian
decomposition
E`1 D `11 Ox C `12 Oy C `13Oz;
(16.8)
E`2 D `21 Ox C `22 Oy C `23Oz;
(16.9)
E`3 D `31 Ox C `32 Oy C `33Oz;
(16.10)
deﬁne the Cartesian components `ij of these vectors.
In order to describe the deformation of the sample regardless of size we introduce
the relative displacements ij deﬁned by
`ij D `i.ıij C ij/:
(16.11)
They are dimensionless and comprise the elements of a tensor  called strain tensor.
The diagonal elements describe stretch deformations and the off-diagonal elements
describe shear deformations. Given that the sample is homogeneous, the strain
tensor does not depend on the size of the sample used to determine it. The volume
V0 of the region before the deformation is
V0 D `1`2`3:
(16.12)
After deformation the volume V is
V D jE`1  E`2  E`3j:
(16.13)
The mechanical state of a solid body in equilibrium is deﬁned not only by the
strain tensor  but also by a reference state from which we deﬁne this tensor. We
adopt as the reference state a rectangular parallelepiped of edges `1, `2 and `3 like
that shown in Fig. 16.1a. Any other state, like the one shown in Fig. 16.1b, is deﬁned
by the vectors E`1, E`2 and E`3, which are related to the strain tensor and the reference
state by means of (16.11).
The components of the strain tensor describe deformations of any magnitude.
However, elastic deformations of a solid body are small in general which allows us
to restrict ourselves to the study of the case in which the components of the strain
tensor is small compared with the unit, that is, ij 	 1. In this regime of small strain
the sample volume, given by (16.13) reduces to
V D V0.1 C 11 C 22 C 33/;
(16.14)
expression valid up to linear terms in ij and depends only on the diagonal
components of the strain tensor.
An equivalent description of the mechanical state of a solid in equilibrium can
be made through the variable V given by (16.14) together with the variables ij
deﬁned by

(16.15)
which constitute the components of the tensor . This tensor has zero trace and for
this reason only two of its diagonal components can be chosen as independent. In a
process in which the volume remains constant, it describes the change in shape.
16.1.4
Work of Elastic Forces
To determine the work of elastic forces we look at the forces E
f1, E
f2 and E
f3 acting on
the faces A, B and C, whose Cartesian components are deﬁned by (16.1), (16.2)
and (16.3). The forces acting on opposite faces are considered to be equal in
magnitude but in opposite directions. These forces are related to the stress tensor
in accordance with
fij D Aiij;
(16.16)
where Ai are the areas of the projections of the faces of the oblique parallelepiped
of Fig. 16.1b on the three planes of the Cartesian system. As we are in the regime
of small deformations the areas of the sides A, B and C can be approximated by
A1 D `2`3, A2 D `3`1 and A3 D `1`2.
To determine the work of forces we consider the displacements of the faces. Since
the forces acting on opposite faces are antiparallel, we assume that the displace-
ments of the faces are antiparallel. Denoting by d E`i=2 the inﬁnitesimal displacement
of a face, on which acts the force E
fi, then the inﬁnitesimal displacement of the
opposite face will be d E`i=2 and will be subject to a force  E

When the stress tensor  corresponds to a hydrostatic pressure, that is, ij D pıij,
we see that the work is reduced to dW D pdV, which is the form used in gases
and liquids.
Given that the strain tensor is symmetric, there are only six independent
components of the tensor. The expression for the work will have as a consequence

Elastic Coefﬁcients
Several thermodynamic coefﬁcients are used to characterize the thermodynamic
properties of solids. These coefﬁcients are similar to those used in the description of
gases and liquids such as the compressibility, the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion
and heat capacity. The coefﬁcients that describe the elasticity relate the variations
of stress and variations in strain in the form of quotients. The isothermal stiffness

The coefﬁcient ij is not generally the inverse of cij. However, they are closely

it follows cij D cji. Similarly we may conclude that ij D ji. Therefore, from
the 36 coefﬁcients cij, or ij, only 21 are independent. The number of independent
coefﬁcients can be further reduced if we take into account the symmetries of the
crystalline structure.
The triclinic system does not impose any restriction and has therefore 21
independent coefﬁcients. However, in this case it is possible to orient the sample
such that 3 coefﬁcients vanish reducing the number of independent coefﬁcients
to 18. In the monoclinic system, the number of independent coefﬁcients is 13 but
the orientation of the sample can reduce them to 12. In the orthorhombic system
the number is nine. Some classes of the trigonal and tetragonal systems have seven
independent coefﬁcients but they may be reduced to six by the orientation of the
sample. Other classes of these two systems have six independent coefﬁcients. The
hexagonal system has ﬁve and cubic system has only three.
In the cubic system we take as independent c11, c12 and c44. The other are
given by
c33 D c22 D c11;
c23 D c13 D c12;

A solid body immersed in a liquid undergoes compression which are perpendicular
to its surface and of the same intensity anywhere in the surface. Under these
conditions the solid body undergoes a hydrostatic compression represented by the

(16.43)
where the derivative is carried out by keeping all the six stress components j ﬁxed.
Recalling that the stress tensor is symmetric, we can make a rotation of the Cartesian
axes so as to transform the stress tensor in diagonal form. From this result we
conclude that only three coefﬁcients of expansion are independent. This happens
with crystalline solids of the systems triclinic, monoclinic and orthorhombic. Solids
of the tetragonal, trigonal and hexagonal crystalline systems have greater symmetry
and are described by two independent coefﬁcients of expansion. The crystalline
solids of the cubic system, the highest symmetry, are described by only one
coefﬁcient of expansion and accordingly behave like isotropic solids. Therefore, for
a solid cubic symmetry, ˛1 D ˛2 D ˛3. An immediate consequence of this result is
that thermal expansion of polycrystalline samples of cubic structure do not produce
tensions between monocrystalline grains because each expands isotropically. In
contrast, the thermal expansion of polycrystalline samples of noncubic structure
causes internal tensions because the monocrystalline grains expand in distinct forms
along a same direction.

Hooke Law
Consider a sample of a crystalline solid in a nondeformed state at a temperature T0,
that is, such that the stresses and compressions are absent. This nondeformed state
is described by the vanishing of the strain components, which we consider to be the
reference state. Next we consider a deformation of the sample which passes to a be
in a state deﬁned by the strain components i and temperature T .
Assuming the strain to be small, that is, such that i 	 1, we expand the free

16.2.5
Isotropic Solids
We have seen that the compliance coefﬁcients that describe a crystalline solid
are not all independent. Each crystal system imposes constraints arising from the
symmetries that reduce the number of the independent coefﬁcients. The lowest
number is three and corresponds to the crystal system with highest symmetry which
is the cubic system. The isotropic solids impose an additional restriction reducing
the number to only two. Many solid behave as isotropic with respect to the elastic
properties. Examples of isotropic solids include the glassy and amorphous solids
and somehow also the polycrystalline solids.
The relation among the stiffness coefﬁcients are the same as that valid for solids

Structural Phase Transition
16.3.1
Polymorphism
Solids of the same chemical composition but with different crystal structures are
called structural polymorphic forms. Iron, for example, can be found in three
polymorphic forms, known as ˛,  and ı. Phase ˛, or ferrite, has a bcc structure is
the stable phase up to 910 ıC. From this temperature up to 1,400 ıC, the stable phase
is the phase , or austenite, which has a fcc structure. Above 1,400 ıC to the melting
point, which occurs at 1,540 ıC, the stable phase is the phase ı, which is also bcc.
Silica (SiO2) can also be found in various polymorphic forms, among which we
cite quartz, tridymite and cristobalite. The diamond and graphite are polymorphic
forms of carbon. It should be noted that many polymorphic forms are metastable,
some with decay time so great that may be considered stable, as diamond. At
high pressures however diamond becomes stable and graphite metastable. Some
polymorphic forms on the other hand are always metastable, as happens to the phase
of iron-carbon known as martensite, obtained by rapid cooling of austenite.
When subjected to temperature and pressure variations, a solid can undergo
a structural transformation, passing from a polymorphic form to another. The
change in structural form is identiﬁed with a phase transition, but should be
distinguished from that occurring between liquid and vapor. These two phases are
quantitatively different, because they differ by the density, but are qualitatively
similar in structure, because the two are isotropic. This similarity allows for example
the vapor to change continuously into liquid, that is, without undergoing a phase
transition, if it is conducted by an appropriate trajectory in the phase diagram
that bypasses the liquid-vapor critical point. Two phases with different structures
on the other hand are qualitatively distinct because they differ by the symmetries
they display. The passage from one structure to another occurs always through
a phase transition, which is characterized by the occurrence of singularities in
thermodynamic properties.
The structural transitions are governed by different microscopic mechanisms.
The transition of order-disorder type as that which occurs in the copper-zinc alloy
causes a change in crystal structure. The ferroelectric transition of certain substances
such as KH2PO4 or NaNO2 are also of order-disorder type and are accompanied by
a crystallographic change. A structural transition of another kind is that caused by
coordinated movement of atoms of a sublattice of the crystal structure and called
displacive transition. This type of transition can involve two or more sublattices
moving in different directions as happens to SrTiO3. If a sublattice is composed
of ions, its displacement can produce an electric polarization giving rise to a
ferroelectric phase, as with BaTiO3.
Another type of structural transition is that caused by the elastic distortion,
such as with TeO2. This compound undergoes a continuous transition by pressure
increase from a tetragonal structure to an orthorhombic structure. The latter, con-
sidered distorted with respect to the former, is called ferroelastic. The undistorted

16.3
Structural Phase Transition
311
structure is called paraelastic. The class of compounds which undergo this same
type of structural transition includes the compound V3Si, which undergoes a
discontinuous transition from a cubic to a tetragonal structure below 17 K, and the
compound LaNbO4, that undergoes a continuous transition from a tetragonal to a
monoclinic structure below 495 ıC.
16.3.2
Ferroelastic Transition
We wish to analyze here the ferroelastic-paraelastic transition occurring in a crys-
talline solid when the temperature and pressure are varied. To this end we examine
a sample at a given temperature T and subject to a hydrostatic compression p. The
only mechanical stress on the sample is the hydrostatic compression that is to say
the stretch components of the stress are equal and the shear stress components are
zero. Here it is convenient to use the Gibbs potential because these conditions are
naturally satisﬁed when the tensor  takes the values corresponding to minimum of
G./ subject to the constraint 1 C 2 C 3 D 0.
The order parameter of the ferroelastic transition is deﬁned as the tensor . In
the paraelastic phase the tensor  vanishes and in the ferroelastic phase one of its
components becomes nonzero. According to Landau theory, which we adopt here,
the function g./ D G=V0 has a polynomial form and should be invariant under the
symmetry operations corresponding to the paraelastic phase. Since  has trace zero
we use the following parameterization for diagonal components:
1 D 1
2x C
p
3
2 y;
2 D 1
2x 
p
3
2 y;
3 D x:
(16.60)
Initially we consider a transition such that the paraelastic phase has cubic
structure and the ferroelastic phase has tetragonal structure, described by 4 D
5 D 6 D 0. In this case it sufﬁces to consider g as a function of x and y only.
A polynomial of fourth degree with cubic invariance is given by
g D g0 C A1.x2 C y2/ C B1x.x2  3y2/ C C1.x2 C y2/2;
(16.61)
where g0, A1, B1 and C1 depend only on T and p. The free energy g should
be understood as the convex hull of the expression on the right hand side of this
equation. Using the parametrization x D r cos  and y D r sin , r > 0,
g D g0 C A1r2 C B1r3 cos 3 C C1r4:
(16.62)
The minimum of g related to the ferroelastic phase occurs when cos 3 D 1, for
B > 0, and cos 3 D 1, for B < 0. In both cases,
g D g0 C A1r2  jB1jr3 C C1r4;

where r is given by

The three solutions corresponding to the three possible values of  are equivalent,
that is, they have the same value of g and describe a tetragonal structural. The
absolute minimum of g occurs at r D 0 for A1 > A10 D B2
1=4C1 and at a value
r ¤ 0 given by (16.64) for A1 < A10. The transition occurs when A1 D A10 and
corresponds to a discontinuous transition, that is, the order parameter r has a jump
at A1 D A10.
Next we consider the case in which the paraelastic phase has cubic structure and
the ferroelastic phase has trigonal structure, described by 1 D 2 D 3 that is by
x D y D 0. A polynomial of the fourth degree with cubic invariance in the variables
4, 5 and 6 is given by

g D g0 C 3A2z2  jB2jz3 C 3C2z4;
(16.66)
and z is given by
2A2z  jB2jz2 C 4C2z3 D 0:
(16.67)
There are four ferroelastic solutions and they have the same value of g. The absolute
minimum of g occurs at z D 0 for A1 > A10 D B2
1=36C1 and at a value z ¤ 0 given
by (16.67) for A1 < A10. The transition occurs at A1 D A10 and corresponds to a
discontinuous transition, that is, the order parameter z has a jump at A1 D A10.
16.3.3
Devonshire Theory
In the structural transitions of displacive type as those occurring in the compounds
SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, the order parameter is not identiﬁed with the strain tensor .
In displacive transitions, the order parameter is identiﬁed with the vector Eq that
deﬁnes the equilibrium position of a particular atom relative to the equilibrium
position it possessed in the structure of higher symmetry. When the displacement
Eq becomes nonzero it induces the appearance of distortions in the crystalline solid,
characterized by the strain tensor . We therefore assume the existence of a coupling
between the order parameter Eq and the strain tensor . If the displacement Eq gives
rise to a polarization then the phase of lower symmetry is also a ferroelectric phase
with a spontaneous polarization proportional to Eq.
To describe the structural phase transitions we assume that g is a function not
only of T , p and , but also of Eq. The values taken by  and Eq in each phase are those
that minimize g. According to Landau g must be invariant under the operations

16.3

of symmetry of the phase of highest symmetry, which we assume to be the cubic
structure. We assume that the potential g has three terms:
g D gq C ge C ga:
(16.68)
The ﬁrst depends only on Eq and in accordance with Devonshire we suppose that gq is
a polynomial of the sixth degree in qi. Since gq should be invariant by the symmetry
operation Eq $ Eq, the polynomial contains only monomials of even degree. Other
symmetry operations include the permutations among the Cartesian components q1,
q2 and q3 of the vector Eq. The polynomial g contains only one monomial of the
second degree and two monomials of the fourth order. As to monomials of the sixth
order, we consider just one of them, although there are others. In accordance with
these considerations the thermodynamic potential gq reads

Liquid Crystals
17.1
Mesophases
17.1.1
Thermotropics
Liquid crystals are substances which exhibit thermodynamic phases intermediate
between crystalline solid and ordinary liquid, called mesophases, which are distinct
from both ordinary liquid and crystalline solid. They have the property of ﬂuidity,
that characterizes the liquids, and at the same time exhibit the phenomenon of
birefringence, as happens to crystalline solids. Microscopically, the liquid crystals
are distinguished by displaying only one of two types of ordering that characterize
the molecular crystalline solids. In a molecular crystal, the positions of the centers
of the molecules form a spatial ordered structure and in addition the molecules are
ordered as to the orientation. In an ordinary liquid, both positional and orientational
orders are absent. In a liquid crystal molecules have orientational order but
positional order is absent. In the opposite situation to liquid crystals, the molecules
of a plastic crystal exhibit positional order but orientational order is absent.
The shape of the molecules has a fundamental role in the formation of the
orientational order. The packing of rod-shaped molecules, for example, induces the
formation of a structure with orientational order, called nematic, in which the axes
of the molecules become parallel. In fact, the axes of the molecules are not exactly
parallel but ﬂuctuate around a given direction due to thermal agitation.
Several types of mesophases can be found between the crystalline phase and
the ordinary liquid phase, which we call isotropic phase. The simplest mesophase
is called nematic and occurs in the compound p-azoxyanisole (PAA) which is a
solid at room temperature. The transition from solid to the nematic phase occurs
at 118 ıC and from that to the isotropic phase at 135 ıC. A nematic liquid crystal
stable around the room temperature is the compound p-methoxybenzylidene-p-n-
butylaniline (MBBA). This compound passes from the solid to the nematic phase
at 21 ıC and from this phase to the isotropic liquid at 45 ıC. One of the ﬁrst
liquid crystal studied, the cholesteryl benzoate passes from the solid phase to the

Liquid Crystals
mesophase chiral nematic, known also as cholesteric phase, at 145 ıC and from this
phase to the isotropic phase at 178 ıC.
A liquid crystal can display not one but several distinct mesophases. Increasing
the temperature, the compound cholesteryl myristate passes successively through
the phases solid, smectic-A, chiral nematic and isotropic. The transitions occur
at 71 ıC, at 79 ıC and at 85 ıC, respectively. The compound called 4-n-pentyl-
benzenethio-40-n-decyloxybenzoate has three mesophases between the solid and
isotropic phases, that occur in the sequence: smectic-C, smectic-A and nematic.
The transition temperatures from one phase to another are, respectively, 60, 63, 80
and 86 ıC.
The liquid crystals mentioned above are known as thermotropic because the
simplest way to induce the transitions is by varying the temperature. It is important
to note that thermotropic liquid crystals are composed by pure substances. In
another class of liquid crystals, made by mixing two or more pure substances,
the mesophases can arise not only by changing the temperature but especially by
the variation of the concentration of the components of the mixture. Those liquid
crystals are known as lyotropic.
17.1.2
Lyotropics
In general, the lyotropics are formed by long molecules, called amphiphilic, whose
skeleton is a carbon chain and whose ends have opposite behavior in the presence
of water molecules. One end attracts them while the other repels them. When mixed
with water, this behavior favors the development of various types of molecular
structures. The most common among them is the spherical structure called micelle
whose surface is composed by hydrophilic ends of the molecules and whose
central part consists of the hydrophobic ends. The amphiphilic compounds are
also known as surfactants. Two major groups of amphiphiles are saponaceous and
phospholipids. A typical example of the ﬁrst group is the sodium laurate and of the
second group is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine.If the concentration of amphiphilic
water is small, a solution is formed. From a certain concentration, there is the
formation of spherical structures such as micelles or, depending on the type of
amphiphilic, of vesicles. If the concentration increase even more other structures
are formed such as lamellar structure, the cubic structure and hexagonal structure.

Nematics
17.2.1
Order Parameter
The orientational ordering of a sample of a liquid crystal which is in the isotropic
phase can be achieved submitting the sample to non-uniform external forces.

17.2
Nematics
319
Denoting by Fi the Cartesian components of an external force EF that acts at a
point Er with Cartesian components xi, the non-uniformity means that the derivative
ij D @Fi=@xj is nonzero. These forces are irrotational and have zero divergence
which is equivalent to saying that ij have the properties
ji D ij ;
X
i
ii D 0;
(17.1)
and can be understood as the components of a traceless symmetric tensor.
We assume that the sample consists of a set of n constituent units and that
the action of external forces occurs through the dipole moments and quadrupole
moment of the constituent units. A further assumption is that the external forces act
on certain points of each constituent unit and that the density of such points is given
by the function .Er/. From , we deﬁne the Cartesian components pi of the dipole
moment vector,
pi D
Z

(17.2)
and the Cartesian components qij of the quadrupole moment tensor,
qij D

Liquid Crystals
An example of external forces EF having the properties mentioned above are those
generated by an electric ﬁeld. In this case pi and qij are identiﬁed as the electric
dipoles and electric quadrupoles.
The tensorial quantity Q of components Qij deﬁne the order parameter of the
nematic phase. In the absence of external forces, Qij D 0 in the isotropic phase.
In the nematic phase one of the components of Q becomes nonzero even in the
absence of external forces. From the deﬁnition of qij and taking into account that
Qij D nqij , we see that the tensor Q is symmetric and traceless. It is convenient to
use a reference system whose axes are parallel to the singular axes of the nematic
liquid crystal. In this reference system the tensor Q is diagonal and is given by
Q D
0
@
Q1 0
0
0 Q2 0

0 Q3

A ;
(17.8)
where Q1, Q2 and Q3 are the principal components and also the eigenvalues of the
tensor Q. Since the trace is invariant under any rotation of the Cartesian axes then
the trace of Q vanishes.
Q1 C Q2 C Q3 D 0:
(17.9)
When the three principal components are distinct from each other the tensor Q
describes a biaxial nematic phase. When two of them are equal but distinct from the
third, the tensor Q describes a uniaxial nematic phase which can be of rod or disc
type. When all three are equal, and therefore zero, we are faced with the isotropic
phase.
17.2.2
Landau-de Gennes Theory
The theory of Landau-de Gennes describes the transition between the nematic phase
and the isotropic phase. According to this theory, the molar Gibbs free energy must
be invariable by the symmetry operation relating to the isotropic phase. This means
that g.Q1; Q2; Q3/ must be invariant by any permutation of variables Qi. The
theory of Landau-de Gennes assumes that the free energy is a linear combination
of the invariants In of order n. An invariant of order n contains only powers of Qi
of order n.
The invariant of ﬁrst order is identiﬁed with the trace of Q and therefore vanishes
identically. The invariant of second and third order are given by
I2 D Tr Q2;
I3 D Tr Q3:
(17.10)
The other invariants are I4 D I 2
2 , I5 D I2I3, I6 D I 2
3 and I 0
6 D I 3
2 . Notice that there
are two invariants of sixth order. Up to sixth order, the free energy g reads

(17.11)
Notice that the free energy should be understood as the convex hull of the expression
in the right hand side of (17.11). Taking into account that the thermodynamic ﬁeld
conjugate to the variables Qi should vanish, then the thermodynamic states are
identiﬁed as the minima of this expression.
Initially we examine the transition from the isotropic phase to the uniaxial
nematic phase which is described by the tensor Q such that two components are
equal. Assuming that the two components are Q1 and Q2 we can use the following
parameterization Q1 D Q2 D q=2 and Q3 D q. In this case
I2 D 3
2q2;
I3 D 3
4q3;
(17.12)
and using invariants up to fourth order, the function g becomes
g D g0 C 3
2a2q2 C 3
4a3q3 C 9
4a4q4:
(17.13)
We assume that a4 is positive and that a2 is linear with temperature and pressure
and takes positive or negative values. The coefﬁcient a3 is considered to be negative
but the solution for the positive case is obtained from the case a3 < 0 by the
transformation of q into q.
For values of the parameter a2 large enough the absolute minimum of g occurs at
q D 0 which determines the isotropic phase. Decreasing a2, we obtain the nematic
phase for which q ¤ 0. The value of q for the nematic phase corresponds to the
nonzero root of @g=@q D 0, that is,
a2q C 3

The transition from the nematic phase to the isotropic phase is discontinuous
due to the presence of a third order invariant in the free energy g. To determine the
transition temperature which corresponds to the coexistence of phases isotropic and
nematic we impose the following form for the free energy
g D g0 C 9
4a4q2.q  q0/2;

which describes the coexistence between the isotropic phase, q D 0, and the nematic

(17.17)
Thus we can draw the following conclusions. For a2 > a0 D a2
3=24a4, the order
parameter vanishes, and the phase is isotropic. For a2 < a0 the phase is nematic
with q given by (17.15) with a jump equal to q0 at the transition point a2 D a0.
17.2.3
Landau Point
Next we will analyze the possibility of the occurrence of a biaxial nematic phase
characterized by distinct values of Q1, Q2 and Q3. We assume a free energy of the
form (17.11) with a5 D 0 and a0
6 D 0,
g D g0 C a2I2 C a3I3 C a4I 2
2 C a6I 2
3 ;
(17.18)
and such that the coefﬁcients a2 and a3 have linear dependence with temperature and
pressure taking positive or negative values and that a4 and a6 are strictly positive.
Taking into account that Q is a traceless tensor, it is convenient to use the
following parametrization
Q1 D 1
2.q  /;
Q2 D 1
2.q C /;
Q3 D q;
(17.19)
from which we obtain the following results
I2 D 1
2.3q2 C 2/;
I3 D 3
4q.q2  2/:
(17.20)
The minima of g are obtained from @g=@q D 0 and @g=@ D 0.
To determined the transition from the isotropic to a uniaxial we impose the
condition  D 0. In this case I2 D 3q2=2 and I3 D 3q3=4 which replaced in
(17.18) results in the following form for the free energy
g D g0 C 3
2a2q2 C 3
4a3q3 C 9
4a4q4 C 9
16a6q6:
(17.21)
The nematic-isotropic phase transition, which is ﬁrst order, is determined by
comparing (17.21) with a sixth degree polynomial that has two minima with the
same value of g, one at a D 0 (isotropic phase) and the other at q D q0 (uniaxial
nematic phase), which describes the coexistence of the two phases. This comparison

As long as a3 is nonzero, the isotropic phase is contiguous to a uniaxial nematic
phase as seen in Fig. 17.1a and the transition is discontinuous. When a3 D 0,
the transition ceases to be discontinuous, and becomes a continuous transition that
occurs at a2 D 0. The point a2 D 0, a3 D 0 is a special point of the phase diagram
and is called Landau point.
When  becomes nonzero there is the emergence of a biaxial phase. The minima
of g such that  ¤ 0 and q ¤ 0 are determined by

(17.23)
which is obtained by the minimization of the free energy (17.18). Recall that I2

functions of a2 and a3. The transition line from the biaxial nematic to the uniaxial
nematic phases is obtained by taking the limit  ! 0 because this transition is
continuous, what can be understood noticing that g, given by (17.18), contains only
even powers of the order parameter  of the biaxial phase and a4 > 0. Taking the

If the coefﬁcient a5 is nonzero and such that a2
5 < 4a4a6, the phase diagram has
the topology shown in Fig. 17.1a with the critical lines approaching the Landau point
with a certain slope. If a2
5 > 4a4a6 the biaxial phase no longer exists. In this case
the phase diagram exhibits only the two uniaxial phase in addition to the isotropic
phase. The two uniaxial phases become contiguous and the transition between them
is discontinuous. The line of coexistence between the two nematic phase meet the
nematic-isotropic coexistence line at the point a3 D a2 D 0 as seen in Fig. 17.1b.
Notice that in both cases the order parameters q and  vanish continuously at the
Landau point.
17.2.4
Coupling to the Electric and Magnetic Fields
Let us examine here the response of a uniaxial nematic liquid crystal to a static
electric ﬁeld. We will restrict ourselves to nematics which behave as an ordinary
dielectric, that is, nematics such that the dipole moment of the sample is proportional
to the applied ﬁeld. In an isotropic liquid, the constant of proportionality, which is
the electric susceptibility at zero ﬁeld, is independent of direction. In a nematic it
depends on the direction of the applied ﬁeld. In other terms, the susceptibility has an
anisotropy. If the electric ﬁeld E is applied along the direction corresponding to the
axis of the rod-shaped molecules then the electric dipole moment per unit volume
P is
P D kE;
(17.25)
where k is the parallel susceptibility. If the ﬁeld is perpendicular then
P D ?E;
(17.26)
where ? is the perpendicular susceptibility. Denoting by n the unit vector parallel
to the direction of the axis of the rod-shaped molecules then both formulas above
can be written as
P D ?E C .n  E/n;
(17.27)
where the difference
 D k  ?
(17.28)
is a measure of the anisotropy, which can be positive or negative.
The electric contribution gele to the free energy per unit volume will be
gele D ?
2 E 2  
2 .n  E/2;
(17.29)

17.3
Smectics
325
which is obtained by integration of the relation P D @gele=@E. The ﬁrst term is
independent of orientation. The second term instead depends on the orientation of
nematic liquid crystal sample. If  > 0 then it favors a parallel alignment with the
applied ﬁeld. If  < 0, it favors an alignment perpendicular to the applied ﬁeld. In
any case, the electric ﬁeld becomes a method for the alignment of a nematic sample
in a given direction.
We may also consider the response to a magnetic ﬁeld B. Similarly the
magnetization of a sample subject to a magnetic ﬁeld is given by
M D m
?B C m.n  B/n;
(17.30)
where
m D m

(17.31)

2 B 2  m

.n  B/2;
(17.32)
which is obtained by integration of the relation M D @gmag=@B.
The order parameter of the nematic phase can be experimentally obtained by
means of experimental measurements of the anisotropic part  of the electric
susceptibility or the anisotropic part m of the magnetic susceptibility. Among
other forms of experimental measurement of the order parameter we mention the
measurement of birefringence,
n D nk  n?;
(17.33)
the difference between nk and n?, the index of refraction parallel and perpendicular
to the director, respectively.
17.3
Smectics
17.3.1
Order Parameter
In addition to the orientational order, smectic liquid crystals have positional order
along one direction. We imagine the smectic liquid crystals as succession of layers
inside which the molecules are in the nematic state described by the director n. The
direction perpendicular to the layers deﬁnes the axis z. If the director n is parallel to
the axis z, the liquid crystal is called smectic -A. If the director n form an angle with
the axis z, then the liquid crystal is called smectic -C.

326
17
Liquid Crystals
Next let us examine the phase transitions occurring in a smectic -A liquid crystal.
To this end we need to deﬁne the order parameter that describes this phase. Denoting
the local density of the liquid crystal by .z/, we see that .z/ is a periodic function
of z with a period equal to L, the distance between two successive layers. Taking
into account only the ﬁrst terms of the expansion of .z/ in Fourier series, we write
 D 0 C  cos.2
L z C '/;
(17.34)
where  gives the measure of change in density when one passes from one to the
next layer and, therefore, vanishes when the liquid crystal undergoes a transition to
the isotropic phase or to the nematic phase.
It is important to note that two states that differ only by a translation along the z
direction are described by the same value of  but different values of phase '. Thus,
a smectic -A state is described by the variables  and ' which can be combined to
deﬁne the complex variable
 D ei';
(17.35)
which determines the order parameter of the smetic -A phase. It vanishes both in the
isotropic and nematic phases. Equation (17.34) can therefore be written as
 D 0 C Ref ei2z=Lg:
(17.36)
17.3.2
Phase Transition
To describe the phase transitions in a liquid crystal that can be found in isotropic,
nematic and smectic -A, we adopt the following free energy
g D g0 C a2q2 C a3q3 C a4q4 C b22 C b44  c4q22;
(17.37)
where the coefﬁcients depend on the temperature and possibly on other thermody-
namic ﬁelds. We consider that the coefﬁcients a4, b4 are strictly positive and that
c2
4 < 4a4b4 to ensure the convexity of g with respect to the set of variables q and .
The possible thermodynamic phases correspond to the various types of absolute
minima of g, obtained when the coefﬁcients are varied. The isotropic phase occurs
when q D 0 and  D 0, the nematic phase, when q ¤ 0 and  D 0, and the
smectic -A phase, when q ¤ 0 and  ¤ 0. To exclude minima corresponding to
q D 0 and  ¤ 0, we assume b2 > 0.
Let us start by determining the transition between the nematic and isotropic
phases. In this case,  D 0 in both phases so that the free energy (17.37) is
reduced to

From the solutions of the equations that determine q and  for each phase, we

of (17.43) and (17.44) and using a numerical procedure to determine the lowest

Thermal Radiation

Electromagnetic Waves
18.1.1
Radiation
When we are outdoors on a sunny day we feel the effects of heat on our skin even
if the environment is at a low temperature. Likewise, when we are near the ﬁre, we
feel more heat on the surface of our body that is exposed to ﬁre than on the opposite
surface. These effects are caused by radiative heat transfer from the emitting source,
the sun or ﬁre, to your body. This radiative transfer is distinguished from other
forms of heat transfer because it does not require a material medium to propagate.
In material media heat transfer occurs by thermal conduction or convection. The
thermal conduction is carried out in the solids by vibration of the crystal lattice and
in electrical conductors also by free electrons. In liquids and gases it occurs mainly
by the collision between molecules. The heat transfer by convection is that occurring
by the macroscopic motion of matter.
The radiative transfer does not require the presence of a material medium and is
the main form of heat transfer when the bodies are separated. It occurs by means of
electromagnetic waves that carry energy and can be absorbed and emitted by matter.
The photons, that are the elementary particles resulting from the quantization of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld, are continually being emitted and absorbed by bodies
by means of several processes: transitions between electronic, vibrational and
rotational levels in atoms and molecules, ionization or combination of free electron
with ions, change of the kinetic energy of free electrons, excitations of the crystal
lattice in solids. These processes give rise to a continuous spectrum of emission,
or absorption, superimposed by spectral lines resulting from transitions between
discrete energy levels.
The radiative transfer is the mechanism by which two bodies, physically isolated
from each other, come into equilibrium. If they are at different temperatures, the
hotter emits more radiation than it absorbs and the colder absorbs more than it
emits. In thermal equilibrium, each of the bodies absorbs and emits equal amounts of

radiation. A bar of iron heated to redness cools when removed from the heat source
and reaches room temperature mainly by radiative energy loss to the environment.
The same occurs with a ﬁlament of an electric lamp, which is practically materially
isolated from the environment due to the vacuum inside the lamp, when one
interrupts the electric power supply.
Electromagnetic waves propagate in vacuum at the speed of light, c D 2:9979 
108 m/s. The monochromatic waves are characterized by the frequency , or
equivalently by the wavelength 
 since these two quantities are related by c D 
.
Electromagnetic waves have distinct names according to its wavelength. Visible
light corresponds to a very small range of wavelength between 0:38  106 and
0:76  106 m. Wavelengths above the visible up to 103 m correspond to the
infrared radiation. Above the infrared are radio waves. Below the visible down
to 109 m, correspond to the ultraviolet radiation. The X-rays have wavelengths
between 108 and 1012 m and the gamma rays, below 1010 m. Thermal radiation
comprises the ultraviolet and infrared radiation in addition to the visible light.
Electromagnetic waves carry not only energy but also momentum. There is a
close relationship between the momentum p of an electromagnetic wave and its
energy E ,
p D E
c ;
(18.1)
a relation due to Maxwell. The same relation is valid for the momentum p of a
photon and its energy E . Considering that waves have momentum it is natural
to imagine that they exert pressure on bodies. Consider a cubic cavity of edge
L and the total energy U of the electromagnetic radiation within the cavity. As
electromagnetic waves move in three independent spatial directions we can assume
that 1=3 of them move in a particular direction, say along the x direction, parallel
to one edge of the cubic cavity. The momentum transferred to one of the walls
perpendicular to the x direction during a time interval 2L=c is .1=3/2U=c. The
force on the wall is the ratio between these two quantities and thus equal to U=3L.
Therefore, the pressure p on the wall, which is the ratio between the force and the
area of the face of the cubic cavity, is p D .U=3L/=L2 D U=3V , where V D L3 is
the cavity volume, that is,
p D u
3;
(18.2)
which is the relation between the radiation pressure p and the energy per unit
volume u D U=V of the radiation, relation due to Maxwell.
18.1.2
Kirchoff Law
To characterize the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation of a body at a given
temperature, we measure the energy emitted in each one of the frequencies of
electromagnetic wave. More precisely we measure the energy per unit time and

18.1
Electromagnetic Waves
331
per unit area of the emitter  emitted by the emitter within the frequency range
between  and  C . The monochromatic emissive power , as a function of ,
is different from one substance to another. However, there is a hull that can be
considered as the emissive power common to all bodies and therefore independent
of the emitter substance, which we call universal spectrum or black body spectrum.
The idea of black body was introduced by Kirchoff who established the universality
of the radiation spectrum. According to Kirchoff, the power spectral density of a
black body is independent of the particular characteristics of the emitter, depending
only on the frequency of the radiation and the temperature.
Certain bodies can be seen approximately as black bodies as the sun or as the
tungsten ﬁlament of a lit electric bulb. The black body radiation can be obtained by a
cavity whose walls are at a certain temperature T . The emitted radiation is observed
through a small hole made in the cavity. Considering that the photons almost do not
interact, the thermal equilibrium of radiation contained in a cavity occurs through
the mechanism of emission and absorption of photons by the walls.
18.1.3
Stefan-Boltzmann Law
The radiative heat ﬂux emitted by a surface is characterized by emissive power
˚ deﬁned as the radiative energy emitted by a surface by unit time and per unit
area. It is convenient to deﬁne the emissive spectral power ./ with respect to a
frequency . This quantity is deﬁned such that the product ./ is the radiative
energy emitted by a surface per unit time and per unit area, by the radiation with
frequencies between  and  C . The two quantities are related by

(18.3)
For the analysis of radiation within a cavity, it is convenient to introduce the
spectral density of energy ./ deﬁned such that du D  is the energy per unit
volume of the radiation with frequencies between  and  C d. The density of
energy, that is, the energy per unit volume u of electromagnetic radiation is related
to  by means of

Since the radiation that emerges from the cavity through the hole has velocity c,
then the emissive powers and the energy densities are related by  D c=4 and
˚ D uc=4. The factor 1=4 must be introduced by the following reason. Consider a
point within the cavity situated near the cavity opening and deﬁne the direction z as
one that arises at this point and goes out of the cavity through the hole. Since the
radiation in the cavity is isotropic, then the fraction of the radiation passing through
the vicinity of that point and emerging through the hole should be proportional

The Kirchoff universal law of radiation states that the spectral emissive power of
a blackbody depends only on the temperature T and on the frequency . Therefore,
the power spectral density .T; / only depends on T and  and the energy density
u.T / depends only on T . As the radiation pressure p is related to u by p D u=3 then
the pressure radiation p.T / also depends only T . Stefan has shown experimentally
that the emissive power ˚ is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute
temperature,
˚ D T 4:

The constant of proportionality is called Stefan-Boltzmann constant and is

Relation (18.6), called Stefan-Boltzmann law, was demonstrated by Boltzmann

Thus, the density of energy and the pressure are also proportionalto the fourth power

18.1.4
Free Energy
Consider a cavity of volume V whose walls are at a temperature T . Thermody-
namically, radiation within the cavity is characterized by only two independent
thermodynamic quantities and not by three as in a system with one chemical
component. In this sense, we can say that the radiation contained in a cavity
is actually a thermodynamic system with zero component. We can compare the
radiation in a cavity with the saturated vapor of a one component system for which
the vapor pressure only depends on the temperature. Similarly to what happens with

18.1
Electromagnetic Waves
333
the liquid-vapor coexistence in which a volume variation does not cause change
in the pressure if the temperature is kept constant, so does with radiation. By varying
the volume of the cavity, a certain amount of radiation will be absorbed or emitted
by the walls but the pressure remains unchanged.
In the representation of energy, U.S; V / depends only on entropy S and
volume V . The differential form of energy is given by
dU D TdS  pdV:
(18.10)
The extensivity of the energy allows us to reduce the fundamental relation into the
form U.S; V / D V u.s/ where u D U=V is the energy density and s D S=V is
the entropy density and the system can be described simply by u.s/. The relation
T D du=ds is also valid. The Euler equation,
U D TS  pV;
(18.11)
implies u D T s  p.
Using the Helmholtz free energy representation F D U  TS we see that
F.T; V / depends only on T and V . In addition,
dF D SdT  pdV:
(18.12)
The extensivity allows us to write F.T; V / D Vf .T / where f D F=V is the free
energy density. Notice that f .T / depends only on the temperature. From the Euler
equation
F D pV;
(18.13)
and therefore p D f from which follows that the pressure depends only on
temperature. In addition, f D u  T s and s D df=dT and the entropy density
depends only on temperature.
We have seen that the radiation pressure is related with energy density by
p D u=3. Since f D p then f D u=3. Replacing this last result in f D uT s,
we obtain the result 4f D T s. Deriving both sides of this equation with respect
to temperature and taking into account that s D df=dT , we obtain the following
differential equation for the entropy
3s D T ds
dT :
(18.14)
Integrating this equation, we get the entropy as a function of temperature
s D AT 3;
(18.15)
result obtained assuming that the entropy vanishes at the absolute zero of
temperature.

Since s D df=dT and p D f then s D dp=dT . integrating this equation
we get the radiation pressure

(18.16)
where we assumed that the pressure vanishes at T D 0. The energy density is
u D 3p so that
u D 3

(18.17)
a result consistent with the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Comparing with (18.9), we see
that the constant A is related to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant by
A D 16
3c :
(18.18)
When we vary the volume of a cavity at a constant temperature the pressure
remains invariant. However, a certain amount of radiation will be absorbed or
emitted by the walls. Consequently, a certain amount of heat will be exchanged
with the cavity walls. To determine the amount of heat, we calculate the enthalpy
H D U C pV because the variation in enthalpy equals the heat exchanged at
constant pressure. Using relation p D U=3V , we get H D 4pV and therefore
the amount of heat exchanged Q is equal to Q D H D 4pV . The work done
W by the radiation in this process is equal to the decrease in the free energy because
the temperature remains invariant. Since F D pV , then W D F D pV .
The variation of energy is U D 3pV .

Wien Displacement Law
According to Kirchoff the spectral density of energy .; T / of a black body
depends only on the frequency  of the radiation and temperature. Wien showed
that the spectral density must satisfy the following scaling law
.; T / D 3F. 

(18.19)
known as Wien displacement law. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is a direct conse-
quence of this law. Indeed, integrating the spectral density of energy over all
frequencies, we get the total density of energy

But the integral does not depend on T and we may conclude that u.T / is

The spectral density of energy .; T / has a maximum at a certain value of  that
we denote by max. To get max, we derive .; T / with respect to  to obtain the

that

(18.24)
that is, raising the temperature of a black body the frequency value for which the
spectral density of energy is maximum moves to the region of high frequencies,
known as Wien displacement law.
18.2.2
Planck Radiation Law
The radiation in a cavity can be viewed as a collection of harmonic oscillators
vibrating with different frequencies. Each oscillator corresponds to a normal mode
of vibration of the electromagnetic waves. Considering a cubic cavity of volume
V D L3, the normal modes correspond to waves propagating parallel to the sides of
the cube. The wavelength 
 must be a divisor of the length L of the edge of the cube,
that is, 
 D L=n, where n is an integer. Since 
 and the frequency  are related by
 D c=
 it follows that the normal modes have frequencies n D nc=L. Next we
determine how many vibration modes exist or equivalently how many oscillators
exist with frequencies between  and  C . Considering just one direction, this
number equals 2.L=c/, where the factor 2 is due to the two independent modes
of propagation of the electromagnetic waves, which are transversal. Considering the
three directions this number becomes 8.L=c/32 D 8.V=c3/2.
The spectral density of energy .; T / is therefore

(18.27)
where b is another constant, related to A by A D 8b=c3. Writing 1=T as a function

oscillator at high temperature what justiﬁes the identiﬁcation of the constant k as the
Boltzmann constant. As is well known the average energy of a harmonic oscillator
is equal to kT only in the classical regime. This result ceases to be valid at low
temperatures and must be replaced by the result of Planck, given by (18.34) valid in
the quantum context.
The background cosmic radiation, discovered by Penzias and Wilson, occurs
at the microwave band and has a black body spectrum corresponding to the
temperature of 2.725 K, as can be seen in Fig. 18.1.

Extent of Reaction and Afﬁnity
19.1.1
Chemical Reactions
A chemical reaction is a process in which one or more substances, the reactants,
are transformed into another or other substances, the products. A ﬂame is a
striking manifestation of combustion, which consists of the intense combination
of a substance with oxygen. The reaction with oxygen can be mild such as rust,
spontaneously occurring in iron exposed to atmospheric air. The decomposition of
a chemical compound into chemical elements, as in the electrolysis of water, or
the formation of a chemical compound from its constituents, as in the synthesis
of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen, are examples of chemical reactions
performed in the laboratory. A vessel with several chemical species inside of which
chemical reactions take place, is a thermochemical system. Chemical reactions can
be endothermic when heat is absorbed by the thermochemical system, or exothermic
when heat is released.
Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations constituted by the
chemical formulas of the reactants and products and the respective stoichiometric
coefﬁcients. The formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen is represented by
the chemical equation
2H2 C O2 ! 2H2O;
(19.1)
which means that two moles of hydrogen react with one mole of oxygen to
produce two moles of water. A chemical equation shows the quantitative relations
between reactants and products but do not necessarily represent the molecular
process among the reactants or the reaction mechanism. At the molecular level
the process may include intermediate reactions and involve other chemical species.
The combustion of hydrogen, represented by (19.1) is actually composed by chain
reactions comprising other chemical species in addition to H2 and O2. Though
relevant to the development of the reaction, the quantities of other chemical species

remain invariant and are not represented in the chemical equation, that shows only
the species whose quantities change, decreasing for the reactants and increasing for
products.
The reversed reaction of that given by (19.1) corresponds to the decomposition
of water, represented by
2H2O ! 2H2 C O2;
(19.2)
which occurs by the process of electrolysis, when an electric current passes through
a dilute salt solution. Electrolysis, brieﬂy represented by chemical equation (19.2),
consists of several intermediate reactions including those which occur at the
cathode, which produces hydrogen, and at the anode, where oxygen is produced.
The occurrence of the equilibrium of a reaction requires that its reverse also
occurs as is the case, for example, of the formation of ammonia from nitrogen and
hydrogen and its reverse, the decomposition of ammonia, both represented by
N2 C 3H2 • 2NH3:
(19.3)
In this equation, conventionally, the chemical species on the left are called reactants
and those on the right are known as products. The competition between the reactions
leads the system to equilibrium. If the reaction rate to the right is greater than the rate
of reaction to the left, there is an increase of the products which causes an increase
in the rate of reaction to the left approaching it to the rate of reaction to the right.
Eventually, the rates become equal and the chemical equilibrium is established. In
equilibrium, the quantities of products and reactants remain invariant. Later we
will analyze in detail the conditions of thermochemical equilibrium and will see
that in this regime the concentrations are interrelated in a manner consistent with
the chemical reactions. We will also examine the behavior of the thermochemical
equilibrium with temperature and pressure.
19.1.2
Thermodynamic State
To understand how one deﬁnes the thermodynamic state of a thermochemical
system in equilibrium, we examine a speciﬁc example. A vessel contains a gas
mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen and ammonia, within which the chemical reaction
represented by equation (19.3) takes place. The state of thermodynamic equilibrium
in the representation of energy U is deﬁned by the entropy S, the volume V and the
number of moles N1 of nitrogen, N2 of hydrogen and N3 of ammonia. In differential
form the internal energy U is given by
dU D TdS  pdV C 	1dN1 C 	2dN2 C 	3dN3;
(19.4)
where the temperature T , the pressure p and the chemical potentials 	i of the three
species are given by

This description, however, is only suitable in the absence of reaction, in which case
N1, N2 and N3 may in fact be considered independent variables. In a closed system
and in the absence of reaction, they remain invariant. If the system is closed but there
are chemical reactions, they can vary. The variations, however, can not be arbitrary
but must be in accordance to the rules imposed by the chemical reaction. In any
event, it is possible to ﬁnd combinations of N1, N2 and N3 that, in a closed system,
can be invariant and therefore be considered independent. Since there is only one
reaction and three chemical species, we should ﬁnd two independent variables, as
shown below.
Equation (19.3) means that one mole of nitrogen reacts with three moles of
hydrogen to produce two moles of ammonia. If, due to chemical reaction, the
amount of nitrogen is decreased by one mole then the amount of hydrogen will
decrease by three moles which means that
X2 D N2  3N1
(19.6)
remains invariant under the chemical reaction. The amount of ammonia, in turn, will
increase by two moles and
X3 D N3 C 2N1
(19.7)
will also remain invariant. Next we use the two variables X2 and X3 to describe the
thermodynamic state in the place of N1, N2 and N3. However, they are not sufﬁcient
and must be supplemented by one more variable, which we choose to be  D N1,
called the extent of reaction. With this expedient, the relation between the number
of moles and the new variables becomes
N1 D ;
N2 D X2  3;
N3 D X3 C 2;
(19.8)
which replaced into the differential form of energy (19.4) gives

variables. This property however is not shared by the variable  that, in equilibrium,
has its value dictated by the chemical reaction. In other terms, it should be
understood as a dependent variable. The system should therefore be understood as
a system of two components and not three and the state is now deﬁned only by
the variables X2 and X3, in addition to S and V . This means that, in equilibrium,
U should be independent of  so that the derivative .@U=@/S;V;X2;X3 D A must
vanish, which leads us to the result

(19.12)
which is the condition for thermochemical equilibrium for the reaction represented
by (19.3). At equilibrium, the chemical potentials are not independent but are related
by (19.12) which is again the manifestation that, in equilibrium, the system in fact
should be considered a two-component system rather than three.
19.1.3
Single Reaction
Here we extend the results above for a generic reaction among q chemical species.
At the same time we highlight the role of two conjugate quantities, the extent of
reaction and afﬁnity, which are relevant for the description of the thermodynamics
of chemical reactions.
The deﬁnition of the extent of reaction for a generic reaction is done as follows.
Denote by Bi the chemical formula for each one of the q chemical species of a
reactive system and suppose the occurrence of the following reaction among them

the chemical species that do not participate in the reaction.
The extent of reaction  is deﬁned by  D N1=1 and the complementary

Let us suppose that the k-th reaction causes a change in Ni equal to Ni D ik.

Substituting the results (19.24) and (19.25) in (19.18), we obtain

The equilibrium condition (19.33) tells us that the chemical potentials 	i are not
independent. The number of independent chemical potential equals the number of
chemical species q minus the number of chemical reactions r, that is, c D q  r. A
system of r chemical reactions and q chemical species must therefore be understood
as a mixture of c D q  r components. The chemical reactions (19.23) or
equivalently the equations (19.33), which connect the chemical potentials, should
be linearly independent, which means that none can be obtained from a linear
combination of the others.
19.1.5
Closed System and Thermodynamics Potentials
A closed system allows the exchange of heat and work but not the exchange
of particles with the external environment. The only variations of the number of
moles Ni are those dictated by the chemical reactions. As the quantities Xi are not
affected by these variations, they remain constant. For a closed system the following

enthalpy H D U C pV and the Gibbs free energy G D H  TS. The differential
forms of these potentials differ from that related to the internal energy by the ﬁrst
two terms of (19.30) or (19.34). For closed systems with only one chemical reaction,
described by the extension reaction , the differential forms of the internal energy

Thermodynamic Coefﬁcients
19.2.1
Heat of Reaction
We examine the thermochemical processes in a closed system with only one chem-
ical reaction, described by the extent of reaction , for which the differential forms
(19.35), (19.36), (19.37) and (19.38) are valid. There are two basic thermodynamic
processes as to how heat is transferred to a closed system. In one, the volume is
kept constant, dV D 0. In this case there is no work done and heat introduced TdS
becomes equal to the change of internal energy, dU D TdS, because A D 0. In
the other case, the pressure p is kept constant. In this case, the system does work
equal to pdV and the heat introduced becomes equal to the change in enthalpy.
Indeed, taking into account that A D 0 and p is constant, then TdS D dU C pdV D
d.U C pV / D dH.
The characterization of a chemical reaction as to the heat developed is made by
means of a quantity known as heat of reaction, deﬁned as the ratio of heat exchanged
and variation in the extension reaction during a process at constant temperature. We
deﬁne two types of heat of reaction. One is the isochoric heat of reaction, where the
volume is kept constant in addition to the temperature and deﬁned by

(19.41)
The second equality is valid only when A D 0. Both heats of reaction are measured
in units of energy per mole. When the heat of reaction is negative, the system
releases heat to the environment and the reaction is exothermic. When the heat of
reaction is positive, the system absorbs heat from the environment and the reaction
is endothermic.
In a thermochemical process, in addition to the heat exchanged, work may be
developed. At constant temperature the work pdV performed by the system is equal
to the decrease in Helmholtz free energy F D U  TS because, taking into account
that A D 0 and that T is constant, pdV D dU C TdS D d.U  TS/ D dF .
At constant pressure, the determination of the work is reduced to determining the
increase in volume.
To characterize a chemical reaction with respect to changes in volume, we
introduce the volume of reaction deﬁned as the ratio between the volume change
at constant pressure and variation of the extent of reaction. There are two types of
volume of reaction depending on which quantity, in addition to pressure, is kept
constant: entropy or pressure. They are deﬁned by

Thermochemical Coefﬁcient
Here we examine the properties resulting from the thermochemical stability. We
consider a closed system within which a single chemical reaction takes place which
is described by the extension reaction . We analyze the variations of this quantity

19.2
Thermodynamic Coefﬁcients
349
as a result of changes in other thermodynamic variables such as temperature and
pressure. We remark that a positive change,  > 0, means a displacement of the
reaction to the right, that is, there is an increase of the products and a decrease of
the reactants. A negative variation,  < 0, means a shift of the reaction to the left,
that is, there is an increase of the reactants and a decrease of the products.
If a thermochemical system is moved from equilibrium by a disturbance in the
extension reaction, the thermodynamic stability requires that the afﬁnity resulting
from this changes restores the equilibrium. That is, if  > 0 then A < 0 and if
 < 0 then A > 0. In other terms, @A=@  0 and the quantity ˝, deﬁned by

(19.52)
and which we call thermochemical coefﬁcient, holds the property
˝  0;
(19.53)
which is the expression of the thermochemical stability.
We may equally rely on the convexity of the thermodynamic potentials to get the
stability properties of thermochemical systems. We assume that the energy U is a
convex function of all variables S, V and . As a result of Legendre transformations,
the other potentials are convex functions only of the set of extensive variable. The
Helmholtz free energy F is convex function of V and , the enthalpy H of S and ,
and the Gibbs free energy of  alone. The convexity of any one of these potentials
with respect to the extent of reaction leads to the result (19.53). For example, the
convexity of the Gibbs free energy means that locally we have @2G=@2  0. Taking
into account that the afﬁnity A D .@G=@/Tp then ˝ D @A=@  0.
Other thermochemical coefﬁcients are deﬁned by using other thermodynamic
potentials. For example, we deﬁne
˝V D 

(19.54)
which is equal to ˝V D @2F=@2. Since F is a convex function of  then ˝V  0.
19.2.4
Thermochemical Identities I
The most direct consequence of the stability conditions of a thermodynamic system
has to do with the way a given thermodynamic variable changes as a result of
changes in its conjugate. The introduction of heat, that is, of the entropy never leads
to lowering the temperature, which means that the thermal capacity is positive or
zero. A compression, that is, an increase in pressure never leads to an increase in
volume, which means that the compressibility is positive or zero. As noted above,

350
19
Thermochemistry
an increase of the extension reaction never leads to an increase in the afﬁnity, which
means that the thermochemical coefﬁcient is positive or zero.
There are however other indirect consequences of stability, involving more than
two thermodynamic quantities. The bodies that expand with increasing temperature,
get warmer in compression. Those which contracts with increasing temperature, get
cooler in a compression. This result can be shown by using the thermodynamic
identity
 @p

D .@V=@T /p
.@V=@p/T
D ˛
T
:
(19.55)
Since T  0 then @p=@T and ˛ have the same sign. Therefore, the bodies that
expand with increasing temperature at constant pressure (˛ > 0), get warmer
with increasing pressure (@p=@T > 0). The bodies that contracts with increasing
temperature at constant pressure (˛ < 0), get cooler with increasing pressure
(@p=@T < 0). Using the identity

(19.56)
we get the same rule for an adiabatic compression.
Next we present the extension of these results, due to De Donder, for situations
where  and A are involved. The variation of the extent of reaction as a result of a
variation in temperature at constant pressure is characterized by the derivative
 @

.@A=@/Tp

(19.57)
where we made use of a Maxwell relation. Therefore, from the deﬁnitions of Qp
and ˝, we reach the following result
 @
@T

pA
D Qp
T ˝ :
(19.58)
As the denominator is positive, since ˝  0, then @=@T and Qp have the same
sign. If the reaction is endothermic (Qp > 0) then an increase in the temperature at
constant pressure shifts the reaction to the right, toward the products (@=@T > 0).
If the reaction is exothermic (Qp < 0) then an increase in temperature at constant
pressure shifts the reaction to the left, toward reactants (@=@T < 0). In both cases,
the equilibrium is shifted in the direction where heat is absorbed, a rule established
by van ’t Hoff and by Le Chatelier. The same result can be achieved if the volume is
maintained constant in the place of pressure. To this end it sufﬁces to use the identity

the result

(19.61)
Since the denominator is positive then .@=@p/ and VT have opposite signs. In
reactions that are accompanied by a decrease in the volume at constant temperature
and pressure (VT < 0), an increase in pressure shifts the reaction to the right, toward
the products (@=@p > 0). Those that are accompanied by an increase in volume
at constant temperature and pressure (VT > 0), an increase in pressure shifts the
reaction to the left, toward the reactants (@=@p < 0). In both cases, the equilibrium
is shifted in the direction in which the volume decreases, a rule established by
Le Chatelier. The same result is obtained if one considers the variation in the extent
of reaction as a result of an adiabatic change in pressure.

(19.62)
Suppose that we could insert or remove heat from a thermochemical system while

Analogously one can imagine the change in volume in the situation where  is

an increase in the volume causes a decrease in pressure smaller than that which

extensive quantity X due to a variation in its conjugate x is greater than the variation
that would result in the absence of reaction, .@X=@x/A > .@X=@x/, which is the
statement of the Le Chatelier-Braun principle due to Ehrenfest.

Thermochemical Equilibrium

Spontaneous Processes
Imagine an isolated system consisting of a vessel within which there are several
chemical species. The species are inert and the system is in equilibrium in a given
state. At a certain moment they cease to be inert and begin to react. We can
imagine, for example, that the reactants are separated and that at a particular instant
the walls that separate them are removed. From that moment the system evolves
spontaneously to a new equilibrium state whose entropy is greater than that of the

initial state. The entropy change obeys the inequality S  0, which can therefore
be used as a criterion for occurrence of spontaneous reactions in isolated systems.
In systems that are not isolated, spontaneous processes may occur with decreas-
ing entropy. In these situations we must use other criteria. If the temperature T and
volume V are kept constant, the system evolves to a state in which the Helmholtz
free energy is smaller. The change in the Helmholtz free energy obeys the inequality
F D U  TS  0;
(19.69)
which is the criterion for the occurrence of spontaneous reactions systems main-
tained at T and V constant. If the temperature T and pressure p are constant, the
system evolves to a state in which the Gibbs free energy is smaller. The change in
the Gibbs free energy obeys the inequality
G D H  TS  0;
(19.70)
which is the criterion for the occurrence of spontaneous reactions in systems
maintained at T and p constant.
The exothermicity of a chemical reaction, characterized by H < 0, is not
sufﬁcient to ensure spontaneity in processes at T and p constant, unless S > 0 or
the temperature is sufﬁciently low. In this regime, according to the Nernst principle,
S becomes very small, and vanishes when T ! 0 so that H approaches G.
The criterion H < 0 was recognized by Berthelot and Thomsen, but it alone is
valid only at sufﬁciently low temperatures. Endothermic reactions, characterized by
H > 0, may indeed occur spontaneously at high temperatures, regime in which
the second portion can prevail over the ﬁrst
The obedience to the above criteria do not guarantee that the reaction will
actually occur because the criteria do not include information on reaction rates.
According to the Table 19.1, the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen is

19.3.2
Standard Enthalpy of Reaction
In the study of thermochemical processes it is essential to determine the variation of
thermodynamic potentials in cases in which the reactants and products are separated
in their pure states. More precisely, in the initial state there are only reactants,
which are separated in their pure states, at a certain temperature and pressure, and
whose quantities in moles are equal to the stoichiometric coefﬁcients of reaction.
In the ﬁnal stage there are only products, which are separated in their pure states,
at the same temperature and pressure of the reactants, and whose quantities in
moles are equal to the stoichiometric coefﬁcients of reaction. As the reactants
and products are separated, the initial thermodynamic potential is the sum of the
potential of the individual reactants and the ﬁnal potential is the sum of potential of
the products individually. Taking as reference the reaction (19.13), the variations of
thermodynamic potentials, u, f , h and g, are given by
u D

f D

(19.71)
h D

g D

igi;
(19.72)
and are called standard energy of reaction, standard Helmholtz free energy of
reaction, standard enthalpy of reaction and standard Gibbs free energy of reaction.
The quantities ui, fi, hi and gi are respectively the molar quantities of each of the
chemical species alone. Note that the four expressions above are in fact differences
between the thermodynamic potentials of the products and reactants of the reaction
(19.13) because, according to the convention used the stoichiometric coefﬁcients
are positive for products and negative for the reactants.
It is worth mentioning that the standard enthalpy of reaction as well as other
standard potentials have the additivity property. If we consider that a certain
chemical reaction, as the reaction (19.14), is equivalent to several intermediate
reactions, which we consider to be those given by equation (19.23), that is, such
that i D P

the standard enthalpies hj of the intermediate reactions

The standard entropy of reaction and the standard volume of reaction are given by

(19.75)
where si and vi are the molar entropy and the molar volume, respectively of the
chemical species alone. For ideal gases vi D v D RT=p is independent of the gas
and in this case v D v P
i i and the work done is pv D RT P
i i. Therefore,
if the sum of the stoichiometric coefﬁcients of the products is greater than those of
the reactants, the volume will increase and there will be work done. The standard
potentials of reaction are related by
h D u C pv;
(19.76)
f D u  Ts;
(19.77)
g D h  Ts:
(19.78)
Table 19.1 shows the values of h, s and g for some reactions. The values for
the reverse reactions are obtained by changing the signs of these values.
The standard enthalpy of reaction corresponding to the synthesis of one mole of
a substance from its constituents is called enthalpy of formation. By convention,
constituents are simple chemical substances stable at the pressure of 1 atm and
temperature of 25 ıC. The enthalpy of formation water is the standard enthalpy of
the reaction H2C(1/2)O2 ! H2O. Note that hydrogen and oxygen are gases at the
standard state while the water is liquid at the standard state. The heat of combustion
is deﬁned as the standard enthalpy of reaction of one mole of a substance with
oxygen having as products CO2 and H2O.

various chemical species are not independent but are related in accordance with

the activity of each chemical species deﬁned as follows. For each chemical species,
we introduce a reference chemical potential 	ı
i which depends only on T and p.
We deﬁne the relative activity of ai, or simply activity by

19.3.4
Guldberg-Waage Law
The equilibrium equation (19.83) is as general as the condition (19.79), being valid
for any system. To use any of these two conditions for speciﬁc cases, we must know
the dependence of the chemical potentials or activities with T , p and Ni. Next
we consider the case of dilute solutions and of ideal solutions, which include the
mixtures of ideal gases. For these systems the reference chemical potential can be
chosen such that the relative activity ai of a chemical species coincides with its mole
fraction xi, that is,
ai D xi;
(19.87)
or equivalently
	i D 	ı

(19.88)
The mole fractions are deﬁned by xi D Ni=N , where N

Recall that K depends only on temperature T and pressure p. Note that the
expression at left is actually a ratio because some stoichiometric coefﬁcients are
negative and others positive. For the reaction (19.3), 1 D 1, 2 D 3 and

equilibrium constant means an increase of the products at the expense of reactants:
the reaction shifts to the right or toward the products. A decrease in the constant
means a decrease of the products and an increase of the reactants: the reaction shifts
to the left or towards the reactants.
The chemical potential 	i of a component of an ideal gas mixture is given by
	i D gi C RT ln xi;
(19.90)
where gi is the molar Gibbs free energy of component i alone and is given by
gi D ˛i  RT ln RT
p :
(19.91)
The ﬁrst term ˛i only depends on temperature and is given by ˛i D biT 
ciT ln RT , where bi and ci are constants speciﬁc to each gas. We can therefore
identify gi with the reference chemical potential 	ı
i and write the equilibrium
constant (19.84) as

(19.92)
where  D P

sponding to a mixture of ideal gases varies with pressure according to

(19.94)
Notice that Kc depends only on temperature and therefore an increased in pressure
may increase the equilibrium constant as long as  < 0 which occurs when the sum
of the stoichiometric coefﬁcients of the products is less than that of the reactants. In
other words, when the reaction occurs with a decrease in number of molecules.
The equilibrium condition can be written in terms of concentrations, deﬁned by
i D Ni=V . Since xi D Ni=N then xi D iV=N D iRT=p. Replacing this
result in equation (19.89) and using (19.94) we arrive at the equilibrium equation in

Guldberg-Waage law of chemical equilibrium.
It is also possible to write the condition for equilibrium in terms of the partial
pressures. Using relation pi D iRT between the partial pressure pi of each gas

van ’t Hoff Equation
The behavior of the equilibrium constant with temperature can be obtained from
standard enthalpy through the van ’t Hoff equation, obtained as follows. From
equation (19.85),
R ln K D g

Taking the derivative with respect to temperature

@ ln K
@T

p
D h
RT 2 ;
(19.99)
which relates the isobaric variations of the equilibrium constant with temperature
and the standard enthalpy h. If the reaction is endothermic (h > 0) then an
increase in temperature at constant pressure shifts the reaction to the right, toward
the products (@K=@T > 0). If the reaction is exothermic (h < 0) then an increase
in temperature at constant pressure shifts the reaction to the left, toward the reactants
(@K=@T < 0). In both cases the equilibrium is displaced in the direction in which
heat is absorbed, a rule introduced originally by van ’t Hoff.
Similarly, we obtain the variations of the equilibrium constant with pressure, at
constant temperature. Deriving equation (19.85) with respect to pressure, and taking
into account that @g=@p D v we reach the result

In reactions that are accompanied by a decrease in the volume at constant tempera-
ture and pressure (v < 0), an increase in pressure shifts the reaction to the right,
towards the products (@K=@p > 0). Those that are accompanied by an increase
in volume at constant temperature and pressure (v > 0), an increase in pressure
shifts the reaction to the left, towards the reactants (@K=@p < 0). In both cases, the
equilibrium is shifted in the direction where the volume decreases.

Here we determine the Gibbs free energy of a ideal gas mixture enclosed in a closed
vessel at a given temperature and pressure, given by

(19.101)
where xi D Ni=N , N D P
i Ni and gi is the molar Gibbs free energy of the
i-th gas alone and depends only on of T and p. We consider a single chemical
reaction, represented by (19.14) and described by the extent of reaction . The
number of moles depends on  according to the equations (19.16) and (19.17). Here
we examine the situation in which at the minimum value of , which we consider
to be zero, the vessel contains only reactants, whose numbers of moles we denote
by N R

that is, N R

In addition the number of moles is equal to the stoichiometric coefﬁcient, that is,

Table 19.1 gives the value g D 16:4 kJ/mol for the reaction (19.107), at the
pressure of 1 atm and temperature of 25 ıC, from which we can calculate K by
means of (19.106) with the following result K D 747 which gives  D 0:968.
This value for the production of ammonia is large but the rate of reaction at room
temperature is very small. At high temperatures the rate increases and the process
becomes feasible as long as  is appreciable. At the pressure of 1 atm and the
temperature of 500 ıC we use the result of problem 19.2 to obtain the following
value for the equilibrium constant K D 0:0034 from which we get  D 0:0022,
which is very small. Increasing the pressure it is possible to increase . Indeed,
according to equation (19.94) the equilibrium constant is proportional to p. In the
present case  D 1 C 2 C 3 D  1 and thus K is proportional to the pressure p.
Therefore, for a pressure of 100 atm, and temperature of 500 ıC, K D 0:34 which
gives  D 0:16, a reasonable value. The use of high pressures ant high temperatures,
together with the use of a catalyst, comprises the Haber method for the production
of ammonia.

19.3.7
Consistency of the Equilibrium Constants
We have seen that a system consisting of various chemical reactions, represented
by (19.23), the equilibrium conditions must take into account each one of the
reactions. These conditions are given by equation (19.33), valid for each one of the
chemical equations. From them we get the equilibrium conditions for each equation
in terms of the activities, mole fractions, and concentrations. The forms of these
conditions are analogous to those valid for a single chemical equation. For example,
the equilibrium condition in terms of the activities with respect to the j-th chemical
equation is given by
a
j1
1 a
j 2
2
: : : a
jq
q
D Kj;
(19.112)
where Kj is the equilibrium constant associated to the j-th chemical equation.
A chemical reaction such as that represented by the chemical equation (19.14)
may be composed by a set of intermediate reactions. We assume that they form a set
of r reactions represented by the chemical equations (19.23). As the intermediate
reactions should result in the overall reaction then the stoichiometric coefﬁcients
are related by
i D
r
X
j D1
ji:
(19.113)
In the thermodynamic equilibrium, the chemical equilibrium equations must be
valid for the overall reaction and for each of the intermediate reactions.
The consistency of the equilibrium equations must be such that the equilibrium
equations of intermediate reactions should result in the equilibrium equation of the
overall reaction. In fact, using the result (19.113) we see that the equations (19.33),
which describe the thermochemical equilibrium of the intermediate reactions in
terms of chemical potentials, imply the equation (19.22), which represent the ther-
mochemical equilibrium of the overall reaction in terms of the chemical potentials.
The same consistency exists for the equilibrium equation in terms of activities,
and also in terms of mole fractions and concentrations. For each intermediate
reaction the condition (19.112) is valid. Multiplying the equations (19.112) for
j D 1; 2; : : : ; r and using the result (19.113), the product results in the equilibrium
equation (19.89) with K given by
K D K1K2 : : : Kr;
(19.114)
or equivalently by
ln K D ln K1 C ln K2 C : : : C ln Kr:
(19.115)
The validity of the Guldberg-Waage law for each intermediate reaction results
in the validity of the law for the overall reaction or any reaction that can be
considered as a combination of intermediate reactions. The equilibrium constants
of the intermediate reactions are related to the equilibrium constant of the overall
reaction by the equation (19.114) or equivalently (19.115).
