Preface
T
his book is about an insidious assault on our freedom and the fail-
ure of the law to respond to it. The assault comes from government
monitoring of our communications, actions, and transactions. The failure
results from the inability or unwillingness of courts and legislatures to
recognize how pervasive and routine this government surveillance has be-
come. To ensure that this powerful tool is not abused, this book argues
that something equally powerful—the Constitution, and in particular the
Fourth Amendment to the Constitution—must stand guard.
All of us are familiar with electronic surveillance—wiretapping, bug-
ging, and the like—because it has been with us for almost a century. This
book focuses instead on a signiﬁcant new development in the govern-
ment’s surveillance efforts: the use of sophisticated technology to observe
our daily activities (physical surveillance) and to peruse records of those
activities (transaction surveillance). Our wanderings, our work, and our
play can now be monitored not only through binoculars and other types of
telescopic lenses but also with night scopes, tracking mechanisms, satellite
cameras, and devices that detect heat and images through walls. Trans-
actional information, even that which is ﬁnancial and medical in nature,
is often readily accessible via snoopware, commercial data brokers, and
ordinary Internet searches. While some of these technologically enhanced
investigative techniques have been around for several decades, most have
been developed more recently, and law enforcement use of these tech-
niques(oldandnew)hasincreasedgeometricallyinthewakeofSeptember
11, 2001.
I pair physical surveillance and transaction surveillance by the govern-
ment for three reasons. First, as just noted, both rely heavily on technology.
Of course, physical surveillance can be carried out with the naked eye, and

transactional information can be obtained by poring through papers in a
ﬁle cabinet. But both types of surveillance today depend substantially on
high-tech instruments and complex computer programs, many of which
vastly enhance government’s capacity to spy on us.
Physical and transaction surveillance also belong together because both
can be conducted from afar. The classic law enforcement search requires
an entry of some sort, such as a detective barging into a house or police
ofﬁcers rummaging through the contents of a car. Physical and transaction
surveillance, in contrast, can occur from across the street, from across town,
or even from outer space; more commonly, once the proper technology is
in place, government agents can pursue both types of surveillance without
ever leaving their ofﬁces. Thus, the government can investigate a place or
an event without being there.
Of course, electronic surveillance, or what this book calls “communica-
tions surveillance,” also relies on technology and does not require physical
intrusion. There is, however, a third sense in which physical and transac-
tion surveillance are similar that distinguishes them from communications
surveillance. Wiretapping, bugging, and other forms of communications
surveillance are clearly regulated by the Constitution, more speciﬁcally the
Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.
In contrast, many types of physical and transaction surveillance are not
formally recognized as searches that implicate the Fourth Amendment.
As a result, much of this surveillance, although a search in effect, is not
seriously regulated by law.
This book is meant to prod legislatures and courts into more mean-
ingful constraints on physical and transaction surveillance. While these
types of surveillance may be different from both classic searches and from
communications surveillance in the senses described above, in their cur-
rent minimally regulated state they do real harm to individual interests
and ultimately to society and government itself. That state of affairs must
change.

Introduction:
Surveillance Techniques and the Law
T
he term “surveillance,” as used in this book, refers to government
efforts to gather information about people from a distance, usually
covertly and without entry into private spaces. Surveillance can be divided
into three types. Communications surveillance is the real-time intercep-
tion of communications. Physical surveillance is the real-time observation
of physical activities. Transaction surveillance involves accessing recorded
information about communications, activities, and other transactions.
Governments have long relied on all three types of spying. What is new
about today’s surveillance is the ease with which it can be conducted; over
the past several decades, technological advances have vastly expanded
the government’s monitoring ability. Wiretapping and bugging have been
joined by space-age eavesdropping and computer-hacking techniques that
make interception of oral and written communications inﬁnitely easier
than in J. Edgar Hoover’s day. Observation of physical activities, once
reliant on naked eye observation and simple devices like binoculars, can
now be carried out with night scopes and thermal imagers, sophisticated
telescopic and magniﬁcation devices, tracking tools and “see-through” de-
tection technology. Records of transactions with hospitals, banks, stores,
schools, and other institutions, until the 1980s usually found only in ﬁle cab-
inets, are now much more readily obtained with the advent of computers
and the Internet.
A second difference between the surveillance of yesteryear and to-
day is the strength of the government’s resolve to use it. Especially since
September 11, 2001, the United States government has been obsessed,
as perhaps it should be, with ferreting out national security threats, and

modern surveillance techniques—ranging from data mining to global po-
sitioning systems—have played a major role in this pursuit. But the new
surveillance has also increasingly been aimed at ordinary criminals, includ-
ing those who represent only a trivial threat to public safety. And more
than occasionally it has also visited signiﬁcant intrusion on large numbers
of law-abiding citizens—sometimes inadvertently, sometimes not.
Sophisticated surveillance technology and a powerful government ea-
ger to take advantage of it make a dangerous combination—a recipe
for continuous mass surveillance. While surveillance can be a valuable
law enforcement tool, it also poses a signiﬁcant threat to our legitimate
freedoms—to express what we believe, to do what we want to do, to be
the type of person we really are. In short, it can diminish our privacy and
autonomy.
Accordingly, I argue in this book, government use of communications,
physical, and transaction surveillance should be closely watched and sub-
ject to meaningful regulation. Furthermore, because surveillance can so
drastically alter the relationship between the government and its citizens,
the primary source of that regulation, at least in this country, should be con-
stitutional rather than legislative, to ensure that the applicable principles
are not subject to the whims of a majority panicked by events of the day.
While a number of provisions in the U.S. Constitution are plausible can-
didates for this role, the constitutional language that most directly speaks
to the concerns raised by surveillance is found in the Fourth Amendment,
which guarantees our right to be “secure” in our “persons, houses, pa-
pers and effects” from improper government searches and seizures. More
speciﬁcally, because all three types of surveillance involve looking for
something, they appear to trigger the Fourth Amendment’s protections
mandating that government “searches” be reasonable and that warrants
authorizing such searches be based on probable cause and describe with
particularity the place to be searched and items to be seized.
Unfortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court has never come close to constru-
ing the term “search” in the Fourth Amendment as broadly as a layperson
would. Rather, for various reasons, it has signiﬁcantly constricted the scope
of the Fourth Amendment. As a result, many types of communications,
physical, and transaction surveillance are not considered searches—that
is, they are not recognized as constitutionally relevant events. Of course,
federal and state legislatures can try to ﬁll this legal void. But as subse-
quent chapters make clear, legislatures too have ignored or only minimally
regulated most types of surveillance.

The one important exception to this judicial and legislative nonchalance
is the federal statute usually referred to as Title III, found in Chapter 18
of the United States Code,1 which is an outgrowth of Supreme Court de-
cisions holding that phone tapping and bugging do implicate the Fourth
Amendment. Congress’s original version of Title III, enacted in 1968, re-
quired that interceptions of phone communications be authorized by a
warrant based on probable cause. In 1986, Congress passed the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, which, among other things, extended this
warrant requirement to the interception of many types of communications
made via computer and other electronic technology.2
Other types of surveillance, however, are much less heavily regulated.
For instance, the Constitution, as construed by our courts, places no restric-
tions on surveillance meant to ascertain the parties to (rather than the con-
tent of) a communication, likewise imposes no constraints on transaction
surveillance of records held by third parties, and limits physical surveil-
lance only when conducted with sophisticated technology and aimed at
the home. While legislatures have been somewhat more willing to regu-
late these government investigative techniques, none have mandated the
type of warrant and probable cause requirements Title III imposes on
surveillance designed to intercept the content of communications.
This book focuses on physical and transaction surveillance, discussing
communications surveillance only for comparison purposes. Outside the
national security context,3 the key issues associated with communications
surveillance have been resolved in Title III and related case law. The same
cannot be said for physical and transaction surveillance. Even though their
effects are much more pervasive than communications surveillance and
can be just as invasive, these exercises of government power have been
relatively neglected, not just by courts and legislatures but by commenta-
tors as well. Both types of surveillance deserve much more attention.
The principal thesis of this book is that, given their insult to privacy, au-
tonomy, and anonymity, physical and transaction surveillance techniques
must be regulated more extensively than they currently are. This chapter
sets the stage for this argument. Sections 1 and 2 provide a more detailed
description of physical and transaction surveillance techniques. Section 3
offers an overview of the law governing use of these techniques. Section 4
describes the organization of the rest of the book.

I. Physical Surveillance Technology
It is the year 2008. The Chicago police know that a large and violent drug
ring is operating out of Slumville, a downtown section of the city. The gang
manufactures drugs, sells them on the streets, and distributes them to other
locationsinChicagoandoutlyingareas.Waryofelectronicsurveillance,the
group never uses phones or pagers but instead conducts all its transactions
face to face. The city is fed up with having an illegal drug factory in its
midst.
The new chief of police wants to mount an aggressive effort to close
down the gang’s operation, but she does not have the ofﬁcers she needs
to carry out an extensive campaign. Even if she did, she doubts whether
traditional foot and car patrols could safely put a stop to the gang’s ac-
tivities. The department has recently spent a considerable sum of money
on investigative technology. The chief decides that using the new gadgets
to identify and assemble evidence against the kingpins and soldiers of the
operation would be the perfect way to prove the worth of the investment.
The attack on the gang proceeds on several fronts. Telephone poles
at every intersection of Slumville are conspicuously outﬁtted with bullet-
resistant video cameras, equipped with wide-angle lenses, zoom and night
vision capabilities, and twenty-four-hour recording capacity. Miniature
video cameras with pinhole apertures are covertly installed in a number
of Slumville buildings thought to house gang members. At night, police
periodically ﬂy over the area in helicopters, armed with night scopes that
have a magniﬁcation power of 500 and thermal-imaging devices that detect
heat waves emanating from buildings that might indicate the presence of
a drug processing laboratory.
Any car that leaves or enters the area is tracked using the Global Posi-
tioning System (GPS) or, if the vehicle’s transponder has been disabled and
a beeper can be surreptitiously planted, through beeper signals. To the ex-
tent gang cell phone numbers are known, wireless telephones networks are
used to locate functioning cell phones and thus the location of their owners.
At various streets leading into Slumville, checkpoints are established. At
each one, the department installs devices that produce silhouettes of ob-
jects concealed by clothing or car exteriors. Similar handheld devices are
used by foot and car patrols to scan passersby. As a ﬁnal measure, the city
contracts with the federal government to have photographs of Slumville
taken whenever a satellite is within range; these pictures can be enhanced
to highlight suspicious activity.

All this technology exists today, albeit in differing stages of develop-
ment. Some of it (for example, video cameras) has been available to the
police in some form for decades. Other technologies (for instance, sensi-
tive “see-through” technology, GPS, and satellite photography) have only
recently begun to ﬁnd their way into the law enforcement arsenal, partly
as the result of the “peace dividend” associated with the end of the Cold
War. Although none of this technology is routinely used by the average
police department at present, its prevalence is increasing as it becomes less
expensive and better known. Cameras, night scopes, beepers, and thermal
imagers are staple investigative tools of many large departments and even
some smaller ones.
Following the lead of the American Bar Association’s Standards on
Technologically-Assisted Physical Surveillance,4 the various technologies
alluded to above can be divided into ﬁve categories: cameras, tracking
devices, telescopic devices, illumination devices, and detection devices (i.e.,
devices capable of detecting concealed items). These functional groupings
describe the spectrum of physical surveillance technologies that exist as
well as those that are likely to be developed in the foreseeable future.
Camera technology has been available for some time, but the past three
decades have seen dramatic advances in the ﬁeld. With the advent of wide-
angle and pinhole lenses, night vision equipment, and super-magniﬁcation
capability, video surveillance allows viewing of home interiors, workplaces,
and public thoroughfares at all times. Cameras can be placed in picture
frames, briefcases, pens, suit lapels, and teddy bears, permitting covert ob-
servation in virtually any circumstance.5 As chapter 4 describes in detail,
cameras also can be used overtly and conspicuously to observe private es-
tablishments and public places. Furthermore, any surveillance by camera
can be recorded—creating a permanent record of activities within the cam-
era’s range—as well as digitally transported to squad cars and anywhere
else a computer exists.
Tracking devices also come in many forms. The simplest and one of
the oldest is the beeper, which emits a signal that can be traced and can
be placed in virtually any moveable object, ranging from purses to cars.6
Other tracking devices under development or already in use include the
Global Positioning System, which uses satellites to determine the loca-
tion, within a dozen feet, of an item containing a GPS device;7 bistatic
sensor devices, which passively pick up various types of emissions (e.g.,
from a cellular phone or a light source) or utilize an active sonar-like capa-
bility;8 and radio frequency identiﬁcation technology that rely on signals

from chips embedded in credit cards and other objects such as passports
to identify people from up to 750 feet away.9 Intelligent Transportation
Systems (sometimes called Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems) involve
ﬁtting every vehicle in a given transportation network with a radio unit that
transmits to a base station. While used principally as a means of controlling
trafﬁc patterns, these systems can also provide a way of tracking vehicles’
current or previous locations.10
Unlike modern video surveillance and tracking systems, some types of
telescopic and illumination devices—binoculars and telescopes, ﬂashlights
and spotlights—have been available for well over a century. Today, how-
ever, new technology provides would-be viewers with signiﬁcantly greater
ability to overcome obstacles created by distance and darkness. For some
time now, compact night vision equipment using infrared technology has
enabled covert observation of virtually any nighttime activity,11 while map-
making and satellite cameras have been able to focus on objects only a
few feet across from thousands of feet above.12 Moreover, illumination
and telescopic capabilities can be combined in one instrument, as with the
well-known Star-Tron binoculars.13
Detection systems include a wide range of devices using x-ray, heat sens-
ing, holographic radar, and other technologies. Simple metal detectors are
being augmented with handheld devices that can discern the shape and
size of items underneath a person’s clothing or even behind walls; some
of these devices may also reveal anatomical details. One such tool, devel-
oped by Millitech Corporation, registers radiation emitted from the body
and objects concealed on it.14 Because these waves readily pass through
clothing, and because the body is a good emitter while dense, inanimate
objects tend to be bad emitters, inanimate objects show up as outlines
against the body. A device developed by Raytheon aims a low-intensity
electromagnetic pulse at the subject and measures the time decay of each
object radiated, which differs depending on the object.15 The device then
compares the time decay of each object with known “signatures” of items
like guns; no image is produced. A third example, from the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory, measures the ﬂuctuations in the earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld caused by ferromagnetic material, like the metal in a gun.16 Other
mechanisms have been developed for detecting hidden explosives and bi-
ological weapons17 and for discerning heat differentials from a building
(which might signal the use of klieg lights or furnaces connected with the
growth or manufacture of contraband).18
Each of these technologies provides law enforcement with a powerful

ofouractivities,insideandoutsidethehome.Buttheirreachdoesnotbegin
to approach the surveillance capability that is provided by the technology
designed to access records of our activities and transactions.
II. Transaction Surveillance Technology
Like physical surveillance, transaction surveillance comes in many forms.
This book will divide it into two general types: target driven and event
driven. Using these two categorizations, the following discussion ﬂeshes
out the speciﬁc ways transaction surveillance can assist law enforcement
in investigating street crime.
Target-Driven Transaction Surveillance
Assume that Jones, a federal agent, is suspicious of you for some vague
reason—perhaps you often pay for your airplane tickets with cash, or you
have been observed with accessories you shouldn’t be able to afford, or
you are a young Arab male who attends the local mosque on a daily basis.
Under these circumstances, Jones clearly does not have sufﬁcient suspicion
for an arrest. But Jones feels he would be neglecting his obligation as a
law enforcement ofﬁcial if he did not investigate you a bit further; to him,
you are a target. So how does he ﬁnd out more about you?
Jones could confront you directly, either on the street or through a grand
jury. But neither approach is likely to net him much information, and both
will tip you off that he’s checking you out. Ditto with respect to going to
your acquaintances and neighbors; they are not always forthcoming and
they might let you know Jones has been nosing around. Jones could try the
undercover agent approach—there might be rich payoffs if he or one of his
informants can weasel their way into your good graces. But success at that
endeavor is rare, and expending so much effort on someone who is merely
suspicious would likely be a waste of time. Jones could surreptitiously
follow you around for a while, using physical surveillance technology or
good old-fashioned tailing techniques, but that tactic might not produce
much if you make most of your contacts through technological means—
phones and e-mail—rather than physical travel. Of course, Jones could tap
your phone and intercept your e-mail, but that requires a warrant based
on probable cause, which he does not have.

Thankfully for Jones, there are much more efﬁcient ways he can covertly
acquire information about you, many of which he can carry out without
leaving his desk and most of which, as later parts of this book describe,
require little or no legal authorization. The easiest way to get useful data
is to contact one of the many companies, usually called commercial data
brokers, that use computers and the Internet to dig up “dirt” from pub-
lic and not-so-public records.19 One such company is SeisInt, a concern
owned by LexisNexis that operates a program known as Accurint (for
accurate intelligence). According to its advertising, Accurint can, in mere
seconds, “search[ ] more than 20 billion records . . . dating back 30 years
and more,” armed with no more than a name, address, phone number,
or social security number.20 Through this process, the company says, it can
obtain information about a wide array of transactions, including bankrupt-
cies and corporate ﬁlings; criminal conviction and criminal and civil court
data (including marriage and divorce information); driver’s license and
motor vehicle records; ﬁrearms, hunting, ﬁshing, and professional licenses
and permits; Internet domain names; property deeds and assessments;
and voter registration.21 For some states, the information held in “public
records” by government bureaucracies and available via computer is im-
mensely broader: medical records, social security numbers, victims’ names,
credit card and account numbers, psychiatric evaluation reports, jurors’
names, tax returns, payroll information, and family proﬁles.22 For a time,
allofthiswasmadeevenmoreeasilyaccessibletostatelawenforcementof-
ﬁcials with the establishment of MATRIX (the Multi-State Anti-Terrorist
Information Exchange), a consortium funded in part by the federal gov-
ernment that allowed police to use Accurint for investigative purposes;23
today, however, the scope of MATRIX is much reduced.
The FBI and other federal agencies rely on commercial data brokers
that operate programs at least as powerful as MATRIX. ChoicePoint is
perhaps the best known of these companies.24 Under its contract with the
federal government, ChoicePoint can provide Jones, as a federal agent,
with“creditheaders”(informationatthetopofacreditreportthatincludes
name, address, previous address, phone number, social security number,
and employer); pre-employment screening information (including ﬁnan-
cial reports, a felony check, and veriﬁcation of education records, em-
ployment references, motor vehicle records, and professional credentials);
asset location services; information about neighbors and family members;
licenses (driver’s, pilot’s, and professional); business information compiled
by state bureaucracies; and bookings and arrests, liens, judgments, and

bankruptcies.25 If you think Jones wouldn’t bother running such a check,
think again; even in the years before 9/11, ChoicePoint and similar services
ran between 14,000 and 40,000 searches per month for the United States
Marshals Service alone.26
The drawback to the type of information Jones can get from commercial
data brokers is that it is pretty general. He may want to know more about
what you do on a daily basis. Fortunately for him, there are a number of
services that can help him out. For instance, advances in data warehousing
and data exchange technology in the ﬁnancial sector allow very easy access
to a virtual cornucopia of transaction-related information that can reveal,
among other things, “what products or services you buy; what charities,
political causes, or religious organizations you contribute to; . . . where,
with whom, and when you travel; how you spend your leisure time; . . .
whether you have unusual or dangerous hobbies; and even whether you
participate in certain felonious activities.”27 If Jones jumps through some
pro forma legal hoops (detailed later in this book), he can also obtain
from your phone company records of all the phone numbers you dial and
receive calls from, and from your Internet service provider (ISP) every
Web site address you have visited (so-called clickstream data) and every
e-mail address you have contacted.28
The latter information can be particularly revealing to the extent you
transact your business over the Internet. Some ISPs, like America Online,
have stopped maintaining clickstream data, precisely so it won’t have to
answer such law enforcement requests.29 No worries. All Jones has to do
is invest in something called snoopware. Bearing names like BackOriﬁce,
Spyagent, and WinWhatWhere,30 snoopware is to be distinguished from
adware and spyware. The latter software tells the buyer of the program
how to contact people who visit the buyer’s Web site. Snoopware, in con-
trast, allows its buyer to track the target well beyond a single website; it
accumulates the addresses of all the Internet locations the target visits,
as well as the recipients of the target’s e-mails. The FBI developed a sim-
ilar program—once dubbed Carnivore, then called DCS-1000, and now
discarded in favor of privately developed programs—that ﬁltered all e-
mails that pass through a particular server.31 Although some transaction
snoopware requires access to the server or computer to install, other types,
called Trojan Horses, can electronically worm their way onto the system
disguised as something useful.32
In short, even if you conduct all your business and social affairs at
home via phone calls, e-mail, and Web browsing, Jones can easily con-

struct what Anthony Miller has called “a complete mosaic” of your char-
acteristics.33 And he can do all this without your having a clue he’s doing
it. Jones could also surreptitiously obtain an even wider array of trans-
actional information—on matters ranging from medical treatment to ﬁ-
nancial decisions—with very little effort, especially if he can link his in-
vestigation with national security interests. But further discussion of that
possibility, as well as of the huge amount of transactional information that
the federal government can obtain if it is willing to proceed overtly, will
have to await explanation of the current legal regime in chapter 7.
Event-Driven Transaction Surveillance
Now consider an entirely different type of scenario, one in which the gov-
ernment has no suspicion of or even interest in a speciﬁc individual, but
rather possesses information about a particular crime that has been or
will be committed. Government efforts to obtain transactional data in this
situation is not target driven but event driven. Say, for instance, that the
police know that a sniper-killer wears a particular type of shoe (thanks to
mudprints near a sniper site), that he owns a particular type of sweater (be-
cause of threads found at another site), and that he reads Elmore Leonard
novels (because of allusions to those books made in his communications
to the police). Law enforcement understandably might want to peruse the
purchase records of local shoe, clothing, and book stores as part of their
investigation. Once police obtain the credit card numbers of those who
bought, say, the type of sweater found at the murder scene, they can trace
other purchases made with the same card, to see if the relevant type of
shoe or book was bought by any of the same people. Of course, if there is
a match on one or more of the three items, the surveillance may then turn
into a target-driven investigation.
Or suppose that a CIA informant reports that he believes Al Qaeda
is considering blowing up a major shopping mall, using skydivers jump-
ing from rental planes.34 The FBI might want to requisition the records
of all companies near major metropolitan areas that teach ski-diving and
that rent airplanes, as well as the “cookie” logs (records of cyberspace
visitors) of all websites that provide information about manufacturing ex-
plosives, to see if there are any intersections between these three cate-
gories of data, in particular involving men with Arab-sounding names. If
therearethen,again,furthertarget-drivensurveillanceinvestigationmight
take place.

Although the ﬁrst type of event-driven surveillance is backward look-
ing and the second is forward looking, both law enforcement efforts are a
form of “data mining” or “proﬁling,” that is, an attempt to look through
transaction information to ﬁnd patterns of behavior that permit police to
zero in on possible suspects.35 If the information sought is not digitized—
which is likely with respect to records kept by skydiving companies, for
instance—then law enforcement may have to rely on good old-fashioned
human snooping. In this day and age, however, a signiﬁcant amount of
data mining can be carried out using technology. For example, the Defense
Department’s Total Information Awareness program, before being scaled
back by Congress, was able to use software developed by private compa-
nies “to sift through virtual mountains of data of everyday transactions,
such as credit card purchases, e-mail and travel itineraries, in an attempt
to discover patterns predictive of terrorist activity.”36 Whether it relies on
computers or humans, event-driven data mining, like transaction surveil-
lance of particular individuals, can easily be conducted unbeknownst to
those whose records are surveilled.
III. Surveillance and the Constitution
Technology has made both physical surveillance and transaction surveil-
lance extremely potent law enforcement tools. The information about peo-
ple’s whereabouts, activities, and transactions that can be gleaned from
physical and transaction surveillance may often vastly exceed the evidence
produced by eavesdropping on or hacking into a person’s communications.
But as far as the government is concerned, the real beauty of most physical
surveillance and virtually all transaction surveillance is that, compared to
communications surveillance, legal regulation is minimal. Later chapters
in this book will describe in detail the relevant law, both constitutional and
statutory. Here only a sketch of constitutional jurisprudence governing
these virtual searches will be provided.
Constitutional analysis of government surveillance has to begin with
Katz v. United States,37 the most important judicial decision on the scope
of the Fourth Amendment. Charlie Katz was indicted for “transmitting wa-
gering information by telephone,” based on conversations federal agents
overheard using a bugging device attached to the phone booth where
he made the calls. Katz moved to suppress the conversations because
the agents had not obtained a warrant authorizing the bug. Before the

Supreme Court, the government proffered two reasons why the Fourth
Amendment’s warrant and probable cause requirements did not apply to
the electronic eavesdropping in Katz’s case. First, the Fourth Amendment
prohibits only unreasonable searches of “houses, persons, papers and ef-
fects,” and a phone booth does not ﬁt into any of these categories. Second,
relying on Supreme Court precedent that had for some time linked the def-
inition of “search” to trespass doctrine in property law,38 the government
argued that a Fourth Amendment search occurs only when the govern-
ment physically penetrates a protected area, which was not the case in
Katz because the bugging device was attached to the outside of the booth.
The Katz majority acknowledged the language of the Fourth Amend-
ment and the fact that earlier cases had tied the Fourth Amendment to
property concepts. But it ultimately ignored both semantics and precedent.
In an opinion by Justice Potter Stewart, the Court reasoned that the Fourth
Amendment “protects people, not places,” and that “what [a person] seeks
to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be con-
stitutionally protected.”39 A person “who occupies [a phone booth], shuts
the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is
surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will
not be broadcast to the world.”40
Thus, Katz is said to have rejected a formalistic, property-based deﬁni-
tion of the Fourth Amendment, replacing it with a focus on privacy. The
focus on privacy was even more apparent in the formulation of the Fourth
Amendment’s threshold offered by Justice John Harlan in his concurring
opinion in Katz. There he stated that those seeking Fourth Amendment
protection should have to demonstrate only two propositions: “ﬁrst that a
person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and,
second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as
‘reasonable.’ ”41 This language, the second part of which has since become
the accepted deﬁnition of the Fourth Amendment’s threshold, was clearly
meant to confer Fourth Amendment protection on Charlie Katz.
On the other hand, Justice Harlan wrote, “conversations in the open
would not be protected against being overheard, for the expectation of
privacy under the circumstances would be unreasonable.”42 The majority
opinion made a similar observation when it stated that “[w]hat a person
knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or ofﬁce, is not a
subject of Fourth Amendment protection.”43 This language made clear that
the expectation-of-privacy concept was malleable, something subsequent
cases would demonstrate beyond cavil.

Even so, Katz appeared to expand the scope of the Fourth Amend-
ment. Certainly, the Court that decided it—the so-called Warren Court,
named after Chief Justice Earl Warren—thought so. Thus, for instance, in
Berger v. New York,44 decided the same year as (although a term before)
Katz, the Warren Court struck down New York’s eavesdropping statute
because it failed to require probable cause that a particular offense has
been or is being committed, and also failed to require that the conversa-
tions sought to be intercepted be particularly described in the warrant. In
doing so, the Court never paused to differentiate between surveillance that
involved a physical penetration of premises and surveillance that did not;
in either case, the Court made clear, electronic eavesdropping works an
infringement of privacy.45 It was against the backdrop of Katz and Berger
that Congress passed Title III, requiring that all nonemergency electronic
surveillance, federal and state, be authorized by a warrant meeting Berger’s
requirements, and additionally providing that such warrants be issued only
when there is cause to believe that “normal investigative procedures have
been tried and failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried
or to be too dangerous.”46
The year following the Katz and Berger decisions, the Warren Court
handed down Mancusi v. DeForte,47 which held that a union ofﬁcial should
be able to expect privacy in his ofﬁce even when he shares it with oth-
ers. Justice Harlan wrote for the Court that, despite the multiple users of
the space, “DeForte still could reasonably have expected that only those
persons and their personal or business guests would enter the ofﬁce, and
that records would not be touched except with their permission or that
of union higher-ups.”48 One year later, the Court concluded in Alder-
man v. United States that a person whose phone is tapped has standing
to contest the tap even if he is not a party to the conversation, because
when such surveillance occurs “ofﬁcialdom invades an area in which the
homeowner has the right to expect privacy for himself, his family, and his
invitees.”49
Within a few years of these decisions, the membership of the Court

of the new justices joined, the Court indicated that in a whole host of
situations, the expectation-of-privacy rubric does not necessarily provide
any more protection than a property-based approach, and perhaps affords
even less protection. For instance, the Court held that the Fourth Amend-
ment is not implicated when police rummage through one’s garbage,50
inspect packages at an international border,51 or trespass on “open ﬁelds”
(that is, privately owned land beyond the “curtilage,” or area immediately
surrounding one’s home).52 In each of these cases, the Court concluded
that even if the target had a subjective expectation of privacy in the area
involved, any such expectation was unreasonable.
All these cases involved traditional searches. The Court’s decisions di-
rectly addressing application of the Fourth Amendment to physical and
transaction surveillance have been similarly restrained. That conclusion
might seem to be contradicted by the most prominent recent Supreme
Court case concerning surveillance, Kyllo v. United States,53 decided in
2001. Kyllo did prohibit use of a thermal imager to detect heat differ-
entials inside a home unless authorized by a warrant based on probable
cause. But Kyllo also indicated that if the domestic spying relies on technol-
ogy that is in “general public use,” it may occur without any justiﬁcation
at all. As discussed in chapter 3, that aspect of Kyllo potentially opens
a huge hole in the holding. In other decisions, the Court has concluded
that Fourth Amendment protection also disappears whenever the physical
surveillance monitors activities outside the home, regardless of the type of
technology used. Thus, according to the Court, police may use beepers to
track public travels,54 planes to ﬂy over backyards,55 map-making cameras
to survey business curtilage from the air,56 dogs to sniff luggage,57 and
ﬂashlights to look inside cars and barns,58 all without worrying about the
Fourth Amendment.
The same niggardly approach to Fourth Amendment protection is re-
ﬂected in cases involving transaction surveillance. The most important case
here is United States v. Miller,59 decided in 1976 after Justices Warren, For-
tas, Douglas, and Harlan had left the Court. In Miller, the Court, with
Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissenting, concluded
that we have no reasonable expectation of privacy in information we sur-
render to our banks. Three years later, in Smith v. Maryland,60 the Court
similarly held, 6–3, that the Fourth Amendment is not implicated when
the government seeks our phone records from the phone company. Read
broadly, these decisions suggest that transaction surveillance is also im-
mune from the restrictions of the Fourth Amendment.

IV. A Preview of the Book
This book criticizes all the post–Warren Court holdings described above, as
well as the assumptions about privacy and the reach of government power
that underlie them. The Court’s willingness to declare that persons cannot
reasonably expect their interactions with businesses and banks, their daily
wanderings, and even some of their conduct at home to be free from suspi-
cionless, warrantless surveillance by the government is contrary to societal
mores and other legal norms. This book also criticizes the courts’ failure
to regulate other aspects of surveillance, ranging from maintenance and
destruction of surveillance records to when and how notice of the surveil-
lance should be communicated to its targets. Finally, it takes Congress and
state legislatures to task for failing to rectify the Court’s deﬁcient case
law and makes concrete proposals about what both courts and legislatures
should be doing instead.
Chapter 2, the second chapter in this introductory section of the book,
sets out an interpretation of Fourth Amendment doctrine that provides
the springboard for these various criticisms and proposals. Most funda-
mentally, this chapter argues that when contemplating surveillance (or any
other investigative technique), government should be required to provide
justiﬁcation proportionate to the intrusiveness of the surveillance and to
seek third-party authorization in all nonexigent circumstances. These two
basic precepts—what I call the proportionality and exigency principles—
are consistent with the Court’s general approach to search and seizure
jurisprudence. In particular, they derive from the “balancing” analysis (i.e.,
weighing of government and individual interests) endorsed by the Court
in the late 1960s and applied with a vengeance by the post–Warren Court.
However, the similarities between my framework and the Court’s are only
skin deep. While I do not quarrel with balancing analysis per se, the re-
maining chapters demonstrate that the post–Warren Court’s application
of that analysis has attributed far too much weight to the government’s
interests and far too little to the individual’s.
Part 2 of the book consists of three chapters, all concerning physical
surveillance. Chapter 3 examines physical surveillance of the home. It ar-
gues that the Supreme Court’s decision in Kyllo, which many hailed as
a victory for privacy rights in our dwelling places, may not be as pro-
tective as it ﬁrst appears. Kyllo not only announced the “general public
use” exception but also declared that use of technology to view conditions
that a naked eye observer could see from a public vantage point is not a

search, even when the location viewed is the interior of the home. This
chapter shows that both the general public use and the “naked eye” ex-
ceptions are inscrutable, conceptually incoherent, and normatively objec-
tionable. It then argues that technological surveillance of the home should
be regulated either through a proportionality approach, which varies the
level of cause with the search’s intrusiveness, or through a legislative ap-
proach, using Title III’s regulation of communications surveillance as the
model.
Chapters 4 and 5 take on physical surveillance outside the home. The
primary thesis of these two chapters is that the advent of sophisticated
technology that allows the government to watch, zoom in on, track, and
record the activities of anyone, anywhere in public, twenty-four hours a
day, demands regulation. A second thesis is that if the legislative and ex-
ecutive branches are unwilling to undertake that regulation, courts should
step in, using the Fourth Amendment.
Chapter 4 builds the case for regulation, relying on philosophical and
constitutional principles as well as on the results of an original empirical
study investigating the reactions of ordinary citizens to public surveillance.
Chapter 5 imagines what that regulation would look like. It builds on the
Supreme Court’s roadblock jurisprudence and the proportionality princi-
ple in deﬁning when surveillance is permissible, and then addresses issues
connected with implementing a public surveillance regime. On the latter
score, it contends that politically accountable ofﬁcials should decide where
toplacethecameras(anapplicationoftheexigencyprinciple),thatgovern-
ment should provide notice of the surveillance and regulate the disclosure
and maintenance of surveillance records, and that enforcement of these
rules requires both direct sanctions on violators and periodic dissemina-
tion of information about surveillance practices. Finally, the chapter brieﬂy
explores the role of the courts in bringing all of this to fruition. It suggests
that courts set minimum guidelines and monitor police decisions to assure
that public surveillance is conducted in a reasonable manner, but that most
of the details be left up to the political process.
Part 3 of the book, discussing transaction surveillance, consists of two
chapters. Chapter 6 analyzes the constitutional legitimacy of subpoenas,
a subject that is crucial to understanding how transaction surveillance is
currently regulated. Whether issued by a grand jury or an administrative
agency, subpoenas are extremely easy to enforce, requiring only a demon-
stration that the items sought are “relevant” to an investigation. Yet today
subpoenas and pseudo-subpoenas are routinely used to obtain not only

business and other organizational records but also documents containing
signiﬁcant amounts of personal information about individuals, including
medical, ﬁnancial, and e-mail data. Chapter 6 explains why this regime is
a historical accident, and why it is repugnant as a matter of policy.
Chapter 7 describes in more detail the current legal regulation of trans-
action surveillance, and then suggests how it can be improved. In contrast
tophysicalsurveillance,transactionsurveillancehasbeenthesubjectofsig-
niﬁcant legislative activity. However, this law is only minimally restrictive,
and it is also confusing and contradictory; beyond the traditional subpoena,
challengeable by the target of the investigation, current law recognizes a
number of subpoena mutations that seem to have little rhyme or reason.
The proposed reform recognizes, as does the current regime, that different
sorts of records merit different (proportionate) levels of protection. But in
contrast to current law, and bolstered by another empirical study of soci-
etal attitudes, I urge legislatures (or courts if legislatures fail to act) to in-
crease the showing required to probable cause for private records obtained
through target-driven surveillance and to reasonable suspicion for private
records obtained through event-driven surveillance. I also recognize a cat-
egory of quasi-private records that can be obtained only on reasonable
suspicion if sought through target-driven surveillance. The relevance stan-
dard, which is the most demanding test that transaction surveillance must
meet under current law, would be reserved for investigations seeking truly
public records, records detailing the activities of businesses and other or-
ganizations, and data mining that does not access private records.
Chapter 8 summarizes the arguments made throughout the book and
then explores a central implication of its proposals—that the traditional
Fourth Amendment model requiring probable cause for all searches and
backed by the exclusion remedy serves neither societal nor individual in-
terests. Much relatively nonintrusive physical and transaction surveillance
cannot be justiﬁed at the probable cause level and should not have to be;
rather than recognizing this fact and adjusting Fourth Amendment law
accordingly (through a proportionality approach), the Court has insisted
that searches be based on individualized probable cause, which has cre-
ated an incentive to forgo constitutional constraints on investigative tech-
niques aimed at individuals and to defer to the government with respect to
surveillance of groups. Nor is the suppression remedy always an effective
deterrent in the surveillance context; at best it beneﬁts an inﬁnitesimally
small number of people subjected to illegal surveillance, and in any event
it is a poor remedial ﬁt with the types of violations that public surveillance

and much transaction surveillance are likely to involve. The dissonance
between these types of investigative techniques and the individualized
suspicion/exclusionary rule model suggests a need for rethinking both the
type of justiﬁcation and the type of accountability that the Fourth Amend-
ment should require.

A Fourth Amendment Framework
T
his chapter lays the groundwork for a reconceptualization of the
Fourth Amendment, a reconceptualization that drives both this
book’s critique of current law and its proposals for reform. While there
are a number of nuances to this new way of looking at the Fourth Amend-
ment, its key component can be stated very simply: a search or seizure is
reasonable if the strength of its justiﬁcation is roughly proportionate to
the level of intrusion associated with the police action. I call this concept
the proportionality principle.
As this book will demonstrate, the proportionality principle produces
rules that are sometimes dramatically different from current law. But the
principle is not without precedent in the Supreme Court’s own case law.
Almost forty years ago, in Terry v. Ohio,1 the Supreme Court established a
framework for analyzing the scope of Fourth Amendment protection that
should still inform our analysis today. As the Court in Terry put it, “[T]here
is ‘no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing
the need to search (or seize) against the invasion which the search (or
seizure) entails.’ ”2 This book’s approach to the Fourth Amendment and
its application of the Fourth Amendment to surveillance are to a large
extent an elaboration of this principle.
In Terry itself, the proportionality principle led to the holding that a
stop and frisk need be justiﬁed only on reasonable suspicion rather than
on the higher standard of probable cause required for more invasive ar-
rests and full searches.3 A number of subsequent cases purported to apply
the principle to a wide array of other searches and seizures. If these cases
had applied Terry’s proportionality framework in a consistent fashion and
extended it to the entire Fourth Amendment universe, constitutional reg-
ulation of searches and seizures would be in much better shape than it is

today. In particular, if the promise of Terry had been realized by the Court,
the rules regulating physical and transaction surveillance would be more
coherent and provide more protection of individual privacy.
Unfortunately, instead of treating Terry’s balancing formula as a seri-
ous principle that requires some hard thinking, the Court has used it as a
smoke screen for an ad hoc agenda. Instead of applying the proportion-
ality principle to all Fourth Amendment analysis, it has applied it only in
connection with seizures and a few other isolated scenarios. Accordingly,
Fourth Amendment law is a “mess,” to use the elegant phrasing of Akhil
Amar.4 It is a mess not just descriptively, in the sense that police and courts
have a hard time mastering it, but normatively, in the sense that it does not
reﬂect society’s core values.
As a predicate for explaining why current law about virtual searches is
deﬁcientandhowitshouldbechanged,thischaptermakesthecaseforreju-
venating and restructuring Terry’s proportionality principle. The principle
needs rejuvenation because its rationale—that the level of intrusiveness
should drive the level of justiﬁcation—seems to have been ignored even
in cases purportedly applying Terry. It needs to be restructured because
subsequent cases have been frustratingly vague about the government and
individual interests involved. In the spirit of rejuvenation, section 1 lays
out the positive case for the proportionality principle, in more detail than
Terry and its progeny have done. As a beginning to the restructuring pro-
cess, section 2 looks more closely at the two sides of the Terry balancing
formula—invasiveness and justiﬁcation—and ﬂeshes out what assessment
of them should entail. It also introduces what I call the exigency principle
(essentially a requirement for ex ante review in nonemergency situations)
and explains how it would work in conjunction with the proportionality
principle.
Section 2 also defends this proposed regime against various attacks
that have been leveled at Terry. From the left, these attacks include the
argument that Terry’s balancing formula is a dangerous threat to individual
freedoms because it undermines the probable cause standard and allows a
pragmatic assessment of interests that inevitably favors the government.5
From the right they include the contentions that the proportionality idea
places restrictions on types of police actions that should not be subject to
any constitutional regulation and that it mandates judicial activism in the
Lochnerian mold. A principle that can inspire such an outcry from both
sides must have something going for it.
But there is one criticism of the proportionality principle that has con-

siderable punch. That criticism is that any effort to take Terry’s balancing
formula seriously, which is what this book purports to do, is ultimately
unadministrable. Section 3 acknowledges this problem and suggests ways
of handling it.
I. The Case for Proportionality
Terry dealt with the constitutionality of a frisk. Basing its decision on the
Reasonableness Clause of the Fourth Amendment, Terry held that police
may conduct a pat down of the outer clothing if they have a reasonable
suspicion that doing so will prevent harm to themselves or others.6 This
relaxation of the probable cause standard can be, and in large part was,
justiﬁed on proportionality grounds: because a pat down is less invasive
than a full search, the Court said, it does not require probable cause.7
The version of this proportionality idea that is advanced in this book
is built on two propositions: (1) the interest the Fourth Amendment pro-
tects is security from unjustiﬁed government infringement on individuals’
property, autonomy (in the sense of ability to control one’s movements),
and privacy; and (2) the greater the threat to that security, the greater
justiﬁcation the government should have to show. Both propositions are
explored below.
The Security Model versus the Trust and Coercion Models
The ﬁrst proposition—what I call the security model of the Fourth Amend-
ment because of the amendment’s use of the word “secure”—has been
widely accepted by the courts and academics since Katz v. United States.
Property and autonomy were already clearly protected by the Fourth
Amendment at the time Katz was decided;8 that case added privacy as
a protected category. More recently, however, some commentators have
attacked the security model, in particular Katz’s inclusion of privacy within
it. Thus, it is worth emphasizing why privacy is a core value protected by
the Fourth Amendment.
We can begin with the plain language of the amendment, which strongly
suggests that its drafters, who were particularly bothered by indiscriminate
intrusionsintotheirpossessionsbyBritishsoldiersinsearchofuncustomed
goods,9 were trying to protect not only property and autonomy but the
closely associated notion of privacy. The key part of the Fourth Amend-

ment states that the people have a “right . . . to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”
To search means “to look into or over carefully or thoroughly in an effort
to ﬁnd or discover something”10 and to seize means “to take possession of”
or to “lay hold [of] suddenly or forcibly.”11 When the government enters
one’s house to seize one’s possessions, property interests are most directly
implicated. When the government seizes one’s person, autonomy interests
obviously come into play. But when the government engages in a search—
i.e., when it “looks into” one’s house or effects or “looks over” persons
or their papers in “an effort to ﬁnd or discover something”—the interest
most clearly implicated is not property or autonomy but privacy.
This is not to deny that all these terms, and in particular privacy, mean
different things in different contexts.12 Indeed, Katz itself emphasized that
the Fourth Amendment “cannot be translated into a general right to pri-
vacy” and reminded us that “the protection of a person’s general right to
privacy—his right to be let alone by other people—is, like the protection
of his property and of his very life, left largely to the law of the individual
States.”13 But Katz also insisted that the amendment does protect “individ-
ual privacy” against “certain kinds of governmental intrusion,” including
government actions such as bugging and wiretapping that do not involve
physical intrusion.14
As noted above, a number of commentators have questioned the con-
clusion that privacy should be the linchpin of Fourth Amendment search
analysis. I cannot do justice to all these arguments, but I will brieﬂy examine
and counter two representative commentaries as a way of reinforcing why
Katz is right. The ﬁrst such critique comes from Scott Sundby, the second
from William Stuntz (a third, from Morgan Cloud, is taken up in the ﬁnal
chapter of this book).
Professor Sundby contends that privacy is a problematic basis for reg-
ulating searches and seizures for at least three reasons. First, the ease
with which privacy can be manipulated in this technological age makes it
an unsteady, constantly diminishing basis for Fourth Amendment protec-
tion.15 Second, the “right to privacy” rubric no longer convincingly justiﬁes
restriction of the government’s crime prevention efforts; in these days of
“anti-crime hysteria,” those who advocate a criminal “right” will not get
very far unless they are “prepared to explain how the protection beneﬁts
not only the individual claimant but all of society.”16 Finally, because pri-
vacy interests vary with the situation, reliance on privacy as the basis for
Fourth Amendment protection has facilitated the demise of the unitary
probable cause standard, which Sundby clearly prefers, in favor of a rud-

a fourth amendment framework

derless “reasonableness” analysis.17 For these reasons, privacy is no longer
the best lens through which to view the interests implicated by searches
and seizures. In its stead, Sundby proposes that the Fourth Amendment be
reconstrued as a means of maintaining mutual government-citizen trust18
(an approach I call the trust model).
Professor Stuntz disfavors privacy as the animating feature of Fourth
Amendment jurisprudence for somewhat different reasons. He notes that
the modern regulatory state, ranging from tax laws to health and safety in-
spections, involves signiﬁcant intrusions into privacy, some much greater
than those associated with typical law enforcement searches that require
probable cause.19 Yet these regulatory searches could not take place if
they were subject to Fourth Amendment warrant and probable cause re-
quirements, and thus privacy interests do not govern this area of the law.
At the same time, the Supreme Court’s obsession with privacy has led
it to neglect regulation of the force often associated with street searches
and seizures. Bringing these two themes together, Stuntz suggests that
rather than privacy, coercion (i.e., the extent to which a search or seizure
involves a police-citizen encounter) should be the primary focus of the
Fourth Amendment20 (an approach I call the coercion model).
Thesetwoexcellentanalysesmakeanumberofinsightfulpoints.Sundby
is right about the potential malleability of the privacy construct, and his
trust metaphor is a useful heuristic. Stuntz is correct that many regula-
tory actions would be stultiﬁed if they required probable cause and that
the courts have neglected regulation of police coercion in the search and
seizure context. But neither of these scholars provides a convincing sub-
stitute for privacy as a fundamental Fourth Amendment value.
Sundby’s trust metaphor is an elucidating way of explaining why, even
in an age when subjective expectations of privacy have been diminished
substantially, the government must make some showing before it can act;
for instance, covert government surveillance of the public streets does
not infringe subjective privacy expectations (because we don’t know it is
occurring), yet it clearly suggests a lack of trust. As Sundby argues, the state
should trust its citizens until it can produce proof that they do not deserve
to be trusted. But the trust model doesn’t help us ﬁgure out what that proof
should be. For instance, both government intrusions into our houses and
government spying on our public movements evidence a lack of trust and
presumably should be regulated. But should both require probable cause?
Under the trust model one would have to answer yes; otherwise one citizen
is being trusted more than another. Some other referent for measuring the
government’s showing is needed in these very different types of cases.

Thecoercionmodelmightprovidethatreferent:ahousesearchcouldbe
seenasmorecoercivethancoverttracking,justasastreetsearchistypically
more coercive than a regulatory inspection (the paradigmatic comparison
that Stuntz makes). However, these differences can be explained just as
well by pointing to the lesser degree of intrusion associated with public
surveillance and business inspections on one hand and searches of houses
and an individual’s person on the other.21 Furthermore, the coercion model
does not explain nearly as well as the security model why completely un-
coercive searches such as electronic surveillance are regulated but very
coercive searches such as subpoenas for documents or testimony are not
regulated in any meaningful way.
Or consider Terry itself, assuming the correctness of its holding that
frisks may be based on reasonable suspicion of danger. Which approach—
the coercion model, the trust model, or the security model—best explains
that holding? Put another way, which model best explains why a frisk
requires only reasonable suspicion while a full search requires probable
cause?
Under the coercion model, one would presumably argue that a search is
more coercive than a frisk. But the sense in which a search is more coercive
than a frisk is virtually identical to the sense in which it is more invasive;
the coercion comes from the search’s greater intrusion into privacy, its
interference with more types of property, and its more prolonged insult
to autonomy. In other words, the coercion model adds very little to the
security model and, as a semantic matter, may not as accurately reﬂect the
interests involved.
Under the trust model, as I suggested above, there may be no way to
justify the different treatment of searches and frisks. Both actions imply
a lack of trust, yet the trust metaphor does not immediately suggest why
the government needs only a suspicion that the frisked person is not to
be trusted while it must demonstrate probable cause before a search can
take place. A frisk on less than probable cause is unlikely to make people
accustomed to a probable cause standard feel they are sufﬁciently trusted
unless the government can also point to the fact that the invasion visited
on them is minor relative to a full search.
The Danger Exception
A second interpretation of Terry does not rest on a reconceptualized
Fourth Amendment but rather on a very important practical concern: po-

lice safety. On this view, frisks on less than probable cause are permitted
because stopping a suspect presents a danger to police that mitigates the
usual justiﬁcation standard. A number of commentators have suggested
this rationale for Terry and, in doing so, effectively reject the proportion-
ality rationale I am advancing to the extent they insist that danger should
be the only reason the probable cause standard should be relaxed.
Prevention of imminent harm is clearly a legitimate government ob-
jective. In the post-9/11 era, the danger rationale for reducing the gov-
ernment’s burden is particularly attractive. What is not clear, however,
is why concern about danger should lead to an automatic relaxation of
the government’s justiﬁcation without reference to the degree of invasion
associated with the government action.
Most prosaically, a blanket danger exception does not explain the other
“holding” in Terry, involving the constitutionality of the stop before a
frisk occurs. On that issue, the Court declared that police may detain an
individual based merely on reasonable suspicion that “criminal activity
may be afoot.”22 Note that under this language (which was dictum in Terry
but is now clearly the law), protection of the ofﬁcer or others is not an
objective of the initial encounter; otherwise a frisk would be authorized
as soon as the ofﬁcer approached the individual, without the inquiries and
further development of suspicion of danger mandated by Terry. As the
Court stated in moving from its analysis of stops to its treatment of frisks:
Wearenowconcernedwithmorethanthegovernmentalinterestininvestigating
crime; in addition, there is the more immediate interest of the police ofﬁcer in
taking steps to assure himself that the person with whom he is dealing is not
armed with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against him.23
Commentators who like Terry’s indication that stops may take place on
reasonable suspicion (which presumably includes every commentator who
supports Terry’s holding about frisks) need to explain that preference on
grounds other than ofﬁcer safety. The most obvious explanation is that
stops are not as intrusive as arrests.
A second and more important reason for distrusting a prevention-of-
harm exception to probable cause is its potential for swallowing up the
probable cause requirement entirely. The danger rationale has bolstered
Supreme Court decisions permitting sub–probable cause searches of all
custodial arrestees, no matter what the charge,24 and of all cars whose
occupants have been arrested, even if the occupants are nowhere near the

car at the time it is searched.25 The Court has also relied on that rationale
to permit, in the absence of any suspicion, inspections of the area of the
home immediately surrounding an arrestee26 and forced disembarkment
of car occupants.27 Law enforcement ofﬁcials, trained to be suspicious, are
prone to see threats lurking everywhere, and the danger rationale in its
current diffuse form has allowed the Court to cater to those tendencies.
Proportionality analysis would temper these results. A cursory sweep
of a house solely for the purpose of ﬁnding confederates of an arrestee
(whose home has already been invaded) is not particularly intrusive and
might be justiﬁable on reasonable suspicion, as the Court has held. But
a fuller search of the person, car, or personal possessions on less than
probable cause is, contrary to the Court’s insinuation, disproportionate,
because these actions are more invasive than a frisk (which allows police
only to feel objects, not look at their contents).
None of this is meant to imply that the need to prevent harm should
be an irrelevant consideration in setting justiﬁcation levels. The substan-
tive criminal law’s treatment of dangerousness is instructive here. As the
relatively stringent actus reus and mens rea elements of attempt and con-
spiracy illustrate, usually the state must demonstrate a high degree of risk
before conviction may occur. However, for some crimes, ranging from
drunken driving to reckless endangerment, a low probability of risk does
not preclude conviction if the risk is signiﬁcant and imminent.28 The same
concept should apply in connection with searches and seizures. Thus, for
instance, the carnage that would follow from a terrorist act on a plane
justiﬁes preventive steps at airports despite the extremely low likelihood
that any one person boarding the plane is a hijacker.
As this book will emphasize, however, the boundaries of the danger ex-
ception to the proportionality principle must be strictly drawn; otherwise,
the tendency will be to permit frisks of everyone the police encounter,
searches of all cars whose occupants have been arrested, and surveillance
of anyone making overseas calls. When the danger is not signiﬁcant and im-
minent, any reduction below the probable cause standard ought to depend
on intrusiveness considerations, not concerns about danger.
A Sliding Scale versus Probable Cause Forever
One response to these arguments for a ﬂexible Fourth Amendment might
be that, contrary to the assumption made above, Terry’s endorsement of
a lower, reasonable suspicion standard is wrong. This suggestion leads to

a more direct examination of the second proposition set out above—that
the threat to security posed by the government action should determine
the degree of justiﬁcation, so that the greater the threat, the greater the
justiﬁcation the government must show, and the less invasive the action, the
less authorization needed. Justice Douglas, for one, found this proposition
specious. In his dissent in Terry, he argued that if the government action
infringes privacy, property, or autonomy interests to an extent sufﬁcient
to call it a search or seizure, then it should always require probable cause,
no more and no less.29 This “probable cause forever” position has been
endorsed by others as well.30
There are two problems with this position, one pragmatic, the other
normative. First, it exerts enormous pressure on the courts to reduce
the scope of the Fourth Amendment by narrowly deﬁning “search” and
“seizure.” The probable-cause-forever position does not dictate that stops
take place only on probable cause; a second option, apparently endorsed
by the lower courts in Terry itself,31 is to hold that stops do not impli-
cate the Fourth Amendment at all. The latter holding would have been
much more likely had the Terry Court felt compelled to require probable
cause for all seizures. Calling a brief stop a seizure and requiring probable
cause to justify it would either have made crime prevention on the streets
much more difﬁcult or have led to a vast expansion of “preventive crime”
statutes, such as loitering and trafﬁc laws, designed to give police probable
cause for arresting those suspected of being up to no good. Combine the
unattractiveness of these options with the fact, of which the Terry Court
was painfully aware,32 that the exclusionary rule does little to deter low-
level preventive actions in any event, and a holding declaring stops to be
nonseizures might well have seemed the best among bad choices.
Admittedly, a holding that a stop is not a seizure clearly does violence to
the normal meaning of “seizure,” which might have given the Court pause.
But as already suggested in chapter 1, the Court’s cases deﬁning “search”
for Fourth Amendment purposes have shown no compunction in muti-
lating that term beyond recognition. Because, as discussed in more detail
below, the latter development is directly related to the Court’s adherence
to the probable cause standard in the search context, it is highly likely that,
had Terry not adopted a sliding-scale approach in the seizure context, that
threshold would bear even less semblance to common English usage than
it does today.
Even if the Court had resisted this pressure—instead boldly calling the
stop in Terry a seizure and insisting on probable cause for all seizures—it

would have been wrongheaded in doing so. For one thing, such a hold-
ing would have been contrary to both the text and history of the Fourth
Amendment,which indicatethat reasonableness, not probable cause, is the
touchstone of substantive Fourth Amendment regulation.33 Just as impor-
tantly, the probable-cause-forever position cuts against the intuition, re-
ﬂectedthroughoutourjurisprudence,thatthegovernment’sburdenshould
vary depending on the effect of its actions on the individual.34 The stan-
dard of proof in criminal trials is different from that in civil commitment
proceedings because of the perceived differences in the deprivation of lib-
erty that each brings.35 Levels of scrutiny in constitutional litigation vary
depending on whether the individual right infringed by the government is
“fundamental” or not.36 In the entitlements context, the degree of process
due before beneﬁts can be terminated depends on the effect of the termi-
nation.37 Outside the constitutional setting, the same sort of thing holds
true. In the tort context, for instance, many courts require greater proof
for punitive damages than for compensatory damages.38
A probable-cause-forever standard thus cuts against a pervasive nor-
mative-legal intuition. If taken seriously, it also means that, just as we may
not relax the required government justiﬁcation, we also can’t ratchet it
upward. Thus, requiring something more than probable cause for elec-
tronic surveillance and serious bodily intrusions such as surgery, as the
Supreme Court has done,39 would be inconsistent with a unitary approach.
Under the proportionality principle, on the other hand, such superprotec-
tion makes sense given the serious privacy invasions associated with such
actions.
II. Revamping the Proportionality Principle
To say that Terry’s proportionality principle is the appropriate framework
for Fourth Amendment analysis is not to say that the Court’s version of
that principle is acceptable. Indeed, the way the Court has manipulated
Terry’s insight has usually been disingenuous. Even when it has adhered
to the spirit of Terry, the Court has failed to develop any good framework
for applying the balancing formula.
Reﬁnement of that framework, or at least a start at doing so, is the goal
of this part of the chapter. Both the assessment of invasiveness that the
proportionality principle demands and the manner in which the govern-
ment can justify its invasions require analytical schemes that have yet to

ﬁnd their way into the case law. Subsequent chapters will ﬁne-tune the
analysis in the surveillance setting.
Operationalizing Invasiveness
To implement Terry’s proportionality principle, some assessment of the
invasiveness of the police action in question must be made. The Supreme
Court’s efforts in this regard have been abysmal. The Court has been re-
miss in three areas: deﬁning the threshold of the Fourth Amendment,
differentiating the various degrees of invasiveness, and incorporating into
invasiveness analysis other constitutional considerations.
the fourth amendment threshold.
As many commentators have
pointed out, the most obviously ﬂawed Fourth Amendment decisions from
the Court, alluded to in chapter 1, are those telling us what is not governed
by that amendment: prosecutorial demands for bank records and phone
number logs, use of undercover agents, trespassing on cornﬁelds, ﬂyovers
ofbackyards,riﬂing through curbsidegarbagebags, using enhancement de-
vices to conduct surveillance of public movements and business property,
and so on. These decisions exempt a vast array of investigative techniques
fromthewarrantandjustiﬁcationrequirementsintheFourthAmendment.
The Supreme Court is almost as unimpressive when it comes to telling
us what is not a Fourth Amendment “seizure”: interrogations on buses,
chases of ﬂeeing youths, pointed questioning about alienage at one’s place
of work, and requests for ticket and identiﬁcation at airports.40 Perhaps if
people were told they had the right to terminate such encounters (which
the Court insists they have)41 and the police honored that right, then con-
tinued cooperation with the police could sensibly be said not to implicate
the Fourth Amendment. But the Court does not require such a warning,42
nor, if one were given, would it likely alleviate the inherent coercion of
such confrontations.43
This line of decisions is the direct result of a twofold abuse of Terry.
The ﬁrst abuse is the implicit use of Terry’s proportionality principle to de-
termine the threshold of the Fourth Amendment. Although the Court has
never acknowledged as much, the only good explanation for the Court’s
unwillingness to regulate so many actions that are clearly searches and
seizures is that it has decided that the cost to law enforcement of doing so
outweighs the “minimal” intrusions involved.44 Such an application of the
balancing formula is barred by the language of the Fourth Amendment it-

self. That provision’s prohibition on “unreasonable searches and seizures”
applies the reasonableness test only after something has been labeled a
search or seizure.
The second abuse of Terry in this context (which inevitably follows
from the ﬁrst) is the failure to apply its proportionality principle to actions
that should have been designated searches and seizures. If the Court had
been willing to recognize that some relatively less invasive “searches” and
“seizures” can take place on less than probable cause, it would have felt
much more comfortable broadening the deﬁnition of those two terms. In-
deed, in many of the decisions in which the Court rejected application of
the Fourth Amendment, the police had developed a degree of suspicion
that might have justiﬁed the action under proportionality reasoning. For
instance, in Oliver v. United States, which permitted trespass on private
property outside the curtilage, the police were acting on “reports” that the
defendant was raising marijuana on his farm.45 In California v. Ciraolo
and California v. Greenwood, respectively permitting suspicionless ﬂy-
overs and riﬂing through garbage, the police were acting on tips about
drug possession.46 In California v. Hodari D., holding that chases are not
seizures, the police had seen the defendant ﬂee before them.47
Although the police in these cases did not have probable cause, they
may have had enough suspicion to justify, under a proportionality scheme,
their relatively uninvasive actions. If so, the Court could have eaten its cake
and had it too. It could have brought these actions within the compass of
the Fourth Amendment and still approved them. Instead it has read vast
domains of intrusive police action out of the Fourth Amendment.
establishing a hierarchy of invasiveness.
These examples lead to
the next question about invasiveness that the Court has failed to answer
satisfactorily: how should we gauge the relative intrusiveness of a police
action that is considered a search or seizure? For instance, does it make
sense to say that a trespass on “open ﬁelds” is more intrusive than surveil-
lance on the public streets but less invasive than a search of the home?
Without an answer to these types of questions, proportionality analysis is
impossible.
A central assertion of this book is that the reference point for evaluating
the relative invasiveness of different police techniques should be the same
as it is for determining whether an action is a search or seizure in the ﬁrst
instance: Katz’s declaration that the Fourth Amendment protects expec-
tations of privacy that “society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.”

In other words, some assessment of societal attitudes about the relative
intrusiveness of police actions should inform the analysis. As has already
been suggested and will become clearer below, the Court has pretty much
ignored this precept, with predictably anomalous results.
Society’s views about privacy and autonomy can be gleaned in at least
two ways. The ﬁrst is to look at positive law—property, contract, and tort
doctrine—for clues as to what we think is private.48 From this perspective, it
is hard to justify the Court’s conclusions that no invasion of security occurs
when police trespass on private property, ﬂy in airspace that the Federal
Aviation Administration has declared off-limits, or requisition records that
the bank has promised will remain conﬁdential.
When, as is often the case, the positive law is ambiguous or does not
address a particular situation, a second method of determining when so-
ciety expects privacy is to pose that question to its members. In a study
reported in 1993, Joseph Schumacher and I presented ﬁfty different sce-
narios, all based on Supreme Court cases, to 217 randomly selected in-
dividuals and asked them to rate the scenarios’ intrusiveness on a scale
of 1 to 100.49 Chapters 4 and 7 report the results of two similar, more
recent studies focused directly on surveillance techniques. Chapter 4 also
addresses methodological concerns about this type of research, as well as
the larger issue of whether empiricism can ever settle normative questions.
Assuming, for now, that such research is relevant to Fourth Amendment
issues, comparing what it tells us about society’s privacy expectations to
the Court’s views on that matter is instructive.
Some of the Court’s intuitions about invasiveness are borne out by our
research. With respect to seizures, for example, the Court has told us that a
Terry stop is less invasive than an arrest, and that a brief stop at a sobriety
roadblock is less invasive than either a stop or an arrest.50 With respect to
searches, the Court has indicated that searches of houses and luggage are
more invasive than searches of cars,51 which in turn are more invasive than
frisks,52 drug testing in the school or workplace,53 and most other searches
in the latter two arenas.54 It has also indicated that regulatory inspections
of gun and liquor stores and the like are even less invasive.55 Our survey
results are consistent with these decisions. Identical or similar scenarios
presented to our subjects yielded a similar hierarchy.
In many other cases, however, a wide chasm exists between the Court’s
holdings and our subjects’ intrusiveness rankings. Not surprisingly, the gap
between the Court’s views and the views of the “society” we sampled is
greatest in those cases in which the Court has held that police action does

not implicate the Fourth Amendment. Relevant to the subject matter of
this book, for example, our sample viewed undercover activity of intimates
and government perusal of bank records, both of which the Court has left
unregulated, as much more invasive than a Terry pat down.56 A propor-
tionality approach based on this research would not only denominate the
former investigative activities as “searches” but might well require more
than reasonable suspicion to justify them. Similarly, whereas ﬂyovers of
backyards and looking through garbage bags were not considered as intru-
sive as a pat down,57 they were seen as much more intrusive than looking
at the exterior of a car or using a magnetometer at an airport.58 These
ﬁndings suggest that under a proportionality rule, some credible reason
for the former types of action is necessary.
Our research also calls into question some Court decisions about in-
vestigative techniques that the Court is willing to call a search or seizure.
Take, for instance, the Court’s assumptions that we expect appreciably
less privacy at school and at work, in cases such as New Jersey v. T.L.O.59
(holding that search of a pupil’s purse for evidence of disciplinary infrac-
tions does not require probable cause), Board of Education v. Earls60 (up-
holding suspicionless drug testing of students involved in extracurricular
activities), and National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab61 (uphold-
ing suspicionless drug testing of customs agents). A theoretical rationale
for recognizing diminished privacy protection in these locales, obliquely
suggested in these cases,62 is that many of the searches conducted there
are relatively benign, particularly when they can be characterized as ad-
ministrative rather than criminal in objective. And indeed, our research
suggests that when the motivation of a search or seizure is protective or
facilitative rather than adversarial, the perceived intrusiveness of the ac-
tion diminishes signiﬁcantly. Illustrative is the ﬁnding that subjects viewed
rummaging through luggage at an airport as no more intrusive than a dog
sniff;63 apparently, this result stemmed from the perception that this search
is designed to prevent a serious danger that could not effectively be averted
in other ways (and thus coalesces with the narrow danger exception de-
scribed earlier). Equally low on the intrusiveness scale were searches of
sixth grade lockers and inspections for the purpose of ensuring safe living
and working conditions;64 here the results may bespeak a willingness to
accept a particular type of paternalism.
However, our research also suggests that when searches in these settings
are not imbued with facilitative aims, people’s privacy expectations, con-
trary to the Court’s assumption, are heightened. Apparently, as far as our

survey participants were concerned, searches of purses for contraband in
the school (as in T.L.O.) and drug testing in the school and workplace (as in
Earls and Von Raab) are not as easily encompassed by the “Family Model”
of criminal procedure;65 they are perceived as adversarial invasions rather
than paternalistic. If that is an accurate assessment of society’s expec-
tations, the proportionality principle would demand greater justiﬁcation
than mere assertions that schools and workplaces have drug problems,
which is the only justiﬁcation, later discussion will show, that the Court
provides in these cases. Because the judicial justiﬁcation for some types of
surveillance is often similarly vague, this aspect of proportionality analysis
is particularly relevant to this book.
incorporating other interests into invasiveness analysis.
A
third deﬁciency of the Court’s case law is closely related to the second.
As Professor Amar has pointed out,66 the Court has failed to take into
account the interests aside from privacy, property, and autonomy that are
protected by other provisions of the Constitution. The First Amendment
(in connection, for example, with searches of newspaper ofﬁces or diaries
and other very private papers), the Sixth Amendment (in connection with
subpoenas of attorney’s ﬁles), the Equal Protection Clause (where race is
involved), and the Due Process Clause (where police conduct shocks the
conscience)allmayindependentlyaddweighttotheindividual’ssideofthe
balance, thus requiring more by way of government justiﬁcation. More will
be said later in this book about how these supplementary considerations,
in particular the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause, affect
regulation of surveillance. Here the focus will be on the implications of
the Equal Protection Clause for search and seizure law, because racial
issues so pervade the government’s efforts to investigate crime that they
deserve special attention.
Some of the most provocative writing in this regard has come from
Tracey Maclin. Professor Maclin provides convincing proof that minori-
ties are targeted for stops and other police confrontations and that they
have come to expect and resent such treatment.67 From this observation
he argues that in evaluating individual interests under Terry, the Court
should take race into account; the added anxiety that people of color feel
when confronted by the police or when they know they are singled out for
surveillance should be considered in determining invasiveness.68
There is no doubt that a given investigative technique’s potential for
racially disparate impacts should be considered in ﬁguring out how to

regulate it. Government should not send the message that race can form
the basis for discriminating among citizens, and thus should not single
out racial or other groups (unless a known perpetrator with speciﬁc racial
characteristics is being sought).69 Police can also lessen the subjective sense
of invasion that minorities feel during confrontations by explaining the
basis for the police action; our research conﬁrms that knowledge of the
objective of a search reduces the sense of intrusion.70
Maclin’s prescription, however, would seem to go further, by requiring
that police contemplating a search or seizure demonstrate a greater degree
of suspicion if their target is black rather than white. If so, it runs into a
number of difﬁculties. An individual’s reaction to a police search or seizure
will vary widely with race, gender, age, and hundreds of other variables,
including previous experiences. More important, perceptions of privacy
among African Americans, or any other minority group for that matter,
will vary immensely. Accurately assessing these variations and then fairly
taking them into account in measuring invasiveness would be impossible.
Furthermore, as the Court has noted on several occasions,71 the police
cannot be expected to perceive these types of sensitivities in most cases.
As with other legal constructs, then, concepts such as privacy and intrusion
probably should not be tailored to individual sensitivities. It is also worth
noting that giving blacks more leeway to commit crime, the end result of
Maclin’s suggestion, would hardly improve the race problem.
Another partial solution to the race problem, one that Maclin himself
proposes, is to overrule Terry. Because it eschewed probable cause, Maclin
asserts, “the ruling in Terry was a signiﬁcant setback in the ﬁght against
discriminatory police tactics.”72 But reversing Terry, which would mean
giving up on the proportionality principle, goes too far, for three reasons.
First, reasonable suspicion is not a hunch; it requires an articulable
belief that criminal activity is afoot. In Terry, the repeated casing of a store
window by Terry and his colleagues gave Ofﬁcer McFadden good reason
to suspect they were planning a burglary. In contrast, some of the examples
of discriminatory action that Maclin gives, such as the dragnet roundups
of black youth in the wake of the Charles Stuart shooting,73 are clearly not
authorized by Terry. Maclin may be right that an ofﬁcer who confronts a
black man “knows that he has unchecked discretion to make the stop.”74
But that is not Terry’s fault; it is the fault of a society that does not make
the ofﬁcer obey Terry.
That observation leads to the second point. Maclin’s target should not
be Terry but the lack of remedies for discriminatory police action. As

the Terry Court itself pointed out,75 the exclusionary remedy is virtually
useless in this situation because most stops never lead to a prosecution
in which to invoke it. Other current sanctions—jury damages, injunctions,
criminal penalties, internal sanctions—are unlikely to take care of this
problem. Juries don’t like taking money from cops or giving it to criminals;
prosecutors aren’t likely to bring criminal charges against the police for
any reason, much less a bad stop; and, given their ethos and the pressure
from the public to solve crime, police cannot be counted on to remedy
this situation themselves.76 Rather, as chapter 8 sets out in more detail,
an administrative damages remedy operated by an ombudsman indepen-
dent of the police—who can discern patterns of misbehavior better than
attorneys with individual clients and who can make ofﬁcers pay out of their
own pocket for bad faith and discriminatory actions and make departments
pay for failure to train members effectively on race issues—is a much more
powerful remedial device than these traditional ones.
Third, once such an effective remedy is in place, the version of Terry’s
proportionality doctrine advanced here is ultimately more likely than a
probable cause standard to deter discriminatory action against African
Americans and other people of color. One reason is that it avoids the
pressure that a probable-cause-forever standard creates to enact low-level
crime prevention statutes and to leave investigative stops (as well as casual
police-citizen encounters) entirely unregulated. Another is that it does not,
like a probable cause standard would, abandon preventive law enforce-
ment. As Randall Kennedy has suggested, the latter outcome might well
visit real discrimination on communities of color, given the fact that they
tend to be victimized by crime much more often than other communities.77
Justiﬁcation Schemes
Assessing the intrusiveness of an investigative action is the ﬁrst step in
proportionality analysis. The second step is determining when a particular
intrusion is justiﬁed. Consistent with proportionality reasoning, Terry rec-
ognized that one justiﬁcation standard was not enough for this purpose,
and it created reasonable suspicion to help ﬁll the void. The Court has
since resorted to the reasonable suspicion standard in several search cases,
especially in “special needs” situations that do not involve “ordinary law
enforcement” (e.g., searches for disciplinary or workplace infractions, or
drug testing for safety purposes). In some of these situations even reason-
able suspicion is not required, but merely an assertion that government

has a strong need to forgo the warrant and individualized suspicion re-
quirements.78 In other cases involving particularly invasive searches, the
Court appears to require more than probable cause.79 But in none of these
cases has the Court attempted to delineate the relationship between these
various standards.
To better protect privacy interests and implement the proportionality
idea, I propose here a more explicit justiﬁcation hierarchy, one that con-
sists of four tiers and that applies across the board to all searches and
seizures. To probable cause and reasonable suspicion should be added a
higher standard of clear and convincing evidence and a lower standard
of relevance. Below is a description of the four standards, along with an
examination of when they would apply and a brief exploration of how this
framework ﬁts with the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment.
the four tiers.
The probable cause and reasonable suspicion stan-
dards are well established and fairly well deﬁned. Probable cause is often
equated with a more-likely-than-not (51 percent) ﬁnding, or perhaps a
level of certainty somewhat below that.80 Reasonable suspicion, in con-
trast, has been associated with approximately a 30 percent level of cer-
tainty.81 The quantiﬁcation of these standards may seem artiﬁcial and even
misleading, given the difﬁculty of translating percentages into anything
police and magistrates can use on the street. But it is similar to the way we
talk about standards of proof. For instance, the reasonable doubt standard
is often discussed in terms of our willingness to let nine guilty people go
free to ensure that one innocent person is not convicted. To get some idea
of the type of justiﬁcation we want to require for police actions, we need
to think about analogous normative queries.
Pursuing this line of inquiry, it is clear that if proportionality reasoning
is to be taken seriously, two levels of justiﬁcation are insufﬁcient. Some
government actions such as bodily surgery, perusal of private diaries, and
prolonged undercover operations are much more intrusive than an arrest
or search of a home and thus should require more than probable cause as
it is currently deﬁned. Speciﬁcally, these more invasive actions should take
place only if there is clear and convincing proof that the evidence thereby
sought is crucial to the state’s case, a standard that might be quantiﬁed at
the 75 percent level of certainty.
At the other end of the spectrum are searches and seizures that are
much less intrusive than the ﬁve- to ten-minute stops the Supreme Court
has authorized based on reasonable suspicion; examples of these might

be brief seizures at roadblocks, casual questioning, and searches of busi-
nesses. To regulate these government actions, a fourth justiﬁcation level—
the relevance standard—should be formally recognized under the Fourth
Amendment. As chapter 6 details, the relevance standard is commonly
associated with subpoenas and, under the evidentiary rules, it describes
evidence that has any tendency to make a fact in issue more probable than
not. This standard would simply require police or prosecutors to articulate
a reason for believing their action has some tendency to lead to information
that would help solve a crime or apprehend a suspect. Put statistically and
arbitrarily, it might be equated with a 5 percent success rate. Using legal
terminology, the relevance standard could require police to demonstrate
an objective credible belief that a legitimate law enforcement objective
will be achieved through the police action.82
The above prescriptions are not cast in stone; they are simply meant to
illustrate how proportionality analysis might work. Under a proportion-
ality approach, the animating inquiry in setting levels of suspicion should
be how much explanation for a given intrusion is necessary to convince
an innocent person subjected to it that the police acted reasonably. The
innocent person who is arrested or the target of bedroom surveillance will
expect a “damn good reason” for the inconvenience and intrusion. The
innocent person who is stopped on the street for a brief interrogation or
tracked by a public camera is likely to be satisﬁed with a less extensive
explanation for the government attention. The ofﬁcial excuse for a mis-
taken action should be adequate, but need be no more than adequate, to
dissipate the umbrage the action excites. This is the central insight of the
proportionality principle: the justiﬁcation for a search or seizure should
nullify its intrusiveness, no more and no less.
the myth of individualized suspicion and the importance of
rationality review.
The next aspect of the justiﬁcation scheme that
needs signiﬁcant ﬁne-tuning concerns the type, rather than the amount,
of evidence the government must proffer in order to meet its justiﬁcatory
burden. The courts often recite the idea that suspicion must be “individ-
ualized.”83 Terry itself appeared to endorse this position, stating that “in
determining whether the ofﬁcer acted reasonably . . . , due weight must
be given, not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or ‘hunch,’
but to the speciﬁc reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from
the facts in light of his experience.”84 One consequence of this preference
for particularized suspicion is frequent judicial expression of concern over

police use of “investigative proﬁles” based on statistical information, par-
ticularly those relying on correlations between certain types of behavior or
features and criminal activity (e.g., drug courier proﬁles).85 To distinguish
this nomothetic, or group-based, type of evidence from individualized sus-
picion, I will call it generalized suspicion.
The case against reliance on generalized suspicion appears to be prem-
ised on the idea that the use of proﬁles and the like undermines human
autonomy and the notion of individualized justice.86 But the distinction
between individualized and generalized suspicion is, in all relevant re-
spects, meaningless. To justify the stop he made in Terry, Ofﬁcer McFad-
den needed the general knowledge about behavior of criminals that he
had learned from his thirty-nine years on the force as much as his speciﬁc
observations of Terry and his compatriots. Indeed, in the last half of the
sentence quoted from Terry in the previous paragraph, the Court recog-
nized precisely that fact. Put another way, had Ofﬁcer McFadden taught a
class of rookies how to identify potential burglars, those ofﬁcers who later
relied on his stereotypes and behavioral tips in nabbing their ﬁrst Terry
would not somehow be violating the Fourth Amendment.87 If a proﬁle can
produce the success rate required by the proportionality principle, then
the fact that it focuses on status or membership in a group should not be
important (unless, for reasons discussed earlier, the group is deﬁned by
race or ethnicity).88
The hostility toward generalized suspicion is not only conceptually mis-
guided but also pragmatically insidious. Without such a notion there can
be no meaningful justiﬁcation requirement in a vast number of search and
seizure scenarios where separating the innocent from the guilty on an “in-
dividualized” basis is all but impossible. Consider that, as construed by the
Supreme Court, the Fourth Amendment imposes virtually no limitations
on roadblocks for the purpose of detecting illegal immigrants and drunken
drivers, or on drug testing of customs workers and student athletes, or on
regulatory inspections of residences and businesses, even though the Court
concedes that all these situations involve searches or seizures.89 Rather,
leery of imposing difﬁcult-to-meet individualized suspicion requirements
in these situations, the Court has been satisﬁed with claims by the govern-
ment that its action will address a “signiﬁcant” criminal or regulatory prob-
lem;90 once this allegation is made, the Court adopts a hands-off stance. In
traditional constitutional jurisprudence terminology, the Court is at best
engaging in rationality review, which is always extremely deferential to
executive and legislative decisions91 and is a recipe for pretextual actions—

the use of roadblocks, regulatory inspections, and other group searches and
seizures for hidden purposes.
A proportionality regime that recognizes the generalized suspicion con-
cept, in contrast, would signiﬁcantly circumscribe this type of government
power. Assume that the government wants to initiate drug and alcohol
testing using urinalysis in a particular workplace. Assume also that the
government cannot demonstrate individualized cause, that is, cause based
purely on observation of individuals’ behavior at work, either because
drugged behavior is not easily observable or because it is too difﬁcult to
post observers over everyone. While the Court would probably permit the
drug testing so long as there is some evidence that drug use could threaten
health or safety,92 a proportionality analysis would require more. Assuming
that urinalysis testing is sufﬁciently invasive so that under the proportional-
ityprincipleitrequiresprobablecause(deﬁnedaboveasabouta 50percent
level of certainty), the government would need to show that roughly 50
percent of the relevant employees are at risk for drug use. Only if it can
demonstrate a generalized suspicion at the requisite level should it be able
to conduct the test.
How, one might ask, is the government to generate the necessary show-
ing if the testing program has yet to commence? Often the government
has other ways of developing cause; after all, a rational agency will es-
tablish a drug testing program only after a conspicuous problem arises.
Furthermore, by the time such programs are challenged in court, they
have usually been in operation for some time and have produced relevant
statistics. Thus, in Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Association, the
government was able to show, from various sources, that at least forty-
ﬁve of the train accidents and incidents that occurred between 1975 and
1983 were caused by drug- or alcohol-impaired employees.93 If that num-
ber amounts to about half the incidents during that period, the requisite
generalized suspicion would exist for anyone who causes or is involved in
a train accident or safety violation. If it doesn’t, individualized suspicion
would typically need to be shown before a particular individual could be
tested. Other examples of this type of analysis, involving surveillance, are
provided later in this book.
Ifthisjustiﬁcation schemestrikes thereader as artiﬁcial, technocratic, or
too activist, consider the comments of Justice Antonin Scalia in his dissent
in National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, where the majority
upheld drug testing of customs agents. Scalia was livid about the holding,
calling it “a kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic

opposition to drug use.”94 Not normally associated with a fondness for de-
tailed judicial oversight, Scalia nonetheless argued that the Court should
have to ﬁnd some “social necessity” before approving a drug testing pro-
gram, and asserted that the majority provided no “real evidence of a real
problem that will be solved by urine testing of Customs Service employ-
ees”; rather, the majority’s holding was based on “nothing but speculation,
and not very plausible speculation at that.”95 In support of this point, he
noted that only 5 agents out of 3,600 customs employees had tested pos-
itive for drugs.96 Thus, even Scalia recognizes that some type of concrete
justiﬁcation is needed before courts afﬁrm government intrusions.
The difﬁculty, of course, is determining what sort of justiﬁcation is nec-
essary. For the sake of argument, let us assume that drug testing deters
and detects dangerous drug use. Would a hundred positive tests have been
enough to justify the drug testing program in Von Raab? Or would thirty
have been sufﬁcient? When is there “real evidence of a real problem”? The
proportionality principle, working in tandem with the generalized suspi-
cion concept, provides a way to answer these questions. Assuming, again,
that the invasion associated with drug testing should require probable
cause (and that there is no airport-like signiﬁcant and imminent danger
presented by drug-using customs agents), the Court in Von Raab should
have demanded that roughly half of the 3,600 employees test positive in
order to justify mass testing. That number may seem high, but then so is
the intrusiveness of a drug test.
If one’s intuition is still that a mass drug-testing program should not
be so easily frustrated, consider the scenario from another perspective.
About 7 percent of the American population as a whole, and 19 percent
of those between the ages of 18 and 25, have used illegal drugs in the past
thirty days.97 If one believes, say, that a hundred positive tests in the Von
Raab sample (3 percent of the total) represents a “real problem,” then
the Fourth Amendment would present no obstacle to nationwide drug
testing (at least if one assumes that use of drugs by young adults can be
just as dangerous as use of drugs by customs agents). That result would be
offensive to most, including, I would guess, the majority in Von Raab.
In short, Fourth Amendment analysis should mimic equal protection
rationality review “with bite,” if not strict scrutiny. Courts evaluating the
reasonableness of a search or seizure, whether it is in the street or regula-
tory in nature, or whether it is of an individual or a group, should demand
from the government a speciﬁc showing of need that is proportionate to
the invasion or, if that showing is not forthcoming, a good reason why

the relevant information cannot be generated.98 Courts should not allow
what the Supreme Court has permitted: searches and seizures justiﬁed
solely by vague assertions about the magnitude of whatever problem the
government has targeted.
A caveat to this stance might arise when the authorization to conduct
the group search or seizure comes from the legislature rather than a mu-
nicipality, government bureaucracy, or police department. In such a case,
political process theory would hold, courts are obligated to show defer-
ence to the democratically made decision.99 It is noteworthy, however,
that with one exception,100 none of the group search cases considered by
the Supreme Court involved legislative action; rather, the roadblocks, drug
tests, and other actions at issue in those cases were triggered by executive
ofﬁcials or low-level deliberative bodies unrepresentative of the general
polity. Furthermore, even legislative action does not deserve deference
under political process theory if the legislature delegates all important
discretionary decisions to executive ofﬁcials or enacts a law that impinges
on a discrete and insular minority having little or no say in the deliberative
process.101 Unfortunately, one or both of these conditions will likely be
present in the typical case.
Thus,generalizedsuspicionreviewofgroupsearchesandseizuresisnor-
mally warranted. Although this type of review is a throwback to Lochner-
ism (named after the case, Lochner v. New York, that most conspicuously
involved the Court in a much-maligned series of decisions second-guessing
legislators),102 it is defensible for three reasons. First, there is the Court’s fa-
mous exemption from Lochnerian analysis, in footnote 4 of United States v.
Carolene Products, for government actions affecting fundamental rights.103
Second, as Professor Amar has noted, the Fourth Amendment’s prohibi-
tion on “unreasonable searches and seizures” appears to call explicitly for
substantive due process analysis.104
Finally, as already suggested, any other approach could easily lead to
emasculation of the Fourth Amendment’s protections. In an article be-
moaning the difﬁculty of applying the Fourth Amendment in the modern
context, Michael Seidman illustrates the consequences of failing to adopt
the approach advocated here with an example that directly implicates not
only the Terry scenario but many types of surveillance discussed in this
book.105 As he notes, “[T]here is no constitutional right to sidewalks; in
principle, walking on sidewalks could be treated as a highly regulated ac-
tivity.”106 If so, he points out, the government could interrupt that activity
at will, on the theory that people wishing to get from one place to another

consent to such intrusions when they choose to use public walkways, just as
gun dealers consent to random searches of their stores when they enter the
weapons business. Noting that the Court has yet to explain how it would
distinguish the two situations, Seidman concludes that “the rejection of
Lochner makes it difﬁcult to evaluate the justice of various background
conditions.”107 He is right, and that is precisely why we should not re-
ject Lochner in the Fourth Amendment context. Given the government’s
ability to manipulate our surroundings, immensely enhanced by the tech-
nological developments described in chapter 1, we might otherwise face
the elimination of concrete justiﬁcation requirements for any search or
seizure.
the warrant clause and the proportionality principle.
Until
now I have not touched on the role of warrants under a proportionality
regime. Terry, of course, held that a warrant was not necessary to autho-
rize a stop and frisk, a holding that made sense given the exigencies of
the situation. But when there is no exigency, ex ante review of the search
by some independent ofﬁcial should be preferred—a tenet this book will
call the exigency principle. William Stuntz has noted that such review both
eliminates the hindsight bias that can infect ex post review and makes
perjury by the police difﬁcult, given their ignorance about what they will
ﬁnd.108 To these advantages a third can be added: ex ante review, at least
meaningful ex ante review, prevents illegal searches and seizures and the
breach of privacy and trust that goes with them. Research from the Na-
tional Center for State Courts indicates that while magistrates have been
known to rubberstamp warrant applications, the mere fact that they must
be consulted signiﬁcantly increases the standard of care among police and
prosecutors pursuing an investigation.109 Like doctors, police should seek
a second opinion if there is time to do so.
If these reasons convince one to require pre-authorization in all nonex-
igent circumstances, a conﬂict between the text of the Fourth Amend-
ment and the proportionality principle arises. The Fourth Amendment’s
Warrant Clause states that warrants shall issue only upon probable cause.
Thus, if warrants are the vehicle for providing ex ante review, searches and
seizures that the proportionality approach permits on less than probable
cause, as currently deﬁned, could not be authorized by a warrant.
There are three ways of handling this conﬂict, all sanctioned by one
or more Supreme Court decisions. The ﬁrst is to redeﬁne probable cause
to mean the cause that makes probable the reasonableness of the intrusion

occasioned by a given search or seizure. This is essentially how Camara
v. Municipal Court,110 a Supreme Court decision handed down one year
beforeTerry,lookedatprobablecauseinconnectionwithresidentialsafety
inspections. The Court there held that warrants for such inspections could
issue based solely on a probable cause showing that the conditions of
the area to be inspected merited the intrusion.111 Under this sliding-scale
deﬁnition, probable cause would subsume the four tiers described above,
and a warrant could constitutionally authorize searches and seizures in
a host of situations that do not require probable cause as it is presently
deﬁned.
If that gambit is considered too confusing, or too inconsistent with
Fourth Amendment history,112 a second alternative would be to develop
other methods of ex ante review. The Supreme Court has recognized at
least two contexts in which what might simply be called a “court order”
could issue on less than probable cause. In Hayes v. Florida, the Court
statedindictum“thatundercircumscribedprocedures,theFourthAmend-
ment might permit the judiciary to authorize the seizure of a person on
less than probable cause and his removal to the police station for the pur-
pose of ﬁngerprinting.”113 In United States v. Karo, the Court indicated that
court orders authorizing beeper tracking of items inside a residence might
constitutionally be issued based on reasonable suspicion.114
Finally, of course, there is the tack the Court most commonly prefers:
retaintheunitaryprobablecausestandardandinsistthatexanteauthoriza-
tions meet that standard. For the reasons given above, the ﬁrst or second
approaches are preferable to this one.
It must be admitted that even with the advent of telephonic warrants,115
the costs of requiring ex ante review for all nonexigent searches and
seizures would not be negligible in a regime that deﬁnes the scope of
the Fourth Amendment as broadly as this chapter has. Those costs could
be mitigated to some extent by permitting the review to be carried out by
administrators rather than judges when the search takes place in an admin-
istrative context, an idea that is applied to some surveillance settings later
in this book. In any event, the cost of ex ante review, whatever it may be,
is worth the extra security. Law enforcement agents, even when acting in
good faith, can easily get carried away in their pursuit of criminals. Ex ante
review makes them think twice before barging in doors, planting tracking
devices, or mining personal records.

III. The Proportionality Principle: An Unworkable Rorschach
Blot?
Reacting to the proportionality idea six years after Terry was decided,
Anthony Amsterdam made two comments. The ﬁrst is one I have stolen
for this book: “A sliding scale approach would considerably ease the
strainsthatthepresentmonolithicmodeloftheFourthAmendmentalmost
everywhere imposes on the process of deﬁning the Amendment’s outer
boundaries.”116 The second comment was far more critical: “Present law
is a positive paragon of simplicity compared to what a graduated Fourth
Amendment would produce.”117 He added that the sliding-scale approach
would convert the Fourth Amendment “into one immense Rorschach
blot.”118
There is no doubt that the assessment of relative invasiveness and the
multiple tiers of justiﬁcation that the proportionality principle demands
are complex. But this scheme is not necessarily muddier than the present
one, at least as it has developed since 1974, when Amsterdam made his
Rorschach jibe. Many of the Court’s rulings since then have often required
subtle evaluations of intrusiveness.119 These rulings also demonstrate, con-
trary to Amsterdam’s suggestion, that the courts are quite capable of deal-
ing with the proportionality approach. Most obviously, they have been
applying a graduated Fourth Amendment in the seizure context since at
least Terry v. Ohio.120 Further, despite what they say, courts often taken
the same approach where searches are involved. Exhibit One is once again
Terry, which held that a frisk requires only reasonable suspicion.
In any event, the justiﬁcation hierarchy described here (as opposed to
how it should be applied) is virtually identical to the Court’s own temp-
late—the probable cause and reasonable suspicion standards are obviously
ﬁrmly ensconced, the relevance standard is routinely applied in subpoena
cases, and the clear and convincing standard is not that far removed from
the requirements the Court has imposed in surgery and communications
surveillancecases,wherethegovernmentmustdemonstratethatthesearch
is the only means of proving a crucial element of its case.121 If there is a
signiﬁcant difference in clarity between current law and the rejuvenated
proportionality principle advanced in this chapter, it may be in the other di-
rection. The scheme proposed here makes more explicit how invasiveness
is to be assessed and thus should provide a clearer picture of the rela-
tive intrusiveness of different types of police actions. It also deﬁnes more
concisely the types of justiﬁcations the government must put forward.

Finally, the discretion granted police by the proportionality approach
can be bounded in several ways. First, as has occurred over time with the
amorphous language of the Fourth Amendment, application of the pro-
portionality principle to recurring situations would undoubtedly lead to
the development of relatively clear “rules,” most of which, as this book
will suggest, would be no different from today’s rules, except that the level
of certainty required for given actions would be more explicit and (some-
times) more demanding. Second, in developing these rules, only rough
proportionality should be the goal: in some cases, individual (or state)
interests may be sacriﬁced, at least marginally, to achieve greater clarity.
Third, where clear rules do not develop, the police would at least have
an easily remembered “standard of thumb” that will help ﬁll in the gaps.
Finally, if ex ante review is required in all nonexigent circumstances, as the
exigency principle requires, then often an independent party, rather than
law enforcement ofﬁcials, would be applying the proportionality principle.
Conclusion
If the underlying rationale of Terry were dusted off and rejuvenated, the
proportionality and exigency principles that emerged would provide a
comprehensive yet ﬂexible framework for regulating government inves-
tigative efforts. All government searches and seizures would be regulated,
not just those that rise above some ill-deﬁned level of intrusion. Investiga-
tions of groups and institutions, as well as of individuals, would require con-
crete justiﬁcation proportionate to the invasion they perpetrate. Nonexi-
gent searches would be subject to pre-authorization. All of this could be
instituted without denying law enforcement the ability to be proactive, an
ability that would be circumscribed under a more rigid approach requiring
probable cause for all searches and seizures. Nor need ex ante review, when
it is required, always involve a cumbersome judicial process.
It is now time to apply these concepts to the subject matter of this book.
Under the proportionality and exigency principles, physical and transac-
tion surveillance would no longer be outside the purview of the Fourth
Amendment. At the same time, that amendment’s probable cause and
warrant language would apply in only a limited number of situations. The
advantages to both individuals and government of a regulatory framework
governed by these principles should become apparent in the following
pages.

chapter three
Peeping Techno-Toms
I
n Kyllo v. United States,1 the Supreme Court purportedly struck a blow
for the sanctity of the home, in an age when technology threatens to
destroy it. This chapter wonders whether Kyllo is a Pyrrhic victory. It also
explains why various aspects of the decision offend the proportionality
and exigency principles discussed in chapter 2 and how surveillance of the
home would be governed by these principles.
Prior to Kyllo, the majority of lower courts had held that use of a ther-
mal imaging device to detect heat sources within a house is not a Fourth
Amendment search, either because the heat waves detected by such de-
vices are “abandoned” and do not require physical intrusion to discern, or
because they are too impersonal to warrant privacy protection.2 In Kyllo,
the Supreme Court rejected these rationales and concluded that the gov-
ernment may not mechanically measure the warmth of the home unless
it demonstrates probable cause for doing so. The Court’s decision could
also be read to say that most other scientiﬁcally enhanced investigations
of the domicile are searches as well, and thus might indicate a desire to put
signiﬁcant restrictions on all technological surveillance of our most private
sanctuary.
If so, the ruling is a good one. But the Court left at least one loophole
in its decision, a loophole that could become quite signiﬁcant. Its precise
holding stated that “where, as here, the Government uses a device that is
not in general public use, to explore details of the home that would previ-
ously have been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance is
a ‘search.’ ”3 As the dissenters in Kyllo rightly pointed out, varying Fourth
Amendment regulation of technology with the prevalence of that technol-
ogy is troublesome, because “the threat to privacy will grow, rather than
recede,astheuseofintrusiveequipmentbecomesmorereadilyavailable.”4

Much depends on how the Court deﬁnes “general public use.” One
might be comforted by the majority’s insistence (indeed, it was “quite con-
ﬁdent”)5 that despite its availability from more than half a dozen national
companies,6 the type of thermal imaging device at issue in Kyllo is not in
general use. As this chapter will document, however, today’s marketplace
offers a wide array of much cheaper enhancement devices that are easily
bought over the Internet and from nationwide chains and specialty shops.
The march of progress guarantees that this trend will accelerate. Thus, the
dissent’s caution in Kyllo should be taken seriously.
The majority’s sole response to this caution was the disquieting state-
ment that the dissent’s “quarrel . . . is not with us but with this Court’s
precedent.”7 Here it cited California v. Ciraolo,8 which held, in the context
of airplane ﬂyovers, that the privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment
is no greater than the privacy one can expect from the public at large—
and a decidedly curious public at that (one composed, for instance, of
members who look closely at plants growing in backyards from low-ﬂying
airplanes).9 If that is to be the Court’s approach to police use of technology,
then the Kyllo dissent may be right in its suggestion that the general use
exception will eventually swallow the Court’s newly minted prohibition
of technologically enhanced investigation of homes. That prediction is, if
anything, strengthened by Ciraolo’s companion case, Dow Chemical Co.
v. United States.10 There the Court held that while “surveillance of private
property by using highly sophisticated surveillance equipment not gener-
ally available to the public” might well require a warrant, use of a $22,000,
high-magniﬁcation mapmaking camera to surveil the exterior of secluded
business premises does not.11
Ciraolo and Dow Chemical both involved observation of curtilage, not
the inner domain of the house. Perhaps the Court will deﬁne general public
use differently depending on the target of the surveillance, and insist that
police always obtain warrants to carry out technological searches of homes,
as it did in Kyllo and in United States v. Karo,12 which held that use of a
beeper to discover the contents of a house is a search. But as I document
below, the lower courts have not let walls get in the way of technological
innovation. Several have held that observation of the home interior using
ﬂashlights, binoculars, and more sophisticated illumination and magniﬁca-
tion devices is not always a search. Of course, ﬂashlights and binoculars
are much more common than the newer search enhancers. But as the Kyllo
dissent implies, thermal imagers and beepers may be the ﬂashlights and
binoculars of tomorrow. More important, even the more mundane types
of technology can visit signiﬁcant intrusion on home dwellers.

Inthischapter,Iarguethattheextenttowhichaparticulartechnological
device is used by the general public, and the related inquiries into whether
it is generally available or highly sophisticated, should be irrelevant to
Fourth Amendment analysis. On a more fundamental level, I argue that
the Court’s willingness to limit Fourth Amendment privacy to areas that
are free from naked eye observation, a willingness that is apparent in many
of the Court’s cases and that appears to be codiﬁed in Kyllo, is inconsis-
tent with the Fourth Amendment. Although the reasoning advanced here
applies to all police investigative actions, the focus will be on the use of
technology to investigate goings-on inside the home and similarly private
locations. Use of technology to conduct surveillance of public areas is
treated in the next two chapters.
Section 1 of this chapter summarizes the law regarding both the gen-
eral public use exception and what I will call the “naked eye exception”
as they are described in Kyllo, other Supreme Court decisions, and the
lower courts. Section 2 explains why these concepts are unsustainable in
theory and incoherent in practice. Section 3 proposes two solutions to
the problems posed by technological searches. The ﬁrst is based on the
proportionality principle, which dictates that “search” be deﬁned broadly
for Fourth Amendment purposes (so that any intentional surveillance of
a house would require some suspicion) but permits police to search on
less than probable cause when their actions are not particularly intrusive.
The second proposal is that Congress enact a statute prohibiting use of
technological devices under circumstances analogous to those speciﬁed in
Title III with respect to eavesdropping instruments.
The ﬁrst proposal might strike some as a nonstarter, given the Court’s
grudging deﬁnition of search, on one hand, and its apparent insistence,
on the other, that actions denominated as searches be based on probable
cause. But the Court has yet to deﬁne reasonable expectations of privacy
in connection with technologically enhanced house searches, so it is not
too late to adopt an expansive view of “search” in this particular context.
As for the probable cause dogma, the lower courts, which have to deal with
the run-of-the-mill case on a daily basis, have often ignored it, something
the Supreme Court has come close to doing as well.
If the proportionality approach is viewed as too radical in this con-
text, the second proposal is offered as a worthy substitute. Generally, that
proposal would criminalize nonconsensual technological surveillance of
home interiors and similar locations by civilians. Visual surveillance de-
vices would therefore never lawfully be in “general use” for the purpose
of spying on homes and the like, and that reality would in turn render the

general public use exception as applied to private areas irrelevant, even as
technology becomes more prevalent.
I. The General Public Use and Naked Eye Exceptions
The general public use doctrine is of ephemeral origins. Perhaps as a result,
its scope is very imprecise. Also unclear is how it interacts with other
factors relevant to Fourth Amendment analysis, including the naked eye
exception. These three matters are explored below.
Genesis
As noted in chapter 1, until the 1960s, the Fourth Amendment protected
against government trespass in four areas: houses, persons, papers, and ef-
fects. The prevalence of technology the police used was irrelevant. The sole
inquiry was whether operation of the technology required intrusion into
a protected area. If so, a search occurred; if not, the Fourth Amendment
was not implicated.
Katz supposedly changed all that. Trespass doctrine was discarded in
favor of the expectation-of-privacy rubric. But, as chapter 1 also noted,
Katz added that “what a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in
his own home or ofﬁce, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.”
In Ciraolo, the Supreme Court relied on that language in concluding
that naked eye observation of a backyard surrounded by a fence ten feet
high, from an airplane ﬂying at one thousand feet, is not a search. In con-
text, the Court’s use of this aspect of Katz is instructive:
The Fourth Amendment protection of the home has never been extended to
require law enforcement ofﬁcers to shield their eyes when passing by a home on
public thoroughfares. Nor does the mere fact that an individual has taken mea-
sures to restrict some views of his activities preclude an ofﬁcer’s observations
from a public vantage point where he has a right to be and which renders the ac-
tivities clearly visible. . . . “What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even
in his own home or ofﬁce, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.”
The observations . . . in this case took place within public navigable airspace,
in a physically nonintrusive manner. . . . Any member of the public ﬂying in
this airspace who glanced down could have seen everything that these ofﬁcers
observed. On this record, we readily conclude that respondent’s expectation

that his garden was protected from such observation is unreasonable and is not
an expectation that society is prepared to honor.13
The Court used the same reasoning in Florida v. Riley,14 where it held that
observing a backyard from a helicopter, this time only four hundred feet
above the ground (but still in navigable airspace), is not a search. In both
cases, the Court assumed that members of the public might engage in the
type of behavior the police did, and reasoned from that assumption that
the behavior did not offend reasonable expectations of privacy.
In neither Ciraolo nor Riley did the Court focus on the fact that the
police were using technology (aircraft) to carry out their observations.
In Ciraolo, however, the Court did state that “in an age where private
and commercial ﬂight in the public airways is routine, it is unreasonable
for respondent to expect that his marijuana plants were constitutionally
protected from being observed with the naked eye from an altitude of
1,000 feet.”15 It was this sentence that the Court would later cite in Kyllo
in support of its general public use exception to technological surveillance
of the home.16
Although a companion case to Ciraolo, Dow Chemical’s contribution
to the general public use exception was formulated somewhat differently.
In ﬁnding that the Environmental Protection Agency’s use of a $22,000
mapmaking camera to photograph Dow Chemical’s plant was not a search,
the Court focused on the camera’s availability and capabilities rather than
its prevalence. Again, the relevant language is worth looking at in context.
Itmaywellbe,astheGovernmentconcedes,thatsurveillanceofprivateproperty
by using highly sophisticated surveillance equipment not generally available to
the public, such as satellite technology, might be constitutionally proscribed
absent a warrant. But the photographs here are not so revealing of intimate
details as to raise constitutional concerns. Although they undoubtedly give EPA
more detailed information than naked-eye views, they remain limited to an
outline of the facility’s buildings and equipment. The mere fact that human
vision is enhanced somewhat, at least to the degree here, does not give rise to
constitutional problems.17
This language, like the opinion in Ciraolo, makes clear that the extent
to which the public has access to a given technology is only one of many
considerations in the Fourth Amendment calculus. More will be said about
this multifactor approach below. For now, it is enough to observe that the

foregoing cases represent the sum total of the Supreme Court’s pronounce-
ments on the general public use concept. On this score, the lineage from
Katz to Kyllo is thin indeed.
The lower courts, in contrast, provide many pre-Kyllo and post-Kyllo
examples of judicial reliance on the general public use rationale. For in-
stance, in the pre-Kyllo decision State v. Vogel, the court held that police
use of a camera with a zoom lens to photograph the interior of a residence
was not a search, in part because there was “no showing that the cameras
and lenses used [were] sophisticated visual aids” or “special equipment
not generally in use.”18 In State v. Rose, the court concluded that use of a
ﬂashlight to aid peering into a mobile home is not a search, in part because
a ﬂashlight is “an exceedingly common device.”19 Several cases have used
the same kind of language in concluding that no search occurs when police
use zoom or other magniﬁcation lenses to observe curtilage just outside
the home.20 Finally, at least two post-Kyllo cases have said the same about
police use of night scopes to observe home interiors or curtilage, despite
the relative sophistication and expense of these devices.21
A number of other decisions have permitted enhanced observation of
homes and curtilage, using devices ranging from binoculars to Star-Trons
(night scopes with magniﬁcation capacity), without speciﬁcally mention-
ing the general public use concept. But they have either clearly assumed
that such visual enhancement does not change the Fourth Amendment
analysis22 or noted that the use of more sophisticated devices might have
changed the result.23 Thus, the routine use and general availability notions
brieﬂy alluded to in Ciraolo and Dow Chemical have heavily inﬂuenced
the lower courts.24
Deﬁnitions
Despite the number of cases mentioning the issue, the general public use
concept remains amorphous. As noted above, a number of courts seem to
believe that ﬂashlights and binoculars, and perhaps night scopes as well,
are in general public use. The Supreme Court has indicated that airplanes
(in navigable airspace) and mapmaking cameras are also in general use
but that thermal imagers are not; given the Court’s decision in Karo v.
United States requiring a court order when a beeper is used to discern
activity within a home, tracking devices should probably be added to the
latter category.25 But no court has put forth a more general deﬁnition of
the general public use concept. Until we get one, the thumbnail sketch of

the case law provided above suggests three basic deﬁnitions, each of which
is itself divisible into two or more versions.
The ﬁrst basic deﬁnition focuses on whether the technology in question
is generally available to the public—the language found in Dow Chemical.
“Generally” means “usually” or “as a rule,”26 while “general” means “ap-
plicable to the whole.”27 “Available” means “accessible” or “obtainable,”
or “ready for immediate use.”28 Accordingly, a generally available item is
one that all or virtually all members of the public are able to obtain. Taken
literally, this deﬁnition would exclude much surveillance technology, ex-
cept perhaps the cheapest ﬂashlights. It would certainly not encompass
mapmaking cameras or low-ﬂying airplanes, suggesting that this is not the
deﬁnition the Court would endorse.
Moving to a broader deﬁnition of this ﬁrst basic approach, general avail-
ability could be construed to mean that the item is available to a substantial
portion of the public. Under this deﬁnition, indicia of general availability
might be the number of items manufactured, the cost of the item, and the
number of outlets carrying it. More colloquially, this deﬁnition could be
dubbed the “Wal-Mart test.” If the item is available at Wal-Mart, it is likely
to be affordable to and accessible by a large segment of the public.
Flashlights are generally available in this sense. They are usually in-
expensive (a high-beam version costs as little as $8, batteries included;
a Cyclops 10 Million Candle spotlight goes for about $38) and can be
purchased at nationwide stores such as Wal-Mart, K-Mart, and Target as
well as numerous local stores. Binoculars are not as prevalent but are still
relatively cheap, ranging from $30 for a pair with a magniﬁcation capacity
of 10 (10x) to $197 for binoculars with 16x power. Cameras equipped with
zoom lenses are also fairly easy to purchase, with Wal-Mart prices ranging
from $60 to $100 for cameras with 2x to 4x magniﬁcation power. This much
is common knowledge.29
What might be somewhat surprising is that Wal-Mart also offers in-
expensive versions of highly powerful telescopes and night vision equip-
ment. The Polaris 60EQ-A Telescope, described as “an extremely power-
ful, 60mm telescope that offers contrast-rich, high-resolution images not
found in smaller scopes,” can be purchased for $65. Night vision binoculars
costing between $400 and $725 purport to permit magniﬁed night viewing
“even in total darkness.” These devices may not be in every home, but they
are certainly much more widely available to the general public and much
less sophisticated than the $22,000 mapmaking camera in Dow Chemical.
The second, less expansive basic deﬁnition of the general public use

concept adheres more closely to the words in that phrase rather than Dow
Chemical’s “generally available” language: how often does the public use
a particular type of technology? Generally available items may not be
commonly resorted to. For instance, although most of the aforementioned
devices are obtainable by a sizeable portion of the public, their use is quite
varied; people rely on ﬂashlights all the time, binoculars and zoom lenses
somewhat less frequently, and telescopes and night vision equipment less
frequently still.
At the same time, all these items are everyday paraphernalia to cer-
tain segments of the population, and are relied on at least as frequently
as low-ﬂying airplanes in carrying out certain types of endeavors. Bird-
watchers, sports fans, hunters, and opera enthusiasts make avid use of
binoculars. Tourists and loving families focus their zoom lenses on a daily
basis. Telescopes are a favorite of stargazers, and night vision devices are
popular with hunters. The number of these groupings and their size will
only expand as time marches on. Also worth noting is the Court’s apparent
endorsement of this “subgroup” approach to the general use doctrine in
Dow Chemical, where it emphasized that the device relied on in that case
was “a conventional, albeit precise, commercial camera commonly used in
mapmaking.”30
That observation leads to a third, narrower basic deﬁnition—general
public use for a particular purpose. Most of these devices, even if generally
available and used by large segments of the public, are not usually used
the way police use them. In particular, they are probably not normally
employed to look into homes or curtilage.
As the Court demonstrated in Riley, there are several versions of this
approach as well. A plurality of justices in that case (including Justice
Scalia, author of Kyllo) adopted what might be called a positivist approach,
ﬁnding the fact that planes could legally ﬂy within four hundred feet of the
grounddispositiveofwhetherobservationofcurtilagefromthatheightwas
a search.31 This stance, as the Riley dissent pointed out, in essence asserts
that “the expectation of privacy is defeated if a single member of the public
could conceivably position herself to see into the area in question without
doing anything illegal.”32
The other ﬁve justices took an empirical approach to the issue. Jus-
tice Sandra Day O’Connor, in a concurring opinion, concluded that if
overﬂights at four hundred feet are rare, then they should be consid-
ered searches even though technically in navigable airspace (although she
ended up deciding they were not rare in the locale at issue, and thus joined

the plurality in ﬁnding that no search occurred in Riley).33 The four dis-
senters in Riley ﬁne-tuned the empirical approach further, asking whether
overﬂights at four hundred feet for the speciﬁc purpose of observing the
contents of residential backyards are rare, and deciding that they were
exceedingly so.34
Interaction with Other Factors
Besides the deﬁnitional ambiguity, another potential source of confusion
about the general public use doctrine is that it is only one of many factors
possiblyrelevanttothesearchissue.Forinstance,followingDowChemical,
a mapmaking camera aimed from an airplane is not a search if the target is
business curtilage, but, as the Court suggested in Dow Chemical and Kyllo,
it may become a search if the interior of the home is the focus. In fact, an
examination of the Court’s decisions reveals seven variables the justices
haveaddressedindeterminingwhetherpoliceuseoftechnologyisasearch.
In addition to the availability of the technology to the general public, they
have considered (1) the nature of the place to be observed; (2) the steps
taken to enhance privacy; (3) the degree to which the surveillance requires
a physical intrusion onto private property; (4) the nature of the object
or activity observed; (5) the extent to which the technology enhances the
natural senses; and (6) the extent to which the surveillance is unnecessarily
pervasive,invasive,ordisruptive(i.e.,becausethepolicefailedtotakesteps
to minimize the intrusion).35
Ciraolo, Riley, and Dow Chemical illustrate application of each of the
six factors. With respect to the nature of the area surveilled, all three cases
emphasized that the home and surrounding curtilage are accorded the
most signiﬁcant privacy protection.36 On the issue of privacy enhancement,
Ciraolo noted that the ten-foot fence, although clearly meant to shield the
backyard from street-level viewing, would not have barred observers on
trucks or double-decker buses (!) from seeing the marijuana,37 and the
majority in Dow Chemical scoffed at Dow’s assertion that keeping track
of the identiﬁcation numbers of overﬂights was an adequate precaution
against this type of privacy invasion.38 All three cases also emphasized
that the overﬂight did not require physical intrusion onto the property.39
Concerning the nature of the activity observed, the majority opinions
in Dow Chemical and Riley asserted that the helicopter observers did
not see any “intimate” activities in the backyard.40 With respect to the
potencyoftheenhancementused,DowChemical distinguishedthecamera

observation in that case from technological observation that can penetrate
walls.41 And on the issue of minimization, Riley noted that the helicopter
caused no “undue noise” or any “wind, dust, or threat of injury.”42
Post-Kyllo, courts will have to ﬁgure out how important the general
public use factor is in relation to the other six factors. Fortunately, in
contrast to its failure to deﬁne the general public use exception, Kyllo
does a fairly good job of answering this question. First, as this chapter
has already discussed at length, Kyllo indicates that the extent to which
technology used by the police is also used by the public is very important;
although technically dicta, two acknowledgments of the general public
use exception occur in the opinion.43 Second, Kyllo also clearly afﬁrms
that the interior of the home (factor 1 above) is normally accorded full
Fourth Amendment protection.44 Third, Kyllo indicates that when the area
observed is the interior of the home (as opposed to the curtilage at issue in
Ciraolo, Dow Chemical, and Riley), four of the other ﬁve factors are either
of secondary importance or are entirely irrelevant in deciding whether a
Fourth Amendment search has occurred.
To verify this last point, consider Kyllo’s treatment of factors 2 through
6. On steps taken to enhance privacy (factor 2),the Kyllo majority was at
its most opaque, for it did not directly address the dissent’s point that the
defendant could have avoided the discovery of the heat waves by “making
sure that the surrounding area [was] well insulated.”45 Perhaps the majority
did not think the matter important enough to address. More likely, as
explained below, this factor remains crucial.
In contrast, the majority forthrightly dismissed the dissent’s argument
that the imager “did not penetrate the walls of petitioner’s home”46 (factor
3), stating “we rejected such a mechanical interpretation of the Fourth
Amendment in Katz, where the eavesdropping device picked up only
sound waves that reached the exterior of the phone booth.”47 To the as-
sertion that the thermal imager detected no intimate details (factor 4),48
the majority once again minced no words: “In the home, our cases show,
all details are intimate details, because the entire area is held safe from
prying government eyes.”49 And the dissent’s attempt to show—through
its observations about the various other ways the heat inside Kyllo’s home
could have been detected50—that the imager merely replicated what care-
ful unenhanced surveillance would have discerned (factor 5) was “quite
irrelevant” to the majority.51 The majority continued:
The fact that equivalent information could sometimes be obtained by other
means does not make lawful the use of means that violate the Fourth Amend-

ment. The police might, for example, learn how many people are in a particular
house by setting up year-round surveillance; but that does not make breaking
and entering to ﬁnd out the same information lawful. In any event, on the night
of January 16, 1992 [the date of the surveillance], no outside observer could
have discerned the relative heat of Kyllo’s home without thermal imaging.52
Although the ﬁnal variable—concerning steps taken to minimize the sur-
veillance—was left unaddressed by the Kyllo majority, presumably that
factor too is irrelevant when the surveillance is of the home. If all activities
therein are intimate, then no level of minimization sufﬁces.
Before concluding, however, that general public use is the only factor
relevant to deciding whether sense-enhanced surveillance of the home is a
search,lookagainattheholdinginKyllo:“Where,ashere,theGovernment
uses a device that is not in general public use, to explore details of the home
that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion,
the surveillance is a ‘search’ . . .”53 In an earlier phrasing of its holding,
the Court stated, “We think that obtaining by sense-enhancing technology
any information regarding the interior of the home that could not other-
wise have been obtained without physical ‘intrusion into a constitutionally
protected area’ constitutes a search—at least where (as here) the technol-
ogy in question is not in general public use.”54 The italicized portions of
these statements, taken together, announce that if the activity observed
could be seen with the naked eye (or detected with other unenhanced
senses) without physical intrusion into the constitutionally protected areas
of home or curtilage, then police may exploit any technology—generally
used or not—without implicating the Fourth Amendment (whereas if the
activity cannot be directly detected with the naked senses in the absence of
physical intrusion, the police may use only common technology to conduct
warrantless enhanced surveillance).
This second exception to the general prohibition on enhanced surveil-
lance of the home interior—the naked eye exception—suggests that in
addition to the general public use idea, factor 2 is very important in assess-
ing technological observation of the home. If one does not take steps to
enhance one’s privacy, such as drawing curtains over windows or fencing
off one’s yard, then naked eye observation of the interior of the home
from outside the house is much more likely. And in those situations, Kyllo
allows police use of any technology—not just common devices—to view
the same details.
After Kyllo, then, the determination of whether technologically en-
hanced home surveillance is a search depends on two factors: whether the

technology is in general public use and, if it is not, whether the techno-
logically enhanced surveillance detects only details that would have been
viewable without technology, from an area unprotected by the Constitu-
tion. If either the general public use or the naked eye exception applies,
then no search has occurred.55 It is now time to examine whether these
various aspects of Kyllo make sense.
II. Kyllo’s Problems
To the extent it endorses the general public use concept or the naked eye
exception, the ruling in Kyllo is seriously ﬂawed. The following discussion
demonstrates that conclusion from three perspectives. The ﬁrst is prag-
matic: both the general public use and the naked eye doctrines are virtually
impossible to apply in a meaningful manner. The second perspective is the-
oretical: despite the courts’ insinuation to the contrary, these two concepts
cannot, as a logical matter, ﬂow from Katz’s “knowing exposure” language.
The third perspective is normative: society should be constitutionally en-
titled to expect that government will refrain from spying on the home in
any manner—technological or otherwise—unless it can demonstrate good
cause for doing so.
The Public Use/Naked Eye Quagmires
An earlier section of this chapter has already indicated the numerous pos-
sible meanings of “general public use.” There are at least three broad deﬁ-
nitions of that phrase (general availability, general use, and general use for
a particular purpose), and each of those deﬁnitions can be subdivided into
alternative deﬁnitions that vary widely. For instance, interpreting “gen-
eral” to mean “of the whole,” the general availability rubric might cover
only the most common devices (such as ﬂashlights or binoculars). In its
Wal-Mart guise, however, it could also encompass zoom cameras, night
vision equipment, and telescopes. And if one takes Dow Chemical’s use
of the term seriously, then even $22,000 mapmaking cameras qualify. In
contrast, the general use rubric, in its narrowest version, might not even
include binoculars, because that item is probably not routinely used by
most of the population. But “general use” could also fairly be construed
to include binoculars as well as any other device used by a large subgroup
of the population (including airplanes and zoom cameras).

Finally, the narrowest of the three deﬁnitions, general use for a particu-
lar purpose, could also encompass many devices—or it could exclude all of
them, depending on whether a positivist or empirical approach is taken and
on which purpose is at issue. As a matter of positive law, use of ﬂashlights
and binoculars on the public thoroughfares is permissible; thus, if one were
to follow the plurality’s approach in Riley (which apparently considered
curtilage-viewing from any ﬂight within navigable airspace near an air lane
to be routine), such use might not be a search even if it happened to disclose
activities inside the home. As an empirical matter, however, people may
seldom use public vantage points to peer into others’ homes, and fewer still
use ﬂashlights or binoculars, much less more sophisticated equipment, to
do so; one could probably say such instances are “rare.” Even home obser-
vation aided by the most widely adopted forms of technology—eyeglasses,
for instance—might thus constitute a search.
In short, the possible permutations of the general public use doctrine
are myriad and perhaps overwhelming. To this problem, which admittedly
besets other legal doctrines as well, is added the vexing quandary alluded
to by the Kyllo dissent: how are the courts to deal with the rapid pace of
technological development in deciding whether something is in general
public use? Although the Court has declared that thermal imagers do not
ﬁt in this category, it may have to change its stance in the future, given the
increasing reliance on such devices.56 Night vision equipment, although
also relatively new, is even more widely used and much less expensive. If
a declaration that these items are in general public use is hard to imagine,
consider that the zoom camera—a device that at least two courts have
considered generally available57—did not come into being until 1986.58
And, as already noted, since Kyllo two other courts have declared that
night scopes are in general public use.
In short, advanced technology can ﬁnd its way into the average home
very quickly (something the history of ﬂashlights and binoculars veri-
ﬁes).59 When that happens with devices such as night scopes and beepers—
and perhaps thermal imagers—the courts will have to either change their
stance, manipulate the meaning of the general public use doctrine, or ig-
nore the doctrine altogether. None of these options is very palatable, either
as an institutional matter for courts used to following precedent or as a pol-
icy matter for police, litigants, and citizens trying to organize their affairs.
Conscientious courts will also be ﬂummoxed by Kyllo’s position on po-
lice use of technology that is not in general public use. Here they must
determine whether the details seen with technology would also have been

viewable with the naked eye without physically intruding into a constitu-
tionally protected area. The ﬁrst conundrum raised by this formulation is
its inherently paradoxical nature. If naked eye viewing without physical
intrusion could have occurred, why didn’t it? If the answer is (as it often will
be) that the police were worried they would be discovered, thus leading the
targets to stop what they were doing or to hide it better, then the interior
details arguably could not have been seen with the naked eye. The Court
probably did not intend this investigative paradox. Assuming so, it has
left courts with the puzzle of determining both the extent to which fear of
detection should be factored into the analysis and how to discern whether
that fear existed.60
Putting this problem aside would not end the difﬁculties associated
with the Court’s naked eye ruling. Again, that ruling holds that enhanced
searches of the home are permissible if they merely duplicate naked eye
searches from vantage points that are not constitutionally protected. Many
imponderables will surely arise in making this determination. Is the cur-
tilage always a constitutionally protected area? What if it “invites” the
public onto it with sidewalks and similar arrangements? Do apartment
buildings have curtilage? Assuming that the naked eye viewing could take
place without physical intrusion on a protected area, are there any restric-
tions on how it could occur? Can it be hypothesized that police would have
climbed trees, peered through cracks, and looked between half-drawn cur-
tains in determining whether the naked eye would have spied the activities
actually observed with the enhancement device?
Lower courts have already had trouble grappling with these types of
questions in dealing with unenhanced viewing of the interior of the home.
Although virtually all courts hold that looking through an open door or
window from a public vantage point is not a search,61 in other situations
one court’s sufﬁciency of precaution is another court’s complete failure to
take adequate steps to protect privacy. Cases often come down to whether
curtilage is secluded enough, a fence high enough, a curtain drawn enough,
or a crack in the door small enough.62 Because it requires courts to specu-
late whether a hypothetical naked eye could have lawfully observed what
the enhanced viewing detected in such circumstances, Kyllo’s formulation
profoundly exacerbates an already difﬁcult judicial task. Even more daunt-
ing is the possibility that the general use and naked eye exceptions could
work together, so that no search occurs when police use novel technology
to spy on activities that naked eye viewing or viewing with technology in
general use could have observed. Because observation with generally used

technology is apparently meant to be equated with naked eye observation
in terms of privacy expectations, this bootstrapping of the two exceptions
is not implausible.
Technologically Enhanced Observation and Knowing Exposure to the
Public
The problems with the general public use and naked eye doctrines go much
deeper than difﬁculties in pinning down their meaning. Ultimately neither
doctrine is sufﬁciently grounded in Fourth Amendment theory, either as
laid out in Katz or as a more general proposition.
This conclusion is particularly evident when one tries to connect these
doctrines with Katz’s “knowing exposure” language. As section 1 of this
chapter explained, in Ciraolo the Supreme Court relied on the statement
in Katz that activities “knowingly exposed to the public, even in [the] home
or ofﬁce” do not deserve Fourth Amendment protection, and Kyllo later
cited Ciraolo to bolster its adoption of the general public use exception.
Yet the logical connection between this aspect of Katz and the Court’s
rules concerning technologically enhanced home surveillance is extremely
tenuous. Almost by deﬁnition, activities in the home that are observed
using enhancement devices are not “knowingly” exposed to the public.
As suggested above, police usually use technology because they want to
ensure the target does not know about the surveillance and because they
believe naked eye viewing is not feasible.
The only cases cited by the Katz opinion to support its “knowing ex-
posure” language were Lewis v. United States63 and United States v. Lee.64
Both involved scenarios quite different from enhanced observation of the
home. In Lewis, the Court held that no search occurred when an under-
cover agent entered Lewis’s home after Lewis had invited him there un-
der the impression that the agent wanted to buy drugs.65 In contrast to
the person subjected to covert technological surveillance, Lewis knew he
was disclosing information to a third party. In Lee, the Court held that
no search occurred when government agents used a searchlight to discern
cans of alcohol on the deck of Lee’s boat. Whether or not Lee knowingly
exposed these cans to public view (arguably he intended to hide them
under cover of darkness), they were clearly positioned on the equivalent
of the boat’s curtilage, not in its interior, a point the Court seemed to ﬁnd
important when it stated, “[I]t is not shown that there was any exploration
below decks or under hatches.”66 In Lewis, there was “knowing” exposure.

In Lee, the home interior was not involved. The Kyllo scenario differs from
both.
Virtually all of the Court’s post-Katz decisions ﬁnding that the Fourth
Amendment is not implicated ﬁt one of these two molds. Either the de-
fendant knowingly revealed information to a third party, who turned the
information over to the government,67 or the exposure did not occur inside
the home.68 Taken together, the Court’s cases stand for the proposition that
covert (i.e., undetected) observation of activities within a domicile triggers
the Fourth Amendment.
There is admittedly one post-Katz case involving government seizure
of information from inside the home that does seem to have jettisoned
the “knowing” requirement. In Smith v. Maryland,69 the Court held that
even if a person does not know that the numbers he calls are recorded by
the phone company, he assumes the risk that they will be.70 Similarly, it
might be said, one assumes the risk that activities inside the home that can
be seen with generally used technology or by a (hypothetical) naked eye
observer from outside the home will in fact be viewed in those ways.
Assumption-of-risk reasoning in this context is vacuous, however. We
only assume the risks of unregulated government intrusion that the courts
tell us we have to assume. The most pertinent illustration of that fact is
Kyllo itself. As noted at the beginning of this chapter, until the Supreme
Court’s decision in that case, most jurisdictions had settled that we did
assume the risk that police would subject the interior of our houses to
thermal imaging without obtaining a warrant or developing any level of
suspicion that evidence of crime would be discovered. Ultimately, despite
their constant citation by the lower courts and the Supreme Court, nei-
ther the knowing exposure language of the Katz majority opinion nor the
modiﬁed (assumption of risk) version thereof poses the proper question.
Rather, the correct inquiry is that suggested by Justice Harlan’s concurring
opinion in Katz: is suspicionless observation of the home interior using
enhancement devices something that “society is prepared to recognize as
‘reasonable’ ”? Kyllo itself accepted this point, and it is to that issue we
now turn.
Technologically Enhanced Observation and Reasonable Expectations of
Privacy
The Kyllo majority recognized that “the Katz test—whether the individ-
ual has an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize

as reasonable—has often been criticized as circular, and hence subjective
and unpredictable.”71 Yet, the Court continued, at least “in the case of the
search of the interior of homes—the prototypical and hence most com-
monly litigated area of protected privacy—there is a ready criterion, with
roots deep in the common law, of the minimal expectation of privacy that
exists, and that is acknowledged to be reasonable.”72 From this premise
the majority reached its holding that enhanced surveillance, relying on
technology that is not in general public use and that detects more detail
than any lawful naked eye observation could have, is a search. “This,”
claimed the Court, “assures preservation of that degree of privacy against
government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.”73
Thus, the Court grounded its analysis of privacy expectations vis-à-vis
enhanced home surveillance on historical assumptions. To the extent the
Court believed history also supported the general public use and naked
eye exceptions to its holding, however, it may well be wrong. In any event,
if the scope of the Fourth Amendment as applied to technological surveil-
lance depends on expectations “society is prepared to recognize as ‘rea-
sonable,’ ” as both Kyllo and this book assume, we ought to consult more
recent sources than attitudes that predated the invention of ﬂashlights and
binoculars by more than a century (and most other technological surveil-
lance techniques by almost two centuries). Modern law and empirical work
suggest that society is not prepared to recognize either exception.
As far as history is concerned, there is not much to go on. The Kyllo ma-
jority quotes the famous statement from the seminal English case Entick
v. Carrington74 that “the eye cannot by the laws of England be guilty of
a trespass.”75 Although that statement is irrefutably true, given that the
common law of trespass required a physical intrusion, it does not answer
the historical question posed in Kyllo, which is whether naked eye or nom-
inally enhanced viewing of the home violated colonial notions of privacy.
The one Supreme Court case that directly addressed this issue, decided in
1948, appeared to conclude that it did. In McDonald v. United States,76 a
government agent stood on a chair to look into McDonald’s room through
the door transom. In ﬁnding that this action was a search, the Court dis-
missed the argument, based on Entick, that “the eye cannot commit the
trespasscondemnedbytheFourthAmendment.”Despitethefactthattres-
pass doctrine still governed Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the Court
stated that it would not “stop to examine [Entick’s] syllogism for ﬂaws” but
instead would simply “reject the result” that Entick’s formulation would
have required in McDonald.77

Other than the quote from Entick, the signiﬁcance of which McDonald
clearly undermined, Kyllo provides nothing in support of its view that
eighteenth-century Americans were unfazed when strangers spied into
their homes from a public vantage point. In contrast, we do know that
the drafters of the Fourth Amendment were obsessed with protecting the
security of the house. As John Adams put it,
An Englishmans [sic] dwelling House is his Castle. The Law has erected a Fortiﬁ-
cation round it—and as every Man is Party to the Law, i.e. the Law is a Covenant
of every Member of society with every other Member, therefore every Member
of Society has entered into a solemn Covenant with every other that he shall
enjoy in his own dwelling House as compleat a security, safety and Peace and
Tranquility as if it was surrounded with Walls of Brass, with Ramparts and
Palisades and defended with a Garrison and Artillery.78
Thomas Davies’s comprehensive treatment of Fourth Amendment his-
tory conﬁrms that at the time the Constitution was drafted, the law pro-
vided that “except for extraordinary circumstances, an ofﬁcer could not
justify‘breaking’(thatis,opening)theouterdoorofahouseunlessheacted
pursuant to a judicial warrant.”79 Further, as Professor Davies points out,
“breaking” constituted virtually any interference with the home, including
something as slight as “lifting up the latch.”80 If moving a latch was a search
requiring a warrant in colonial times, peering into a window could easily
have been considered one as well.
Substantiating that conjecture is the fact that civil lawsuits involving
voyeurs were heard in New England as early as the seventeenth century.81
Further, several American and English cases in the eighteenth century and
the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century permitted criminal prosecutions for
eavesdropping from a vantage point outside the home.82 Although techni-
cally these prosecutions focused on “listening toms” rather than “peeping
toms,” at least one of them involved a defendant who also “was proved
to have watched at the window of the chamber of the prosecutrix;” the
claim was upheld because “no man has a right . . . to pry into your secrecy
in your own house.”83 In any event, by the end of the nineteenth century,
civil and criminal trespass law in leading jurisdictions clearly prohibited
window peering.84 As one decision in 1897 opined, “we cannot conceive
of any conduct much more indecent and insulting than for a stranger to be
peeking into the windows of an occupied, lighted residence, and especially
at the hours of night when people usually retire.”85

More important, this notion retains viability today. At least twenty-ﬁve
states have statutes that criminalize looking into the home, under labels
such as “voyeurism,” “criminal surveillance,” “criminal trespass,” or simply
“disorderly conduct.”86 Convictions under such laws, some of them quite
recent, have often been based simply on evidence that the defendant was
seen peering into a window, with intent to invade privacy inferred from the
conduct.87 Tort case law similarly indicates that “spying into windows of a
home” can lead to compensable injury for invasion of privacy or the tort
of intrusion.88 These laws send the message that society is not prepared to
accept unjustiﬁed spying on a residence.
Most of the criminal laws prohibiting voyeurism require trespass as an
element of the offense.89 But some do not. For instance, in Louisiana a
peeping tom is deﬁned as “one who peeps through windows or doors, or
other like places, situated on or about the premises of another for the
purpose of spying upon or invading the privacy of persons spied upon
withouttheconsentofthepersonsspiedupon.”90Asthestatutethenmakes
clear, “it is not a necessary element of this offense that the ‘Peeping Tom’
be upon the premises of the person being spied upon.”91 At least ﬁve
other states have similar statutes,92 and several other jurisdictions construe
their laws to cover nontrespassory surveillance93 or deﬁne trespass very
loosely.94 Thus, in these states, naked eye viewing that does not involve
physical intrusion into constitutionally protected areas can be a crime.
Even in states that require clear proof of trespass for a peeping tom
violation, the kind of viewing Kyllo places outside the ambit of the Fourth
Amendment might be a crime because many courts refuse to designate
curtilage a “constitutionally protected area”95 (a stance with which at
least one member of the Supreme Court agrees).96 In these jurisdictions,
voyeurism by a person situated in the curtilage would not implicate the
Fourth Amendment as construed in Kyllo. But it would still be a crime
in trespass states, because curtilage is private property. Further, most of
the peeping tom statutes that require trespass do not contemplate the
possibility of home viewing using enhancement devices that obviate such
an intrusion; the one statute that clearly does (California’s) eliminates the
trespass element in this situation.97 This suggests that when states begin to
focus on surveillance using enhancement equipment, the trespass require-
ment will go by the wayside.
Finally, there is some empirical evidence suggesting that society con-
siders home surveillance using enhancement devices to be more intrusive
than the Supreme Court seems to think. In the study that I conducted with

Professor Schumacher (described in chapter 2), the responses of our 217
subjects, averaged together, provided a hierarchy of intrusiveness, ranging
from looking through foliage in a public park (R = 1) to a body cavity
search (R = 50).98 Most interesting for present purposes were the rank-
ings assigned to the two scenarios that most closely relate to the current
discussion—ﬂying four hundred yards above a backyard in a helicopter
(R = 10), and using binoculars to watch a person in a front yard (R =
33). The ﬂyover was ranked roughly the same as two scenarios involving
roadblocks (R = 9; R = 14), an action that the courts have held implicates
the Fourth Amendment and that sometimes requires individualized suspi-
cion.99 Even more relevant, the scenario involving binocular surveillance
of the front yard was ranked at roughly the same level of intrusiveness as
examination of a car trunk (R = 29), a footlocker in a car (R = 32), and
a garage (R = 37), all actions the courts consider to be searches requiring
probable cause.100 Although not included as a scenario in the study, the
use of binoculars to look into a house would likely have been ranked as
even more intrusive, and unenhanced spying on the home interior would
probably have also been ranked as fairly intrusive, at least at the same
level as binocular viewing of a front yard.
Thus, evidence from history, positive law, and social science casts signif-
icant doubt on Kyllo’s apparent conclusion that societal mores concerning
privacy are not transgressed by suspicionless home surveillance carried
out with devices that are in general public use or that can see what the
naked eye could see from a lawful vantage point. This conclusion, espe-
cially when combined with the inscrutability of the general use and naked
eye doctrines discussed earlier, argues for a different holding in Kyllo:
peering into the home by government ofﬁcials, at least when it relies on
enhancement devices, should always be considered a Fourth Amendment
search. The next section explores how this notion can be implemented.
III. Two Post-Kyllo Proposals
A rule that all technologically enhanced home surveillance is a search not
only reﬂects society’s expectations of privacy—whether deﬁned histori-
cally or by today’s standards—but also can be easily reconciled with the
language of the Fourth Amendment. As noted in chapter 2, to “search”
means “to look into or over carefully or thoroughly in an effort to ﬁnd
or discover something.” The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable

searches of houses. Thus, as many others have pointed out (and even Kyllo
intimated),101 it does not stretch the Fourth Amendment in the slightest to
say it is implicated when police look carefully or thoroughly for something
inside a house, even when doing so does not involve a physical trespass or
intrusion.
If that were the rule, then under current Fourth Amendment jurispru-
dence all governmental peering into houses—even naked eye viewing—
would require probable cause, as well as a warrant in nonexigent circum-
stances. The obvious protest against this interpretation is that it would
seriously hamper police investigation. Police with suspicion short of prob-
able cause to believe that criminal activity is taking place inside a home
would be unable to verify their suspicion through observation, either with
or without a warrant. Indeed, a cynic might claim that it is this concern, not
history or assessments of society’s privacy expectations, that best explains
Kyllo’s general public use and naked eye exceptions.
The regulatory approach proposed in chapter 2, however, would allow
police the beneﬁt of their observations, inadvertent and otherwise, without
sacriﬁcing individual privacy interests. Recall that under the proportional-
ity principle, although “search” is broadly construed under this proposal,
so too is “probable cause” (to mean “the cause that makes probable the
reasonableness of the intrusion occasioned by a given search or seizure”).
Thus deﬁned, peering into the home interior might not always require the
quantum of certainty associated with physical searches of the home. The
full implications of this notion are discussed below.
Also discussed below is a quite different way of addressing the prob-
lems raised by Kyllo, patterned on Title III’s prohibition of warrantless
electronic communications surveillance. Analogous legislation banning
particular forms of enhanced visual surveillance could in effect nullify
both the general public use and naked eye exceptions.
The Proportionality Principle and Home Surveillance
Here is the ﬁrst sentence of a twenty-ﬁrst-century news story: “When Sgt.
JohnShupewentlookingforaserialthieflastmonth,hepackedhiscarwith
the tools of his trade: a night-vision telescope, high-resolution binoculars, a
camcorder and a shotgun.”102 The story goes on to note that Shupe’s team
had carried out more than 400 surveillance operations in the past year,
which led to 127 arrests, although it does not describe how the various
enhancement devices Shupe carries were employed. If Shupe had used

any of these items to peer randomly into homes from his car, on the off
chance he would spy the serial thief, would he be violating the Fourth
Amendment?Verypossiblynot,afterKyllo.Thecamcorderandbinoculars
could easily be considered items that are in general public use, and the
scope might be as well. Even if they are not, any activities that Shupe sees
while using them that might also have been seen by the casual observer
on the sidewalk could well be covered by the naked eye exception. A ﬁnal
resolution of these matters would depend on which deﬁnition of general
public use is adopted and how easily naked eye viewing from a lawful
vantage could be hypothesized.
Now consider another story, this one a description of the pre-Kyllo case
of United States v. Wright.103 At 4:20 p.m., police located the chassis of a
stolen car under circumstances indicating that it had been stripped in that
vicinity. During a systematic sweep of the surrounding area, they found
nuts and bolts, as well as red rags similar to those found next to the car’s
carcass, in front of a three-car garage facing an alley. The sliding doors of
thegarage,althoughlocked,werenotcompletelyclosedbecauseoftheway
they were constructed and their age. Ofﬁcer Huffstutler shined a ﬂashlight
through the door gap to see the garage interior, where he observed parts
that had been removed from the stolen car. The majority held that use
of the ﬂashlight was not a search, while the dissent emphasized that the
garage doors were locked and stated, “certainly a ﬂashlight is not standard
equipment for ‘any curious passerby,’ particularly in the daytime.”104
The actions of Ofﬁcer Huffstutler, like Sergeant Shupe’s hypothesized
enhanced spying, are not easily characterized under Kyllo. On one hand,
if ﬂashlights are in general public use, which is the case under most deﬁni-
tions of that term, then the majority’s holding seems to be more consistent
with Kyllo. On the other hand, if one takes the empirical, general-use-for-
a-particular-purpose approach adopted by the dissent, then perhaps the
ofﬁcer’s actions did constitute a search. And there is even a third pos-
sibility: the inside of the garage was only “relatively dark” according to
the court (meaning the ﬂashlight was useful but not absolutely necessary),
and the ofﬁcer was kneeling on public property when he peered inside, so
perhaps the naked eye exception would apply here.
Under the proportionality approach, the analysis of Shupe’s and Huff-
stutler’s actions would be both easier and more coherent. First, Shupe’s
surveillance of home interiors and Huffstutler’s exploration of the garage
would clearly be searches, because in both cases police were looking for
evidence. Whether these searches were valid under the Fourth Amend-

ment would depend on the level of justiﬁcation and the level of intrusion.
If Shupe randomly peered into houses “looking for something,” then he
would be violating the Fourth Amendment, because his suspicion is too
minimal for even a slight intrusion into the home. The result would be
different, however, if he is merely using his binoculars or night scope to
scan rooftops, yards, and house exteriors for suspicious movement in a
neighborhood thought to be a target of the serial thief; further, if he spies
any such movement he should be able to focus on it long enough to as-
certain its nature, even if viewing inside a window is involved. Similarly,
Huffstutler’sobservationofthecarpartsandragsgavehimsufﬁcientcause,
even if not probable cause, for a brief look at the interior of a garage with
or without a ﬂashlight (although the exigency principle would still require
ex ante authorization for this act absent an emergency).
Under proportionality analysis, the ubiquity of the enhancement de-
vice the police use is irrelevant. So is any inquiry into whether the details
observed through enhancement could have been viewed with the naked
eye from a lawful vantage point. The only issues are the level of intrusion
visited by the police action and the level of justiﬁcation for it.
The two signiﬁcant advantages of this approach should be apparent.
First, it avoids the complications associated with the general public use
and naked eye doctrines. Second, as pointed out in chapter 2, it avoids the
strains placed on courts and the police by the rigid probable-cause-forever
precept. Under the monolithic approach, courts are encouraged, as the
majority was in Wright, to declare searches to be nonsearches. That result
leaves a huge range of intrusive police actions completely unregulated by
the Fourth Amendment, including, most probably, use of ﬂashlights and
binoculars to look inside homes. At the same time, under current rules no
search, even a relatively unintrusive one, can take place unless police have
full-blown probable cause. That result runs counter to legal reasoning in
a number of other constitutional and nonconstitutional domains, where
the required justiﬁcation need be proportionate only to the impact of the
government intervention.
The usual criticism of the proportionality idea—that it converts the
Fourth Amendment into “one immense Rorschach blot,” to use Professor
Amsterdam’s phrase—was also countered in chapter 2. The only riposte
that will be repeated here is the observation that, whatever they may say
they are doing, courts routinely apply proportionality reasoning, even in
connection with home searches. Consider ﬁrst the Supreme Court’s other
enhancement device case involving the home, United States v. Karo.105

There the Court held that use of a beeper to detect movement inside a
house is a search, but also indicated that a “court order” authorizing such
a search might be valid even if based on reasonable suspicion rather than
probable cause. Although not provided by the Court, the rationale for
allowing a lower level of suspicion could easily be that a beeper does not
reveal the detail that direct visual observation does. As Kyllo held, the pre-
cise capacity of the device used is not relevant to whether a search occurs
when the target is a house interior, but it might help deﬁne the level of
justiﬁcation necessary for such a search under proportionality analysis.106
The lower courts also routinely engage in proportionality analysis when
analyzing home surveillance. For instance, in Wright, the majority gave as
an alternative ground for its holding the fact that although the police may
not have had probable cause, they had developed sufﬁcient cause to look
into a garage.107 Similar holdings are found or implied in a number of other
decisions.108
Kyllo does not necessarily reject the proportionality approach in the
context of enhanced home surveillance. Both the general public use and
naked eye doctrines could be characterized as dicta.109 Or both doctrines
might be deﬁned so narrowly that they have no practical impact. For in-
stance, if general public use were deﬁned to apply only to technology used
by the entire population to carry out the type of observation in question,
it would have no application in connection with home surveillance. If the
naked eye doctrine were deﬁned to require clear proof that all the activities
and items seen with the enhancement device could also have been seen
with the naked eye from a public vantage point (e.g., sidewalks, but not
curtilage or other areas abutting the home), then it too would have little
purchase.
At the same time, following the suggestion in Karo, searches of houses
(enhanced or not) that by their nature are not particularly intrusive could
be justiﬁed on something less than probable cause as traditionally deﬁned.
In this regard it is fruitful to revisit the explicit Kyllo holding. The primi-
tive thermal imager in that case detected only heat waves and could not
tell the police the source of the temperature differential they observed;
other information was necessary to convince them that the heat escaping
from Kyllo’s house came from halide lights used to grow marijuana.110 It
is true, as the majority pointed out, that thermal imaging, along with other
information, might also tell government ofﬁcials when the occupants are
cooking or the “hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna
and bath”;111 thus, one should conclude, as Scalia did for the majority, that

“in the home . . . all details are intimate details” and that use of the imager
was a search. But that conclusion does not necessarily dictate that probable
cause is needed to use devices that detect only heat waves and do not reveal
their source.112
Thesameapproachcouldbetakenwithrespecttotechnologicalsearches
of persons and effects, two of the other three categories mentioned in the
Fourth Amendment (the fourth category—papers—is the topic of chapters
6 and 7). The technology most relevant here is the type of detection device,
described in chapter 1, that permits police to see “through” clothing and
opaque containers. Generally probable cause should be required to use
this type of device. Not only has the Court typically treated persons and
effects as protectively as it has houses,113 but the general public use and
naked eye exceptions are unlikely to apply where persons and effects are
involved, given the sophistication of the technology and the opaqueness
of the targets.
However, both the Court’s case law and proportionality analysis might
dictate a different result for certain types of detection devices. To the extent
a device detects only contraband (such as drugs or explosives) or only
weapons (in jurisdictions where weapons concealment is a crime), then
the Court has intimated that the Fourth Amendment does not apply. For
instance, Place v. United States held that a dog sniff of luggage is not a
search,inpartontheassumptionthatthedogrespondsonlytothepresence
of drugs,114 and Jacobsen v. United States concluded that a test that detects
only the presence of cocaine does not implicate the Fourth Amendment
because it compromises “no legitimate interest.”115 Assuming that use of
a detection device (1) does not require a seizure or is used only after a
legitimate seizure, (2) does not harm the person or the contents of the
container involved, and (3) is truly contraband speciﬁc or weapon speciﬁc,
proportionality analysis might in effect reach the same conclusion, on the
ground that, although a search, such an intrusion is trivial.
A Legislative Approach
As noted in chapter 1, federal legislation has regulated electronic com-
munications surveillance since 1968, when Congress passed the Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, which most courts designate simply
Title III.116 Similar federal legislation regulating enhanced visual surveil-
lance—a sort of national “peeping techno-tom” law—might have much

proportionality approach. Consider the following description of how Title
III might serve as a model for that purpose.
Title III deals with interception of oral, wire, and electronic communi-
cations, but for present purposes the provisions regarding oral communica-
tion are most pertinent. Title III deﬁnes the latter type of communication
as “any oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expecta-
tion that such communication is not subject to interception under circum-
stances justifying such expectation”117 and deﬁnes “intercept” to mean
“the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any . . . oral communi-
cation through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.”118
It then prohibits all “intentional” interceptions of oral communications,
so deﬁned, unless they are judicially authorized or one of the parties to
the communication consents to the interception.119 Violations can lead not
only to exclusion of evidence but to civil and criminal penalties.120
One important effect of these provisions is that they criminalize all
nonconsensual electronic eavesdropping by civilians. Other parts of Title
III reinforce this prohibition by banning the manufacture and sale of “any
electronic, mechanical, or other device [that is] primarily useful for the pur-
pose of the surreptitious interception of . . . oral . . . communications.”121
Although ordinary interception devices such as tape recorders are not
covered by this provision, hidden recorders or microphones may be.122
With important modiﬁcations, these provisions can be applied in the vi-
sual surveillance context. First, just as unauthorized interceptions of oral
communications are prohibited, the proposed statute would ban noncon-
sensual, warrantless “visual surveillance” of “private locations.”123 The lat-
ter term could be deﬁned as “the interior of the home and all other areas
in which activities are carried out or items possessed by people exhibiting
an expectation that such activities or items are not subject to surveillance
under circumstances justifying such an expectation.” This deﬁnition would
encompass car trunks, luggage, and areas underneath clothing as well as
homes. “Visual surveillance” could be deﬁned as “the viewing of activities
or items in a private location using any electronic, mechanical, or other
device.” If that deﬁnition is viewed as too broad (it would include viewing
private locations with eyeglasses as well as with cameras, thermal imagers,
and detection devices, for instance), the phrase “that enhances normal
(20/20) vision” could be appended to it. Any intentional visual surveil-
lance, so deﬁned, would be prohibited unless judicially authorized or at
least one of the parties under surveillance consents to it.
Anotheraspect of the proposed statutewould, like Title III, seek to limit

the proliferation of surveillance devices. Unauthorized manufacture, sale,
or possession of visual surveillance equipment that is “primarily useful for
the purpose of the surreptitious visual surveillance of private locations”
could be prohibited. Devices that could see images through walls and video
cameras that are designed to be secreted in briefcases and clothing clearly
fall in this category, while ﬂashlights, binoculars, night scopes, and tele-
scopes clearly do not. Devices such as thermal imagers and beepers are
less easily categorized. Perhaps with respect to these types of devices, leg-
islation could place limitations on their purchase and possession similar to
those that exist with surreptitious listening devices.124
Because it bans warrantless, nonconsensual technological surveillance
of “private locations,” deﬁned to include the interior of residences, this
statute should render virtually irrelevant both the general public use and
naked eye exceptions to the extent they allow suspicionless, covert tech-
nological surveillance of the home. In this regard it is worth noting that
analogous exceptions under Title III have been rejected. For instance,
although Congress amended Title III in 1986 to remove protection for
conversations on cordless phones on the theory that they could be in-
tercepted using “readily available technologies” such as an AM radio,125
eight years later it reversed itself,126 presumably for reasons similar to
those advanced here against the general public use exception in visual
surveillance cases. Courts have also found that electronically monitoring
conversations that take place in private places violates Title III even when
the conversations could also have been heard from an adjacent public
area without eavesdropping equipment.127 Parallel reasoning in the visual
surveillance context would make the naked eye exception untenable. In
other words, under Title III privacy does not disappear simply because the
technology used to conduct surveillance is generally available or picks up
conversations in private areas that could be heard with the naked ear.
The proposed statute would not, of course, “reverse” the part of Kyllo
that adopts the general public use and naked eye exceptions, because they
are interpretations of the Constitution. As a consequence, if the statute
did not provide for an exclusionary remedy (such as occurs under Title III
with respect to computer communications, for instance),128 then evidence
obtained when these exceptions apply, although observed in violation of
the statute, could still be used in court. But even in this situation the statute
would have an impact. Because the statute would prohibit covert civil-
ian use of any technology—including commonly available devices such as
ﬂashlights and binoculars—to spy into homes, courts would be hard put

to ﬁnd that such items are in general public use for that purpose, whether
they consider the issue empirically or as a matter of positive law. That po-
sition, in turn, should nullify Kyllo’s general public use exception (unless
the Court insists on deﬁning the exception in terms of general use for any
purpose). Moreover, because the statute would prohibit civilian purchase
and possession of technology made primarily for covert spying of private
locations, that type of technology would never become “generally used.”
The statute’s effect on Kyllo’s naked eye exception would be more am-
biguous. Although Congress could perhaps pass a national peeping tom
statute,129 the proposed legislation does not directly regulate unenhanced
observation of home interiors. Thus, under the reasoning of Kyllo, the
government might still be able to avail itself of the naked eye exception
when its technological surveillance discerns only what such viewing would
discern. However, courts might ﬁnd that enhanced viewing of activities
that would also have been visible to a naked eye observer are nonetheless,
under the statute, “carried out . . . by people exhibiting an expectation
that such activities . . . are not subject to surveillance under circumstances
justifying such an expectation.” If so, the naked eye exception would lose
any moral force it might otherwise have had.
Conclusion
The drafters of the Fourth Amendment believed the house should be
sacrosanct. Kyllo leaves that fundamental principle in doubt. Its general
public use and naked eye exceptions to the general prohibition against
enhanced visual observation of the home interior represent potentially
huge loopholes in the Fourth Amendment’s protection. Unless very nar-
rowly deﬁned, they are difﬁcult to apply. More important, they would allow
police to violate our reasonable expectations of privacy, whether deﬁned
by what we knowingly expose to the public, by history, by positive law, or
by empirical investigation of societal mores.
The better approach is to designate all house surveillance a search, but
modulate the cause necessary to carry it out. At the same time, the leg-
islature should outlaw unauthorized use of technology to view the home,
thereby ensuring that it never becomes routine. Otherwise, our most pri-
vate sanctuary will become progressively less private.

Public Privacy: Surveillance of Public
Places and the Right to Anonymity
In London, police say that every worker or shopper is caught on at least 300 cameras every
day. — The Straits Times (Singapore) (2001)
[In the United States] there are 29 million cameras videotaping people at airports, government
buildings, ofﬁces, schools, stores and elsewhere, according to one widely cited estimate in the
security industry. — Wall Street Journal (2004)
There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given mo-
ment. — George Orwell, 1984 (1949)
If . . . dragnet type law enforcement practices should eventually occur, there will be time
enough then to determine whether different constitutional principles may be applicable.
— United States v. Knotts (1983)
T
he advent of sophisticated technology that allows the government to
watch, zoom in on, track, and record the activities of anyone, any-
where in public, twenty-four hours a day, demands regulation. Yet to date
no meaningful constraints on this type of surveillance exist. The constant
drumbeat of the “war on crime,” louder than ever since the terrorist at-
tack on September 11, 2001, has drowned out calls for greater control
over technological surveillance of the streets. This chapter argues that
the Fourth Amendment requires courts to regulate such surveillance—
in particular, camera surveillance of public activity—if the legislative and
executive branches are unwilling to do so.
The primary obstacle to this agenda is the United States Supreme Court
decision in United States v. Knotts,1 which considered the Fourth Amend-
ment’s application to the practice of tracking a car’s movements with an
electronic beeper. There the Court held that “a person traveling in an auto-
mobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy

in his movements from one place to another.”2 Even more signiﬁcant, it
concluded that the fact that such movements might be detected through
use of a beeper rather than via visual surveillance “does not alter the
situation.”3 If the Fourth Amendment is not implicated by technological
surveillance of a car traveling on public thoroughfares, it is unlikely to
apply to enhanced surveillance of a person walking the streets.
As the portion of Knotts highlighted at the outset of this chapter indi-
cates, however, the Court did broach a caveat to its conclusion—perhaps
a tiny one, but nonetheless one that is very pertinent today. Knotts had
argued that beeper tracking should be considered a Fourth Amendment
search because otherwise “twenty-four hour surveillance of any citizen of
this country will be possible, without judicial knowledge or supervision.”4
Although the Court considered this observation irrelevant to the case at
hand, where the beeper had been used merely to relocate the receptacle
in which it had been placed after police lost visual contact,5 the Court also
acknowledged that the type of “dragnet” practices conjectured by Knotts
might raise constitutional issues.6
That concession is important because in many urban and even some
suburban areas today, full-time technological surveillance of the public is
the norm. While tracking devices comprise one aspect of this surveillance,
it is cameras, positioned on buildings and telephone poles, that pose the
bigger threat in this regard. The traditionally grainy video image, accessi-
ble at the time it is captured only by the camera operator, is rapidly being
replaced by digital technology that produces top-quality images available
in real time to police and to others at remote locations, including command
centers and patrol cars. Digitization allows much easier long-term storage
than bulky videotape, thereby increasing the potential that images will
be around longer and viewed by more people, and it also makes possi-
ble identiﬁcation of those captured on camera through computer-based
matching programs that use biometric technology.7 Most important, the
vast expansion of camera networks, most advanced in the United Kingdom
but occurring in parts of this country as well, means that twenty-four-hour
monitoring of public activities is now possible in many urban areas. Drag-
net surveillance is upon us.
The Court’s unwillingness in Knotts to announce deﬁnitively that all
public surveillance is unregulated by the Constitution may reﬂect an in-
tuition that at some point this type of surveillance amounts to a serious
infringement of reasonable expectations of privacy. If so, the Court’s hes-
itancy in implementing this intuition probably stems not only from tradi-

public privacy

tional judicial parsimony but also from the Court’s perplexity over how
one can possess “privacy” in public. When one’s every movement is read-
ily observable by others, how can one expect constitutional protection of
those movements?
This chapter answers that question from a number of perspectives,
summed up in the notion that we all possess a right to anonymity, even
in public. Continuous, repeated, or recorded government surveillance of
innocent public activities that are not meant for public consumption is nei-
ther expected nor to be condoned, for it ignores the fundamental fact that
we express private thoughts through conduct as well as through words. The
Fourth Amendment should be construed to recognize the right to public
anonymity as a part of the privacy expectations that, to use the Supreme
Court’s expression, “society is prepared to recognize as ‘reasonable.’ ”
The ﬁrst section of this chapter sets the stage for this argument by
describing in more detail the extent of camera surveillance and the deﬁ-
ciencies in the way legislatures and courts have reacted to it. The second
and third sections develop the basis for the right to public anonymity. They
draw from a number of different commentators and court decisions, as well
as from an empirical study that demonstrates the extent to which ordinary
citizens value the ability to walk and drive the streets without having to
contend with constant technological monitoring. Chapter 5 then explores
the implications of the right to anonymity.
I. Camera Surveillance of the Public Now and in the Near Future
The government uses cameras to watch us in all sorts of venues, ranging
from private stores to public restrooms, from government-owned buildings
to public streets, from trafﬁc intersections and parking lots to trafﬁc stops
by state troopers. This book will focus on government camera surveillance
of pedestrians in public streets, as distinguished from video monitoring of
building interiors and motorist stops. Thus, this chapter’s use of the phrase
“public camera surveillance” and its commonly accepted abbreviation,
“CCTV”—for closed-circuit television—will refer only to surveillance of
public streets, parks, and the like. Even when deﬁned in this narrow sense,
public surveillance using camera technology is increasing at an exponen-
tial rate. As in other areas of technological development, the law has not
kept up.

The Surveillance Dragnet
The future has arrived in Washington, D.C., in the wake of the terrorist
attacks of September 11. Hundreds of government cameras are trained
on streets, subways, school hallways, and federal facilities, in a project
that “makes Washington the ﬁrst U.S. city to be able to peer across wide
stretches of the city and to create a digital record of images.”8 State-of-the-
art cameras allow operators to take advantage of “satellite-based optics”
that enable them to see in the dark, capture words on a printed page
from hundreds of feet away, and peer into buildings. Numerous private
cameras are also added into the mix. In 2002, the head of the project
stated, “I don’t think there’s really a limit on the feeds [the system] can
take”; further, he noted that the system has the “capability to tap into
not only video but databases and systems across the region”9 and could
expand into schools, businesses, and suburban neighborhoods.10 All this is
accomplished through a $7 million central control facility, which relays the
feeds to nearly one thousand squad cars.11
Washington’s cameras are supposedly activated only during major
events and emergencies, and recordings are kept for only ten days. But
pressure is building to monitor the devices 24/7.12 And other cities, bol-
stered by tens of millions of federal dollars, are not so hesitant about using
their cameras. By the end of 2006 Chicago had networked more than 2,200
video cameras—at a cost of more than $8 million in federal and municipal
funds—that are turned on night and day, every day of the week. Many of
the cameras are hidden, and all are patched into the city’s $43 million oper-
ations center, so that a dispatcher can send video images from the camera
located closest to the scene of a reported incident.13 Baltimore’s system
is also running continuously and is linked to cameras in four surrounding
counties.14
The camera systems in Washington, Chicago, and Baltimore are among
the most extensive and sophisticated, but many other American cities have
installed camera complexes that are far from antiquated. For instance,
Newark, Tampa, Virginia Beach, and Memphis all have cameras, rang-
ing in number from six to seventy-two, that cover large areas of public
real estate and that can rotate 360 degrees, pan and tilt, and zoom in on
subjects.15 In 2001, Tampa added several dozen cameras equipped with
face recognition technology that purportedly matched captured faces with
criminal arrest records (although the city discontinued the program when
it failed to produce any arrests).16

Many smaller cities and towns are following suit in one way or another.
Cicero, Illinois (population 83,000), Newport, Rhode Island (86,000), and
St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana (66,000), have each spent well over $100,000
installing camera systems since 2004.17 A 2001 study by the International
Association of Chiefs of Police found that 80 percent of the 207 responding
American law enforcement agencies have deployed some sort of closed-
circuit television and that another 10 percent will soon do so.18 Much of this
technology is “in-car” video designed to record police detention activities,
or is placed at trafﬁc intersections or in government buildings. But about
half the agencies surveyed in the study use cameras in high crime areas, 25
percent use them on streets, and 15 percent use them in parks.19 Even small
towns have set up cameras for this purpose. An informal survey conducted
in 2006 found that seventeen small police departments (with fewer than
one hundred ofﬁcers) have a surveillance system or plan to establish one
soon.20 It should also be noted that some trafﬁc camera networks, although
primarily designed to photograph the license plates of speeders, can peer
inside a vehicle, at areas outside the intersection, and even into homes and
ofﬁces alongside the targeted thoroughfares.21
All these cameras are owned by the government, although in some
locales they are operated by “volunteers” from the community.22 In the
private sphere, camera use is even more widespread. A nationwide survey
of a variety of companies, taken more than ten years ago, found that 75
percent use CCTV surveillance.23 That fact becomes important even if the
focus is solely state action, given the above-mentioned capacity to link
these cameras to government command centers.
When it comes to government-operated camera surveillance, however,
the United States can’t hold a candle to the United Kingdom, the champion
of CCTV. Well over eight hundred public video surveillance programs
operate locally in the United Kingdom, involving between three and four
million cameras and creating more video images per capita than any other
country in the world.24 Between 200,000 and 400,000 of these cameras
monitor public areas;25 many are equipped with zoom lenses that can read
the wording on a cigarette packet at one hundred yards and bring nighttime
images up to daylight level.26 And the installation of cameras is likely to
continue unabated. Researcher Clive Norris concludes that “in the ﬁrst
decade of the new millennium, when average Britons leave their homes
what will be remarkable is if their presence is not seen, their behavior
not monitored and their movements not recorded by the omni-presence
of the cameras, CCTV operators, and video recorders.”27 Most of these

programs are jointly operated and managed by law enforcement and the
private sector. Almost all are linked to police stations, but quite a few
are also monitored by private security guards.28 Many other European
countries have similar systems.29
Today, these cameras are operated primarily by people. But the camera
systems of the not-so-distant future will be much more automated. Motion
detection systems will be able to discern when movements are out of the
ordinary and then alert human assessors, who are thereby spared sifting
through mountains of data.30 License plate recognition systems, already in
operation in London and some other parts of the United Kingdom, will
be able to identify cars that enter unauthorized areas or that move in the
wrong direction, and automatically keep track of every car’s movement.31
Facial and “swagger” recognition systems, more sophisticated than the one
used in Tampa, will trigger a signal when people with criminal records,
outstanding warrants, or lack of authorization are spotted.32 There is no
technological reason why cameras could not also be equipped with “see-
through” technology that can detect when an individual is carrying a gun.
The Efﬁcacy of CCTV
The huge investment in CCTV technology here and abroad is based on two
premises. The ﬁrst assumption, of course, is that it enhances public safety.
The second is that it does so less expensively than any equally effective
alternative. Both premises are subject to some doubt.
Reports abound of prodigious camera-induced drops in street crimes, in
the 50–70 percent range.33 But these accounts are of questionable accuracy,
at least when they purport to describe crime reduction caused by street-
based CCTV.34 One commentary on the reports about the United King-
dom’sCCTVsystemdescribestheglowingstatisticsas“posthocshoestring
efforts by the untrained and self-interested practitioner.”35 More neutral
analysis of the efﬁcacy of public surveillance paints a different picture.
A meta-review of thirteen of the better-conducted studies carried out in
the United Kingdom through 2000 concluded that “the criminological ev-
idence as to CCTV’s effectiveness in reducing crime does not support
the almost exponential increase in cameras on British streets as a crime
prevention measure.”36 An even more recent meta-analysis of the twenty-
two most carefully conducted studies in the United Kingdom and North
America indicated that while half of the studies found a “desirable effect
on crime,” ﬁve found an “undesirable” effect, and six found no effect or

an uncertain effect on crime; ultimately, “the average overall reduction in
crime wasa rather small four per cent.”37 Similarly, a multisite study of cam-
era surveillance in Australia completed in 2006 found that CCTV had “no
signiﬁcant impact” on crime rates, whether the crimes were against person
or property, although it also concluded that CCTV might be “effective at
detecting violent offending and/or may result in increased reporting” of
such activity.38
A more speciﬁc example of such research comes from Glasgow, one of
the ﬁrst major cities to adopt CCTV. There, a three-year study conducted
by criminologists found that although crime was reduced in “certain cate-
gories, . . . there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had reduced
crime overall,” and “the cameras appeared to have little effect on clear
up rates for crimes and offences.”39 Glasgow citizens also reported feel-
ing less safe in the city center, perhaps because the cameras generated
publicity about crime in downtown areas.40 Anecdotal statistics from the
more recent past are equally disappointing. In London, where cameras
abound, even street robberies—the crime CCTV is supposed to be best at
deterring—increased in 2002.41 In Sydney, a relatively new camera system
produced only one arrest every 160 days.42
American cities have had similar experiences. Early systems set up
in ﬁve cities—Hoboken, New Jersey; Mount Vernon, New York; Miami;
Charleston; and Detroit—were discontinued because they were not cost
effective.43 In the mid-1990s, cameras in Times Square were dismantled af-
ter producing fewer than ten arrests in twenty-two months.44 These failures
might be attributed, at least in part, to the primitiveness of the technology
used. However, Oakland, California, more recently ended its three-year
experiment using high-deﬁnition cameras—able to read a ﬂyer hundreds
of yards away and a license plate more than a mile away—because it had no
“conclusive way to establish that the presence of video surveillance cam-
eras resulted in the prevention or reduction of crime.”45 As of March 2006,
the worst offense captured on Washington, D.C.’s sophisticated camera
system was a car break-in, and that was in 2001.46 “Mostly people drinking
beer in public, or popping pills” is how one camera monitor describes the
criminal incidents viewed by cameras in Baltimore.47
There are many reasons why cameras might not be effective at reducing
crime in the areas on which they are trained. Consider the three ways
cameras can, in theory, be useful: (1) they might help spot incipient crime

perpetrators at some later time; and (3) they might deter crime. In each of
these three areas, obstacles to smooth functioning exist.
The ability of cameras to help nab perpetrators at the time of their
crime or prevent crime by those about to carry it out is circumscribed by a
number of factors. Camera operators may not observe the conduct because
the cameras have been destroyed or tampered with (as one detective said,
gang members “break them, . . . turn them . . . shoot them up.”).48 Bad
lighting or obstacles also often prevent good viewing; one British ofﬁcial
admitted, for instance, that despite all the cameras in his country, “there
are hundreds of thousands of nooks and crannies left” and that criminals
“target[ ] luxury cars on the move so that any view the cameras gets of
them is ﬂeeting at best” or conceal “their street muggings by grabbing their
targets in a clinch that, on CCTV, looks like nothing more than a romantic
hug.”49 Even when an event is in full view, it may not be observed; operators
getdistractedorbored,oraresimplyunabletorecognizewhatishappening
in ambiguous situations.50 If operators do see something suspicious, their
distance from the scene sometimes makes them overcautious in concluding
a crime is occurring.51 And even when incipient crime is clearly identiﬁed,
police will not necessarily be deployed. A dearth of sufﬁciently proximate
ofﬁcers (created in part by the belief that fewer police are needed when
cameras are present),52 lack of or poor communication between the control
room and those in the street,53 and even police fear of being caught on
camera and having their actions misinterpreted can limit law enforcement
response.54 All these problems have their analogs in systems that are more
fully automated. Alarms may not sound because of technological ﬂaws,55
or deployments may not occur because of human ones.
Attempts to memorialize the crime and the perpetrator on tape can
also run into difﬁculty. Sometimes tapes are destroyed before authori-
ties realize they may be helpful in solving crime.56 Nor does retention
of the tapes guarantee identiﬁcation. Recordings are sometimes of poor
quality57 (although, as noted earlier, digitalization has gone a long way
toward rectifying this problem), images caught on tape are always subject
to interpretation (think of the Rodney King video),58 and perpetrators are
hard to identify even with good images (with some research ﬁnding that
matching unfamiliar faces is “highly error-prone” even when carried out
by experienced law enforcement agents).59 Even if tapes are preserved and
human error is set aside, obtaining the relevant frames can consume days
of effort by the police.60
Finally, cameras cannot be effective deterrents if their presence is not

made known, which apparently is often the case.61 And even when the
cameras’ presence is conspicuous, certain types of offenders are too pre-
occupied or dense to notice, or are oblivious (as with rowdy revelers)62
or uncaring (as with nighttime prowlers who wear masks, wigs, or other
disguises).63 A 1995 study reported that criminals believe the presence of
cameras is the least of their concerns in considering whether to rob busi-
nesses.64 Also of note is the unintended consequence of reducing surveil-
lance by citizens, who assume that the cameras will do the job.65
Findings that crime has dropped in areas exposed to cameras must also
be tempered by two facts. In some studies, part of the crime reduction was
undoubtedly a result of other factors, including additional crime control
measures undertaken at the time the cameras were installed and decreas-
ing crime rates overall.66 Second, many of these studies did not take into
account the possibility that any crime that surveillance does deter is simply
pushed into an area that does not have cameras.67
These observations should not lead to the conclusion that public video
surveillance has little or no impact on crime. For instance, cameras made
identiﬁcation of those who carried out the London bombings of July 7,
2005, much easier, although they did not, of course, prevent the carnage.68
And although law enforcement statistics are probably inﬂated (on those
few occasions when they exist),69 it must be acknowledged that even more
careful, privately conducted studies indicate that some cities experience
a noticeable reduction in offense rates after camera installation. For in-
stance, the town center of Airdrie, Scotland, experienced a 21 percent drop
in crime over the two-year period after cameras were set up, with no ob-
vious evidence of displacement and after factoring out other explanatory
variables such as a drop in overall crime rates.70 Newcastle experienced
signiﬁcant drops in particular crimes: 35 percent in criminal damage, 50
percent in motor vehicle theft, and 56 percent in burglary, compared to 25
percent, 39 percent, and 39 percent reductions for the same crimes in the
control areas.71 A third United Kingdom study found a 25 percent drop
in crime sustained over a two-year period, with no displacement effects.72
Although these ﬁgures are signiﬁcantly lower than initial law enforcement
claims,73 they are nonetheless impressive.
When all the data are looked at closely, a fair conclusion is that well-
positioned, sophisticated cameras run by competent staff might be able
to reduce some types of street crime, particularly theft, by 10–25 percent
in high crime areas, compared to similar public areas that have no cam-
eras, with only a small displacement effect.74 As noted earlier, the second

question that must be answered by careful policymakers is whether this
reduction is cost-effective. Could other alternatives, such as more patrols,
better lighting, and greater community participation in law enforcement,
achieve equal or better results at less cost?
That question will not be answered deﬁnitively here. Some information
about the cost of CCTV can provide a useful starting point, however. In
the United Kingdom, a number of local authorities have yearly operating
budgets of well over $500,000 for camera systems that cover downtown
areas.75 The annual budget of each of the several hundred-camera systems
in New York City housing projects in 2001 was approximately $850,000
just for stafﬁng (i.e., not including the upfront costs of the cameras, their
maintenance, new tapes, tape storage, and associated expenditures).76
Whether equally effective alternatives would be cheaper is harder to
calculate.77 But it can be noted that even a relatively successful CCTV sys-
tem may not pay for itself. One study indicated that although good CCTV
systems can make signiﬁcant dents in shoplifting, the value of merchandise
retained would not equal expenditures on such a system for nearly ﬁve
years;78 as one researcher noted, “it might be more rational to just accept
the losses.”79 Where violent crime is concerned, that kind of reasoning
is less palatable, and expensive surveillance systems might be endorsed
if even a few such crimes would be prevented or detected.80 Unfortu-
nately, however, violent crimes are probably the most difﬁcult offenses for
cameras to prevent or deter, given the often spontaneous nature of the
crimes.81 Several studies from the United Kingdom suggest that putting
more ofﬁcers on the streets is at least as effective as a camera system.82
In sum, it is not clear that public camera surveillance is always a worth-
while investment from a public safety perspective. That conclusion is un-
likely to slow the continued proliferation of such surveillance, however.
“Common sense” judgments, which view the efﬁcacy of camera systems as
a foregone conclusion, are likely to dominate any debate on the matter.83
Politicians will continue to point to cameras as a “silver bullet” method of
crime prevention.84 Recent terrorist attacks here and in Europe will only
add to the pressure to provide protection through surveillance.85 Although,
as noted above, some cities have terminated CCTV programs that have
failed to reduce crime, there is also the possibility that once the newer,
more expensive systems are set up, inertia will prevent their disassembly
even in the face of proven ineffectiveness. The primary question is not
whether such systems will be installed or maintained, but whether and
how their use will be regulated.

Current Legal Regulation of Public Camera Surveillance
Meaningful legal strictures on government use of public surveillance cam-
erasinGreatBritain,Canada,andtheUnitedStatesarenonexistent.Great
Britain’s Code of Practice sets out operating standards “but has no mech-
anism for accountability or enforcement.”86 Similarly, while governments
in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta, Canada, have adopted very
extensive guidelines governing camera and tape use, storage, training, and
the like—all of which are framed in terms of what governments “must”
or “should” do—ultimately they are merely precatory; no administrative,
civil, or criminal sanctions attach if they are breached.87 A few American
cities have adopted these types of nonbinding rules as well, again none
of them enforceable in court or through a citizen-driven grievance pro-
cedure.88 In a 2000 meeting of the International Association of Chiefs of
Police, relatively comprehensive model rules were drafted, but the premise
of the meeting was that “voluntary guidelines” are sufﬁcient.89 A majority
of jurisdictions don’t even have those.90
AnumberofAmericanjurisdictionsdocriminalizenonconsensualvideo
surveillance of certain types of activities, but these provisions will rarely
implicate government use of public cameras. Arizona’s statute is typical.
It classiﬁes as a misdemeanor the ﬁlming or recording, without consent, of
any person who is “urinating, defecating, dressing, undressing, nude or in-
volved in sexual intercourse or sexual contact” in a bedroom or bathroom
or any other area “where the person has a reasonable expectation of pri-
vacy.”91 Given its predicate examples (bedroom, bathroom), surveillance
of most public areas is unlikely to be covered by this law. Several states
do prohibit viewing “intimate” or “personal” areas (e.g., under a woman’s
dress) in a public space.92 But none purport to regulate other types of video
surveillance in public.93
A principal reason for the virtually unanimous resistance to a tougher
stance on public video surveillance in the United States is the assumption
that courts are not likely to ﬁnd it inimical to the Constitution or any other
established body of law. For reasons developed in the previous chapter,
video surveillance of the home interior and similar areas is probably gov-
erned by the Fourth Amendment.94 But all courts that have considered
application of the Fourth Amendment to cameras aimed at public streets
or other areas frequented by a large number of people have declared that
such surveillance is not a search, on the ground that any expectation of
privacy one might have in these areas is unreasonable.95 A few courts have

noted that particularly intrusive public surveillance might implicate the
Fourth Amendment, but all have shied away from so holding.96 Similarly,
some courts have held that Title III, which governs electronic eavesdrop-
ping, applies (with some modiﬁcations) to video surveillance of the home
and similarly private locations,97 but none has held that it also applies to
surveillance of public activities.
It is worth noting that no court has considered a Fourth Amendment
challenge to a CCTV system, and that most of the decisions holding that
the Fourth Amendment does not apply to shorter-term, spot surveillance
have involved covert rather than overt camera use. But the bottom line is
that legislatures have not enacted meaningful regulation of public video
surveillance by the government, and the courts have been unwilling to
nudge them in that direction. That should change.
II. The Right to Public Anonymity
Suppose that the local police in a particular jurisdiction were to decide to station
a police car at the entrance to the parking lot of a well-patronized bar from 5:30
p.m. to 7:30 p.m. every business day for the purpose of making a list of the license
plates of cars that were driven in and parked in the lot during that time. . . . If we
assume that the bar has the necessary liquor license to sell drinks, that nothing
more is known about the individuals patronizing the bar than that they happen
to drive into its parking lot at this hour, and that there are no other special
circumstances present, I would guess that the great majority of people who
might have the question posed to them would say that this is not a proper police
function. . . . There would be an uneasiness, and I think a justiﬁed uneasiness,
if those who patronized the bar felt that their names were being taken down
and ﬁled for future reference. . . . This ought not to be a governmental function
when the facts are as extreme as I put them.98
These words were written by William Rehnquist, not long after he was
appointed to the United States Supreme Court in 1972. He was right that
overt police monitoring of the comings and goings of individuals for no
apparent reason is not an appropriate government function; as he stated
later in his article, the “interest in not having public activities observed and
recorded may prevail in the absence of any governmental justiﬁcation for
the surveillance.”99 The only thing wrong about the passage set out above
is that the hypothesized facts are not “extreme.” They describe a practice

that would be quite feasible and even routine with any video surveillance
system that openly records public activity.
Rehnquist also asserted that the individual interest involved in this
situation, although deserving of protection, is not “privacy,” because the
observed action “is not intended to be concealed or conﬁdential and is
not in fact concealed or conﬁdential.”100 It is true that no particular trip
to the bar is concealed. But it is also true that those who make trips to
the bar think that their observers either will not know or care who they
are, or will be acquaintances or other bar patrons readily distinguishable
from impersonal government observers bent on collecting information.
Those who patronize bars or any other establishment both expect, and
normally can count on, concealment from the latter type of observation.
If the “uneasy” reaction to which Rehnquist refers is not based on a sense
of privacy invasion, it stems from something very close to it—a sense that
one has what I call a right to public anonymity.
Anonymityisthestateofbeingunnamed.101Therighttopublicanonym-
ity is the assurance that, when in public, one is presumptively nameless—
unremarked, part of the undifferentiated crowd—as far as the govern-
ment is concerned. The right is surrendered only when one does or says
something that merits government attention, which most of the time must
be something suggestive of criminal activity, although it might involve a
noncriminal emergency or accident.
The association of public anonymity with privacy is not new. In his
seminal study of privacy, Peter Westin years ago described anonymity as
a “state of privacy” that “occurs when the individual is in public places or
performingpublicactsbutstillseeks,andﬁnds,freedomfromidentiﬁcation
and surveillance.”102 Westin continued:
He may be riding a subway, attending a ball game, or walking the streets; he
is among people and knows that he is being observed; but unless he is a well-
known celebrity, he does not expect to be personally identiﬁed and held to the
full rules of behavior and role that would operate if he were known to those
observing him. In this state the individual is able to merge into the “situational
landscape.”103
While most would probably share the intuition of Rehnquist and Westin
that we expect some degree of anonymity in public, the burden of this
discussion is to establish a constitutional right to such anonymity. I do
so from three perspectives. First, I show how indiscriminate technological

public surveillance seriously undermines the way we would like our society
to function, because of its effect on public anonymity. Second, I argue that a
number of constitutional principles, while not explicitly recognizing a right
to public anonymity, provide solid groundwork for it. Finally, I report the
results of an empirical study suggesting that American citizens feel public
camera surveillance by the government is more intrusive than a variety
of other police actions that the Supreme Court has labeled a “search” or
“seizure,” a ﬁnding that bolsters the case for folding the right to anonymity
into the Fourth Amendment’s protections.
The Impact of Losing Public Anonymity
Anonymity in public promotes freedom of action and an open society.
Lack of public anonymity promotes conformity and an oppressive society.
These sentences summarize the conclusions of a host of thinkers about
public privacy.
the panopticon analogy.
The antithesis of public anonymity is the
Panopticon, a model prison ﬁrst imagined by Jeremy Bentham.104 The
Panopticon is circular, with the prison cells and walkways placed around
the perimeter and the guard station perched on top of a tower in the mid-
dle, an arrangement enabling a large number of prisoners to be watched
by just a few guards.105 In theory, every movement of every convict could
be monitored in such a building.
But the genius of this construction is that the guards, who are hidden by
venetianblinds,donotactuallyhavetowatchinordertoenforceorder.The
mere knowledge that one could be observed converts every prisoner into
his or her own warden. This latter observation is a key point of emphasis
for Michel Foucault, the renowned philosopher and historian, who elabo-
rated extensively on the modern implications of the Panopticon.106 As he
recognized, “[H]e who is subjected to a ﬁeld of visibility, and who knows
it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; . . . he becomes the
principle of his own subjection.”107
Of course, prisoners are subject to rigid rules of discipline, violation of
which can result in serious punishment. “Self-subjection” might not work
as well when those in charge of the surveillance do not have reprisal power
analogous to prison ofﬁcials. Foucault asserted, however, that modern so-
ciety increasingly functions like a super Panopticon, one that “assures the
automatic functioning of power” by rendering “its actual exercise unnec-

essary.”108 As both public and private entities pour more resources into
methods of monitoring people and architecture that facilitates it, Foucault
felt, ordinary citizens aware of this monitoring are likely to feel increasing
pressure to conform to whatever norms the observers are perceived to
endorse.109
For Foucault, this “panopticism” was not necessarily a bad thing, at least
compared with other methods of exercising control. He described it as “a
functional mechanism that . . . improves the exercise of power by making
it lighter, more rapid, more effective” than the older, balder ways of ensur-
ing appropriate conduct.110 Through the “subtle coercion” of panopticism,
people can be led to be more productive, efﬁcient members of society.111 In
the workplace, hospital, or school, the types of situations Foucault had in
mind, one can see some logic in this conclusion. In those locations, speciﬁc
rules govern people’s actions, rules that might be enforced most efﬁciently
through surveillance.
To the extent such “subtle coercion” operates on those in the public
byways, however, it can do serious damage to cherished values. To see why,
consider ﬁrst Justice Douglas’s comments in Papachristou v. Jacksonville
about public vitality in America:
Walking and strolling and wandering . . . are historically part of the amenities
of life as we have known them. . . . These unwritten amenities have been in
part responsible for giving our people the feeling of independence and self-
conﬁdence, the feeling of creativity. These amenities have digniﬁed the right of
dissent and have honored the right to be nonconformists and the right to defy
submissiveness. They have encouraged lives of high spirits rather than hushed,
suffocating silence.112
Quoting Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau, among others, Douglas
painted a picture of a society that thrives on free-spiritedness in public.113
Now consider, in contrast, some of the effects that Foucault ascribes
to the “discipline” that he says comes from panopticism. He tellingly calls
this discipline “an anti-nomadic technique.”114 Because it inhibits behav-
ior, it “arrests or regulates movements and dissipates compact groupings
of individuals wandering about the country in unpredictable ways. . . .”115
It also can “neutralize the effects of counter-power that spring from [the
multiple organizations in society] and which form a resistance to the power
that wishes to dominate it: agitations, revolts, spontaneous organizations,
coalitions—anything that may establish horizontal conjunctions.”116 These

effects are inconsistent, to put it mildly, with Douglas’s vision of the condi-
tions that a democratic, open society wants to nurture in its public spaces.
the effects of being watched.
How, more speciﬁcally, does panop-
ticism undermine public openness? Foucault does not answer this question
in detail. Others have, in ways that are directly relevant to public camera
surveillance. Shoshana Zuboff writes about the phenomenon of “anticipa-
tory conformity” among persons who believe they are being watched.117
Similarly, philosopher Jeffrey Reiman states that “when you know you
are being observed, you naturally identify with the outside observer’s
viewpoint, and add that alongside your own viewpoint on your action.
This double vision makes your act different, whether the act is making
love or taking a drive.”118 These observations suggest that any number
of individuals—ranging from political demonstrators119 to couples in love
and carefree teenagers120—could be inhibited by the knowledge that their
actions may be captured on camera.
Double vision is even more likely when the surveillance involves not
just observation but recording of one’s activities. For then, Richard Wasser-
strom notes, “no matter how innocent one’s intentions and actions at any
given moment . . . persons would think more carefully before they did
things that would become part of the record. Life would to this degree
become less spontaneous and more measured.”121 As Daniel Solove has
noted, the behavioral impact of surveillance is heightened by the reason-
able surmise that one’s recorded actions are easily susceptible to aggrega-
tion and use by a faceless bureaucracy.122 Nicolas Burbules similarly notes
that “as people accept the inevitability of being observed and recorded,
their habits change; they change.” He goes on to assert that these changes
are even more pervasive than we might think, because “people carry many
of the attitudes and self-imposed restrictions of activity from the surveyed
public into their private life.”123
The stultifying effect of public surveillance has been noted by many
others.124 But spontaneity is not all that could be hindered by routine pub-
lic surveillance. As Richard McAdams notes, “[T]he problem drinker who
goes to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, the patient who drives to his
psychiatrist’s ofﬁce, the homosexual who visits a gay bar, the spouse who
has a rendezvous with another lover, the teenager or adult who skips school
or work to go ﬁshing, would all be exposed if someone constantly tracked
their public movements.”125 The practice of seeking secret solace in parks
and other public places may also be circumscribed.126 None of these ac-

tivities is illegal, but it is easy to imagine why those who engage in them
might want to keep them secret.
In addition to its effect on behavior, CCTV might trigger a number of
unsettling emotional consequences. Relying on the work of Erving Goff-
man, Jeffrey Rosen notes that “it’s considered rude to stare at strangers
whom you encounter in public.”127 Staring, whether it occurs on an eleva-
tor, on public transportation, or on the street, violates the rules of “civil
inattention.”128 The cyclopsian gaze of the camera eye may be equally
disquieting, and perhaps more so, given the anonymity of the viewer and
the unavailability of normal countermeasures, such as staring back or re-
questing that the staring cease.
The small amount of social science research speciﬁcally aimed at as-
sessing the impact of concerted surveillance tends to verify that these and
other psychological and behavioral effects can occur. For instance, empiri-
cal investigations of the workplace—one of the contexts Foucault thought
might beneﬁt from panopticism—indicate that even there surveillance has
a downside. Monitored employees are likely to feel less trusted, less mo-
tivated, less loyal, and more stressed than employees who are not subject
to surveillance.129 The extent to which these ﬁndings would be duplicated
in the context of public surveillance is not clear.130 But one could plausibly
infer from them that many citizens on the street who are subject to camera
surveillance will experience less conﬁdence in their overall freedom to act,
as well as somewhat diminished loyalty to a government that must watch
its citizens’ every public movement. Roger Clarke also calls attention to
the latter possibility in his study of the effects of widespread surveillance.
Among the many consequences of “dataveillance,” as he calls it, are a
prevailing climate of suspicion, an increase in adversarial relationships
between citizens and government, and an increased tendency to opt out
of the ofﬁcial level of society.131
To capture the core of these disparate observations, consider again
Rehnquist’s example of police observing patrons of a bar. The people
entering the bar will feel less trusted and more anxious and may even stop
going there. Or try another simple thought experiment. Virtually all of
us, no matter how innocent, feel somewhat unnerved when a police car
pulls up behind us. Imagine now being watched by an ofﬁcer, at a discreet
distance and without any other intrusion, every time you walk through cer-
tain streets. Say you want to run (to catch a bus, for a brief bit of exercise,
or just for the hell of it). Will you? Or assume you want to obscure your
face (because of the wind or a desire to avoid being seen by an ofﬁcious

acquaintance). How about hanging out on the street corner (waiting for
friends or because you have nothing else to do)?
In all these scenarios, you will probably feel and perhaps act differently
than when the ofﬁcer is not there. Perhaps your hesitancy comes from un-
certainty as to the ofﬁcer’s likely reaction or simply from a desire to appear
completely law-abiding; the important point is that it exists. Government-
run cameras are a less tangible presence than the ubiquitous cop, but they
are better at recording your actions. A police ofﬁcer in Liverpool may
have said it best: a camera is like having a cop “on duty 24 hours a day,
constantly taking notes.”132
the government’s use of surveillance.
These inhibitory conse-
quences can be produced simply by setting up a camera system. If the
government acts on what the camera sees, those effects can be signiﬁcantly
enhanced. Of course, that is all to the good if the result is prevention of
serious criminal behavior. But sometimes government uses surveillance
to achieve more ambiguous ends. In the United Kingdom, many of the
crimes “solved” through CCTV are very minor offenses that are highly
subject to discriminatory prosecution, such as littering, urinating in public,
trafﬁc violations, drunkenness, loitering, failing to pay parking meters, and
even underage smoking.133 Indeed, camera use in publicly accessible malls
in Britain triggers law enforcement interventions even when there is no
infraction of the criminal law; rather, the decision is often based on “com-
mercial considerations” that characterize certain people (beggars, street
entertainers, and groups of youth) as “ﬂawed consumers.”134 Research
suggests that in other public areas as well, the impact of surveillance tends
to be the straightforward exclusion of disfavored groups rather than ap-
prehension or deterrence of criminals.135
Thus, Rosen concludes, CCTV’s primary use in Great Britain today is
not to thwart serious crime but “to enforce social conformity.”136 One con-
sequence, he reports, is that the cameras are “far less popular among black
men than among British men as a whole.”137 That should be no surprise
to those familiar with the American experience with loitering laws, stop
and frisk practices, and “aggressive patrolling.”138 Others view CCTV as
one of the most powerful forces pushing toward the “puriﬁcation” of city
spaces and their destruction as a stage for the “celebration of difference”
and disorder. The result is that public spaces are becoming less public.139
Government may also rely on cameras to observe (intimidate?) political
activists. On several occasions between 2000 and 2002, Washington, D.C.’s

street cameras were trained on individuals engaged in political demonstra-
tions. In 2003, Milwaukee police videotaped protesters outside President
George Bush’s fundraisers. Recent evidence that the FBI has directed
local law enforcement agencies to collect extensive information about the
tactics, training, and organization of antiwar demonstrators suggests the
various ways cameras and other methods of surveillance government can
use to monitor noncriminal activity it doesn’t like.140
Automated systems that do not depend on human operators have been
hailed as a method of avoiding these biases.141 But they do not necessarily
eliminate racist and other undesirable tendencies, since discretion is still
exercised once the alarm is triggered. Facial recognition systems that are
based simply on whether a person has previously been labeled a shoplifter
or car thief (sometimes erroneously)142 are likely to exacerbate these ten-
dencies. If one tries to remove the impact of human ﬂaws through full
automation, as with the motion detection systems described earlier, the
result is even more disturbing. Such systems are based on rigid catego-
rizations of behavior. As Norris notes, “[T]hey utilize no other logic than
whatever is programmed into their software, and the end point of such
processing is the creation of a binary system of classiﬁcation: access is ei-
ther accepted or denied; identity is either conﬁrmed or rejected; behavior
is either legitimate or illegitimate.”143
The implications of these various considerations should not be over-
stated. Contrary to the dire predictions of some privacy advocates, the
potential effects of public surveillance are not Orwellian in magnitude.
A principal feature of the society depicted in 1984 was the ever-present
telescreen that relayed citizens’ words and conduct back to an omniscient
“ministry.”144 But the dread that was rampant in Orwell’s ﬁctional Oceania
resulted primarily from the perception that the government was obsessed
with severely punishing amorphously deﬁned “thoughtcrimes” and “face-
crimes,” often with death.145 In the real world today, in contrast, the norms
likely to assume importance because of camera surveillance come from
the conscience of the mainstream and the business class, the imagination
of pedestrians and the calculations of technicians, and they are more likely
to result in exclusion from certain areas than any signiﬁcant formal pun-
ishment.
At the same time, in a society that wants to promote freedom of action,
camera surveillance—more speciﬁcally, concerted, overt public surveil-
lance using cameras with recording capacity—is clearly not an unalloyed
good, even if it does signiﬁcantly reduce crime. People who know they are

under government surveillance will act less spontaneously, more delib-
erately, less individualistically, and more conventionally. Conduct on the
streets that is outside the mainstream, susceptible to suspicious interpreta-
tion,ormerelyconspicuous—evenifperfectlyharmless—willdiminishand
perhaps even be ofﬁcially squelched. Some people subject to public camera
surveillance, perhaps in particular those from minority groups, will feel sig-
niﬁcant anxiety and discomfort although innocent of any crime, and some
may react with disdain for government, again despite and probably be-
cause of their innocence. Public camera surveillance undermines an open
society because it circumscribes out-of-the-ordinary behavior and makes
everyone—including the ordinary—more conscious of the government’s
presence, at least until behavior is suitably conformed and the cameras
forgotten.146 In short, CCTV accelerates the “disappearance of disappear-
ance.”147
The Constitution and Public Camera Surveillance
Do the potential effects of public camera surveillance on public anonymity
raise constitutional concerns, or are they merely subconstitutional mat-
ters that policymakers can either take into account or dismiss at their
discretion? Camera surveillance is certainly not as physically intrusive as
an arrest or stop or as invasive as a search of houses or belongings, the
paradigmatic government actions addressed by the Fourth Amendment.
But its aggregate impact can be equally signiﬁcant because it affects a much
larger number of people. It also evokes a particularly powerful image, of a
government that panoptically observes, records, and categorizes our every
movement in public.
As Laurence Tribe has emphasized, the Constitution should be inter-
preted with the “constitutive dimension of government action” in mind.148
We should think about the issues raised by public camera surveillance
“in terms of what they say about who and what we are as a people and
how they help to constitute us as a nation.”149 As it turns out, not just the
Fourth Amendment but a number of other provisions in the Constitution
are relevant to that endeavor.
freedom of speech and association.
The First Amendment guar-
antees freedom of speech and association. Recall Justice Douglas’s words
in Papachristou linking wandering and strolling with the right to dissent,
nonconformity, and deﬁance of submissiveness. Building on that language,

one might argue for a First Amendment right to be free of the inhibiting
effects of camera surveillance in public unless the government can proffer
some justiﬁcation for it.
Under the Supreme Court’s case law, however, neither the speech nor
the association guarantees are likely to provide a basis for constitutional
regulation of most public surveillance, at least when it is only visual. While
conduct alone can be expressive, the type of conduct normally captured
by cameras apparently does not ﬁt in this category. As the Court stated in
City of Dallas v. Stanglin, “[I]t is possible to ﬁnd some kernel of expression
in almost every activity a person undertakes—for example, walking down
the street, or meeting one’s friends at a shopping mall—but such a kernel is
not sufﬁcient to bring the activity within the protection of the First Amend-
ment.”150 Similarly, government inhibition of association is generally not
a violation of the First Amendment unless the group is engaged in some
type of speech activity.151
However, if public conduct is expressive—for instance, a speech at a
park rally—and public associations are speech related—such as joining the
rally—then the First Amendment should be implicated by camera surveil-
lance. That is because, as the previous section suggested, such surveillance
can chill conduct even though the conduct takes place in public and is
meant to be seen by others.
Admittedly, the Supreme Court rejected a similar claim in Laird v.
Tatum.152 There the plaintiffs contended that their antiwar activities were
inhibited by knowledge that the army was constructing dossiers on those
involved, allegedly as a means of averting potential civil disorder. Con-
struing the question to be “whether the jurisdiction of a federal court
may be invoked by a complainant who alleges that the exercise of his First
Amendment rights is being chilled by the mere existence, without more, of
a governmental investigative and data-gathering activity that is alleged to
be broader in scope than is reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of
a valid governmental purpose,”153 the Court dismissed the case. According
to the ﬁve-member majority, the plaintiffs had no standing because they
failed to allege any speciﬁc, foreseeable harm, other than an inchoate fear
that the information would somehow be used against them.154
The Court has since indicated, however, that a government action the
sole effect of which is to chill speech is justiciable under some circum-
stances.155 Tatum thus does not necessarily foreclose a First Amendment
argument against camera surveillance. The latter method of data collec-
tion is, in any event, distinguishable from the surveillance in Tatum. The

government’s efforts in Tatum consisted of perusing published material
and public records and surreptitiously attending meetings;156 furthermore,
the plaintiffs in Tatum alleged no speciﬁc acts by the army against them157
and may not even have been “chilled” in carrying out their activities.158 In
short, Tatum did not involve overt surveillance. The conspicuous presence
of cameras aimed at participants engaging in First Amendment activity,
in contrast, is closer to the more confrontational inhibition of speech that
has concerned the Court in cases where it has found violations of the First
Amendment.159 Although many lower courts have nonetheless been hos-
tile to First Amendment claims directed at camera surveillance (at least
when the surveillance consists solely of photography),160 several have up-
held standing claims when such surveillance targets or intimidates individ-
uals or causes a fall-off in attendance or membership in an organization,161
orwhentheresultsofthesurveillancearereleasedtonon-law-enforcement
entities.162
The chilling phenomenon has also long been recognized in other set-
tings, particularly in labor cases involving suits under the National Labor
Relations Act against employers who have photographed or videotaped
employees engaging in authorized strikes and demonstrations. In F.W.
Woolworth Co.,163 a representative example, the National Labor Rela-
tions Board concluded that “absent proper justiﬁcation, the photograph-
ing of employees engaged in protected concerted activities violates the
Act [speciﬁcally, its provision prohibiting employer actions that have a
“tendency to coerce”] because it has a tendency to intimidate.”164 More
so than mere observation, “pictorial recordkeeping tends to create fear
among employees of future reprisals.”165
As this last statement indicates, these holdings are bound up with the
notion that employers exercise power over employees, power that might
seem more palpable than the inﬂuence government exerts over citizens on
the public byways. But that fact does not distinguish the labor cases from
the public surveillance context. By deﬁnition, employer reprisals against
those who engage in “protected concerted activities” are prohibited; yet
the law recognizes that regardless of its actual impact on the employee’s
labor status, the photography can have an intimidating effect on employees
so engaged. Likewise, speech and association in public are protected ac-
tivities that should not result in government reprisal. But, understandably,
people might not believe that is so when they know or think government
cameras will be trained on them if they participate: if the activities are
protected, why does the government need cameras?

Another way that public camera surveillance trenches on First Amend-
ment rights of speech and association is its facilitation of the government’s
ability to pierce the anonymity of those engaging in expressive conduct.
The Court has declared that absent a signiﬁcant government justiﬁcation,
a person who writes a pamphlet166 or collects signatures for a petition167
cannot be required to reveal his or her name. It has also held that mem-
bership lists of organizations need not be revealed.168 As Justice Stevens
stated in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, whether “the decision in
favor of anonymity is motivated by fear of economic or ofﬁcial retaliation,
by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a desire to preserve as
much of one’s privacy as possible . . . it is an aspect of freedom of speech
protected by the First Amendment.”169
People who engage in expressive conduct in public know they will be ob-
served. But they may choose, like the pamphleteer or the petitioner, not to
reveal their identity, for all sorts of reasons. Camera surveillance virtually
nulliﬁes that effort. Because the camera’s recorded images are far better
identiﬁers than an informer’s memory, it vastly improves government ef-
forts to link visages with names. Furthermore, as one commentator points
out, “surveillance of a person’s movements could, over time, reveal associ-
ational tendencies as thoroughly as a membership list.”170 These facts can
only inhibit the public conduct of those who want to remain anonymous.
There is little doubt that public camera surveillance can infringe First
Amendmentvalues.Whenthosevaluesareimplicated,governmentshould
have to justify the presence of the cameras on a meaningful law enforce-
ment ground; indeed, even cases that reject First Amendment arguments
against camera surveillance seem reluctant to do so in the absence of a
legitimate government objective.171 Again, however, that conclusion pro-
vides constitutional protection only for expressive conduct, a category that
the Court has deﬁned rather narrowly. Other case law broadens that pro-
tection considerably.
freedom of movement and repose.
Derived from the Due Process
Clause, the right to travel is another fundamental right that might be com-
promised by public camera surveillance. As the Supreme Court stated
nearly a century ago, “Undoubtedly the right of locomotion, the right to
remove from one place to another according to inclination, is an attribute
of personal liberty, and the right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through
the territory of any state is a right secured by the 14th Amendment and
by other provisions of the Constitution.”172 Fifty years later that sentiment

was echoed in Kent v. Dulles,173 a case that dealt with restrictions on travel
overseas but used language relevant to domestic travel as well:
Freedom of movement across frontiers in either direction, and inside frontiers
as well, was a part of our heritage. Travel abroad, like travel within the country,
may be necessary for a livelihood. It may be as close to the heart of the individual
as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads. Freedom of movement is basic
in our scheme of values. . . . Outside areas of plainly harmful conduct, every
American is left to shape his own life as he thinks best, do what he pleases, go
where he pleases.174
As this language suggests, the “right of locomotion” is not limited to
expressive actions. In contrast to the First Amendment, this right is im-
portant for economic and social reasons as well as political ones. The Kent
Court went on to state explicitly that “freedom of movement also has large
social values,” including support of activities “close to the core of personal
life [such as] spending hours with old friends.”175 More recently the Court
has reafﬁrmed the right to travel as a guarantee implicit in the Privileges
and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.176
Closely related to the right to freedom of public movement is the right
to repose, or stasis, in public. In Chicago v. Morales, a four-member plural-
ity of the Court stated that “the freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is
part of the ‘liberty’ protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. . . . Indeed, it is apparent that an individual’s decision to re-
main in a public place of his choice is as much a part of his liberty as the
freedom of movement inside frontiers that is ‘a part of our heritage,’ or
the right to move ‘to whatsoever place one’s own inclination may direct’
identiﬁed in Blackstone’s Commentaries.”177 The Court has been emphatic
about striking down vagrancy statutes that trench on this right to repose.178
How might these interests in locomotion and stasis—the “freedom to
walk, stroll, or loaf”179—be affected by the panoptic eye of the camera? Al-
though no courts have directly addressed this issue, the few that have dealt
with analogous facts are wary of camera use that affects these interests,
at least when there is also proof of some animus. In Goosen v. Walker, for
instance, a Florida court enjoined the defendant from further videotaping
of his neighbors (with whom he had previously had altercations), conclud-
ing that his videotaping of them in their yard and adjoining areas, on two
to four occasions over a four-month period, constituted “stalking.”180 In
State v. Baumann, the court upheld an order that permanently enjoined

thirty-two individuals from photographing or videotaping people entering
and leaving an abortion clinic under circumstances that exhibited “an in-
tent to harass, intimidate or interfere with any person seeking access to or
departing from such facility.”181
Even the media, normally left unrestrained by courts concerned about
freedom of the press, can go too far. In Wolfson v. Lewis, for instance,
the court held that “a persistent course of hounding [by reporters], even
if conducted in a public or semi-public place, may nevertheless rise to
the level of invasion of privacy based on intrusion upon seclusion.”182 It
then issued an injunction against investigative news reporters who had
repeatedly sought to videotape and eavesdrop on a business executive
and his family in and outside their home and place of work.183
In Goosen the videotaping inhibited repose (in the targets’ backyard),
in Baumann it inhibited movement (to and from the abortion clinic), and
in Wolfson it inhibited both (around the house and workplace and going
to and from those locations). In all three, the videotaping was actionable.
That suggests that public surveillance, even when targeting actions not
protected by the First Amendment, can infringe interests in locomotion
and stasis to a legally cognizable degree.
At the same time, all three courts required proof that those who wielded
the cameras intended to harass. That type of motivation will usually be ab-
sent when government watches with public surveillance cameras. Using the
terminology of these cases, to say that the government’s camera surveil-
lance of people walking the streets constitutes the malicious-sounding acts
of “stalking,” “intimidation or interference,” or “a persistent course of
hounding” will normally be an exaggeration.
A crucial fact about these three cases, however, is that the defendants
were claiming a First Amendment right of their own—a right to videotape
public events. Thus, the courts had to ﬁnd a compelling justiﬁcation—
illegitimate harassment—for the injunctions they issued.184 Unlike its cit-
izens, the government does not have a First Amendment right to train
cameras on the populace. Accordingly, an absence of ill will on the part of
government agents who operate the cameras should not immunize them
from scrutiny. Instead, the issue should be, straightforwardly, whether gov-
ernment camera surveillance trenches on the right to movement or repose.
It clearly does, for reasons stated in the ﬁrst section of this chapter. Peo-
ple ogled by cameras may choose to walk rather than run, move on rather
than loiter, or even avoid going where they would like to go altogether.
While government surveillance may not amount to intentional stalking or

hounding, it is not innocuous. Indeed, whatever its intent, it can have a
similar effect to stalking, given its inhibition of public locomotion.
That conclusion does not dictate that such surveillance be prohibited, of
course. It simply requires, again, that the government demonstrate a legiti-
mate reason for its actions. As the Supreme Court has said, “[R]estrictions
on the right to travel . . . may not be achieved by means which sweep un-
necessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms.”185
the right to privacy.
A third constitutional basis for regulating CCTV
comes from the general right to privacy, which is found, depending on
the decision announcing the right, in the penumbras of the First, Third,
Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Pro-
cessClause,ortheNinthAmendment’sreservationofrightstothestates.186
The Supreme Court has relied on this right (which in the case law is of-
ten subsumed under a “due process right to liberty”) in striking down
laws banning abortion,187 interracial marriage,188 purchase and use of con-
traceptives,189 and the like. As with the rights to freedom of movement
and repose, the right to privacy is not limited to protection of expressive
conduct.
There are at least two versions of the right to privacy, one focusing on
protection of personhood and the second on freedom from normalization.
The personhood version views the right to privacy as a means of ensuring
that individuals are free to deﬁne themselves. It protects against state in-
terference in decisions that are “central to the personal identities of those
singled out.”190 The antinormalization version, in contrast, focuses on the
extent to which the government action standardizes lifestyles.191
Themannerinwhichpubliccamerasurveillanceaffectsourabilitytode-
ﬁne ourselves has already been suggested, but observations from Andrew
Taslitz ﬂesh out the analysis. Privacy, Taslitz notes, enables us to present to
others only the parts of ourselves that we want them to see.192 That in turn
enables us to put forth different versions of ourselves in different contexts,
with those at the job seeing one side, those at home seeing another, and
those at social events or athletic competitions seeing still another. Even in
public, we expect privacy to play its role as a facilitator of self-deﬁnition.
Taslitz quotes Michael Riesman’s observation that “people may look, but
they are expected to look at those parts that the owner of the exoself wants
them to look at, at appropriate times and following certain procedures.”193
Ogling, staring, or merely paying more than ﬂeeting attention to strangers
in public is considered impolite and uncivil, because it crosses personal

boundaries and requires us to reveal more of ourselves than courtesy dic-
tates. Such conduct prevents us from retaining control over how we present
ourselves.
Thus, Taslitz summarizes, “who looks at us, how, how long, and for what
purposes matter.”194 On camera surveillance in particular, he concludes:
[W]hen technology enables the government to stare with an ever-vigilant and
suspicious eye, the boundaries of the self may partly dissolve, reconstructed in
the image chosen by Leviathan. . . . Regulation [of this technology] preserves
the idea of a diverse, noisy America, where citizens are free to get lost in the
crowd and where their sense of self stems from their chosen afﬁliations and
actions rather than from the all-seeing gaze of the state.195
As the last sentence suggests, because a substantial part of our personality
is developed in public venues through rituals of our daily lives that oc-
cur outside the home and outside the family, cameras that stultify public
conduct can stiﬂe personality development. The Supreme Court itself has
said that anonymity “safeguards the ability independently to deﬁne one’s
identity that is central to any concept of liberty.”196
The second version of the right to privacy, championed by Jed Ruben-
feld, pushes toward the same conclusion but from a different direction.
Rubenfeld argues that the Court’s privacy cases most directly protect “the
fundamental freedom not to have one’s life too totally determined by a
progressively more normalizing state.”197 A prohibition on abortion and
use of contraceptives is unconstitutional, he says, not because decisions
about those issues are necessary to self-deﬁnition, but because together
they force women to be mothers; a prohibition on interracial marriages is
unconstitutional not because it infringes one’s autonomy to do what one
wants, but because it coerces people into having homogeneous children.
The danger of such laws, Rubenfeld states, “is a particular kind of creep-
ing totalitarianism, an unarmed occupation of individuals’ lives. That is the
danger of which Foucault as well as the right to privacy is warning us: a
society standardized and normalized, in which lives are too substantially
or too rigidly directed. That is the threat posed by state power in our
century.”198
Note in particular Rubenfeld’s use of Foucault, who was concerned
about the modern state’s ability, “through expanded technologies and far
more systematic methods of acculturation, . . . to watch over and shape
our lives, to dispose and predispose us, and to inscribe into our lives and

consciousnesses its particular designs.”199 Although Rubenfeld does not
speak of government surveillance directly, his argument that the right to
privacy has been and should be ranged against government actions that
promote “normalization” has signiﬁcant implications for that particular
type of state action. As Simon Davies commented in describing the effect
of CCTV and other forms of technological surveillance, “the society we
are developing now . . . is a Brave New World dominated not so much by
tyranny as by a deadening political and cultural phenomenon that Ralph
Nader calls ‘harmony ideology’ [the coming together of opposing ideolo-
gies and beliefs into manufactured consensus].”200 If CCTV contributes to
that effect—and the literature linking panopticism and anticipatory con-
formity suggests it does—it impinges directly on the privacy right that
Rubenfeld believes the Court’s decisions establish, and should be regu-
lated accordingly.
freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures.
None of
these arguments about a constitutional basis for regulating government
camera surveillance rely directly on the Fourth Amendment. Surely if
CCTV implicates the First Amendment, the due process rights to move-
ment and repose, or the general right to privacy, it ought to implicate the
Fourth Amendment as well. Yet the Supreme Court’s case law construing
the scope of that amendment leaves little room for such a position.
The ﬁrst obstacle in this regard is Katz itself, which baldly stated that
“what a person knowingly exposes to the public . . . is not a subject of
Fourth Amendment protections.” This was also the sentiment informing
the Court’s reasoning in Knotts when it held that use of a beeper to mon-
itor movement on the public highway is not a search. Application of this
formulation to CCTV is likely to produce the same result. One might
argue that people do not always “know” that certain public conduct was
exposed to the camera, but that strategy is unlikely to work under most
circumstances. First, we are talking about overt, not covert, camera use,
accompanied by signs announcing its presence. Second, recall from chap-
ter 3 that according to the Court, the government need not show actual
knowledge of surveillance to nullify Fourth Amendment protection.201 All
that need be shown is that the target should have known public exposure
might occur; if it does, the Court has held, the individual assumes the risk
of such exposure and loses Fourth Amendment protection.
That’s not all. Time and again, as chapter 3 documented, the Court has
emphasized the distinction between mere observation and physical intru-
sion.202 Thus, according to Ciraolo and Dow Chemical, police observation

from a public vantage point is not a search even if the area observed is the
curtilage, traditionally considered to be part of the home. Indeed, even
if the target is the home itself, the degree of physical intrusion plays an
important role, as the naked eye exception announced in Kyllo demon-
strates. Thus, to the extent CCTV merely replicates naked eye viewing
from a public vantage point, it is unlikely to merit Fourth Amendment
protection either.
Similarly, despite CCTV’s inhibition of the right to movement, it is
unlikely to amount to a Fourth Amendment seizure under the Court’s
cases. Such a seizure occurs when the government, “by means of physical
force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a
citizen”203 or at least when “a reasonable person [would not be] at liberty
to ignore the police presence and go about his business.”204 Although the
latter formulation could in theory encompass the effects of CCTV, which
may well retard people’s ability to go about their business, the Court has
twice held that police do not effect a seizure if they conspicuously follow
or chase an individual without bringing the individual to a stop.205 Under
this case law, it would be difﬁcult to argue that monitoring an individual
with a camera is a seizure.
But what about the fact that CCTV allows recording of one’s public
activity? It has been argued that even if we assume the risk that others will
view our public conduct, we do not assume the risk that our public actions
will be reduced to a photograph or ﬁlm that can be “scrutinized indeﬁ-
nitely and disseminated to an unintended audience” and that “allows the
viewer to discern details that would not have been apparent to a casual
observer.”206 This argument too is plausible, but once again the Court’s
cases are very unhelpful as support. In On Lee v. United States, decided
before Katz, the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment is not
implicated when the government overhears and records an individual’s
conversation with an informer through a body bug worn by the informer,207
a holding it afﬁrmed post-Katz.208 If we have to assume the risk that our
acquaintances are secretly recording our private conversations, we prob-
ably also have to assume the risk that overt CCTV will be recording our
public conduct.
There are three lines of attack against this view of the Fourth Amend-
ment’s (non)application to CCTV. The ﬁrst, of course, is to distinguish
CCTV and other types of public surveillance from the Court’s cases to
date. One might insist, for instance, that CCTV does result in a seizure
because of its effect on movement or because it records and preserves our
images. Or one might argue that it does constitute a search because people

who have to go into public spaces (i.e., virtually everyone) don’t meaning-
fully consent to public surveillance, or because being watched throughout
the day is not a risk we assume when we go out in public. The futility of
these types of arguments has already been suggested, and in any event will
not be pursued here.
The second method of combating judicial acquiescence to unregulated
public surveillance is to proffer some alternative to privacy as the focus
of Fourth Amendment analysis. But despite much intriguing scholarship
along these lines (some of it canvassed in chapter 2), the Court has refused
to reconsider Katz. Moreover, as should be clear by now, what is misguided
is not the Court’s insistence on privacy as the linchpin of Fourth Amend-
ment jurisprudence but its equation of Fourth Amendment privacy with
the assumption-of-risk and public-exposure concepts.
That takes us to the most powerful line of attack, which involves ex-
plicitly switching from an analysis based on these latter concepts to an
analysis grounded on the Court’s alternative, and arguably more funda-
mental, admonition that the Fourth Amendment’s scope be deﬁned ac-
cording to expectations of privacy that “society is prepared to recognize
as ‘reasonable.’ ” This language strongly suggests that society’s views, not
the Court’s, are the most important determinants of the privacy afforded
by the Fourth Amendment, and it begs for an empirical inquiry into those
views. The next section brieﬂy describes one effort at such an inquiry, which
resulted in ﬁndings that support the Fourth Amendment’s application to
CCTV.
III. An Empirically Based Case for Fourth Amendment
Regulation of CCTV
Basing Fourth Amendment protection on society’s expectations of privacy
requires answering several questions. First, how can we discover these
expectations?Second,whatarethey?Third,inwhatsensearetheyrelevant
to Fourth Amendment analysis?
Sources of Society’s Privacy Expectations vis-à-vis CCTV
How does one determine society’s views about whether CCTV threatens
privacy? Two sources come to mind. The ﬁrst is the positive law govern-
ing public camera surveillance by entities other than the government. If

such surveillance is a crime or a tort, then it might be said to infringe on
expectations of privacy considered important by society.
At ﬁrst glance, both case law and statutory law appear to indicate quite
the opposite. As noted previously, the few court decisions that address
overt videotaping of public activity by private actors generally require a
signiﬁcant degree of maliciousness before relief will be granted.209 Statu-
tory law regarding public camera use is also sparse. Recall that no statutes
regulate nonprurient videotaping of public areas, in contrast to the many
state laws that prohibit or signiﬁcantly limit use of cameras to capture
activities within the home.
The paucity of positive law regulating public camera use probably says
little about society’s attitudes toward CCTV, however, because nothing
like CCTV exists in the private sector. No entity other than the government
engages in concerted, overt surveillance of the public streets using cameras.
If private companies or individuals began sharing round-the-clock record-
ings of all public spaces in an effort to discern, say, people’s shopping,
exercise, eating, and drinking patterns, both tort and statutory regulation
would probably be forthcoming, just as has occurred in the transaction
surveillance area now that private companies have begun accumulating
data from our personal records (as to which, see chapter 7).210
A second source of information about society’s views concerning the
intrusiveness of CCTV comes from polls directly asking about attitudes
toward CCTV. Although to date there are few polls of that type in the
United States,211 researchers in the United Kingdom have conducted sev-
eral. All of them show signiﬁcant public support for CCTV, well above
60 percent.212 Yet the most sophisticated poll of this type also indicated
signiﬁcant concern about the practice, despite its prevalence. More than
50 percent of the respondents felt that some entity other than the govern-
ment or private security ﬁrms should be responsible for the installation
of CCTV in public places, 72 percent agreed that “these cameras could
easily be abused and used by the wrong people,” 39 percent believed that
the people in control of these systems could not be “completely trusted to
use them only for the public good,” and 37 percent felt that “in the future,
cameras will be used by the government to control people.”213 More than
10 percent of the respondents believed that CCTV cameras should be
banned.214 Americans, who tend to be more concerned about government
power than the British, would probably be even more hostile to CCTV.
More important, poll results showing favorable attitudes toward CCTV
fail to distill feelings about intrusiveness from feelings about security.

Those who say they do not mind government camera surveillance may
be allowing its perceived effectiveness at preventing crime to submerge
their discomfort about being watched. That attitude makes sense; indeed,
if the threat of harm to be prevented is high, a wide range of people will wel-
come policing techniques much more intrusive than camera surveillance,
as reactions to the events of September 11 showed. Under the Fourth
Amendment, however, that type of balancing/reasonableness calculus is
not supposed to inform the initial question whether something is a search
or seizure, but rather, as chapter 2 pointed out, only whether something
that is a search or seizure is justiﬁed.
ToisolatetheintrusivenessquestionmorecleanlywithrespecttoCCTV,
I conducted a study using the same methodology that Professor Schu-
macher and I developed for the research described in chapter 2. In that
study, we asked people how they rated the intrusiveness of a number of
police investigative techniques. That approach permits a better assessment
of how people feel about the effect each technique has on privacy, because
it produces a hierarchy of perceived intrusiveness; even people who are
willing to sacriﬁce most or all of their privacy interests to ﬁght crime eval-
uate the privacy-invading impact of different crime-ﬁghting techniques
differently. Thus, for instance, on average our subjects rated a body cavity
search as the most intrusive of the scenarios and a search of a public park
as the least, and a search of a bedroom as more intrusive than a frisk.
From these types of results, one can draw useful conclusions about the
relative magnitude of people’s expectations of privacy with respect to a
given technique such as CCTV.
Unfortunately, the ﬁfty scenarios in our earlier research did not include
any involving camera surveillance. The empirical effort reported here ﬁlls
that gap.
The Study
The survey form developed for this study was similar to the form used in the
earlier study, with a few notable exceptions. First, it contained only twenty
relevant scenarios,215 not ﬁfty. Second, it included either two or three sce-
narios (depending on which of three survey versions the subject received)
describing various forms of camera surveillance. The camera surveillance
scenarios involved police use of cameras (all with zoom capacity) to view
(1) national monuments, (2) stores, (3) airports and other transportation
centers, and (4) public streets (with the latter involving cameras placed

every three hundred yards). The public street scenario had two variations:
overt versus hidden cameras, and destruction of records within ninety-six
hours versus indeterminate retention of records that could be released to
government agencies and the media as needed. Also new with this survey
form were scenarios involvingother types of technological physical surveil-
lance (i.e., beepers and “see-through” devices) and a scenario describing
a police ofﬁcer following an individual on the public street.
The survey was completed by 190 people called for jury duty in Gaines-
ville,Florida.Because Floridajurypools arerandomly selected from driver
registration lists, this sample was a relatively diverse group of people. As
in the earlier study, the subjects were told to assume that in each scenario,
the police were looking for evidence of crime but that the target of the
police action had not engaged in any criminal activity. In other words, the
subjects were told to assume the individuals in the scenarios were inno-
cent, an assumption that is consistent with the Supreme Court’s deﬁnition
of search and seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes.216 Then, as in the
earlier study, the subjects were told to rate each scenario in terms of intru-
siveness on a scale of 1 to 100, with 1 representing “not intrusive” and 100
representing “very intrusive.”
Using these ratings from the participants, an average intrusiveness rat-
ing for each scenario was calculated, along with the standard deviation so
that the statistical signiﬁcance of any differences between averages could
be computed. As with the previous study, several such differences resulted.
The table below reports the mean intrusiveness rating of the twenty scenar-
ios, together with their conﬁdence intervals (a ﬁgure that, when added to or
subtracted from the mean, indicates the extent to which a given difference
between means is statistically signiﬁcant).217 The following discussion will
focus on the ﬁndings most relevant to understanding what the subjects
thought about camera surveillance.
The most important ﬁnding of the study for purposes of this chapter
was the relative rating of the scenario involving cameras overtly positioned
along the street, with recordings destroyed within a short period of time
(the typical arrangement in many American cities). As can be seen from
the table above, that scenario (13) received an average intrusiveness rating
of 53 (M = 53). This rating was signiﬁcantly lower (as a statistical matter)
than the rating for bedroom searches (M = 76), body cavity searches (M =
75), and electronic eavesdropping on conversations in public (M = 70), all
ofwhichrequireprobablecause,218 aswellaslowerthantheratingforovert

for overt surveillance resulting in a short-term record was also signiﬁcantly
lower than the rating for either a traditional (M = 68) or electronic frisk
(M = 67), both of which require reasonable suspicion.219 At the same time,

(M = 25), and a ﬁfteen-second stop at a roadblock (M = 35), and similar to
the rating for a junkyard search, all government actions that the Supreme
Court has declared are governed by the Fourth Amendment.220
The intrusiveness ratings for the other scenarios involving cameras fell
within the range demarcated by the latter three scenarios, with one excep-
tion. While camera surveillance of national monuments (M = 20), trans-
portation centers (M = 20), and stores (M = 26) received relatively low
intrusiveness ratings, covert camera surveillance of public streets (M = 42)
received a signiﬁcantly higher rating. At the same time, that rating is sig-
niﬁcantly lower than the rating for overt camera surveillance. Apparently,
knowledge that cameras are present triggers a greater feeling of intrusion
than knowledge that cameras might be present.

Also of note are the intrusiveness ratings of three government actions
the Court has declared are not searches: helicopter overﬂights four hun-
dred feet above the backyard (M = 50), being followed by a police ofﬁcer
(M = 50), and curbside searches of garbage (M = 51).221 These three sce-
narios were perceived to be as intrusive, statistically speaking, as public
camera surveillance resulting in a short-term record and signiﬁcantly more
intrusive than the administrative inspections and the roadblock.
ShouldtheselastthreeﬁndingscallintoquestiontheCourt’sdetermina-
tions that administrative inspections and roadblocks are Fourth Amend-
ment events, or instead lead us to question the holdings that helicopter
overﬂights, police tailing, and garbage scavenging (and, by implication,
public camera surveillance) are not? Consistent with the thesis of this
book, I believe we should be more concerned about the second set of
Supreme Court holdings, for two reasons. First, all these scenarios were
rated as more intrusive, by a very large margin, than the paradigmatic
situation in which privacy is nonexistent, i.e., searching through foliage in
a public park (M = 8). Second, the survey participants are better represen-
tatives of society than the members of the Court, and thus their opinions
are more probative regarding expectations of privacy society is prepared
to recognize as reasonable. Of course, both of these reasons rely on the
ﬁndings of the survey, a reliance that requires further justiﬁcation.
The Relevance of Empirical Findings
As Professor Schumacher and I noted in connection with the previous
study, there are several potential methodological problems with this kind
ofsurvey.222Theseinternalandexternalvalidityissueswillnotberehearsed
in detail here. With respect to internal validity, it sufﬁces to say that, despite
some reservations, we concluded in the earlier work that this type of survey
“accurately measured how people rank the intrusiveness of various search
and seizures.”223 More suspect is the external validity of this study, given its
paper-and-pencil nature. But note that the justices of the Supreme Court
also decide Fourth Amendment questions in the abstract (that is, without
experiencing the actual police-citizen interaction). Furthermore, they are
much further removed from the reality of those interactions than the study
participants, who, as noted above, are also much more representative of
the community.
Assuming no signiﬁcant methodological problems, then, it is still im-
portant to revisit one central issue: why should we care, for constitutional
purposes, what ordinary people think about the intrusiveness of various

police actions? One easy answer is the one already given: the Court has
told us that society’s views are relevant by deﬁning the Fourth Amendment
in terms of expectations of privacy that “society is prepared to recognize
as ‘reasonable.’ ” But perhaps this language should not be interpreted lit-
erally. There are at least three reasons why it may be a bad idea to do
so. These reasons are all complicated, but they deserve at least a brief
description here.
One possible reason to avoid a literal reading of Katz is the variabil-
ity and manipulability of public attitudes. Technology and modern social
practices are rapidly reducing everyone’s privacy, as well as everyone’s ex-
pectations thereof, with the result that a literal construction of Katz would
produce an ever-shrinking Fourth Amendment. Resort to empirical data
about society’s attitudes in deﬁning the Fourth Amendment’s scope would
probably accelerate that trend, and destabilize search and seizure law at
the same time.
Research such as that described here, however, only provides informa-
tion concerning society’s views about relative intrusiveness. It does not tell
the Court where to position the Fourth Amendment threshold (e.g., at a
mean of 15 or 50 on a 100-point intrusiveness scale). The decision as to the
level at which privacy expectations are accorded constitutional protection
can still be a judicial, normative one that has precedential impact. Nor are
society’s views likely to change once the Court sets the Fourth Amendment
threshold, because the Court’s pronouncement will reinforce those views.
If, however, those views nonetheless change substantially—for instance, if
twenty years from now, government-run CCTV is seen as much less intru-
sive than searching foliage in a public park or much more intrusive than
a frisk—then Fourth Amendment analysis should probably change with
them. After all, that is what happened when Katz declared nontrespas-
sory electronic surveillance a search after forty years of precedent saying
otherwise.
A second objection to a literal interpretation of Katz’s expectation-
of-privacy language is that at the margins it might render nugatory the
language and history of the Fourth Amendment. Consider overt CCTV
systems as an example. One could argue, as suggested earlier, that CCTV
does not constitute either a search or a seizure of persons, papers, houses,
and effects as those terms are normally understood. One could also plausi-
bly contend that it is not the type of government activity that even remotely
concerned the framers. These points, the constitutional theorist might say,
far outweigh data on community sentiments about CCTV’s intrusiveness.

Ofcourse,therearealsononempiricalargumentsthatrebutthesepoints
and are consistent with the survey ﬁndings. As indicated in chapter 2, close
scrutiny of a person, whether in public or private, by camera or the naked
eye, can easily be called a search. And while it is true that physical searches,
particularly of homes, were the main concern of the framers, surveillance
of the streets by British soldiers was also a major irritant for the colonists.224
Ultimately, however, the strength of this second objection depends on how
important plain meaning and original intent are to Fourth Amendment
analysis and on what these phrases mean, topics that are the subject of
much debate and outside the scope of this book.225
A related and ﬁnal objection to taking Katz literally is that courts
should consider only these latter types of factors—plain meaning, orig-
inal intent, philosophical principles—and never look at community views,
because courts are, by tradition if not by deﬁnition, nonmajoritarian in-
stitutions. While some constitutional issues—the deﬁnition of obscenity
comes to mind226—largely reﬂect the community’s conscience, most such
issues—compulsion for Fifth Amendment purposes,227 speech under the
FirstAmendment,228probablecauseforFourthAmendmentpurposes229—
do not. As the Supreme Court has said, “One’s right to life, liberty, and
property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly,
and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend
on the outcome of no elections.”230 At the least, shouldn’t the courts ignore
community norms that are inconsistent with principles derived from other
sources when determining the scope of core constitutional concepts?
This question is also huge and difﬁcult, and the answer depends much
on context. Robert Post, a noted scholar on privacy issues, provides the
beginning of a response, a response pertinent to the other two objections
as well. Post describes three “concepts of privacy”: privacy as the control
of knowledge, privacy as a protector of dignity, and privacy as a means
of implementing freedom.231 The ﬁrst concept, he argues, does not really
raise a privacy question at all, because it has more to do with disclosure
of information than with intrusion, and the third he sees as “an argument
for liberal limitations on government” such as those imposed by cases
such as Roe v. Wade.232 The form of privacy he views as most relevant to
Fourth Amendment issues is privacy as dignity, which grounds privacy “in
social forms of respect that we owe each other as members of a common
community” and “locates privacy in precisely the aspects of social life that
are shared and mutual.”233 He asserts that when privacy “is understood as
a form of dignity, there can ultimately be no other measure of privacy than

the social norms that actually exist in our civilization.”234 If that is so, then
Fourth Amendment privacy depends on measurements of societal norms
regarding privacy expectations, which is what the survey described above
attempts to measure.
There is also an institutional reason to align Fourth Amendment expec-
tations of privacy with society’s views on the matter. As stated in the article
describingourﬁrststudy,“assumingvaliddatashowingthatthecommunity
and the Court think differently, the Court’s continued adherence to its own
views, through what has aptly been called normative constitutional fact-
ﬁnding, would further strain its credibility.”235 Ultimately, ignoring such
data and the community views the data represent undermines the Court’s
legitimacy.236
Conclusion
A good case can be made for the conclusion that overt CCTV operated
by the government in public spaces ought to be subject to constitutional
regulation. The source of such regulation could be the First Amendment,
the right to travel found in the Due Process Clause, the general right to
privacy, or the Fourth Amendment. CCTV can intimidate those engaging
in political expression, inhibit public movement and repose, affect one’s
public personality, accelerate normalization, and, if the empirical study
reported here is any indication, be as intrusive as police actions that the
Supreme Court has said implicate the Fourth Amendment. Although the
interests infringed by CCTV are somewhat disparate, they can all be sub-
sumed under the umbrella interest in public anonymity—the right to be
free of intensive government scrutiny, absent suspicious conduct, even in
public.237
Of the various constitutional bases that could implement this right to
anonymity, I prefer the Fourth Amendment, for two related reasons. First,
it is the amendment that traditionally has been applied to police inves-
tigation techniques, and CCTV is such a technique. The Court has sug-
gested that when two or more constitutional provisions are applicable,
the one most directly implicated should apply.238 Second, Fourth Amend-
ment analysis provides a better framework for regulating CCTV than the
other constitutional doctrines. If a government action infringes the First
Amendment, the Due Process Clause, or the general right to privacy, its
permissibility depends on whether the government has a “compelling” or

“substantial” interest in pursuing the action, concepts that are very ill-
deﬁned. Depending on the interest involved, the action’s legitimacy may
also hinge on how “necessary” it is to accomplish that interest, again a neb-
ulously deﬁned inquiry.239 Although essentially the same analysis occurs
under the Fourth Amendment, its greater ﬂexibility and its better devel-
oped substantive and procedural rules provide a more concrete regulatory
template, as the next chapter demonstrates.

Implementing the Right to Public
Anonymity
T
he conclusion that public surveillance must be subject to constitu-
tional strictures does not necessarily mean that the usual Fourth
Amendment jurisprudence—involving warrants, probable cause, and so
on—applies. Relying on the proportionality concept, this chapter argues
that the courts should set minimal guidelines and monitor police decisions
to ensure that such surveillance is conducted in a reasonable manner.
Given its relatively unintrusive nature, however, most public surveillance
of individuals does not require probable cause in the traditional sense. At
the same time, rules regarding who is involved in the targeting decision,
the execution of the police action, and subsequent record-keeping and
disclosure should assume much more signiﬁcance here than in connection
with the classic police search.
More speciﬁcally, I propose that constitutional regulation of govern-
ment efforts to pierce public anonymity through CCTV consist of four
components. First, law enforcement should have to justify both the estab-
lishment of a particular camera system and its use to scrutinize particular
individuals. Second, it should have to develop policies regarding the proce-
dure for conducting camera surveillance. Third, it should have to develop
policiesregarding storage and dissemination of recorded materials to other
entities. Finally, and most important, it should be accountable to entities
outside law enforcement when it fails to follow these three requirements.
Even this bare-bones description of the regulatory scheme sounds de-
cidedly legislative in natureand thereforearguably something the judiciary
is not equipped to fashion. But as the following discussion makes clear, the
judicial objective should be merely to establish the regulatory framework;
law enforcement agencies and political actors can ﬁll in the details. Erik

Luna has described the phenomenon of “constitutional roadmapping,”
in which the courts, in striking down governmental laws or censoring con-
duct of government agents, suggest constitutionally permissible alternative
courses of action.1 The idea behind such decisions is to encourage a dia-
logue with the executive and legislative branches as well as the citizenry.2
As Professor Luna says, road maps “openly share constitutional concerns
with those institutions charged with making and enforcing law, refracting
issues with judicial insight rather than merely reﬂecting them back to the
political branches.”3 Although Luna believes that judicial resort to these
quasi-legislative pronouncements should be rare, he also states that they
are most likely to be useful in individual rights cases involving new prac-
tices where the need for clear rules is high, a scenario that resonates with
the advent of CCTV.4 The discussion below sets out a constitutional road
map for public camera surveillance, relying on Fourth Amendment prece-
dent for guiding principles and the ABA’s Standards on Technologically-
Assisted Physical Surveillance for slightly more speciﬁc recommendations
that might be followed by legislatures.5
I. Justiﬁcation
The government should be required to justify its use of cameras in two
ways. First, it should have to justify the placement of the cameras it seeks
to install. Second, it should have to account for the use of the cameras to
inspect particular individuals. Precedent for requiring both justiﬁcations
comes from the Supreme Court’s cases on roadblocks, which were viewed
by the subjects in the study reported in the previous chapter to be signiﬁ-
cantly less intrusive than CCTV.
Justifying Camera Location
One might think that the cost of camera systems alone would keep CCTV
from spreading beyond areas with the highest crime rates. But if Great
Britain’s experience is any indication, cameras are likely to be seen as
a cheap, effective method of deterring and detecting crime, whether or
not that is actually the case. Thus, their proliferation beyond the most
dangerous areas is inevitable unless limitations are imposed.
The precedent for limitation comes from an unlikely source: the Su-
preme Court’s roadblock jurisprudence.6 In the ﬁve cases in which the
Court has pronounced on the constitutionality of roadblocks, the govern-

ment has prevailed four times. In United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,7 the
Court upheld checkpoints established near the Mexican border that were
designed to deter and detect illegal immigration. In Michigan Department
of State Police v. Sitz,8 it sanctioned roadblocks to deter drunken driving.
In between these two cases, the Court decided Delaware v. Prouse,9 where
it indicated in dictum that license checkpoints would be constitutional as
well (in the course of holding that random license checks of individual cars
are unconstitutional). And just a few terms ago, in Illinois v. Lidster,10 the
Court sanctioned a checkpoint at the location of a hit-and-run accident in
an effort to identify possible witnesses to the accident.
In a case decided in 2000, however, the Court drew the line at road-
blocks that are set up merely to help the government catch more crimi-
nals. In City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, the Court held unconstitutional
a “narcotics checkpoint,” stating, “we have never approved a checkpoint
program whose primary purpose was to detect evidence of ordinary crimi-
nal wrongdoing.”11 Martinez-Fuerte, Justice O’Connor wrote for the Court,
was grounded on the “formidable law enforcement problems” connected
with “effectively containing illegal immigration at the border,” the “im-
practicality of the particularized study of a given car to discern whether
it was transporting illegal aliens,” and the traditional leeway given the
government’s efforts to protect the “integrity of the border.” The sobriety
checkpoints in Sitz were permissible because they were aimed at reducing
“the immediate vehicle-bound threat to life and limb” posed by the pres-
ence of drunken drivers on the highways. And license checkpoints of the
type discussed in Prouse, O’Connor stated, are meant to maintain highway
safety through ensuring that drivers are qualiﬁed and that their vehicles
are ﬁt for safe operation.12 In Lidster, decided after Edmond, the Court
similarly emphasized that the purpose behind the roadblock there was to
seek information from possible witnesses to a death rather than gather
evidence against those stopped.13 None of these roadblock variants, the
Edmond majority stressed and Lidster reiterated, are established to fur-
ther the government’s “general interest in crime control.”14 In the latter
situation, an “individualized suspicion” requirement prevails.15 Otherwise,
“the Fourth Amendment would do little to prevent such intrusions from
becoming a routine part of American life.”16
There is no doubt that the primary purpose of CCTV is to implement the
government’s general interest in crime control. If we assume, as concluded
above, that CCTV is regulated by the Fourth Amendment, Edmond’s ra-
tionale could be read to prohibit government use of cameras unless there is

individualized suspicion or one of the circumstances identiﬁed in Martinez-
Fuerte, Sitz, or Lidster exists (Prouse is set aside for the moment). In other
words, in the absence of individualized suspicion, CCTV should be permit-
ted only where it can be shown that there is a “formidable law enforcement
problem” associated with using traditional methods of investigation (as in
the case of discerning illegal immigrants in cars), an immediate hazard to
life and limb posed by a speciﬁed group of potentially dangerous people
(as with drunken drivers), or a need to obtain information about a serious
crime (as occurred in Lidster).
The third situation is self-explanatory. But when might the ﬁrst two
circumstances exist? Areas with a high magnitude of serious crime are the
best candidates. A signiﬁcant amount of crime suggests that traditional
law enforcement methods are not working, and if much of the crime being
committed is violent or similarly serious, it presents an immediate hazard
proportionate to that posed by drunken drivers. Using the terminology
introduced in chapter 2, CCTV should be limited to those areas associated
with a “generalized suspicion” of serious crime.
Taking a cue from the Court’s cases, it is possible to specify even more
exactly the degree of harm necessary to justify brief suspicionless surveil-
lance. In Sitz the Court said that the checkpoint there was reasonable
in part because 1.6 percent of the drivers who went through the road-
block were drunk; the Court also noted that .12 percent of those stopped
at the checkpoint in Martinez-Fuerte were illegal immigrants.17 The lat-
ter percentage might presumptively be considered the threshold at which
government can act, for two reasons. First, in Martinez-Fuerte it justiﬁed
only the barest of seizures, one that lasted at most ﬁve seconds and that
often consisted merely of getting the vehicle to slow down so that border
agents could look inside.18 Anything less intrusive would probably not have
implicated the Fourth Amendment at all; anything more should require at
least as much justiﬁcation as the government proffered in Martinez-Fuerte.
Second, the Court has indicated it is leery of suspicionless seizures that
inconvenience large numbers of individuals for very little gain. In ﬁnding
unconstitutional the random license checks at issue in Prouse, it noted
that “the percentage of all drivers on the road who are driving without a
license is very small and . . . the number of licensed drivers who will be
stopped in order to ﬁnd one unlicensed operator will be large indeed.”19
Although Prouse went on to sanction nonrandom roadblocks for license
check purposes, this type of seizure, Edmond held, is permitted only when
it is directly related to highway safety, not crime control. In the latter

instance, Prouse and Edmond in combination would seem to say that hit
rates lower than those obtained in Martinez-Fuerte cannot justify searches
or seizures by the government.
Insomewhatarbitrary“generalizedsuspicion”terms,then,CCTVmight
be permitted only in areas where more than one person in a thousand
surveilled will commit some type of serious crime.20 It might also be permis-
sible in more idiosyncratic circumstances. For instance, as Edmond itself
suggested and consistent with the danger exception outlined in chapter 2,
cameras might be positioned in areas that are not particularly crime-ridden
but are predicted to be the focus of some imminent, serious threat to life
and limb, such as terrorism.21 In such locations, or where crime ﬂuctuates,
cameras might be set up but switched off except during particular times
or events, as occurs in Washington, D.C. Ideally these kinds of decisions
would be made after studying crime patterns that identiﬁed locales partic-
ularly likely to attract certain types of serious criminal activity or harbor
dangerous criminals.
An equally important aspect of the justiﬁcation inquiry is determin-
ing who decides whether crime in a given area is of sufﬁcient magnitude
to warrant CCTV—the police, a court, a legislature, or the public. The
Court’s cases suggest the decision should be left up to law enforcement.
For instance, in rejecting the argument that courts should determine the
propriety of sobriety checkpoints, the Court in Sitz stated it would not
“transfer from politically accountable ofﬁcials to the courts the decision as
to which among reasonable alternative law enforcement techniques should
be employed to deal with a serious public danger.”22 It went on to conclude
that “for purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis, the choice among such
reasonable alternatives remains with thegovernmental ofﬁcials who have a
unique understanding of, and a responsibility for, limited public resources,
including a ﬁnite number of police ofﬁcers.”23
While this language appears to leave quite a bit up to police discre-
tion, it also endorses two signiﬁcant limitations on that discretion. First,
courts are not left out of the picture entirely. They are still permitted to
intervene when the alternative chosen by the police is not reasonable.
This overview role accords with the dictates of political process theory
discussed in chapter 2; unless a legislature has authorized the surveillance
and provided fairly precise parameters for executive ofﬁcials, courts should
be involved in supervising the decision-making process. The generalized
suspicion concept can help courts determine whether police decisions are
reasonable.

Second, Sitz makes clear that the police who make the frontline decision
should not be the cop on the beat but politically accountable ofﬁcials who
have “responsibility for limited public resources.” In other words, the chief
of the department ought to be in charge of making these decisions. That
conclusion makes sense, for a number of reasons. First, it is consonant
with the exigency principle, which, as chapter 2 explained, dictates that a
government ofﬁcial other than the executing ofﬁcers determine the rea-
sonableness of a search. Second, a high-level ofﬁcial is likely to have better
access to the relevant statistics. And third, lower-level ofﬁcers should not
be making decisions affecting the large number of people who would be
subject to public surveillance.24
All of these reasons, but especially the third, also might lead one to
query whether the public should be involved in decision making. The Court
has not speciﬁcally addressed this question. But William Stuntz has argued
that Sitz stands for the proposition that the public should be directly in-
volved in such cases.25 More speciﬁcally, he posits that Sitz indicates that
the Court is willing to abandon the individualized suspicion model of the
Fourth Amendment in favor of what he calls a “politics model” when
searches or seizures affect large groups of people, because a group, unlike
the solitary suspect who is usually the target of searches and seizures, can
“throw the rascals out” if it does not like a particular technique.26
If Professor Stuntz is right about the Court’s underlying motivation in
Sitz, the practical problem becomes how to implement this politics model.
The typical electoral process, which is likely to revolve around many is-
sues, is not an effective way for the group to make its attitudes toward
a particular police action known. A more satisfactory implementation of
the model would be to require direct input on the establishment of cam-
era systems from those who will enjoy the beneﬁt and bear the brunt of
the surveillance. Such input can also provide the police with information
about speciﬁc crime problems and the type of surveillance that might prove
most useful.27 It is instructive that several participants at the International
Association of Chiefs of Police meeting on CCTV were adamant about
involving the affected community in decisions involving cameras.28
The American Bar Association’s Standards on Technologically-
Assisted Physical Surveillance address all these concerns about the deci-
sion to install cameras. They state that CCTV “is permissible when a polit-
ically accountable governmental authority concludes that the surveillance
will not view a private activity or condition and will be reasonably likely
to achieve a legitimate law enforcement objective.”29 The latter phrase

is deﬁned to require “articulable reasons” for concluding that the surveil-
lance will lead to the detection, deterrence, or prevention of crime,30 which,
after Edmond, should usually require a demonstration that a signiﬁcant
violent crime problem will be addressed by the surveillance. The ABA
Standards also require that “where deterrence rather than investigation
is the primary objective, the public to be affected by the surveillance . . .
[should have] the opportunity, both prior to the initiation of the surveil-
lance and periodically during it, to express its views of the surveillance
and propose changes in its execution, through a hearing or some other
appropriate means.”31 These are the kinds of general guidelines the courts
can fashion based on Fourth Amendment principles.
A second method of protecting the right to anonymity in public spaces
is technological rather than legal. The “Respectful Cameras” project at
the University of California is developing a method of obscuring the faces
of everyone within the camera’s scope with an opaque oval.32 Using this
innovation, cameras could conceivably be set up everywhere without in-
fringing public anonymity; operators could be told not to remove the tech-
nological mask unless and until the requisite suspicion, as discussed in the
next section, develops. It remains to be seen, however, whether a program
that blocks only faces protects anonymity and whether covering visages
undermines camera operators’ ability to detect criminal activity.
Justifying Individualization of Surveillance
If the Edmond standard is met for a particular area, then CCTV cameras
can be installed there consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Randomly
panning the camera to scan the streets ought to be permissible on the
same showing, just as the brief initial stops in Martinez-Fuerte and Sitz
were permitted without individualized suspicion. But what if the camera
operators want to record or closely observe a particular person’s actions,
using zoom capacity or via prolonged or repeated surveillance? The only
comprehensive study of CCTV operator behavior found that this scenario
occurs frequently. In approximately six hundred hours of observation, al-
most nine hundred “targeted surveillances” of more than a minute oc-
curred, with roughly one-third lasting between two and six minutes, and
one-quarter lasting longer than six minutes.33
Here again, the roadblock cases, supplemented by proportionality anal-
ysis, lead the way. In Sitz, the Court cautioned that it was addressing “only
the initial stop of each motorist passing through a checkpoint and the

associated preliminary questioning and observation by checkpoint ofﬁ-
cers. Detention of particular motorists for more extensive ﬁeld sobriety
testing may require satisfaction of an individualized suspicion standard.”34
Similarly, in Martinez-Fuerte, the Court felt it important to note that the
percentage of illegal immigrants discovered at the “secondary checkpoint”
to which motorists were sent after the initial stop was close to 20 percent,35
a ﬁgure that demonstrates a relatively high level of suspicion associated
with this seizure, which amounted to a ﬁve-minute document check.36
These cases suggest that something more than an inchoate hunch ought
to form the basis for intense scrutiny of individuals. Certainly use of audio
capacity to eavesdrop on private conversations on the street ought to be
based on individualized suspicion, presumably at the probable cause level.
Likewise, if the camera is used to intrude into the interior of the home,
probable cause should be required.
Short of these two situations, determining precisely when surveillance
progresses from random scanning or casual surveillance to observation
intense enough to warrant individualized suspicion may be difﬁcult. But
it will not be any more difﬁcult than deﬁning when a nonseizure becomes
a seizure, or determining when a stop requiring reasonable suspicion be-
comes an arrest requiring probable cause, issues with which the Supreme
Court has grappled on several occasions. Two factors that ought to be
relevant here, according to the ABA Standards, are “the extent to which
the surveillance technology enhances the law enforcement ofﬁcer’s natural
senses” and “the extent to which the surveillance of subjects is minimized
in time and space.”37 If the camera’s zoom or recording capacity allows op-
erators to obtain information that would be difﬁcult for an observer on the
street to discern (such as a title on a book cover or a biometric match with
ofﬁcial records), then reasonable suspicion ought to be required; the same
standard ought to be met if the cameras intentionally follow an individual
for a prolonged period of time (say, more than the ﬁve minutes involved
at the secondary checkpoint in Martinez-Fuerte) or on several separate
occasions (analogous to Rehnquist’s bar example described in chapter
4). Even a targeted surveillance lasting only a minute should require an
articulated reason beyond mere curiosity (such as a signal from one of
the automated systems described in the previous chapter). The amount of
individualized scrutiny permitted should be roughly proportionate to the
amount of individualized suspicion the government has developed.

mentrequires,giventheCourt’sdecisionin Knottspermittingsuspicionless

trackingofpublicmovementsusingabeeper.Butthebeeperin Knotts indi-
cated only the location of an object or person; video surveillance provides
government with much more. More important, unlike the beeper, CCTV
is overt, and thus it generates a much greater panoptic effect.
In any event, the fact that beeper use is covert and reveals only the
whereabouts of an individual should not necessarily suggest that all such
monitoring is exempt from constitutional strictures. Over a prolonged pe-
riod of time, this type of tracking can reveal an enormous amount of infor-
mation about an individual—in particular, whom or where he or she visits
and for how long—much more economically and conveniently than mere
visual surveillance. Note also that according to the table in chapter 4, using
a beeper to monitor travel for three days was rated as almost as intrusive
as a frisk, suggesting that members of the public believe that prolonged
tracking with a beeper is a signiﬁcant invasion. Had the tracking in Knotts
been longer (in fact, it lasted only about an hour and revealed only that
the driver had visited one location),38 a different result might have been
warranted, as several commentators have suggested.39
II. Execution Issues
A search or seizure must not only be justiﬁed but be executed in a rea-
sonable manner. Based on the Court’s case law, three execution issues
associated with CCTV might rise to the constitutional level. They concern
notice of the surveillance, the types of individuals to be observed, and
termination of the surveillance.
Notice
If the point of CCTV is deterrence, as its advocates claim, then notiﬁca-
tion of those subject to camera surveillance is imperative. Independent of
this government interest, the Fourth Amendment also imposes a notice
requirement. One of the primary reasons the Court gave in Martinez-
Fuerte for ﬁnding the intrusion associated with the roadblocks in that
case “minimal” was that, given the signs announcing the existence of the
roadblocks, motorists were “not taken by surprise”; further, because of
this notiﬁcation, they knew, or could “obtain knowledge of, the location
of the checkpoints” and would “not be stopped elsewhere.”40 The Court
also stated that the intrusion was further minimized because the check-

points appeared to be “duly authorized,”41 another function signs can
carry out.
OtherCourtdecisionsupholdingsuspicionlessgovernmentactionshave
reafﬁrmed that notice is an important means of meeting Fourth Amend-
ment requirements. For instance, in Von Raab v. United States, the case
involving drug testing of people who applied and worked for the cus-
toms service, the Court emphasized that “employees are . . . notiﬁed in
advance of the scheduled sample collection, thus reducing to a minimum
any ‘unsettling show of authority’ that may be associated with unexpected
intrusions on privacy.”42 In Wyman v. James, in which the Court permitted
suspicionless inspections of a welfare recipient’s home, the Court reasoned
that advance notice of the inspection minimized the intrusion on privacy
occasioned by the visit.43
A number of Court cases also suggest that suspicionless searches are
more palatable when the targets “consent” to them ahead of time, which is
impossible without some sort of notice.44 Of course, as already suggested,
the notion that people consent to public surveillance simply because they
proceed with their business after having been notiﬁed that cameras are
present is disingenuous at best. Consent implies that realistic alternatives
exist, which is simply not true in places like London, where cameras are
trained on almost every foot of public space. The purpose of notice in this
context is not to obtain consent but purely to alert passersby that they are
being watched so that they can act accordingly.
Avoiding Discriminatory Surveillance
The second execution issue of possible constitutional signiﬁcance arises
when government uses cameras to monitor only some of those who can jus-
tiﬁably be observed. Because no suspicion is required for camera surveil-
lance as it is practiced today, signiﬁcant potential for discrimination exists.
Indeed, research in the United Kingdom indicates that bias against minor-
ity groups is widespread among camera operators. Norris and Armstrong
report, for instance, that the CCTV practices they observed involved a
“massively disproportionate targeting of young males, particularly if they
are black or visibly identiﬁable as having subcultural afﬁliations.”45 This
differentiation, they concluded, was “not based on objective behavioural
and individualised criteria, but merely on being categorised as part of a
particular social group.”46
In the regime proposed here, discretionary targeting is reduced con-

siderably because some degree of suspicion is required for any prolonged
surveillance. But those who operate the cameras might still use race as
a criterion for selecting from among those for whom the requisite sus-
picion exists. Such practices are probably unconstitutional. In Whren v.
United States, for instance, the Supreme Court signaled that searches and
seizures resulting from intentional racial discrimination could violate the
Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.47 Although proof of
such intent is notoriously difﬁcult, every step possible should be taken to
ensure that, in the words of the ABA Standards, targets are not selected
“in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner.”48
Termination of the Surveillance
The ﬁnal execution issue that might trigger constitutional analysis concerns
the termination of individual surveillance. The Supreme Court has fre-
quentlyemphasized,inawaythatisconsistentwithproportionalityreason-
ing, the importance of durational limitations. In upholding the checkpoints
in Martinez-Fuerte, for instance, the Court pointed out that the initial stop
was extremely brief and that the secondary documentary check lasted only
about ﬁve minutes.49 In Sitz as well it found the initial stop, which averaged
twenty-ﬁve seconds, to be a “minimal” intrusion, as “measured by the du-
ration of the seizure and the intensity of the investigation.”50 The Court has
also indicated, in United States v. Sharpe, that stops based on reasonable
suspicion should not last much longer than ﬁve minutes in the absence of
extenuating circumstances such as delays caused by the target.51
When it comes to CCTV, these cases suggest that, in the ABA’s lan-
guage, the “surveillance should be limited to its authorized objectives and
be terminated when those objectives are achieved.”52 And, for regulatory
bodies so inclined, these cases could be mined for even more speciﬁc guide-
lines. Parallel to Martinez-Fuerte and Sitz, and consistent with the discus-
sion concerning individualization of surveillance, camera operators could
be required to terminate targeted surveillance of a particular individual
after a minute or so, unless reasonable suspicion develops.53 In cases where
such suspicion develops they could be required, parallel to Sharpe, to cease
surveillance if probable cause doesn’t develop within the next ﬁve to ten
minutes, unless extenuating circumstances are present. These rules would
have signiﬁcant impact, since research indicates that CCTV surveillance
can last well over ﬁve minutes even in cases where no deployment or arrest
results.54

Storage and Dissemination of Recordings
A principal feature of CCTV that distinguishes it from ordinary, nontech-
nological surveillance is the capacity to record observations. That capacity,
plus the potential for abuse of the information so generated, is apparently
of major concern to the public. The British survey quoted in chapter 4
indicated that many of the people questioned were very worried about
misuse of the images recorded on CCTV, an anxiety that is well founded,
given the fact that tapes showing people in compromising situations have
been publicly released in the United Kingdom on several occasions.55 In
my study as well, the scenario in which the tapes are not destroyed and
instead are made available to the media and other government agencies
“as needed” received a much higher intrusiveness rating (M = 73) than the
scenario in which tapes are destroyed within ninety-six hours (M = 53).
Indeed, the former rating is statistically indistinguishable from the ratings
associated with the search of a bedroom, an action that requires probable
cause.
The Supreme Court has never addressed this particular type of privacy
invasion as a Fourth Amendment matter. The closest it has come was in
Wilson v. Layne,56 where it held that the Fourth Amendment was violated
by a “media ride-along” in which a newspaper reporter and photographer
accompanied police on a search of a house. There, however, the issue was
solely whether the presence of the media at the time of the search was
unconstitutional; because the ride-along was not “in aid” of the search’s
execution, it unconstitutionally infringed on the privacy of the search’s
target.57 Layne did not address the lawfulness of later dissemination of
information about the search, whether acquired by the media at the time it
occursorfrompoliceatsomelaterpoint.IntheCCTVcontext,then,Layne
at most would ban the media and other non-law-enforcement entities from
being present during the surveillance.
Other Supreme Court decisions, however, suggest the Constitution re-
quires law enforcement to keep a tight rein on information it accumulates.

challenge to a state statute that required physicians to submit information
about patients’ drug use to a state agency. Although the Court upheld the
statute, it made much of the state’s efforts to maintain security over the
information submitted and the fact that the records were destroyed after
ﬁve years.59 At the end of its opinion, it also noted “the threat to privacy

computerized data banks or other massive government ﬁles” and stated
that “in some circumstances” a “duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures . . .
arguably has its roots in the Constitution.”60 Citing Whalen, the Court in
Ferguson v. City of Charleston concluded that “the reasonable expectation
of privacy enjoyed by the typical patient undergoing diagnostic tests in a
hospital is that the results of those tests will not be shared with nonmed-
ical personnel without her consent.”61 Also relying on Whalen, the Court
in Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press
stated that “the fact that an event is not wholly ‘private’ does not mean
that an individual has no interest in limiting disclosure or dissemination of
the information.”62 That case went on to hold that under the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA), government-maintained rap sheets on criminals
need not be disclosed to the press because they did not further the FOIA’s
“central purpose” of exposing to public scrutiny ofﬁcial information that
sheds light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties.63
These cases indicate that the Court is willing to interpret the Consti-
tution and statutory mandates to circumscribe disclosure of private infor-
mation gathered by the government. In the CCTV setting, the content
of these rules might vary widely. With respect to storage of information,
a jurisdiction might require that all recordings not relevant to a criminal
investigation be destroyed within a short period of time (the ninety-six-
hour limitation used in the survey reported in chapter 4 comes from Bal-
timore’s policy).64 Or it could opt for a much longer maintenance period,
in the belief that the usefulness of particular tapes, either to inculpate or
exculpate, may not become apparent until signiﬁcant time has elapsed. The
important feature here is to ensure the security of the recordings. With re-
spect to dissemination, the Court’s cases suggest that allowing information
to be used for non-law-enforcement purposes ought to be permitted only
under compelling circumstances, if at all. The ABA Standards recommend
that “disclosures be prohibited unless afﬁrmatively authorized by statute,
judicial decision, or agency rule.”65 That language echoes the Sitz mandate
that decisions affecting large segments of the public be left to politically
accountable ofﬁcials.
Before leaving this subject, mention must be made of a provocative pro-
posal from Professor Stuntz. I have argued here that in addition to rules
regarding disclosure, we need rules concerning justiﬁcation and implemen-
tation. Stuntz suggests that when government engages in “secret searches,”
we might proﬁtably consider focusing solely on disclosure rules.66 More
speciﬁcally, he proposes that government be allowed to carry out such

searches randomly, without having to demonstrate any suspicion, on con-
dition that the information thus obtained be used only in prosecutions
for serious, violent crimes. That approach, he asserts, “would allow us to
give both the police and private citizens more of what they value—easier
evidence-gathering and reduced risk of embarrassment or harassment.”67
Although CCTV, as deﬁned for purposes of this discussion, is not con-
ducted secretly, it could be. For instance, a CCTV system in Hull, England,
uses “tiny cameras disguised in street lamps or concealed on buildings to
transmit pictures to a monitoring center around the clock.”68 Stuntz would
allow such covert use at the whim of the police so long as his limited
disclosure rule is followed. People would not know that their right to
anonymity had been invaded unless and until they are prosecuted for a
serious crime. Why not institute this regime rather than bother with the
elaborate justiﬁcation rules discussed to this point?
One concern raised by Stuntz’s proposal focuses on whether govern-
ment can be trusted to limit its use of the information it obtains through
covert CCTV to prosecutions of serious crimes. Given the secret nature
of these searches, ﬁnding the “poisonous tree” in prosecutions for non-
serious offenses may be difﬁcult. Furthermore, of course, barring use of
surveillance results in court does not provide any disincentive to police
who intend to use CCTV feeds solely to harass “ﬂawed consumers” or
take other actions they know will not lead to charges being ﬁled.
The more important problem with the elimination of justiﬁcation and
execution rules, however, has to do with the right to anonymity. Stuntz’s
proposal might not openly infringe that right for those not prosecuted,
but it insidiously trenches on everyone’s right to avoid suspicionless gov-
ernment scrutiny. Indeed, in the CCTV context, once the public becomes
aware that random covert surveillance is occurring, as it inevitably would
after a few prosecutions in which the covertly gleaned information is used,
the panoptic effect of this regime will be greater than occurs with overt
CCTV. The survey results reported in the previous chapter may appear to
suggest otherwise, because the covert camera scenario ranked signiﬁcantly
lower than the overt scenario (albeit still signiﬁcantly higher than the road-
block). However, the covert scenario used in the survey implied that the
surveillance was limited to one location.69 In Stuntz’s society, by contrast,
we would assume that secret surveillance was pervasive, not just incidental.
That would move us one step closer to an Orwellian society, because we
would no longer know when and where government is attempting to ﬁnd
out what we are doing in public; in other words, we would not know when

or how to protect against invasion of our public anonymity. Probably no
passage in Orwell’s 1984 is more chilling than the one partially excerpted
at the beginning of chapter 4: “There was of course no way of knowing
whether you were being watched at any given moment. . . . It was even
conceivable that they watched everybody all the time.”70
III. Accountability
Unless we know precisely when publicly placed cameras are being used to
watch us, for how long, and with what level of justiﬁcation, enforcement
of the rules described above is not possible. Even if this information is
available, reliance on the police to hold themselves accountable for a vio-
lation of the rules, which is the current approach, is unlikely to ensure full
compliance.Finally,evengoodfaitheffortsatfullcompliancewiththerules
will not achieve their ultimate goal so long as people still feel signiﬁcant
panoptic effects. All three of these concerns deserve some attention.
Watching the Watchers
The rules concerning individualization, discrimination, and termination
comprise what could be called “conduct of surveillance” rules, since they
have to do with the actual operation of the cameras. Ensuring account-
ability depends ﬁrst on ﬁguring out whether these conduct rules are being
followed. How can we know when camera operators are scrutinizing a
particular individual for a prolonged period of time despite a lack of artic-
ulable suspicion? How do we make sure that the police refrain from using
cameras in a discriminatory fashion?
Self-reports probably will not work. Operators may not even recognize
their discriminatory practices, and if they did, they are hardly likely to con-
fess them. Furthermore, suspicion about targets of surveillance is always
easy to manufacture in hindsight if the searcher has control of the facts.71
As the ABA Standards admonish, police must develop “administrative
rules which ensure that the information necessary for . . . accountability
exists,”72 a sentiment that is not inconsistent with Fourth Amendment
tenets, which at the least are violated when the police conceal information
relevant to determining the validity of a search.73
How might we ensure access to the information necessary for account-
ability? David Brin has argued that the best way to control the govern-

ment (and everyone else) in a surveillance-happy “transparent society”
is to watch the watchers.74 That idea could be implemented in the CCTV
context in at least two ways. Camera tapes could be audited periodically
and randomly by independent reviewers to determine whether operators
are violating any of the rules. Or the watchers really could be watched,
by cameras. That method would not only capture the facts necessary to
determine whether conduct of surveillance standards are obeyed, but also
bring home to operators the panoptic effects their surveillance has on oth-
ers, thus perhaps curbing voyeuristic and other unnecessary observation.
Assuring Compliance
Assuming a violation is discovered, what should be done? As noted in the
previous chapter, police favor voluntary guidelines, by which they appear
to mean rules that they not only develop but also enforce. But police
are reluctant to punish their own for violations that involve balancing
abstract concepts like privacy against law enforcement needs.75 Some other
accountability mechanism is necessary.
In the Fourth Amendment context, that mechanism has usually been
exclusion of illegally obtained evidence.76 Certainly that sanction should
be invoked when it applies. But it is unlikely to be a potent deterrent in
connection with the types of rules at issue here, for a number of reasons.
Take ﬁrst the rules concerning individualization, discrimination, and
termination—the conduct-of-surveillance rules. The most important rea-
son exclusion does not do a good job encouraging compliance with these
types of rules is that the vast majority of people subject to camera surveil-
lance, and therefore most people whose activities are observed in violation
of the rules, will never be prosecuted, either because they are completely
innocent or because they commit infractions that are taken care of on
the street. According to one study conducted in the United Kingdom, for
instance, more than three-quarters of those stopped by police as a result
of camera surveillance receive no more than a warning, and only just over
1 percent are arrested.77 In short, most violations of the right to public
anonymity will not be redressed through exclusion. That is not a good
prescription for ensuring deterrence.
Moreover, when police do want to prosecute crimes illicitly discovered
through camera surveillance, they will frequently be able to avoid exclu-
sion. First, exclusion may not be required if the ﬁeld ofﬁcer who makes
an arrest based on information from a camera operator acts in a good

faith belief that no rules were violated by the operator.78 Second, police
know that if they can track down eyewitnesses, through the camera tapes
or otherwise, the eyewitness’s testimony will usually be admissible even
if the testimony of the camera operator and ﬁeld ofﬁcer is tainted by ille-
gal surveillance.79 Only if the prosecution of crimes were barred outright
whenever they are discovered through a violation of CCTV rules would
the threat of exclusion pose a serious deterrent. But even then, resourceful
operators can hide the poisonous tree through untracked calls to a ﬁeld
ofﬁcer.
As a supplement to exclusion, a more direct sanction is necessary when
conduct-of-surveillance rules are violated. In theory, criminal sanctions,
damages actions, and administrative penalties are far superior to exclu-
sion because they would not be dependent on whether prosecution—or
indeed on whether any government action at all—is based on surveillance
results. Criminal prosecutions would probably be considered too draco-
nian or too difﬁcult to bring, however.80 And given the many limitations
on constitutional damage actions that have been imposed by the courts,
that method of deterring violations would not work well either, at least
as it is currently structured.81 The best sanctioning system, developed in
more detail in chapter 8, may well be an administrative penalty, such as a
suspension or a dock in pay, that is sought by an entity independent of the
police and enforced by the courts.
The other three rules proposed above address camera placement, no-
tice of camera placement, and disclosure of recordings. Here again the
exclusionary sanction is not a particularly good ﬁt. If the placement or
notice rules are violated, exclusion of all evidence garnered through the
subsequent surveillance would be overkill, at least if the other rules are
followed, and in any event would not necessarily stop surveillance aimed
at “ﬂawed consumers.” And unlawful disclosure to non-law-enforcement
entities does not even involve a proceeding at which evidence can be ex-
cluded. For violation of placement or notice rules, the better remedy would
be an injunction ordering installation to desist or notice to be provided,
which courts could grant when politically accountable ofﬁcials fail to pro-
vide a reasonable explanation for their decisions on these matters.82 With
respect to impermissible disclosure of recordings, damages remedies are a
perfect ﬁt, given the tort-like harm incurred,83 although judicially backed
administrative sanctions are probably necessary as well.

Beyond Sanctions: Accountability through Information
Will any of this do any good? After all, cameras will still be lawfully in-
stalled in some locations. In those areas, won’t people still feel watched,
regardless of whether the conduct-of-surveillance and disclosure rules are
followed? If so, why bother with any of these rules?
These are good questions. At most, the panoptic effects of lawfully
placed cameras can only be mitigated, not eliminated. To maximize mit-
igation, the conduct-of-surveillance rules should be promulgated widely,
andanysanctionsimposedasaresultoftheirviolationshouldbepublicized
as well.
Two other proposals, both recommended by the ABA, are worth con-
sideration. First, “periodic review by law enforcement agencies of the
scope and effectiveness of technologically-assisted physical surveillance”
ought to occur.84 Second, the government should “maintain[ ] and [make]
available to the public general information about the type or types of
surveillance being used and the frequency of their use.”85 Right now, most
police departments take neither of these steps. That should be rectiﬁed.
Periodic internal review would ensure that the government pays attention
to whether the cameras are achieving the crime reduction goal it seeks and
might even result in the disassembly of some cameras. Review would also
provide information about the nature, frequency, and success of camera
surveillance that could be disseminated to the public, which could then
reach its own conclusions about the scope of surveillance.
Ideally, dissemination of information about CCTV that is conducted
under the rules proposed here will lead to the realization that most of
us are of no interest to camera operators. Fear that our public actions,
or images of those actions, will be scrutinized by faceless bureaucrats or
government agents with a suspect agenda should be allayed. Similar to the
apparent impact of Title III’s imposition of strict judicial control over and
disclosure of government wiretapping and bugging practices,86 we should
be able to rest assured that camera operators will not watch us simply
because they can.
The constitutional basis for these review and publication rules is again
the Fourth Amendment. As chapter 2 noted, that amendment guarantees a
right to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures.87 Knowledge
that government has enacted rules limiting its surveillance powers, that
the rules are being enforced, and that periodic reports on the implemen-
tation and success of the surveillance will be made public is the surest way

to enhance a sense of security in an age when technology threatens our
anonymity.
Conclusion
The fundamental question addressed in this chapter and the previous one
is whether government use of cameras to observe the public activities of its
citizens is a concern of constitutional dimension. CCTV might implicate
several constitutional doctrines, among them the First Amendment, the
right to freedom of movement, and the general right to privacy. But if one
provision has to be selected as a constitutional basis for regulating this type
of surveillance, it should probably be the Fourth Amendment, the primary
source of limitations on police investigative techniques.
Admittedly, the Supreme Court’s Fourth Amendment case law does
not form a solid basis for the conclusion that CCTV constitutes a search
or seizure. Yet as a linguistic matter, once camera operators shift from
scanning crowds to targeting individuals, they are certainly engaging in a
search, even the narrowest deﬁnition of which involves looking “into or
over carefully or thoroughly in an effort to ﬁnd or discover something.” A
less literal reading of the Fourth Amendment’s threshold should lead even
more readily to the same result. Whether framed in the Court’s language—
in terms of expectations of privacy society is prepared to recognize as
reasonable—or in mine—in terms of a right to anonymity that protects
against unnecessary government scrutiny—that threshold is crossed when
government trains cameras on its citizens, because of the panoptic atmo-
spheresuchsurveillancecreates,anatmospherethattheempiricalresearch
reported here suggests is more intrusive than many other government ac-
tions that are clearly governed by the Fourth Amendment. If the federal
constitution cannot be read to place restrictions on CCTV, then state con-
stitutions, which are less encumbered with negative precedent, should be
so construed.88
The same approach should be taken toward other types of government
spying on public activities, whether they involve global positioning de-
vices, satellite cameras, radio frequency identiﬁcation, or handheld detec-
tion devices. Regulation of these surveillance practices is crucial to ensure
that government intrusion into our lives does not grow with technologi-
cal developments. “Dragnet law enforcement practices,” to use Knotts’s
terminology, should be the province of the Fourth Amendment.

Subpoenas and Privacy
W
e turn now from physical surveillance—the real-time visual obser-
vation of our activities—to transaction surveillance—the accessing
of records about activities that have already occurred. In terms of volume,
transaction surveillance dwarfs physical surveillance. The recent revela-
tions about the National Security Agency’s designs on the phone logs of
millions of American citizens and the government’s efforts to obtain hun-
dreds of thousands of bank and credit records, both programs commenced
at least as far back as September 2001, provide a dramatic illustration of
the point.1 Outside the national security context as well, government in-
vestigators are constantly and routinely seeking access to digital and hard
copy documents.
Many of the documents obtained through transaction surveillance, par-
ticularly those sought in connection with regulatory investigations, de-
scribe the transactions of corporations and other businesses. But a sig-
niﬁcant proportion of these records contain more personal information.
Housed in private businesses, government agencies, and other institutions,
they include reports on our medical status and ﬁnancial condition; data
about our purchases, rentals, real estate holdings, licenses, and member-
ships; logs listing the destination of our e-mails, our Internet wanderings,
and phone calls; and countless other bits of individual descriptors, ranging
from salary levels to college grades to driver’s license numbers. These
records can sometimes be obtained directly, using snoopware or arrange-
ments with service providers such as AT&T, Verizon, and America Online,
or indirectly, through commercial data brokers for a price.
Whether the records memorialize our own version of personal activities
or are created by the recordholder itself, they usually come into existence
on the explicit or implicit understanding that the information they contain

otherwords,weconsiderthecontentsofmostoftheserecordsprivatevis-à-
vis most of the world. Thus, one might assume that the Fourth Amendment,
which is meant to protect “reasonable expectations of privacy” in “papers”
as well as houses, persons, and effects, applies here with full force.
Yet that is not the case. Law enforcement ofﬁcials can, perfectly legally,
gain access to all these records much more easily than they can search our
houses or even our cars. While the latter types of actions require probable
cause, government can obtain many of the records just described simply
by asking (or paying) for them. And, at most, all the government needs
to show in order to get any of these records is that they are relevant to a
government investigation—a much lower, and much more diffuse, level of
justiﬁcation than probable cause.
This state of affairs might make sense when the records sought are truly
public in nature. It might also be justiﬁable when the records involve an
entity such as a corporation, professional service provider, or government
department and are sought in an effort to investigate the entity and its
members. But today, facilitated by the computerization of information
and communication, government routinely obtains individual medical, ﬁ-
nancial, and e-mail records in connection with investigations that have
nothing to do with business or governmental corruption. That practice is
much more questionable.
To understand why this practice persists, one has to understand the
subpoena, because it is the primary mechanism for acquiring records. A
subpoena is a formal demand for tangible items and traditionally has come
inoneoftwoforms(althoughrecentlyotherversionshavesprungup).Sub-
poenas duces tecum are controlled by the grand jury or the prosecutor, with
the courts determining their validity when they are resisted by the target.2
Administrative subpoenas or summonses are issued by government agen-
cies, such as the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Trade Commission,
and the Department of Justice, and are also enforced by the courts.3
Although both types of subpoenas can be challenged by the recipient
before any documents are handed over,4 both are also extremely easy
to enforce. There are essentially three grounds for resisting a subpoena:
privilege, burdensomeness, and irrelevance. A successful privilege claim is
rare; as explained in some detail later in this chapter, the Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination is usually unavailable and the attorney-
client privilege is coextensive with that privilege. Objections that the task
of assembling the records demanded by a subpoena is too burdensome or

expensive are also, in the words of a leading criminal procedure text, “al-
most always doomed to failure.”5 And an irrelevance challenge is usually
equally unavailing. In the federal grand jury context, for instance, subpoe-
nas are quashed as irrelevant only when “there is no reasonable possibility
that the category of materials the government seeks will produce infor-
mation relevant to the general subject of the grand jury’s investigation.”6
The relevancy standard in the administrative subpoena context is simi-
larly lax. The Supreme Court has indicated that constitutional requisites
are met even when a subpoena seeks to satisfy “nothing more than ofﬁcial
curiosity,”7 and some lower courts have concluded that the standard is
even more deferential than the “arbitrary and capricious” test applied in
administrative law cases.8
No nationwide tally of the extent to which law enforcement uses doc-
ument subpoenas exists. But the federal government alone issues thou-
sands of such subpoenas every year.9 As noted above, today subpoenas and
pseudo-subpoenas are routinely used to obtain not only business records
and the like but also documents containing signiﬁcant amounts of personal
informationaboutindividuals,informationthatcanbeextremelyrevealing.
For instance, a subpoena is the only authorization the federal government
needs to obtain medical and ﬁnancial records. The contents of “stored”
e-mail messages and phone company and Internet service provider (ISP)
logs can also be acquired pursuant to a subpoena. And other types of
information—ranging from the phone numbers and e-mail addresses one
contacts, to the contents of records kept by government agencies—can be
obtained simply upon the certiﬁcation of a law enforcement ofﬁcial that
the information will be useful to a government investigation.
Thus, as an investigative tool and as a means of discovering ostensibly
private facts, subpoenas and their progeny are far more important than
physical searches of homes, businesses, and effects. Yet very little literature
on the history or rationale of the subpoena exists. This chapter helps ﬁll that
void, as a predicate for chapter 7’s detailed discussion of current subpoena
law and how it should be reformed.
Section 1 of this chapter looks at the history of the subpoena in an at-
tempt to understand how the currently lax approach to transaction surveil-
lance developed. An important, and surprising, part of the story is that
throughout the nineteenth century, courts looked to the Fifth Amendment,
not the Fourth Amendment, in analyzing the validity of subpoenas; fur-
thermore, most courts held that the Fifth Amendment’s injunction against
compelling a person to testify against himself or herself prohibited, not

merely limited, government attempts to obtain incriminating documents
from a suspect. Late in the nineteenth century the Supreme Court ex-
panded on this notion by holding that such compulsion violated the Fifth
Amendment and the Fourth Amendment’s restriction on unreasonable
searches and seizures.
At the turn of the twentieth century, however, the Court appeared
to reverse itself, removing virtually all Fourth Amendment strictures on
document subpoenas and, when the documents were corporate in nature,
eliminating Fifth Amendment limitations as well. This dramatic shift in the
Court’s posture was reﬁned during the ﬁrst three quarters of the twentieth
century and remains good law today. The point emphasized in section 1 of
this chapter, however, is that the Court’s pre-1975 deregulation of subpoe-
nas came in cases involving government attempts to regulate businesses;
not a single one of them involved searches of personal papers. Because,
as far as the Court was concerned, personal records held by the target of
the subpoena—in those days, most personal records—remained protected
by the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition on compelled testimony, the virtual
elimination of Fourth Amendment protection against subpoenas had no
impact in that area.
Two relatively recent developments, also described in section 1, have
changed all that. First, within the past three decades, the Supreme Court
has radically altered its approach to the Fifth Amendment privilege: today,
personal records held by the target are, in the run-of-the-mill case, almost
as unprotected as corporate records as far as that constitutional provision is
concerned. Far more important, the modernization of society has rendered
the Fifth Amendment’s application to personal records largely irrelevant
in any event. Today, in contrast to the nineteenth century, most of our
personal information is recorded and held by third parties. When third
parties are ordered to produce information via a subpoena, they cannot,
under any plausible interpretation of the Fifth Amendment, be said to be
incriminating themselves. Thus, when the government compels production
from a third-party recordholder—whether the recordholder is a hospital,
an ISP, or another government agency—it is not violating the target’s Fifth
Amendment right.
Since today most subpoenas for personal documents are aimed at third-
party recordholders, the upshot of these developments is that the govern-
ment is almost entirely unrestricted, by either the Fifth or Fourth Amend-
ment, in its efforts to obtain documentary evidence of crime. Section 2
of this chapter examines the various rationales for this regulatory regime.

More speciﬁcally, it identiﬁes six possible reasons why subpoenas need not
meet the probable cause standard even when aimed at obtaining personal
information, the ﬁrst and last of which apply to all subpoenas, and the rest
of which are relevant only to third-party subpoenas. The ﬁrst justiﬁcation,
offered by the Supreme Court more than a century ago, is that subpoenas
are not searches under the Fourth Amendment because they do not in-
volve physical intrusion. The second, put forward by the modern Court, is
that third-party subpoenas are not searches because the information they
seek is already exposed to others, and therefore they are not associated
with a reasonable expectation of privacy. The next three reasons are not as
clearly stated in Supreme Court opinions but are implicit in the Court’s lan-
guage or are found in lower court decisions: the records obtained through
third-party subpoenas belong to the third party, not the target; third-party
recordholders are no different from third-party witnesses who have infor-
mation about a suspect; and third parties have an obligation to provide
information to the government. The ﬁnal reason courts give for leaving
subpoenas essentially unregulated is also the most common: imposition
of rigorous Fourth Amendment requirements on subpoenas would stymie
important government investigations.
The conclusions that section 2 reaches with respect to these six ratio-
nales turn on the historical distinction between corporate and personal
records described in section 1. Many of the rationales for deregulating sub-
poenas are persuasive in the context that most commonly triggers the use
of subpoenas and in which constitutional subpoena law developed—the
investigation of corporate crime. But none of these rationales is convincing
when applied to demands for personal records.
Iftheseconclusionsarecorrect,thendistinguishingbetweenimpersonal
and personal records is important. That is the task of section 3. Ironically,
this part of the chapter borrows heavily from the Court’s old Fifth Amend-
ment jurisprudence, which justiﬁed protection of records based largely on
a desire to create a “zone of privacy.” The irony stems from the fact that
today, of course, the Fifth Amendment is not about privacy at all but rather
about coercion. The fact that the Court’s early Fifth Amendment decisions
were focused on protection of privacy suggests that if the Court of one
hundred years ago had known its Fifth Amendment jurisprudence would
be jettisoned, its Fourth Amendment jurisprudence might have been much
more protective of documentary evidence that is personal in nature.

I. A Constitutional History of Subpoenas
There are three legal processes for obtaining documents. The ﬁrst, of
course, is the search warrant, issued ex parte and executed by government
agents.10 The second is a subpoena ordering the person or entity whose
activities are described in the documents to produce them (a ﬁrst-party
or target subpoena). The third is a subpoena directing a person or entity
who is not a target of an investigation, but who happens to hold records
relevant to it, to produce them (a third-party subpoena).
Subpoenas are the preferred method of obtaining documents, primarily
because they are usually valid so long as the documents they demand are
relevanttoaninvestigation,amuchlowerstandardthantheprobablecause
required for a search warrant. The one supposed advantage a warrant has
over a ﬁrst-party subpoena is that it is executed when it is served and thus
can prevent destruction of evidence by an alerted suspect. But that threat
is minimal in most cases. Where business records are involved, document
destruction seldom occurs after receipt of a subpoena because the docu-
ments are needed to run the business and because so many people know
of their existence that obstruction of justice charges are a real possibility
if destruction occurs. Shredding of documents is a more likely response to
a ﬁrst-party subpoena aimed at an individual’s personal records, but even
here obstruction penalties tend to inhibit it.11
More important, personal information can usually be obtained via a
third-party subpoena, which of course eliminates the possibility that the
target will destroy the evidence. In many settings, this investigative move
also eliminates even the target’s ability to challenge the government’s ac-
tion, because he or she will not be told about it (a practice the Supreme
Court has upheld against Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amend-
ment challenges).12 The supposed advantage of a warrant over this type
of subpoena is that it will produce more or better records because the
third party may not have the information the government wants. But that
advantage is illusory in today’s world. Most aspects of our personal life that
have been reduced to writing or digitized are stored with some third party.
Volumes of data about us can be found in “public” records maintained by
the government, and even more data are deposited with hospitals, banks,
schools, stores, and ISPs. Under current law, all this information is just a
subpoena (or less) away. Thus it is not surprising that law enforcement
rarely resorts to a warrant to obtain documents and records.13
The following discussion explains how this regulatory regime devel-

oped. It begins with the constitutional law governing ﬁrst-party subpoenas
and then examines the law of third-party subpoenas.
Subpoenas Directed at the Target
The origin of the subpoena for documents can be traced back at least
to the reign of King Charles II in the late seventeenth century.14 But it
appears that these subpoenas were common only in civil litigation; even
at their inception, courts hesitated to allow their use in criminal cases. In
1748, the King’s Bench cited cases from 1703 and 1744 in emphasizing
that a court may not “make a man produce evidence against himself, in
a criminal prosecution.”15 A number of other eighteenth-century English
courts straightforwardly held that the government could never demand a
person’s books and papers in criminal cases.16 By the time the American
Constitution was drafted, the matter was well settled. As Richard Na-
gareda has noted, “All sources to address the point concur that common
law at the time of the Fifth Amendment barred the compelled production
of self-incriminatory documents.”17
American judicial decisions in the nineteenth century appeared to fol-
low English common law, although a few scattered courts did allow com-
pelled production in criminal and quasi-criminal cases.18 The issue prob-
ably did not arise that often in the United States, just as it was seldom
litigated in England.19 Documents sometimes could be obtained from a
source other than the suspect, which occasioned no Fifth Amendment
issue, and might also be obtained through a search based on a warrant. In
anyevent,streetcrimeusuallydidnotgeneratedocumentaryevidence,and
state regulation of business crimes—much more likely to trigger demands
for documents via subpoena—was in its infancy until late in the nineteenth
century.20
It was a regulatory case, involving nonpayment of taxes, that provided
the peak of constitutional protection for papers in the United States. The
case was Boyd v. United States,21 handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court
in 1886. Consistent with the early English common law, Boyd held that
using a subpoena to force an individual to produce private documents
violated the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition against compelled testimony.
But Justice Joseph P. Bradley’s opinion for the Court added a new twist to
the analysis, holding that such subpoenas also violated the Fourth Amend-
ment’s prescription against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court
came to this conclusion even though the defendant company was subject

only to civil sanctions (which undermines an argument based on the Fifth
Amendment’s prohibition of compelling testimony in criminal cases) and
even though the documents at issue in Boyd were not personal papers but
merely invoices used to prove fraudulent importation of goods (which are
hardly the types of intimate papers most closely associated with the privacy
interests the Fourth Amendment protects). Justice Bradley accorded these
objections little weight:22
The “unreasonable searches and seizures” condemned in the Fourth Amend-
ment are almost always made for the purpose of compelling a man to give
evidence against himself, which in criminal cases is condemned in the Fifth
Amendment; and compelling a man “in a criminal case to be a witness against
himself,” which is condemned in the Fifth Amendment, throws light on the
question as to what is an “unreasonable search and seizure” within the mean-
ing of the Fourth Amendment. And we have been unable to perceive that the
seizure of a man’s private books and papers to be used in evidence against him
is substantially different from compelling him to be a witness against himself.23
This strong afﬁrmation by the highest court in the land of what had pre-
viously been, in the United States at least, an ambiguous constitutional
protection for papers had potentially major repercussions. As William
Stuntz has noted, Boyd’s holding, if allowed to stand, would have seri-
ously undermined the modern regulatory state, which at that time was just
building up steam.24 Without the ability readily to obtain the records of
corporations, partnerships, and other entities, government agencies would
be frustrated in their efforts to ensure that corporate tax laws, bank laws,
securities laws, and a host of other regulatory statutes were enforced.
For precisely that reason, within twenty years the Court reversed itself.
In the 1906 case of Hale v. Henkel,25 the defendant corporation, suspected
of antitrust violations, relied on Boyd in arguing that a grand jury sub-
poena for its documents violated both the Fifth and Fourth Amendments.
In ﬁnding for the government, the Court rejected the interpretation of
the Fifth Amendment that it had adopted in Boyd and limited the Fourth
Amendment’s relevance in subpoena cases to a prohibition of overbroad
requests. Acceptance of the corporation’s Fifth Amendment claim, the
Court stated, “would practically nullify the whole act of Congress [that
outlawed monopolies]. Of what use would it be for the legislature to de-
clare these combinations unlawful if the judicial power may close the door
of access to every available source of information upon the subject?”26 For

similarreasons,theCourtheldthattheFourthAmendmentdidnotprevent
use of a subpoena duces tecum to compel the production of documentary
evidence. Quoting an English decision, the Court stated that “it would be
‘utterly impossible to carry on the administration of justice’ without this
writ.”27 At most, the Court indicated, the Fourth Amendment prohibits
a “general subpoena” that is “too sweeping,” a holding meant merely to
address the now largely moot concern that production of most or all of
a company’s papers would “completely put a stop to the business of that
company.”28
The move toward the current regime of virtually unlimited subpoena
power was not immediate, however. In FTC v. American Tobacco Co., de-
cided in 1924, a unanimous Court held that federal antitrust law required
the Federal Trade Commission to provide “some evidence of the materi-
ality of the papers demanded” by an administrative subpoena.29 Although
the holding was based on an interpretation of a statute, the Court, per
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, also stated that “anyone who respects the
spirit as well as the letter of the Fourth Amendment would be loath to be-
lieve that Congress intended to authorize one of its subordinate agencies
to sweep all our traditions into the ﬁre and to direct ﬁshing expeditions
into private papers.”30 Other Supreme Court and lower court cases exhib-
ited similar resistance to blind sanctioning of subpoenas administered by
agencies.31
By the mid-1940s, however, the Court had carried through to its log-
ical conclusion Hale’s assertion that signiﬁcant restrictions on the gov-
ernment’s subpoena power would unduly hamper regulatory investigative
efforts. In 1946, in Oklahoma Press Co. v. Walling, the Court canvassed
the relevant authorities and concluded that
the Fifth Amendment affords no protection by virtue of the self-incrimination
provision, whether for the corporation or for its ofﬁcers; and the Fourth, if appli-
cable, at the most guards against abuse only by way of too much indeﬁniteness or
breadth in the things required to be “particularly described,” if also the inquiry
is one the demanding agency is authorized by law to make and the materials
speciﬁed are relevant.32
Oklahoma Press even insinuated that a subpoena is not an “actual
search” meriting Fourth Amendment protection.33 Although this dictum
was glossed over four years later in United States v. Morton Salt Co., there
the Court adhered to the notion that “it is sufﬁcient if the inquiry is within

the authority of the agency, the demand is not too indeﬁnite and the in-
formation sought is reasonably relevant.”34 Indeed, “even if one were to
regard the request for information in this case as caused by nothing more
than ofﬁcial curiosity, nevertheless law enforcing agencies have a legiti-
mate right to satisfy themselves that corporate behavior is consistent with
the law and the public interest.”35 In United States v. Powell, decided in
1964, the Court reiterated that a government agency subpoena for records
is valid if the records are “relevant” to an investigation conducted for a
“legitimate purpose” (meaning one authorized by statute).36 As applied,
the Powell relevance standard is extremely easy to meet.37
What has seldom been noted, however, is that all these cases involved
government attempts to obtain corporate or other business documents.
Throughout the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, the Court had intimated
that subpoenas for private records might have to meet a higher standard.
For instance, in Hale the Court stated that “there is a clear distinction
between an individual and a corporation” in cases involving demands for
production of books and papers.38 Because a corporation “is a creature of
the State,” it “is presumed to be incorporated for the beneﬁt of the public,”
and it “receives certain special privileges and franchises, and holds them
subject to the laws of the State and the limitations of its charter.” But
an individual “owes no such duty to the State, since he receives nothing
therefrom, beyond the protection of his life and property.” Thus, in contrast
to the corporation, an individual retains the right to refuse “to incriminate
himself,andtheimmunityofhimselfandhispropertyfromarrestorseizure
except under a warrant of the law.”39
In the years following Hale, Supreme Court and lower court cases fre-
quently reiterated, albeit usually in dictum, that only corporate documents
could be obtained pursuant to subpoena; private documents continued to
be immune from compulsory process.40 Four decades later the Court was
still echoing these sentiments when, in Oklahoma Press, it characterized its
earlier cases authorizing production of documents pursuant to a subpoena
as applying “merely to the production of corporate records and papers.”41
Shortly thereafter, in Morton Salt, the Court simply stated that “corpora-
tions can claim no equality with individuals in the enjoyment of a right to
privacy.”42
In short, in the words of the Court’s majority opinion in Griswold v.
Connecticut, the Fifth Amendment created a “zone of privacy” around
personal papers.43 From our perspective in the twenty-ﬁrst century, the
Fourth Amendment seems a more appropriate source of law for estab-

lishing privacy zones. But Hale had emasculated the Fourth Amendment,
at least in the subpoena context.44 Thus, it was the Fifth Amendment or
nothing.
Eventually, it turned out to be nothing, at least for the last quarter
of the twentieth century. A signal of things to come was the perplexing
and seldom discussed opinion in Ryan v. United States.45 Decided in 1964
on the same day as Powell and a year before Griswold’s zone-of-privacy
dictum, Ryan blithely announced that the minimal Powell requirements
for administrative subpoenas aimed at corporations governed subpoenas
for individual tax records as well. The Court provided virtually no ex-
planation for this abrupt change in direction, merely stating that it had
reached its conclusion “for the reasons given in [Powell],”46 without any
further discussion. And Powell’s holding that probable cause need not be
demonstrated to obtain corporate tax records rested solely on an inter-
pretation of the relevant statutory language.47 The Powell opinion (and
therefore Ryan) did not mention the Fifth Amendment. Nor did it refer
to the Fourth Amendment, the ostensible basis of the petitioner’s claim
in Ryan.48 Thus, with one perfunctory statement that did not purport to
address constitutional concerns, the Court seemed to obliterate the sixty-
year-old distinction between corporate and personal records in connection
with the subpoena process.
Because of its opaqueness, however, Ryan left some doubt as to the
application of the Constitution to subpoenas. Indeed, in United States v.
Dionisio,49 decided nine years later, the Court seemed to have forgotten all
about Ryan. There, in the course of holding that voice exemplars are not
“testimony” under the Fifth Amendment, the Court continued to assert,
in apparent contrast with Ryan, that papers are testimony and that the
grand jury “cannot require the production by a person of private books
and records that would incriminate him,” citing Boyd.50 Although Dionisio
involved a grand jury subpoena whereas Ryan dealt with an administrative
summons, the demands for production in these cases were both pursuant
to law enforcement investigations and thus were functionally identical.
In the face of Dionisio’s reafﬁrmation of Boyd (albeit in dictum), Ryan
might have been limited to production of personal tax records by analo-
gizing such records to corporate documents and invoking Hale’s necessity
rationale. Indeed, the Court’s decision in Couch v. United States,51 decided
the same year as Dionisio, suggested as much. Noting that federal law
requires disclosure of much of the information in tax records, the Court
in Couch stated that in a “situation where obligations of disclosure exist

and under a system largely dependent upon honest self-reporting even
to survive . . . [a person] cannot reasonably claim, either for Fourth or
Fifth Amendment purposes, an expectation of protected privacy or conﬁ-
dentiality.”52 Perhaps this reasoning could have differentiated government
attempts to obtain tax records from its efforts to obtain other types of pri-
vate ﬁnancial records, as well as medical, educational, and similar personal
information held in record form.
But that is not the route the Court chose to take. Rather, in Fisher v.
United States,53 decided in 1976, it discarded all the language, from Boyd
through Dionisio, regarding the distinction between personal and business
papers. Like Ryan, Fisher involved a tax summons for personal records,
but, unlike Ryan, Fisher directly repudiated the Fifth Amendment Boyd
claim in a way that appeared to apply to all documents, not just tax records.
More speciﬁcally, Fisher suggested that subpoenas virtually never impli-
cate the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition of compelled self-incrimination,
either because they do not compel information or because, if they do, the
information they compel is not self-incriminating. First, the Court noted,
a subpoena does not force the creation of the sought-after documents,
and thus the disclosure of document content demanded by a subpoena
does not implicate the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition of compelled self-
incrimination.54 Second, Fisher held that while a subpoena does compel the
production of documents, that act does not provide the government with
any useful incriminating information, at least when the act of production
is not an important element of the prosecution’s proof or the government
can prove the source in some other way (which is often the case).55
The most important aspect of Fisher is that it shifted Fifth Amendment
analysis from the zone-of-privacy paradigm to a focus on coercion. As the
Court said, “We cannot cut the Fifth Amendment completely loose from
the moorings of its language, and make it serve as a general protector
of privacy, a word not mentioned in its text.”56 Because the content of
nonbusiness documents is no more compelled than the content of business
documents, Fisher appeared to repudiate the impersonal-corporate versus
personal-individual distinction that earlier cases had emphasized. Indeed,
eight years after Fisher, Justice O’Connor felt conﬁdent enough about
this point to assert that “the Fifth Amendment provides absolutely no
protection for the contents of private papers of any kind.”57
That is not the end of the story, however. Subsequent cases indicate
that the act of producing papers may be more likely to reveal incriminat-
ing information than Fisher suggested. For instance, in Braswell v. United

States,58 decided twelve years after Fisher, the Court held that while the
custodian of records generally may not resist a subpoena on the grounds
that production might incriminate him personally, he should be able to
prevent the government from mentioning that he was the custodian. The
Court also stated that the custodian might even be able to avoid handing
over the records in the ﬁrst place if he could show, for instance, “that he is
the sole employee and ofﬁcer of the corporation [and] that the jury would
[thereby] conclude that he produced the records.”59 And, in United States
v. Hubbell,60 decided in 2000, the Court held that where the location and
identity of the documents demanded by a subpoena are not known by the
government beforehand, then compelling their production from the target
of the investigation may implicate the Fifth Amendment. In that situation,
the respondent is forced to take “the mental and physical steps necessary
to provide the prosecutor with an accurate inventory of the many sources
of potentially incriminating evidence sought by the subpoena.”61
Perhaps Hubbell moves Fifth Amendment analysis partially back
toward Boyd. Some commentators have gone so far as to say that Hubbell
requires probable cause in order to obtain a valid subpoena for documents
sought from the target.62 That is probably an exaggeration of that decision’s
impact, especially where only a few documents are sought and the target
need not guess what the government is after.63 But even if Hubbell does
reintegrate the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, it does not affect the lion’s
share of subpoenas that seek personal papers, because most of these are
directed at third parties, not at those who are the subject of the records.
Third-Party Subpoenas
While early twentieth-century cases adhered to the idea that the Fifth
Amendment prohibited access to personal papers held by the target, they
just as clearly stated that the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit com-
pelling third parties to produce documents that are later used against
the target. A 1913 decision by the Supreme Court put the matter quite
pithily: “A party is privileged from producing evidence but not from its
production.”64 The exception to this rule, recognized at least as far back
as the eighteenth century,65 was that records given to an attorney were
protected to the same extent as they would be if retained by their owner.
Fisher continued to recognize this exception as a means of honoring the
attorney-client privilege.66 But once Fisher reduced the scope of the Fifth
Amendment privilege for targets, the extent to which attorneys could rely

on the Fifth Amendment to resist a subpoena aimed at client records was
correspondingly limited.
That treatment of the Fifth Amendment left the Fourth Amendment
as the only feasible protector of personal records held by third parties.67
Although Hale had made clear that the Fourth Amendment places few
restrictions even on document subpoenas directed at the target of an in-
vestigation, in 1967 the Supreme Court decided Katz. As already noted in
several places in this book, Katz appeared to liberalize Fourth Amendment
doctrine by rejecting a property-based, formalistic reading of the Fourth
Amendment and establishing that its guarantees were meant to protect
expectations of privacy that “society is prepared to recognize as ‘reason-
able.’ ” Given the private information potentially obtained via a subpoena,
Katz opened up the possibility that the Court might require probable cause
for a subpoena for personal information sought from third parties, or at
least impose on third-party subpoenas restrictions roughly equivalent to
that imposed on ﬁrst-party subpoenas by the act-of-production doctrine.
But within ten years of the Katz decision the Court had squelched any
movement toward converting third-party subpoenas into warrants. The
ﬁrst intimation of its unwillingness to apply Katz to subpoenas came in
Couch, which involved seizure of records from the petitioner’s tax accoun-
tant. There the Court asserted that “there can be little expectation of pri-
vacy where records are handed to an accountant, knowing that mandatory
disclosure of much of the information therein is required in an income tax
return.”68 At least that language left open a ruling that records not subject
to mandatory disclosure would be afforded more Fourth Amendment pro-
tection. However, in United States v. Miller,69 handed down the same day
as Fisher, the Court appeared to eliminate even that possibility. In Miller,
the Court decided that the Fourth Amendment imposes no restrictions on
any type of third-party subpoena, other than those that protect the third
party.
The defendant in Miller argued that a subpoena duces tecum that re-
quired his bank to produce various records describing his ﬁnancial dealings
violated his Fourth Amendment rights. But the Court concluded, in effect,
that Miller did not have standing to make this argument. Referring to War-
ren Court cases involving defendants who made incriminating disclosures
to undercover agents,70 the Court noted that it had “held repeatedly that
the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information re-
vealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities.”

risk the acquaintance will be or turn into an informant, a bank depositor
“takes the risk, in revealing his affairs to another, that the information will
be conveyed by that person to the government.”71 The Court concluded,
therefore, that Miller possessed no cognizable expectation of privacy in
the ﬁnancial information kept by his bank.
Miller left no doubt that the Court would reject a narrow interpretation
of Couch. The records at issue in Miller were not subject to mandatory dis-
closure under the tax laws. Further, they described all of Miller’s ﬁnancial
activities with the bank and included three monthly statements.72 Yet these
differences with Couch did not give the Court pause, as indicated by its
declaration that the Fourth Amendment does not protect information in
third-party records “even if the information is revealed on the assumption
that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the conﬁdence placed
in the third party will not be betrayed.”73 This language and the result in
Miller would also seem to undercut any distinction based on the precise
nature of the ﬁnancial information in question.74
In any event, the Supreme Court has applied Miller’s rationale to phone
company records (in Smith v. Maryland)75 and loan applications (in United
States v. Payner),76 and lower courts have used it to uphold subpoenas for
personal records from medical institutions,77 auditors and accountants,78
trustees in bankruptcy,79 and government institutions.80 Miller also has
been the basis for cases upholding federal statutes that permit government
access to the records of ISPs and to stored e-mail.81 Except in cases where
a third party objects on overbreadth grounds, the Fourth Amendment as
construed in Miller appears to offer no protection for personal records
held by third parties, regardless of how much information in those records
is provided by the subject of the records or the contractual arrangements
between the parties.
This position has assumed ever greater signiﬁcance as innovations in
computerization have made personal information both more likely to be
communicated to third-party recordholders and more accessible. When
Hale was decided, government recordkeeping was minimal and business
recordkeeping was sparse.82 Even in 1976, when Miller was handed down,
the Information Age had not begun in earnest.83 Today, as already noted,
government agencies keep detailed databases on many aspects of our lives,
banks and credit card companies maintain voluminous statements on our
ﬁnancial purchases, phone and Internet companies record our communica-
tions, hospitals develop computerized descriptions of our health problems,
and digital records exist about our video rentals, library borrowing, and

travel destinations. To obtain access to all this information, Miller requires,
at most, a showing of relevance.
Summary: From Complete to Virtually Nonexistent Protection
At the end of the nineteenth century, Boyd afﬁrmed the common law ban
on government efforts to obtain incriminating papers from their owners.
Although that ban was soon lifted for business papers, only in the last quar-
ter of the twentieth century did the Court relax constitutional strictures
on subpoenas for self-incriminating personal papers. In contrast, consti-
tutional restrictions on subpoenas for papers in the possession of third
parties have always been lax. In the latter setting the historical change has
not been in the law but in the extent to which personal information is now
housed with third parties.
The result of these developments is that, as a constitutional matter,
the minimal relevance standard once used primarily in connection with
business subpoenas now authorizes access to vast amounts of personal
information, to wit, any personal information that is in record form, with
the possible exception of information found in records possessed by the
target that the government is not sure exist. On the surface, at least, that
regime seems to conﬂict with the Fourth Amendment’s injunction that
searches and seizures of papers, as well as of houses, persons, and effects, be
declared unreasonable unless authorized by a warrant based on probable
cause. To determine whether the current system is justiﬁable, a closer look
at its rationales is necessary.
II. Rationales for Deregulating Subpoenas
The case law recited above relies, directly or indirectly, on a number of
justiﬁcations for continuing to leave subpoenas largely unregulated. The
discussion below separates these justiﬁcations into six rationales. The ﬁrst
four can be characterized as arguments that subpoenas do not involve a
search for Fourth Amendment purposes because they do not infringe on
reasonable expectations of privacy, while the last two focus on the strength
of the government’s interest in keeping subpoenas unregulated. The ﬁrst
and last rationales apply to all subpoenas, whereas the rest focus on third-
party subpoenas. The conclusion I reach is that a few of these rationales do
support relaxed strictures on subpoenas where business and other entity

crime is concerned, but that none justify permitting government to obtain
personal records merely on a showing of relevance.
Subpoenas Are Not Intrusive
In his concurring opinion in Hale, Justice Joseph McKenna took the ma-
jority to task for even suggesting that the Fourth Amendment applied to
subpoenas. In contrast to the traditional search, he argued, the subpoena
does not involve “trespass or force” and “cannot be ﬁnally enforced ex-
cept after challenge.”84 Forty years later, in Oklahoma Press, a majority of
the Court echoed these sentiments, stating that subpoenas do not trigger
“actual searches” because they do not require a physical intrusion; rather,
they are, at most, “constructive” searches carried out by the target himself
or herself.85 Thus, several Supreme Court justices have suggested that doc-
ument subpoenas are not Fourth Amendment searches for the following
reasons: (1) they rely on the recordholder, not the government, to produce
the documents; (2) the target can challenge them before surrendering any
items; and (3) they do not involve physical trespass or intrusion.
If the scope of the Fourth Amendment is to be determined with refer-
ence to reasonable expectations of privacy, all three of these rationales for
the minimal restrictions on subpoenas are specious. The fact that it is the
target (or a third party) rather than the police who locates the documents
obviously does not change the nature of the revelations they contain, which
can include information about medical treatment, ﬁnances, education, the
identity of one’s communicants, and even the contents of one’s communi-
cations. The target’s ability to challenge a subpoena, while it may inhibit
some ﬁshing expeditions, at most will only delay government access to
the records, unless something beyond the current relevance standard is
applicable; recall also that for many types of third-party subpoenas the
target has no right of challenge. And if the notion that searches occur only
when the government engages in physical invasion of private space were
correct, then communications surveillance and physical surveillance of the
home would not be a search, since neither usually requires a trespass or
use of force. Yet, as noted in earlier chapters, the Supreme Court has ﬁrmly
declared that both of the latter government actions are governed by the
Fourth Amendment and require warrants based on probable cause.
While the technological surveillance example demonstrates why phys-
ical intrusiveness should not be dispositive on the search issue, it does
not necessarily dictate that all document subpoenas be based on probable

cause. First, not all records are easily categorized as sufﬁciently private to
warrant the degree of constitutional protection provided to communica-
tions and activities that take place inside the home. In particular, business
records—the type of records involved in all the Supreme Court’s early
subpoena cases—might be considered much less personal than individ-
ual medical, ﬁnancial, and e-mail records; as the history described above
makes clear, the Court has routinely recognized as much in a number
of cases.
Second, even when the records sought are personal in nature, the rules
governing surveillance in cases like Berger and Kyllo do not appear to
apply when the records are held by third parties, because generally only
those subjected to surveillance may challenge it.86 This limitation derives
from well-established doctrine that the Fourth Amendment’s protections
can be asserted only by those whose own private enclave is infringed by
the government’s action. That doctrine is, of course, the putative basis of
the Court’s opinion in United States v. Miller.
Third-Party Subpoenas Do Not Infringe on the Target’s Privacy
Miller held that we cannot challenge government access to our personal
information when it is possessed by a third-party recordholder because
we have surrendered it “voluntarily” and thus “assume the risk” that the
third party will provide it to the government. But Miller’s version of Fourth
Amendment standing is easily challenged. There are two signiﬁcant prob-
lems with the Court’s reasoning in that case.
The ﬁrst problem, as many have pointed out,87 is that the Court simply
deﬁes reality when it says that one voluntarily surrenders information to
doctors, banks, schools, and phone and Internet providers. It is impossible
to get treatment, engage in ﬁnancial transactions, obtain an education,
or communicate with others without providing personal information to
the relevant facilitating entities or allowing those entities to collect it. To
choose to forgo these activities would mean an isolated, unproductive,
and possibly much foreshortened existence. The undercover agent cases,
on which Miller relied, involve an entirely different dynamic, where re-
fusing to interact with a particular individual is a realistic option. Miller
transforms all recordkeeping institutions into undercover agents, which all
but hermits are powerless to avoid.
Even if the choice to reveal personal information to a third party or
to allow a third party to collect it could somehow be characterized as

voluntary, the Miller Court’s second key assertion—that one thereby as-
sumes the risk that the third party will convey it to the government—is
pure judicial ﬁat. As I noted in chapter 3, we assume only those risks
of unregulated government intrusion that the courts tell us we have to
assume. Perhaps more to the point, even though Miller has been the law
for more than three decades, most people probably would be surprised to
learn that banks hand over ﬁnancial information to the government virtu-
ally any time the government wants it. In the Slobogin and Schumacher
study described in chapter 2, “perusing bank records” was viewed as more
intrusive than “searching [a] footlocker in a car” and a number of other
government actions that require probable cause or reasonable suspicion, a
ﬁnding replicated in a new study reported in chapter 7.88 Also noteworthy
is the fact that a number of state courts have rejected, on state law grounds,
Miller’s precise holding regarding bank records,89 and many others have
declared that the decision does not apply to medical records.90
To say Miller is wrong is not to say that third-party subpoenas always
require probable cause, however. Again, certain types of records (for ex-
ample, some forms of public documents) may not be entitled to as much
protection as others (for example, those containing medical and ﬁnan-
cial information), distinctions that chapter 7 develops in more detail. The
important point for present purposes is that the government should not
have practically unrestricted access to records simply because they contain
information that has been surrendered to the recordholder.
Third-Party Records Belong to the Third Party
One also might try to justify Miller’s holding by focusing on the record-
holder’s, rather than the subject’s, interest in the information. After all, the
third party ostensibly “owns” the records, not only because it physically
possesses them but because it (usually) creates them. Arguably, this prop-
erty interest confers on the recordholder the right to assign the information
and eliminates the subject’s control over it.91 A variant of this argument
asserts that permitting the subject to limit the third party’s use of personal
data unduly restricts the third party’s interests in commercial freedom and
freedom of speech.92
This property rationale has both descriptive and normative ﬂaws. The
descriptive problem is that although the physical documents maintained
by third-party recordholders may be the third party’s property alone, their
content generally is not wholly within their control. Indeed, federal law

recognizes that individuals retain an interest even in information main-
tained in public records; under the Privacy Act we have a right to partic-
ipate in the use, review, and disposal of our ﬁles,93 and the Freedom of
Information Act circumscribes outsider access to a wide range of personal
information in government ﬁle cabinets and computers.94 Jerry Mashaw
has gone so far as to say that these two statutes “gave all citizens ‘property
rights’ in the information held by government bureaus.”95 If that is true
of public records, it should surely be the case with privately held records
such as those maintained by hospitals, banks, and schools, because their
contents are even more likely created under laws that give the subject
some degree of control over them.96
The normative ﬂaw in the property rationale is identical to the ﬂaw in
Miller. Third-party recordholders possess the personal information they
do because people must give it to them in order to function in society; in
property terms, the subjects are often involuntary or inadvertent bailors
of the information, and recordholders are their bailees. Recognition of
this point does not mean that the individual can prevent the third party
from using the information for the purpose for which it was obtained.
But it should mean that the third party does not have total discretion to
do whatever it wants with the information simply because it “owns” it, a
principle that a number of jurisdictions—domestic and foreign—explicitly
recognize.97 In other words, the subjects of records should have standing
to contest their disclosure to law enforcement unless the records were
constructed for that purpose.
But suppose the third party has a privacy policy that speciﬁcally notiﬁes
the subject that information surrendered to it may be transmitted to other
entities, including the government? Then hasn’t one contracted away any
property interest in the information? In theory, of course, a person should
be able to consent to disclosure of personal facts. But as Daniel Solove has
persuasively argued, contract- and market-based models do not work well
in this context.98 We rarely have any real “relationship” with the third-
party entities that acquire our information, possess virtually no bargain-
ing power over them, are often ignorant of or confused about the third
party’s privacy “offer,” and in any event frequently have no way to opt
out of or ﬁne-tune the “contract.” As Solove says, there is “a problem in
the nature of the market itself that prevents fair and voluntary informa-
tion transactions.”99 That, of course, is the same sort of reason Miller is
ﬂawed.

Subpoenas Duces Tecum = Subpoenas Ad Testiﬁcandum
The next rationale for minimally restricting governmental requisition of
records rests on an analogy to the law governing demands for testimony
from a third party. Many witnesses subject to subpoena are not the targets
of the investigation and thus will not be able to (or want to) assert the
Fifth Amendment. Because the government can compel these third-party
witnesses to reveal information about a person without demonstrating any
suspicion regarding that person, this argument posits, it should be able to
obtain records from a third party under the same circumstances.100
Looked at more closely, however, this analogy between subpoenas ad
testiﬁcandum and subpoenas duces tecum does not work. Neither of the
two reasons a witness should be able to testify over a target’s objection
applies to a third-party recordholder. The ﬁrst reason, having to do with
the witness’s prerogatives, is discussed here. The second, which has to do
with the government’s interest in hearing the witness, is discussed in the
next section.
It may seem incontestable that, outside of those situations where the
attorney-client, spousal, or other privileges apply, no person should be
able to prevent another from providing information to the government.
But explicating why that is the case for the typical third-party witness
makes clear why third-party institutions should be treated differently. As
Mary Coombs has argued, people in possession of information about oth-
ers, even information that is “private” and obtained through an intimate
relationship, have “an autonomy-based right to choose to cooperate with
the authorities.”101 According to Coombs, “To deny even the possibility
of such a decision [to cooperate] is to turn a freely chosen relationship
into a status, denying one person’s full personhood to protect another’s
interests.”102 In other words, the autonomy interest of a putative witness
trumps the privacy interest of a putative target when a witness decides to
reveal information about the target. Thus, the target should not be able to
control the witness’s testimony.
But that analysis makes sense only when the third party is a person.
Most records are held by institutions, not people. And as Hale suggested
a century ago when it denied corporations the privilege against self-
incrimination,103 institutions do not have autonomy interests. A bank,
hospital, or ISP is not denied its “personhood” when its ability to turn
information over to the government is restricted. Accordingly, the analogy
between third-party witnesses and third-party recordholders fails. Targets

should be able to expect that information will remain with the institution
unless the government demonstrates a substantial need for it.
This view of the Fourth Amendment’s intersection with third-party au-
tonomy interests helps to explain why the undercover agent cases do not
support Miller’s reasoning. Many commentators have argued that both
sets of decisions are wrong—that we should be able to expect that the
government will not turn either our social or our business relationships
into investigative tools without some justiﬁcation.104 But even if, relying
on Coombs’s analysis, one accepts the “social undercover agent” cases
as valid law, they are distinguishable from the “institutional undercover
agent” cases like Miller because social agents have an autonomy interest
that institutional agents lack. In cases involving the latter scenario, there
is no third-party interest to trump the target’s interest in privacy, which
should therefore be accorded greater respect than it is under current sub-
poena jurisprudence.
Third Parties Are Obligated to Provide the Government with
Investigative Leads
The second reason that might be given for allowing a witness to testify
over a target’s objection focuses on government rather than witness inter-
ests. The Supreme Court frequently has spoken of the obligation to give
testimony to grand juries.105 Certainly citizens should feel they have a duty
to help government apprehend law violators. Thus, the argument here is
that third-party recordholders have a duty to hand over documents that
might tend to incriminate others, even over strenuous objections by those
incriminated.
Again, there are descriptive and normative problems with this argu-
ment. Although the Court talks about an obligation to provide evidence
against others, in fact most jurisdictions no longer criminalize misprision,
and, at least when their interlocutor is a police ofﬁcer, individuals are not
legally required to respond to inquiries even when the potential for self-
incrimination is nonexistent.106 What the Court probably intends to say
when it speaks of evidentiary duties is that the individual has an obligation,
enforced by the contempt power, to respond to a valid subpoena.
Sotherealissueis,whenisasubpoenavalid?Myanswertothatquestion
should be apparent by now. While a relevance showing may be sufﬁcient
to support a subpoena for business documents or testimony from a third-
party witness, that low standard ought to be presumptively inadequate
when personal information is sought from the subject (in which case a

warrant should be required or immunity granted) or from a third-party
recordholder such as a bank, hospital, or ISP. In the latter situation, one can
counterpose against the recordholder’s “duty to give evidence” a ﬁduciary
“duty of allegiance,” which obligates the recordholder to use information
for the purpose for which it is acquired.107 As discussed above, empirical
evidence suggests that this ﬁduciary duty is consistent with current societal
understandings.
Although the few courts that have addressed the issue have been re-
luctant to endorse a duty of allegiance, their hesitation has come in cases
where the “personal” information disclosed by the third party was not
particularly private.108 Whatever the appropriate result is in such cases,
the duty should be much stronger where its breach involves an individ-
ual’s medical, ﬁnancial, and similar personal information. Recognition of
such a duty may also beneﬁt the third party, which otherwise risks the
enmity of many of its customers, as evidenced by recent criticism of the
telecom companies that purportedly handed over phone record data to the
government.109 This duty would not, of course, prohibit the government
from obtaining personal information from third parties. But it would re-
quire that the government demonstrate a need for the information beyond
mere relevance. Absent such a showing, the obligations of the third party
should run to the subject of the records, not the state.
Regulating Subpoenas Would Destroy Investigative Effectiveness
The most common objection to the position just described is the one
advanced originally in Hale: a higher standard would make government
regulation impossible. This rationale frequently appears in cases justify-
ing administrative subpoenas issued by government agencies. In the mid-
twentieth-century case of United States v. White, for instance, the Supreme
Court stated, “The scope and nature of the economic activities of incorpo-
rated and unincorporated organizations and their representatives demand
that the constitutional power of the federal and state governments to regu-
late those activities be correspondingly effective,” and went on to uphold a
subpoena against a labor union.110 A modern pronouncement of this claim
can be found in Judge Bruce M. Selya’s dissent in Parks v. FDIC,111 a First
Circuit case that brieﬂy recognized enhanced protection for private papers
before being withdrawn:
Administrative investigations differ signiﬁcantly from criminal investigations:
government agencies typically investigate in order to enforce compliance with

complicatedstructuresofeconomicregulation.Theabilitytoobtaininformation
from regulated parties and those persons in privity with them typically is vital
to the success of the regulatory scheme [citing Morton Salt Co. and Oklahoma
Press] . . . . And it is a fact of life that agencies charged with regulating economic
activity often cannot articulate probable cause or even reasonable suspicion that
a violation has transpired without ﬁrst examining documents reﬂecting a party’s
economic activity. . . . This incipient problem—the need to hitch the horse in
front of the cart—is frequently exacerbated because the subpoena power has
great signiﬁcance for most administrative agencies in the conduct of important
public business.112
These sentiments about the need to ease restrictions on agency inves-
tigations are oft-repeated. But note that both statements refer to cases
involving organizational targets. White’s call for “effective” regulation is
based on a perceived need to probe the “economic activities of incorpo-
rated and unincorporated organizations,” and Judge Selya speciﬁcally dis-
tinguishes “administrative investigations” from “criminal investigations.”
In short, these decisions use the impossibility rationale only in the same
subset of cases that previous discussion associated with diminished privacy
concerns.
The same sort of distinction can be seen in grand jury cases, although
it is less conspicuous. A constant refrain in decisions about grand jury
subpoenas since at least 1919 is the notion that “the public has a right
to every man’s evidence”—the ﬂip side of the idea that citizens have a
duty to help the government.113 That language suggests that the Court
believes there is a strong government need for the information that such
subpoenas provide. Yet, consistent with the grand jury’s historical focus
on organizational and, in particular, governmental corruption rather than
individual crimes,114 these cases also routinely note that the grand jury
inquiry is limited by the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition on compelling a
person to incriminate himself or herself.115 A relatively recent case illus-
trating this impersonal-personal dichotomy is Dionisio. There, in line with
previous case law, the Supreme Court baldly stated that the grand jury’s
right to evidence from every citizen is “necessary to the administration of
justice.”116 But recall that Dionisio also carefully exempted “private books
and records” from its purview.
Of course, once Fisher limited the reach of the Fifth Amendment, this
exemption was vulnerable. As a result, the impossibility rationale has
found its way outside the corrupt-entity investigation context. For instance,

one lower court relied on the rationale in permitting a blood test on rele-
vance grounds. Given that grand jurors must have probable cause to indict,
the court stated, “it would be peculiar to require them to demonstrate the
same degree of probable cause to believe that a target of their investigation
committed a crime before the grand jury could properly obtain evidence in
aid of their investigation.”117 If applied to document subpoenas, this type of
reasoning would make no distinction between organizational documents
and personal ones.
That would be a mistake. First, of course, the impossibility rationale is
a dangerous one regardless of the context, for the government can always
make pleas that the Fourth Amendment and other constitutional rights
make its law enforcement job difﬁcult. Even accepting the impossibility
rationale on its face, however, it at most justiﬁes minimal restrictions on
subpoenas for business records and—at a stretch—for private ﬁnancial
records of individuals that must be maintained for tax purposes (assuming
Couch is right that otherwise the tax system would not survive).118 It does
not explain why subpoenas as currently conceptualized should authorize
compulsory production of personal records in connection with ordinary
“criminal investigations,” to use Judge Selya’s language.
Perhaps judges are not attuned to this problem because they believe
that subpoenas are seldom used for such purposes. That assumption, while
probably true during much of the twentieth century, is no longer accurate.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, government subpoenas directed
at personal records held by ISPs, banks, and other institutions have been
particularly proliﬁc.119 Even outside the national security context, personal
record subpoenas are common. For instance, the Department of Justice
uses subpoenas not only to investigate antitrust violations, government
fraud, and other organizational crimes but also to obtain records in con-
nection with sexual exploitation and abuse of children, false claims and
bribery, racketeering, and possession or sale of controlled substances.120
And the Justice Department is not shy about taking advantage of its sub-
poena authority. In 2001, for instance, it issued almost 1,900 subpoenas
seeking Internet records concerning child exploitation and abuse.121
Whatever might be the case with respect to complex economic wrong-
doing, there is no truth to the claim that street crimes are impossible to
investigate without the power to subpoena all types of personal records. In
most such cases, the content of documents is secondary to other evidence
obtained through interviews and interrogations, physical observation, tra-
ditional searches, and other nondocumentary investigative techniques.122

Even with respect to individual crimes that depend on transactional proof,
such as fraud, tax evasion, and computer hacking, development of indi-
vidualized suspicion is generally easier than in regulatory cases, where the
chain of command hides responsibility, proof can involve technical and
very complex evidence, and nondocumentary evidence of crime may not
exist.123 The impossibility rationale, as applied to personal papers, is not
based on reason but on tradition, a tradition created in cases concerned
about the efﬁcacy of the administrative state rather than everyday law
enforcement.

between personal and impersonal records is a crucial one because it deﬁnes
the threshold at which the relevance standard should no longer apply. Thus
far not much has been said about the nature of that threshold. As it turns
out, Supreme Court case law is very helpful in deﬁning it. This assistance
comes not, as one might think, from the Court’s Fourth Amendment cases
but rather from its Fifth Amendment jurisprudence, which, in its early
incarnation, tried to delineate a zone of privacy.
Boyd, the Supreme Court’s initial foray into the constitutionality of sub-
poena law, held that even business papers fell within the privacy zone.124
But Hale soon created the distinction that permeates this chapter. As indi-
cated previously, Hale denied the Fifth Amendment right to corporations
on the ground that a corporation is “a creature of the state,” in contrast
to the individual citizen, who “owes no duty to the state . . . to divulge his
business.”125 Hale was the ﬁrst in a series of cases that laid out the so-called
collective entity exception to the scope of the Fifth Amendment privi-
lege.126 In effect, the Court used this exception to delineate the difference
between personal and impersonal papers.
By the time of Fisher, which changed the focus of the Fifth Amendment
from privacy to coercion and thus marginalized the exception, the Court
had expanded the collective entity doctrine to encompass far more than
corporations (the entity prosecuted in Hale). For instance, ﬁve years after
Hale, in Wilson v. United States, the Court found that a corporate ofﬁcer’s
refusal to produce subpoenaed corporate records was not protected by the
privilege even when their production might also incriminate him person-
ally, because the records were not “personal”; rather they were “subject

to examination by the demanding authority” and their custodian thereby
had “accepted the incident obligation to permit inspection.”127 Some three
decades after Wilson, the Court held in White that labor unions were also
“collective entities,” because a union has “a character so impersonal in the
scope of its membership and activities that it cannot be said to embody or
represent the purely private or personal interests of its constituents, but
rather to embody their common or group interests only.”128
Thirty years later, and two years before Fisher, the Court narrowed the
zone of privacy even further by refusing, in Bellis v. United States,129 to
permit a small law ﬁrm to assert the privilege. Although the ﬁrm was a
partnership that “embodied little more than the personal legal practice
of the individual partners,” it was a “formal institutional arrangement or-
ganized for the continuing conduct of the ﬁrm’s legal practice” and thus
was “an independent entity apart from its individual members.”130 United
States v. Doe,131 decided after Fisher, continued in the spirit of Bellis by
holding that even a sole proprietor’s records are not protected by the Fifth
Amendment (unless, per Fisher, the act of production provides the gov-
ernment with proof of its case), thus dealing the ﬁnal blow to the Boyd
doctrine as applied to businesses.132 Lower courts have also recognized an
analogous “government records exception” that governs subpoenas for
records describing the operations of a government agency.133
During the same period it was developing the collective entity doctrine,
the Court was sketching out the contours of a “required records” exception
to the Fifth Amendment, in connection with subpoenas for records of
individuals. In Shapiro v. United States, decided in 1948, the Court held
that the Fifth Amendment did not bar a subpoena directing an individual
to produce commodity sales records that the Emergency Price Control
Act required him to maintain.134 Although the Court recognized that the
government should not be able to vitiate the privilege simply by requiring
that an individual keep and surrender written records, it concluded that in
this case there was “a sufﬁcient relation between the activity sought to be
regulated and the public concern.”135
More persuasively, in the later case of Grosso v. United States, the
Court stated that the required records exception applied when the govern-
ment’s purpose was “essentially regulatory,” the information sought was
of the type “customarily kept” by the individual, and the records “have
assumed ‘public aspects’ which render them at least analogous to pub-
lic documents.”136 These criteria, it has been said, validate any subpoena
for “essentially public documents such as routine income tax forms” and

for documents held by “persons engaged in highly regulated industries
[that] are required to be maintained as a part of a regulatory scheme.”137
In other words, documents of individuals are subject to subpoena under
the required records doctrine when, as in the collective entity cases, their
attributes of privacy are minimal.
The collective entity and required records exceptions come from cases
construing the Fifth Amendment. But they resonate with Fourth Amend-
ment concerns. Indeed, the required records exception’s emphasis on per-
vasive regulation parallels the Supreme Court’s administrative search ju-
risprudence, which allows searches of pervasively regulated businesses on
less than probable cause.138 Thus, to the extent they adhere to the param-
eters described above, the collective entity and required records doctrines
may provide a satisfactory benchmark for determining when subpoenas
may be based solely on relevance and when they should be based on some-
thing more.
One might also try to construct the type of distinction described here
by relying on the First Amendment’s differentiation between political
and commercial speech.139 Traditionally, commercial speech has been en-
titled to much less protection from government regulation than political
speech,140 and organizational records might similarly be accorded less pro-
tectionthanindividualrecords.Butambiguitiesinthepolitical-commercial
distinction,141 as well as the fact that business records can contain political
information and individual records often contain nothing remotely polit-
ical,142 make the First Amendment paradigm far less certain and much
harder to administer than the rejuvenated Fourth/Fifth Amendment ap-
proach to determining the extent to which government ought to have ac-
cess to records. At most, the First Amendment supplements the Fourth
Amendment’s privacy protection in a narrow subset of cases.143
Conclusion
Document subpoenas are a standard criminal investigative tool today.
But until relatively recently these subpoenas could not be used to ob-
tain records from a person who could show that they would incriminate
him or her personally, unless the government could show they were en-
tity documents or “essentially” public documents required to be kept for
regulatory purposes. Although said to be mandated by the Fifth Amend-
ment’s prohibition of compelled testimony, the latter showings depended

on the extent to which the records were personal and private. At the same
time, the Fourth Amendment, ostensibly the linchpin of constitutional
privacy protection, was pushed into the background and thus provided
minimal protection against document subpoenas, whether addressed to
third parties or to the target of an investigation, and whether aimed at
organizational or personal records. It is entirely possible that the early
twentieth-century Court allowed Fourth Amendment limitations on sub-
poenas to wither because it assumed that personal records would always
be well protected by the Fifth Amendment.
Today, however, the Fifth Amendment’s restrictions on document sub-
poenas are substantially reduced, while Fourth Amendment restrictions
remain trivial. I have argued that this minimalist regulatory regime is un-
justiﬁable from a privacy perspective. At least where personal (as opposed
to organizational) documents are involved, the privacy concerns evinced in
earlier Fifth Amendment jurisprudence should be rejuvenated under the
aegis of the Fourth Amendment, not—as was initially true under the Fifth
Amendment—as an absolute bar to every document subpoena in criminal
cases, but rather as a protection against demands based merely on ofﬁcial
curiosity. Further, this stronger suspicion requirement for obtaining per-
sonal data should apply to third-party as well as ﬁrst-party subpoenas; the
privacy interest in personal information that increasingly must be trans-
ferredtothirdpartiesinordertofunctionintoday’sworldisnotdiminished
simply by the fact of transfer or by the government’s avowed need for the
information. In short, the Fourth Amendment should be interpreted to
demand that all “papers” within the zone of privacy—whether held by the
subject or by a third-party institution—be afforded protection similar to
that extended to the individual’s house, person, and effects.

chapter seven
Regulating Transaction Surveillance
by the Government
T
he previous chapter made the general case for enhanced regulation
of transaction surveillance. This chapter ﬂeshes out the argument.
Section 1 describes the current law regulating transaction surveillance. Not
only is this regulation minimal, it is confusing and contradictory; beyond
the traditional subpoena, challengeable by the target of the investigation,
current law recognizes a number of subpoena mutations that seem to have
little rhyme or reason. If it contributes nothing else, this chapter should at
least clarify the nature of today’s regulatory framework.
Section 2 criticizes this framework and outlines a more promising ap-
proach. The proposed reform recognizes, as does the current regime, that
different sorts of records merit different levels of protection. But in con-
trast to prevailing law, the proposal would signiﬁcantly increase the degree
of protection in several situations: probable cause would be required for
private records obtained through target-driven surveillance, and reason-
able suspicion would be required for private records obtained through
event-driven surveillance and for quasi-private records obtained through
target-driven surveillance. The relevance standard that is currently so
popular would be reserved primarily for efforts to obtain organizational
records and records of public activities.
Section 3 concludes the chapter by examining two alternatives to the
proposal (and to the current regime) that sit at opposite ends of the regu-
latory spectrum: a requirement of probable cause for all records searches
and a regime permitting random records searches on condition that any-
thing discovered be subject to strict limitations on disclosure. In section 3,
I suggest why both of these approaches are unsatisfactory. I also express

concerns about any regulatory scheme—whatever its precise content—
that relies on the legislature, rather than the courts and the Fourth Amend-
ment, to establish fundamental regulatory requirements.
The sum of these arguments is simply stated. Not all recorded informa-
tion warrants maximum protection from government intrusion. But much
of it deserves far better protection than it receives today.
I. Current Legal Regulation of Transaction Surveillance
Transaction surveillance has become a particularly powerful and increas-
ingly popular law-enforcement tool. Even if we focus solely on domestic
transaction surveillance—that is, surveillance aimed at American citizens,
not at foreigners—the proliferation of record-search programs is astound-
ing. In January 2007 alone, the following newspaper stories appeared:
.
The Washington Post described a Defense Department program, known as
TALON (for Threat and Local Observation Notice), that has collected infor-
mation on thousands of American citizens who protested the war in Iraq and
other government policies and then made the data accessible to 28 government
organizations and more than 3,500 government ofﬁcials.1
.
The New York Times reported that the Pentagon, in its search for spies, has
accumulated ﬁles on hundreds of Americans from their banks, credit card com-
panies, and other ﬁnancial institutions, all of which it plans to keep indeﬁnitely,
even though apparently no arrests have resulted.2
.
The Los Angeles Times disclosed that the Internal Revenue Service and the
Social Security Administration made more than 12,000 “emergency disclosures”
ofpersonaldatatofederalintelligenceandlawenforcementagenciesin2002and
thousands more such disclosures each year since then, often via a program called
REVEAL that combines 16 government databases with databases maintained
by commercial data brokers.3
.
Other news reports revealed that the Department of Homeland Security, al-
ready operating an Automated Targeting System designed to assess the secu-
rity risk of millions of American and foreigners traveling overseas based on
their travel histories,4 is now testing a second program, known as ADVISE (for
Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight and Semantic Enhancement),
designed “to troll a vast sea of information, including audio and visual, and
extract suspicious people, places and other elements based on their links and
behavioral patterns.”5

More revelations about transaction surveillance by the government
came in March 2007. First, it was reported that the Bush administration
attempted to persuade ISPs to keep records, for at least two years, of
everyone who uploads photographs or videos onto a Web site, to facil-
itate tracking down people once particular content is determined to be
illegal or suggestive of criminal activity.6 A week later, the Justice Depart-
ment’s inspector general revealed that the FBI had obtained telephone
logs, banking records, and other personal information regarding thousands
of Americans not only in connection with counterterrorism efforts but also
in furtherance of ordinary law enforcement.7
As detailed later in this chapter, these programs are just the tip of the
iceberg. The government obviously believes that transaction surveillance is
a useful law enforcement tool. Given its potential for creating personality
mosaics and linking people to crime, this type of surveillance may now
be perceived as even more important than visual tracking of a person’s
activities and eavesdropping on or hacking into a person’s communica-
tions. But the real beauty of transaction surveillance for the government
is that, compared to physical surveillance of activities inside the home and
communications surveillance, it is so lightly regulated.
Transaction surveillance never requires probable cause or reasonable
suspicion,evenwhenitsprimarypurposeiscriminalinvestigation.Atmost,
government agents seeking transactional information need a subpoena,
whichisvalidsolongastheinformationitseeksis“relevant”toalegitimate
(statutorily authorized) investigation. Furthermore, as we shall see, the law
does not require even a traditional subpoena for most types of transaction
surveillance. Instead, the government, particularly Congress, has either
invented new forms of authorization that are even easier to obtain or
has simply permitted unfettered law enforcement access to transactional
information.
The following account of this weak regulatory regime starts with the
law governing real-time interception of so-called envelope information
connected with communications such as phone calls and e-mail messages.
Although technically this type of surveillance does not involve access-
ing extant records, neither does it involve interception of the content of
communications. Because of its hybrid nature and because the current
legal regime does not treat this type of surveillance in the same fashion as
communications surveillance, it is included here. The section goes on to
describe the law governing access to the content of public records and the
content of records held by private entities.

Real-Time Interception of Transaction Information
The government may intercept the content of communications (commonly
via wiretapping) only when authorized by a warrant based on probable
cause. But the government may intercept the identifying features of the
communication—the names of the communicators, their phone numbers or
e-mail addresses, and the addresses of Web sites visited—on a much lesser
showing. The Fourth Amendment does not apply at all to this type of trans-
action surveillance, and statutory law places virtually no restrictions on it.
The key Supreme Court case involving interception of envelope infor-
mation is Smith v. Maryland.8 There the Court held that any expectation of
privacy we may have in the phone numbers we dial is unreasonable because
we know or should know that phone companies keep a record of these
numbers and thus we assume the risk that the phone company will disclose
this information to the government.9 Because it is also generally known
that ISPs monitor, if only temporarily, our e-mails and Internet surﬁng,
the Court would probably also say that we assume the risk these providers
will become government informants. Although a uniform resource locator
(URL) can be more informative than a mere phone number, both because
it is an address and because it allows access to the Web site and thus permits
the government to ascertain what the user has viewed, the lower courts
applying Smith appear not to distinguish the two types of routing informa-
tion.10 Accordingly, the government can point to precedent establishing
that it may ignore the Fourth Amendment both when intercepting phone
numbers and when acquiring Internet addresses in real time.
Congress has imposed statutory restraints on this type of surveillance,
but nothing approaching the usual Fourth Amendment protections. The
relevant rules are found in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
of 1986 (ECPA), a statute that will ﬁgure prominently in much of the
following discussion on transaction surveillance law. With respect to the
real-time interception of envelope information in particular, ECPA creates
a highly streamlined authorization process, one that can be initiated by
either a federal government attorney or a state law enforcement ofﬁcer.
In order to use either a pen register (technology that intercepts outgoing
data) or a trap and trace device (technology that intercepts incoming data),
ECPA merely requires the government agent to certify to a court facts that
show the information sought is “relevant to an ongoing investigation” and
is “likely to be obtained by [the surveillance].”11 If that certiﬁcation is
made, the court must issue the order.12

The original version of ECPA dealt solely with phone numbers. The
USA Patriot Act of 2001 expanded the deﬁnition of pen registers and trap
and trace devices to include all mechanisms that obtain “dialing, routing,
addressing, or signaling information utilized in the processing and trans-
mitting of wire or electronic communications.”13 Thus, to use snoopware
or other means of ascertaining a person’s e-mail correspondents and fa-
vorite Web sites, the government need only certify the relevance of this
information to a current investigation. Again, if this certiﬁcation is made,
the court must issue an order.
Research has shown that magistrates sometimes rubber-stamp warrant
applications, and thus fail to remain “neutral and detached” as demanded
by the Fourth Amendment.14 But the Supreme Court has always assumed
that judicial independence is possible, and it has struck down several pro-
cedures that undermine that independence.15 Here, in contrast, Congress
has legislatively invented mandatory rubber-stamping. It is tempting to
call this type of authorization a “rubber-stamp order,” but I will instead
use the more measured term certiﬁcation order. Whatever one calls the
authorization process, it amounts to minimal limitation on interception of
transaction information.
Access to Publicly Held Records
Government efforts to access already-existing records—true transaction
surveillance—is best divided into attempts to obtain records from private
institutions and attempts to access public information, the latter of which
is covered here. Commercial data brokers such as ChoicePoint have made
records held by public entities much more accessible as a technological
matter.Norarethereanysigniﬁcantlegal obstaclestoobtainingthesetypes
of records. Under current law, law enforcement ofﬁcials do not need even
a certiﬁcation order to use ChoicePoint or similar computerized vehicles
for perusing public documents. In fact, law enforcement ofﬁcials need not
consult any other entity (certainly not a court, and not even a prosecutor)
before obtaining such information.
Again, the Fourth Amendment’s ban on unreasonable searches and
seizures might appear to apply here, because looking for and through
records is a search in the usual meaning of the word. But Smith and Miller
made clear that one cannot reasonably expect privacy in connection with
information voluntarily given to third parties. Remember the key declara-
tion in Miller: “[T]he Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining

of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Govern-
ment authorities, even if the information is revealed on the assumption that
it will be used only for a limited purpose and the conﬁdence placed in the
third party will not be betrayed” (emphasis added).
The Privacy Act of 1974 does bar or limit access to public records when
they are sought by private individuals, and even when most government
ofﬁcials want them.16 But when law enforcement ofﬁcials are after the
records, the Act requires merely a letter from the head of the agency
that is seeking the information, detailing the law enforcement reasons
a particular person’s information is needed.17 No court is involved, and
neither individualized suspicion nor even a relevance showing is required,
just the say-so of the law enforcement department. I will call this kind of
authorization an extrajudicial certiﬁcation.
Not even this level of authorization is necessary for government access
to most public records, however. The Privacy Act applies only to fed-
eral documents. Unless there is similar legislation at the state level, law
enforcement access to state public records is unrestricted.18 Furthermore,
the federal government takes the position that when it obtains information
from companies such as ChoicePoint, the Privacy Act does not apply at all,
because the Act’s extrajudicial certiﬁcation requirement is triggered only
by government efforts to get records from other government agencies and
from private companies that are administering a system of records for the
government, and neither description ﬁts commercial data brokers.19 Under
this interpretation, the only obstacle to complete government access to all
the data maintained by such companies is the price of the information.20
Access to Privately Held Records
Compared to the meager limitations on intercepting envelope information
and accessing public records, the restrictions on government access to the
contents of records held by nominally private entities, such as hospitals,
banks,phonecompanies,andISPs,havemoreteeth,buttheteethareblunt.
Again, the Fourth Amendment is pretty much irrelevant here. The notion
thatoneassumestheriskthatthirdpartieswillturngovernmentinformants
applies to private entities as well as public agencies. The Supreme Court
has speciﬁcally so held with respect to phone companies (in Smith) and
banks (in Miller). It has wavered in its willingness to declare private entities

constitutional limitations on law enforcement access.21 Although there are
also statutory constraints on government’s ability to access privately held
records, they are, for the most part, extremely weak.
Medical records receive the most protection under statutory law. Even
here, however, neither probable cause nor reasonable suspicion is re-
quired. Rather, pursuant to rules promulgated under the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the government can
obtain medical records from HMOs and hospitals with a subpoena. A
subpoena, it will be recalled, requires merely a ﬁnding that the informa-
tion sought is relevant to a law enforcement investigation, although the
target is entitled to notice and thus has the opportunity to challenge the
government’s action on relevance or privilege grounds.22 Given the limited
scope of the Privacy Act described above, even that obstacle is removed
if, as is true in some states with respect to certain types of medical data,
the information is maintained as a “public record” and the government
receives it through a commercial data broker.
Financial records receive similarly minimal protection. To get detailed
information from credit agencies, a regular subpoena is required under
the Fair Credit Reporting Act.23 However, analogous to the situation with
medical records, no law constrains government requests for such informa-
tion from database companies and other entities.24 As a result, government
routinely gets the ﬁnancial information it wants directly from a commercial
data broker, without bothering with a subpoena.25 Bank records are also
easily accessible. The Right to Financial Privacy Act generally requires
only a traditional subpoena to obtain ﬁnancial records from a bank. It also
recognizes a signiﬁcant variation to the traditional subpoena process: no-
tiﬁcation of the seizure may be delayed for up to 90 days if there is concern
that service of the subpoena will tip off a suspect, result in loss of evidence,
endanger witnesses, or in some other way compromise the government’s
investigation.26 In these circumstances, in contrast to the typical subpoena
process, the target of a ﬁnancial investigation will not ﬁnd out that the
government has the information until well after it is obtained. I call this
type of authorization a delayed-notice subpoena.
And this by no means exhausts the government’s innovations regarding
the subpoena power. Outside of situations covered by the Right to Finan-
cial Privacy Act and the Internal Revenue Code, a government agency
that is authorized to use administrative subpoenas to obtain ﬁnancial and
business information from third parties need not give any notice to the
customer whose records are sought.27 This practice recognizes still an-
other subpoena mutation, which I call an ex parte subpoena. This term

emphasizes that the customer is outside the process entirely, thus remov-
ing, in most cases, the only meaningful inhibition to a ﬁshing expedition
via subpoena.
Transaction surveillance of communications-related information is reg-
ulated in a similarly weak fashion. Under ECPA, real-time interception
of the content of phone and e-mail communications requires a warrant
based on probable cause.28 But if e-mail has sat on a server for longer than
180 days without being opened or the recipient of e-mail or voice mail
accesses it and stores it on an outside server for any length of time, then
a subpoena—delayed if necessary—is all that is needed to obtain the con-
tent of the communication.29 Apparently, the rationale behind permitting
easy access to unopened mail that is stored for 180 days is that it is, in
effect, abandoned.30 The rationale for requiring less than probable cause
for access to opened e-mail messages and other communications stored by
a third party is that they are akin to business records.31
ECPA also gives the government virtually unlimited access to business
records held by phone companies and ISPs. Under Title II of ECPA, as
amended by the Patriot Act of 2001, basic subscriber information—name,
address, session times and durations, length and type of service, means
and source of payment (including credit card numbers), and the identity
of Internet users who use a pseudonym—can be obtained pursuant to an
ex parte subpoena, the type of authorization that requires no customer
notice.32 If the government seeks additional transactional information—
such as account logs and e-mail addresses of other individuals with whom
the accountholder has corresponded—it still need not alert the subscriber,
but it must allege “speciﬁc and articulable facts showing that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that . . . the records or other information
sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.”33
Apparently, this latter standard, found in Section 2703(d) of ECPA,
is meant to be more demanding than the relevance standard normally re-
quired for a subpoena. Yet it is not clear that the standard is much different.
Although the “speciﬁc and articulable” language sounds like it requires
reasonable suspicion, note that the speciﬁc and articulable facts need only
support a ﬁnding that the information is “relevant and material” to an
ongoing investigation. Even if material is meant to augment relevant, it
does not add much; materiality, in evidence law, means merely that the
evidence be logically related to a proposition in the case.34 Furthermore,
whereas Terry contemplated that reasonable suspicion exist with respect
to the targeted individual, a Section 2703(d) order, like a subpoena, allows
access to any records that might be relevant to an investigation, not just the

target’s. Finally, it is not clear that the “relevant and material” language can
be meaningfully enforced. The statute seems to say that the only ground
on which an order issued pursuant to Section 2703(d) may be challenged
is burdensomeness, which eliminates a challenge on relevance grounds.35
Post-9/11, government access to some sorts of privately held records
is even easier when a signiﬁcant purpose of the investigation is to nab
terrorists or spies. Two separate subpoena-like mechanisms are important
here. The ﬁrst is an order under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. As origi-
nally enacted, that provision authorized the FBI to demand the production
of “any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents and
other items)” if it followed a two-step process.36 First, the director or his
or her designee had to certify to a court that the items sought were “for
an investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine
intelligence activities,” and that the investigation did not focus “solely” on
activities protected by the First Amendment. Second, the court had to ﬁnd
that the investigation met these conditions; if so, it was required to issue
a Section 215 order authorizing the seizure. In other words, a variant of
the certiﬁcation order discussed in connection with the use of pen registers
and trap and trace devices sufﬁced in this situation.
In March 2006, as part of the USA Patriot Improvement and Reau-
thorization Act, Congress placed a few more restrictions on this process.
First, only high-ranking ofﬁcials can request a Section 215 order that seeks
records regarding library transactions, book sales, and educational and
medical matters.37 Second, a mere certiﬁcation that the items relate to a
national security investigation is no longer sufﬁcient. Rather, the applica-
tion must include “a statement of facts showing that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that the tangible things sought are relevant to an autho-
rized investigation.”38 Third, procedures must be in place to “minimize”
dissemination of any information acquired.39 Fourth, a Section 215 order
is subject to judicial review upon request by the recordholder and allows
the judge to set aside or modify the order.40
Although in theory the amendments have made a Section 215 order
more difﬁcult to obtain, the applicable standard is still relevance, and the
issuing and reviewing judges apparently are still expected to refrain from
inquiring into the basis of the certiﬁcation and to limit themselves to mak-
ing sure the relevant statements of fact are provided.41 Note further that
the records that may be obtained in this way are not just those of sus-
pected terrorists but of anyone whose information might “protect against
international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.”42 Finally, the
Section 215 process is ex parte, with a twist: A third party served with a

Section 215 order is prohibited from telling the target (or, for that matter,
anyone other than a lawyer) about the order.43 Unlike the delayed-notice
subpoena, this gag order operates automatically; no ﬁnding that notice
might compromise the investigation is required. The 2006 amendments do
permit a challenge of this nondisclosure requirement, but only after one
year has passed since issuance of the order.44
Paul Rosenzweig has argued that the provision for judicial modiﬁcation,
together with the requirements that the government “swear” the certiﬁ-
cation is correct and that the attorney general report to Congress on the
use of Section 215,45 provides more safeguards than those associated with a
subpoena reviewable only after challenge.46 But if the judge is permitted to
modify an order only to accommodate First Amendment concerns (a likely
limitation on the judge’s prerogatives, given the law regarding national
security letters, discussed below), and if Congress is given only general
data or trivial bits of information about the surveillance program (which
is usually the case),47 then the typical subpoena process—which allows the
target to challenge the relevance of the information, either immediately or
after delayed notice—is likely to be at least as protective, and is certainly
more likely to deter or expose abuses. In any event, neither Section 215 nor
the typical subpoena process requires probable cause or even reasonable
suspicion, if the latter term requires an articulable suspicion that there is
a nontrivial (i.e., 30 percent) chance that the targeted individual’s records
will provide evidence of crime.
When the FBI seeks a particular subset of “tangible items”—electronic
or communication billing records, ﬁnancial records, or credit records—in
connection with a national security investigation, even a Section 215 order
is not needed. Rather, all it must do is issue a form of administrative sub-
poena known as a national security letter (NSL), in which a special agent in
charge (in other words, a ﬁeld agent) certiﬁes that the information sought
is relevant to an investigation designed to protect against international
terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.48 This type of authorization
is akin to the extrajudicial certiﬁcation discussed in connection with law
enforcement efforts to seek public documents under the Privacy Act, but
with the same gag order that applies to Section 215 orders.49
The Patriot Act allowed this extrajudicial process with respect to ﬁnan-
cial information only when that information was held by banks. However,
in December 2003, that power was expanded by the Intelligence Autho-
rization Act of 2003, which was passed by Congress as part of an appropri-
ations bill with no vetting by the Judiciary Committee and no debate on
the ﬂoor or in the media.50 The 2003 Act allows the FBI to use extrajudicial

certiﬁcation to obtain statements and records from any ﬁnancial institution
“whose cash transactions have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax
or regulatory matters,” including banks, stockbrokers, car dealers, casinos,
credit card companies, insurance agencies, jewelers, pawn brokers, travel
agents, and airlines.51
At one time, all this information could be obtained by the government
simply on its say-so. In 2004, however, a federal district court judge de-
clared the NSL scheme unconstitutional to the extent it immunized NSLs
from judicial process and prevented third-party recordholders from chal-
lenging an order,52 and in 2005 another court expressed similar concerns.53
Those decisions, combined with congressional unease about the scope of
the program—particularly as it applied to libraries—led to several amend-
ments to the Patriot Act. Libraries are now exempted from its provisions,54
and third parties are permitted to ask a court to set aside or modify NSLs
when they are “unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise unlawful” as well
as challenge any accompanying gag order.55
Again, however, the new judicial review power is relatively toothless.
In Doe v. Ashcroft, the ﬁrst decision ﬁnding the NSL procedure defective,
the court indicated that review of an NSL would be limited to whether “the
underlying investigation was not duly ‘authorized,’ was initiated ‘solely on
the basis of activities protected by the ﬁrst amendment to the Constitution
of the United States,’ or did not involve ‘international terrorism or clan-
destine intelligence activities.’ ”56 Indeed, the court stated, “the standard
of review for administrative subpoenas similar to NSLs is so minimal that
most such NSLs would likely be upheld in court.”57 The procedure for
reviewing gag orders is similarly illusory, since if the FBI certiﬁes that
disclosure would “interfere” with a criminal or national security investiga-
tion or endanger someone, the court must abide by that decision.58 In any
event, neither review procedure is triggered unless a third party wants to
take the trouble to initiate it. Evidence suggests that virtually no such chal-
lenges occur.59 The pallid nature of these protections was demonstrated
in March 2007, when the inspector general of the Department of Justice
disclosed that the FBI managed to violate even the Patriot Act’s minimal
NSL procedural requirements in thousands of cases.60
Section 215 is apparently used relatively sparingly, with the Justice De-
partment stating in late 2005 that it had relied on the provision only thirty-
ﬁve times during the preceding two years, in aid of its efforts to gain access
to information about matters such as apartment leases, driver’s licenses,
and ﬁnancial dealings.61 Given the fact that NSLs can authorize the acquisi-
tion of much of the same information, this ﬁnding is not surprising. Indeed,

NSLs are used quite frequently. The FBI alone issues roughly 30,000 to
50,000 NSLs a year and maintains all the records thereby obtained (even
when they are not linked to terrorism).62
Summary of Transaction Surveillance Law
Transaction surveillance has spawned a wide array of new regulatory
schemes, which are usefully summarized by locating them within the stan-
dard Fourth Amendment hierarchy. As the reader well knows by now, the
most protective type of authorization is the warrant, based on probable
cause. Although interception of the content of communications and physi-
cal surveillance of the home both require a warrant, no type of transaction
surveillance requires this most demanding form of authorization. The next
type of authorization in the hierarchy, at least in theory, is an order based
on reasonable suspicion, or what could be called a Terry order, after the
stop and frisk case that ﬁrst recognized this degree of justiﬁcation. Again,
none of the statutory provisions described here (or any other regulatory
regime for that matter) mandates this type of order; it is included for
the sake of comprehensiveness and because it is important to the regu-
latory scheme proposed below. After a Terry order comes the traditional
subpoena, issued upon a judicial ﬁnding of relevance and challengeable
by the target. This is the ﬁrst type of authorization that plays a role in
transaction surveillance; subpoenas are required to access most medical,
ﬁnancial, and stored e-mail records.
Below the traditional subpoena is the delayed-notice subpoena, which
temporarily authorizes unobstructed access to ﬁnancial records and stored
e-mail when a traditional subpoena might frustrate the investigation. Next
is the ex parte subpoena (unchallengeable by the target), which allows
access to many types of customer records held by third parties, includ-
ing phone and ISP account records. Then comes the certiﬁcation (judicial
rubber-stamp) order, which authorizes use of pen registers, trap and trace
devices, and other forms of transaction-oriented snoopware, as well as
access to many types of tangible items thought to be relevant to national
security investigations.63 At the bottom of the authorization totem pole
is the extrajudicial certiﬁcation, which permits access to public records,
ISP billing records, and many types of ﬁnancial information relevant to
national security investigations. Finally, no authorization is needed to ac-
cess public records that come from a state with no privacy statute or that
are accumulated by a commercial data broker. The chart below shows the
eight levels of authorization.

One last important aspect of these statutory authorization mechanisms
should be emphasized: all of them lack a meaningful remedy. Exclusion is
explicitly rejected as a recourse under ECPA and related statutes, admin-
istrative sanctions are rare, and a lawsuit will be dismissed unless tangible
damage is shown.64
II. A Proposal for Regulation of Transaction Surveillance
The differences between the various types of authorization outlined above
are sometimes subtle, but one thing is certain: their number goes well be-
yond (and below) the traditional three-tiered approach of probable cause,
reasonable suspicion, and relevance determinations challengeable by the
targetofthe investigation. As aconceptual matter, a system that recognizes
more than three authorization levels is not necessarily ﬂawed; indeed, the
proportionality framework advanced in chapter 2 contemplates four levels.
My quarrel with current law is not with the general approach but with the
order and substance of the hierarchy.

The degree to which transaction surveillance is regulated should not
depend on whether the information sought is intercepted in real time or is
stored, or on whether it may be related to terrorist actions or some other
crime. Rather, following the proportionality principle, the key variable
should be the intrusiveness of the surveillance. The discussion below pur-
sues this point by providing further theoretical and empirical perspectives
on what privacy means in connection with transactional information and
then proposing speciﬁc rules for protecting it under the Fourth Amend-
ment.
The Case for a Hierarchy of Records
Because the Supreme Court appears to have adopted the position that
both corporate records and individual records held by third parties fall
outside the zone of privacy, the case law is not much help on the subject of
whether and to what extent particular transactional information is private
for Fourth Amendment purposes. However, a few lower courts have been
willing to resist the broad language in Miller and grant Fourth Amendment
protection (or protection under the analogous state constitutional provi-
sion) to some types of records. Stephen Henderson’s survey of the case law
identiﬁes more than a dozen factors the courts have considered,65 principal
among them: (1) the extent to which disclosure of the information is nec-
essary to function in society (with one court, for instance, distinguishing
between phone numbers maintained by the phone company and informa-
tion given to a locksmith);66 (2) the degree to which the information is
personal (with one court holding that power consumption records are not
personal);67 and (3) the amount of information obtained (with some courts
distinguishing between monthly bank or telephone records and a record
of one transaction).68
On an abstract level, these are sensible criteria for evaluating Fourth
Amendment privacy. But applying them in a judicious manner is another
matter. Putting aside the number of variables involved (Henderson him-
self insists that at least nine of the twelve factors he discusses are rele-
vant to Fourth Amendment analysis),69 the indeterminacy of the three
just described should be apparent. The ﬁrst, which looks at how impor-
tant a given service is to modern life, triggers real quandaries: using the
case noted above as an example, why are locksmiths any less essential
to functioning in today’s world than phones, given the need for security
and the frequency with which people are locked out of home, ofﬁce, or

car? Also daunting is the task of calibrating the extent to which particular
information is “personal”; as chapter 3 noted, the Supreme Court in Kyllo
explicitly avoided this type of question on the ground it could not be an-
swered coherently, a difﬁculty brought home by the fact that in the power
consumption case noted above, four judges vigorously dissented from the
conclusion that electricity usage information is not personal70 (and in any
event, isn’t electricity just as crucial to everyday functioning as a phone?).
An equally perplexing question, raised by the third factor, is the number
of transactions a record must contain before its seizure by the government
implicates the Fourth Amendment.
Admittedly, any attempt to assess privacy in a meaningful fashion will
run into these types of deﬁnitional conundrums (as my proposal below
demonstrates). A more fundamental problem is that privacy may not be
measurable in the predominately normative terms these courts are apply-
ing. Chapter 4 noted Robert Post’s conclusion that the scope of privacy,
when conceptualized as a form of dignity, is dependent on everyday social
practices. In an article about expectations of privacy in the tort context,
Lior Strahilevitz agrees that, given the highly contestable nature of the
concept, any effort to arrive at an objectively neutral take on privacy is
“doomed.”71 Instead Professor Strahilevitz argues that, at least for pur-
poses of deﬁning privacy torts, the law’s approach to privacy should derive
primarily from empirical investigation of social norms.
The type of empirical work Strahilevitz has in mind for this purpose
focuses on how we “network” socially. His reading of the social network
literature indicates that unless it is “likely to be regarded as highly inter-
esting, novel, revealing, or entertaining,” information that we reveal about
ourselves rarely gets past “two degrees of separation”—that is, beyond a
friend of a friend.72 This limited range of disclosure is partly the result
of routine inefﬁciencies in communication. But it would exist even if the
Internet were to radically reduce these inefﬁciencies, because people sim-
ply don’t care about the private affairs of strangers unless the events are
dramatic or are somehow economically useful. Based on these types of
insights from social network research, Strahilevitz offers an even more
precise deﬁnition of privacy:
Although the studies vary somewhat, it appears that the median adult has met or
otherwise interacted with approximately 1,700 people. This does not mean that
the average person has 1,700 active ties, but rather that he “knows” roughly this
number of people. . . . To determine whether someone has a reasonable expec-

tation of privacy in information, we therefore might evaluate the possibility that
the information will be disseminated to a number of people that exceeds the size
of his social network. If there is a low risk of such dissemination (for example,
lower than 5 percent), the courts can recognize a reasonable expectation of
privacy.73
The implications of social network theory for transaction surveillance
is straightforward. Unless it is part of a public record designed for con-
sumption by everyone or describes an activity observed by strangers, the
transactional information government seeks through such surveillance is
rarely known outside our families, much less outside our social network
(aside from the third-party institutions to which we provide it). Expecta-
tions that such information will remain “private” are reasonable from the
social network perspective.
Further empirical support for an enlarged view of privacy in individual
records is provided by a study I conducted of lay views (N = 76), similar in
structure to the survey of attitudes toward camera surveillance reported
in chapter 4 but using scenarios related to transactional information (see
table below). For present purposes, the most important result of this study
is that the participants considered many types of transaction surveillance
to be more intrusive than pat downs (which require reasonable suspicion)
and searches of cars (which require probable cause). Consistent with the
lower court cases described above, the participants distinguished between
the types of information obtained (e.g., credit card records, M = 75.3, as
opposed to electricity consumption records, M = 57.4), and surveillance
that is isolated as opposed to aggregating (compare scenario 14, obtaining
a record of a speciﬁc phone call, M = 59.8, with scenario 17, obtaining
a person’s composite phone records, M = 74.1). Participants also distin-
guished between event-driven surveillance (indicated in the table by “data
mining”) and target-driven surveillance of the same types of information
(recall from chapter 1 that event-driven surveillance aims at identifying
the perpetrator of a past or future event, as distinct from target-driven
surveillance, which starts with a suspect). Such distinctions notwithstand-
ing, all these government actions, as well as searches of corporate and
public records, were perceived as more intrusive than a roadblock (see
scenario 1), which is governed by the Fourth Amendment.
These empirical observations suggest that, contrary to the Supreme
Court’s insinuation in cases like Miller and Smith, transferring informa-
tion to third parties or allowing third parties to accumulate it does not, by

itself, lessen the intrusiveness of government efforts to obtain it. To the
members of society queried in this survey, the important variable appears
to be the nature of the record, not who or what institution possesses it.
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence ought to recognize society’s expecta-
tion, whether measured directly or through social network research, that
this type of information is private.
At the same time, the empirical observations from my study, and to a
lesserextentthelogicofsocialnetworktheory,suggestthatsocietydoesnot
view all transactional surveillance as equally intrusive. More speciﬁcally,
the ﬁndings summarized in the survey table above suggest three broad
categories of intrusiveness, divided by scenario 8 (a police stop demand-

ing identiﬁcation, which verges on being a seizure)74 and scenario 16 (a
pat down, which requires reasonable suspicion).75 Into the ﬁrst category
(scenarios 2 though 7) fall government acquisition of corporate records,
public records, and many types of data mining. These types of transaction
surveillance are all ranked lower than the street identiﬁcation scenario, al-
though still above a roadblock. At the other end of the spectrum (scenarios
17 through 25) are government efforts to obtain many types of informa-
tion maintained by private entities, including records of phone and e-mail
correspondents, Web sites visited, credit card purchases, and pharmacy
and bank records. These types of transaction surveillance are all ranked as
more intrusive than a pat down and about as intrusive as either a car search
(scenario 19) or a search of a bedroom (scenario 25), both of which require
probable cause. Between the identiﬁcation check and pat-down scenarios
are several types of transaction surveillance: acquisition of what might be
called “quasi-private” records from clubs, electric companies, high schools,
and grocery stores (scenarios 9, 11, 12, and 15); private records depicting
a single event (scenario 14); and data mining of private records (scenarios
10 and 13).
Because privacy is as much a positive construct as a normative one,
information about societal views such as those depicted in the table above
should be taken into account in ﬁguring out how to apply the Fourth
Amendment to transaction surveillance. Indeed, the proportionality prin-
ciple introduced in chapter 2 requires recognition of differences in in-
trusiveness, which these ﬁndings help us deduce. Any general scheme of
regulation should also take into account the implications of the exigency
principle introduced in chapter 2. Consistent with that principle, ex parte
subpoenas, certiﬁcation orders, and extrajudicial certiﬁcations should be
insufﬁcient authority to carry out nonconsensual searches and seizures for
nonorganizational transaction information unless there is an emergency,
and then only if eventually subject to judicial review.
Assuming the types of results summarized in the survey table are repli-
cated, application of these principles might in turn produce the following
concrete (and admittedly somewhat complex) rules. In the absence of ex-
igency, the government should have to obtain one of four levels of autho-
rization, depending on the type of surveillance: (1) a traditional subpoena
based on relevance, for corporate records; (2) an ex ante court order based
on relevance, for public records and event-driven surveillance of public
and quasi-private records; (3) a Terry order, based on reasonable suspi-
cion, for quasi-private records sought through target-driven surveillance

and private records obtained through event-driven surveillance; and (4) a
warrant based on probable cause, for private records through target-driven
surveillance. The following chart summarizes this proposal.

Under this scheme, organizational records are distinguished from in-
dividual records, individual records are divided into public, quasi-private,
and private categories, and target-driven surveillance is distinguished from
event-driven surveillance. When organizational records or public records
are sought, only relevance is required. When quasi-private records are
sought, relevance is required for event-driven surveillance and reasonable
suspicion for target-driven surveillance. When private records are sought,
reasonable suspicion is required for event-driven surveillance and proba-
ble cause for other target-driven surveillance. Below I ﬂesh out these rules
and suggest how to simplify their application for law enforcement ofﬁcers
and the courts.
Organizational versus Individual Records
The important distinctions between organizational and individual records
have already been discussed in chapter 6; here they will only be sum-
marized. Many of the justiﬁcations for the current relaxed state of trans-
action surveillance are persuasive in the context in which subpoenas ﬁrst

committed by or within a business or other regulated organization. As the
Supreme Court has recognized on numerous occasions and the results of
the survey conﬁrm (see scenario 6 in the survey table), records of busi-
nesses and similar entities are associated with a minimal degree of privacy,
given their impersonal nature and the high degree of state regulation to
which organizations are subject. And, as the Court has also pointed out in
several cases, investigation of economic crimes and regulatory violations
would be extremely difﬁcult without ready access to documents detailing
business activity.
Neither the diminished-privacy rationale nor the heightened-need jus-
tiﬁcation is as easily applied when the records sought involve individuals,
however. Both the normative analysis provided earlier and the empirical
ﬁndings described in this chapter debunk the Supreme Court’s assertion in
Miller that we can’t reasonably expect privacy in connection with personal
information surrendered to third parties. And the self-serving contention
thatcauserequirementsmustberelaxedwhentheyarehardtomeetshould
be taken seriously only in extreme cases. While such cases may often ex-
ist in connection with organizational crime investigations, where the only
evidence may be documentary and even victims may not realize a crime
has occurred, they are rare where nonorganizational crime is involved, and
thus the heightened-need rationale should be irrelevant in that setting.
If one accepts these arguments, then it is important to separate individ-
ual from organizational documents. Fortunately, as chapter 6 explained,
the Supreme Court has done much work in this regard, in the course of
deﬁning the concept of a “collective” entity and the notion of “required
records” for purposes of determining when there is a Fifth Amendment
right to resist documentary subpoenas. In essence, in its collective entity
cases the Court concluded that the records of any organization that has
an identity separate from its individual members lie outside the “zone of
privacy.” In its required records cases, the Court similarly held that the
government may force individuals to keep and disclose documents (such
as, perhaps, tax records) that are crucial for regulating their activities and
that have “assumed ‘public aspects’ which render [them] at least analogous
to public documents.”76 Consistent with these two lines of cases, records
that pertain to a collective entity or that individuals are required to keep
(and are sought for the reason the records are required to be kept) ought
to be accessible on mere issuance of a subpoena.
Outside of the required records context, however, records about
individuals should presumptively receive more protection. The Fourth
Amendment speciﬁcally speaks of searches of papers, as well as searches

of persons, houses, and effects, and it usually requires probable cause for
these searches. Accordingly, a search for records about individuals that
individuals are not required to keep should require probable cause unless
the intrusion associated with the search is less serious than that associated
with search of a house, person, or effect. The following sections explore
three such situations, based on empirical considerations and normative
analysis.
Private versus Public Records
One possible distinction among individual records, suggested by both so-
cial network theory and the survey results, focuses on whether they are
public in nature, not in the ﬁctionalized sense contemplated by the re-
quired records doctrine, but in the sense that they are truly in the public
domain. Much of the information held in courthouse records and other
government ﬁle systems is meant to be available to everyone and can no
longer be said to be controlled by either the individual or the recordholder.
The survey participants seemed to agree, given the low ranking they as-
signed government accessing of criminal records (scenario 4, M = 36.2)
and real estate records (scenario 7, M = 45.5), below even a brief street
identiﬁcation (M = 49.1). In such cases, proportionality reasoning leads
to the conclusion that something less than probable cause or reasonable
suspicion ought to be sufﬁcient justiﬁcation for permitting government
access in these situations.
That does not mean that these records should be available to ofﬁcers
at their whim, however. The participants ranked all of these public record
scenarios above a roadblock. This result probably reﬂects the intuition that
a curious ofﬁcer should not be permitted to sift through the personal data
found in divorce papers, real estate documents, and court proceedings, or
pay a commercial data broker for such information, without a speciﬁc need
to do so. Further, consistent with the exigency principle, that articulation
should take place beforehand to a judge or at least, as the Privacy Act
provides, to a politically accountable ofﬁcial, rather than, as occurs under
current practice, whenever a cop can obtain the data from a broker.
A common complaint about such an approach is that it places more lim-
its on government ofﬁcials than on members of the public, who can access
public records at will and, with the advent of Internet search services and
commercial data brokers, can do so more easily than ever before. But most
of the time the public seeks public information only when it has a speciﬁc

need for it (akin to a relevance standard). More important, the govern-
ment’s resources and power are so much more signiﬁcant, and its hunger
for information so much more voracious (especially post-9/11), that its po-
tential for abusing personal information far exceeds anything individuals
orevencorporationsmightdo.Thephrase“TotalInformationAwareness,”
the name of the now defunct government data-mining program (discussed
further below), describes a goal to which only a government agency could
aspire.77
Private versus Quasi-Private Records
The paradigmatic examples of private records, whether held by the sub-
ject or a third party, are clear from the survey: medical records, bank
records, and envelope information (i.e., records describing one’s phone
and computer communications). In previous work, written without beneﬁt
of empirical information about societal attitudes, I proposed that envelope
information be accorded minimal Fourth Amendment protection.78 I have
now changed my view on this matter, given the consistently high rating the
survey participants give such information (see scenarios 17, 18, 21, and 23)
as well as scholarly criticism of my position.79
The survey results also suggest, however, that the mere fact that a
record is held by a private entity does not automatically mean govern-
ment attempts to obtain it are perceived as highly intrusive. For instance,
the participants viewed transaction surveillance of club membership lists,
electricity readings, and grocery store records (scenarios 9, 11, and 15) as
less intrusive than a pat down (although more intrusive than a street iden-
tiﬁcation stop). These results can be justiﬁed on normative grounds as well.
The detail disclosed in a club membership is not much different from what
police discover through an ID check, and electricity and food consumption
records generally reveal less about one’s lifestyle than information found
in phone or bank records. In short, membership, utility, and store records
might all be called quasi-private, and accordingly, under proportionality
reasoning, reasonable suspicion may be all that that is needed to obtain
such information.
Just as not all records held by private entities are equally private, not
all information held by public agencies should be classiﬁed as public.80
For instance, the survey participants ranked government acquisition of
public high school records in the middle tier (see scenario 12, M = 58.3),
suggesting that reasonable suspicion should be required here even though

such records are held by a public entity. Consider also the treatment of
“public” records under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
and similar state statutes. While these laws establish a presumption in favor
of disclosure of records held by government agencies, they do so primarily
as a means of increasing government transparency and facilitating social
transactions such as real estate deals.81 Thus, they usually exempt from
disclosure a wide array of “personal” records. Under the federal statute,
for example, government agencies must resist a FOIA request for “com-
mercial or ﬁnancial information obtained from a person and privileged or
conﬁdential,”82 “personnel and medical ﬁles and similar ﬁles the disclo-
sure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy,”83 and law enforcement records to the extent they include infor-
mation that “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy.”84 State freedom of information statutes or
interpretive case law protects various other types of records. For instance,
Florida exempts from unrestricted disclosure some types of motor vehicle
registration information, identifying information relating to health care
provided by the state, credit information held by state agencies, and edu-
cational records.85 In many states some types of licensing information are
also exempt from disclosure.86
When federal or state law indicates that information found in govern-
ment records should be withheld despite the strong interest in freedom
of information, it probably should be considered nonpublic for Fourth
Amendment purposes as well. If so, law enforcement should have to
demonstrate more than mere relevance in such cases. Whether reason-
able suspicion or probable cause is required would depend on whether the
information sought is private (as with medical reports) or quasi-private
(as in school records).
A ﬁnal type of record that might be classiﬁed as quasi-private is one
that describes only a single event or a few events. Scenario 14 in the sur-
vey, which involved seeking a record of a phone call from a particular
person to a particular number on a particular day (M = 59.8), was rated as
signiﬁcantly more intrusive than an ID check (M = 49.1) but signiﬁcantly
less intrusive than a pat down (M = 71.5). Thus, in contrast to the lower
court rulings holding that no search occurs in this situation, a proportion-
ality approach would require some level of suspicion before such a record
could be acquired; at the same time, the empirical results suggest that this
level should be no higher than reasonable suspicion.
Here, however, I would favor requiring probable cause, primarily to

avoid the aggregation conundrum. While the difference between one call
and a month’s worth of calls is fairly obvious (particularly if the creation of
personality mosaics is the primary concern), the difference between one
call and four is not, and the difﬁculty of drawing a meaningful line any-
wherealongthisspectrumisapparent.Thereisanormativejustiﬁcationfor
this unitary approach as well: records such as those memorializing phone
communications ought to be treated as private regardless of the amount
of information they hold, since any given single event (e.g., a phone call
to a lover or a psychiatrist) can be as revealing as multiple events. The
same analysis would apply to quasi-private records such as store purchases;
although acquisition of data regarding one purchase can be seen as less
intrusive than acquisition of records depicting a month’s purchases (and
thus perhaps permissible on a relevance rather than reasonable suspicion
showing), there is no sensible dividing point between the two.
Proportionality reasoning based on empirical results can become com-
plicated. But if the aggregation conundrum is addressed in the manner
proposed above, application of the proportionality test is quite manage-
able. The two ends of the privacy spectrum are relatively easy to discern.
Privaterecordsrevealinformationaboutcommunicationsandmedicaland
ﬁnancial activities. Public records are meant to be available to the public.
Quasi-private records are everything else.87
Event-Driven Surveillance and Data Mining
The discussion until now has focused on target-based surveillance. Event-
driven surveillance, designed to discover the actual or would-be perpetra-
tor of a criminal event rather than to pursue an identiﬁed suspect, may
raise different concerns. As with target-driven surveillance, proportional-
ity reasoning suggests a nuanced approach.
First consider relatively benign versions of event-driven surveillance. To
repeat the hypothetical examples given in chapter 1, this type of surveil-
lance might involve tracking down people who have bought a type of shoe
or sweater that has been linked to a sniper incident or individuals who have
rented small planes near a shopping mall suspected of being a terrorist tar-
get. Another example, this one from an actual rape investigation, involved
a computer search of residential records to discover the identities of males
who lived in both Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Fort Collins, Colorado,
at the time several sexual assaults with the same modus operandi occurred
in those two cities.88

In these examples, the information sought (purchases and residential
information) comes from public or quasi-private records. Furthermore,
in contrast to many types of transaction surveillance, the government ac-
quires only one or two bits of information about the persons so identiﬁed
(e.g., that they bought a particular type of shoe, rented a plane on a given
day, or lived in a certain city during a certain period). Finally, the informa-
tion has not been obtained in single-minded pursuit of a particular person
but rather in an effort to determine whom to pursue; any given individual’s
record is merely one of hundreds or thousands and will be discarded or
ignored if it does not interest investigators. For all these reasons, this in-
vestigative technique is a far cry from the creation of personality mosaics
through data aggregation, the scenario that has worried those who criticize
large-scale transaction surveillance. Consistent with this intuition, the sur-
vey participants rated these types of event-driven surveillance, depicted
in scenarios 2 and 3, as less intrusive than an ID check. Both of these
scenarios involved quasi-private records (airline passenger lists and store
patron lists) that recount actions observed by multiple strangers outside
one’s social network.
Sometimes, however, event-driven surveillance involves accessing in-
formation that is more private in nature. In the past decade, the govern-
ment has become increasingly interested in acquiring and analyzing vast
amounts of personal data using a number of different processes known
collectively as data mining. Today the federal government alone proba-
bly operates more than 200 data-mining programs, at least 120 of which
involve efforts to obtain personal information such as credit reports and
credit card transaction records.89
Some of these programs are target driven, either in the sense already
discussed (as with the TALON and REVEAL programs that seek to ac-
quire ﬁnancial records of suspects) or in the sense known as data match-
ing, which might involve trying to match a particular person’s DNA or
ﬁngerprints to a national database or checking the name of a particular
person entering the country against watch lists to determine immigration
or national security status.90 Under proportionality reasoning, regulation
of the ﬁrst type of target-driven data mining would depend on the nature
of the records being accessed. Regulation of data matching, in contrast,
would depend on the nature of the action the government contemplates
taking when a match occurs. If, for example, the consequence of being on
a no-ﬂy list is arrest, a person should not appear on the list unless probable
cause exists to believe the individual is a dangerous criminal. If the con-

sequence is instead a prohibition on boarding, reasonable suspicion might
be sufﬁcient.91
Event-driven data mining, sometimes called pattern-based data mining,
is a somewhat newer development. But as Daniel Steinbock has noted, it
hasalready helped “uncover unreported crimes, identify suspects, [and] aid
investigators in tracing irregular ﬁnancial transactions,”92 and of course
it ﬁgures prominently in attempts to detect planned terrorist activity, as
evidenced by the new ADVISE program described at the beginning of
this chapter.93 The central issue raised by this type of program is whether
Fourth Amendment analysis changes when large-scale event-driven data
mining accesses private, as opposed to public and quasi-private, records.
To understand this issue better, consider in more detail a few examples
of event-driven data-mining programs. The defunct Terrorism Information
Awareness (TIA) program, at one time called Total Information Aware-
ness, consisted of a number of operations designed to gather vast amounts
of information useful to targeting terrorist activity. The program had three
articulated goals: (1) to increase access to counterterrorism information
“by an order of magnitude” (to be accomplished through the Genisys
program); (2) to accumulate “patterns that cover at least 90 percent of
all known previous foreign terrorists attacks” and “automatically cue an-
alysts based on partial pattern matches” (the objective of the Evidence
Extraction and Link Discovery program); and (3) to “support collabora-
tion, analytical reasoning, and information sharing so analysts can hypoth-
esize, test, and propose theories and mitigating strategies about possible
futures” (to be implemented through the previous two programs and the
Scalable Social Network Analysis algorithms program).94 Put in plain Eng-
lish, TIA was an attempt to use computers to sift through a large number
of databases containing credit card purchases, tax returns, driver’s license
data, work permits, and travel itineraries to discover or apply patterns
predictive of terrorist activity.
Although Congress signiﬁcantly limited TIA’s reach in 2003, the rele-
vant legislation still permits the Defense Department, after “appropriate
consultation with Congress,” to pursue data mining of records on Amer-
icans as well as foreign citizens, for the purpose of gathering information
relevant to law enforcement investigations as well as foreign intelligence.95
The department and related government agencies have taken full advan-
tage of this authority, as evidenced by the disclosure in May 2006 that
the National Security Agency has accumulated the phone records of mil-
lions of Americans so that it can conduct “link analysis,” another term for

pattern-based data mining.96 The NSA, Time magazine reported, is trying
to “whittle down the hundreds of millions of phone numbers harvested to
hundreds of thousands that ﬁt certain proﬁles it ﬁnds interesting; those in
turn are cross-checked with other intelligence databases to ﬁnd, perhaps,
a few thousand that warrant more investigation.”97
Relying on Miller, proponents of large-scale data mining have insisted
on its legality even when private records are accessed. The survey partici-
pants, however, were leery of this type of data mining, ranking it as more
intrusive than an ID check, whether aimed at multiple record sets (see sce-
nario 13, involving data mining of phone, credit card, and travel records)
or only one (see scenario 10, involving data mining of phone records).
Assuming this ﬁnding accurately represents society’s views, proportion-
ality reasoning would suggest that event-driven surveillance of private
records be permitted only if there is at least reasonable suspicion. Given
the group nature of the surveillance, that would mean the government’s
proﬁle should achieve roughly a 30 percent hit rate that useful evidence
will be discovered.98
Proponents of the NSA program would likely resist this type of restric-
tion by claiming that the program is necessary to stem the threat posed
by terrorism. In some cases, that claim is a relevant one; consistent with
the danger exception described in chapter 2, the showing usually required
under proportionality analysis could be relaxed when the government can
demonstrate that the data mining is necessary to detect a signiﬁcant immi-
nent threat.99 Outside of the emergency context, however, proportionality
reasoning would more strictly regulate data mining of private records than
does current law.
While it thus imposes greater restrictions on data mining than presently
apply, the upshot of proportionality reasoning is that event-driven surveil-
lance would not be as stringently monitored as target-driven surveillance.
Event-driven surveillance of private records would require only reason-
able suspicion, and event-driven surveillance of quasi-private and public
records could be carried out on a relevance showing. But it should also be
noted that even the latter requirement would be difﬁcult to meet in many
event-driven data-mining contexts. For instance, as several commentators
have pointed out,100 given the small number of terrorists in the United
States, application of a highly accurate proﬁle is likely to produce a very
high ratio of false positives (nonterrorists identiﬁed as terrorists) to true
positives (actual terrorists) if millions of records have to be sifted in the
process. Barring an emergency, then, many of the government’s antiter-

rorism data-mining efforts aimed at domestic records might fail to meet
the relevant threshold.
The government might be able to ﬁnesse this problem by keeping the re-
sults of initial data-mining passes anonymous—using pseudonyms or non-
human (computerized) techniques—until it produces a group for which it
has the requisite cause. This latter type of multistage analysis—sometimes
called “selective revelation”—is technologically feasible (and was viewed
as relatively unintrusive in the survey, as indicated by the ranking of sce-
nario 4 involving anonymous acquisition of personal information). But
it is largely untested in most law enforcement contexts.101 Furthermore,
stringent auditing procedures would need to be in place to ensure the
government didn’t cheat by prematurely linking the ﬁles with names or
hacking into the computerized investigation.102
A separate concern about event-driven data mining is that because it
can cast such a wide net, it is easier to manipulate in the service of illegiti-
mate ends. In particular, it might facilitate both harassment of disfavored
groups (for instance, when race is an element of a data-mining proﬁle or
when government ofﬁcials choose to interview only the Arab individu-
als who ﬁt a particular proﬁle) and pretextual searches for evidence of
nonproﬁled crimes that the government would otherwise have difﬁculty
discovering or proving (known as “mission creep” among data-mining aﬁ-
cionados). When so used, data mining may be unreasonable under the
Fourth Amendment or illegal under some other constitutional provision.
As argued in chapter 2, proﬁles should not include race, and as chapter
4 contended in connection with camera surveillance, race-based selection
of investigative targets must also be prohibited. And while the Supreme
Court has refused to prohibit pretextual searches altogether, it has also
indicated a willingness to consider pretext arguments under the Fourth
Amendment when searches are grounded on something less than prob-
able cause and thus are more prone to abuse, which would be the case
for event-driven surveillance under the proposed regime.103 Even if that
potential limitation ends up being ignored in other contexts, it should apply
to transaction surveillance. The temptation to misuse records searches is
particularly strong because, unlike physical searches and communications
surveillance, they are not conducted in real time and thus are not space-
or time-limited.
The potential for racism and pretextual actions should not lead, how-
ever, to an absolute prohibition on event-driven data mining. Unfortu-
nately, these improper motivations infect every aspect of criminal justice.

As argued in more detail in chapter 8, the best way to ﬁght them is through
direct sanctions, not elimination of useful investigative techniques.
III. Counterproposals
What does this set of proposals mean for Agent Jones, described back in
chapter 1? Recall that he was contemplating a target-driven investigation
of three different people (a frequent ﬂyer who pays for his tickets with cash,
a free spender with no visible means of support, and a young religious Arab
man)usingvarioustransactionsurveillancetechniques.Joneswouldneeda
court order based on a showing of relevance to access public records about
these individuals through ChoicePoint or one of the other commercial
data brokers. And he would need a warrant based on probable cause to
access the contents of the suspect’s ﬁnancial, medical, and similar personal
records as well as to obtain envelope information such as addresses of the
person’s e-mail correspondents.
If instead the transaction surveillance is event driven, Jones would
merely need to show that any proﬁle he uses is relevant to a legitimate
investigation (one that is not motivated by racial animus or hidden in-
vestigative agendas), unless he seeks private records, in which case he
would also need a proﬁle that would produce a roughly 30 percent hit rate.
Applying this framework to earlier examples, if the government seeks to
ascertain who made certain purchases at a certain store or joined a skydiv-
ing club (public activities), it would be on solid ground if this information is
likely to increase the probability of identifying the perpetrators. If instead
it wanted to obtain a list of who called a particular number or who visited
a particular Web site (nonpublic activities), it would need to demonstrate
an articulable suspicion why the persons who will be so identiﬁed were or
will be criminal actors.
Contrary to the Department of Justice’s stance, none of these rules
should change if government seeks individual information from records
acquired by a commercial data broker that has obtained the data from
the original recordholders. Otherwise, much of this regulation could be
avoided. Information does not become less private simply because it has
been shifted from one entity to another. The crucial questions are whether
the records sought are about an individual or an organization, whether
they are held for private or public purposes, and whether the investigation
is target or event driven.

While this set of rules is not uncomplicated, it recognizes fewer types
of authorizations than the current regime. Outside of the corporate crime
context (the most likely setting in which organizational records will be
sought), the ofﬁcer need merely determine whether the search is target
or event driven and whether the records ﬁt in either the private or public
category (since any record that is neither is quasi-private). Moreover, since
transaction surveillance should generally proceed only pursuant to a court
order, confusion on the detective’s part can be ameliorated by a judge.
One can imagine numerous alternative methods of regulating trans-
action surveillance. The Department of Defense’s Technical and Privacy
Advisory Committee (TAPAC), in its ﬁnal report issued in 2004, recom-
mended that nonanonymized data mining be preceded by authorization
from both the agency head and a court, and also called for minimization
and audit procedures, but did not adopt any particular standard to be ap-
plied by the decision makers.104 The recommendations also exempted from
these requirements any information “that is routinely available without
charge or subscription to the public.”105 While it does not provide as much
protection for transactional information as the proportionality approach
advanced here, TAPAC did recognize a hierarchy of procedures based on
the type of data government is trying to access. If the debate were over
those types of issues, it would at least be on the right track.
Other proposals regarding transaction surveillance, however, ignore
proportionality reasoning as the means of implementing the Fourth
Amendment. Below is an analysis of a few such alternative regimes. While
each may seem appealing initially, each suffers from serious ﬂaws.
Jettisoning Privacy
DanielSolovehasadvancedaregulatoryschemethatisdifferentfromboth
current law and the regime presented here.106 Rather than attempt to ﬁgure
out a privacy hierarchy and match authorization requirements to it (the
proportionality approach that informs this book), he proposes a uniform
regulatory regime for government access to any “system of records.”107
Speciﬁcally, Professor Solove proposes that outside of emergency situa-
tions, government be prohibited from obtaining information in records—
whether it is individual or corporate data, whether it is held by private or
public agencies—unless the government can obtain what he calls a “regu-
lated subpoena.” To obtain such a subpoena the government would have
to demonstrate it has probable cause to believe the person whose records

are sought is involved in criminal activity, and that the speciﬁc records
targeted are of “material importance” to the investigation—a standard he
describes as “slightly more permissive” than the probable cause required
by a warrant, though more demanding than the relevance required for a
subpoena (and, presumably, the reasonable suspicion required for a Terry
order). As with traditional subpoenas, the regulated subpoena would be
challengeable by the target.108
Solove asserts that his scheme is superior to a proportionality approach
in two respects. First, he points to the difﬁculty of differentiating between
degrees of privacy and intimacy, a difﬁculty illustrated by my attempts
to distinguish individual from organizational records, private from public
records,andevent-andtarget-drivensurveillance.Second,evenifwecould
resolve these deﬁnitional problems, Solove believes that making privacy
the linchpin of analysis is conceptually bankrupt. He notes, for instance,
that we would never think of requiring the police investigating a rape case
to secure a warrant before seeking a description of a suspect’s genitals from
his sexual partner, yet that information is probably as “private” as anything
found in one’s medical records. Privacy, Solove argues, is a contextual
concept that cannot form the basis for uniform regulation.109 Rather, in
the transaction surveillance setting, the deciding factor should be whether
the information is maintained in a system of records.110 So, to return to his
example, the police could interview the sexual partner without restriction,
but would need a regulated subpoena to access the medical record of the
suspect for the same information.
I agree with the premise of both of Solove’s arguments, but am less
persuaded that they lead to his conclusion. Solove is right that making
the subtle distinctions demanded by a proportionality approach is difﬁcult
and can result in over- or underprotection of information at the margins.
But requiring probable cause for all record searches, including searches of
corporate and public records, goes too far in the other direction. Moreover,
the effect of Solove’s proposal on law enforcement investigation would be
calamitous. Most obviously, regulation of businesses would come to an
end if regulated subpoenas were required for all records searches. Target-
driven searches of public records, which often occur in the initial stages of
an investigation, would also be very difﬁcult to conduct. And event-driven
surveillance of any sort would be almost impossible. If probable cause
were required for such surveillance, for instance, the sniper-killer, mall-
bombing, and serial sexual assault investigations described earlier might
never get off the ground. Creating a hierarchy of privacy, tricky though it

may be, is important as a means of enabling the balancing of government
and individual interests that the Supreme Court has sanctioned since the
1960s in Terry and related cases.
Similarly, while I agree with Solove that the extent to which we are
willing to protect private information is contextual (as his example of the
sexual partner interview demonstrates), that conclusion does not mean
that privacy should be discarded as the baseline consideration in deter-
mining the government’s authority to obtain information about its citizens.
We should treat witness interviews differently from records requests not
because privacy is irrelevant during witness interviews but because the tar-
get’s interest in privacy is countered by an even stronger interest—the third
party’s autonomy. As discussed in chapter 6, human information sources,
such as the sexual partner, should have a right to decide what to do with
the information they possess; in such cases, the subject’s privacy interest is
outweighed by the source’s autonomy interest. When the third party is an
impersonal recordholder, on the other hand, concerns about denigrating
the third party’s “personhood” through limitations on when information
may be revealed are nonexistent.111 It is the absence of a legitimate third-
party interest in surrendering the target’s private information, not the bare
fact that the information happens to reside in a record, that distinguishes
the records request scenario from the interview setting.
These considerations lead me to conclude, contrary to Solove, that pri-
vacy concerns should be the fundamental consideration in analyzing trans-
action surveillance. While information generally should be accorded more
protection when recorded, the extent of that protection should depend
on the degree of privacy associated with the information, not simply on
whether it exists in record form. Thus, transactional information found
in corporate or truly public records or discovered through event-driven
surveillance should be accessible on less than probable cause.
Controlling Dissemination
Another alternative to the proportionality approach advanced here evades
the issue of whether it is under- or overprotective of privacy by asserting
that it focuses on the wrong sort of privacy invasion. William Stuntz con-
cedes that “secret searches” of our transactional information create risks
that “are worth worrying about.”112 But he contends that we would not
be particularly bothered by easy government access to such information
if we never found out about it except in connection with prosecutions for

serious crime.113 In other words, covert access to and stringent control over
use of transaction information should permit relaxation of the rules as to
how we obtain it.
This ignorance-is-bliss notion is superﬁcially attractive. But limiting in-
formation ﬂow, which is essential to Professor Stuntz’s scheme, can be
very difﬁcult, for reasons alluded to in chapter 4’s discussion of this pro-
posal. The assumption that data gathered by law enforcement can be re-
stricted to a small group of government employees is particularly naive
in the wake of 9/11, when hundreds of thousands of law enforcement
ofﬁcers are charged with ﬁghting “terrorism”—an amorphous threat, to
say the least. Ensuring that the information government ofﬁcials acquire
through covert surveillance is used only for the purpose of prosecuting
serious crime could be equally difﬁcult, precisely because the surveillance
is covert;114 in this context, the potential for mission creep is particularly
acute.115 Finally, abandoning all suspicion requirements, as Stuntz would
do, virtually guarantees that data would be routinely and randomly gath-
ered about large numbers of innocent people, a practice that would likely
increase the chances of government ﬁles containing misleading informa-
tion about its citizens. In contrast, requiring at least a relevance showing
for event-driven surveillance and greater suspicion levels for many types
of target-driven surveillance, as my proposal does, places meaningful limits
on the scope of government efforts to gather transaction evidence.
EveniftheinformationgatheredthroughStuntz’sapproachissomehow
conﬁned to a limited and discreet group and is not misused or inaccurate in
any way, routine suspicionless and covert transaction surveillance can eat
away at whatever trust is left between government and its citizenry. Once
the public becomes aware that random covert surveillance is pervasive,
the panoptic effect of this regime will be greater than occurs with overt
surveillance. Although one poll asking for reaction to the NSA phone-
sweep program described earlier indicated that 63 percent of those sur-
veyed felt that the program was an “acceptable way to ﬁght terrorism,”116
37 percent felt to the contrary, sometimes vigorously so.117 Furthermore,
the latter percentage would undoubtedly climb if covert and unlimited
transaction surveillance were known to be routinely conducted not only by
the Defense Department but by ordinary police agencies solving ordinary
(albeit serious) crimes. Only if the program is able to keep the identity of
the phone callers truly anonymous until its algorithm pinpointed those for
whom the relevant level of cause exists (akin to the contraband-speciﬁc
devices discussed in chapter 5) should it be considered constitutional under
the Fourth Amendment.118

With the power of today’s computers, government could monitor the
transactions of everybody all the time. A regulatory regime that explicitly
endorsed that sort of process would destroy any sense of security people
might have in today’s technological society. Indeed, if government is to be
allowed to ﬁnd out details of our lives whenever it is interested in doing
so, we would probably be more comfortable knowing when it is occurring
rather than being left in the dark.
Relying on the Legislature
A ﬁnal means of regulating transaction surveillance is to leave the task up
to the legislature, speciﬁcally Congress. Orin Kerr has made the most pow-
erful argument for this approach.119 He correctly points out that congres-
sional statutes have provided more protection against transaction surveil-
lance than the Supreme Court’s construal of the Fourth Amendment in
cases like Miller and that, in theory, legislatures are better equipped than
courts to craft clear rules governing transaction surveillance in an era of
rapidly changing, complicated technology.120
But Kerr’s arguments fail to negate two crucial facts about the trans-
action surveillance rules that Congress has enacted to date: the rules have
not been particularly clear,121 and, more important, they do not provide
adequate protection against government access to our personal records.
As evidenced by the passage of legislation in 2006 essentially giving the
president carte blanche antiterrorism authority, even with respect to wire-
tapping,122 Congress is unlikely to alter its stance on transaction surveil-
lance substantially unless the courts, relying on the Fourth Amendment,
nudge it in the right direction.
Will the courts be willing to engage in such nudging? Certainly, Miller,
Smith, and like cases indicate that the Supreme Court is hesitant to do so.
But in more recent decisions applying the special needs doctrine, which
raises parallel issues, the Court has dropped its nonchalant attitude toward
nontraditional searches and seizures and called into question the validity
of both the diminished-privacy and heightened-need rationales for elimi-
nating Fourth Amendment restrictions on transaction surveillance. In Fer-
guson v. City of Charleston, the Court declared unconstitutional a policy
that authorized hospital drug testing of pregnant patients for the purpose
of detecting illegal drug use, over a dissent by Justice Scalia arguing that
under Miller the patients voluntarily assumed the risk that the results of
such tests would be used for investigative purposes.123 The majority in
Ferguson ignored Scalia’s complaint, concluding that a reasonable patient

would assume the test results would be used for diagnostic purposes and
that otherwise they would be kept conﬁdential.124 And in both Ferguson
and Indianapolis v. Edmond, the roadblock case described in chapter 5,
the Court emphasized that individualized cause requirements may not be
relaxed if the only special need pleaded by the government is a “general
interest in law enforcement.”125
Another recent Supreme Court decision, this one outside the special
needs context, registered even stronger qualms about Miller’s assumption-
of-risk analysis. In Georgia v. Randolph,126 the Court held that when one
occupant of a residence consents to entry but another refuses, police must
honor the refusal. Justice David Souter stated for the Court that the rea-
sonableness of a search in this situation “is in signiﬁcant part a function
of commonly held understandings about the authority that co-inhabitants
may exercise in ways that affect each other’s interests,” and concluded
that an invitee would ordinarily not enter in such a situation.127 Based on
an analysis of property law, he also concluded that “there is no common
understanding that one co-tenant generally has a right or authority to
prevail over the express wishes of another.”128 What is important about
the case for present purposes is the majority’s dismissal of Chief Justice
John Roberts’s assertion in dissent, based on Miller and its progeny, that
when “an individual shares information, papers, or places with another,
he assumes the risk that the other person will in turn share access to that
information or those papers or places with the government.”129 Far from
agreeing with this statement, the majority chastised the chief justice for
his “easy assumption that privacy shared with another individual is pri-
vacy waived for all purposes including warrantless searches by police.”130
Roberts averred that with this type of language, Randolph “alters a great
deal of established Fourth Amendment law.”131 Although Roberts was
dismayed by this prospect, I hope he is right.132
Ferguson and Randolph signal that the Court is reluctant to grant the
government an exemption from traditional Fourth Amendment standards
simply because information relevant to a criminal investigation has been
sharedwithorgiventoathirdparty(thusunderminingMiller’sdiminished-
privacy premise). And Ferguson and Edmond suggest that government
claims that relaxation of those standards is necessary to detect criminal
activity will not always prevail (thus undermining the heightened-need ra-
tionale as a ground for reducing Fourth Amendment protections). These
decisions provide a glimmer of hope that, when confronted with cases chal-
lenging subpoenas for personal records about medical treatment, personal

ﬁnances, the contents of e-mail messages, and individual phone logs, the
Court will withdraw from its broad pronouncements in Miller. If it does so,
further, more detailed rule-making along the lines suggested here might
best be left to Congress, for the reasons Kerr suggests. The goal should be
meaningful protection of personal information, whatever its source.
Conclusion
Analysis of government surveillance has tended to focus on communica-
tions and physical surveillance. But transaction surveillance is at least as
pervasive as these other types of investigative techniques and can be as
inimical to privacy interests. Public and private records contain informa-
tion regarding virtually every aspect of our lives. In the past few decades,
technology has made that information inﬁnitely more easily aggregated
and accessible.
Yet neither legislatures nor courts have evidenced much concern about
transaction surveillance. Congress appears to think of transaction infor-
mation as “business records,” and thus at most entitled to the protection
afforded by subpoenas, while the Supreme Court tells us we must assume
the risk that recordholders will betray us. These positions ignore the per-
sonal nature of the information in these records. They also fail to acknowl-
edge that disclosure of that information to recordkeepers—disclosure that
those of us who live a modern lifestyle cannot avoid—is no different, in
expectation of privacy terms, than communicating with others by phone or
e-mail or interacting with others inside one’s home, both activities clearly
protected by the Constitution. As Senator Sam Ervin recognized in 1974,
“Government has an insatiable appetite for power, and it will not stop
usurping power unless it is restrained by laws they cannot repeal or nul-
lify.”133 When it comes to transaction surveillance, only the Fourth Amend-
ment provides that type of restraint.

Conclusion:
A Different Fourth Amendment?
G
overnment surveillance of all types has expanded dramatically since
September 11, 2001. The critical tone of this book should not be
taken as an unconditional condemnation of that development. Commu-
nications surveillance, physical surveillance, and transaction surveillance
are essential tools in combating a whole host of ills, including organized
crime, drug dealers, corrupt government ofﬁcials, technologically savvy
con artists and, last but not least, terrorists fearless of punishment and
even death.
As Benjamin Franklin stated, however, “They that can give up essen-
tial liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor
safety.”1PuttingthissentimentinFourthAmendmentterms,wemustmake
sure we are “secure” from government overreaching as well as from crimi-
nals and our enemies. The Fourth Amendment establishes the method for
resolving this tension by prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures.
One of the two primary theses of this book is that surveillance that is
not regulated is unreasonable under the Constitution. Supreme Court case
law construing the Fourth Amendment, broadly read, allows government
agents to scan our homes with binoculars, continuously track our public
movements with cameras and beepers, and access institutional records of
all our daily activities, at their discretion. It is inconceivable that the drafters
of the Constitution meant government to have such uncabined power. If
that is the import of its decisions, the Supreme Court has done this country
a vast disservice.
This declaration is neither a liberal nor a conservative sentiment. Peo-
ple on both ends of the political spectrum are concerned about the lack

of constitutional controls over government authority to intrude on their
private lives.2 At the same time, liberals as well as conservatives are respon-
sible for the current state of affairs. Not just the conservative post-Warren
Court, with its decisions in cases like Dow Chemical, Knotts, Miller, and
Smith, but the liberal Warren Court, whose undercover agent cases laid
the groundwork for these decisions, warrant criticism for today’s weak
constitutional restrictions on surveillance.
Indeed, the liberal agenda may deserve the most blame for the current
state of affairs. A good case can be made for the initially counterintuitive
position that the most important dogmas of this agenda—speciﬁcally, that
searches must always be bottomed on individualized probable cause and
that unreasonable searches must always result in exclusion of evidence—
are responsible for today’s constitutional nihilism. When a search requires
probable cause to be constitutional, courts are naturally more reluctant to
denominate every police attempt to ﬁnd evidence a search. When suspicion
must be individualized, they are more likely to gloss over the harms caused
by investigations of groups. And when the sole serious sanction for an
illegal search is suppression at trial, many judges have less sympathy for
viable claims because they cannot stomach dismissal of criminal charges
for lack of evidence.
Thus, the second principal thesis of this book, underlying the ﬁrst, is
that Fourth Amendment jurisprudence needs to relinquish its focus on
the traditional probable cause/individualized suspicion model, backed by
a motion for exclusion, as the primary means of protecting individual inter-
ests. Instead, this book argues, Fourth Amendment regulation should ﬂow
from the proportionality and exigency principles, and violation of those
principles should often occasion more direct, less incendiary sanctions than
exclusion. The following three sections revisit the rationale for these views,
using physical and transaction surveillance scenarios as illustrations. Along
the way, the core proposals advanced in this book are summarized.
I. Probable Cause Forever
Of course, probable cause is not required for every police action that is
called a search or seizure. As chapter 2 noted, Terry v. Ohio, a Warren
Court decision, stands for the proposition that detentions short of arrest
and pat downs of outer clothing are permissible on reasonable suspicion.
The Court was willing to relax Fourth Amendment strictures with respect

to stops and frisks because the government’s interest in “effective crime
prevention and detection” on the streets justiﬁed the “brief, though far
from inconsiderable, intrusion upon the sanctity of the person” these ac-
tions occasion.3
In the seizure context, the post-Warren Court has relied on this balanc-
ing approach in approving several types of detentions short of an arrest
on less than probable cause.4 In the search context, however, it has been
much less willing to follow this route. Instead, the Court has insisted, in
the words of Justice Stewart in Katz, that “searches conducted . . . with-
out prior approval by judge of magistrate [and therefore without probable
cause],areperseunreasonableundertheFourthAmendment,subjectonly
to a few speciﬁcally established and well-delineated exceptions.”5 Almost
twenty years later, in New Jersey v. T.L.O., a much more conservative Court
similarly stated, “Ordinarily, a search—even one that may permissibly be
carried out without a warrant—must be based upon ‘probable cause’ to
believe that a violation has occurred.”6
T.L.O. then went on to hold that probable cause was not required to
search a schoolchild’s purse for evidence of disciplinary infractions, in the
course of creating the one major exception (other than Terry’s frisk rule)
to the probable-cause-forever dogma. Called the special needs doctrine,
after a phrase in Justice Blackmun’s concurrence in T.L.O., the exception
requires only that government action be reasonable,7 which in practice
has meant that neither a warrant nor probable cause is required. But the
special needs exception is usually applicable only when those conducting
the government action are pursuing some end other than criminal law
enforcement (such as drug testing for administrative purposes; searches
of schoolchildren’s purses or employees’ desks for disciplinary infractions;
and inspections of gun shops, coal mines, and other businesses for regu-
latory, health, and safety violations). Indeed, the classic statement of the
special needs paradigm is that it kicks in only when “special needs, beyond
the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable-
cause requirement impracticable.”8 The Court has on several occasions
called these special needs situations “exceptional” and “limited.”9 In other
words, outside of frisks, the usual law enforcement search for evidence of
criminal activity requires probable cause.
While that outcome may please many who favor strong Fourth
Amendment protection, its ultimate effect has been just the reverse. As
chapter 2 documented, the consequences of this probable-cause-forever
position have been dramatic: a whole host of intrusive police actions—

ﬂyovers, open ﬁeld trespasses, undercover activity—are now immunized
from Fourth Amendment strictures. This hands-off attitude developed
because, like the stop and frisk at issue in Terry, these types of investiga-
tive techniques are exploratory, based on suspicion rather than probable
cause. Without these techniques, probable cause might never be devel-
oped. When forced to choose between permitting such actions at police
discretion or in effect ending them, even many aggressive civil libertarians
might choose the former route.
Thus, it is no surprise that this has also been the response of most mem-
bers of the Supreme Court, even moderate and liberal ones. For instance,
in holding that the Fourth Amendment does not govern use of undercover
agents to gain entry to the home, Chief Justice Earl Warren himself stated,
“Were we to hold the deceptions of the agent in this case constitutionally
prohibited, we would come near to a rule that the use of undercover agents
in any manner is virtually unconstitutional per se.”10 The Supreme Court
cases most relevant to physical and transaction surveillance are also apt
reﬂections of the dilemma created by the probable-cause-forever position.
Had the Court decided for the defendants in Knotts, Miller, and Smith, for
example, it might have created precedent for banning public tracking of
any individual whom the police couldn’t already arrest and for invalidat-
ing all exploratory subpoenas for third-party records, even though both
practices are crucial ﬁrst-stage law enforcement techniques. That prospect
must have been daunting, for even the “liberal” justices signed on to the
unanimous Knotts opinion, only William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall
wrote dissenting opinions in Miller, and only they plus Stewart dissented
in Smith; moreover, only Marshall was adamant about requiring a warrant
in the latter two cases.11
The damage done by the probable-cause-forever position in the surveil-
lance context does not end with the speciﬁc holdings in these cases. Even
more insidious is the assumption-of-risk rationale that it has spawned, ﬁrst
in the Warren Court in its undercover cases and then in Knotts, Miller, and
Smith. That rationale not only has given carte blanche to public surveil-
lance and third-party subpoenas but also underlies Kyllo’s dictum that
police may use technological means to spy on the interior of homes so
long as the technology is in general public use. The general public use doc-
trine stems directly from the notion that we cannot expect privacy from
technology we should know ordinary people use on a daily basis.
Given these developments, some have argued that the real problem
in these cases is not the probable cause requirement but Katz’s adoption

of privacy as the linchpin of Fourth Amendment analysis. Various other
concepts—among them, government-citizen trust, coercion, and prop-
erty—have been proposed as substitutes. I argued in chapter 2 that none of
these concepts satisfactorily captures the gravamen of the Fourth Amend-
ment. But even assuming one or more of these alternatives is conceptually
viable, there is no reason to believe that any of them would have fared bet-
ter in dealing with the conundrum created by the probable-cause-forever
dogma.
Consider property, probably the most commonly touted substitute for
privacy as the core Fourth Amendment value. Of course, privacy analysis
takes property interests into account; one has more of a privacy interest in
a house one owns or rents than in a house that one temporarily occupies
as a guest. Commentators such as Morgan Cloud, however, want a Fourth
Amendment “rooted in property theories.”12 Cloud prefers this approach
in large part because, he says, property concepts are less “malleable” than
privacy concepts and thus less likely to permit signiﬁcant encroachments
on the Fourth Amendment’s scope.13 But property doctrine is eminently
manipulable as well. For instance, back in the heyday of the property-
oriented approach to the Fourth Amendment, the Court had no problem
permitting suspicionless searches of privately owned open ﬁelds.14 The
deﬁnition of criminal instrumentalities was also stretched beyond recog-
nition so that government could assert a superior possessory interest over
personal property,15 a ploy that would be vastly facilitated today by the
advent of forfeiture statutes giving government an interest in any item
with a nexus to criminal activity.16 Worse yet, under a property-oriented
regime surveillance of any kind could easily be said to be untouched by the
Fourth Amendment, since it does not involve physical trespass.17 In other
words, even had the Court adhered to a property-based Fourth Amend-
ment, it could have (and probably would have) succumbed to the pressure
created by the probable-cause-forever position. And that pressure would
have been particularly hard to resist in the physical and transaction surveil-
lance context, given the amorphous property interests people have in their
public movements and in records kept by third parties.
The allegiance to a unitary probable cause standard has still one other
downside: the minimization of ex ante review as a regulatory option for
searches that don’t require probable cause. As Justice Scalia stated in Grif-
ﬁn v. Wisconsin, “The Constitution prescribes . . . that where the matter is
of such a nature as to require a judicial warrant, it is also of such a nature as
to require probable cause.”18 Conversely, Scalia implied, if probable cause

is not required, neither is ex ante review. Thus, Justice Blackmun’s sug-
gestion, offered in his dissent in Grifﬁn, that the search of a probationer’s
home is reasonable only if authorized by a judge was brusquely dismissed
by the majority once it found that such searches present a special needs
situation outside normal law enforcement.19 According to the majority, a
court order based on less than probable cause is “a combination that nei-
ther the text of the Constitution nor any of our prior decisions permits.”20 If
that is the law in special needs cases, then the idea that a court could issue
an order on mere reasonable suspicion or something less in connection
with normal law enforcement would likely be even more oxymoronic to
the justices who joined this language. Thus, for instance, even if the Court
adopted the notion that public tracking is a search and further permitted
such searches on reasonable suspicion, it would likely resist requiring, in
addition, that police convince a magistrate that the standard was met.
In a variety of ways, then, the probable-cause-forever dogma forces
courts grappling with the realities of law enforcement to exempt many
varieties of surveillance from the Fourth Amendment’s restrictions. That
dogma is not required by the Fourth Amendment, however. Again, the
Fourth Amendment requires only that searches and seizures be reason-
able.
That declaration might conjure up the specter of a Fourth Amendment
swallowed entirely by the special needs exception. But there are other
ways of conceptualizing reasonableness. The proportionality and exigency
principles discussed throughout this book more sensibly implement this
mandate because they ameliorate the pressure created by the probable-
cause-forever stance without sacriﬁcing the core protection of the Fourth
Amendment. The proportionality principle allows courts to modulate the
cause needed to carry out physical and transaction surveillance depending
on its intrusiveness, and the exigency principle ensures that, whenever
there is time to do so, even surveillance authorized on less than probable
cause will be subject to ex ante review by someone not involved in the
search.
Under this regime, courts would be more willing to say that police at-
tempts to ﬁnd evidence are searches because the consequences of such a
holding would not be as dramatic. For instance, undercover work, even if
called a search, might require probable cause only when it involves long-
term inﬁltration.21 Observation of public activities like the tracking that
occurred in Knotts could more easily be denominated a Fourth Amend-
ment event because, for reasons outlined in chapters 4 and 5, such a holding

would not require probable cause for public surveillance unless it is pro-
longed. And all subpoenas for records could more comfortably be called
searches because only subpoenas for personal records like those sought in
Miller or the individual phone log such as that obtained in Smith would
require probable cause; organizational records could be obtained on a
much lesser showing.
Nor would this application of the proportionality principle have re-
quired different results on the speciﬁc facts of Knotts, Miller, and Smith.
The government had probable cause to believe that Miller’s bank records
would prove his involvement in an illegal liquor operation and that Smith’s
phone records would reveal attempts to harass a former victim, and at
least a reasonable suspicion that the purchaser of the beepered can that
eventually led to Knotts was up to no good.22 Under the regime advanced
in this book, the only possible challenge in these cases, and then only in
Knotts and Smith, would be that ex ante review was not sought, in possible
violation of the exigency principle.
Thus, if the proportionality and exigency principles ruled, courts could
more easily avoid the temptation to deﬁne the Fourth Amendment thresh-
old in terms of assumptions of risk, and might be more willing to speak
of that threshold in the terms Katz has always stood for: expectations of
privacy society recognizes as reasonable. This development would ensure
adequate regulation not only of physical surveillance of public movements
such as occurred in Knotts and transaction surveillance of the type involved
in Miller and Smith, but also of physical surveillance of the home. For as
chapter 3 argued, Kyllo’s dictum endorsing the general public use and
naked eye exceptions could never become formal law if the courts viewed
the home in the same way society does (and the Framers did).
Reduction of Fourth Amendment conundrums is not the only reason
the proportionality and exigency principles should be adopted, of course.
Chapter 2 made additional normative arguments in their favor. But partic-
ularly in this age of heightened concern over security, the pragmatic impact
of a Fourth Amendment theory on judicial decision-making is far from an
irrelevant consideration.
II. The Fixation on Individualized Suspicion
Hand in glove with the Court’s probable cause doctrine is the individual-
ized suspicion requirement. As the Court has stated, “A search or seizure

is ordinarily unreasonable in the absence of individualized suspicion of
wrongdoing.”23 That precept is normally a wise one. But it cannot be hon-
ored when large groups of people are subjected to searches or seizures,
like those that occur in connection with roadblocks, drug testing, and,
most relevant to this book, camera surveillance and data mining. In these
situations, an individualized suspicion requirement would stop the govern-
ment’s investigation dead in its tracks.
One response to this quandary is to adhere to the individualized suspi-
cion requirement and simply prohibit group searches. But that solution is
as “unreasonable” as the eradication of ﬁrst-stage investigative techniques
that occurs under a probable-cause-forever stance. Group searches are an
important means of keeping us safe, a fact even liberal justices recognize.24
The Court’s approach, in contrast, has been to determine whether the
group intrusion is a special needs situation. If ordinary law enforcement is
involved, the Court continues to require individualized suspicion.25 In spe-
cial needs situations, however, the Court has been satisﬁed with a bland as-
sertion by the government that the group search or seizure is meant to deal
with an unquantiﬁed problem, such as illegal immigration, drunken driv-
ing, business safety violations, or substance abuse among customs agents
and schoolchildren.26 In other words, just as the probable cause dogma
has encouraged a narrow deﬁnition of search, the individualized suspicion
dogma has left the Court with no tools for dealing with group searches,
with the result that it has essentially adopted a hands-off attitude toward
them (and vastly increased the potential for arbitrary and pretextual police
actions).
The proportionality principle counsels an intermediate approach. It
would permit group searches, but only if, as outlined in previous pages,
there is reason to believe that the proportion of criminals likely to be so
discovered roughly equals the hit rate required by the intrusion involved.
For instance, if the government wants to conduct full searches of everyone
in a group, it should have to show why there is reason to believe that
roughly one out of two of those searches will produce evidence of crime
(unless the danger exception discussed in chapter 2 applies).27 Similarly,
event-driven data mining using personal records of identiﬁable individuals
ought to be able to ﬁnger viable suspects approximately one-third of the
time, given the intrusion involved. Public physical surveillance of large
numbers of people is not as invasive, but in open public areas, where the
right to anonymity is most robust, cameras and other physical surveillance

technology should not be installed unless a demonstrable, concrete threat
is present in the monitored area.28 The “generalized suspicion” notion
operating in these examples provides concrete guidelines for the reason-
ableness inquiry, which otherwise demands only vague assertions of gov-
ernment need, if it is triggered at all (depending on whether the Court
ultimately considers investigative techniques like public camera surveil-
lance and data mining to be searches).
The exigency principle also places limitations on group searches. As
Scalia’s comments in Grifﬁn indicate, the Court’s special needs jurispru-
dence not only jettisons a warrant requirement but appears to abandon
all pretense of ex ante review. The exigency principle, in contrast, would
require such review before all nonexigent group searches, special or not,
just as is required when a single house, person, paper, or effect is searched.
The rationale for the ex ante review requirement in this situation is the
same as it is for individual searches and seizures. Justice Robert H. Jack-
son famously defended warrants as a means of forcing “inferences [to]
be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged
by the ofﬁcer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out
crime.”29 That rationale doesn’t change simply because the government is
no longer engaged in ordinary law enforcement.
At the same time, the exigency principle does not pose the obstruction
to law enforcement objectives that the probable-cause-forever and indi-
vidualized suspicion requirements do. Ex ante review would be required
only when there is time to obtain it. Furthermore, when the justiﬁcation re-
quirement is less than probable cause, as is often true with group searches,
judges might not need to be involved in the review process. For instance,
as chapter 5 suggested, camera installation could be approved by a judge,
but it could also be sanctioned by any high-level, politically accountable
ofﬁcial who is divorced from front-line law enforcement.
Finally, the Fourth Amendment’s reasonableness command dictates
rules with respect to execution of group searches and use of their results,
two matters legislatures and courts have largely neglected. For instance,
with respect to public camera surveillance, citizens are entitled to notice
of the surveillance, protections against discriminatory monitoring, and cir-
cumscribed dissemination of anything recorded. Destruction of recordings
after a reasonable period of time and periodic reports about their efﬁcacy
in ﬁghting crime might also be required. Data mining should be treated
similarly; minimization techniques should be in place and regular audits

and periodic reports required. These procedural aspects of regulation are
particularly important in connection with group searches given the number
of innocent people they catch in their net.
III. The Obsession with Exclusion
Since 1961, when the Supreme Court decided Mapp v. Ohio,30 exclusion
has been the remedy of choice when the Fourth Amendment is violated.
The Mapp Court was convinced that other remedies were “worthless and
futile” and that, in any event, both the Fourth and Fifth Amendments
required suppression of illegally obtained evidence.31 The post-Warren
Court has completely eliminated the Fifth Amendment basis for the rule32
and pretty much done away with its Fourth Amendment foundation as
well, insisting that exclusion is merely a judicially created remedy de-
signed to deter police misconduct.33 Yet it remains the primary sanction for
Fourth Amendment violations. In the meantime, administrative and dam-
ages remedies have atrophied or been explicitly narrowed by a Supreme
Court hostile to lawsuits against law enforcement agents and their em-
ployers.34
Elsewhere I have discussed at length how the exclusionary rule under-
mines civil liberties, albeit unintentionally and indirectly (as is true with
the probable cause and individualized suspicion mantras).35 First, the rule
is ineffective as a deterrent, in either the speciﬁc or general sense, because
it seldom comes into play and is only an indirect punishment when it does
so. Police know that most questionable searches and seizures never result
in arrest or prosecution, and that many of those that do result in formal
processing don’t trigger a suppression hearing because of the prevalence of
plea bargaining. When a hearing does take place, miscreant ofﬁcers often
prevail because of perjury, the hindsight biasing effect of judicial knowl-
edge that criminal evidence was found, and judicial reluctance to exclude
evidence. Even when evidence is suppressed, the prosecutor is hurt much
more than the ofﬁcer, whose primary goal is obtaining “collars,” not con-
victions, and whose superiors are likely to be sympathetic to aggressive
policework so long as it does not result in egregious abuse.36 The latter
point also helps explain why the rule does not have much of a “systemic”
effect, either. Research strongly suggests that training programs (run by
the same superiors or supervisors like them) routinely slight constitutional
issues and that ofﬁcers are not well versed in Fourth Amendment law.37

It is the damage to that law, however, that is the exclusionary rule’s most
insidious effect. The exclusionary remedy, designed to suppress evidence
of crime, ensures that the only Fourth Amendment claims most judges
see are brought by guilty people seeking to elude conviction. Thus, most
decision makers responsible for interpreting the Fourth Amendment are
rarely confronted by a breach of privacy claim from an innocent individ-
ual. To the contrary, in the typical case they know that vindication of the
claim will diminish or end any possibility of punishing an obvious criminal.
That is hardly a prescription for a fair, open-minded assessment of Fourth
Amendment issues.
The best argument for retaining the rule despite its ﬂaws is that current
alternatives to it are worse. Police are not good at policing themselves,
criminal prosecution against misbehaving ofﬁcers will usually be overkill,
and suits for damages are seldom brought and seldom won because of
plaintiffs’ ignorance of their rights, the expense of civil litigation, the in-
choate nature of the injury (which deters lawyers as well as potential plain-
tiffs from bringing suit), the biases of juries, and, as with the suppression
remedy, the efﬁcacy of police perjury. Furthermore, even if a misbehaving
ofﬁcer is sued and loses, he or she is usually indemniﬁed or judgment proof
or both, minimizing the impact of the verdict on the ofﬁcer.38
A damages action need not be so toothless, however. I have proposed a
different damages regime consisting of several core components: (1) a liq-
uidated damages/penalty for all unconstitutional actions, preferably based
on the average ofﬁcer’s salary; (2) personal, unindemniﬁable liability, at
the liquidated damages sum, of ofﬁcers who knowingly or recklessly vi-
olate the Fourth Amendment; (3) entity liability, at the liquidated dam-
ages sum, for all other violations; (4) state-paid legal assistance for those
with Fourth Amendment claims; and (5) a judicial decision-maker.39 With
these components in place, innocent people as well as criminals will have
an incentive to bring Fourth Amendment claims; ofﬁcers who knowingly
or recklessly violate the Fourth Amendment will receive direct, unalloyed
punishment; and departments will have a ﬁnancial incentive to ensure that
their employees know the law. Just as important, judges will be more likely
to acknowledge the true base rate of unconstitutional actions, because
they will see in their courtrooms numerous people who were searched and
found to have no evidence of crime in their pockets, homes, or records.
Under these conditions, judges will be more likely to evaluate accurately
the overall societal impact of progovernment ﬁndings (as well as much
less likely to condone perjury). In short, in a damages regime of the type

described here, judges will be forced to internalize the purpose of the
Fourth Amendment—protecting the privacy and autonomy interests of
all citizens.
In addition, as chapter 5 pointed out, a damages regime is a much better
remedial ﬁt for certain types of Fourth Amendment violations. When the
violation is inappropriate installation of cameras, failure to give notice of
their presence, or incompetent and malicious dissemination of personal
information obtained through physical or transaction surveillance, com-
pensatory or injunctive relief is the only meaningful response; exclusion
either makes no sense or is disproportionately harsh. Most important,
exclusion provides no remedy for the innocent victims of police abuse
of camera surveillance, technological tracking, and record collection and
data mining.
I am not arguing for replacement of the exclusionary rule with a dam-
ages regime, although a persuasive argument to that effect can be made.
Rather, I am saying that the dominance of the exclusionary rule has been
one of many reasons regulation of physical and transaction surveillance
has been stymied. And I am saying that without a meaningful damages
regime, the Fourth Amendment law that we do have in this area is not
likely to make much of a practical difference.
Conclusion
As it has in every other part of life, technology has wrought dramatic
changes in government surveillance techniques. What was once unthink-
able or at least highly uneconomical is now possible with the ﬂick of a
mouse or the push of a button. Technology has reduced or eliminated the
practical and ﬁscal barriers that used to keep law enforcement ofﬁcials
from peering into our homes, watching us on the streets, and accessing
our personal records. So today we must depend on the law to keep those
barriers intact.
The Fourth Amendment must be the primary source of that law. Leg-
islation can ﬂesh out the details, and government agencies can elaborate
even further through administrative rule-making, but the basis of regu-
lation must be constitutional. Given the immense power technological
surveillance gives the government and the potent incentives to use it in
this post-9/11 era, only the fundamental law of the land can provide a
sufﬁcient bulwark against inquisitive agents of the government.

The cornerstone of this bulwark should be the expectation-of-privacy
concept. Katz’s interpretation of the Fourth Amendment has been de-
clared incoherent, overly susceptible to manipulation, and insufﬁciently
descriptive of the values underlying the amendment. But as this book
demonstrates, expectations of privacy and autonomy can be meaningfully
gauged and thus need not be the product of judicial whimsy. The book
also makes clear that for physical and transaction surveillance, at least, no
other Fourth Amendment model provides a useful basis for regulation.
What is in need of repair is not the deﬁnition of the Fourth Amend-
ment’s threshold but the Supreme Court’s implementation of Katz and
its characterization of the types of justiﬁcations and remedies the Fourth
Amendment demands. The Court’s assumption-of-risk analysis is tauto-
logical, its insistence on an individualized probable cause standard for
ordinary searches misguided, and its adherence to the exclusionary rule
as the principal Fourth Amendment remedy short-sighted. None of these
precepts is required by the Fourth Amendment, and all should be aban-
doned or supplemented where appropriate. At the least, they should not
control regulation of physical and transaction surveillance. Instead, the
proportionality and exigency principles should govern and a realistic dam-
ages regime should be instituted.
These are not ivory tower prescriptions. Chief Justice Warren Burger
himself proposed a legislative damages scheme similar to the one outlined
here.40 Despite its rejection in cases like Grifﬁn, the exigency principle
embraces a commonsense notion routinely espoused in a number of other
Court opinions.41 And as chapter 2 explained, the proportionality princi-
ple derives directly from Terry v. Ohio. Nor have the Court’s subsequent
decisions, despite their antiregulatory bent, foreclosed implementation of
the latter principle in surveillance cases. Kyllo’s general public use and
naked eye exceptions are dictum. Knotts signaled that prolonged public
surveillance could be a search. The pen register in Smith was used only
to ascertain whether Smith contacted one speciﬁc number, so the Court
has yet to deal with a case involving the constitutionality of suspicionless
target-driven aggregation.42 And the recent decisions in Ferguson and Ran-
dolph, discussed in chapter 7, hint that the Court no longer endorses the
broad language in Miller exempting from Fourth Amendment protection
all information shared with a third party; if Miller were construed narrowly
to cover only the most impersonal records, it would not be a major obstacle
to the approach advocated here. In short, even if it remains good prece-
dent, the Court’s case law governing surveillance would not prevent the

continued development of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in a manner
consistent with the proportionality principle.
If that were to happen, physical and transaction surveillance would
no longer be constitutionally invisible. At the same time, both types of
investigative techniques would be available to the government whenever
the government really needed them. It is possible to achieve security in our
houses, persons, papers, and effects from both overweening government
ofﬁcials and those who wish to do us harm.

lance. In 2005–2006, however, the Bush Administration asserted that FISA did not
apply in certain surveillance situations, after controversy erupted over the National
Security Agency’s apparently extensive warrantless communications surveillance
of domestic and foreign individuals allegedly connected with terrorist organiza-
tions. See James Risen & Eric Lichtblau, Spying Program Snared US Calls, New
York Times, Dec. 21, 2005, at A1. As of this writing, litigation and debate about
the constitutionality of the NSA’s program is ongoing. See, e.g., ACLU v. NSA,

Cause: Denying the Devil Beneﬁt of Law, 19 Hastings Constitutional Law Quar-

warrant for searches designed to produce criminal evidence, it is hard to imagine
what further societal need would be so signiﬁcant that its presence should reduce
the standard of suspicion and judicial review.”).
31. The majority opinion in Terry stated that “there is some suggestion in the
use of such terms as ‘stop’ and ‘frisk’ that such police conduct is outside the purview
of the Fourth Amendment because neither action rises to the level of a ‘search’ or
‘seizure’ within the meaning of the Constitution.” See 392 U.S. at 16. In support,
the Court cited, among other material, the Ohio Court of Appeals decision in
Terry, which the Ohio Supreme Court afﬁrmed on the ground that no substantial
constitutional question was involved. See State v. Terry, 214 N.E.2d 114, 120 (Ohio

36. See generally John E. Nowak & Ronald D. Rotunda, Constitutional Law 601
(5th ed. 1995).
37. See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 340–41 (1976) (ﬁnding there is no
need for the evidentiary hearing required by Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970),
when the state terminates disability beneﬁts rather than welfare beneﬁts, since the
former are not based on need and an erroneous determination will not work as
much hardship).
38. See Dan B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts 1069 (2000). I suppose the best coun-
terexample is that we apply the same reasonable doubt standard of proof at any
criminal trial, whether it is adjudicating capital murder charges or a misdemeanor.
See In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970) (applying the reasonable doubt standard
to a juvenile delinquency proceeding). In practice, however, the procedures in the
former instance (ranging from jury and counsel rights to the nature of the sentenc-
ing proceeding) are much more protective. See Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S.
25 (1972) (holding that there is no right to counsel if defendant does not face jail
term); Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66 (1970) (declaring there is no right to jury
trial for petty crimes).
39.SeeWinstonv.Lee,470U.S.753,766(1985)(requiringthatbeforeconducting
surgery on a defendant for the purpose of obtaining evidence, the state must show
that the procedure does not unduly threaten the defendant’s health or safety, or his
or her dignitary interest, and that it is necessary to effect the government’s interest);
Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 59–60 (1967) (requiring for electronic surveillance
a warrant plus a showing of “exigent circumstances,” by which the Court appeared
to mean a particular need for the surveillance).
40. See Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 437 (1991) (remanding to Florida
Supreme Court for ultimate disposition on seizure issue); California v. Hodari D.,

621, 629 (1991) (questioning at the workplace); United States v. Mendenhall, 446
U.S. 544, 555 (1980) (plurality opinion holding no seizure on these facts).

subject to a Terry stop “is not obliged to respond” to questions).

Amendment on the Streets, 75 Cornell Law Review 1258, 1306 (1990) (stating that
“very few persons will have the moxie to assert their Fourth Amendment rights in
the face of police authority”).
44. The Court came closest to saying as much in United States v. Dionisio, 410
U.S. 1, 9–13 (1973), in which it held that grand jury subpoenas are not seizures
because the “minimal intrusion” associated with such a subpoena is justiﬁed by the
investigative tradition of the grand jury.

pectations of privacy in their ofﬁces, desks, and ﬁle cabinets . . . may be reduced
by virtue of actual ofﬁce practices and procedures, or by legitimate regulation.”).
Although in New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 337–38 (1985), the Court insisted
that a search of a child’s purse, “no less than a similar search carried out on an adult,
is undoubtedly a severe violation of subjective expectations of privacy,” it noted
that privacy expectations might change if the search focused on a locker, desk, or
other school property. Id. at 337 n.5. Further, its subsequent decision in Vernonia
suggests that even its stance with respect to purses might have shifted somewhat.

use of an undercover agent posing as a chauffeur (R = 31; M = 67.56) or secretary
(R = 34; M = 69.98) was viewed as more intrusive. See Slobogin & Schumacher,
Reasonable Expectations of Privacy and Autonomy, 738–39 tbl. 1.
57. Flying four hundred yards above the backyard in a helicopter was ranked
tenth (M = 40.32) and going through garbage was ranked thirteenth (M = 44.95),
compared to a pat down (R = 19; M = 54.76). See id.

62. For instance, in Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 665, the Court justiﬁed random drug
testing of student athletes in part because the testing “was undertaken in further-
ance of the government’s responsibilities, under a public school system, as guardian
and tutor of children entrusted to its care.” In T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 337 n.5, the Court
deferred deciding whether the reduced protection it endorsed for schoolchildren
would apply if the search had been carried out by police looking for evidence of
crime rather than schoolteachers investigating disciplinary infractions. Cf. Camara,
387 U.S. at 537 (discussing “public acceptance” of residential health and safety
inspections).
63. See Slobogin & Schumacher, Reasonable Expectations of Privacy and Au-
tonomy, 768–69 (discussing empirical support for an “implied consent” theory when
the government’s object is to prevent imminent harm (as in airport frisks) or to
facilitate and aid (as in ﬁre, safety, and health inspections)).

65. Compare the following ﬁndings to a pat down (R = 19; M = 54.76): using
a secretary as an undercover agent (R = 34; M = 68.98), accompanying subject of
drug test to a urinal at work and listening for sounds of urination (R = 39; M =
72.49), and searching a high school student’s purse (R = 41; M = 75.14). See id. at

omy, 759–60 (“[T]his study provides clear support for the proposition that searches
and seizures tend to be viewed as more intrusive when . . . their objective is not
clear rather than speciﬁed.”).
71. See, e.g., Rhode Island v. Innis, 441 U.S. 261 (1980) (“since the police surely
cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions,
the deﬁnition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part
of police ofﬁcers that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an
incriminating response.”).

78. The special needs rubric ﬁrst surfaced in Justice Blackmun’s concurring
opinion in T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 351 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (permitting searches
of students’ possessions in public schools on reasonable suspicion that a disciplinary
infraction has occurred). But it has since become the label applied to a host of situa-
tions in which “ordinary law enforcement” is not involved. See, e.g., O’Connor, 480
U.S. at 724 (reasonable suspicion sufﬁcient to authorize investigation of workplace
infractions); Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 620 (1989)

courts in cases such as People v. de Bour, 352 N.E.2d 562, 571–72 (N.Y. 1976) (re-
quiring “some objective credible reason” for the “minimal intrusion of approaching
[an individual] to request information”), and the standard adopted by the ABA to
govern technologically assisted physical surveillance of public places. See American
Bar Association, Standards for Criminal Justice, Electronic Surveillance, Section B:
Technologically-Assisted Physical Surveillance, 2–9.2(d) cmt. (1999).

Fourth Amendment, a search ordinarily must be based on individualized suspicion
of wrongdoing”).
84. 392 U.S. at 27.
85. The U.S. Supreme Court has avoided deciding whether the use of proﬁles
is permissible. See, e.g., United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1 (1989); Florida v.
Rodriguez, 469 U.S. 1 (1984). Most lower courts hold that proﬁles either cannot
establish reasonable suspicion or can do so only when supplemented with other
facts. See Morgan Cloud, Search and Seizure by the Numbers: The Drug Courier
Proﬁle and Judicial Review of Investigative Formulas, 65 Boston University Law
Review 843, 851 nn.37, 38 (1985).
86. See Cloud, Search and Seizure by the Numbers, 853; see also United States v.
Berry, 670 F.2d 583, 600 (5th Cir. 1982) (“A proﬁle does not focus on the particular
circumstances at issue.”). Critics have also pointed out that many proﬁles appear
to be ad hoc in nature and not really worthy of the name. See Sokolow, 490 U.S.
at 13–14 (Marshall, J., dissenting). This criticism of proﬁles is well taken, but it is
aimed at the implementation of proﬁles rather than their underlying premise.
87. I take this example from John Monahan & Larry Walker, Social Science in
Law: Cases and Materials 226–27 (1985).
88. However, search-by-proﬁle might need to be circumscribed when the con-
templated search is particularly invasive yet is meant to obtain only evidence of
petty crime. Justice Jackson called it “a shocking proposition that private homes,
even quarters in a tenement, may be indiscriminately invaded at the discretion
of any suspicious police ofﬁcer engaged in following up offenses that involve no
violence or threats of it.” McDonald v. United States, 355 U.S. 451, 458 (1948) (Jack-
son, J., concurring). See also Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740 (1984) (prohibiting
warrantless searches of homes for evidence of minor crime).

testing of students); Camara, 387 U.S. 523 (health and safety inspections of resi-
dences); New York v. Burger, 482 U.S. 691 (1987) (junkyards); Biswell, 406 U.S. 311

justify suspicionless testing).

(use of binoculars to look into a home). The Supreme Court has made statements
consistent with these holdings, albeit in cases involving targets outside the home.
See Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 740 (1983) (stating that “the use of artiﬁcial means
to illuminate a darkened area simply does not constitute a search” in the context
of a car search); On Lee v. United States, 343 U.S. 747, 754 (1952) (stating that “the
use of bifocals, ﬁeld glasses or the telescope to magnify the object of a witness’
vision is not a forbidden search or seizure, even if they focus without his knowledge
or consent upon what one supposes to be private indiscretions” in the context of
shining a searchlight on a boat). But see United States v. Taborda, 635 F.2d 131,
139 (2d Cir. 1980) (use of binoculars to look in a home deemed a search); United
States v. Kim, 415 F. Supp. 1252, 1257–58 (D. Haw. 1976) (same); People v. Arno,
153 Cal. Rptr. 624, 626 (Ct. App. 1979) (same).
23. See, e.g., People v. Oynes, 920 P.2d 880, 883 (Colo. Ct. App. 1996) (“Absent
evidence in the record indicating that the deputy’s binoculars were extraordinarily
powerful, we conclude that the observation [of a house] was not a ‘search’ for
constitutional purposes.”); Bernstiel v. State, 416 So. 2d 827, 828 (Fla. Dist. Ct.
App. 1982) (stating that the use of binoculars to look in a greenhouse is not a search
because “the emphasis appears to be on the danger imposed by more sophisticated
devices such as telescopes”); State v. Stachler, 570 P.2d 1323, 1328 (Haw. 1977)
(stating that the use of binoculars to look in a backyard is not a search but “if
the lower court had found . . . that highly sophisticated viewing devices had been
employed, we might well decide differently”).

relevant to “assessing in a particular case whether [an] expectation [of privacy in
the home] was in fact justiﬁed.” 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure, 473–74. The other

“the question before us must be not whether the police were where they had a right
to be, but whether public observation of Riley’s curtilage was so commonplace that
Riley’s expectation of privacy in his backyard could not be considered reasonable.”
Id. at 460, 465 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Justice Blackmun, who wrote a separate dis-
sent, similarly stated that “answering [the search] question depends upon whether
Riley has a ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ that no such surveillance would
occur, and does not depend upon the fact that the helicopter was ﬂying at a lawful
altitude under FAA regulations.” Id. at 467, 468 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).

place . . . in a physically nonintrusive manner”); Riley, 488 U.S. at 452 (“Neither is
there any intimation here that the helicopter interfered with respondent’s normal
use of the greenhouse or of other parts of the curtilage.”); Dow Chemical, 476
U.S. at 237 (“Any actual physical entry by EPA into any enclosed area would raise
signiﬁcantly different questions”).

use of the home or curtilage were observed”); Dow Chemical, 476 U.S. at 238
(noting that “the photographs here are not so revealing of intimate details as to
raise constitutional concerns”).
41. 476 U.S. at 239 (“An electronic device to penetrate walls or windows so as
to hear and record conﬁdential discussions of chemical formulae or other trade
secrets would raise very different and far more serious questions”). The Court also
distinguished the photography in Dow Chemical from satellite photography. Id. at

etrate” the walls and that “what was involved in this case was nothing more than
drawing inferences from off-the-wall surveillance, rather than any ‘through-the-
wall’ surveillance”).

55. A caveat to this conclusion is that Kyllo rejected the four factors discussed
above only in connection with home searches that do not use generally available
technology. Thus, when police looking into a home rely on technology in general
public use, the Court might still call the action a Fourth Amendment search if what
is viewed is “intimate,” the technology replicates more than could be seen through
unenhanced viewing, or one of the other factors is implicated.
56. Today, thermal imaging devices are used fairly routinely by a large number
of groups, including ﬁreﬁghters, doctors, and those engaged in maritime navigation,

60. Sometimes enhancement devices might be used not because they avoid de-
tection but because they cost less than naked eye observation (e.g., naked eye
observation that would have required an elaborate deception, such as ofﬁcers pos-
ing as telephone line repairpeople). If so, the Catch-22 is avoided, but the second
problem with the naked eye exception, discussed further in the text, is not—how is
a court to assess whether this more costly operation would have occurred and what
it would have allowed the police to see? Enhancement devices might also be used
to “conﬁrm” naked eye observation. See, e.g., State v. Holbron, 648 P.2d 194, 197
(Haw. 1982) (ﬁnding no search where binoculars are used only to conﬁrm unaided
observations). In this type of case, however, the enhanced observation sees more
detail than the naked eye; otherwise, “conﬁrmation” wouldn’t be necessary. See
Robert C. Power, Technology and the Fourth Amendment: A Proposed Formu-
lation for Visual Searches, 80 Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology 1, 49–50
(1989) (objecting that in cases like Holbron “objects that ofﬁcials can see but not
fully identify without enhancement are treated as if they were in full public view”).
61. See 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure, 572 (observing that “the prevailing rule” is
that using the senses to investigate the interior of a residence from a lawful vantage
point is not a search).
62. Compare, e.g., State v. Taylor, 401 N.E.2d 459, 462 (Ohio Ct. App. 1978)
(looking into an apartment from the “semi-public walkway” leading to the building
is not a search), and Borum v. United States, 318 A.2d 590, 592 (D.C. 1974) (looking
through a crack or hole in an apartment door is not a search) with State v. Carter,
569 N.W.2d 169, 178 (Minn. 1997) (looking into an apartment window from the
common area just outside the apartment window where bushes had to be walked
around is a search). Compare State v. Morrow, 291 N.W.2d 298, 299 (Wis. Ct. App.
1980) (looking under a door is a search), with Moody v. State, 295 So. 2d 272, 273–74
(Ala. Crim. App. 1974) (looking through partially open blinds is not a search), and
State v. Jordan, 631 P.2d 989, 990, 992 (Wash. Ct. App. 1981) (looking through a
space between drape and window frame is a search). Compare Commonwealth v.
Hernley, 263 A.2d 904, 905–6 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1970) (peering into a window using a
four-foot ladder is not a search), with State v. Kender, 588 P.2d 447, 449, 451 (Haw.
1978) (climbing three-quarters of the way up a fence and bracing oneself on a fellow
ofﬁcer’s shoulder to see into a backyard is a search). The last two cases involved
use of enhancement devices.

(Or. 1941) (describing imposition of a ﬁne for “looking in the windows of another’s

Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 555 S.W.2d 219, 221 (Tex. Civ. App. 1977) (“An intrusion
upon a plaintiff’s seclusion or solitude amounting to an invasion of privacy includes
eavesdropping upon private conversations by wiretapping, microphones or spying
into windows of a home.”); Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts 855 (W. Page
Keeton ed., 5th ed. 1984) (citing cases holding that the tort of intrusion “is to be
applied to peering into the windows of a home”). The Restatement states that “one
who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion
of another or his private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for
invasion of his privacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable
person.” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652B (1977).
89. Several also limit conviction to those who have a “lewd” intent or some other
sexual motivation. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. Ann. § 810.14(1) (requiring “lewd, lascivious,

95. See, e.g., Lorenzana v. Superior Court, 511 P.2d 33, 35 (Cal. 1973) (en banc)
(“A sidewalk, pathway, common entrance or similar passageway offers an implied
permission to the public to enter which necessarily negates any reasonable ex-

96. See Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 103–4 (1998) (Breyer, J., concurring)
(arguing that there was no Fourth Amendment violation when “the apartment in
question was a garden apartment that was partly below ground level; . . . families
frequently used the grassy area just outside the apartment’s window for walking
or for playing; . . . members of the public also used the area just outside the apart-
ment’s window to store bicycles; . . . [and the ofﬁcer] walked to a position about 1
to 1½ feet in front of the window [and] stood there for about 15 minutes looking
down through a set of venetian blinds”).
97. Compare Cal. Penal Code § 647(i) (prohibiting “peeking in the door or
window of any inhabited building or structure while loitering, prowling, or wan-
dering upon the private property of another”) with § 647(k) (prohibiting “looking

ity, including, but not limited to, a periscope, telescope, binoculars, camera, motion
picture camera, or camcorder, the interior of a bathroom, changing room . . . or

104. Id. at 1368 (Wright, J., dissenting) (quoting James v. United States, 418 F.2d
1150, 1151 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1969)).
105. 468 U.S. 705 (1984).
106. See also United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 723 (Blackmun, J., concurring
in the judgment) (“[A] dog sniff may be a search, but a minimally intrusive one that
could be justiﬁed in this situation under Terry upon mere reasonable suspicion.”).
107. 449 F.2d at 1357–60 (discussing a “closer look at a challenging situation”
and “plain view” as alternative justiﬁcations, with the former assuming a search
occurred, albeit perhaps in the absence of probable cause).
108. See State v. Christensen, 953 P.2d 583, 588 (Idaho 1998) (holding that entry
onto property marked with a No Trespassing sign was a search, but could be permis-
sible without a warrant if justiﬁed by something more serious than inquiries about
nearby residents); State v. Torres, 645 A.2d 529, 534–35 (Conn. 1994) (assuming a
dog sniff of a car was a search, but lawful because it was on “reasonable and articu-
lable suspicion”); State v. Cloutier, 544 A.2d 1277, 1280 (Me. 1988) (concluding that
entry onto private property was permissible based on recent burglary reports in the
area and the fact that the basement was the only illuminated room in the house,
even though these facts did not constitute either probable cause or reasonable sus-
picion; to enter property “a police ofﬁcer must be on some police business,” which
may be action based on a suspicion that turns out to be without substantial basis,
provided the suspicion is held in good faith rather than as a pretext for an arbitrary
search”); United States v. Bassford, 601 F. Supp. 1324, 1331 (D. Me. 1985) (“The
brief surveillance involved in the present case . . . was undertaken in response to
the receipt of speciﬁc information concerning the cultivation of marijuana on the
Bassford property.”).
109. It is worth noting that the Kyllo majority never ﬁrmly adopted the general
public use doctrine. In a footnote, it stated that general public use “may” be a
factor in the search analysis, and it intimated that it might “reexamine” this factor
in the future. 533 U.S. at 39 n.6. The naked eye doctrine was also unnecessary to the
Court’s decision, as the thermal imager obviously detected more than the naked
eye could see from a public vantage point.
110. Id. at 30 (noting that the police also relied on tips from informants and on
utility bills).

3577 (explaining that after “discussions with the Department of Justice,” it was
decided not to require exclusion when the rules governing interception of electronic
communications were violated).
129. One possible obstacle to such a statute is the Supreme Court’s recent will-
ingness to strike down laws that are not clearly based on congressional powers
authorized by the Constitution. See, e.g., United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995)
(holding that the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which makes it a federal offense for
any individual to knowingly possess a ﬁrearm in a place that the individual believes
or has reasonable cause to believe is a school zone, exceeded Congress’s Commerce
Clause authority). While a statute regulating technology that is sold across state
lines meets this test, a statute that regulates naked eye viewing may not.

an accomplice of Knotts purchased. The accomplice placed the container in his car,
which police followed. The container was soon transferred to the car of another
accomplice, which police also followed. But the driver used evasive maneuvers,
and the police had to resort to the beeper signal to discover the whereabouts of the
container, which was located in a cabin in which Knotts and others had constructed
a drug laboratory. Id. at 278–79.

results of independent and competently conducted evaluations of CCTV systems

International Association of Chiefs of Police 39 (Apr. 17, 2002) (on ﬁle with author)
[hereafter SIA and IACP Meeting] (“One of the problems we see in CCTV is that
if it’s being operator maintained or monitored, after about twenty minutes the
eyes start to glaze and it’s difﬁcult to keep monitoring the monitor.”). According
to Norris and Armstrong, “It is not possible for one or even two operatives to
continuously monitor the output of a twenty-camera system and, of course, as soon
as they selectively focus on one incident, other screens are going unmonitored.
This is exacerbated by the inherent boredom of watching dozens of screens and the
inattentiveness that results. But even the most attentive of operators are swamped
by the volume of information. For instance . . . a medium-sized 24-hour city centre
system with twenty cameras generates a quite staggering 43 million ‘pictures’ per
day.” Norris & Armstrong, The Maximum Surveillance Society, 211.

52. See Taylor, Closed Circuit Television, ¶ 32 (noting that soon after cameras
were introduced in Bingley, Yorkshire, the number of ofﬁcers based in town was
reduced from twenty-four to three).
53. Norris & Armstrong, The Maximum Surveillance Society, 166 (concluding
that the reason many suspects reported by a ﬁeld agent to the camera operator were
never located by the operator was that “location is often imprecise and descriptions
are too vague to signiﬁcantly differentiate a suspect from the crowd”).

policing, which traditionally enjoyed low visibility from managerial scrutiny is now
potentially subject to a far more intrusive supervisory gaze”).

months, apparently because the system failed to identify correctly a single face in

the authors concluded meant that CCTV “had no obvious inﬂuence on levels of

84. Davies’s comments about government attitudes in the United Kingdom are
instructive:
The government has placed video surveillance at the center of its law-and-order
policy. . . . CCTV is quickly becoming an integral part of crime-control policy, social
control theory, and “community consciousness.” It is widely viewed as a primary
solution for urban dysfunction. It is no exaggeration to conclude that the technology
has had more of an impact on the evolution of law enforcement policy than just about
any other technology initiative in the past two decades.

Privacy Commissioner for Canada attempted to limit the use of public cameras
set up by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia on the ground

120. These latter kinds of activities are apparently routinely spied upon by cam-
era operators. See DeGregory, Click. BEEP! Face Captured, 1D (quoting camera
operator as saying, “I’ve seen it all. Some things are really funny, like the way people
dance when they think no one’s looking. Others, you wouldn’t want to watch.”);
Norris & Armstrong, The Maximum Surveillance Society, 129 (“10 percent of all
targeted surveillances on women, and 15 percent of operator-initiated surveillance
were for apparently voyeuristic reasons, outnumbering protective surveillance by
ﬁve to one.”), 130 (“The ‘appreciation’ of such public displays [of sex in cars] was a
regular feature of the night shift in one of our suites and not just conﬁned to those
with access to the monitors. Many such encounters could be found on the ‘shaggers
alley greatest hits tape’ which was compiled and replayed for the beneﬁt of those
who missed the ‘entertainment.’ ”).

129. The best research in this regard comes from Carl Botan. In one study, based
on the responses of 465 workers in the communications industry, he found that
“employees who are surveilled . . . experience several panoptic effects, including
a reduced sense of privacy, increased uncertainty [as to job security], and reduced
communication.” Carl Botan, Communication Work and Electronic Surveillance:
A Model for Predicting Panoptic Effects, 63 Communications Monographs 293,
308–9 (1996). A second study based on the same survey results, conducted with
Mihaela Vorvoreanu, noted other deleterious effects:
The overwhelming meta-message that surveillance seems to send to employees is
that they are distrusted. . . . In a closely related interpretation, many employees
see surveillance as setting someone, possibly themselves, up for dismissal or dis-
cipline. . . . Many subjects also perceive surveillance as implying that management
feels they deserve to be treated as children, . . . and heavily surveilled employees
reported reduced motivation to do more quantity of work . . . and reduced moti-
vation to do higher quality work . . . . Finally, heavily surveilled subjects reported
reduced loyalty to the organization, increased stress at work, and reduced enthu-
siasm about even going to work, all of which are supported by qualitative com-
ments. . . .

130. As reported in section 3 of this chapter, surveys asking what people think of
CCTV routinely produce overwhelmingly positive results. But no survey, outside
of the one that I conduced for this chapter, has focused on CCTV’s panoptic effects
(and even the study reported here does so only indirectly).

Court unanimously struck down a government regulation requiring individuals to
make a special written request to the post ofﬁce for delivery of mail containing
communist literature:
[U]nder such a regulation, any addressee is likely to feel some inhibition in send-
ing for literature which federal ofﬁcials have condemned as “communist political
propaganda.” The regime of this Act is at war with the “uninhibited, robust, and
wide-open” debate and discussion that are contemplated by the First Amendment.
Id. at 307; see also Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58 (1963) (ﬁnding the
First Amendment violated when the city government sent letters that identiﬁed
certain books as “objectionable,” stated it would turn its list of distributors of those
books over to police, and sometimes sent police ofﬁcers to see whether distributors
took any action with respect to the books). In both Lamont and Bantam Books
the First Amendment violation was the government’s suggestion that the speech
activity was inappropriate.

the Religious Society of Friends v. Tate, 519 F.2d 1335, 1337–38 (3d Cir. 1975) (no

public places such as airports. Ken Kaye, High Tech Security Gets Tests at Airports,

212. See Taylor, Closed Circuit Television, ¶ 16 (reporting polling results that
found between 69 percent and 95 percent in favor of the cameras). Note, however,
that the way survey questions about CCTV have been framed apparently distorts
the results obtained. See Jason Ditton, Public Support for Town Centre CCTV
Schemes: Myth or Reality? in Surveillance, Closed Circuit Television, and Social
Control, 227 (ﬁnding that positive framing of questions increased CCTV’s accep-
tance by 20 percent, and that if that proportion were subtracted from the 69 percent
positive response in previous professional surveys, “we have a minority—albeit a
very large minority—but only a minority ﬁnding open street city centre CCTV
acceptable.”).

ing to several of them (involving, e.g., searches of personal diaries and car trunks)
do not add appreciably to the discussion and are not reported here.
216. See, e.g., Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 438 (1991).
217. The conﬁdence intervals are larger for the camera surveillance scenarios
because, given the desire to test variations of those scenarios, there were fewer
surveys completed for each.

ment to place an armed force in constant watch over the populace was vehemently
rejected as a paradigm of abhorrent French despotism,” and noting that organized
police forces were resisted in colonial times). In correspondence with the author,
Davies, who has closely studied the Fourth Amendment’s history, emphasized the
last fact, noting that, other than “snooping” by British informers (which occasioned
hostility among the colonists), there was no one available to conduct surveillance:
“the constable had better things to do (trying to make a living) than stand around
looking for hints of crime.” E-mail from Thomas Davies, Professor of Law, Uni-
versity of Tennessee School of Law, to Christopher Slobogin, July 8, 2002, 2:16

and pointed out that “surveillers would have had more difﬁculty blending into the
smaller, closer social settings of that time.” Id.
225. See generally David Sklansky, The Fourth Amendment and the Common
Law, 100 Columbia Law Review 1739, 1739 (2000):
Anchoring the Fourth Amendment in common law will do little to make it more
principled or predictable, in part because common-law limits on searches and seizures
were thinner, vaguer, and far more varied than the Court seems to suppose. What
the common law has of value to offer Fourth Amendment law is what it has to offer
constitutional law more generally: not its rules but its method.

237. Note, however, one difference between a right to anonymity and the other
rights. Each of the other rights could be said to be inhibited by crime at least as much
as by cameras (consider in particular the right to movement and repose). Thus, one
could argue that those rights are infringed if government does not install CCTV,
at least in high crime areas. The right to anonymity is more clearly independent of
the fear of crime; it is always implicated by CCTV.

6. Given the intrusiveness ratings of the coal mine and factory inspection scenar-
ios reported in chapter 4, another source of precedent would be the closely regu-
lated industry cases. See Charles H. Whitebread & Christopher Slobogin, Criminal
Procedure: An Analysis of Cases and Concepts 295–300 (4th ed. 2000) (describing
the cases). These cases require the government to show a “substantial” interest in
the activity being regulated and also require limitations on when and how searches
can be carried out that amount to “a constitutionally adequate substitute for a
warrant.” Dewey v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 594, 602–3 (1981). Note, however, that these
decisions deal with speciﬁc industries, not the public at large, so roadblocks provide
a closer analog to CCTV.

27. Should the public be able to force the installation of cameras when they are
not warranted under the foregoing analysis? Tracey Meares and Dan Kahan argue
that when “the community has internalized the burden that a particular law im-
poses on individual freedom,” courts “should presume that the law does not violate
individual rights.” Tracey L. Meares & Dan M. Kahan, The Wages of Antiquated
Procedural Thinking: A Critique of Chicago v. Morales, 1998 University of Chicago
Legal Forum 197, 209. But the “community” is hard to gauge. Compare Remarks

Association of Chiefs of Police 21 (Apr. 17, 2002) (on ﬁle with author) [hereafter
SIA and IACP Meeting] (“Virtually every housing development in New York City

moved in nearby). And while chapter 4 argues that community views are crucial to
the privacy issue, it is clear that Fourth Amendment reasonableness is ultimately a
judicial matter. Nonetheless, if a well-informed community clearly favors cameras,
a (rebuttable) presumption in their favor may be a workable approach.

53. Later I suggest that regulatory rules be disseminated to the public as a
way of limiting panoptic effects. One objection to this rule is that once it is made
known to the citizenry, it will be manipulated by perpetrators who will simply wait
ﬁve minutes before engaging in any suspicious activity. However, the ﬁve-minute
period need not start when the subject enters the camera area (and in fact shouldn’t
start at all unless something suspicious occurs), which can be made clear in the
rule disseminated to the public. Such a rule could simply read this way: “Camera
operators will not focus on individuals unless they engage in activity indicative
of criminal intent or are in need of aid, and will not continue surveillance unless
criminal intent or harm is conﬁrmed.”
54. Norris and Armstrong found that somewhere around 12–15 percent of all
targeted surveillances lasted more than nine minutes (that percentage increased to
25 percent for blacks), and that close to 40 percent lasted between two and six min-
utes. Norris & Armstrong, The Maximum Surveillance Society, 150. Deployment

States that New York has emulated, for an assumption that the security provisions
of the statute will be administered improperly.”). The Court also noted that it
did not need to address the constitutionality of “the unwarranted disclosure of
accumulated private data whether intentional or unintentional or by a system that
did not contain comparable security provisions.” Id. at 605–6.

73. The Supreme Court has indicated that the failure to maintain accurate
records of a search is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment when the underly-
ing search is valid. Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433, 449 (1973). But it has yet to
address this issue when the validity of the search is questionable or indeterminable
because of police failure to provide adequate information. Furthermore, it has held
that the Fourth Amendment is violated when police intentionally hide or mischar-
acterize information relevant to a search. Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155–56

statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was
included by the afﬁant in the warrant afﬁdavit, and if the allegedly false statement
is necessary to the ﬁnding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that

75. See generally Christopher Slobogin, Criminal Procedure: Regulation of Po-
lice Investigation 561–63 (3d ed. 2003) (describing ineffectiveness of administrative
sanctions); Jerome Skolnick, Justice without Trial 224 (1975) (asserting that so long
as a search or seizure is “in conformity with administrative norms of police organi-
zation,” superiors will be sympathetic).
76. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 63 (1961).
77. See Norris & Armstrong, The Maximum Surveillance Society, 168.
78. See Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. 1 (1995) (holding that exclusion is not required
where arresting ofﬁcer relies on computer records maintained by civilian court
personnel).
79. Cf. United States v. Ceccolini, 435 U.S. 268, 278 (1978) (holding that since wit-
nesses will often come forward of their own accord, and “since the cost of excluding
live-witness testimony often will be greater [than excluding tangible evidence], a
closer,moredirectlinkbetweentheillegalityandthatkindoftestimonyisrequired”
before witness testimony will be excluded).
80. See Whitebread & Slobogin, Criminal Procedure, 61–62 (describing obsta-
cles to criminal prosecutions for Fourth Amendment violations).
81. Suits under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the main avenue for constitutional damage
actions, would not be worth the effort for many people who are illegally surveilled
because actual injury in such cases would be negligible and “symbolic” injury is not
compensable. Memphis Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299 (1986). Further, unless
the violation is somehow ratiﬁed by a superior, the government would usually have
a “policy or custom” defense. Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469 (1986).
82. Hague v. C.I.O., 307 U.S. 496 (1939) (holding that a state ofﬁcial may be
enjoined under 42 U.S.C. § 1983). Because the issue concerns whether a planned
CCTV system may be installed, it is justiciable; the Court’s rigid barriers to injunc-
tive relief against discretionary decisions, see, e.g., Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S.
95 (1983), would be avoided.
83. A constitutional damages suit against the government might be stalled by
a policy and custom defense, see Pembaur, and the party that receives the tape
may be immune. See Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 (2001). But the individuals
who release the tape are still liable. Of course, a state law tort action, based on
public disclosure of private facts, may also be available. See Restatement (Second)
of Torts § 652C (1977); Restatement (Third) of the Law of Unfair Competition § 46
(1993) (nonconsensual appropriation of name of likeness for commercial purposes
is actionable).

86. 18 U.S.C. § 2529(3) (requiring periodic reports of number of surveillance
warrants and warrant extensions, types of crimes investigated with surveillance,
number of people overheard, arrests generated by surveillance, and so on).
87. See McAdams, Tying Privacy in Knotts, 318–19:
The amendment guarantees the people a right to be “secure,” a word that means “free
from fear, care, or anxiety: easy in mind . . . having no doubt.” Manifestly concerned
with the repose of the people, the framers of the Fourth Amendment did not merely
create a right of individuals to be free from unreasonable searches or seizures, but a
societal right to be free from the fear such practices create.

the power of the court to require the accused to criminate himself by the production
of the paper as evidence against himself” and reversing a conviction in which the
defendant was required to produce a document at trial). However, a number of
nineteenth-century federal cases upheld subpoenas for documents relating to taxes
and fees. See, e.g., United States v. Hutton, 26 F. Cas. 454 (S.D.N.Y. 1879); United
States v. Hughes, 26 F. Cas. 417 (C.C.N.Y. 1875) (No. 15417). See also United States

the law jealously protects private books and papers from unreasonable searches
and seizures . . . yet the principle is equally strongly held that parties litigant have
the right to have private writings which are competent for proof in their causes
produced in evidence,” and permitting such production upon “preliminary proof
of the necessity”).
19. Indeed, the Supreme Court asserted in 1886 that a congressional act passed

A very small minority of federal courts have purported to require a greater
evidentiary showing before issuing a subpoena, but, if that is so, the showing is
only minimally different. The case most frequently cited for this proposition is In
re Grand Jury Proceedings (Schoﬁeld), 486 F.2d 85 (3d Cir. 1973), which required
the government to make “some preliminary showing by afﬁdavit that each item
requested [is] at least relevant to an investigation being conducted by the grand jury
and properly within its jurisdiction and not sought primarily for another purpose.”
486 F.2d at 93.
38. 201 U.S. at 43.
39. Id. at 74.
40. See, e.g., Wheeler v. United States, 226 U.S. 478, 490 (1913) (“It was the
character of the books and papers as corporate records and documents which justi-
ﬁed the court in ordering their production.”); Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361,
377 (1911) (“Undoubtedly [the privilege against self-incrimination] also protected
him against the compulsory production of his private books and papers.”); Linn v.
United States, 251 F. 476, 480 (2d Cir. 1918) (“While a person is privileged from
producing his books in a prosecution against himself, a corporation is not privileged
from producing its papers and books, even though they incriminate the ofﬁcer who
produces them.”); Flagg v. United States, 233 F. 481, 484 (2d Cir. 1916) (holding
invalid a subpoena for personal books and papers); Hillman v. United States, 192
F. 264, 266 (9th Cir. 1911) (“It will be observed that in the plea there is no distinct
averment that any of the books or papers so taken upon the subpoena duces tecum
were the private books or papers of the plaintiff in error.”); United States v. Hart,
214 F. 655, 661 (N.D.N.Y. 1914) (“Hart could not have been compelled to produce
these [private] papers and documents by subpoena duces tecum without gaining
immunity for himself.”).
41. 327 U.S. at 208. See also United States v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., 321
U.S. 707, 726 (1944) (“The Fifth Amendment does not protect a corporation against
self-incrimination through compulsory production of its papers, although it does
protect an individual.”).
42. 338 U.S. at 652.
43. 381 U.S. 479, 484 (1965) (“The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination
Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not
force him to surrender to his detriment.”).
44. In the search warrant context, by contrast, the Court for a time relied on
a combination of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to prohibit seizure of private
papers, under the so-called mere evidence doctrine. Gouled v. United States, 255
U.S. 298, 309 (1921) (citing Boyd, 116 U.S. 616, in holding that search warrants
“may not be used as a means of gaining access to a man’s house or ofﬁce and
papers solely for the purpose of making search to secure evidence to be used against
him in a criminal or penal proceeding”). This doctrine is tangential to the subject
of this book, which focuses on subpoenas, and in any event has also since been

emasculated. See, e.g., Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547, 558 (1978) (“Once
it is established that probable cause exists to believe a federal crime has been
committed a warrant may issue for the search of any property which the magistrate
has probable cause to believe may be the place of concealment of evidence of the
crime.”); Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 301 (1967) (“Nothing in the language
of the Fourth Amendment supports the distinction between ‘mere evidence’ and
instrumentalities, fruits of crime, or contraband.”). It is also worth emphasizing that
the doctrine was based more on the Fifth Amendment than the Fourth. See Gouled,
255 U.S. at 306 (stating that whether private papers are seized from a person via a
warrant or a subpoena, “in either case he is the unwilling source of the evidence,
and the Fifth Amendment forbids that he shall be compelled to be a witness against
himself in a criminal case”).

ing schools to provide parental access to student records and permitting parents
to challenge the records if they are misleading, inaccurate, or violate the student’s

customer either generates the records (e.g., through checks) or receives a detailed
periodic statement describing the information possessed by the bank, the latter of
which can be corrected by the customer.

strong) is found in international laws and the laws of other countries. Consider,

Assembly Resolution 45/95. Under “Principle of the Purpose-Speciﬁcation,” the
Guidelines state:
The purpose which a ﬁle is to serve and its utilization in terms of that purpose should
be speciﬁed, legitimate and, when it is established, receive a certain amount of pub-
licity or be brought to the attention of the person concerned, in order to make it
possible subsequently to ensure that: . . . (b) None of the said personal data is used
or disclosed, except with the consent of the person concerned, for purposes incom-
patible with those speciﬁed.

(“The complaint alleged that on the basis of estimated net worth calculations the
agent strongly suspected fraud”). The IRS usually selects tax return audits based on
“mathematical formulas developed from intensive examination of returns selected
at random to identify those with a high probability of error.” Boris I. Bittker, Martin

bribery, racketeering, and controlled substance investigations is not available.
122. See 1 Beale et al., Grand Jury Law and Practice, 6-3 (noting that “ordinarily,
investigations of so-called ‘street crime’ such as murder, rape, robbery, and assault
can be conducted effectively without resort to the subpoena power”). Even in busi-
ness investigations, this is often the case. See, e.g., United States v. Goldﬁne, 538 F.2d
815, 818–19 (9th Cir. 1976) (noting that an agency carrying out an administrative
inspection had developed probable cause to believe that pharmacists were violating
the Comprehensive Drug Prevention and Control Act, based on reports of large
shipments of controlled substances to the pharmacy, tracing of certain shipments,
surveillance of the pharmacy, and the arrest of some of the pharmacy’s customers).
If, as I argue in chapter 7, the government need merely meet the relevance standard
in order to obtain truly public records and engage in most types of data mining (for
instance, to determine who traveled to the residence of a murder victim on the day
of the murder), there is even less reason to relax the standard applicable to more
intrusive transaction surveillance.

government need only submit a formal written request for the information (in other
words, “extrajudicial certiﬁcation” is sufﬁcient). 12 U.S.C. § 3408. Indeed, appar-
ently banks still occasionally hand over information upon request. See David F.

29. 18 U.S.C. § 2703(a), (b)(1)(B). Further, a subpoena is required only when the
information is sought from a “remote computing service” (e.g., a service available
to the general public, like AOL). If the information is stored with a private service
(e.g., one run by an employer), then ECPA does not apply at all and government
may obtain the stored information (content or identifying) upon request. See 18
U.S.C. § 2703(a) and (b). See also 18 U.S.C. § 2711(2) (deﬁning remote computing
service); U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining
Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations 89 (July 2002). But see Warshak,
2007 WL 1730094 at *13 (requiring a warrant for stored e-mail).

31. See Clifford S. Fishman & Anne T. McKenna, Wiretapping and Eavesdrop-
ping § 26:9 (2d ed. 1995) (in the view of Congress, when an e-mail message stays
on a server longer than 180 days, the service provider is less like a post ofﬁce and
more like a storage facility).
32. 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1)(E) (describing information that can be obtained);
18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(3) (“A governmental entity receiving records or information
under this subsection is not required to provide notice to a subscriber or cus-
tomer.”).
33. 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(d) (describing requirements for a court order to obtain
“records concerning electronic communication service or remote computing ser-
vice”). Note that most courts have held that companies that acquire clickstream
data about where a Internet user goes on the Internet do not violate ECPA be-
cause the Web sites visited by the user have authorized the companies to access
this information. See In re DoubleClick, Inc. Privacy Litig., 154 F. Supp. 2d 497,
526 (S.D.N.Y. 2001); Chance v. Ave. A, Inc., 165 F. Supp. 2d 1153, 1163 (W.D. Wash.
2001); In re Toys R Us, Inc., Privacy Litig., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16947, at *28
(N.D. Cal. Oct. 9, 2001). An argument could be made, analogous to the govern-
ment’s argument with respect to records obtained from commercial data brokers,
that government should be able to obtain this information simply by asking for it.
But ECPA probably requires a subpoena. See, e.g., United States v. Steiger, 318
F.3d 1039, 1050 (11th Cir. 2003).
34. Charles Tilford McCormick, McCormick on Evidence 541–42 (3d ed. 1984)
(“Materiality looks to the relation between the propositions for which the evi-
dence is offered and the issues in the case. . . . A fact that is ‘of consequence’ is
material. . . . It is enough if the item could reasonably show that a fact is slightly
more probable than it would appear without that evidence.”).
35. 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) (providing court may quash or modify order if the request
is “unusually voluminous in nature or compliance with such order otherwise would
cause an undue burden on such provider.”).
36. 50 U.S.C. § 1861.

Department of Justice at one time disputed these ﬁgures, stating that in 2005, 9,254
NSLs were issued that “related to U.S. persons.” See 79 Criminal Law Reporter
(BNA) 161 (May 10, 2006). However, a recent report by the Justice Department’s
inspector general suggested that the earlier report vastly underestimated the preva-
lence of NSLs. Johnston & Lipton, U.S. Report to Fault FBI on Subpoenas.
63. People who have worked at the Department of Justice (Paul Ohm, Orin
Kerr) state that in practice, a certiﬁcation order may be harder to obtain than a
subpoena. But I rank the certiﬁcation order lower in the hierarchy of protection
because the judge issuing the order plays such a minimal role; in contrast, when
deciding whether to issue a subpoena, the judge is permitted to ﬁnd a seizure invalid
on relevance grounds, although he or she may rarely do so.

139 A.L.R. Fed. 225 (2004).
83. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). The Supreme Court has deﬁned “similar ﬁles” broadly
to include “detailed Government records on an individual which can be identiﬁed
as applying to that individual,” U.S. Dep’t of State v. Washington Post Co., 456 U.S.
595, 602 (1982), although it has also made clear that such ﬁles cannot be withheld
simply because anonymity cannot be guaranteed, and that redaction of identifying
names may be sufﬁcient to safeguard privacy. Department of Air Force v. Rose, 425
U.S. 352, 381–82 (1976). See generally When Are Government Records “Similar

87. An alternative approach would be to permit any type of transaction surveil-
lance that is rated as less intrusive than a pat down on a relevance showing. That
approach would vastly simplify the analysis while still providing a modicum of
protection for quasi-private records.

90. I have called this latter type of data mining “match driven” to distinguish it
from data mining that starts with a target; with match-driven data mining, the goal
is not to ﬁnd out more about a suspect but rather to determine whether a particular
person is a known suspect. See Christopher Slobogin, Government Data Mining

98. How is the government to meet this burden? Sometimes the government’s
proﬁle may satisfy the requisite certainty level on its face, as in a fraud investigation
where the proﬁle singles out individuals who have bought items they are clearly
not authorized to buy. Other types of proﬁles might be tested through hypothetical
computer runs, something the government is apparently doing now. See Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, Report to Congress Regarding the Terrorism
Information Awareness Program 17 (describing use of “synthetic data” to test the
efﬁcacy of data-mining processes). As a last resort, an actual data-mining program
could be carried out on a small sample under secure conditions to determine its
efﬁcacy. But in some situations, none of these methods will be feasible. As indi-
cated in chapter 2, if the government can provide a convincing explanation as to
why relevant data cannot be obtained, while at the same time suggesting why the
relevant hit rate can be met, it might be allowed to proceed.

and often negative, experience with dragnet information-gathering, permits event-

110. Solove, Digital Dossiers, 1157 (“Focusing on ‘systems of records’ targets
the type of information ﬂow that raises concern. Because the problem of modern
government information-gathering is caused by the increasing dossiers maintained
in private sector record systems, the architecture targets those third parties that
store data in record systems.”).
111. Of course, the employees of the recordholder might want to reveal pri-
vate information. See, e.g., Susan Freiwald, Uncertain Privacy: Communication
Attributes after the Digital Telephony Act, 69 Southern California Law Review
949, 1013 (1996) (“As the president of the United States Telephone Association
put it in explaining that telephone companies are interested in acceding to law
enforcement requests for assistance, the companies want to be ‘good local citi-
zen[s].’ ”). But limiting that ability is not denying the employee’s “personhood,”
because the information is maintained by the institution, not the person.

to entire databases of records . . . will be used expansively to intrude into a wide
array of domestic matters.” Swire, The System of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance

list compiled by president-turned-dictator George W. Bush.” (Paul Chasman, Wald-
port); “Whether the next president is a Republican or Democrat, there is nothing
to prevent him from using this Executive Branch database for his own political
purposes. That is a real threat to America. This database needs to be immediately
and completely destroyed.” (Michael E. Stabeno, Beaverton) “This is an egregious
overreach into the conduct of private citizens’ lives.” (Peter Baker, Boring). Port-
land Oregonian, May 16, 2006, at B09, available at 2006 WLNR 8457654. It is also

impenetrable”).
122. Richard B. Schmitt, House OKs Expanded Wiretap Program, Los Angeles
Times, Sept. 29, 2006, pt. A, at 18. Although the White House subsequently agreed
to allow the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court to oversee its national security
eavesdropping program, it is still not clear “whether the administration will be
required to seek a warrant for each person it wants to monitor or whether the
FISA court has issued a broader set of orders covering a multitude of cases.” Dan

18, 2007, at A1. Congress has also expressed concern about the abuse of NSLs
but to date has not reined in the practice beyond its 2006 amendments to the
Patriot Act. See Dan Eggen & John Solomon, Lawmakers Demand Limits on

123. 532 U.S. 67, 94–95 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“Until today, we have
never held—or even suggested—that material which a person voluntarily entrusts
to someone else cannot be given by that person to the police, and used for whatever
evidence it may contain.”) (emphasis in original).
124. Id. at 78 (“The use of an adverse test result to disqualify one from eligibility
for a particular beneﬁt, such as a promotion or an opportunity to participate in an
extracurricular activity, involves a less serious intrusion on privacy than the unau-
thorized dissemination of such results to third parties. The reasonable expectation
of privacy enjoyed by the typical patient undergoing diagnostic tests in a hospital is
that the results of those tests will not be shared with nonmedical personnel without
her consent.”).

132. I am more sympathetic to Randolph’s rejection of the assumption-of-risk
rationale than its actual holding, however. I would have decided Randolph differ-
ently because, for reasons recounted earlier, I think the consenting co-occupant’s
autonomy is denigrated by automatically honoring the refusal. In cases of compet-
ing desires expressed by autonomous actors, the government ought to be able to
choose which decision to honor (which will normally be that of the consentor). In
the transaction surveillance context, however, there is no countervailing autonomy
interest on the part of the consenting recordholder.

to Ronald Reagan and well-known conservative commentator, who testiﬁed in sup-
port of Senate Resolution 398 censuring President Bush for, as Fein put it, “seeking
to cripple the Constitution’s checks and balances and political accountability by se-
cretly authorizing the National Security Agency to spy on American citizens in the
United States in contravention of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and
misleading the public about the secret surveillance program.” Testimony, Senate

11. Brennan and Marshall clearly called for a probable cause requirement in
Smith. 442 U.S. 735, 751 (1979). However, Stewart’s opinion in that case merely
stated that phone numbers fall “within the constitutional protection recognized in
Katz,” without indicating whether a warrant was required to obtain them. Id. at 747.
In Miller, Brennan simply spoke of requiring “appropriate legal process,” without
specifying what that might mean. 425 U.S. 435, 450 (1976). Only Marshall explicitly
stated he would require a warrant based on probable cause on Miller’s facts. 425

13. Id. Cloud also argues that this approach, taking its cue from Boyd, would
provide almost absolute protection for particularly private papers, communications
and the like, but of course a privacy-based Fourth Amendment can accomplish the
same goal.

15. See Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 302 (1967) (“[D]epending on the cir-

‘instrumentality’ in another.”).

Hidden Economic Agenda, 65 University of Chicago Law Review 35, 42–56 (1998)
(detailing the breadth of today’s forfeiture statutes).
17. This was the gist of Justice Black’s dissent in Katz, where he argued the words
“search” and “seizure” “connote the ideal of tangible things with size, form and
weight, things capable of being searched, seized, or both.” 389 U.S. at 365 (Black, J.,
dissenting).

28. One formulation of this idea was developed (but ultimately discarded) by
the ABA Task Force on Law Enforcement and Technology:
An action by a law enforcement ofﬁcer is “reasonably likely to achieve a legitimate
law enforcement objective” if there are articulable reasons for concluding that the
action will:
(i)
discover the commission of a particular offense or type of offense;
(ii)
further an ongoing investigation of a particular offense or type of offense;
(iii) deter or prevent a particular offense;
(iv) deter a signiﬁcant number of offenses in a given area; or
(v)
prevent one or more persons from suffering serious physical harm.
