Introduction
The retirement world is generally on a steady march away from traditional 
pension plans and toward individual retirement responsibility in 401(k)s, 
Individual Retirement   Accounts (IRAs), and the like. The fact of the matter is, 
however, that the average person, who is now responsible for their retirement 
security, often lacks the tools to manage their assets and future expectations 
as well as the professional managers of those pension plans are able to do.
A variety of studies have been published in recent years that indicate that 
traditional defined benefit pension plans on average have experienced annual 
returns that are 1% to 2% higher than defined contribution plans, like 401(k)s  
and IRAs.1 Although a 1.5% improvement in the rate of return may not sound 
like much, $100,000 invested at the rate of 6.0% for a working career of 
20 years would have grown by the time of retirement to $320,000; that 
same $100,000 invested at a rate of 7.5% would have grown by the time of 
retirement to $425,000.  As you can see, that average 1.5% underperformance 
of a 401(k) or IRA versus a defined benefit pension plan may sound small, but 
it can make a very meaningful difference.
While some members of the financial press and some political leaders like to 
blame pension plans for every budgetary and societal ill in the history of the 
world, maybe this return advantage indicates that they actually do some things 
right. Plenty of arguments have been made over the last several years about 
the high cost of pension plans to corporations and public agencies. However, 
that cost is at least partially offset by the superior returns of pension plans. In 
addition, you can’t argue about the cost of pension plans without considering 
the societal cost of replacing pension plans with individual responsibility.
This book is not intended, however, to engage in the ongoing political debate 
over the merits or failures of pension plans versus defined contributions 
plans (I merely will note that other studies have shown that pension plans are 
actually cheaper than defined contribution plans to reach the same benefit 
level ).2 I will leave that to the politicians, commentators, and political writers 
to work out among themselves. Instead, in this book, I will take it as a given

that the average person is more responsible for their own retirement security 
than ever before, and I will try to teach that average person about what we 
as individuals can learn from pension plans. What do the biggest retirement 
savers and investors in the country do to generate superior returns at lower 
costs? Do the better results that pension plans exhibit come from superior 
asset allocation? Better managers? Lower fees? Alternative asset classes? Risk 
reduction?
Yes. All of the above.
Pension plans employ all of these tools to generate better returns than 
the average individual investor. However, as I will show, very few of these 
advantages are exclusive to pension plans. In fact, most of the strategies and 
approaches to investing that drive these superior results can be copied by 
individuals who understand their strengths and weaknesses, who understand 
where to take smart risks and avoid dumb ones, who have learned how to be 
disciplined when it comes to asset allocation and cash flow management, and 
who know how to reduce the greatest drain on assets: fees and expenses.
It is easy to make a small fortune in the investment world: Begin with a large 
fortune and start chasing the latest trends and “hot” advice.
If you are looking for investment advice that is guaranteed to make you rich 
overnight, put this book back on the shelf and look elsewhere. That’s right, 
just put the book down and walk away.  There are plenty of magazine articles,  
get-rich-quick seminars, and late night infomercials out there that will do a much 
better job of selling horrendously bad advice to you than I could ever do.
My goal with this book is just the opposite: to help you protect your wealth 
and grow it in a risk-controlled manner over time. The contents of this book 
will never make for great cocktail party chatter, as they won’t lead to stories 
of huge successes with individual stocks or bonds. They will, however, help to 
ensure that your investments are properly positioned for whatever befalls the 
market: bubbles and busts, growth and recession, war and peace, predictability 
and surprises.
After working with large institutional investors (endowments; foundations; 
and the pension plans of states, cities, counties, and large corporations) for 
almost two decades, I have discovered a great divide between the advice that 
professionals provide to multibillion-dollar clients and that which financial 
planners,3 stockbrokers, and television “experts” often provide to individuals. 
3In my experience, there are some genuinely great financial planners out there, as I discuss 
in the chapter on fees and expenses. The secret to finding a terrific one, and avoiding the 
ones that will eat up your wealth, is all a matter of incentives. If they are paid to sell you 
stocks or funds, they will sell you all the stocks and funds you can buy. If they are paid to 
grow your wealth, then you may have found a winner. More on this in Chapter 9.

Introduction

I often find myself yelling at the TV or crumpling up the offending newspaper 
or magazine, cursing the shortsightedness that pervades such “advice.”
If an investment recommendation is right for the long-term interests of the 
pension plans of Pennsylvania or Oklahoma or Hawaii, why isn’t the same 
advice right for somebody in their 40s or 50s? It certainly isn’t a matter of 
time horizon because a 50-year-old in good health could expect to live for 30 
to 50 more years. Given the pace of modern medicine, somebody in their 30s 
today might have at least 70 years to go. These long-term time horizons are 
no different from the long-range planning that pension plans must do. I think it 
is fair, therefore, to argue that the long-term view of a pension plan should be 
no different than it is for anybody in the fat part of their earning years, seeking 
to build wealth for their retirement, children, or grandchildren.
Sure, there are some small differences. Pension plans might invest 5% to 15% each 
in private equities (venture capital and leveraged buyouts), real estate, or hedge 
funds. Unless you have obscene amounts of money already, exactly replicating 
the set of investments available to, say, the South Dakota Teachers Retirement 
System probably isn’t in the cards for you. Similarly, if you can afford to invest  
8% of your net worth in a collection of office buildings around the country, as 
some pension plans might do, I doubt you are reading this sentence right now. 
(The people you pay to read this sentence for you should give me a call.)
However, as I will show in later chapters, there are ways to replicate the 
diversification advantages those exposures might bring through other invest­
ment vehicles. Moreover, although venture capital, real estate, and hedge fund 
investments tend to dominate the headlines, they are actually a small fraction 
of most institutions’ investments. There are notable exceptions, like the 
endowments of Harvard, Yale, and some other large foundations, who often 
invest up to half of their money in such things; but most retirement-related 
institutional investors have 80% to 100% of their investments in stocks and 
bonds. With a little bit of thinking and hard work on your part, you could build 
a portfolio every bit as diversified and risk-controlled as most multibillion-
dollar pension plans.
My goal is to give you the tools you need and the road map to get you there.

Throughout this book, I will use the graphic shown here, which I call the “Road 
Map to Financial Success,” to move us through the entire investment process 
that pension funds employ to manage their assets. I will note, however, that 
while the graphic appears as though it is suggesting that there is a single trip 
toward wealth, in practice (and as we will discuss in this book), wealth building 
is a continuous process. You never get to spike the football and head back to 
the bench. Successfully managing your assets and growing your wealth is an 
ongoing process. As a result, you need to be able to continuously balance the 
long-term view with short-term steps.
I start this book in Chapter 1 with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages 
that you have as an individual investor vis-à-vis the multibillion-dollar pension 
plans. Not surprisingly, there are things that pension plans can do with regard to 
fees, dedicated staff, and some types of asset classes that are largely impossible 
for regular people to copy exactly. However, with a little bit of creativity, you 
can use strategies that are “close enough” to generate returns that replicate the 
unavailable asset classes. You may not even miss having them in your portfolio! 
At the same time, individuals actually have a number of advantages over pension 
plans, including flexibility of action, lack of oversight and scrutiny, and a lack 
of political and outside pressures. While these advantages and disadvantages 
might prevent an individual from investing their assets as if they were building a 
perfect copy of, say, the State of Oregon Public Employees Retirement System, 
you would be surprised at just how close you can get.
Next, in Chapter 2, I will discuss asset allocation, which is the all-important 
task of determining how much of your money should be dedicated to various 
asset classes. Are you risk averse and want 80% of your portfolio invested 
in low-risk bonds? Do you have 40 years to retirement, little in assets, and 
an aggressive plan to save money and therefore want to take on high levels 
of risk in exchange for the prospect of superior returns? What should you 
do as life events change your plan? How does the process of simply growing 
older affect your investments over time? As I will show, determining the mix 
of assets that is appropriate to your needs dwarfs any other decision you 
make, including your selection of money managers or individual securities. If 
you decide to read only one chapter in this book, I recommend that this is 
the one you review.
In Chapters 3 through 6, I will lead you down the food chain from asset 
allocation to a discussion of the proper investment structure for both stocks 
and bonds. Studies have shown that the decisions you make regarding growth 
stocks versus value stocks, large capitalization stocks versus small capitalization 
stocks, core bonds (like Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds) 
versus high yield bonds, and so on, have the second-highest amount of impact 
on your portfolio. We will discuss ways to mitigate unwanted risks in your 
portfolio and show why chasing the latest “large cap growth” or “small cap 
value” trend can be hazardous to your financial health.

Introduction
xix
In Chapter 7 I get to the heart of what most people erroneously consider to 
be the most important element of investing: individual security and/or money 
manager (mutual funds, typically, for individual investors) selection. The vast 
majority of investors, including the multibillion-dollar pension plans that  
I work with, spend the lion’s share of their time reviewing how their investment 
managers are doing relative to some index and the managers’ peers; debating 
when to change to new managers; and then determining which investment 
managers are better than their current stable of partners. In reality, while these 
topics will take up more than 90% of your time, they will make maybe 5% of 
the difference in your returns. Selecting an investment manager is something 
that investors probably shouldn’t even waste their time on at all—except that 
investment managers are the only thing most investors can actually try to 
control on a short-term basis. Stay tuned.
In Chapter 8, I will discuss one of the true differentiators between individual 
investors and pension plans: “alternative” investments, a broad term that 
generally includes anything other than plain old stocks, bonds, and cash. Some 
alternative investments that you most likely have heard of include private 
equity, real estate, hedge funds, commodities, timberland, agricultural land, and 
some types of distressed debt, among others, and most have regulatory or 
practical hurdles that may be impossible for individual investors to surmount. 
Do you really need to invest in these types of assets? Why do pension plans 
do it? Are there proxies that can be used in place of these asset classes if they 
are not accessible to individuals? Do the cons outweigh the pros of these 
types of investments for individuals? What about for pension plans?
Although this book is designed to present you with a road map to financial 
success, you may need to rely on the services of financial institutions or 
qualified advisors to fill in the blanks that are particular to your situation. 
That’s why, in Chapter 9, I will discuss how to determine if these partners are 
in the business of helping your best interests—or their own. Of course, when 
you seek the help of a money manager to help guide your investment decisions, 
you will necessarily incur fees and expenses. However, you don’t have to pay 
an arm and a leg to achieve the returns you desire. In fact, choosing investment 
options that are the most cost effective is the single best way of improving 
performance and often can have an even greater impact on your results than 
selecting the right manager for your portfolio. As you’ll learn in this chapter, 
given two identical investment options, the one with the lower fees will serve 
you better over a long period of time.
Since I will be getting near the end of the book, in Chapter 10 I will provide 
some dessert for this meal of advice and regale you with the real-world 
experiences—both good and bad—of some of the plans and investment 
management products discussed in this book. This section is not meant simply 
to entertain, although you are certainly welcome to laugh all you want to. 
Rather, the goal of this chapter is to show you that even $100 billion plans

that have 50 staff members and the Treasury Secretary on speed dial can get 
things wrong once in a while. Understanding how some of these things can 
go wrong might help to prepare you for avoiding, or at least understanding, 
the worst case scenario: suffering a loss or major setback that imperils your 
financial future. In addition, if the moral of any of these stories helps you to 
avoid similar mistakes, everyone wins.
Finally, in Chapter 11, I will summarize the major lessons learned and the 
final advice that I have to give to you after you have absorbed all that I have 
shared.
Welcome to the first steps on your journey to financial success!

How You 
Compare to the 
Big Funds
Advantages and Disadvantages of Individual 
Investors
Large pension plans are the rock stars of the investment world. Everyone in 
the industry wants to manage a piece of their portfolio, and every industry  
­publication wants to interview their people and discuss their latest move.  When 
the trustees or investment staff at one of these plans makes an asset alloca-
tion change or replaces an investment manager, hundreds of ­millions (or even 
billions) of dollars can change hands rapidly, potentially making or breaking the 
careers of individuals working across the financial industry who sell or manage 
the kinds of portfolios in which large pension plans will invest.
Not only are large pension plans revered within the financial industry, but 
they also have significant advantages over their fellow market competitors, 
including individuals like you. First, because pension plans generally have huge 
economies of scale, they are able to negotiate fees that are well below “mar-
ket” rates. Because it costs a money manager virtually the same amount in 
operational expenses to invest $100 million that it does to invest $500 million  
1

Chapter 1 | How You Compare to the Big Funds
2
(just buy five times as many shares, in the latter case), it’s not uncommon 
for money managers to be very flexible about the fees they charge pension 
plans for managing very large portfolios. Second, some money managers will 
custom-tailor investment portfolios to the needs of the largest plans, and they 
may even dedicate sales or client service staff to their biggest investors. Some 
of the very largest pension plans have recently started forming “strategic 
partnerships” with investment management firms where they have exclusive 
access to a firm’s research and personnel, enabling them to incorporate these 
unique insights into the pension plan’s decision-making process.
How can you or I or any individual investor compete against 800-pound gorillas 
like that in the marketplace? Don’t they have all the contacts and information? 
It sure seems that way when you read the articles in the financial press that 
glow about the strategies employed by some of the nation’s largest pension 
plans that are unavailable to the average individual.
Is there anything the individual can do to level that playing field? At first glance, 
it may seem like individuals have little chance of competing against these behe-
moths. However, although it may not be readily apparent at first, there are 
plenty of opportunities out there for all investors, if they are willing to look 
for them. In this chapter I address the question of whether there is anything 
that the major pension plans do that the little investor can replicate—even if 
he or she must do so on a different scale and with the aid of an off-the-shelf 
source. In addition, I will identify some possible advantages that individual 
investors surprisingly have versus these giants.
Although it is important to recognize that the individual investor is very 
clearly playing the role of David in the battle of David versus Goliath, David 
can still compete and sometimes can even win, just as he did in the fable. Yes, 
many advantages flow to the largest players in the investment marketplace, 
but there are still lots of things you and I can do to level the playing field for 
ourselves.
Advantages of the Individual Investor
Advantage 1: Freedom from External Pressure  
Regarding Your Amount of Contributions into Your 
Retirement Plan
Your largest advantage as an individual investor is that you are free from 
having to decide in conjunction with external parties how much or how little 
should be contributed into your retirement savings. If you find that your 
current savings or your projection of how much you will have saved by a given 
future date is not sufficient, you can make the decision on your own (or in 

Invest Like an Institution
3
conjunction with your spouse or heirs) about how to fix that. Do you need 
to reduce your future expectations of how lavishly you will live in retirement? 
Maybe downsize the boat or RV you plan to buy someday? Or do you want to 
double your monthly savings? Any or all of these are reasonable ways to get 
back on track. Ultimately, the decision over which one to choose is yours, and 
it can be made relatively quickly and painlessly.
For a pension plan, the decision to modify contributions into the investment 
portfolio is not nearly that simple. The benefits (the future retirement commit-
ments to employees) are often collectively bargained and contractual, making 
them extremely hard to change—witness the outrage in 2011 by teachers and 
others when a newly elected governor reduced pension benefits. Additional 
funding for a public plan, if needed, comes from the taxpayers, and you are 
guaranteed that a large fraction of the members of the press, public, and 
political classes will always object if tax rates or government spending needs 
to increase, especially in the current economic environment where it seems 
like every public agency is being asked to do more with less. Although these 
battles over contributions and benefits can be fought and sometimes won by 
the powers that rule pension plans, it is far more pleasant to decide with your 
spouse over dinner one night to find an extra $500 a month to sock away 
than it is to wage a multiyear war in the courts and press for an additional  
$5 billion a year of taxpayer money.
Advantage 2: Freedom from Inflated Expectations
Although I don’t want to say that pension plans are unrealistic about the future, 
given that most of their forward-looking return expectations are roughly in 
line with the 100-year history of market returns, they are uniformly “highly 
optimistic” that strong markets and returns will persist in the future—which 
is the second biggest advantage that you have as an individual investor over 
pension plans. When public pension plans budget over the long term how 
much the city or state needs to contribute to the plan every year, the calculation  
is based at least in part on their long-term return expectation, which often 
ranges between 7% to 9% (one city plan even has a 10% return expectation).  
The higher the pension plan assumes their future returns will be, after all, the 
less the taxpayers need to contribute to the plan each year since a higher 
return assumption means that more of the future benefit payments are 
expected to come from investment returns, not contributions. A reduction of 
that discount rate by even as little as 0.25% or 0.50% can mean hundreds of 
millions of dollars, or even billions of dollars, in required additional annual con-
tributions of taxpayer money to the largest plans to maintain the same level 
of benefit security. As a result, even though many public pension plan trustees 
would love to reduce return expectations to better ensure that the fund 

Chapter 1 | How You Compare to the Big Funds
4
earns a return at least as good as what is expected of it, the pressure to keep 
assumptions where they are to minimize increases in required contributions 
is typically overwhelming from the city or state that sponsors the plan and is 
facing its own budget squeeze. A rule of thumb that I have observed over the 
years is that for every 0.25% to 0.50% reduction in the expected future rate of 
return, a pension plan needs to increase contributions by about 10%. In today’s 
budget environment, that kind of increase in spending by almost any govern-
ment can be a very difficult proposition, no matter how much it increases the 
stability and security of the pension plan in the future by decreasing the chance 
that the long-term returns will underperform that optimistic goal. Instead, 
cash-strapped plan sponsors often need to maintain aggressive expectations of 
future returns, resulting in a level of risk required to reach these lofty targets 
that can lead to significant losses from time to time.
This presents a huge advantage for the individual investor over pension plans 
as far as reaching stated goals is concerned. You get to be as realistic, or even 
as pessimistic, as you want to be! Do you want to reduce risk in your portfolio  
and increase your bond holdings? Your return expectation might fall from  
7% to 4%, and you will have to save more and spend less in retirement, but no 
one is stopping you from doing that. If you follow the most optimistic set of 
assumptions around and plan as if you will always earn 9% per year, and then 
miss that target most of the time, at retirement you will be short of the level 
of assets that you had hoped to accumulate, making for a tough retirement. 
On the other hand, even if you still believe deep in your heart that returns 
will be 9%, but you contribute and budget as if you will earn only 5%, there 
is a very good chance that you and your heirs might have a pleasant surprise 
when you reach retirement.
In the next chapter, I will discuss how to develop the asset allocation mix, as 
well as the resulting return and risk expectations, that is right for your needs. 
For now, as well as in that chapter and throughout this book, I will encourage 
my readers to be as conservative with their investments as possible. If you 
plan for weak returns or relatively large risks and losses, and you contribute 
to your savings as if you have not saved enough, there is a far better chance 
that you will enter retirement in a strong financial situation than when you 
merely wish upon a star for high returns to compensate for weak savings.
Advantage 3: Size
We often don’t think of small size as an advantage in the investment arena, and 
I outlined earlier in this chapter the many advantages that can flow to a very 
large investor. However, if you understand how your smaller size can work in 
your favor, it can be instrumental to your success. As I will discuss in the next 

Invest Like an Institution
5
section in this chapter regarding the disadvantages the individual faces, and as 
I alluded to in the introduction to this chapter, pension plans have tremendous 
advantages in access to well-performing investment funds, alternative asset 
classes (more on this in Chapter 8), and lower fees due to economies of scale. 
Unfortunately, they also can find themselves resembling a sailing oil tanker, 
unable to turn on a dime. Smaller investors, by definition, are more nimble  
in the marketplace than very large investors, because an individual’s decision 
to move tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars between 
investment managers or asset classes can be accomplished far more quickly 
and easily, and at a lower relative cost, than a pension plan’s decision to move 
billions of dollars. Although I will discourage using this nimbleness to chase 
trends or time the markets later in this book, it is important to recognize than 
when a change does need to be made, an individual can do it far more cheaply 
and easily than a large institution.
Another advantage that stems from your smaller size is the ability to take 
advantage of opportunities that would not make a meaningful difference to a 
large pension plan. An investment with a limited capacity could have a tremen-
dous impact on your portfolio but may not even amount to a rounding error 
for a large pension plan. In many cases, the largest plans find themselves having 
to dismiss investing in what could turn out to be great ideas simply because 
the potential gain is so small in relation to the total assets that they simply do 
not have the available staff or interest to pursue it.
Advantage 4: Freedom from Distracting External 
Pressures
Managing a pension plan, especially a large one that draws a lot of attention or 
scrutiny, can be a very difficult job. The staffs of these plans and their boards 
of trustees have tremendous pressure on them to satisfy a wide variety of 
external and internal constituents. By and large, the public pension plans with 
which I have worked over the years have strived as hard as they can to balance 
all these external pressures, but no one would argue with the fact that many 
of the investment decisions made by these boards, like most decisions made 
by practically any committee, are often compromises among these competing 
pressures. In contrast to those pension Trustees who have the unenviable job 
of trying to navigate this minefield of external interests, the final advantage 
that you bring to the table in the creation of your own retirement plan is 
the fact that you get to design an investment portfolio that is 100% right for 
your needs, without compromise. You don’t have constituents or employees  
watching and dissecting your every move. The press doesn’t report on 

Chapter 1 | How You Compare to the Big Funds
6
­everything you do. No members of the public show up at your meetings,  
berating you for making money off of something that might have externalities.1
As an individual investor, you also do not necessarily have to conform with 
the requirements of socially responsible investing (SRI), which increasingly is 
a factor that some large pension plans and many major endowments and 
foundations need to address. Investment managers at many institutional inves-
tors, especially those affiliated with a religious order or university, typically 
must follow guidelines that prohibit them from investing in companies whose 
lines of business are objectionable to the organization. Catholic organizations, 
for example, often limit investments in defense contractors or manufacturers 
of certain reproduction-related pharmaceuticals. Other religiously affiliated 
groups may object to investments in alcohol or gaming companies (the latter 
of which is the industry euphemism for casino gambling). Similarly, the pension 
plans of health care providers may prohibit investment in tobacco companies 
by their investment managers, while Middle Eastern clients may pass over 
investments in financial institutions that make money from lending and interest  
income in violation of Sharia Law.
Such restrictions are a way for investors to avoid profiting from activities or 
businesses that they find objectionable and to make a public statement of 
their beliefs. If an investor wishes to pursue such a strategy, such as avoiding 
all investments in oil companies because he or she finds pollution objection-
able, then that investor should invest accordingly. I would never argue that SRI 
strategies should not be pursued if it is meaningful to the client and the client 
understands the potential impact on investment returns, and a large number 
of my institutional clients over the years have had one or more of these 
restrictions on their portfolios. After all, it is their money, and they need to 
sleep comfortably at night with the decisions they have made and the sources 
of their investment profits.
1An externality refers to a typically negative implication of an action to some other party 
that doesn’t directly affect you. For example, investing in a real estate fund that makes 
money by evicting low-income tenants and raising rents, an oil company that isn’t perfectly 
clean with its industrial wastes, a tobacco stock that makes its money selling addictive 
carcinogens, or a private equity company that improves profits by closing down factories 
and shipping jobs to China are all perfectly legal, potentially highly profitable, and very 
common investment strategies. However, all of these investments result in ill effects for 
other people. If you choose not to invest in one or all of these, someone else who isn’t 
guided by the same compass will gladly take your place. If you do choose to invest in them, 
though, it is highly unlikely that the people affected by these investments will show up at 
your door, protesting how your money ruined their lives. With a large public pension plan 
or a major college endowment, angry constituents frequently appear at public meetings to 
protest the actions the fund has taken when they have these external consequences.

Invest Like an Institution
7
However, investors should be aware that these types of strategies can come at 
a cost to their investment returns. Any type of limited or restricted portfolio 
will underperform a more diverse portfolio over the long term. If two active 
investment managers are managing similar portfolios and one can choose 
among all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index while the other can only pick from 
450, the 500-stock manager will most likely outperform in the long run. Sure, 
I can find a year (or maybe even a decade) where a tobacco and alcohol-free 
portfolio underperforms a non-restricted portfolio. But over one hundred 
years, the manager with more options available should do better by exploiting 
every option in the opportunity set.
When avoiding an industry in protest of its products or past actions, it is 
important to understand that while that might make a very important moral 
difference to you, it is unlikely that your decision to avoid investing in a 
particular company will make much of an impact on that industry’s returns. 
If there are profits to be made, someone else will gladly buy the stocks you 
refuse to buy. For example, many of the largest pension and health care plans 
in the country refuse to buy tobacco stocks, since these plans are respon-
sible for their members’ health care costs and do not want to invest in an 
industry that costs them so much money and does so much damage to their 
members’ health—a completely understandable objection to profiting from a 
product or supporting an industry that directly hurts their membership. Still, 
despite the large number of institutional and individual investors who refuse 
to buy their stocks, tobacco companies just keep on ticking year after year 
after year. True, smoking and lung cancer deaths are on the downturn in the 
United States—but this is more due to a public education campaign about 
the ills of smoking than it is to the decision by the State of XYZ or the ABC 
Healthcare Company to sell its shares in Philip Morris. Elsewhere in the world, 
where prevention efforts are less common, Philip Morris and its competitors 
are doing a fine job replacing customers more quickly than they kill them.  
So, whereas the divestment of tobacco stocks from many portfolios is completely 
reasonable as a statement of principle, it has not caused tobacco companies 
to go out of business.
In fact, despite the divestment activities of so many large investors, some of 
these “sin stocks,” as they are known, actually have done very well. For exam-
ple, in a study that I undertook for a pension plan client, I found that from 
2001 to 2012, excluding tobacco stocks hurt the performance of their equity 
portfolio against a broad market benchmark that includes tobacco companies 
in 11 of those 12 years. By the end of the 12-year period, choosing to avoid 
profiting from tobacco had cost the system more than 3% of their equity 
assets in aggregate. Despite this mounting evidence of the opportunity cost 
of the decision, the client decided to continue to exclude tobacco out of a 
continuing objection to the industry, its products, and the health impacts on 
its membership.

The one main exception to this rule that divestment does not directly force 
change was South Africa in the 1980s. The vast majority of institutional inves-
tors (and many governments and individuals) locked arms and refused to 
invest in any company that did business with the apartheid regime. It took 
years of trade and investment restrictions, as well as government pressure, 
athletic competition blockades, travel limitations, and more, but the regime 
finally fell. Although the effectiveness of the apartheid investment embargo 
was certainly impressive, keep in mind that this situation represents a rare 
case that happened on a scale that dwarfs your personal refusal to invest in 
something—or even the refusal by a handful of state pension plans whose 
assets might total hundreds of billions of dollars—and constituted far more 
than a mere ban on stock investment. In most normal cases, unless everyone 
refuses to play ball, there are plenty of other parties who are still willing to 
invest when the opportunity is right, despite any moral reservations about a 
company or an industry.
If we as a society agree that certain businesses, industries, or countries need 
to be isolated for the welfare of all, divestment can work as a strategy if it 
is as widespread as was the effort against South Africa. On the other hand, if 
divestment is done piecemeal, with each individual or organization expressing 
a limited and mutually exclusive view of objectionable practices or industries, 
the conscience of each investor may be improved—but it is unlikely to impact 
society as a whole.
In my experience, most pension plan boards understand all of this. They know 
that divesting from something may cost them money over the long term. 
However, the pressure from the membership, public, media, or others to 
divest from certain stocks or industries can be too much to bear. Sometimes, 
despite this cost, the Trustees of the plan divest because they simply believe it 
is the right thing to do. In other cases, the path of least resistance is to simply 
give in to the pressure being exerted on them and divest. Regardless of the 
reason for agreeing to divest, the plan may need to replace the profits they 
just gave up with higher contributions from the taxpayers. If avoiding a number 
of stocks or bonds costs the fund 1% per year, then an increase in contribu-
tions or a decrease in future benefits will have to make up the difference.
What is the bottom line of this discussion for you, the individual investor?  
I intended this section to explain that one of the major advantages you have 
as an individual investor over pension plans is that you get to do what is right 
for you without compromise. If you want to invest in something, you can. No 
one is watching. No one is pressuring you. If you want to invest in British 
Petroleum 5 minutes after an oil well blows up, a huge body of water is pol-
luted, 300,000 sea birds die, and the stock drops 60%, you can do it—precisely 
at the same time a major university is being forced to sell its stock at the bot-
tom by students outraged by the company’s conduct. You can keep the long 
view in mind and seek profits wherever you can find them without worrying 

Invest Like an Institution

about picketers on your front lawn. As much as they wish they could keep 
as objective an outlook as possible in mind, many large institutional investors 
recognize that they must answer to constituent groups that might prevent 
them from taking such an action, yielding a huge advantage to individuals able 
to act without the same level of scrutiny.
Remember, your greatest advantage is that you (and your spouse and family) 
are your one and only constituency. No one else’s needs have to be balanced 
with your own. There are no private equity CEOs whose favor needs to be 
courted in exchange for access to a future fund, no unions to serve, no elected 
officials to please, no taxpayers to appeal to. The impact of all of these exter-
nal influences varies from pension fund to pension fund, but there is no argu-
ing that investment returns would be better in an environment removed from 
all of these non-investment pressures—which, fortunately, is exactly what you 
have in your favor.
Disadvantages of the Individual Investor
I don’t want to paint too perfect of a picture, however. If investing was as 
simple as I have made it out to be thus far in this chapter, pension funds 
wouldn’t have staffs of dozens or even hundreds of people, boards of trustees, 
and external investment consultants. If pension plans consistently outperform 
individual investors by 1% or 2%, as I discussed in the Introduction to this book,  
there must be some clear reasons for their success. Otherwise, all the problems 
outlined previously that pension plans face would render the opposite result, 
and individual investors historically would have achieved better performance.
So, what disadvantages do you have versus the large funds? I will discuss them 
in the following section and then spend many other sections in this book, 
including the chapters on investment structure (Chapter 3 through Chapter 
6), manager selection (Chapter 7), and cost reduction (Chapter 9), helping to 
find you ways to mitigate their impact.
Disadvantage 1: You Only Live Once
First and foremost, you only have one work career to build a sufficient pool 
of assets by retirement, and if you outlive your assets, you lack the recourse 
available to most pension funds. Public pension funds rely on taxpayers as 
their ultimate financial backstop, and corporate plans can turn to the company 
for additional contributions, if necessary, or to the federal pension insurance 
company, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, should the company 
face bankruptcy. Endowments and foundations can turn to grateful alumni or 
charitable contributors when times are tough to help bring the value of the 
investment portfolio back to the needed level.

Chapter 1 | How You Compare to the Big Funds

Unless you are one of the declining number of people covered at least in part 
by a traditional defined benefit pension plan, you have none of these supports, 
except for a social security benefit. If you invest in something that is too risky 
and suffer major losses—or if you spend from your savings after you retire 
as if you plan to live for 10 years and instead end up living for 40—you have 
no sponsoring entity like taxpayers, corporate income, or university alumni to 
make additional contributions to keep your retirement account solvent.
As a result, you need to maintain dual goals in mind at all times: (1) solid 
growth of the contributions you make and the assets you already hold (the 
same as a pension plan) and (2) a far greater focus on downside protection 
than even most pension plans entertain. While a 50% drop in value will signifi-
cantly impact a pension plan and the plan sponsor, resulting in far higher con-
tributions by the government entity backing the plan and likely higher taxes on 
individuals under its jurisdiction, or a reduction in corporate earnings due to 
the need to divert more of the company’s income into the pension plan, the 
public or corporate pension plan will likely live to fight another day and will 
eventually recover. For individuals, that type of decline in the value of the port-
folio could be fiscally fatal to an individual near retirement because there is no 
backstop to turn to for that individual to make up the newfound shortfall.
Disadvantage 2: Uncertain Time Frame
As alluded to previously, your time frame is uncertain: Will you live to be 
70 or 100? While family history may be some guide (if every recent female 
ancestor made it to 95, for example, and you are female and in good health, 
you have a higher probability of a long retirement than other people whose 
ancestors typically do not survive past age 70), nothing is certain. The contin-
ued improvement in medical care compounds this issue. If your family has a 
history of heart disease in men, for example, leading to early death, simply tak-
ing a daily dose of Lipitor or Zocor might give you decades more than those 
that came before you. For someone only in their 20s or 30s, there exists the 
very real possibility that major afflictions like heart disease, cancer, stroke, and 
other ailments could be cured by the time you are 80, resulting in extended 
life spans previously never thought to be possible. Or you might be one of 
those lucky people who smokes, eats bacon, never works out, and yet lives to 
110. The problem that individuals face is the uncertainty of how much money 
they will need in retirement, because we simply have no way of projecting how 
long any given person might live.
Although most people would probably be happy to spend an extra decade 
or more on earth, the possibility that you may live longer than you expect 
to poses the real risk that your assets may not be sufficient to your needs 
in retirement. It also is a risk that pension plans do not need to consider as 
strongly as you do. While no one can predict how long a given individual will 

Invest Like an Institution
11
live with any precision, predicting the average age and distribution of ages 
at death for a population of 100,000 can be done fairly precisely, thanks to 
advances in modern actuarial science. As a result, a pension plan can calculate 
how much money is needed to support 100,000 people in retirement as a 
whole, even though we cannot precisely predict how much any single one of 
them will need or how long any individual will live.
As a result, downside mitigation (protecting your investments from large 
losses, especially when you are close to retirement) and over-saving are the 
best defenses against outliving your assets. If you expect to live for 15 years 
after retirement, there is no harm in saving throughout your working career 
as if you expect to live for 25 years, or in reducing spending once you retire 
to stretch the savings you have accumulated over 15 years into enough to last 
for 20 years or more. The worst outcome of such an approach to asset con-
servation would be that you leave your heirs, alma mater, or favorite charity 
something after you are gone—which is a far better outcome than spending 
an unexpected final 8 years in poverty.
Disadvantage 3: Lack of Time to Dedicate  
to ­Investing
Managing your assets is most likely not your full-time job. Major pension plans 
and the largest endowments can employ dozens or even hundreds of financial 
professionals whose primary responsibility it is to manage the plan’s assets, and 
there are real benefits to having talented and qualified individuals reviewing  
and evaluating a variety of investment opportunities on a constant basis.
While I will discuss throughout this book the many benefits of maintaining 
a long-term investment approach with minimal day-to-day tinkering, there is 
obviously some merit to having professionals watch and manage the assets of 
a pension plan on an ongoing basis. They can do more research into the lat-
est strategies than you have time to do, know their investment managers far 
better than you ever will, and employ the most advanced tools to understand 
the real risks underlying their portfolios. Bear in mind, though, that the flip 
side to this is that your lack of dedicated staff prevents constant change and  
micromanagement of your investments, which might be an advantage in disguise.  
As I will discuss in Chapter 9 on fees and expenses, reducing transactions 
costs and the drag on assets from making frequent changes can be as great 
a benefit to returns as finding an investment that actually makes you money! 
After all, as Ben Franklin once put it, a penny saved is a penny earned.

Chapter 1 | How You Compare to the Big Funds

Disadvantage 4: Fewer Investment Options
As an individual investor, many of the investment options available to large 
pension funds will simply not be open to you. Investment managers that offer 
products in private equity investments, real estate investments, and hedge 
funds may have limited lists of desired clients or minimum investment sizes 
that exceed your means. In addition, building your own portfolio of direct 
investments in real estate (your own portfolio of office buildings, for example) 
or private equities also may be well beyond the means of most private inves-
tors. In Chapter 8, I will discuss alternatives to these types of direct invest-
ments through liquid, publicly traded vehicles that can work as the nearest 
available proxy. They aren’t a perfect fit, but they may be better than nothing. 
Or, you may conclude, they simply are not worth the cost. Frankly, there are 
even some large pension plans that have come to the same conclusion about 
alternative investments and have limited their portfolios to a combination of 
stocks and bonds.
Disadvantage 5: Inadequate Access to Information
The largest investors have a myriad of sources of independent, accurate, and 
complete data and information. Large pension plans retain the services of 
investment consultants (or armies of consultants, in some cases) and purchase 
or otherwise have access to vast databases of information about potential 
investments, their returns, their holdings, their personnel, their organiza-
tions, and the inner workings of their investment process. What do you have? 
Access to Yahoo! Finance, the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, and a variety of 
other publications and internet data sources that every other investor gets 
to share. These are neither unique nor complete sources of information and 
can leave you with far less data about your investment options than a pen-
sion fund may have. However, as we will discuss in Chapter 7, the selection of 
active managers is far less important than popular opinion holds. While there 
is no question you are at a disadvantage versus pension plans when it comes 
to obtaining complete and accurate information about all your investment 
options, I again will show you ways to mitigate the damage that might be done 
by that disadvantage.
Disadvantage 6: The Problems with Mutual Funds
Mutual funds are not perfect replications of the types of portfolios in which 
pension plans invest. Mutual funds have looser guidelines, more cash hold-
ings, and greater turnover than the “institutional quality” portfolios that the  
same investment managers might offer to pension plans. As I will show in 
Chapters 5 through 7, the selection of funds that minimize these negatives is 
paramount to success.

Invest Like an Institution
13
Disadvantage 7: Fees, Fees, Fees
Finally, on an apples-to-apples basis, individual investors will pay higher invest-
ment management fees than will pension plans. If you give a money manager 
$10,000 in some strategy and a pension plan gives them $100,000,000 in that 
same strategy, the pension plan will pay less in fees than you will, since the 
fees charged for large institutional portfolios are normally less than those for 
retail mutual funds. Even if you were able to precisely match the investment 
managers and asset allocation used by a given pension plan, you will tend to 
underperform the investments made by that large plan based solely on the 
difference between their fees and yours. At the same time, however, that pen-
sion plan will have to pay custodial bank fees, overhead operational expenses, 
and the salaries of its dedicated staff—all of which you can avoid, assuming 
that managing your portfolio is not your full-time job. Given that fees and 
expenses can be the largest drain on investment performance over long peri-
ods of time, I will dedicate Chapter 9 to a discussion of what you can do to 
mitigate their impact.
As I said previously, precisely emulating the asset allocation, manager lineup, 
and returns of your favorite large public pension plan is impossible. Far too 
many hurdles exist along your investment path. However, once you under-
stand both your advantages and disadvantages as an individual investor versus 
your larger investment brethren, you can seek ways to reduce your disadvan-
tages and increase the payoffs from your advantages. Even if you can only close 
the gap a little between your returns and those of a pension plan, every little 
bit helps! As I will show in Chapter 9, even a reduction in expenses of as little 
as 0.10% a year can have a tremendous impact over a 40-year career and a 
subsequent 30-year retirement.
Summary
It can be done. If you follow the plan laid out in this book, focusing your atten-
tion on asset allocation and a steady, disciplined investment and contribution 
schedule over time, your retirement assets can grow as you need them to. 
By minimizing unwanted “dumb” risks and maximizing your chances to profit 
from “smart” risks, which will be discussed in Chapters 3 through 6 and again 
in Chapter 10, your path to success becomes even clearer.
Yes, you do not have a staff of experts assisting you every day with every 
investment decision you make. Although I will discuss in both Chapter 2 and 
Chapter 9 how some outside advisors can be useful to an individual investor, 
they are not your permanent assistants in the same way as the staff is to a 
large pension plan. You and your family are generally on your own, which can 
be both a blessing and a curse.

As I will say time and time again throughout this book, the ability to be 
disciplined in your contributions and realistic in planning for your retirement 
spending plans is the single greatest secret to financial success. It also happens 
to be your greatest advantage versus large pension plans, which need to take 
into account the interests of a myriad of affected and interested parties in 
every investment decision that they make.
Thinking that you can have investment returns that approximate those of a 
$100 billion, market moving, major investor seems like a daunting proposition. 
Indeed, it is. However, much like the prospect of climbing a mountain or 
running a marathon might be intimidating to the average person but entirely 
achievable with the right training and planning, generating investment returns 
that fulfill your needs can be done with a steady approach like the one 
outlined in the pages that follow.

Asset Allocation
The Largest Determinant of a Retirement  
Plan’s Return
In the beginning of this book, I introduced the following graphic, the Road 
Map to Financial Success, which shows the flow chart to get you on your 
way to a healthy portfolio. 
The first step in building any financial plan is asset allocation. “Asset alloca-
tion” is the technical name for the process within which an investor deter-
mines how much of his or her assets should be put into stocks, bonds, cash, 
real estate, or any other asset class. This process should not be a shot in the 
dark or taken lightly, nor should it be subject to constant fluctuation or the 
whims of an investor’s reaction to market movements.
Rather, asset allocation should be consistent with an individual’s financial goals, 
savings rate, and required rate of return. Most important, asset  allocation 
should be based heavily on an individual’s risk tolerance as well as the com-
bination of asset classes that will produce the optimal expected return and

risk characteristics for his or her needs. For example, most academic research 
and practical industry experience says that a long-term investor who has a 
long time horizon until his or her assets will need to be drawn down should 
tend to invest heavily in riskier assets that will generate superior returns over 
a long period of time. On the other hand, an individual nearing retirement 
should be far more concerned about the possibility of significant losses that 
will impact the quality of his or her retirement than the prospect of contin-
ued asset growth and will therefore invest more heavily in low risk, income-
generating assets.
If you’re worried about how to establish a proper asset allocation mix, fear 
not. In this chapter, I will walk you through a straightforward process for 
determining the right asset allocation for your needs. I will also discuss the 
various online tools and in-person advice you can leverage to simplify the 
process for you. Before I begin, however, I’d like you to consider a statistic that 
floats around the pension industry like a “Golden Rule.” Various studies have 
confirmed that 90% to 100% of the difference in return among pension plans, 
endowments, or any other types of investors comes from asset allocation.
Think about how meaningful that is for a minute: 90%.
While the headlines in the magazines trumpet the performance of great 
mutual funds versus the S&P 500 Index, and the ads on TV during golf events 
tout how well those mutual funds have performed against their “Lipper Peer 
Group Averages”,1  the performance advantage that comes from a superior 
mutual fund contributes less than 10% to the total return of your portfolio. 
Granted, 10% is meaningful, and it is important to pick the right funds once 
you have established your investment structure. However, most individual 
investors spend a lot more than 10% of their limited investment time figuring 
out which mutual fund to invest in.
Generally speaking, institutional investors have made the same mistake. If 
most businesses have the 80/20 rule, whereby 20% of a company’s clients or 
revenues requires 80% of the employees’ time, then the investment industry 
should have the 90/10 rule. More than 90% of most investors’ time is spent 
picking money managers that generate less than 10% of their results. Although 
you should never alter your asset allocation on a whim or on a daily basis, as 
I will discuss later in this chapter, you need to recognize the important role 
that asset allocation plays in determining your financial outcome and periodi-
cally review your plan to make sure that it fits your long-term needs. In this 
next section, I illustrate the large differences in return that asset allocation 
can make.

Example: Three Individuals and Their Differing 
Asset Allocations
Let’s consider the example of three individual investors with markedly differ-
ent asset allocation plans. In this first example, I will assume that each of them 
invests solely in index funds:
1.	 Bob has a high risk tolerance and, at age 30, is many years 
until retirement. He is investing from every paycheck and 
can live with a few years of poor performance because he 
doesn’t mind buying stocks when the market is down. In 
fact, whenever he gets a chance to buy after a decline, he 
calls it “bottom feasting.” For the period of our study, Bob 
has a portfolio that is comprised of 80% US stocks/20% 
bonds.
2.	 Susan is in her early 40s and has both a slightly shorter 
time horizon than Bob and a lower risk tolerance. In 
addition, with three kids approaching college age, Susan 
is uncertain as to how much she will be able to invest 
over the next several years while she and her husband 
pay for tuition. While she still wants to grow her assets, 
she is also concerned about taking a big loss in any one 
year that will set her off course. With the help of her 
advisor, Susan determined that a 60% stock (half US, half 
non-US)/40% bond portfolio is best for her.
3.	 John recently retired and is in good enough health that he 
expects to live for many years. He also has been fortunate 
enough to amass enough wealth that he will probably be 
able to pass something on to his heirs when he is gone. 
Whereas his advisor suggested that most retirees prefer a 
portfolio exclusively in income investments, John preferred 
a 25% US stock/75% bond portfolio to allow a decent frac-
tion of his portfolio to continue to grow over time.
Take a look at the year-by-year performance of each of the three investors2 
in Table 2-1. What should be readily apparent are the huge differences in 
performance each investor achieved on an annual basis, yet they all ended up 
in roughly the same place.3 Given the highly volatile performance of a number 
2All calculations assume annual rebalancing at year end to target portfolio weights.
3This is due in part to the exceptionally strong bond market over the last decade, which 
had results that rivaled equities in some years.  That past performance is unlikely to persist, 
given that rates cannot fall much more, and will lead to a far stronger argument for a 
diversified portfolio in the future, when asset classes begin to diverge again.

Chapter 2 | Asset Allocation
18
of stock and bond markets over the last two-plus decades, the differences 
among them in total are far smaller than one might have guessed. Still, that 
1.4% advantage Bob had over John equates roughly to the advantage the aver-
age defined-benefit plan has had over a defined-contribution plan. That small 
difference can add up.
There are four themes to remember from this chart.
First, the long-term cycle of the financial markets averages out investor per-
formance, if you can stomach the ride. In the mid-to-late 1990s, when stocks 
roared ahead, Bob outperformed Susan and John due to his aggressive stance 
in that asset class. Similarly, when stocks collapsed after the Internet bubble 
burst in 2000 and the credit crisis of 2007–2008 began, his losses far exceeded 
those of his peers. However, in the long run, he “won.” Just as the typical 
“invest for the long term” advice predicted, Bob’s higher risk asset allocation 
generated higher returns over this 22-year period.
The second theme is to keep your investing time frame appropriate to your 
needs if you even want to try to stomach the ride of a long-term market

cycle. If Bob had been planning to retire in 2002, for example, his high-risk 
80%/20% allocation mix would have been completely inappropriate because 
he would have found himself beginning to liquidate his investments to fund his 
retirement at the very bottom of the market cycle. After all, given the kinds 
of losses that can be incurred in any particular year with an 80/20 mix, there 
simply would not have been time for Bob to bounce back if his retirement 
was looming.
The third theme is simple: stay with it. If you are investing long term and you 
have the long term in mind, keep the long term in mind. If Bob had gotten 
scared in 2002 or 2008 and pulled out of the market, he would have missed 
the recoveries in 2003 and 2009. When you select your asset allocation, you 
should anticipate that for every few great years, there will be a few lousy 
years. The great years will offset the impact of the lousy years—as long as the 
lousy years do not lead you to move to a completely cash portfolio when you 
see your asset value drop 25%.
In Bob’s case, his assets grew by 77.3% from the beginning of 2003 through the 
end of 2007 and had recovered to his 1999 asset level by the end of 2004. If he 
had gotten scared by the market decline and retreated to cash after the end 
of the tech bust, he would have missed some spectacular returns, especially 
in 2003.
Fourth, there are other ways to diversify a portfolio beyond simply investing in 
stocks and bonds. For Susan, her decision to pursue a different asset allocation 
mix from Bob and John and invest outside the United States helped her greatly 
in 1993, 2002, 2004, and 2005, when she performed as well as, or better than, 
Bob, despite his 20% greater allocation to stocks. However, before we all run 
out and buy exclusively non-US stock funds, notice 1992, 2001, 2011, and 2012. 
Despite her more conservative investment style, Susan got burned relative to 
Bob’s investments when the international stock markets tanked. Had Susan 
invested her 60% in stocks solely in the United States, her return would have 
been 8.81% per year on average, indicating that the international diversifica-
tion, at least in this example, mitigated her annual volatility but also held down 
her total return for the period relative to the other two investors.
Despite the apparent negative performance implication in Susan’s example, I 
present many more reasons why diversifying your stock portfolio outside the 
United States makes sense in Chapter 4, when I discuss the rationale for a 
global equity portfolio.
Getting on a steady path to success takes time and patience, but it all starts 
with one step. As the old adage goes, “A journey of a thousand miles begins 
with a single step.” From an investment perspective, the equivalent of this say-
ing is, “A retirement plan with a million dollars begins with a single dollar.” But 
it does not stop there. A retirement plan with a million dollars starts with a 
single dollar, regular contributions, strong earnings, and the discipline to stick

with it until you reach your goal. There are few stories of overnight riches 
when it comes to investing. Without the next Cisco or Google starting up 
in your garage, reaching your financial goals will take years and years of work, 
discipline, and continuous planning.
Asset Allocation and You
In asset  allocation, there is planning—and then there is OVERplanning. 
Although I cannot overstate the value in creating an investment plan and 
sticking to it (more on this later on in this chapter, when I discuss the value 
of regular contributions), investors also have to be careful to avoid tinkering 
with their portfolios too much.
Most institutional investors take a long-term view of asset allocation, and so 
should you. They do not attempt to “time” the markets, shifting in and out of 
stocks and bonds based on the latest economic data. Instead, pension plans 
commonly pick an asset allocation that is designed to fit their needs for the next 
decade or more. Based on the demographics of the population of contribut-
ing and retired members within their plan, they can predict roughly how much 
they will need in assets and cash flow for benefits in the future. As a result, they 
can determine how aggressive or conservative their investments need to be to 
achieve the returns that they need to fund those benefits. They can also estimate 
how much they need to contribute to the pension plan on an annual basis.
Large plans have an advantage in this respect over the individual investor, in 
that they know when their members are going to die and will invest accord-
ingly. That may be overstating the point very slightly. They don’t know pre-
cisely how long any given member of the plan will live, but they do know how 
long each member will live on average. Based on the laws of large numbers, 
actuaries can predict that X members of the pension plan will die this year and 
that the average 38-year-old plan member, for example, will live for 41 more 
years.4  Sure, some will beat the odds and live to 100, but others will succumb 
to disease or car crashes in the next few years. On average, the demographic 
behavior of a population of 1,000 or 10,000 or 100,000 people in a pension 
plan is fairly predictable.
In planning for retirement, it is safe to assume the worst, and in the world of 
retirement planning, the “worst” is that we live forever. You may have heard 
people say, “I want to live long enough (or have my money last long enough) 
that my check for my funeral bounces.” Whereas many individual investors 
want to leave something for their children, grandchildren, and charity, the 
principle of having exactly enough for what you want for the exact amount of

old is really expected to live.

21
time that you will live holds true in a case of an investor picking the perfect 
asset allocation.
Because it is almost impossible to predict the exact date someone will write a 
check for their own funeral, however, the most practical alternative is to invest 
your assets as though that day will never come. Spending some of the value in 
a retirement account over time is fine, but you cannot draw down a great deal 
of it and still expect to have enough to last. A general rule of thumb is to plan 
to spend about 5% of your assets each year in retirement, but, like any rule of 
thumb, it may not be perfectly applicable to all people. If you have a 4% gain in 
your investments in a given year and inflation is 2%, then spending 5% results 
in a decrease of 3% in the value of your assets after inflation. If you retire very 
young (lucky you), that 3% annual decline may be too much to bear because 
your assets could run out before you do. If you retire at 80, a more generous 
spending plan may be in order.
Table 2-2 demonstrates how quickly assets can disappear if you spend too 
aggressively.

Table 2-2 imagines a hypothetical retiree who starts with $1 million in savings. 
We assume that the portfolio is invested after retirement in a fixed income-
heavy portfolio that earns 4% per year. Whereas a spending rate of $50,000 
per year, increasing by 2% per year for inflation, maintains some value of sav-
ings past age 90, the higher spending rates of $75,000 or $100,000 per year 
will deplete the entire retirement account in 10 to 15 years. If this individual 
has a reasonably long life expectancy, is married to a younger spouse who 
plans to live off this portfolio, or wishes to leave something for his or her chil-
dren and grandchildren, some adjustments must be made. The three options 
available are that the retiree must save more while he or she can, retire later, 
or plan to spend less in retirement. If we are realistic today about what spend-
ing limits we have in retirement, we can make those adjustments to our plan 
sufficiently far enough ahead of the game to change the outcome.
Be a Long-Term Investor
What all of this means is that you, just like institutional investors, must think 
and act with the long term in mind. Pension plans design their asset allocation 
with their eye on at least the next ten years, not current market trends. As 
a result, the first steps that you need to take include figuring out how much 
growth you need in your assets and how much risk you are willing to bear.  
In most cases, someone at 35 should be far more aggressive than someone 
at 70, but circumstances might be different for different individuals. There 
may be the occasional 35-year-old with a huge trust fund that needs to be 
protected, and conservatism is the right solution. There may also be the occa-
sional 70-year-old who has $100,000,000 from the sale of his company and 
only needs a very small fraction of that wealth to live. Unlike the normal 
70-year-old who is concerned with finding income-generating assets to pro-
vide safety in retirement, he can afford to invest 100% in stocks with the goal 
of creating a huge estate for his children.
Whatever your investment goal and long-term plan is, it should be created 
with a clear head and mind. If at all possible, engage the services of an accoun-
tant or planner at least for this part of your retirement plan. I’ll discuss how 
to utilize this kind of external advice this later in this chapter.
After you have picked the retirement plan that best suits you and your needs 
comes the hardest part: You have to stick with it. Make sure that whatever 
plan you come up with is a plan that you like and can afford to stick with. A 
plan you will want to change in six months is a recipe for disaster, not riches.
Pension plans typically review and, if necessary, change their asset allocations 
every three to five years. In the interim, they normally leave it alone, despite up 
markets or down markets. They also rebalance their assets back to that target 
on a very regular basis, especially when the investments move away from their 
proportionate targets by more than a few percentage points.

23
I said earlier this is the “hardest part” because humans are tempted to second-
guess themselves. When stocks outperform bonds, it can be terribly hard to 
stay the course and rebalance back to your target asset allocation, selling part 
of those terrific-performing stock funds to buy more of the bond funds that 
seem to be treading water. Every time you see a friend who made a boat-
load of money on a stock and bought a new car with the proceeds, you may 
second-guess your plan that tells you to sell every time those stocks go up to 
buy more of the stable (or boring) bond funds.
On the other side, in a market correction, when stocks fall 30% or 40% in 
only a few months, it can be incredibly painful to sell relatively stable fixed 
income investments and buy stocks to get back to target, only to see stocks 
fall another 10% or more as the “bear” market continues. It feels like you 
are throwing good money down an endless hole: right up to the point that 
it works and you find yourself rebalancing into stocks and other risky assets 
when the market finally begins to recover.
Every cycle eventually ends, and every market correction finds a bottom. 
When the trend ends, the reversal can be quick and violent. Following the 
October 2007 to March 2009 market decline, when most equity markets 
fell by 45% to 50%, stocks rose 30% in a matter of weeks after bottoming 
on March 9, 2009. Investors who had run for the hills and “capitulated” near 
the bottom, throwing in the towel after months and months of bad news and 
moving their assets to cash or bonds, missed that recovery. Sure, they could 
reinvest once they felt like things were back on track, but because they rode 
their stock investments all the way down and then gave up in early 2009 and 
moved to other types of assets, the fact that they missed that initial 30% 
recovery will cost them forever. When an individual who missed that initial 
recovery retires, this could mean the difference between retiring with $3  
million in total assets and $4 million.
In the spirit of full disclosure, even institutional investors fall into this trap. 
By the middle part of the last decade, a hospital company had made many 
capital improvements over the years and had taken out loans to pay for the 
improvements. As collateral for the loans, the hospital pledged the portfolio 
for their foundation. Some of the loans had covenants attached that mandated 
a minimum value of the hospital’s charitable foundation (the bank wanted to 
protect its collateral) and gave the bank the option of demanding full payment 
on the loans in the event the value of the foundation declined too much. As 
the markets fell and fell in 2007–2009, the foundation value began to approach 
the levels at which these covenants would be triggered. As a defensive move, 
the hospital company sold large portions of its stock portfolio and moved the 
assets into money market funds, thus protecting a floor value of the assets. In 
all fairness, the foundation trustees never really wanted to throw in the towel 
like that, but the bank that held their debt really forced them into a corner. 
This decision to de-risk after the market decline was driven more by that 

Chapter 2 | Asset Allocation
24
external pressure than by a fear amongst the trustees that markets would 
never recover. However, the end result was the same as if they had merely 
decided to reduce equity risk at the wrong time. I’m not exaggerating when 
I say that they mistimed the market almost exactly perfectly. Four days after 
they sent the orders to their external money managers to start selling on 
March 5, 2009, the stock market hit the bottom. The next two weeks saw an 
increase of almost 15%. In the interest of protecting its principal in the event 
this nascent recovery was not for real, the hospital waited several months 
before fully investing back to its long-term target, missing a 40% recovery on 
its assets in the process.
That 40% missed opportunity will reduce the hospital’s ability to conduct 
research and make other capital improvements forever. In a competitive mar-
ket for health care, the hospital has had to tighten its belt and lean more 
heavily than ever on charitable donors to recover its asset levels and avoid 
being left farther behind its peers who were able to remain fully invested 
throughout the market cycle.
Is a Three to Five Year Review Cycle for Asset 
Allocation Always Appropriate?
Are there any exceptions to the rule of standing by your targets without fail? 
Yes, as seen in the example of the health care company previously, there are 
circumstances in which you might need to revisit your asset allocation before 
the full three to five year planning period has elapsed.
To determine the right time to take a fresh look at their asset allocation plan, 
pension plans, endowments, and other institutional investors normally use 
the general rule of every three years or whenever circumstances significantly 
change, whichever comes first. If a corporation buys another company and 
merges the two entities’ pension plans together; a pension plan is frozen 
to new entrants (a common occurrence these days, sadly); the benefits are 
increased or reduced; the plan sponsor makes an extraordinary contribution 
into the plan; or anything else that renders moot the assumptions that were 
used at the time the target was developed, most pension plans will review 
their asset allocation mix before they reach that magic three-year anniversary. 
After all, the asset allocation mix selected was for a given liability in the pen-
sion plan and a given amount of assets that has now significantly changed.
Remember, though, upswings or downswings in the markets do not count as 
reasons to revisit the asset allocation plan. When the plan’s asset allocation 
targets were determined less than three years ago, some degree of volatility 
was anticipated. The long-term target that was chosen was one that the plan 
sponsor was comfortable with for all environments and for years into the 

Invest Like an Institution
25
future. An interim change before the three years is up should therefore always 
be due to a change in circumstances, not market values.
How does this translate to individual investors? The same logic applies: keep  
your plan for the duration of the target period unless the situation changes. 
What are allowable triggers for a change? The same as those for a pension 
plan:
1.	 Population change: The number of people in your plan 
changes (marriage, divorce, children are born, a deadbeat 
brother moves into the space above the garage).
2.	 Liability change: How much money you will need in 
retirement changes (you take or leave a job that offers 
a pension plan, thereby changing how much of your own 
savings you will need to live off of; you and your spouse 
decide to spend five years in the Peace Corps after retire-
ment, decreasing future cash needs for those years you 
are overseas).
3.	 Funding ability change: How much money you are able to 
contribute changes (you or your spouse get a large raise 
or pay cut, someone enters or leaves the workforce, and/
or there is a one-time contribution to your savings in the 
form of a severance package or inheritance).
The basic inputs into the calculation are simple, regardless of whether you are 
a $100 billion pension plan or an individual just starting a career. How much 
do you need at retirement? How much can you expect to earn on what you 
have already saved? How much can you save each year? When—and only 
when—one of these circumstances changes significantly can an interim target 
change be made to the long-term targets. When one of these triggers does 
hit, though, you should reset the three-year clock. Take a fresh look at your 
circumstances just like you did the first time around and work from a blank 
sheet of paper to design a plan that fits you today. Then put it aside and spend 
the next three years implementing that new plan before you examine it thor-
oughly again.
How Early You Start Determines How Much 
Your Assets Can Grow
Imagine five people who start investing at different ages, all with the common 
goal of retiring at 65 years old. Due to differing life events and circumstances, 
each is able to start investing at a different age and can contribute a different 

Chapter 2 | Asset Allocation
26
amount each year. For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that all have the 
same asset allocation and money managers and will earn 7.0% per year.5
Our first individual investor, John, has been unable to save for most of his life. 
With kids, a homemaker wife, troubles at work, and a boat, John was not able 
to start consistently saving until he reached age 50. He has $50,000 in the bank, 
which he converts into investments, and then takes the $10,000 he is no longer 
paying in college tuition, as his last child has just graduated, and plows them into 
his portfolio. At age 60, he realizes that he may not have enough to retire, cuts 
his spending to the bone, and increases contributions to $25,000 per year.
Second, Leslie and her husband are able to save a little earlier. At age 40, with 
$25,000 previously saved, Leslie gets a promotion and a raise, which enables 
them to begin to save $10,000 per year. When Leslie turns 47, her only child 
enters college, and she and her husband take a four-year break from making 
contributions, deciding to start contributing again when Leslie is 51. Like with 
John, after tuition payments (and soccer uniforms and dance classes) are over, 
Leslie and her husband increase their annual contributions to $15,000 each 
year until they turn 65.
Mark completes college at 24 (the best six or seven years of his life) and 
starts contributing $2,500 the next year to a savings plan. On his 30th and 
40th birthdays, he celebrates by increasing the annual contribution to $5,000 
and $7,500, respectively. From 45 to 52, Mark’s kids are in college and he, too, 
makes no contributions. With the last graduation, contributions increase to 
$10,000 until age 65.
Julie’s parents decide when she is born to set her off on the right track, so they 
contribute $2,000 per year into an IRA in her name. As she gets older, income 
from summer jobs and babysitting replaces Mom and Dad’s contribution. On 
graduation from college at 22, she resumes the $2,000 contributions after a 
four-year break while she was in school. At 25, to keep this simple, she matches 
the plan laid out for Mark that increases savings at each major birthday.
In addition to our four hypothetical individuals, in Table 2-3 I have also shown 
the results for “Julie Jr.” Julie Jr. is Julie’s alter ego who invests in precisely the 
same pattern as Julie, but who is lucky enough to work for a company from 
ages 22 to 65 that offers a match on retirement contributions of $0.50 per 
dollar,6  up to a maximum of $3,000 per year.7
5For the mathematicians out there who want to replicate my calculations, I will assume 
that the annual contributions occur on June 30, and therefore earn one-half of a year’s 
worth of investment gains in the remaining six months of the year.
6This assumes the match starts at age 22.
7According to Vanguard’s 2012 “How America Saves” report, 91% of all American companies 
offer a match. If your company does not, you can see in Table 2-3 how the impact on your 
retirement savings might be sufficient to make you seek one that does, even for lower pay.

Take a look first at the amounts contributed by each individual. They really 
aren’t that different, ranging from a total of $260,000 to $305,000, yet the end 
results vary by a factor of 6 (or even a factor of 7, if you include the benefit 
of finding an employer with a moderate match). Taking two of these individu-
als as an example, over a lifetime, John and Mark have contributed almost the 
same amount. However, despite the far larger amounts plowed into savings by 
John later in life when he can afford to do so, he simply cannot overcome the 
tremendous advantage that Mark gained by investing smaller amounts earlier 
in life, which resulted in a total asset level more than twice as large as John’s.
If I still haven’t convinced you of the advantage of investing as early as you can, 
here are two more examples: If Julie had not stopped making $2,000 annual 
contributions during college, her final value would have been $3,022,286, 
which amounts to $206,539 more at retirement just for making a total of 
$8,000 more in contributions. If Mark had been able to make even a $2,500 
contribution during the seven years his kids were in college, that $17,500 total 
would have meant a retirement value that was $66,106 higher.
“But I’m already 46!” you say. “I have had a lot of fun, but saved nothing. What 
do I do now?”
I am sorry to have to tell you this, but according to Einstein’s theories, time 
travel is not possible. Unfortunately, if you have been unable or unwilling to 
commit to a plan until now, you cannot go back and make up for 20 years’ 
worth of missed contributions, obviously.
What you can do, though, is start now. In addition to determining that time 
travel isn't possible, Albert Einstein once said that the most powerful force 
in the universe in compound interest—a contention that is clearly demon-
strated by Table 2-3, which shows vast differences in ending asset values as 
a result of the amount of time interest was allowed to compound. With our 
previous sample investors, John contributed more per year than did Leslie, 
but he ended up with about half her assets at retirement. If you are 46 already, 
start now, and front-load as much as you can. Don’t wait until you are 50 to 
really start “socking it away.” Those four years can be incredibly meaningful!
As an example, if you start saving $10,000 per year at 46, you would have 
$507,000 by 65. If you wait just two years to read this book, think it over, 
develop a plan, and write the first check, your savings at 65 would only be

$424,000. Two years of delays and $20,000 in lower contributions results in 
an ultimate difference of $83,000 at retirement.
Time is NOT on your side. If you wait just two more years until you are 50 to 
start saving, the $40,000 of foregone contributions and four years of missed 
returns results in a retirement value of $352,000, $155,000 less than if you 
just started now at age 46.
What on Earth Does This Have to Do with 
Pension Plans?
I know, this book is supposed to be about the lessons we can learn from pen-
sion plans, not simply a rehashing of the classes we took in high school math 
on the benefits of compound interest. So, how is this relevant?
It’s simple: Very generally speaking, many of the pension plans that have had 
trouble or failed over the last decade did not have the savings discipline of 
any of the individuals discussed previously. Many plans benefited from the 
outstanding market performance of the 1990s and, due to a combination of 
income statement padding and some arcane and shortsighted IRS rules that 
prevented corporate plans from making normal contributions when they 
reached certain “overfunded” levels, they stopped making contributions into 
their plans. When the Internet bubble burst in 2001, many plans had not made 
a contribution in several years and had not built up sufficient assets to ride 
out the market downturn. Had they chosen to (or been allowed to) continue 
to contribute each year in a conservative manner, the potentially greater “sur-
plus” in such plans by 1999 would have meant much more of a cushion as the 
stock market plunged.
As we have seen, the markets will rise and the markets will fall. What is 
important is for investors to maintain their discipline of investing and contrib-
uting to their retirement assets, despite the external market.
The other reason that pension plans failed to meet their targets is due to 
another lack of discipline: spending discipline. Many plans, especially public 
pension plans, that did continue to contribute throughout the 1990s8 often 
converted their paper “surpluses” into higher benefits for plan members with-
out a corresponding increase in contributions to make up for what was essen-
tially a retroactive increase in costs. That asset “surplus” wasn’t intended to 
be spent but to be saved for a rainy day.
8Public pension plans are driven by a different set of rules than are corporate plans (ahhhhh, 
the benefits of being a nontaxable entity and avoiding IRS rules) and therefore were able 
(required, in many cases) to continue to contribute throughout the 1990s, despite the fact 
that their funding statuses appeared to be quite solid.

For individual investors, this example again demonstrates the value of sticking 
to plans. If your ultimate goal is to retire to a small house on a golf course in 
Arizona, you will need $X in assets when you retire. If your goal is to buy a 
dive boat on Cozumel, you will need $Y. If your goal is to buy a winery in Napa, 
you will need $Z. Don’t get halfway to the target and then change your goal 
without making a corresponding change in your savings plans.
Although everyone has the right to change their minds over time, an individual 
needs to make sure that the plan changes when the end goal changes. Just 
because the markets are soaring and your $2,000 annual savings appears to 
be enough to buy the RV in 20 years, you need to be sure to build a sufficient 
“surplus” so that when the rainy day hits (and it will, as markets will periodi-
cally fall), the assets are sufficient to ride out the storm.
When Good Plans Go Bad
When times are good, it is very tempting for a pension plan to fall into this 
trap. If assets are ahead of where they need to be at a given point in time, it is 
far too easy for elected officials, trustees, or plan sponsors to reduce contri-
butions or raise benefits (often without making additional contributions). In 
practice, however, these changes simply cause the plan to spend its surplus.
As mentioned earlier, in the 1990s, many corporate plans were prevented 
from making any contributions into their plans at all due to their significantly 
overfunded statuses and the desire under tax laws to prevent corporations 
from shielding excess earnings from taxation by making “unnecessary” pension 
contributions. When asset levels in these plans fell with the market declines 
during the bursting of the NASDAQ bubble, many plans suddenly found them-
selves significantly underfunded, resulting in large “catch-up” contributions 
that haven’t yet done the job. Some companies were even forced into bank-
ruptcy or restructuring due to the enormous nature of the new contribution 
requirements. Had these companies been allowed to make steady annual con-
tributions, instead of being barred from contributing by the IRS, even when the 
contributions weren’t viewed as necessary, the additional “rainy day” savings 
would have helped them weather the storm that followed.
Two Different Approaches Toward Benefit Levels 
Results in Very Different Financial Situations
The following is a real-world example of two pension plans that took two 
very different approaches toward contribution and spending discipline. These 
two public pension plans are located in geographic regions that happen to 
neighbor each other in the same South Eastern state. Both have a similar 

Chapter 2 | Asset Allocation
30
amount of total assets, similar political leanings, and similar demographics.  
I refer to one fund as “Plan A” and the other as “Fund B.”
Despite significant pressure from various mayors and other city officials over 
the years, Plan A has not raised benefits for its members nor reduced con-
tribution rates in the pension plan since the early 1990s, choosing instead to 
provide additional defined-contribution plan benefits for employees who have 
long tenures with the system and have reached the maximum benefit under 
the pension plan. Despite the twin market declines in 2001–2003 and 2008, 
Plan A remains significantly overfunded today, with assets worth more than 
115% of the accrued pension liability.
Fund B, in contrast, has not been nearly so careful. During the 1990s, when 
returns were routinely 10% or better for several years in a row, the local 
board of elected officials made a few decisions that would impact the future 
health of the system.
First, as assets began piling up, the board decided to spend some of the plan’s 
excess returns. Every year that returns exceeded the expected rate of return 
(around 8%), half of the excess returns would be set aside into a special 
account that would be used to provide a supplemental benefit to retirees. 
When the retirees saw the assets growing well and placed pressure on the 
(elected) board to share some of that wealth, they were more than happy 
to accommodate them by providing the membership with that additional 
benefit.
Second, the board decided to spend some of the surplus for the community, 
too, by reducing the local authority’s9 required contribution into the plan when 
things were good. Whenever the annual return outperformed that same 8% 
hurdle, a quarter of the outperformance was set aside into an account that 
would be used to offset the required contribution—in other words, whenever 
returns were better than expected, not only did the required contribution fall 
(because the above-expectation growth in assets helped to close the under-
funded gap), but the above-average gains were used to offset even more of 
the community’s contribution into the plan. On the other hand, if the fund 
underperformed the 8% target in a year, that was it: no extra contribution or 
no return of any funds from those two set-aside accounts.
This may be getting a little confusing, so I will stop to sum up the situation 
for anyone who didn’t follow what was going on. If the fund returned 8% in 
a year (the expected return for any given year, which is used to calculate the 
present value of the liability), all was well. The assets grew 8%, the liability 
was assumed to grow 8%, and all was good in the world. If the assets grew 3%  
9For example, this could include the city, county, or state that funded the plan.

31
(a mediocre return) or fell 5% in a poor year, both of which were assumed 
to occur from time to time under a normal distribution of outcomes, a little 
bit of ground was lost in trying to keep up with liability growth, but that’s 
life. Some years are good and some are bad. Remember from the example of 
our individual investor, Bob, that remaining invested after a bad year lets your 
assets recover in a good year.
Here’s the problem: All those decisions the board made meant that there  
were no more “good” years. If the fund returned 16%, 8% better than 
expected, 4% (half the outperformance) would go to that supplemental  
benefit and 2% (another quarter of the outperformance) would reduce future 
contributions, leaving only a 10% return for the assets in the fund. In practice, 
therefore, every time the fund outperformed, most of the outperformance 
went somewhere else. Every time the fund underperformed, the loss was the 
pension fund’s to keep. How can anyone keep pace with that 8% expectation 
under these circumstances?
Third, in May 2003, luckily right at the bottom of the market, the community 
issued a Pension Obligation Bond. This is a public debt issuance where the 
proceeds from the bond sale are used to bring up the value of an underfunded 
pension, with bond service to be covered by future tax revenues. When rates 
are low, you tend to lock in a low financing rate, hopefully well below your 
expected return. However, tax increases, especially in a politically conservative 
area, are never really welcome. So, to keep people happy, the board coupled 
the bond issuance with a significant increase in benefits to future retirees, 
thereby negating much of the financial benefit of the “catch-up” from the 
proceeds of the bond because an increase in benefits means an increase in 
liabilities.
Fourth, in early 2007, the markets were in the midst of their fourth good year 
in a row. A new bubble was forming in real estate, but everything else was 
doing well, too. Few realized that the debt markets were about to come crash-
ing down. So, what did the board do? Well, because things were going so well 
over the last few years, they raised benefits again! Shortly thereafter, of course, 
we experienced the dual fun of the “Credit Crisis” and the “Great Recession,” 
leading most risky assets to fall in value by 50% or more.
Today, Fund B, the community fund that did not accumulate any rainy day 
surplus is now less than 70% funded. In other words, for every dollar it has 
promised to retirees in present value terms, the fund has less than 70 cents on 
hand. Plan A, thanks to its diligence and conservatism, has $1.15.
What lessons can we as individuals draw from this? Although the differences 
between these funds have impacts in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the 
behaviors exhibited by these two sets of professionals behind the funds are 

Chapter 2 | Asset Allocation
32
replicated every day by individual investors. On one hand, we have a group 
(Plan A) that is committed to a disciplined, austere, long-term plan and con-
tinues to maintain that conservative discipline and commitment to steady 
contributions through thick and through thin. On the other hand, we have a 
group (Fund B) that was less careful with its funds, deviated from its invest-
ment plan, raised benefits, decreased contributions, and ignored the long-term 
implications of doing so.
A personal investor that exemplifies the same behavior as Plan A would save 
every week or month up to the point that it started to hurt, and maybe 
even beyond that point—$1,000 per pay period, say. Every pay period without 
exception. This person would also have a clear goal in mind, maybe a modest 
retirement, and would stay focused on that plan like a laser.
Conversely, a personal investor that mimics Fund B would contribute $10,000 
one month and then skip four months to pay for a lavish vacation to reward 
himself for making that big contribution that first month. Then, after a month 
in which stocks happened to have a great run, the individual’s end goal would 
shift from a modest retirement to a castle in Tuscany with a winery, to which 
he makes a nonrefundable down payment equal to half his life’s savings, with 
his current house and cars pledged against some extra debt. After all, if stocks 
keep going up 5% a month forever, like they did for him last month, he will be 
a billionaire soon enough, and the debt doesn’t matter! Then, when stocks 
naturally fall in subsequent months, as they tend to do, he stops making savings 
contributions and takes out another loan against his wife’s 401(K) to service 
the debt on the Tuscan property, finding himself radically underfunded versus 
his financial goals and in need of large savings contributions just to tread 
water.
Sure, the second individual is a bit of an exaggeration. However, Figure 2-1 
illustrates that at least a little of this reckless behavior among individuals is 
fairly common.

Figure 2-1.  US Personal Savings Rate. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis—Federal Reserve 
Economic Data
As Figure 2-1 shows, the savings rate among individuals as a percentage of 
income was fairly level for a few years after the negative effects of the tech-
nology bubble began to wear off, and then, as the housing market and stock 
market really began to take off, people felt like they were wealthier due to 
their growing assets and believed that they needed to save less. In 2008, the 
financial crisis hit, and suddenly people felt poorer again. Investment balances 
and savings were down significantly, and people as a whole began to save more 
to make up the difference.
The point of all of this is that although we can bemoan the behavior of govern-
ments and plans like Fund B, which save less when times are good and then 
feel the need to raise contribution levels and taxes to pay for them when 
times are bad, we can see that the population is just as guilty of the exact 
same behavior—saving less than is needed and spending more than is prudent. 
I’m here to help you, as an individual investor, break that cycle in your own 
investment plan. Let’s keep our investment levels constant over time to take 
advantage of both good times and bad.

Dollar Cost Averaging
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Markets will go up and they will go down. 
Unless your Magic 8 Ball is way more accurate than mine, there really is no 
way to predict swings in price from month to month to month. If you wait to 
buy until you think prices have bottomed, you will probably miss the bottom. 
If you think prices are too high and hold off on buying more shares, you may 
very well be underinvested in the next bull market.
So, what is an individual investor to do in lieu of finding a mythical market 
price predictor? The best strategy is just to keep buying a given dollar amount 
periodically over time, no matter what—which is also known as “dollar cost 
averaging.” In fact, even if you could get your hands on a mythical market price 
predictor, dollar cost averaging is probably a better bet. Why? Believe it or not, 
using this strategy, you actually will end up purchasing your investments at a 
lower average price than you probably would have paid if you had some small 
ability to time the markets. Here is why: If you invest the same dollar amount 
every period, when prices are high, you buy fewer shares. When prices are 
low, you buy more shares. As a result, your weighted average buying price 
automatically falls below the average market price.
Here is an example. Mary invests $300 every month. She logs onto her bro-
kerage’s web site on the last day of the month and simply buys $300 worth of 
her favorite mutual fund. Over the next three months, the prices at which she 
transacts are $20, $15, and $25 (this is a very volatile fund).
Over those three months, the simple average market price is $20. But Mary 
doesn’t get exactly that average. In the first month, when the price is $20 per 
share, Mary buys 15 shares. At the end of the second month, the price is $15 
per share, and Mary buys 20 shares. At the end of the third month, the price 
is $25 per share, and Mary buys 12 shares. Overall, she has spent $900 for 47 
shares at an average price of $19.15. That is 85 cents per share better than 
the average price of $20 per share for that time period.
At this point, you are probably thinking that I spent all day long trying to find 
some combination of prices to make that example work out the way it did. 
Honestly, I didn’t. I just picked three prices out of thin air that I knew were 
evenly divisible into $300 per month.
Here is more proof. Table 2-4 shows month-ending prices for Microsoft10 
stock for each of the last 12 months up to the time of this writing, as well 
as the dollar cost averaged transaction schedule for an investor buying $500 
10I know, Microsoft is pretty “old school” as an example. I was going to be trendier and use 
Apple as an example, but given that my $500 would buy less than 1 share each month, the 
math wasn’t very exciting.

worth of the stock every month. To make this example fair, I’m assuming that 
the investor can buy fractional shares.11

11In reality, most investors cannot buy fractional shares of a stock like Microsoft. Rounding 
off to the nearest whole share each month might generate a different result. However, 
given that mutual funds trade in three-digit decimal share amounts, the math will hold for 
most investors in 401(k) plans or other accounts where they buy mutual funds. I also used 
decimal shares because my $500 amount was arbitrary. Someone saving $10,000 a month 
cares a lot less about decimals than someone saving $500 a month, and I don’t want the 
$500 amount to disprove the example.
Dollar cost averaging would have saved you $0.17 per share over just the past 
year. That comes to $35.30 for the 204 shares purchased, or a little more than 
one of those shares for free. Imagine if you dollar cost averaged your monthly 
purchases over a decade, or even over a career. Given enough time, the disci-
pline of steady contributions will really add up to some significant benefits.
Picking Your Asset Allocation
Now for the fun part. By now you understand the need for a disciplined com-
mitment to savings, and we are all agreed that we will pick a plan and stay with 
it through thick and thin, right?

Chapter 2 | Asset Allocation
36
Great!
What’s the plan?
It depends. The “right” asset allocation plan is defined as the one that is right 
for you. You need to sit down with your significant other(s) and determine 
what your retirement goals are. What are your current assets? How much 
can you afford to save? How much risk can you tolerate? These are the types 
of factors that will determine if a portfolio of 80% stocks and 20% bonds is 
right for your needs or if you are better off with 20% stocks and 80% bonds, 
or some other combination entirely.
Unfortunately, without sitting side by side with you and understanding your 
complete financial picture, I cannot tell you exactly what your asset allocation 
should be. What I can do is offer you guidance in where to get some direction 
to build your plan.
Assumptions
The first step that any pension plan takes in determining its asset allocation 
is to develop a set of assumptions for the expected return and risk of every 
asset class it is investing in or considering. In the same way, you need to first 
figure out what you expect your investment options will return. If your finan-
cial plan will require you to achieve a 6% return on average every year, does 
that mean you need to invest 100% or 40% in stocks?
Pension plans typically adopt these assumptions from their investment con-
sultants, enlist economists to help them determine their assumptions, or use 
internal macroeconomic models to develop their own assumptions. All of 
these custom solutions are probably unavailable to help you specifically. That 
doesn’t mean that you cannot use these resources to your advantage at all, 
however. For example, most public pension plans typically publish their assump-
tions online in their meeting agendas, meeting minutes, or annual reports.
If your local pension plan doesn’t publish its own assumptions, it would be 
pretty easy to check what the major plans—like CalPERS, CalSTRS, Florida 
Retirement System, Texas Teachers, and the rest—use in their models simply 
by referencing their meeting minutes or annual reports online. You could 
even survey a few to see if there is any consensus.
Another option would be to do some digging and check what the major 
investment banks and commercial banks are predicting. Although most  
macroeconomic research by banks is reserved for their major clients, you 
might be able to find a few sets of assumptions from some credible sources 
with a quick Google search. Typing “asset class assumptions” into a search 
engine just gave me a number of links to assumptions published by several 
investment management companies, consulting firms, and economics research 

Invest Like an Institution
37
organizations. If you don’t want to rely on any one particular source, you can 
also use the Wall Street Journal, which periodically publishes a survey of a large 
population of economists’ expected returns for stocks and bonds. It doesn’t 
cover all the other asset classes you might consider, but at least it gives you a 
general indication of overall expectations for some of the largest asset classes, 
like stocks and bonds.
Although in practice the math is a little more complicated, you now have at 
least a general guide as to what you should expect for returns from a given 
asset allocation mix. If you see a consensus that stocks are expected to return 
8% and bonds 4%, you know that a 50/50 mix of both might get you a return 
that is somewhere around 6%. I’m discounting the importance of correlations 
in returns among asset classes here, which is very important in calculating risk 
estimates, because we really do not expect to be exact for this kind of planning 
exercise. Your goal is to find a reasonable return expectation that you can use 
in your calculations of how much you need to save to get to your retirement 
savings target and how to get there. Ridiculous levels of precision are unneces-
sary, given that reality will never perfectly reflect your expectations anyway.
Developing Your Plan
The next step is to put all these pieces together and see if the plan fits the 
goals. 
Let’s say you just turned 48 years old; can afford to save, say, $1,500 per month; 
you expect to earn 6% per year; you have already saved $225,000; you have 
17 years until retirement; and you want to have $1.2 million in total savings at 
retirement to allow for $50,000 in annual postretirement income, you need to 
see if all these numbers add up into a credible plan that you can live with.
There are a lot of resources out there to help you build and test your plan.
The easiest to use, in my opinion, are the retirement planning tools on the 
web sites of most commercial banks, brokerages, and mutual fund companies—
especially the companies that tend to provide 401(k) services. These web 
sites typically have a bunch of blanks that you can fill in with data—like how 
much you have saved, how much can you save, and how much you expect to 
earn—and then will give you an estimate of whether your retirement goal is 
realistic or not. Most of them now have “sliders” where you can easily adjust 
the assumptions in these models with your mouse and immediately see the 
long-term benefit of saving an extra $100 a month or deferring your retire-
ment from 65 to 68.
The results that you get from these web sites are often quite eye-opening, 
and I recommend that anyone who seriously wants to plan for their future 
play with one of these for at least a few minutes. Socking away a mere $200 
a month from your paycheck for your entire career may very well leave you 

Chapter 2 | Asset Allocation

broke after four years of retirement. Retiring with a balance of $1 million 
sounds like a huge amount of money today, until you realize that if you spend 
$75,000 of that balance every year, the money won’t last forever. Be as conser-
vative as you dare on your return expectations and as aggressive as you can 
be on the amount you think you will need at retirement. It is always better to 
err on the side of too much money at retirement than too little.
After you think you have a plan, show it to someone else. Your spouse might 
take one look at it and declare that your return expectation is unrealistic, or 
that the savings number is impossible, or maybe even that you can save more 
if the family makes certain sacrifices to increase your chances of reaching  
your goals.
Then, if you can, show it to an expert. Most commercial bank branches and 
some discount brokerage branches employ on-site professionals who can help 
with retirement planning, and they often do so for free if you have an account 
with the company. Typically these experts will invite you to walk through 
retirement-specific software programs, like the online sliders I mentioned, 
with them to help you get a better understanding of your needs. Like your 
spouse, an expert might help you find the flaws or unrealistic expectations in 
your plan so that you can avoid an unpleasant surprise later. These experts 
may also help you find better ways to build your plan by, for example, add-
ing other asset classes or types of investments that you had not considered. 
Although I will discuss in Chapter 9 on fees and expenses how to make sure 
that you are not taken for a ride, listen to the advice for now and see if you 
think it is intended to benefit you or the bank. If it really helps your plan, this 
meeting could have been a great use of your time.
If All Else Fails, Trust the Experts
So the sliders on your company’s 401(k) web site told you one thing, and the 
IRA guy at your local branch told you the exact opposite. You think that you 
can get 7% per year, and your spouse thinks you are crazy to be so optimistic. 
What are you to do?
There are two more sources of information or ideas that might help you to 
confirm or disprove your approach.
First, I previously suggested using the asset class return and risk assump-
tions from a large pension plan as a starting point. Why not use their target 
asset allocation, too? Unless you are very close to retirement, you should have 
a long-term focus in mind, just like the pension plan does. After much consul-
tation with experts, the city pension plan or your state’s pension plan might 
have changed its asset allocation to a new mix of X% stocks, Y% bonds, and 
Z% alternatives, resulting in an expected return of 7.2% per year. Although 
that might not be an exact match for your situation, it is one very credible 

Invest Like an Institution
39
determination of what a long-term plan should look like and how much it 
should earn per year. It will also provide a great starting point for your own 
work or a confirmation of your own estimates.
Second, target-date funds, which are mutual funds that invest in a wide vari-
ety of asset classes—including stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash, among 
others—can provide some great information about how experts are looking 
at asset allocation. These funds are offered by almost 200 mutual fund com-
panies and are frequently included in 401(k) plans as an investment option, 
sometimes even the default option.
Target-date funds typically are offered in an investment family that includes 
a variety of retirement dates, each with a different asset allocation mix that 
changes over time, and incorporate an expected retirement year in the 
name of the fund. For example, a given mutual fund company might offer the 
TargetDate 2040 fund, intended for people who will be turning 65 within a 
few years of the year 2040. This fund today (in 2013) will be predominantly 
invested in stocks and other risky assets because people who buy this fund 
are expected to have more than 25 years until retirement. The TargetDate 
2015 fund, in contrast, might be far more conservative, with large investments 
in bonds and other lower risk assets because participants in this fund are 
expected to be very close to retirement. Over the next 25 years, the portfo-
lio manager for the 2040 fund will slowly change the asset allocation to one 
with a lower risk as the participants get closer to retirement; and the fund 
company will add 2050, 2055, 2060, 2065, and 2070 funds to its lineup as new 
workers enter the workforce in the decades to come.
Given that each of these companies publishes the underlying asset allocation 
mix in their prospectuses, on their web sites, and on industry web sites like 
Morningstar.com, a person who expects to retire in 2035 could look up the 
asset allocation for the 2035 funds offered by several mutual fund companies 
to see how closely the average asset allocation fits the plan that she or he has 
come up with. Alternatively, the individual could just invest in that target-date 
fund and call it quits. In a perfect world, the fund that matches the individual’s 
expected retirement year has an appropriate asset allocation for an average 
person of the same age, eliminates many of the investment structure risks 
and complexities that I outline in Chapters 3 through 6, and takes care of the 
selection of the underlying investment funds on behalf of the investor. Frankly, 
individuals could put 100% of their assets into one of these funds, spend all 
their spare time thinking about how to come up with extra contributions to 
their savings, and use the rest of this book as a doorstop if they really wanted 
to. That is, after all, the entire reason target-date funds were created in the 
first place. They serve as one-stop solutions for people who don’t have the 
time, knowledge, resources, interest, or confidence to make their own invest-
ment decisions and want someone to hand them a solution that does all the 
work for them. This doesn’t mean that target-date funds are perfect, but they 

Chapter 2 | Asset Allocation
40
very well might be good enough for people who don’t have the time, knowl-
edge, or resources to do better. Target-date funds often will charge higher 
fees for the total portfolio than an individual could find on his or her own 
by building his or her own portfolio, especially if an individual makes liberal 
use of index funds. Nevertheless, that incremental cost may be worth it for 
the peace of mind that these funds provide to their participants about their 
asset allocation. Be aware, however, that target-date funds are designed for a 
generic investor of a given age. Because every investor has a unique risk toler-
ance, time frame, and asset value, the asset allocation that might work for one 
individual, or for the generic 32-year-old investor, may not be a perfect fit with 
every potential client.
Summary
If you take nothing else from this book, understand that a disciplined approach 
to making continuous contributions into a portfolio with an appropriate level 
of risk is the single most successful way to achieve your financial goals.
When you are ahead of plan after a bull market, stay on plan. Keep contributing. 
Don’t take a rest and trust that you are done. When the market falls in value, 
don’t panic. Save more if you can, sure, but do not make radical changes to 
your plan that prevent your assets from recovering over time, assuming you 
have time to recover. Most important, be realistic and be conservative. Be 
realistic and conservative in how you think you need and want to live after 
retirement to make sure that you save enough to get there. Be realistic and 
conservative about your annual return expectation. Be realistic and conser-
vative about how much you can contribute, erring on the side of too many 
contributions whenever it is possible to do so.
Whereas you have a lifetime to save and invest, you only turn 65 once, and 
you only get the results of one retirement plan when you do. If your asset 
balance at retirement isn’t exactly what you and your planner projected when 
you were 28, would you rather discover that you will retire with too much 
money or too little? Oversaving and outperforming your return expectations 
will likely lead to a far more comfortable retirement than would be the case 
if the chips do not fall in your favor. By picking a conservative asset allocation 
that is right for you, coupled with a disciplined plan of aggressive contribu-
tions, you can greatly increase your chances of building a retirement reserve 
sufficient to your needs.

Basic Domestic Equity Considerations
In Chapter 2, I discussed the importance of selecting an asset allocation 
plan that is appropriate to your needs. Now that you have determined what 
percentage of your assets should be invested in stocks, the next step is to deter-
mine how those equity investments should be structured. Studies have shown 
that if asset allocation drives 90% of the returns of a total portfolio, structure 
decisions, the next part of our arrow-shaped Road Map to Financial Success, 
determine more than 5% of the results. In this chapter and the one after it,  
I will guide you through the major considerations that both pension plans and 
individual investors face when it comes to constructing an equity portfolio.

When they are tasked with buying individual stocks or mutual funds that invest 
in stocks, many investors get too caught up in chasing the latest trends, like 
investing in growth stocks after a technology boom has dominated the market 
for years or entering a foreign market based on recent results. However, these 
types of decisions do little to improve an investor’s long-term results because 
chasing yesterday’s trend is never a safe investment and often will dramatically 
increase the level of risk in his or her portfolio. That's why, in this chapter, 
I will discuss some basic elements of each of the many types of biases that 
investors fall prey to when constructing their portfolios and demonstrate why 
most pension plans avoid them and their resultant risks wherever they can. 
In addition, I will review the merits or unnecessary risks that come from an 
overreliance on only growth or value investing, or on an imbalance to large 
cap, mid cap, or small cap stocks (an explanation of what these mean will 
follow for the uninitiated). I will start, however, with the most fundamental 
debate that every investor must wrestle with—whether to invest actively or 
passively.
Active versus Passive Investing
If you want to invest in the stock market index simply to reap the gains of the 
overall market returns year after year, you are, by definition, a passive inves-
tor. A variety of money management companies offer index funds, or mutual 
fund products that simply buy shares in every company in a given index (the 
S&P 500 is the most common example) in the proportions in which they are 
weighted in the index. Let’s say that Apple Computer and ExxonMobil each 
comprised about 4% of the benchmark and Microsoft comprised about 2%. 
An index fund manager who has invested $10 billion of aggregated client 
money would therefore hold $400 million each of Apple and ExxonMobil 
stock, $200 million worth of Microsoft stock, and $9 billion in the other 497 
companies in the S&P 500 in proportions that are determined by the index 
publisher and roughly equate to the relative size of the outstanding market 
capitalization (the total value of a company's stock) of each company.
As client money is added to or removed from the index fund, adjustments are 
made to make sure that as close to a perfect match as possible is made with 
the index constitution. If Apple grows to comprise 5% of the index, the exist-
ing positions will have grown in value correspondingly. As a result, any new 
cash that is invested in the index fund will now be 5% invested in Apple and 
1% less in something else (most likely a very small amount less spread across 
most of the other 499 companies in the index).
Indexed mutual funds and exchange traded funds (essentially mutual funds 
that trade throughout the day like individual stocks and often carry slightly 
lower fees than mutual funds that use similar strategies) are among the cheap-
est ways to invest in stocks, thanks to fierce competition among mutual fund

managers, which has brought the cost of these vehicles down dramatically 
over the last decade. To demonstrate how easy it can be to run an index 
fund, and therefore how little it should cost the individual investor, one state 
pension plan that I used to work with employed one single worker to man-
age a 500 million dollar S&P 500 index fund. This employee was tasked with 
tracking the plan’s holdings in an Excel spreadsheet, comparing these hold-
ings with the published weights in the index on a daily basis, and trading the 
portfolio when necessary to rebalance back to target weights—as a part-time 
job! Index funds require no stock analysts to develop forecasts for earnings 
or growth prospects for companies because they make no decisions about 
adding or deleting stocks based on the perceived merits of each company as 
an investment. As much as the portfolio manager may love or hate a stock, if 
S&P says that XYZ Corporation comprises 0.32% of the S&P 500 index, the 
index fund manager will attempt to hold precisely 0.32% of his assets in shares 
of that company without any independent judgment. If the S&P 500 index 
returns 4.23% in a given month, a fund that is intended to track that index as 
closely as possible will return for its clients very close to that same 4.23%, less 
some minor deviations for small misweights, client cash flows, recent dividend 
payments, and the fees that the manager charges the investors.
On the other side of the spectrum are actively managed mutual funds and 
other investment products. In these funds, a portfolio manager (or, in some 
cases, a group of portfolio managers and/or analysts) will decide which compa-
nies to buy and sell whenever they deem it appropriate. Teams of analysts for 
the money management company will spend their days talking to customers, 
competitors, and suppliers, trying to determine which companies will have bet-
ter returns than their peers in the near future. The portfolio manager and his 
team will crisscross the country, visiting factories and meeting with CEOs to 
try to determine firsthand which are the best investment opportunities. Then, 
the portfolio manager might build a portfolio with investments in his favorite, 
say, 75 of the companies in the S&P 500, leaving out the other 425 companies. 
Every day, small adjustments will be made to the portfolios, with new com-
panies being added or old companies being sold completely every few weeks 
or months. Over the course of a year, a typical actively managed mutual fund 
might buy and sell 50% to 150% of the portfolio, holding any individual position 
anywhere from a few months to a few years. As a result, rather than returning 
the results of the S&P 500 stock index when it is up 4.23% in that same month, 
the hypothetical portfolio manager mentioned previously will return the sum 
of his 75 company subset. If the active manager is up 7% or down 3% in the 
same month that the index is up 4.23%, his disassociation from the benchmark 
would be completely expected, given that the manager is not trying to replicate 
the index returns. Instead, the active manager is trying to add value from the 
selection of superior stock investments above the benchmark as consistently 
as possible so that over longer periods of time, clients earn a better rate of 
return than they would have received in the index fund.

Chapter 3 | Investment Structure for Stocks, Part I
44
That better rate of return is, of course, the goal of the actively managed fund, 
not a promise. Keep in mind that the sum of the returns of all investors in 
the stocks of the S&P 500 index is basically equal to the market return, less 
transaction costs and investment manager fees. Let's say that we are both 
portfolio managers and I like IBM and you don’t, so I buy it and you don’t. 
You like GM and I don’t, so you buy it and I don’t. At the end of the day, our 
individual portfolios, and the portfolios of all of our peers, all the investment 
managers in the world, and all the mutual funds, will add up to have roughly 
the same performance as the overall index, less our average management 
fee. As a result, in aggregate, all investors in those stocks will earn the S&P 
500 return, less transaction costs (the costs of trading, like commissions, 
market impacts, etc.) and any fees that the investment managers charge to 
their clients.
Choosing an active manager is, therefore, never a guarantee that you will 
outperform the benchmark. In fact, the vast majority of large cap core mutual 
funds (those that would be measured against the S&P 500) have a rather hard 
time consistently beating the benchmark.
Take a look at Figure  3-1, which plots the returns of 992 large cap core 
mutual funds against the S&P 500 index on a rolling three-year basis back to 
December 1989. Every point on this chart indicates how the returns of the 
S&P 500 for the preceding three years compared to the entire opportunity 
set (commonly referred to as the “universe”) of large cap core mutual funds at 
that point in time. For example, the cluster of dots in the valley around 2002 
indicate that for the three years ending on December 31, 2002 (December 31,  
2000, to December 31, 2002), you would have been quite happy investing in 
actively managed funds because the index falls on the vertical scale around  
the 90 mark, indicating that about 90% of large cap core investment managers 
were outperforming the S&P 500 on a medium-term basis.

45
In contrast, in August 1996, the dots peak at around 10%, indicating that only 
10% of large cap core mutual funds had better three-year returns than the 
S&P 500 index. In other words, 90% of large cap core mutual funds underper-
formed the index for the 1994–1996 period.
Since 2002, the index has made steady gains against the universe of actively 
managed funds, with roughly median performance from 2003 to 2008 (half of the 
mutual funds outperformed the index, half of the mutual funds underperformed). 
Most recently, the index ranked around 20%, meaning that approximately 90% of 
large cap core mutual funds have underperformed the S&P 500.
Over the entire history of Figure 3-1, you can see that the index has generally 
remained in the top half, with two short exceptions around 1994 and 2002. 
This means that there has been generally a better than 50–50 chance that any 
fund you pick will underperform the benchmark. In some periods, as I have 
previously mentioned, the odds of picking a “losing” fund have been between 
80% to 90%.
I will discuss manager selection (how to actually go about picking investment 
managers) in Chapter 7, but, until then, understand that the deck in large cap 
core investing has been largely stacked against you!
Is this effect limited to only large cap core stocks? Let’s take a look at large 
cap value managers.

The 600 large cap value mutual funds in Figure 3-2 tell a similar story to that 
which was told in Figure 3-1. Although there have been periods of decent 
relative manager performance over the course of the past 20 years, there is 
clear evidence that investing in large cap value mutual funds is a tough slog. 
From December 1989 until late 2008, the Wilshire Large Cap Value Index has 
pretty consistently ranked above the median manager, again indicating that 
more than half (and, again, at times as many as 90%) of managers have under-
performed the benchmark.

The 2008–2010 Credit Crisis and the resulting recession was really the only 
exception to this rule, as evidenced by the extended period of below-median 
ranks by the index in Figure 3-2. Based on my personal observations, many 
managers became very conservative in their approaches to the market and 
their willingness to take risk during this time period. When clients began 
to withdraw money during the worst of the crisis, many investment manag-
ers raised more cash than was needed to protect themselves from future 
redemptions. Given how hard it was for managers to find any liquidity whatso-
ever in the market, many raised cash every time they got the chance. When a 
market is falling, holding 10% of your assets in cash instead of stocks can pro-
vide a great buffer against losses and make you look very good by comparison 
because only 90% of your portfolio continues to fall day after day, while the 
index sees 100% of its exposure remain in falling stock prices.

In March 2009, global stock markets bottomed and began a rapid recovery. 
Those managers who still had cash on their balance sheets instead of 100% 
stocks now saw that cash act like an anchor in a strong current, holding them 
back from going with the flow. The index had an almost vertical improvement 
relative to the universe, especially in 2011.
The evidence in Figure 3-2 about the performance of large cap value managers 
therefore indicates to me that the large cap core chart was not an anomaly; 
large cap investing in general is a difficult thing to do properly. There are liter-
ally thousands of analysts at Wall Street banks, money managers, and hedge 
funds—plus potentially tens of thousands of individual investors—looking at, 
for example, General Electric (or any other large cap company) every single 
day. The odds that the majority of them have superior information to the 
few others and can act on that information in a legal manner that provides 
superior returns to the population as a whole are very slim. Although there 
are certainly some large cap core and value managers that can provide consis-
tently superior performance, as we will discuss in the chapter on investment 
manager selection, Chapter 7, finding them is a hard task.
Figure 3-3, which shows the distribution of returns of 351 small cap core 
mutual funds plotted against the Russell 2000 index, tells a slightly different 
story than Figures 3-1 and 3-2 did. Small cap investing is characterized by less 
information widely available to investors, fewer investment analysts poring 
over the same data, and, as will be discussed later in this chapter, widespread 
“cheating” by small cap managers (buying microcap or midcap stocks that are 
not contained in the benchmark).

From 1989 to about 2005, Figure 3-3 is almost an exact copy of the large cap 
core and large cap value charts, with extended periods of outperformance 
by the population of managers above the benchmark. In 2002, for example, 
more than 90% of small cap managers were outperforming the benchmark.  
The last five years, however, have seen more of a mixed bag, with the index 
oscillating from the 50th percentile to the top 25%, and most recently it has 
been hovering right around the median. I wouldn’t say that Figure 3-3 is conclusive 
because the index does bounce around quite a bit, but you could certainly 
make the case that there is a better chance that you might pick an investment 
manager capable of outperformance when you select small cap active managers  
than there is for some of the large cap categories discussed previously. 
Although there is still plenty of opportunity for underperformance, this is an 
asset class in which the evidence at least begins to support the premise that 
you could find consistent outperformance in small cap core investing. This 
is the main reason why pension plans that tend to index most or all of their 
large cap allocations will hire active managers for small cap stocks—greater 
evidence that small cap stock managers might add some consistent value to 
their portfolios.
In Chapter 4, I will discuss the benefits of investing in a global portfolio for 
stocks, rather than investing in a predominantly domestic portfolio, as many 
investors tend to do. For now, Figure 3-4 clearly supports the premise that 
markets and capital are becoming more global. Whereas the 671 managers 
who invest in developed markets (generally, the first-world economies) out-
side the United States experienced some wild volatility relative to the index 
in the 1990s,1 the path since has shown a smooth and steady transition. With 
each passing year, non-US markets have become more “information efficient,”2 
and the MSCI EAFE+C Index (Morgan Stanley Capital International—Europe, 
Australia, Far East, plus Canada Index) has moved up to around the 25% level. 
Over at least the last half decade, about a quarter of investment managers have 
outperformed the benchmark, while three-quarters have failed to do so.
1The main explanation for the last place rank for the index in 1991–1993 and the first 
place rank in 1989 and 1995 is due largely to Japan. Japan at the time had a total market 
capitalization that started to rival the United States. Investment managers almost to a one 
were afraid of committing that much to a single market and universally underweighted 
Japan. When Japan did well, the index looked fantastic. When Japan did poorly, all managers 
who kept a lower-than-market weight in the country (almost all of them) outperformed 
the benchmark.
2Meaning that information about any company that might affect the stock price is more 
quickly disseminated to the marketplace and is rapidly reflected in the stock price. With 
openness and transparency come more rapid market reaction and less time for any 
individual piece of information to be used for personal gain.

For all you emerging markets fans out there, I saved the best for last for you 
in Figure 3-5. Emerging markets are countries that would have been consid-
ered as belonging to the Third World a few decades ago. Today, many of these 
countries have created world-class companies that can compete against their 
Western competitors very successfully, yet the countries still have smaller and 
less liquid stock markets, poorer legal controls, and limits on capital flows in and 
out of the country, thereby posing additional risks to investors beyond simply 
market returns. As these countries develop, they can progress from “emerging” 
to “developed” and move from market index to index. Consequently, after 
the index publishers give their stamp of approval to a country and pronounce 
it to now be “developed,” they become available for investments from many 
more investors.

Whereas recent evidence shows that only a quarter of the 463 emerging 
markets mutual funds in this data set have outperformed the MSCI Emerging 
Markets Index, the longer-term track record for this population of manag-
ers is far better, with the majority of investment managers having achieved 
extended periods of outperformance in the past. Like with developed mar-
kets, continued improvements in regulatory oversight, liquidity, and corporate 
transparency will likely lead to greater market efficiency for emerging mar-
kets—and that trend is obvious in the steady upward movement of the index 
in Figure 3-5, which indicates that emerging markets seem to be on a path to 
an environment in which it is far harder to add consistent value. Although 
there has been at least some evidence of the historic ability of investment 
managers to outperform, that may not be the case going forward.
Value versus Growth Investing
At this point, let's shift the discussion to “style bias” within portfolios. Value and 
growth investing are two very different styles of stock selection that can gener-
ate divergent returns for long periods of time. Value investors are considered 
the bargain hunters of the investment world, looking for stocks that are cheaper 
than average, usually with a high dividend. Some value stocks have low prices 
because they have fallen on hard times, like financial stocks did after the 2008 
credit crisis, while others are simply companies that grow slowly and generate 
high cash yields, like utilities. Growth stock investors, on the other hand, are the

optimists of the stock world, always looking for the Next Big Thing that will 
change the world. They are not buying stocks based just on the price today 
relative to the value of the underlying assets, but rather the potential value of 
those assets three or five years or more into the future, when the company’s 
brilliant new invention has hit it big.
In 1999, I was asked by a potential client: “Is value investing dead?” The question  
was intriguing. At the time, technology and growth stocks were riding high on 
the unbelievable, and soon-to-crash, dot-com bubble. I’ll go into more detail 
on this concept later in this chapter, but for the purposes of this example, 
academic theory says that growth and value investing should generally 
balance each other out over a period of many years, and neither growth nor 
value investing should have a systematic long-term performance advantage. 
However, one of these two “styles” can persistently outperform the other 
for several years at a time before it reverts—and, as seen in 2001, when the 
dot-com bubble finally burst, that reversion often can be violent.
You may be wondering what my response was to the prospective client’s 
question. Unfortunately, I do not have a crystal ball. At the time, I gave the best 
answer any consultant could and proceeded to tell that prospective client 
and a few existing clients that I thought this bubble was overdone, that cycles 
will mean-revert at some point, and that they should avoid chasing returns. 
However, like many in the industry, I didn’t make any major changes to what  
I was recommending to my clients at the time, nor did I flee away from growth 
stocks like one might from a tidal wave. Of course, hindsight is always 20/20. 
If only everyone could have known that the technology bubble was going to 
burst. Perhaps in hindsight the mere fact that someone was asking that ques-
tion was a sign to run from growth stocks screaming for the hills.
In practice, most pension plans do not bias their portfolios toward a growth 
or value style but remain “style neutral” over time, with equal positions in 
both styles. Any investor looking to control overall risk in his or her portfolio 
should do the same.
In Figure 3-6, I have plotted the rolling three-year performance of the Russell 
1000 Value Index less the performance of the Russell 1000 Growth Index 
since the inception of both indices more than 40 years ago. When the moving 
line is above the 0 point in the middle, value stocks are outperforming growth 
stocks on a medium-term basis. When the jagged line dips below the 0 line, 
the markets are in a period where growth stocks are outperforming value 
stocks.

Some experts believe value investing is the One True Way to Wealth because, 
like people who love to clip coupons or look for bargains at garage sales, 
buying something for less than it is really worth tends to reap strong results. 
However, the bad news is that you can see that there are meaningful peri-
ods of time where growth investing dramatically outperforms value investing. 
Fortunately for value investing aficionados, though, over the very long term, 
the cumulative track record has historically favored investing above growth 
investing. Figure 3-7 shows this outperformance.

From the inception of the Russell 1000 Growth and Value indexes to the 
present day, value investing has indeed generated more cumulative performance 
than growth investing. However, you can see that the two lines in Figure 3-7 have 
crossed in the past, when the cumulative record of one starts to exceed the other, 
such as in 1998 and 2000. Although the markets have been in an extended value 
cycle since the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000, the historical record 
indicates that this will not persist forever. Growth and value styles will revert again 
in the future, as they did in Figure 3-6 every time growth stocks jumped ahead 
and as happened in the early and late 1990s and from 2007 to 2012.
Furthermore, for those who believe in the long-term track record of value 
over growth, even if you had bought into the value-investing concept years 
ago, could you have lived with the volatility between these styles, as seen in 
Figure 3-7? Look at the tremendous outperformance of growth over value in 
the period from 1994 to 2000. Are you absolutely positive that you would have 
never thrown in the towel during one of those go-go growth periods, where 
all the press attention was about the latest world-changing technology stock? 
In all likelihood, unless you had a clear discipline to value invest through thick 
and through thin, it would have been very, very difficult to stay that course 
through some of the periods of strong growth performance. Figure 3-8 shows 
the two styles again with the addition of the S&P 500 Index.

As shown by the S&P 500 index in Figure 3-8, a style-neutral approach gets 
you to roughly the same place as growth and value investing do after 
34 years—and it does so with far less interim volatility by balancing the two 
style indices year in and year out.
What does this mean? Do pension plans never invest in growth or value 
managers? Of course they do. Many plans that understand the benefits of 
avoiding an overall style bias will still choose individual managers of all types 
(some plans do hire only core managers or broad index funds). However, 
instead of picking just one style or the other, plans with an eye on risk 
controls pick the best of breed of both kinds and try to keep their assets 
relatively even between them.
For every superstar value investor like Warren Buffett, who is out there 
looking for underpriced stocks forgotten by the market, there exists an 
equally great growth investor who is prescient about what technological 
advances will generate big returns tomorrow. Most of the fame and fortune 
acquired by Capital Guardian/American Funds and Janus came from a pro-
clivity toward, and some very real skill in, growth investing, whereas firms 
like Sanford Bernstein (now part of AllianceBernstein) and Dimensional 
Fund Advisors (DFA) have had great success with value. Keep in mind that 
value investing and growth investing are two very different skill sets, and  
I have heard many reasonable arguments for why some special talent that 
can generate returns above the market over the long term might exist in 
either field. However, when you do pick your favorite value fund (or two 
or three for diversification), just make sure that you also have a meaningful

investment in growth funds that offsets your exposure. This combination 
will help to ensure that your returns come from the real skill of both sets 
of investment managers and not simply from the incremental volatility of a 
subsection of the stock market.
If you believe that one style of investing holds more promise than the other 
for active management (e.g., you really believe that value pickers like Warren 
Buffett can beat the market while growth managers cannot really predict tech-
nology cycles), you don’t have to pick active managers for both growth and 
value. Plenty of growth and value index funds and ETFs exist that can offset 
the incremental market risk of the style you like. Lists of these are available 
through every bank or brokerage’s mutual fund screening tools or through 
industry web sites like Morningstar.com. Buy all the active value funds you like, 
if that is your preference, but offset that resulting bias with a low-cost growth 
stock index fund that protects you against being too wedded to the periodic 
bumps in the road that either style can experience.
Large and Small Capitalization Investing
A similar argument to that which I made for growth and value investing can be 
made for the merits of investing in large versus small companies. The world 
of active investors can be divided into two more camps: those that prefer 
large capitalization (large cap) companies, or the companies with the largest 
total stock market values, and those that prefer small capitalization (small cap) 
companies, or companies with a relatively small total value of their outstand-
ing stock. The breathless reporting in 2011 and 2012 about how Apple was 
progressively the eighth biggest company on Earth, then bigger than Microsoft, 
then Exxon, then the GDP of Poland,3 then the sum total of all the goodness 
and light and puppies in the universe,4 and so on, is an example of, in this case, 
the media’s obsession with large cap stocks.
Plenty of investors are equally obsessed with small cap stocks, always looking for 
some diamond in the rough that has technology that will eclipse anything else 
known to man but is not yet reflected in the price of the stock. If you know a 
stockbroker, chances are he has plenty of these to sell you. All it takes is one or 
two to quadruple in value to prove to him that small caps are the best way to go, 
even if 90% of his picks never pan out. We always remember our winners.
3This is a real example. Yes, I know that market capitalization is a measure of worth and 
GDP is a measure of income and the two are not comparable. Please explain this to the 
news web site (which shall go nameless) that published this story or otherwise just feel 
free to share my frustration with the financial mass media.
4This is not a real example.

In my experience, both types of people can be right. And both can be wrong, 
too. Dominant large cap companies tend to rule the roost for a decade or a 
century, generating great cash flow for their investors. On the flip side, there is 
always some start-up company (or “fallen angel,” like when Apple was trading 
for $7 a share in 2003) that will prove to be a game changer five years later, 
when the stock is selling for $500.
The problem is that while I can think of plenty of individual examples of 
large and small companies that have done well, exactly as described previously, 
there are thousands of start-ups that languished or failed and hundreds of 
examples of leading large cap companies that missed the next wave and were 
eclipsed by a smaller competitor. As the evidence demonstrates, neither has a 
categorical advantage over the other. Figure 3-9 shows the cumulative returns 
of large capitalization stocks (represented by the S&P 500 Index) versus 
small capitalization stocks (represented by the Russell 2000 Index) since the  
inception of that small cap benchmark.

As with growth versus value investing, periods of large and small cap stock 
outperformance repeat market cycle after market cycle. Over the course 
of 34 years, the complete history of the Russell 2000 small cap stock index, 
Figure 3-9 shows that neither has any advantage, with the three-plus decade 
cumulative returns for both the S&P500 Index and the Russell 2000 Index 
at almost the exact same level. As with the historical cumulative perfor-
mance of value and growth investing styles, it is clear that the additional 
volatility of investing in just one size group of stocks dwarfs any potential 
performance advantage. The dramatic cumulative outperformance of large 
cap stocks by the end of 1999, followed by the return to almost identical 
historical performance by 2005, indicates how much rougher the path is for 

Invest Like an Institution
57
someone with either a large cap or small cap size bias in their portfolio to 
reach the same endpoint.
Academic studies5 have generally concluded that small cap stocks outper-
form large cap stocks over long periods of time, due to the facts that there 
are more small cap stocks among which winners can emerge and the biggest 
companies have nowhere to go but down. Many of these results, however, 
have been questioned by practitioners, who rely more on real-world practical 
observation than just a database of returns. Maybe the small cap index does 
outperform the large cap index over some time periods (as some academic 
research has shown, unlike what is shown in Figure  3-9), but transactions 
costs like commissions can be higher among small cap stocks and eat into 
any performance advantage they might have. Furthermore, stock exchange 
liquidity and the markt impact of trading is far greater among small cap stocks, 
and management fees charged by mutual funds and other professional invest-
ment portfolios tend to be 50% to 100% higher for small cap stocks than for 
large cap. Once you include all of these effects, as well as the aforementioned 
increase in volatility from picking just one size group of stocks, I’m not 
convinced that pure small cap investing is worth the incremental risk that a 
size-biased portfolio can create. And, as shown in Figure 3-9, the 2000 stocks 
in the Russell 2000 seem to have generated the same returns as the S&P 500 
since the inception of the Russell 2000.
As a result of the apparent lack of systematic biases to any particular size or 
style of investments, the vast majority of pension plans tend to maintain “size 
neutrality,” which is similar to the “style neutrality” discussed previously. If the 
Wilshire 5000 Index6 contains about 80% of its value in the 500 or 1,000 larg-
est stocks and 20% in the rest, most pension plans will allocate 80% of their 
money in US equities to large cap managers and 20% to mid cap and small cap 
managers to eliminate any systematic bias to one particular market capitaliza-
tion group over another.
Middle Capitalization Investing (Mid Cap Stocks)
The number of stocks on the US stock market has varied in my career from 
3,500 to 9,000, and we are currently around the low end, with a little more 
than 3,900 tradable, liquid stocks available on today’s market. Of all those public 
5Many, including “Small Cap Opportunity, Too Big to Ignore?,” Financial Advisor Magazine, 
June 19, 2012.
6The name of the Wilshire 5000 Index is a bit of a misnomer. Whereas the S&P 500 Index 
normally contains 500 stocks (sometimes a few drop out due to mergers or bankruptcies 
and are not replaced for a few weeks), the Wilshire 5000 Index simply contains ALL stocks 
in the United States and has ranged from 3,500 to 9,000 stocks over time, depending on 
how many are actually trading on exchanges. As a result, the Wilshire 5000 is generally 
considered to be the best measure of the entire US stock market.

Chapter 3 | Investment Structure for Stocks, Part I
58
companies, large capitalization stocks (sometimes called “large cap stocks”) 
generally encompass the largest 500 to 1,000 companies in the United States, 
rank ordered by pure market capitalization (the total value of all their shares 
at current prices). The S&P 500 index, for example, is generally the most 
broadly followed large cap benchmark and includes 500 of the largest (but 
not necessarily the actual 500 largest) stocks in the United States. The Russell 
1000 Index, meanwhile, generally includes the 1,000 largest stocks in the 
United States. Other vendors use different counts (Wilshire includes the larg-
est 750 companies, for example), but they all get to generally the same place 
and represent the returns of most of the largest companies. In contrast, the 
Russell 2000 Index, the most commonly used small cap index, contains stocks 
1,001 through 3,000, in a rank order listing of all US stocks by market cap.7  
But what about middle capitalization companies?
Middle capitalization companies—or “mid cap” stocks, for short—fall into 
that nebulous donut hole between large and small cap stocks. If your invest-
ment managers are using the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 as their large and 
small benchmarks, for example, stocks 501 through 1,000 (allowing for the 
fact that the S&P 500 is not comprised of precisely the 500 largest companies) 
aren’t covered by their benchmarks. If they use the Russell 1000 (which is a 
pretty rare occurrence) and Russell 2000, though, the problem is defined away. 
But if they use the Wilshire Large Cap 750 (rarer still) and the FTSE small cap 
benchmark (impossibly rare), the donut hole comes back.
At the end of the day, does all this matter? In short, probably not. If you invest 
in a large cap index fund and a small cap index fund, the hole might still be 
there, since the most common large and small cap index funds try their best 
to match the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 indexes. As a result, I would sug-
gest that index-oriented investors are better served by just using a total US 
market index fund and reducing their portfolio’s complexity. However, if you 
use active managers for either the large or small cap portfolios, or both, this 
problem is smaller than it might appear to be.
Why is this so? Because, in reality, active investment managers color outside 
the lines a little. Large cap managers who try to beat the S&P 500 will buy 
stocks outside of the 500 companies in the index, usually reaching down into 
the next few hundred by size rank to find some companies that are a little less 
researched by Wall Street analysts or their peers. Small cap managers, meanwhile, 
will hang onto many of their great performing positions even as they climb 
in value firmly into the mid cap range. At the end of the day, both the large 
and small cap managers will pick over the best of that mid cap opportunity  
set so much that it really isn’t as big of a chasm as you might guess.
7Neither Russell benchmark is adjusted on a daily basis. Stocks are added and deleted periodically 
as events warrant. As a result, some stocks in either benchmark may not necessarily be among 
the largest 1,000 or precisely the next 2,000 at any particular point in time.

There is even a name for such small cap managers that hang onto their 
winners as they creep into the mid-cap arena while still looking for new 
investments among the smallest companies: “SMid”—an amalgamation of 
“small” and “mid” to indicate a blending of the two styles of investment.
From Small to Small-Middle to Mid Cap Investing
Most small cap managers worth their salt will resist managing infinitely large 
amounts of money. In my experience, good small cap managers will normally 
cap or limit their assets under management to $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion for 
all clients. Small cap stocks, as commonly defined, tend to have market capi-
talizations of around $2 billion or less. When investing in these companies, 
investment managers usually want to hold very small fractions (at most, usu-
ally a few percentage points of the total stock) of the outstanding shares of a 
given company—especially when the stocks of the companies are as illiquid 
as small cap companies are for trading. In addition, investment managers 
normally will hold between 50 and 200 stocks in most actively managed small 
cap portfolios. If you add up those factors—small allocations to maybe 100 
companies, none of which are bigger than $2 billion—you simply can’t end 
up with a huge portfolio that holds tens of billions of dollars. What’s more, 
compounding these factors are the buyers of these portfolios, the large insti-
tutional investors who dictate many of the terms in the marketplace. Most of 
these clients will tend to shun small cap investment managers who lack the 
discipline to close their portfolios to additional client contributions or new 
clients above a certain reasonable level of assets.
On the other hand, like many people, asset managers like to make money, 
and they know that the more client assets they manage, the more fees they 
collect, and the more money they can make. In addition, they like to add staff 
to their teams to expand their capabilities, creating more opportunity to add 
value for their clients. Unlike large cap investing or core fixed income, though, 
which are virtually infinitely scalable (more than one well-known core fixed 
income portfolio manager now has well over $500 billion in assets) given the 
size of those respective markets, the resources for small cap managers are 
limited by the size of the portfolios. Adding a needed sixth or seventh company 
research analyst to the team, a back-up trader, or a new client service person 
simply may not be feasible because the amount of fees the investment man-
ager can earn on a size-limited portfolio is, as the adjective implies, limited.  
A $2 billion small cap portfolio that charges 0.75% a year in fees will generate  
$15 million in income. By the time the firm pays all of its investment and 
client service people, as well as all of its overhead and travel expenses, the 
cost of adding more analysts may not be affordable if the firm plans to limit 
its total assets to something close to that current $2 billion level.

Chapter 3 | Investment Structure for Stocks, Part I
60
What’s a growth-minded investment manager to do? Pressures from clients to 
bring fees down are unrelenting, as are the pressures from corporate manage-
ment or company ownership to deliver better results every year. As a result, 
investment managers will offer Mid-Cap or SMid portfolios as a way to lever-
age their current resources in a slightly larger market. (“SMid” cap investing, 
by the way, is the nickname for small-middle capitalization investing.)
Because the portfolio manager’s most successful company investments have 
typically grown from a small capitalization size into several billion dollars or 
more, the argument could be made that the team already understands many 
of the companies in this new sector. If the portfolio manager has demon-
strated the ability to consistently add value over the benchmark for stocks 
worth less than $2 billion, it follows logically that companies that have reached 
$5 billion are not especially dissimilar, and the portfolio team's investment 
acumen should generate similar results.
I don’t necessarily disagree with that premise, and I have generally observed 
that SMid and Mid-Cap managers who have performed well generally have 
decent small cap products to offer to clients. And vice versa. My objection to 
SMid and Mid Cap, however, stems more from the overlap issues. If you have a 
small cap manager that is doing well—and is probably cheating a little by delving  
into mid cap stocks—as well as a large cap manager who is also dropping into 
the upper range of mid cap stocks with some of his investments, adding a dedi-
cated mid cap manager usually leads to a significant amount of overlap with 
the large and small cap managers. A SMid portfolio has even greater overlap 
with small cap stocks, leading to the significant overweighting of this invest-
ment style. While I see nothing wrong in concept with the idea of mid cap or 
SMid investing, the overlap with the other managers and funds in the portfolio 
leads to unwanted duplication of some positions and a general overallocation 
to mid cap stocks.
So, why not just abandon small cap and find only a SMid manager? Great question.  
In concept, this should work perfectly: find a one-size-fits-all solution to 
your entire less-than-large-cap portfolio needs. In practice, though, it doesn’t 
quite turn out the way you might expect. Remember the reason behind offer-
ing the SMid portfolio in the first place? The manager had reached the maxi-
mum manageable portfolio size for small cap investing and needed to move 
up the capitalization spectrum to continue to grow capacity and maximize 
corporate or personal income. For a manager who has both a small and a 
SMid portfolio, ask yourself, “If the small cap portfolio has reached its maxi-
mum, how many of those beloved small cap stocks are really in the SMid 
portfolio? Is the SMid portfolio just a way of disguising a mid cap portfolio as 
a small cap surrogate while continuing to charge (generally higher) small cap 
fees?” I usually find that the latter part of that question is the correct answer. 
The manager might throw a bone to small cap investing and include a handful 
of small cap stocks in a SMid portfolio. However, these stocks are usually the 

Invest Like an Institution
61
largest and most liquid companies in the small cap market, and their weight in 
the portfolio is dwarfed by the mid cap (and larger) companies.
Let’s explore this with a little math to understand the reality of this type of 
investing. If a SMid portfolio has $10 billion under management and the invest-
ment manager likes to hold 100 stocks, even a position as small as 0.50% of 
that portfolio (not all positions in a 100 stock portfolio may be of identical 
size) leads to an allocation of $50 million to a given company. In the case of 
a true small cap company with an $800 million market cap, $50 million is 
equivalent to more than 6% of all the stock in the company. If the manager has 
a parallel position in the same company within a small cap portfolio, he could 
be approaching 10% of the entire value of the company between those two 
portfolios, or more than 10% of the outstanding, tradable stock if some of the 
company is privately held by founders or executives. Although allocations of 
this size are not unheard of, they certainly are very uncommon and present a 
variety of risks to the portfolios, including the limited ability of the investment 
manager to liquidate that position in a timely and cost-effective manner when 
appropriate. Instead of buying stock in that $800 million company, therefore, 
it is far more likely that the SMid portfolio simply will not hold shares in this 
company and will gravitate toward larger companies. In the end, what is mar-
keted as a small-middle capitalization focus is really a middle-middle capitaliza-
tion portfolio, with small cap stocks all but abandoned.
Summary
Investors, including large pension plans, like to take risks—as long as they 
understand the risks they are taking—and expect to be rewarded for taking 
them. After all, to earn any decent return, taking risks are necessary. However, 
when an investor takes risks, the return potential should be both apparent and 
proportionate to compensate him or her for the risks taken.
In this section, I have outlined the pros and cons of taking risk in active man-
agement versus passive management. I leave it to you, the individual investor, 
to assess whether you are smarter (or just luckier) than others and can select 
actively managed investment products that can consistently outperform the 
broader stock market.
More important, I have shown that although one should take risk to earn 
reward, there are many risks that are simply not worth taking. Significant size 
and style biases within portfolios add a tremendous amount of excess volatility  
over time, but they do very little to improve returns. If you wish to invest in 
an active manager who you think will outperform in some market segment, 
like small cap growth or large cap value, I wish you all the luck in the 
world. At the same time, however, I admonish you to offset that unrewarded 
style-based risk with another active or passive investment manager that brings 
all your investments on balance back to a broad market exposure.

In Chapter 3, I explained the basics of size and style biases (and the uncom-
pensated risk that can result from adding a bias to your portfolio), and I 
also shed some light on the question of active versus passive management 
in equities. In this chapter, I will discuss two more major topics that inves-
tors should consider when determining how to structure an equity portfo-
lio. First, I will address the question of how large pension plans think about  
how to allocate among US and non-US stock investments. Later in this chapter,  
I will expand the active versus passive management discussion from  
Chapter 3 into a wider review of the variety of products available to inves-
tors within the equity market and some of the more unique investment phi-
losophies that are offered.

In the recurrent Road Map to Financial Success, we will stay in the second box 
on our path because this chapter continues the discussion of the proper 
structure for your equity portfolio. It also expands the discussion in  
Chapter 3 to topics beyond simple domestic structure considerations.
Global Portfolio versus Home Country Bias
Before the mid-2000s, it was common for the non-US portions of a pension 
plan’s stock investments to constitute a quarter or a third of all its stocks. In 
other words, the typical plan had a ratio of three or four dollars invested in 
US stocks for every dollar invested overseas—and this wasn’t just a US phe-
nomenon. As shown in Figure 4-1, even as late as 2007, pension plans in the 
UK invested 50% of their equity money in UK stocks despite the fact that UK 
stocks were less than 10% of the global opportunity set. Continental European 
stocks made up only 21% of the global equity benchmark, yet German plans 
on average had 70% of their equity assets invested in Europe, French pension 
plans bought 75% of their stocks in Europe, and Italian pension plans found 
88% of their stock investments in Europe.

Lately, however, there has been a seismic shift away from this “home coun-
try bias,” especially among large institutional US plans, toward a more global 
approach to investing. The US markets comprise roughly 45% of global stock 
market capitalization, and clients have been moving toward an investment 
structure that mimics that reality. Not everyone has gone to a 55% non-US / 
45% US position, but even a 50/50 split is a big step in the right direction.
To illustrate the fallacy of maintaining a home country-biased portfolio, what if 
I told you that my stock portfolio arbitrarily underweighted companies based 
in Washington, Florida, Arizona, and Minnesota just because I wanted to? Or, 
as discussed in Chapter 1, what if I significantly underweighted certain indus-
tries or countries not as part of a legitimate protest statement against them 
but just because I thought it would make no difference? You would think I 
was crazy. What if I asserted that there is no reason why a company based 
in Minnesota should have better or worse operational prospects and future 
market returns than a similar company that was based in Wisconsin and 
therefore doesn’t need to be part of my portfolio? Would you also scoff at my 
logic if I increased my position in a company that moved its headquarters from 
Washington to Illinois (like Boeing did in 2000) just because that is where the 
CEO now calls home?

Well, the same logic, or lack thereof, applies to US and non-US investing. Here 
a few examples of how the companies in which you invest actually operate. 
Toyota makes roughly the same share of their cars in the US as does Ford. 
Coca-Cola makes far more of its revenues and profits outside the US than 
within it, as do Apple and Microsoft. SAP (a German software company) and 
Daimler Benz (the German parent of the Mercedes car company) make far 
more money outside Germany than within it. What makes Toyota Japanese; 
Ford, Microsoft, Apple, and Coca-Cola American; and SAP and Daimler Benz 
German? Not their sales, not their profits, not their competitors. Merely the 
location of their headquarters.
An August 2011 study released by S&P Dow Jones Indices reported that 
46.1% of the sales by companies in the S&P 500 were from operations out-
side the United States. This number was virtually unchanged from 46.3% of 
sales in 2010, 46.6% in 2009, and 47.9% in 2008, indicating that non-US oper-
ations are consistently a very large part of major companies’ ongoing and 
future plans. Those numbers were an average for all 500 of the companies 
in the stock index, and of course some American companies will derive a 
significantly higher or lower fraction of their sales outside the United States. 
Coca-Cola, for example, earns 80% of its operating income outside the United 
States,2 whereas a power utility like Duke Energy will receive the vast major-
ity of its income from US operations because it is impossible to bundle up 
its main product (electricity) and put it in a shipping container or FedEx it 
overseas. Does that make Coca-Cola less of an “American” company than 
Duke? Frankly, I am hard pressed to think of a more quintessentially American 
company than Coke, even if the lion’s share of their current operations and 
presumably almost all of their future growth will come from outside the US.
At the end of the day, GM, Ford, Chrysler, BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen Group, 
Fiat, Honda, Toyota, Mazda, and many others compete against each other on 
a global basis. Although some consumers might pick a car because of its per-
ceived “Made in America” connotation (even if that car was actually assembled 
by a US company in South Korea or Canada), the vast majority of new car 
shoppers decide based on features and price, or the concept of Japanese 
manufacturing quality, or German or Italian performance. Why should your 
portfolio be any less open minded than your personal shopping preferences? 
Shouldn’t the relative weights for BMW and GM in your portfolio be based 
on how well the companies will compete, profit, and grow over the next few 
years, not where the company’s lawyers file their paperwork?
The same can be said for a myriad of other industries. GE competes against 
Siemens in a wide variety of products. American drug manufacturers ­compete

predominantly against their Swiss counterparts. As it moves away from ­desktop 
computers and into mobile devices like phones and tablets, Apple competes 
much more against Samsung (Korean) and Nokia (Finnish) than it does against 
fellow American companies IBM and Microsoft. Let’s look at an absurd, but 
100% true, example, just to make the point. Imagine that you have a stock 
portfolio that is weighted 3 parts US stocks to 1 part non-US stocks—the 
typical mix that many pension plans held ten years ago and a weighting similar 
to what was shown in Figure 4-1 as a normal European home country bias 
just a few years ago. In this portfolio, you bought 100 shares of US automaker 
Chrysler in 1997. In 1998, when Chrysler became part of Daimler Chrysler, 
you had to reduce your position to 25 shares, not because you thought the 
company had changed and wasn’t a good investment for so much of your 
money, but because the headquarters was now in Germany and your 3:1 US 
to non-US weighting scheme dictated that you reduce your position. In 2007, 
Chrysler was bought by an American private equity company and became 
American again. As a result of its return to the United States, and had you 
been able to buy the (now privately held) stock, you would have bought 75 
shares to get back to your original US-first position. Then, when Chrysler 
merged with Fiat in 2011, an Italian company, you would have sold those 
75 shares again to get back to the proper weight in your portfolio because 
Chrysler, once more, became a foreign corporation. Do all those changes in 
your portfolio based on nothing other than the location of the corporate 
headquarters make any sense? Were any of those buys and sells based on how 
you thought Chysler would perform in the future? Wouldn’t you rather make 
rational investment decisions based on a company’s prospects for growth 
and profits than something as seemingly insignificant as the country the senior 
executives call home?
But, you may ask, what about the fact that China is booming or Italy and Greece 
are in the midst of an extended financial crisis? Does Japan’s demographic 
problem cause an investment problem? Don’t any of these considerations 
extend beyond the “invest in global competitors” argument posed above? 
Well, yes. In fact, pension funds have had concerns with investing directly in 
some countries for years, due to controls on capital flows (moving money 
into or out of the country), intellectual and other property rights, transpar-
ent and fair regulatory environments, liquid capital markets, human rights and 
freedoms, and a variety of other issues. As a result, the mantra among pension 
plans has often been, “Don’t invest in China/Russia/Venezuela/Fill In The Blank, 
and instead invest in companies doing business in China/Russia/Venezuela/Fill In 
The Blank.” You can still benefit from the inherent growth in these countries 
without many of the country-specific legal and other risks.
Today, partly as a result of pressure by some large pension plans and partly 
due simply to the forward momentum of history and progress, the specific 
fears about investing in some of these countries have dissipated. However, you 
don’t necessarily have to invest in country X to get exposure to country X,

just like investing in BMW isn’t really a pure investment in German equities 
anymore. As a result, many large pension funds have simply abandoned the 
concept of allocating separately to US and non-US stocks and have simply 
treated all stocks as one big asset class. As you design your portfolio, I encourage 
the reader to take an equally enlightened view of how capital markets have 
evolved over the last several years and embrace a global outlook just like so 
many large investors have done.
In the end, the advantages of a global portfolio versus a home country biased 
portfolio really boil down to risk reduction more than return enhancement. 
Maintaining a home-country-first approach to investing keeps a higher weight 
on Oracle over SAP, CitiBank over Barclays, GM over Toyota, and Boeing over 
Airbus. If my arguments are right, none of those positions should generate a 
systematic advantage over time and will serve only to increase the risk in your 
portfolio, just as a portfolio of any 20 stocks is more risky than one with 100 
stocks. Because markets for products are global, and capital flows are global, 
the only way to really embrace the opportunity set for stocks is to invest 
globally.
Other Types of Active and Quasi-Passive 
Equity Investment Management
In Chapter 3, I discussed some of the relative merits and demerits of active 
and passive investing, and when some investors might want to consider one 
over the other. In addition to these two traditional types of investment styles, 
pension plans and other institutional investors make widespread use of other 
types of equity strategies, including enhanced indexation and “alternative 
indexation” managers. Individual investors should be aware of these kinds of 
investments when they build out their portfolios.
Enhanced Indexation
Enhanced indexation is a broad title for two main types of portfolios but gen-
erally encompasses managers who seek to add small to medium amounts of 
value above the benchmark to their portfolios in a more consistent manner 
than a truly active portfolio does.
Pension plans who are fed up with the inconsistent performance of active 
managers and the higher fees demanded for that inconsistency have often 
turned to enhanced index managers as an alternative to both true active man-
agement and to just throwing in the towel and putting everything in an index 
fund. These managers will use highly risk-controlled portfolios, often driven 
by computer-based automated systems, to add half a percent or maybe a full 
percentage point of value above the benchmark as consistently as possible.  

Invest Like an Institution
69
In good markets and in bad, a great enhanced index manager should always be 
just a little bit better than the index it is tracking.
The main downside to this approach is evidenced by Figure 3-2 from the 
previous chapter, which showed how active large cap core managers actually 
performed fairly well during the credit crisis in 2008. By turning to cash, man-
agers were able to at least get a little bit of the portfolio out of the way of 
the market decline and protect some value for clients. Like fully passive index 
funds, enhanced index managers, on the other hand, would have remained as 
close to 100% invested as possible and ridden the rollercoaster straight down. 
When the market bounced in 2009, however, and those cash-hording active 
managers found themselves scrambling to catch up, enhanced index managers 
would have taken off with the market. So, once again, there is no free lunch. 
Active managers can protect value in a crash by shifting assets en masse to 
cash, but that can often come back to bite them later when they are not fully 
invested in a rising market. Passive managers and enhanced index managers, in 
contrast, will decrease your fees but capture all up and down market move-
ments. Which way you choose to go is really a function of your risk toler-
ance and how well you can stomach the day-to-day and year-to-year market 
gyrations.
So, after that preamble, what are these managers, and what do they do?
Stock Selection Strategies
The more common type of enhanced index managers employed by pension 
funds essentially are computer-automated actively managed portfolios. When 
stock analysts try to figure out which stocks they think are best for their funds 
to invest in, they typically have a number of qualitative metrics that they might 
apply when they screen the database of all stocks or analyze an individual 
stock for investment. These metrics might be things like the ratio of price to 
earnings, the ratio of price to book value, the annual dividend growth rate, the 
growth rate of revenues, the length of tenure of senior management, and so 
on. The portfolio manager could, for example, prefer to buy shares of com-
panies that have higher growth rates than the company’s peers and a lower 
price/book ratio.
Instead of hiring an army of analysts to fly around the country to meet with 
companies, build models, and simply reflect the public information that every-
one already knows, what if we could distill all that human decision making 
into a computerized stock picking process that uses the same tools as human 
analysts would to determine which stocks are underpriced and which are 
overpriced? Although you might need a team of mathematicians and com-
puter programmers to get the process rolling and to refine your models over 
time, a highly disciplined system of computer stock selection might remove 

Chapter 4 | Investment Structure for Stocks, Part II
70
the emotional aspects of “falling in love with a stock” from the investment 
management process.
To live up to the “enhanced index” name, the portfolio managers (or, more 
commonly, a portfolio construction software package) take the stocks that 
the models like and dislike and apply that information to the model portfolio. 
Let’s say that Apple is 4% of the S&P 500, Hewlett Packard is 1%, and IBM is 
1.5% at some particular time. The computer models think that HP is under-
priced and is a “buy,” Apple has an inflated price and is worth less than the 
market thinks, and IBM is about right. As a result, the portfolio construction 
process might buy 1.5% of the portfolio in HP (a very small overweight vs. 
the index) and buy 3.5% in Apple (a very small underweight). Note that even 
though the models say that Apple is overpriced,3 the portfolio will still hold a 
fairly large position in the company. Why? Because it comprises such a large 
share of the index that not holding the stock at all would add too much risk 
to the portfolio.
The index has a total of 6.5% in these three technology stocks, and so does 
the portfolio, resulting in no sector bias for or against technology stocks. In 
a similar vein, the portfolio could also slightly overweight Bank of America 
and underweight CitiGroup by the same amounts, and overweight GM at 
the expense of Ford. In all of these positions, the only difference from the 
index is that the securities weights in each sector vary from the index weight. 
Meanwhile, the weight of the total positions for the technology, finance, and 
transportation industries remains equal to that in the index.
If the automated stock selection and analysis process is right, the stock picks 
add a small amount of value relative to the index. If they are completely wrong, 
the losses won’t be all that great since the positions only differ from the 
index marginally. If one particular industrial sector skyrockets to the moon 
(see technology, circa 1998) or falls to Earth (see technology, circa 2001, or 
financials, circa 2008), the portfolio will not be affected relative to the index. 
Instead, it will rise or fall in value accordingly because the portfolio as a whole 
matches the index’s sector weights.
The point isn’t to knock the cover off the ball and realize tremendous gains. 
Rather, the point is to recognize that in some sectors—especially large cap 
core US equities, where enhanced indexation is most prevalent—stock selec-
tion is extraordinarily hard due to the efficiency of information. Consequently, 
investors should be happy with roughly the market returns plus a tiny bit of 
value-added.
3This is a purely hypothetical example to demonstrate how these models work. I am not  
passing judgment on the relative valuations of these or any other companies in this 
book, and I do not recommend that you buy or sell any of these stocks based on these 
hypothetical examples.

“Synthetic Equity” Strategies
Beware: this is the part where I will probably lose half my audience. Feel free 
to skip to the next section if this part gets to be a little complicated for your 
tastes.
The other type of enhanced index strategy commonly used by pension plans 
is called a “synthetic equity” portfolio. This type of portfolio never actually 
buys stocks at all, but rather relies on a variety of other securities to replicate 
stock market returns plus a little bit of value-added. In this type of product, 
the portfolio manager will buy stock index futures, which are very common 
derivatives contracts that trade on major exchanges and replicate the returns 
of an index very closely. These securities typically require that the buyer pay 
a small amount, typically 5% to 10% of the value of the security up front. The 
other 90% to 95% of the synthetic equity manager’s cash is available to settle 
daily mark-to-markets4 in the value of the futures and are priced so that the 
buyer pays a short-term, overnight interest rate in exchange for the privilege 
of only paying 5% of the value up front. In this kind of strategy, instead of 
investing in low-risk T-bills or other cash-like securities, this remaining cash 
typically is invested in short-term fixed income securities, like corporate 
bonds or mortgage bonds, which should earn a slightly higher yield than the 
cash interest rate.
Generally speaking, these portfolios deliver fairly consistently small positive 
returns above the benchmark. For example, if the manager can buy one-year 
debt that earns 1.00% and is paying 0.25% as a financing rate for the futures, 
the net return to the portfolio is 0.75% above the S&P 500, with a minimum 
of risk in normal markets. However, if the interest rate spreads (the amount 
of additional yield earned by investments in assets riskier than government 
bonds) spike upward and/or the corporate investments default, you can 
expect to incur losses in the bond portfolio because you are holding one-year 
debt that will fall in value during periods of rapid upward rate movement. For 
a great example of how interest rate spreads can grow dramatically in a very 
short period of time, causing widespread underperformance in these types of 
investments, look to 2008, when rapid movements in interest rates severely 
impacted investors. In contrast, though, investors with a long-time horizon 
who stayed with these kinds of investments earned back those losses and 
then some when rates returned to more normal levels in 2009 and 2010.
How have enhanced index managers done?
4If the index rises 1% in a day, the holder of a stock index futures contract will receive that 
1% in cash at the end of that day. Similarly, if the index falls, the contract holder needs to 
provide the cash value of that daily loss. Some or all of the other 90% to 95% held in cash 
is usually kept fairly liquid to enable these types of daily settlements.

Chapter 4 | Investment Structure for Stocks, Part II
72
Not all that badly. Figure 4-2 shows that at least half of all enhanced index 
managers have outperformed the benchmark in virtually all time periods dat-
ing back to the 1980s. Over the last five years, the index has ranked between 
50% and 80% vs. the managers, indicating that there is a pretty good chance 
that many managers might actually generate consistent value for clients.

*Data courtesy of eVestment Alliance
I’ve always believed that there is some logic to why enhanced indexation 
should make sense, given that you incur lower fees and the stock selection 
process is less emotional. Although this chart isn’t perfect, the index has pretty 
consistently ranked below the 50th percentile, with only a couple of periods 
above that level. For the period studied, 2000 to present (I used a shorter 
time frame here given the relatively short history of the enhanced indexation 
industry), you appear to have a decent chance of finding a superior manager. 
The managers outperform about half the time, which is far better than we saw 
in Chapter 3 for traditional large cap core active equity managers.
Alternative Beta Managers
The last potential equity investment that pension plans are making occurs 
rarely among mutual funds and other investment options available to clients. 
Still, alternative beta managers have received quite a bit of press lately and are 
starting to see some traction in the retail marketplace.

Invest Like an Institution
73
To understand alternative beta managers, you first need to understand “beta,” 
which is a fancy word that institutional investors use to describe “market 
exposure.” If they “buy some beta,” it means that they are moving from cash 
into broad stock market exposure, like index funds. Likewise, if a given invest-
ment strategy is described as “nothing but beta,” it means that the investment 
manager isn’t really delivering any skill in the portfolio and is earning returns 
that simply track the ups and downs of the stock market. Alternative beta 
strategies, then, are a very complicated, yet widespread, way of saying “market 
exposure that reflects the performance of something other than the index 
fund.” These types of strategies come in a wide variety of forms and have even 
been used to try to replicate the returns of hedge funds and real estate (more 
on this in Chapters 8 and 10). For the individual investor, however, the most 
common of these is something called “fundamental indexing,” which implies 
that something other than pure market capitalization is used as the basis for 
calculating the index weights.
In a traditional index, if the sum of all companies’ market capitalizations is $5 
trillion and a given company has a market capitalization of $100 billion, that 
company’s stock will comprise 2% of the index. As a result, a money manager 
with $100,000,000 to invest in an index fund will buy $2,000,000 worth of 
that company’s stock. This methodology reflects the simple fact that the mar-
ket has spoken and priced this stock at $100 billion, for whatever reason, and 
that the full opportunity set of all stocks should include a 2% allocation to this 
company. In fundamental indexation, however, so-called real-world factors are 
used to compute the weights in the index. Instead of using the value of the 
company’s stock market capitalization to determine weighting, fundamental 
indexation relies on a formula that includes things such as the revenues of 
all companies, their physical assets, their net income, total employees, etc., to 
­re-weight the stocks in an index based on their real weights in the economy, 
not just the stock market’s perceived value of their worth.
In practice, fundamental indexation strategies generally look like an expen-
sive way to buy a mid-cap value strategy, with a few little twists thrown in. 
Fundamental indexation will underweight stocks undergoing bubbles and buy 
companies that the market is undervaluing. In general, this means that compa-
nies with slightly smaller market capitalizations might appear to be cheaper, all 
else being equal. In addition, growth companies that are being priced based on 
hope for their earnings in five years will be underweighted to allow for greater 
positions in solid but boring companies with larger sales but less growth: the 
very definition of a value strategy.
The bottom line is that although all these enhanced index managers may 
sound like “the better mousetrap” and the solution to avoiding all bubbles and 
speculation pricing forever, a much cheaper solution has been out there for a 
long time—value index funds. As is the case with so much else in this industry, 

Chapter 4 | Investment Structure for Stocks, Part II

always look twice at a new product that is promising the world. Either there 
is far more in the fine print that takes the promises down a notch or it is a 
repackaging of something that you can already get cheaper somewhere else.
Summary
As I have shown in this chapter and Chapter 3, although there is no easy or 
simple answer to the question of how to structure your portfolio, there are 
a number of rules of thumb that can help to diversify your investments and 
reduce unwanted and uncompensated risks. As they construct their equity 
portfolios, both pension plans and individual investors need to consider a 
wide variety of sometimes confusing topics, including active versus passive 
versus enhanced versus alternative beta, growth versus value, large versus 
small, and domestic market versus foreign markets once they determine 
their allocation to equities in the asset allocation step outlined in Chapter 2.  
In practice, however, balancing risk, return, and cost is actually very simple to 
do—just make sure that you are getting what you really want and what you 
paid for. Common mistakes such as investing small fractions of your portfolio 
in each of ten active growth funds and ten active value funds will most likely 
generate the return stream in aggregate of a very expensive index fund, not 
some kind of magical outperforming composite of 20 different investment 
managers. Another common mistake, taking a large style bias, such as over-
weighting growth stocks 5 to 1 relative to value stocks in your portfolio may 
generate some very nice gains in a given year that growth stocks do well, but 
that same portfolio will significantly cost you when the value cycle returns 
(and it always has returned eventually).
Remember that asset allocation, as we discussed in Chapter 2, drives 90% of 
your expected return and total risk. In my experience, however, investment 
structure mistakes can drive 90% of an investor’s unwanted risks. An over-
weight to growth, or small, or emerging markets can be entirely unintended 
and merely a by-product of what was thought to be good manager selection, 
but this type of unintentional style bias is what will hurt you the most when 
you aren’t looking out for it and growth or value rapidly reverts against the 
other like growth-biased investing did in 2001 when the NASDAQ boom 
came to an end.
Finally, it is common practice among pension plans to mix and match styles 
and types of investments when building an equity portfolio, and there is no 
reason you cannot do the same thing. Let’s say you found an active large cap 
value fund that you love, but you cannot find a tolerable large cap growth 
fund. Then just invest in a growth index fund to offset that style risk from the 
value manager. If you want to index your large cap investments and choose 

Invest Like an Institution
75
active managers for your small cap dollars, just understand the risks that you 
are ­taking, and make sure that the risks you don’t want to take are not finding 
their way into the portfolio on their own.
Above all else, remember this simple truth: there is no free lunch in equity 
investing. The sum of all the investors in stocks is the market return, or worse. 
Once you deduct the large active management fees charged to investors in 
mutual funds and other investment products, everyone does worse off in 
aggregate than if everyone had invested in the index. In Chapter 7 I will dis-
cuss the art and science behind how pension funds select asset managers, but 
bear in mind the moral of the story of the data I have presented here: active 
managers as a whole, especially in developed markets like the United States, 
have generally underperformed their stock market benchmarks the majority 
of the time. Sure, you can certainly pick a winner here and there that will 
serve you well for decades at a time, but those are few and far between. Be 
selective with your usage of active managers because they cost you far more 
than the index fund alternative and rarely live up to the high promise of out-
performance in their advertisements.

The Basic Characteristics of Fixed Income
5
C H A P T E R 
Parallel to the discussion of the investment structure for equities that I pre-
sented in Chapters 3 and 4 is a consideration of the investment structure for 
your fixed income investments (otherwise known by this asset class’s simpler 
and more common name, “bonds") in this chapter and in Chapter 6. As you 
can see, we have moved to a new box that is parallel to our equity structure 
considerations in our recurring Road Map to Financial Success. As with equi-
ties, once you have determined during the asset allocation step how much you 
should invest in fixed income in general, you must then answer the question of 
how you should construct your fixed income portfolio. However, because the 
fixed income structure that you select is independent of your equity structure 
and really should be chosen at about the same time, these are simultaneous 
and not sequential steps.

Chapter 5 | Investment Structure for Fixed Income, Part I
78
Fixed income investing is generally considered to be more complicated than 
equity investing because the mathematics and probabilities of yield (interest 
rate paid), duration (interest rate risk), and default risk (risk of losing money 
due to bankruptcy) are far more complex than the optimism of stock selec-
tion. However, determining the fixed income investment structure in your 
portfolio and for a large pension plan or endowment can really be boiled 
down to a few decisions:
1.	 How much “duration” do you want in the portfolio?
2.	 How much credit risk (default risk) do you want in the 
portfolio?
3.	 How much active or passive management do you want in 
the portfolio?
4.	 Do you wish to invest only in the United States, or are 
there advantages to investing outside of your home 
market?
I will review each of these decisions in turn, covering the more technical topics 
of duration and credit risk in this chapter and the more personal preference 
questions of desired manager risk level and global investments in Chapter 6.
Duration
There is a really long and complicated definition of what duration is, how it is 
calculated, and how it is used in practice. If you would like to really understand 
the concept, I can recommend some terrific textbooks such as The Handbook 
of Fixed Income Securities, by Frank Fabozzi, which is generally considered to 
be the bible of the fixed income industry. The simple explanation of duration, 
however, starts with the fact that most fixed income securities pay coupons 
(periodic interest payments) over the life of the bond and principal (the face 
amount of the bond) at maturity.

1I am simplifying the math a little here. Again, please refer to Frank Fabozzi’s The Handbook 
of Fixed Income Securities if you need to understand the precise calculations.
When you buy a bond, duration is the weighted average of how long it will 
take you to receive all of those interest and principal payments. Two bonds 
with the same final maturity date can have different durations if the coupons 
are meaningfully different. Imagine a bond that pays a semiannual 1% coupon 
and another that pays a 4% semiannual coupon. Even though both bonds pay 
you $1,000 at maturity, the bond with the higher coupon will have a some-
what shorter duration because a larger share of the total cash flows you will 
receive over the life of the bond are paid in earlier years.
I recognize that very few people reading this book are likely to be building 
their own portfolios of individual bonds; and those that are building their own 
probably understand fixed income concepts far more than I will explain here. 
Therefore, for the average person who invests in mutual funds, I will discuss 
duration in the context of how it should influence your choice of investment 
managers and how you should structure your overall fixed income portfolio.
Why Duration is Meaningful to You
Duration has a second purpose other than a calculation of time of cash flow 
receipt, one that really is meaningful to investors in mutual funds and other 
portfolios of fixed income that are constructed by professionals. In short, 
duration measures the sensitivity of a bond or a portfolio of bonds to move-
ments in interest rates.
The total return to an investor from a bond comes from two different sources. 
First, the bond pays a set amount of interest (coupons) every year. Second, 
assuming the entity who issued the bond does not default or go into bank-
ruptcy, you will receive the face value of the bond at maturity. In contrast to 
when you buy a stock and hope that its price will rise over the next 5 years, 
you know exactly what a bond will be worth at its maturity date—that afore-
mentioned principal amount. Any difference between the purchase price and 
maturity face value is therefore part of your planned return.
Imagine that you bought a $1,000 face value bond for $900, with a maturity in 
exactly 4 years. This hypothetical bond pays a coupon of 3%. If you hold the 
bond for all 4 years until maturity, when you receive that $1,000 face value 
you will have earned a capital gain of $100 (the difference between the $1,000 
you receive at maturity and the $900 you paid for the bond), or $25 per year 
for each of those 4 years. You will also have received $30 per year ($1,000 x 3%) 
in interest payments, giving you an annualized total return of $55. When you 
divide $55 by your purchase price of $900, you can see that your annual yield 
to maturity is 6.1% per year.1

Chapter 5 | Investment Structure for Fixed Income, Part I
80
The $900 purchase price and $25 annual “accretion” in the price of the 
example bond is based on two factors. The first factor is the credit quality  
(an assessment of the likelihood that the bond issuer will default on the bond) 
of the issuer. Buyers of lower-rated bonds demand higher rates of return 
to compensate them for the higher probability of default. If our issuer is 
downgraded (i.e., at some point in time it is believed to have a higher chance  
of defaulting than was previously thought) by a ratings agency that is ­concerned 
that the issuer might go bankrupt, the price of the bond might fall immediately 
to $800, meaning that a buyer of this bond would now see a yield to maturity 
of 10.0% ($30 coupon plus $50 annual accretion equals $80 income/$800  
face value.).
The second factor in the price of our bond is the market interest rate. If the 
world is humming smoothly along and government bonds are yielding 3%, 
our imaginary corporate bond might yield the investor 4% or 5%, since inves-
tors will require a moderate amount of additional return above the prevailing 
treasury yield in order to compensate them for the risk of default, however 
remote it may be. If, on the other hand, inflation is starting to rise and the 
Federal Reserve cranks government rates up to 6% to prevent the economy 
from overheating, now our bond will have to yield 7% or 8% to reflect the 
fact that the entire interest rate world has moved toward higher rates. These 
higher rates are also necessary because investors will desire some incremen-
tal return above treasuries (called the “yield spread”) to compensate for the 
fact that their bond is carrying higher risk than treasury bonds are.
Because the coupon was set in stone when the bond was issued, the coupon 
can’t change when the world moves to higher interest rates; yet our bond 
needs to have a higher yield to keep pace with the rest of the bond market. 
The only aspect of the bond that can change, therefore, is the price, which will 
fall when rates rise to increase the amount of the annual “accretion” for a new 
buyer. Through a quirk of mathematics, the amount that the price of a bond

will rise or fall with a change in interest rates happens to be roughly equal to 
the duration of the bond!2 If a bond has a duration of 6 years, when rates rise 
by 1%, the price of the bond will fall by 6%. If rates fall by 0.5%, the price of 
the bond will rise by 3%.
2Again, duration is not absolutely precisely the amount that the price will change in reaction 
to a change in interest rates, especially for very large movements in rates; but it is close 
enough that duration is widely used as a very good approximation of price movement.
3A 2% rate movement in a portfolio with a duration of 10 years will lead to roughly a 20% 
capital loss, partly offset by the 5% received in coupon interest over the year.

This math also holds for portfolios of bonds, not just individual securities. If a 
given bond mutual fund has a published duration of 7 years for the entire port-
folio, the price of that mutual fund will rise or fall by roughly 7% in response 
to a 1% rate movement.
What Duration is Right for You?
When considering which bond fund you should buy, therefore, the duration 
of the fund matters as much as anything else. A fund called a short-term fund 
will generally have a duration of a year or less. A core or total return fund will 
typically have a duration that falls in the 4- to 6-year range. A long-term bond 
fund might have a duration in excess of 10 years. If rates rise 2% over the 
course of a year in an improving economy, and that long duration bond fund 
is paying 5% in interest a year, you could lose 15% over that year3, illustrating 
just how much risk duration really poses to the investor in a changing rate 
environment.

So, why invest in anything other than short-term bonds? Glad you asked. In 
most normal market environments, short-term investments have lousy returns 
compared to longer duration bonds. At the time of this writing, 1-year US gov-
ernment bonds are yielding 0.25%, 10-year bonds are yielding 2%, and 30-year 
bonds are yielding 3%. A given corporate issuer may see its 1-year debt trad-
ing at 0.50% above treasuries, but its 30-year bonds might have a spread above 
treasuries of 1.50%. An investor who thinks the economy is stable and isn’t 
afraid of interest rate movements might view that 30-year corporate bond 
returning 4.5% (3% treasury yield + 1.5% credit spread premium) to be a far 
better investment than the 1-year corporate bond at 1.5% (1% treasury yield 
+ 0.50% credit spread premium). Someone who is very concerned about ris-
ing rates or increased levels of default in the future, on the other hand, might 
consider the near certainty of the 1.5% return on short-term bonds to be far 
superior to the potential capital losses on longer-term bonds as rates rise, 
despite the higher yield for them. For a comparison of the yields on a 30-year 
Treasury bond and an AA corporate bond over time, see Figure 5-1.
The duration selection, therefore, is an incredibly important part of the con-
struction of your fixed income portfolio. When pension plans make the dura-
tion decision, they typically balance the design of their fixed income portfolios 
using many of the same criteria that individuals can use.
For example, do you need the money soon? If a pension plan is holding cash 
to meet near-term benefit payments or to keep some minimal level of liquid-
ity in the plan, short-term bonds are usually preferred. If you sold your house 
but planned to buy another one in the next 6 months, you would do the same 
thing and keep the duration very short term to avoid incurring large losses 
over that time frame.

On the other hand, does the money fund a long-term need? Pension plans that 
keep a portion of their assets in fixed income to balance their risk exposure in 
other asset classes may not draw on their fixed income investments for years 
and years. The duration of the liability of the benefit payments that the pen-
sion someday will owe could be 10 or 20 years down the road. Keeping that 
long-term view in mind, many pension plans will take advantage of the generally 
higher returns for longer duration bonds and live with the associated volatil-
ity. In the same way, if you plan to retire in 1 year, long duration might put too 
much of your assets at risk; but if you plan to retire in 25 years, have only a 10% 
allocation to fixed income, and can live with short- or medium-term volatility, 
then the benefits of longer duration bonds might outweigh the risks for you.
Do the potential returns of long duration investing really outweigh the risks? 
The examples that I have given so far have been based on a “normal” interest 
rate environment, as shown in Figure 5-2. This chart illustrates a typical rela-
tionship between bond yields and time, where investors who have short-term 
objectives demand relatively low rates and investors willing to invest in very 
long-term securities wish to be more highly rewarded for their risk.
Whereas Figure 5-2 shows the most common environment, there are times 
that the yield curve could be flat or even downward sloping. For example, as 
shown in Figure 5-3, when short-term rates are very high and the economy is 
starting to weaken, longer-term rates could be lower than short-term rates 
in anticipation of rate reductions by the Federal Reserve to stimulate a future

economic recovery. At these times, you could see yields of 5% for 1-year 
bonds and 4% for 30-year bonds and question the sanity of investing long 
term when long term means lower returns and higher risk. In these kinds of 
environments, pension plans will assess the relative merits of different dura-
tions and will normally shorten their durations to capture the higher return 
and lower risk nature of shorter duration investing, or they could anticipate 
significant large future rate increases and lengthen duration in order to profit 
from the upward movement in prices as rates fall.  Which path they choose 
depends entirely on how much risk they are willing to take on a macroeconomic 
outlook like this that could be wrong.

What does the economic outlook look like today? I rarely advocate “market 
timing” to our clients, and large pension plans usually do not attempt to time 
economic cycles by moving their portfolio positions dramatically. However, 
there are times when the market environment must be taken into consid-
eration. For most of the last 20 to 30 years, interest rates have been on a 
generally downward path, with a few notable exceptions, such as 1994. In 
the 1980s, 30-year bonds were yielding 8%, 10%, or even higher. In 2011 and 
2012, 30-year bonds generally yielded around 2.75% or 3%, with a brief trip 
during the worst of the European economic crisis down to 2.5%. Although 
30-year rates can still move lower and set new records below that 2.5% point, 
they generally cannot go below 0%. Practically speaking, 30-year rates, even in 
the worst crisis imaginable, probably cannot go below 1% or 2%. From their 
­current levels, that isn’t much of a fall.

Chapter 5 | Investment Structure for Fixed Income, Part I
86
On the other hand, although it is unlikely that bond rates will zoom upward on 
a moment’s notice, given the commitment of the Federal Reserve to keeping 
rates moderate for the foreseeable future, they CAN go much higher someday. 
For example, 30-year bond rates could rise to 7% or 8% under the right cir-
cumstances. As a result, the risks are not balanced. One does not stand to gain 
much from further rate declines but could lose a lot from rate increases. In this 
environment, pension plans who wish to remain long-term investors and will 
hold their bonds to maturity may want to take advantage of the higher yields 
on longer-term bonds and might decide that a long-term buy-and-hold strategy 
is appropriate, even if it causes medium-term losses, since the total gain over 
the entire time period makes the investment worthwhile. On the other hand, 
a fund that has more flexibility in its portfolio may want to consider the likeli-
hood that rates will rise and decide whether that possibility is worth the risk.
Given the greatly increased levels of perceived market risk since the credit 
crisis in 2008, as well as the apparent willingness of the Federal Reserve to 
take unprecedented steps to manipulate interest rates in a variety of markets 
and across all durations to manage risks throughout the economy, investors 
should be aware that the normal rules may not apply in the future and that the 
market interest rate may not react to economic ebbs and flows in the future 
as well as it has done in the past.
All of these factors that pension plans weigh in their decision-making pro-
cess need to be considered by individuals and then some. As I discussed in 
Chapter 2 when I discussed a long term view on asset allocation regardless 
of short-term market movements, when pension plans take a calculated risk 
that goes wrong, they have time on their side. Pensions can wait years or even 
decades for assets to return to fair value. They also have the backstop of the 
sponsoring company or public entity to contribute additional cash to make up 
for a shortfall when needed.
When an individual has a large loss, on the other hand, the individual will need to 
reduce retirement spending plans, work for more years than planned to make 
up for the loss in extra savings, or simply hope that the loss turns around over 
the remaining time horizon. Frankly, none of these are great options, and so the 
risk of market movements going against you when making a duration decision in 
fixed income, the asset class that most people consider to be their “safe store of 
value” or their risk reducer, need to be considered very, very carefully.
Credit Risk
The bond market is built from three very different and specific types of invest-
ments—unlike the stock market, which is comprised of the aggregation of a 
bunch of individual company risks.

Invest Like an Institution
87
The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is generally considered to be the 
broadest and most inclusive measure of the entire US investment-grade bond 
market. As of September 30, 2012, the Barclays Aggregate included more 
than $16.8 trillion in investment-grade fixed income securities4. Government 
bonds, including debt issued by the US Treasury and the direct debt of US gov-
ernment agencies, comprised 41% of the total index; corporate bonds consti-
tuted almost 27% of the index; mortgage-backed securities added 30% to the 
index; and other securities, like asset-backed securities and small amounts of 
some dollar-denominated foreign securities, made up the rest.
Unlike with stocks, these three main components of the index—government 
bonds, mortgage bonds, and corporate bonds—have unique risks associated 
with each of them, leading investment managers to “rotate” among these sec-
tors in different economic environments in ways that stocks managers can-
not. The simple explanation is that investment managers will buy corporate 
bonds (the debt of individual companies) and mortgage bonds (debt backed 
by the principal and interest payments of huge pools of homeowners) when 
the economy is improving or strong, since the low risk of default in these eco-
nomic environments means that the incremental yield of corporate and mort-
gage bonds generates outperformance. In contrast, they will buy government 
bonds (generally considered to be a default risk-free investment) in times of 
crisis to protect their principal, since the chances of default or bankruptcy 
by the US or other governments is far lower than it is for corporations or 
homeowners.
As you can see in Figure 5-4, which compares the returns of investment manag-
ers who buy only corporate securities to the broader Barclays U.S. Aggregate 
Index, corporate securities portfolios vastly outperform the broader bench-
mark the majority of the time, where 100% of managers are outperforming 
the benchmark, with exceptions during times of corporate stress, such as the 
credit crisis of 2008 where the index ranked around the 1st percentile, indicat-
ing that 99% of corporate bond managers underperformed the index. Looking 
closely at the chart, there are extended periods—like 1992–1997, 2003–2006, 
and 2011–present—where the Aggregate Index ranked right at the 100th per-
centile, meaning that 100% of corporate bond managers had results better than 
the index. During these time periods, anyone exposed to corporate securities, 
regardless of skill or luck, would have outperformed the benchmark.
If you ignore investment manager returns for a minute, you can see a similar 
result if you compare the returns of the Barclays Credit (Corporate Bond) 
Index to the Barclays Aggregate Index. Figure  5-5 plots the rolling 3-year 
outperformance/underperformance of the Barclays Credit Index versus the 
broader Barclays Aggregate Index since 1980.

Over this time period, the Credit Index appears to outperform the Aggregate 
Index very consistently, except during crises and recessions. In fact, as 
Figure 5-5 indicates, the average annual outperformance of credit securities is 
0.29% per year (0.57% median). If the first couple of years are discounted and 
recalculated from 1983 (remember, the very early 1980s were characterized 
by borderline runaway inflation and interest rates over 10%), the long-term 
average jumps to a 0.60% annual outperformance by corporate bonds over 
the broader index.
In Chapter 3, if you squinted hard enough, you might have been able to con-
vince yourself that the growth or value equity style outperforms the other 
style in certain environments, but you would have been hard-pressed to find 
any real consistency. In addition, when a given equity style cycle ends, the 
reversal is usually violent and quick. When it comes to the bond market, 
however, I think it is pretty clear that corporate bonds generally have outper-
formed the entire fixed income market pretty consistently—with the excep-
tion of the “credit crisis” of 2008. This is why the vast majority of pension 
plans and investment managers tend to have long-term systematic biases away 
from the index toward riskier securities. After all, if you have a very long-term 
view and can survive periods of stress, there really is a long-term performance 
advantage to sticking with corporate bonds.
As you consider which types of mutual funds you wish to include in your fixed 
income allocation, I urge you to follow advice that is very similar to the posi-
tion I took on duration earlier in this chapter. That is, if you have a long-term 
horizon, taking some credit risk can really pay off over the long run. If you have 
20 or 30 years until retirement, this small annual advantage really begins to 
add up! Figure 5-6 adds the Barclays Government Bond Index to this analysis 
and shows that a lower-risk portfolio of only government bonds would have 
had a steadier path than corporate bonds over time but far less total return.

If you had invested a single dollar in the Barclays U.S. Government Index on 
December 31, 1983, it would have grown to $8.68 by June 30, 2012 (before 
fees and expenses). A dollar invested in the Barclays Aggregate (which con-
tains government, mortgage, and corporate bonds) would have grown to 
$9.39, indicating the advantage of some broader diversification. However, 
showing the merits of taking even more risk, a dollar invested in the Barclays 
U.S. Credit Index would have grown to $11.09, or 6.7% growth over those  
28 1/2 years.
As was the case with the duration discussion, again, all of this shows the ben-
efits of taking reasonable risks over long periods of time. For those out there 
with a short time horizon, say, 5 years or less until retirement, this aggressive 
concentration in corporate bonds could be too much of a risk. Look back at 
the last two charts closely. If you had decided to heed my advice and invest 
in corporate bonds in 2006, your returns would have been horrible over 
the next few years as compared to someone who chose lower risk or more 
diversified assets.
This is precisely why pension plans manage their credit risk to fit their time 
horizon, just like they do with their duration risk. Short-term cash pools that 
are needed to pay benefits are invested in treasury bonds and extremely 
short duration, highly rated corporate bonds. On the other hand, long-term, 
strategic allocations to fixed income that may not be sold for many years seek 
the greater reward of corporate bonds. Although it is entirely possible that 
short-term risk may pay off quickly, never take on more risk than you can 
handle. If losses or market declines cannot be tolerated over the time horizon 
given, don’t take on risks that can lead to intolerable losses, no matter how 
appealing the potential returns might be.
Summary
Unlike in the equity markets, the risks in fixed income investing are easily 
quantifiable and can be quite manageable if they are understood. The dura-
tion and credit risk of a portfolio can be designed to precisely fit the timeline 
and risk appetite of the investor (or a mutual fund with characteristics that 
match the investor's preferences can be selected), minimizing the potential 
impact of a catastrophic market movement. Whereas the underlying invest-
ment strategies of any given manager may be difficult for the average individual 
to understand, it is easy to obtain the duration and average credit rating of any 
fixed income mutual fund through your bank’s or broker’s web site, the mutual 
fund company or its web site, or a data aggregator like Morningstar.com. Once 
you understand your duration needs and your personal willingness to take on 
credit risk, finding a suitable fund for you should be a fairly easy task.

Manager Selection Considerations
In this chapter, I will continue the discussion of how to determine the appro-
priate fixed income structure for individual investors, but I would like to 
change the focus from the characteristics of the underlying bonds to those 
of the managers themselves. As I discussed in Chapter 3, when I covered the 
basics of the investment structure for equities, a strong case can be made that 
a global outlook for stock investing is the best way to reduce risk and maxi-
mize your opportunity set for returns. Does the same rule of thumb apply to 
bonds? In Chapter 4, I contrasted the results of active and passive managers 
across a variety of equity portfolio types and found that there is a mixed bag 
when it comes to whether there is any consistent value to active manage-
ment among stock mutual funds. Are the results any clearer for bonds? Finally, 
whereas the discussion in Chapter 5 dealt mainly with traditional lower-risk, 
6
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 6 | Investment Structure for Fixed Income, Part II
94
investment-grade fixed income investments, what about other types of bonds, 
like high yield and emerging markets? Is there merit to considering these in the 
portfolio? To keep things interesting, I will answer the second question first.
Active versus Passive Management
In Chapter 3, I made a pretty strong case for why most pension plans invest a 
large fraction (sometimes even 100%) of their equity allocation in index funds 
and why individual investors should generally do the same. I will not repeat 
that advice here! Very simply put, in contrast to my thoughts about indexing 
stock investments, I am not a fan of indexing fixed income, and I know of very 
few pension plans that use index funds for bonds. Why? The answer is simple. 
Unlike in equities, where the sum of all market participants equals the stock 
market index, the sum of all fixed income funds does not equal the bond 
market index.
How is this possible? Unlike in equities, the fixed income industry has plenty 
of participants with different interests or guidelines than the average investor 
has, which thereby skews how funds are actually invested. Insurance compa-
nies, for example, largely invest in government and highly rated corporate 
bonds, typically disdaining mortgage bonds and anything rated below AA. 
Sovereign wealth funds, the national investment companies of countries with 
positive national trade flows, tend to buy mainly government bonds in the 
United States and maybe a few highly rated corporate bonds. Meanwhile, cen-
tral banks looking to manipulate exchange rates or manage international cash 
flows exclusively buy government bonds.
Lower rated corporate bonds and mortgage bonds are therefore more the 
domain of pension plans, investment managers, and retail investors. As a result, 
the sum of all the bond holdings of retail and pension plan investments looks 
nothing like the market as a whole. With insurance companies and sovereign 
wealth funds buying a disproportionate share of the government issuance, the 
investment funds that you and pension plans invest in will be heavily skewed 
toward the riskier corporate and mortgage bonds in most environments.
The question for you, the investor, then, is whether you are okay with that 
bias. Are you investing in fixed income for the perfect long-term safety of 
government bonds, or are you simply looking for a way to reduce and balance 
your stock market risk? If you are looking for the latter, then considering funds 
who take advantage of the long-term systematic outperformance (with the 
occasional major hiccup) of corporate and mortgage bonds over government 
bond returns is completely appropriate. Do you want a core or total return 
product that employs all sectors but usually underweights governments, or do 
you want to go full out and invest in a corporate-only portfolio?

Invest Like an Institution
95
The decision really boils down to what you view as the role of fixed income in 
your portfolio, your time horizon, and how well you can absorb the periodic 
corporate bond return collapses. As the charts in Chapter 5 have shown, 
anyone with a 10- or 20-year time horizon, or longer, would have done much 
better in a risky asset-biased portfolio over time, assuming they could have 
stomached the periods when corporate bonds and other risky assets fell 
off the proverbial cliff. Figure  6-1 compares the entire universe of institu-
tional, active core, fixed income portfolios (the fixed income asset manage-
ment products in which pension plans typically invest) against the Barclays 
Aggregate Index on a rolling 3-year basis. Here are the results, and they are 
rather shocking (at least to me).

Figure 6-1.  Performance of All Core Institutional Managers Versus Market Benchmark  
*Data courtesy of eVestment Alliance
As has been the case in similar charts earlier in this book, the index’s rank 
among the collection of available investment managers is indicated with the 
dots. If the index ranks at the 40% mark, for example, that would indicate that 
40% of investment managers outperformed the index for the 3 years up to 
that point in time and 60% performed worse than the index.
In Figure 6-1, with the exceptions of the recession of 1991 and the credit 
crisis of 2008, more than half of all fixed income investment managers have 
always outperformed the bond market as a whole. Contrast that to the same 
charts we reviewed for equity products in Chapter 3, where actively managed 
funds enjoyed good periods and bad periods but did not consistently out-
perform the benchmark. That isn’t the case here! Given the systematic bias  
by ­investment managers for riskier assets that outperform over the long run, 

Chapter 6 | Investment Structure for Fixed Income, Part II
96
as well as the ability of these managers to “rotate” among sectors during 
difficult market environments, I remain firmly convinced of the merits of 
investing all of a pension plan’s fixed income dollars in actively managed prod-
ucts. Unfortunately, though, the retail bond market is one place where it is 
more difficult for individual investors to precisely copy that advice. Whereas 
Figure 6-1 plotted the returns of institutional portfolios, Figure 6-2 compares 
the entire opportunity set of mutual funds (636) that fall under the Lipper 
“Intermediate Investment Grade” fixed income definition.

Figure 6-2.  Performance of All Core Mutual Funds Against Market Benchmark  
*Data courtesy of eVestment Alliance
What happened to our great performance? Figure  6-2 would imply that  
individual investors should never invest in active fixed income portfolios 
because our odds of outperforming the benchmark seem to be so slight, 
directly contradicting the advice I would give to institutional pension plans 
based on Figure 6-1.
Remember that Figure  6-2 shows the results of mutual funds, whereas 
Figure  6-1 showed the results of institutional products that are available 
exclusively to very large investors like pension plans. There are a number of 
differences between mutual funds and institutional products that decrease  
the consistency of outperformance, but I do not think that they negate my 
predilection toward actively managed products.

97
Why? First, the mutual fund return data reflects the effect of fees, whereas the 
institutional return data typically does not. This difference by itself will move 
the index up a little in the rankings because index returns never reflect the 
impact of fees and expenses.
Second, institutional investment portfolios tend to be very tightly defined 
and controlled. Core fixed income portfolios are all benchmarked against the 
Barclays Aggregate, contain very little unwanted cash, and aim for roughly a 
market duration. Mutual funds, in contrast, need to keep a decent amount of 
cash available in the portfolio to supply liquidity for clients entering and leaving 
the funds. Mutual funds also are typically less well defined. If you read through 
the list of the 636 funds represented in Figure 6-2, there are lots and lots and 
lots of funds with “intermediate” in their names (implying shorter-than-mar-
ket duration), an income focus (instead of a total-return focus, meaning that 
all they invest in is yield, not capital gains or sector rotation opportunities), 
sector-focused funds, and many other things that dilute the purity of this pool.
So, let’s pull all of this together. In Figure 6-3, I have selected 10 total return-
style fixed income funds from managers who tend to rule the roost. Even 
though I won’t provide their individual names to avoid the appearance of 
endorsing any of these funds, rest assured that I’m not cherry-picking perfor-
mance here. If you saw me on the street and asked me to rattle off the top 
of my head the “best” (most consistent, best resourced, most respected, etc.) 
fixed income managers without referencing a table of their performance, this 
is the list I would come up with.

Looks a little better, right? For most of the 1990s, the index underper-
formed every single fund on my list. Performance got a little tougher during 
the NASDAQ collapse and then came back strong in the middle part of the 
last decade. Not unexpectedly, the credit crisis didn’t do wonders for my list 
of managers, since they tend to overweight riskier corporate and mortgage 
bonds, but they have all come back great, with the index again ranking dead 
last over the past year. I will cover manager selection in the next chapter, but 
it sure looks like there are some pretty great managers out there that can 
outperform in most decent market environments.
Now, I know what you’re thinking. Yeah, yeah, these look good, but they’re not 
perfect. That performance spike or two is still really scary. Maybe we should 
give an index manager another look, and so I do in Figure 6-4.

Performance Relative to Index
Figure 6-4.  Performance of a Bond Index Mutual Fund Versus Index  
*Data courtesy of eVestment Alliance
Figure 6-4 contains the full history of rolling 3-year returns versus the index 
for a major fixed income index fund. What is plotted is the rolling 3-year 
outperformance or underperformance versus the benchmark, regardless of 
market direction. If you compare this chart to the manager’s returns for its 
S&P 500 index fund, which track the benchmark so closely they are virtually 
indistinguishable without resorting to a microscopic scale, you would think 
that this was an actively managed product. Given that the Barclays Aggregate 
Index has 7,999 securities in it,1 and some are highly illiquid, the portfolio

manager simply cannot buy a pro rata share of every security like you would 
for an index fund. Instead, a statistical sampling process is used as well as a 
small procorporate, antigovernment security bias to offset the impact of man-
agement fees. This slight deviation from an exact copy of the index results in 
a very slight increase of the yield in the portfolio.
Figure 6-4 shows that there may not be a perfect or even simple solution for 
individual investors. My list of dream managers in Figure 6-3 missed pretty 
badly a couple of times, but the index fund didn’t fare a whole lot better. 
When recessions and crises hit, the fear of default rises. When default fears 
rise, yields and yield spreads rise, causing the prices of bonds to fall. Although 
having more credit exposure than the benchmark seems to lead to outperfor-
mance over long periods of time, as I showed in Chapter 5, there will always 
be short periods of time when credit quality fears impact these portfolios 
worse than others that have more exposure in less risky securities.
So, I know you really want to ask me who is on that list in Figure  6-3!! 
Have your city or state pension plan call me to solicit a bid, and I will let  
them know.
“Plus” Sectors
The “plus” sectors in fixed income are really some of my very favorite things 
to recommend to clients. High yield and emerging markets debt are the most 
common of the “pluses,” with some small consideration given to a variety of 
other obscure investment types, like securitized bank loans. Although some 
of the rarer kinds of fixed income investments could be very relevant to a 
large pension plan, I will focus here on high yield and emerging markets debt 
because they constitute the vast majority of the “plus” sectors and are com-
monly available for investment in most core-plus funds as well as in individual 
portfolios dedicated to the asset type.
“Core” portfolios and the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index contain ­domestic 
investment-grade bonds, or bonds rated no worse than BBB–. “Core-plus” 
portfolios and “plus sector” investors therefore invest in things that simply 
are not in that 7,999-member list of securities that Barclays uses to build 
the U.S. Aggregate Bond Index,2 mainly because emerging markets debt are 
not US securities and high yield bonds are, by definition, NOT investment 
grade. Instead, both emerging markets debt and high yield bonds are viewed 
by many, many investors as big, bad, scary demons that are not safe to invest 
in. Chinese, Russian, and South American debt? Scary! These countries default 
on their debts from time to time or may have weakly enforced rules of law.

High yield companies on the verge of default after falling from grace, or start-
ups that have issued total debt equal to many times their annual revenues? 
These can be even scarier, which is one of the reasons why you might want to 
hire professionals to navigate these waters for you.
Here’s the thing, though: everyone knows the risk of each of these types of 
securities, and everyone wants to get paid for the risk. I won’t go into all the 
math and confusing charts, but the basic truth is that the incremental yield 
over treasuries offered by these perceived-to-be terribly scary bonds more 
than compensates the investor for the historical default rates and bankruptcy 
recoveries experienced by investors in these asset classes.
Howard Marks, the chairman of a widely respected high yield investment man-
ager, has a mantra that he repeats in many of his letters to clients, articles, 
public speeches, and books: high yield investing is like amateur tennis. Whereas 
a pro like Roger Federer will win a match by hitting unreturnable shots, the 
amateur tennis player wins by simply getting the ball back over the net. If I, 
very much an amateur tennis player, make fewer unforced errors than you, 
I will win the game. The same is true in high yield investing. We don’t need 
to make tremendous gains on individual securities like we would strive to do 
in an equity portfolio. All we need to do is make fewer errors (select fewer 
bonds that default) than the index, and we will outperform over time.3 If you 
combine an asset class that overpays for default risk with managers who can 
mitigate the damage done by the worst bonds issued, hopefully this can lead 
to a long-term source of superior gains.

the Barclays Credit Index, and the Citibank High Yield Cash Pay Index since 
the inception of the Citibank Index in December 1988.

The path is lumpy, but clear. High yield bonds have steadily outperformed 
both the broad investment-grade market and their investment-grade corpo-
rate brethren, except for those nasty bumps the chart seems to have hit in 
2000–2002 and 2008. As I discussed in Chapter 5, investment-grade corpo-
rate bonds will outperform over long periods of time but experience nega-
tive shocks when the economy sours. Because high yield bonds are nothing 
more than higher-returning and more-volatile versions of corporate bonds, 
Figure 6-5 illustrates that both the long-term success rate is better and the 
impact of those shocks are greater. As I said in Chapter 5, these types of secu-
rities may be appropriate for an investor with a long-term time horizon who 
can ride out those short-term negative periods but should not be considered 
by someone who lacks the time or patience to allow the market to recover 
when it falls.
Figure 6-6 takes this discussion of corporate and high yield bonds a bit further 
with an “apples-to-oranges” comparison that still illustrates the point of the 
binary nature of high yield versus the broader market. In this chart, I have 
plotted the rolling 3-year returns of the core Barclays Aggregate Bond Index 
against the distribution of all high yield managers.

*Data courtesy of eVestment Alliance
Not surprisingly, Figure 6-6 shows that high yield is either the hero or the goat, 
depending on the economic cycle. When times are good and default rates  
are coming down, the entire population of high yield investment ­managers

103
outperforms investment grade fixed income, with the investment-grade index 
ranking at the 100th percentile, the absolute bottom. On the other hand, 
when the economy has hit a rough patch, like the recessions of 1991, 2000, 
and 2008, 100% of high yield managers underperform the broader market and 
the index ranks in the 1st percentile.
Taken together, these two charts leave me with the following conclusion: over 
long periods of time, high yield bonds will outperform the rest of the bond 
market but in a very choppy pattern. As a result, clients should pick one of the 
following two strategies for investing in high yield bonds, depending on their 
desired level of risk:
1.	 The Asset Allocation Approach: Invest for the long run, 
setting a steady and separate/dedicated allocation to 
high yield and living through the volatility in exchange for 
superior long-term results.
2.	 The Manager Approach: Invest the fixed income alloca-
tion in products with names like “Full Discretion,” “Full 
Authority,” or “Core Plus,” where the investment man-
ager is allowed to invest in high yield and other sectors as 
it sees fit, rotating the portfolio into and out of high yield 
as events warrant.
If you have a large amount of assets and want to select specific specialists 
in high yield, then the first strategy is appropriate, using periods of poor 
high yield performance to increase your investment with these managers 
in a bottom-picking, dollar-cost-averaging manner. If you would rather just 
trust professionals to do it for you, then an investment in more aggressive 
core-plus fixed income portfolios will get you the exposure you need. Either 
way, the long-term benefits of adding a moderate amount of high yield to 
your portfolio are clear, with superior long-term results for those that can 
stomach the risks.
Another common “plus” sector that pension plans include in their portfolios 
is emerging markets debt. This is the debt issued by lower-rated countries, 
like those in South America, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia. Historically, 
emerging markets debt has been considered a more risky type of investment 
than investment-grade debt because many of the emerging markets countries 
have had crises that impact investors on a regular basis. These crises have 
included currency crises (like Mexico in the mid-1990s), economic collapses  
(the “Asian Tigers” in the late 1990s, many parts of Mediterranean Europe from  
2008 to present), sovereign defaults (Russia in 1998), and re-nationalizations of 
assets (Venezuela about every 20 minutes). However, despite these periodic  
crises and considerable problems with governance and investor protections, 
the returns still look awfully good.

Chapter 6 | Investment Structure for Fixed Income, Part II

As shown in both Figure 6-7 (a chart of cumulative performance since the 
mid-1990s) and Figure 6-8 (a chart of rolling performance over a medium-
term period), since the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index was created 
in December 1993, it has vastly outperformed all types of US investment-
grade and high yield bonds, in spite of all those aforementioned crises,  
collapses, and other issues. In fact, the last 20 years have seen a steady prog-
ress toward stability in the emerging markets. If one compares national debt 
to GDP or looks at trade balances, many emerging markets are now in a 
financially stronger position than the so-called First World. Some of these 
countries, like Russia, have even been redefined as investment grade, despite 
their very recent default history. (After all, 14 years really isn’t that long ago 
in the memory of economists.) The continued migration of emerging markets 
economies into the developed world will continue with economic growth, 
but the debt issued by these countries has already had a tremendous track 
record. As a result, it is my opinion that this strong history argues for including 
emerging markets debt in the broader fixed income portfolios you select—
but it probably does not merit a separate allocation to this asset class. As was 
the case with high yield bonds for investors who may not have the stomach 
for short-term volatility or large losses in a crisis, let your core-plus manager 
choose when and where to invest in emerging markets debt.
After all, I’m not absolutely convinced that this historical outperformance will 
continue forever, which is why I would rather trust the decision to include 
or exclude it from a core-plus portfolio to experts. If the trend shown in 
Figure 6-7 continues, you will profit from an allocation to emerging markets 
debt. However, the last 5 years shown in Figure 6-8 indicate that the rate of 
outperformance by emerging markets debt has significantly slowed. If that 
long-term positive trend stops once all markets are priced about the same, a 
broadly diversified investment manager will be able to redirect your invest-
ment dollars elsewhere.

Should an Individual Invest in the US or Global 
Fixed Income Market?
When I meet with clients and we discuss the prospects for stock markets 
and economies, I am frequently asked to discuss how this or that economic  
factor or risk might affect their equity investments. As I outlined in Chapter 3,  
investing in US stocks really isn’t a perfect proxy for investing in the United 
States anymore, given the foreign exposure of so many companies. A terrible 
economic meltdown that somehow affected the United States and only the 
United States (impossible, I know, but bear with me here) would not neces-
sarily destroy the earnings or stock price of Apple or Coca-Cola or count-
less other companies that have significant non-US operations. Simply put, an 
investment in US stocks is not a pure investment in the US economy.
In contrast, when you buy US Government debt, you have 100% exposure to 
the United States. Consumer preferences in Germany or tax cuts in Australia 
have absolutely no impact on the probability that you will earn a return on 
those US bonds. US Government bonds depend 100% on the performance 
of the US government. Mortgage bonds depend 100% on US homeowners. 
Corporate bonds might pay part of their interest from foreign earnings, but 
the underlying rate regime that drives their total returns will flow directly from 
the government bond rate curve. In short, if you want to express an opinion 
on an individual country and its economy, fixed income—not stocks—is the 
place an investor can actually do it.
However, I do not normally recommend a separate allocation for non-US 
fixed income as a necessity for all investors, like I did for equities. In Chapter 4,  
I made a strong argument for why investors should think of stocks as global 
stocks and eliminate the “home country” bias that results from overallocation 
to the stocks of their native lands. That same logic, however, does not hold 
for fixed income.
The global investment-grade bond market is very different from the stock 
market. Whereas US, German, and Japanese automobile companies compete 
in a global marketplace for retail buyers, the US, German, and Japanese govern-
ments do not compete head to head, per se. US Treasury Bonds set the global 
baseline for all investments. Just as US corporate bonds or high yield bonds 
will be priced based on the “yield spread” (the incremental return demanded 
by investors to compensate for default risk) above Treasuries, so too will the 
bonds of other nations and their companies. Low-risk government bonds 
issued by countries like Germany and Britain will be priced to yield levels that 
are very similar to US government bonds, whereas risky countries like Greece 
or Italy will be priced to yield far more due to the possibility of default—not 
because Italy is a superior investment.

Chapter 6 | Investment Structure for Fixed Income, Part II
108
Although the sales, revenue, and profits of BMW could far outpace those of 
GM, thereby generating a much better appreciation in BMW’s stock than GM’s, 
German bonds will return basically the same to investors as US Government 
bonds over any reasonable time period. There are thousands of hedge funds, 
investment banks, and portfolio managers who trade in these securities and 
will buy the cheaper bonds and sell the more expensive bonds at any given 
time, keeping the prices and yields basically in line.
As a result, there are very small gains, if any, to be made from investing in 
bonds issued outside the United States or your home market. My advice to 
most of my clients for non-US investment-grade debt is very similar to my 
advice for high yield and emerging markets debt: allow your portfolio manager 
to invest in non-US bonds as he or she sees fit, but don’t bother to seek out a 
separate portfolio for just non-US bonds. Except for cases of extremely large 
clients with massive economies of scale, or someone who wishes to increase 
or decrease the exposure to the dollar or other currencies on purpose to 
find some other source of returns, the benefits of any incremental yield may 
not outweigh the time and expense of finding and monitoring non-US fixed 
income funds.
Individual investors who wish to profit from the small differences between 
these markets should select mutual funds that are allowed to invest outside 
the United States in some moderate amount when the portfolio manager 
believes doing so is appropriate. A separate allocation to non-US bond funds 
is simply overkill given the limited opportunity that exists for gains. It may 
even hurt your performance when that static, non-US allocation is impacted 
by a crisis or other event that causes global capital to flow directly into US 
markets for security.
Summary
Bonds are, in many respects, a more direct investment in the real outcomes 
of a company’s activities than are stocks. A company could double its sales 
but still see its stock price fall if a competitor triples its sales. For the bond 
investor, though, that doubling of sales will better insure that the company can 
pay back the money it has borrowed through the issuance of those bonds that 
the investor holds. Regardless of how the stock market wishes to view one 
company versus another, the bond market presents the clearest way to invest 
in a company’s real balance sheet and long-term prospects. One can think 
of stocks as an investment in the hope of tomorrow, whereas bonds are an 
investment in the reality of today.
Before you determine the appropriate structure for your fixed income invest-
ments, you need to consider why you are investing in fixed income in the 
first place. If you are buying bonds to preserve principal and generate current

of short-term losses, including reducing duration and credit exposure. On the 
other hand, a long-term investor with many years until retirement can survive 
through periods of underperformance in exchange for the prospect of bet-
ter returns when times are good. For this reason, long-term investors should 
explore the value that can be provided over the long term from the credit risk 
of corporate and high yield debt above and beyond long-risk treasury bonds.
Although the tendency by many investors is to simply view bonds as the low-
risk balancing counterweight to the high-risk equity positions in their port-
folio, I have shown in this chapter and in Chapter 5 that there is far more to 
fixed income than meets the eye. Duration decisions can result in great gains 
and losses as rates rise and fall with the economic cycle. Meanwhile, decisions 
about how much credit risk you can bear and which plus sectors you wish to 
include in your portfolio can result in returns that can rival stocks in many 
environments.

By this point in time, you should have a solid understanding of equity and 
fixed income structure under your belt. You also should have determined 
how much you should invest in each of the types of assets you are willing to 
consider and have worked out your plan for how to structure each asset class 
to minimize risk from unwanted biases and fees from active managers in asset 
classes where you have little hope of adding value. Now it is time to discuss 
the process of selecting money managers that will put your money to work in 
the markets; so you take another step on your path toward financial success, 
leaving the structure decisions behind and focusing your energy on selecting 
investment managers who will add value into your portfolio.

Selecting, reviewing, terminating, and replacing money managers is what the 
trustees of many pension plans or endowments spend 95% of their time doing. 
Your allocation of time and energy probably will not be that much different. 
However, even though this is the most time-intensive part of the entire invest-
ment process, it can also be the fun part—not to mention the part with the 
most obvious immediate impact. Investment enthusiasts love to spend their 
time poring over the quarterly or annual rankings of fund performance in the 
Wall Street Journal or Money Magazine. Some participants in 401(k) or 457 plans 
offered by corporations or public agencies drive investment committees crazy 
with requests for their favorite funds to be added to the plan options. And 
many investors love to join in the cocktail party chatter about how much bet-
ter or worse than the market they are doing and how it is all thanks to some 
obscure mutual fund recommended to them by their dentist’s brother-in-law’s 
accountant (or something along those lines).
However, when it comes to determining whether you will retire with assets 
sufficient to your needs, manager selection is the part of the investment pro-
cess that matters the least. Remember from Chapter 2 that asset allocation 
drives more than 90% of the variation in returns from investor to investor and 
from Chapter 3 that investment structure determines at least another 5% of 
your returns. Manager selection is really just the icing on the cake.
One of the best pieces of investment advice I can give to clients comes from 
an equity trader at an investment bank where I used to work. He used to tell 
me that when it comes to picking individual stocks, “If you outperform the 
market 50% of the time, your investments are average. If you beat the market 
55% of the time, you are great. Win 60% of the time, and you are the best 
that’s ever been. That’s how thin the margin is between average and fantastic.” 
I would argue that while we might hope to have a slightly more successful 
lineup of mutual funds in our portfolio, we should never expect that 100% 
of them will always beat the market because the individual security selection 
that makes such an important impact on mutual fund returns is so hard to do 
consistently. Frankly, if more than half of our mutual funds are outperform-
ing for a given period of time and the fund selections are adding value to the 
portfolio in total, even after accounting for the underperforming funds and 
fees, we have done our job well.

113
Invest Like an Institution
These lowered expectations should guide your decisions for evaluating funds. 
In a properly diversified portfolio, you might have eight investments. Let’s say 
you’re invested in three US large and small cap stock funds, a core bond fund, 
a high yield fund, a non-US stock fund, an emerging markets fund, and a com-
mercial real estate fund or real estate investment trust (REIT) fund (for more 
information on real estate and REITs, refer to Chapter 8). You might have a 
year where seven or eight of those funds are doing great, and you might have 
years where all eight underperform the market. However, over your 50-year 
investment horizon, you will most likely be able to look back and see that you 
basically earned the market return, or maybe a little better or worse, for the 
whole time on average.
Why is this?
Most major markets are generally believed to be “information efficient.” The 
efficient markets theory, developed by Professor Gene Fama at the University 
of Chicago, presumes that all the information available about an asset is already 
incorporated into that asset’s price, so no one can outperform the market 
due to “superior information” unless they have access to insider information 
(which is illegal).1 Take a stock like General Electric, one of the oldest and 
largest companies in the world, as an example. Dozens of research analysts 
at Wall Street banks monitor every news item and earnings report with the 
scrutiny of a forensic detective. Hundreds or maybe even thousands of ana-
lysts at money management firms, mutual funds, and hedge funds do the same. 
Hundreds of thousands of individuals are invested in the stock.
What are the odds that out of all of those people, Joe Smith fund manager 
has superior information and knows more than all the others and is able to 
add value on the basis of it? Pretty small. The efficient markets theory says 
that any publicly available information is reflected in the price of the stock 
almost immediately because all investors have access to it and draw conclu-
sions from it. The same is true for Exxon, Microsoft, AT&T, and all the rest 
of the stocks listed on the S&P 500. The odds that any one analyst has some 
piece of legal information that is truly unique are low. If you consider that the 
average mutual fund has 100 or 150 holdings in it, superior information on 
a single stock wouldn’t make a lot of difference anyway. The fund manager 
would need to have unique and superior information on a dozen or more 
stocks, every day, to consistently add value based just on information. In the 
incredibly competitive environment that is the financial markets, that’s a pretty 
hard assumption to make—and quite often it is just not realistic.
1The “strong form” of the efficient markets theory holds that even insider information is 
incorporated into the stock price.

Chapter 7 | Investment Manager Selection

In their book, Active Portfolio Management, Richard Grinold and Ronald Kahn2 
proposed the following model for categorizing the world of money manag-
ers. Let’s assume for a second that you can break down investment managers 
in two ways: each is either Lucky or Unlucky and Skilled or Unskilled. We’ll 
assume that, contrary to the efficient markets theory discussion previously, 
there actually is such a thing as skill when it comes to picking stocks. We’ll 
also assume that skill can add some value to an investment, even in a relatively 
efficient market.
Each manager, therefore, can be placed into one of the four open spaces in 
Table 7-1, and four distinct personality types can result, as seen in Table 7-2.

Lucky
Unlucky
Skilled
Unskilled
Table 7-2. The Four Resulting Types of Investment Managers
Lucky
Unlucky

Blessed
Forlorn
Unskilled
Insufferable
Unemployed3
The adage, “It is better to be lucky than good,” can apply to at least a quarter 
of the population in this analysis. I’ll go through each of these categories in 
detail to help you understand how to pick the right manager of your invest-
ment funds.
The Blessed Money Manager
I’ll start with the group of money managers that we all want to hire: the 
Blessed Money Managers. Trustees of, and consultants to, pension plans and 
endowments spend, as a group, millions of hours a year trying to find the 
managers that are most likely to deliver stellar future returns. Investment 
consulting firms hire armies of analysts that are tasked with sending out and

Controlling Risk, Second Edition, Richard C. Grinold and Ronald N. Kahn, McGraw Hill, 2000.
3Grinold and Kahn referred to combination of the Unlucky and Unskilled as “Doomed,” 
but I prefer to jump right to the end and think of them as the “Unemployed.”

scoring questionnaires or requests for proposals from managers; meeting with 
managers; critiquing their people, resources, organizations, and investment  
philosophies; and then ranking the managers in an effort to develop lists of 
recommendations for clients for the future. Entire industries exist of database 
vendors that create software for slicing and dicing performance and holdings a 
million different ways to try to determine with any kind of statistical certainty 
if a series of great results was truly due to skill or luck. Trustees, consultants, 
and money management marketers then fly around the world to meet in the 
world’s most expensive dating process to convince each other that they are 
meant to be together.
At the end of the process, every client hopes that these Blessed managers 
truly are as skilled as their slick promotional materials seem to imply and that 
their glorious past results persist forever.
The Forlorn Money Manager
At the end of the day, though, luck can change. As great as a manager might 
appear on paper, sometimes they just get it wrong—even if they have a team 
of MBAs from top schools building models based on data collected by 200 
research analysts, each with 10+ years of experience, and are willing to invest 
whatever is required to have the best tools in the industry. Or, maybe their 
style falls out of favor with the industry for a few years, where the deep value 
stocks that they love to discover stay ignored (and depressed in price) by the 
rest of the market. Whatever the case may be, these types of firms fall into 
the Forlorn category. They know they are doing everything right. They have 
torn apart and rebuilt their processes a dozen times. They have held dozens 
of internal meetings and hired plenty of outside advisors to try and figure out 
what is going wrong, and yet the downward slide continues.
Forlorn Money Managers make consultants, including myself, lose sleep. There 
is brilliance there, and a consultant can tell clients over and over again to be 
patient, but there is always the question of whether or not patience and bril-
liance will pay off in the end. Managers in this camp are like the baseball player 
that falls into a 2-month slump after three great seasons. Is it just a slump? 
Will the past brilliance return? Maybe something changed. Maybe they actu-
ally don’t have skill. Maybe they were simply lucky for years and were great at 
convincing people that their good luck was actually the embodiment of skill. 
Regardless of the reason, these managers are the main reason that picking 
future sources of outperformance is more of an art than a science.
Of course, I do have a few clients that will invest with these Forlorn firms from 
time to time, and their willingness to invest with someone at the bottom of 
the cycle has paid off in some cases. (Bear in mind that it is entirely possible 

Chapter 7 | Investment Manager Selection
116
that poor results can continue indefinitely, so don’t take this example of bot-
tom picking as a guaranteed source of great performance.) If you have faith in 
the manager’s investment process but their performance is poor, maybe their 
process or philosophy is out of favor for the moment and is due for a return. 
If they like stocks with good R&D investment, for example, and the world has 
spent the last year bidding up the prices of companies that are cost cutters, 
perhaps this manager will come back strongly when the market starts to 
reward companies that are investing in the future.
The Insufferable Money Manager
Back to the baseball analogy. If those first three great seasons were actu-
ally just the result of luck and the player was never really any good in the 
first place, then the manager falls into Grinold and Kahn’s next category: the 
Insufferable Money Manager. This group drives consultants crazy. You meet 
with them and listen to their story and see their results, but you just know 
something doesn’t add up. They simply aren’t that good. Their market-beating 
performance makes no sense. They lack the resources of the Blessed and 
Forlorn Money Managers. Their people aren’t as experienced or impressive, 
they don’t have as sophisticated a trading and database system, and they don’t 
have the same depth of research resources.
What they do have, however, is an impressive track record and the most annoy-
ing team of marketing people on the planet. They trumpet their results from 
the rooftops, cold-call your clients, and harass you at conferences. Investment 
consultants can’t figure out how they generate the results that they do, and 
clients resist them for years and years and years until a naïve consultant finally 
gives in, perhaps because they want the harassment to stop, and hires them 
anyway. But then, the Insufferable Money Manager’s true lack of skill inevitably 
shows up when their good luck runs its course and they become part of the 
next category: the Unemployed Money Manager.
The Unemployed Money Manager
Unemployed Money Managers are not unemployed originally, of course, but 
they become that way over time. The firm’s string of luck cannot carry on 
forever, and eventually its lack of skill becomes apparent. Clients may hang on 
to the fund for a few years, hoping that the past was prologue and believing 
that the good years are just around the corner—and in some cases, the man-
ager’s luck does return. However, most of the time their results get worse, 
asset levels fall, clients move on, and the manager begins to struggle to stay in 
business.

Applying Manager Performance to Your 
Investments
What does this mean for the average individual investor? Someone with a 
$10,000 portfolio certainly cannot command a meeting with a portfolio man-
ager in the same way that a pension plan with $100,000,000 to invest in 
the strategy can. If it is hard enough for pension plans and endowments and 
investment consultants with unlimited access and tremendous resources to 
determine luck and skill, separating the Blessed from the Insufferable, how can 
the individual investor have any idea if they are picking the real winners?
Here are my rules of thumb:
1.	 Ignore overnight successes. I’d take a manager who has 
outperformed the market in 16 of the last 20 years but 
has stumbled the past 2 years over a sexy new manager 
with 3 highflying years any day. Statistically, there is a 1 
in 8 chance that a new firm can beat the market during 
its first 3 years out of the box.4 The odds that its string 
of successes continues—if those successes are indeed 
based just on luck—get longer every year.
2.	 Beware of Endpoint Bias. The problem with the rank-
ings of top mutual funds in papers or magazines is that 
the criteria used to compile the list is always based on 
performance for the 1 year or 3 years or 5 years preced-
ing the publication date. This tells you nothing about the 
fund’s chances of long-term success. A manager with 4 
lousy years and 1 utterly amazing year could generate 
a good 5-year number, despite a disappointing perfor-
mance 80% of the time. Instead, investors need to look at 
the manager’s 1-year returns from inception onward—
or, better yet, its rolling 3-year returns from inception 
onward. How many of those periods have outperformed 
the index? Long-term consistency is a far better indicator 
of future success than just a recent snapshot of success. 
Because this point is so crucial to selection, I’ll go into 
more detail when I discuss the pitfalls of Endpoint Bias 
later in this chapter.
4I’m assuming a 50/50 chance you randomly pick a portfolio that beats the market. 
Consider that 1/2 cubed is 1/8. If you throw in transactions costs and fees, the odds of a 
3-year good string fall to maybe 1 in 9 or 1 in 10, which is certainly not an impossible feat 
given that hundreds of new firms or products launch each year. If 200 new funds launch 
this year, even odds of 1 in 10 mean that 20 of those could outperform the index in the 
first 3 years purely by luck.

Chapter 7 | Investment Manager Selection
118
3.	 Take a look at other portfolios within the same firm. How 
have they done? In most firms, research analysts are a 
shared resource. The analyst who covers the telecom-
munications sector gives the same information to the 
large cap growth portfolio manager as she does to the 
small cap value portfolio manager. If the portfolio that 
interests you is an outstanding star in a sea of mediocrity, 
something doesn’t add up. If the research resources can’t 
add value anywhere else, why is that particular fund doing 
so well? Maybe the portfolio manager is an utter genius, 
but the portfolio manager’s results still rest on the shoul-
ders of the research done by the analysts, which appears 
to have some issues in the other portfolios. Some firms 
make a point of advertising their success rates, such as 13 
out of their 15 funds have beaten their Lipper peer group 
(these are performance rankings of all funds in a given 
fund category by Lipper, a division of Thomson Reuters) 
for the last 5 years. Although I have plenty of bad things 
to say about peer comparisons as a benchmark of success 
later in this chapter, a success rate like that, where the 
vast majority of the firm’s products have similarly good 
results relative to peers—coupled with long tenures of 
key people with good, long-term track records—implies 
a far higher probability of continued success across the 
investment management company’s product line.
4.	 Stick with firms that have the resources to cover the sec-
tor in question. Some asset classes, like non-US stocks or 
corporate bonds, require huge resource platforms. How 
can five people sitting in New York have a better chance 
of generating strong performance in a global portfolio 
than a competitor that has 300 analysts stationed in the 
regions they research? Make sure the firm’s resources are 
up to the task at hand. In addition, look for teams and firms 
with low analyst turnover and long tenures of portfolio 
managers. The longer a team has worked together, the 
more they trust each other and the more they are pre-
pared to weather the bad times together. Ignore the new 
guy with three analysts and a firm you have never heard 
of. When performance turns down, the new guys have 
no client loyalty, no employee loyalty, and little chance of 
surviving intact.

119
Invest Like an Institution
5.	 Ignore the firms whose employees are frequent guests on 
CNBC (unless the firm happens to have trillions of dollars in 
assets and that employee’s words really do move markets).  
If you see a portfolio manager from a firm you have never 
heard of once a week on one of those “stock advice” 
shows where people call in and ask the “experts” what 
they think of this or that individual company, ask yourself 
these questions:
1.	 Doesn’t he have anything better to do? If his portfo-
lio is based on intensive research, being on national 
television every morning may distract him. Perhaps 
the fund should spend less time developing a public 
persona and more time researching the stocks in my 
portfolio.
2.	 Why is he giving his ideas away? Proprietary research 
is normally not free. The ideas might be stocks that 
the portfolio already owns and the manager is trying 
to build up some excitement for them by talking them 
up in public. Or, in the worst-case scenario, he really 
is giving away the results of his company’s research to 
build his reputation.
Believe in the manager’s investment philosophy. Many people are fans of 
Warren Buffett because he makes a point of saying that he invests in what 
he knows. As Mr. Buffett commonly says, seeing lines out the door of a given 
store is a better argument for the potential returns that company can gener-
ate than all the Excel spreadsheets of financial projections ever produced.  
Mr. Buffett, then, serves as the quintessential example of an investment  
manager who believes in the value of strong fundamental research.
Another type of investment manager you might consider could have a thematic 
style, for example, where the portfolio manager develops a handful of macro-
economic themes with the help of economists or analysts tasked with think-
ing 5 years down the road. Some common themes are the graying of America 
(medical services, retirement communities, cruise lines) and the greening of 
America (recycling, sustainable products, renewable energy, organic foods). 
The manager then tries to pinpoint the overall trend within each theme and 
buys a handful of either best-of-breed or next-generation companies, depend-
ing on whether that manager has a bias toward established large cap compa-
nies or small cap startups. A third philosophy could be buying growth stocks 
at a reasonable price by avoiding the real high fliers and instead looking for 
companies that offer comparable technology and sales growth—but without 
the markup in stock price that the industry’s publicity leader might get.

Chapter 7 | Investment Manager Selection
120
As you can see in the examples given, none of these themes are revolutionary, 
but they do guide the manager’s thinking. The point of any of these is that as 
long as you understand and believe in the manager’s philosophy, you will be 
more likely to tolerate periods of underperformance when that philosophy 
goes out of style for a year or two. If you understand, believe in, and agree 
with how the portfolio manager picks stocks, you might be able to avoid the 
tendency to move on to a new fund just before things pick up again.
Endpoint Bias Case Study
The easiest way to underperform and lose money in the financial markets 
is to pick funds based on their most recent endpoint. Figure 7-1 shows how 
two real funds compare to the entire population of core bond funds as of  
March 31, 2009, on a 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year basis. The boxes denote the break-
down of all peers by quartiles. The top-most box contains the results for the 
top 25% of all funds, the second top-most box contains the 25th to 50th per-
centiles, and so on. The top and bottom 10% of the distribution are truncated 
from the graph to prevent absurd outliers from distorting the entire picture.
As of the date in question, which fund would you pick? The fund denoted by 
the small dot has 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year performance near—or even above—
the top of the distribution, indicating that its results have been in the top 10% 
or better of all core bond funds over any time period. The small square rep-
resents a fund from another company that has been well within the bottom 
10% of all core bond funds over all time periods displayed.
Making a decision about which manager to hire or fire based on Figure 7-1 
illustrates what I refer to as Endpoint Bias. That is, a fund looks terrific or 
horrible based on its performance over some number of months or years up 
to a given point in time. Given procurement rules and minimum qualifications 
for bidders, Endpoint Bias is actually how many institutional investors are 
required by law to find and hire investment managers. The plan requires that 
all candidates perform above the benchmark through some given date. Then, 
human nature being what it is, the individuals searching for an investment 
manager typically select one of the managers that looks the best over the 
recent past under the assumption that the trend will continue.

As an individual investor, however, you can pick whomever you want to with-
out fear of being sued for violating some procurement law. And, in this case, 
picking and choosing whoever you want would serve you well. What do I 
mean by that? Take a look at Figure 7-2, which plots the two managers’ results 
in a different way, showing their results above or below the benchmark on 
a rolling 3-year basis. The chart for each manager begins at the inception of 
the investment fund and extends through the worst of the 2008 credit crisis. 
When the line representing each manager pulls above the gray horizontal line, 
this indicates that the manager was outperforming the Barclays Aggregate 
Bond Index. Meanwhile, when the line representing each manager falls below 
the zero line, this indicates that the manager was underperforming.
The scenario in Figure 7-2 paints a significantly different picture from that 
shown in Figure  7-1. As it turns out, our underperforming manager from 
Figure 7-1 has had a pretty great track record from its inception right up 
to the beginning of the credit crisis in 2008. Over its 16-year rolling history 
prior to the credit crisis, this manager never underperformed the benchmark. 
Clearly, something went wrong with the portfolio when the credit crisis hit, 
but a 16-for-16-year track record of outperformance up to that point should 
count for something, shouldn’t it? Maybe this manager has more skill than that 
prior universe chart implied in Figure 7-1. In contrast, take a look at our great 
manager from Figure 7-1. From their (more recent) inception of 1999 through 
late 2008 (also beware of my admonition earlier against funds with shorter 
track records), this manager has been decidedly mediocre. Their performance 
was briefly decent relative to the benchmark in 2002, but for most of their 
history this manager basically delivered index-like returns to their clients.
Which analysis do you trust for selecting where to invest your money? The 
most recent end point data or the entire body of work? Many people invest 
with the manager that looks great today, based on that data ending point, 
instead of the one who looks great over the course of its entire history.  
As you probably could have guessed by now, I would recommend choosing the 
entire body of work as the basis for your assessment rather than succumbing 
to the Endpoint Bias that results from looking at a brief snapshot in time.
If an investor were to choose one of these two money managers to invest 
with in early 2009, I certainly hope that he or she would have ignored the most 
recent data and invested with the terrible-looking manager from Figure 7-1. 
After all, 2008 was the worst year for fixed income since the Great Depression, 
and any manager with credit risk in its portfolio (see Chapters 5 and 6 for 
more detail) would have had terrible returns over that year. Investing in credit 
securities at the expense of an allocation to government bonds was an invest-
ment philosophy that had worked for years and years, but it was radically out 
of favor in early 2009. However, as Figure 7-3 demonstrates, it turns out that 
credit securities actually presented a fantastic opportunity.

As you can see in Figure 7-3, the underperforming manager from Figure 7-1 
came roaring back from the bottom in 2008 to deliver phenomenal perfor-
mance in 2010 and beyond. In contrast, the manager who looked good in 
early 2009 for the first time in its history returned to mediocrity in 2011. 
Although every advertisement for mutual funds on TV and in print always says 
that past performance is not a guarantee of future results, it certainly can be 
a rough indication of what possibilities the future might hold. In the example 
in Figure 7-3, a fund that had looked great for almost two decades hit a rough 
patch and then returned to greatness, whereas one that had never done much 
of anything briefly outperformed its peers and returned to obscurity.
How do you avoid the tendency to let yourself be governed by Endpoint Bias? 
After all, most individual investors do not have access to databases and charts. 
But guess what? Although they are fantastic for really getting into the weeds 
for analyzing returns, you don’t need all those fancy tools for a quick approxi-
mation of this kind of review. All you need are three highlighters: green, yel-
low, and red. When you are interested in a fund, go to the fund’s web site, 
the prospectus, or some general industry web site like Morningstar.com and 
find the fund’s year-by-year performance versus the benchmark. Then, look at 
the results year by year, highlighting outperformance by the manager in green, 
underperformance in red, and a rough tie in yellow. Table 7-3 contains two 
hypothetical examples.

As you can see, Fund B has much better endpoint results than Fund A does 
and has generated very solid results in the last three years of this series. 
According to this data, which would be easily accessible on the Internet, Fund 
B’s outperformance during the last 3 years was better than the benchmark—
and it was better by a greater magnitude than Fund A’s outperformance. If you 
were making your decision based on the 3-year number as of Year 10, Fund 
B would be your selection. However, if I were choosing a fund to invest my 
retirement in, I would choose Fund A. Fund A outperformed by less than Fund 
B recently, granted, but it outperformed 70% of the time versus only 40% for 
Fund B. Maybe something has changed and Fund B is suddenly the best in the 
business, but I would rather rely on the long-term successful track record of 
Fund A for managing my assets.

Remember, you can’t go back in time and buy last year’s results. All you can do 
is identify funds with the higher long-term batting average and hope that the 
consistency of success persists.
Peer Comparisons
As I mentioned previously, it is very common to hear a television advertise-
ment for a mutual fund company say something like, “80% of our funds beat 
the Lipper Peer Group Average for the last 5 years.” When they say that, my 
mental response is always, “So what? The average fund isn’t the only alterna-
tive to yours.” Although I will explain at length the reasons for my disdain 
of peer comparisons later on in this chapter, I can make this advice really 
simple: ignore peer comparisons, especially when they do not include the 
index results.
A peer group comparison (see Figure 7-1 and Figure 7-4 for examples) is a 
database ranking of the returns of every available fund of a given type or in 
a specified asset class over certain periods in time, with the fund in question 
highlighted. Look back at Figure 7-1. The shaded boxes reflect the returns of 
every core bond fund in the industry lumped together into a demonstration 
of the size of the distribution, whereas the dots show how the two funds in 
the discussion and the index compared to that population. When someone 
says that a fund beat the peer group average, it means that the fund is in the 
top 50% of all the funds in its type. In this example, it means that the dot  
representing the fund’s return would be higher than the median.

127
Invest Like an Institution
Peer group comparisons, although interesting, have three major problems 
associated with them and should not be used as the sole basis for investment 
decision making. First, peer groups disseminated in the popular press or on 
the web are almost always generated as of a single point in time, resulting in 
the aforementioned Endpoint Bias. Second, the peer group isn’t a homog-
enous universe of funds that have a similar construction, risk profile, or turn-
over level. Concentrated, high-risk, large capitalization core equity managers 
with 20 stocks are in the same peer group as large cap core enhanced index 
managers with 300 stocks. If a fund beats its peers because the portfolio man-
ager took more risk and the market went up, what happens when the market 
goes down? The fact that the managers outperformed their peer group tells 
me absolutely nothing about how the manager outperformed their peers—or, 
more importantly, how much risk they took to generate those results. Third, 
and this is the most important point in my mind, what about the return for the 
index? An index fund or ETF is the real alternative to selecting a given actively

managed fund. If no one can beat the index, why do I want to pay active man-
agement fees in the first place, no matter how good my selected fund looks 
compared to the other underperforming options?
Figure 7-4 is an example of a fund (the round dot) that outperformed its peer 
group median for two time periods, ranking in the top 41% of all funds for the  
prior year and the top 31% for the last 3 years. This is a perfect example of 
one of those funds that “outperformed the Lipper peer group median.” The 
index, however, ranked in the top 21% for the last year and the top 13% for 
the last 3 years and ranked roughly 20 percentage points better than the sup-
posedly superior fund did. Although it is nice that the fund did better than 
its peers, you could have been invested in an index fund that performed even 
better and paid a lot less money in expenses and fees.
This is why no pension plan takes peer comparisons for individual investment 
managers seriously as the sole basis for fund selection. The alternative to a 
given fund isn’t the peer group; it’s the index that investors can get virtually for 
free by investing in an index fund with a very low manager fee. When manag-
ers start saying in their commercials that their fund has outperformed both 
the Lipper Peer Group average and the index every year for the last 10 years, 
then I will start to consider making more use of peer comparisons. I need to 
know that the fund has consistently been a better choice than BOTH most 
other funds and the index fund over long periods of time to make it worthy 
of consideration for investment.
The Secret to Selecting Managers for  
your Money
Because peer comparisons and endpoint results are not good criteria for 
selecting managers, how should individual investors select them? I will give 
the same advice here as I did for how to build a successful, long-term asset 
allocation plan that works for you: consistency, consistency, consistency, 
consistency—consistent track record, consistent people, consistent ­philosophy, 
and consistent organization.
Consistency of Track Record
As outlined previously in this chapter, investors need to be aware of Endpoint 
Bias and focus on consistency. A manager that outperformed the benchmark 
in 10 of the last 12 years, with all else being equal, is a far better choice than a 
manager who has looked good only for the last 3 years. While history does not 
guarantee the future, the odds are far greater that an investment manager who 
has had relatively good results for a long time will have a better chance of future 
success than will one who has done fantastically well for just the last two years.

129
Invest Like an Institution
Consistency of People
Most mutual fund web sites will list the tenure of the portfolio manager and 
other key staff. This is incredibly important information because the track 
record of any investment product is 100% dependent on the people who built 
it. If a fund has a great 20-year history but everyone who built that history 
retired 2 years ago and the team is new, that fund really has a 2-year track 
record. Anything before that can be credited to someone else and should be 
ignored in your analysis.
Consistency of Philosophy
This one is the hardest to determine but also the least likely to change.  
If an organization has built its reputation around well-researched, diversified, 
risk-controlled stock portfolios and then shifts to a new line of products that 
offers highly concentrated portfolios with high turnover, look somewhere else 
to invest your money. When a manager’s investment philosophy changes, their 
track record should be discarded. Anything prior to the new philosophy was 
generated in a different manner and has no bearing on the possible returns 
you might experience.
Consistency of Organization
There are generally two kinds of investment management companies in the 
world: dedicated firms and afterthoughts. Dedicated firms may be partner-
ships, publicly traded companies, family-owned companies, or part of a par-
ent company. Regardless, they are alike in that they devote 100% of their 
time, energy, and resources to generating investment returns for their clients. 
Afterthoughts, on the other hand, is my nickname for investment management 
firms that comprise 1% of the income statement of a commercial bank, insur-
ance company, or industrial conglomerate. In most cases, these firms do not 
control their own destiny and are frequently under pressure to deliver sales 
or revenue targets to their parent companies that have little to do with the 
market environment or the needs of their clients.
The organizations with which you should invest should demonstrate a long-
standing and stable commitment to investment management and the resources 
needed to provide solid returns to their clients. All too often, the afterthought 
organizations are forced to reduce staff when the market gets tough to deliver 
financial results—which is exactly the time when more resources are needed 
to seek out opportunities in a difficult market.

Summary
An April 2012 white paper by Wilshire Consulting5 detailed just how difficult 
it can be to find managers that outperform the benchmark year after year. 
Among large capitalization core equities managers, for example, only 15% of 
those managers who ranked in the top quartile for the three-year period 
between 2006 and 2008 remained in the top quartile for the subsequent 
three-year period between 2009 and 2011. If there was evidence that the best 
managers always rise to the top, we would expect to see half or more of those 
that had done well in the first survey remain among this top group in the 
second time period. A completely random distribution would result in 25% 
remaining in the top quartile from three-year period to three-year period. 
Instead, that 15% result demonstrates how incredibly difficult it can be to 
deliver top performance year after year because 85% of those that were able 
to rise to the top for one 3-year period were unable to stay in the group for 
the next period. This survey is conducted on an annual basis across a variety 
of asset classes, and while the results may vary slightly from year to year, they 
don’t change very much. As such, it is highly unlikely that managers operating 
within any asset class (with the possible exception of asset classes like emerg-
ing markets stocks and high yield bonds, where the spread of information is 
considered to be very inefficient) to remain in the top group year after year 
after year.
Investors cannot expect to get perfect results every year. The process or 
investment philosophy that any particular money manager uses to select the 
companies in which it invests can very well come in and out of favor in dif-
ferent market environments. Periods of great performance can be followed 
by periods of poor performance, and the worst-performing managers in the 
industry can suddenly jump back to life when their style comes into favor and 
their results leap up the rankings table.
Consistent outperformance of the market is a difficult endeavor, and find-
ing mutual fund managers that outperform the market every single year is 
not realistic. An investor looking to guarantee a long-term investment for a 
comfortable retirement should focus on selecting investment portfolios that 
have delivered above-benchmark performance for a long period of time in 
aggregate. When you do this, you will be well ahead of the game and should 
consider yourself a sound investor who has done your homework.

Alternative 
Asset Classes
Going Beyond Stocks and Bonds
Alternative investments are generally the biggest differentiator between the 
asset allocation mixes of institutional investors, like pension plans or endow-
ments, and individual investors. Whereas a major university endowment might 
have 50% or more of its portfolio invested with private equity managers or 
hedge funds, the average person normally does not have access to these kinds 
of investments in a typical 401(k) plan.
If you choose to invest in alternative asset classes, you are making an asset 
allocation decision. However, because your ability to invest in alternative asset 
classes is highly reliant on who you chose as an investment manager, you are 
also making an investment manager selection decision. As a result, I have high-
lighted both the Asset Allocation and Investment Manager Selection boxes in 
the recurring Road Map to Financial Success to help you visualize how to 
think about these investments.

Chapter 8 | Alternative Asset Classes
132
In this chapter, I cover what alternative investments are, if and how they should 
be included in your asset allocation plan, and how an individual investor can 
participate in these kinds of investments.
What Are “Alternatives”?
What are these “alternatives” anyway? Alternative investments is a broad label 
for pretty much any asset that is not a plain old stock or bond. Some people 
might have a broader or narrower definition of a few types of assets, and they 
may exclude real estate investment trusts (REITs) or commodities from the list 
of alternatives. For the sake of organization, however, I will include all of these 
types of alternative investments in this chapter to keep them all in one place.
Broadly speaking, alternatives can be lumped into four major categories:
1.	 Private equity, including leveraged buyouts, distressed 
debt, and venture capital
2.	 Real assets, including real estate, infrastructure, and, for 
the purposes of this book, REIT stocks
3.	 Hedge funds
4.	 Commodities
Many of these types of assets, including private equity, most real estate and 
infrastructure funds, and hedge funds, are available to investors by invitation 
only. These investments are typically structured as limited partnerships, as 
opposed to, say, publicly available mutual funds. As a result, they carry signifi-
cant legal restrictions and typically require that an investor have a sufficiently 
high income or net worth before qualifying as an “accredited investor.” Even 
those who do qualify as accredited investors still need to be allowed into 
the limited partnership by the general partner. Without fantastic personal 
connections, that is a high wall to breach by most people. In addition, most 
of these investments are created with a preplanned fund size in mind and are 
either explicitly capped in the partnership documents (private equity and real 
estate) or implicitly intended to be so by the portfolio manager (hedge funds). 
The general partners or portfolio managers for private equity partnerships, 
real estate funds, and hedge funds then control who is allowed to “subscribe” 
or “commit capital” to their funds.
As a result of these limitations of fund size and the requirement to be invited 
to invest, the most successful and desirable funds are simply unavailable to the 
vast majority of clients, regardless of who they are. A private equity firm like 
Kleiner Perkins, the original source of funding for many of Silicon Valley’s most 
successful companies, has not added a major new partner since its first fund.  

Invest Like an Institution
133
If the firm wanted to, it could open its doors to new clients and see immediate 
inflows of five times (maybe 100 times) as much money as it currently invests. 
Because the firm would have trouble finding places to invest that much money 
and could be unable to repeat their historical success rate, however, they limit 
the fund to a manageable size and select only the investors that they want 
to have as partners—those investors that have been there since the begin-
ning. Many other top tier venture capital funds can tell a similar story—their 
success in the past and their desire to limit their funds to a manageable size 
makes it very difficult to gain access to this asset class. In many cases, new 
potential investors, if any were admitted, would need to prove to the general 
partner what benefit they bring to the table (advice, prestige, relationships) as 
a limited partner to displace some other long-term client. If your last name is 
Gates, Ellison, or Zuckerberg, you might have a chance of joining the party and 
investing in the next fund. For the rest of us, though, we would likely need to 
find some other way to gain exposure to these asset classes, such as investing 
with lower tier funds or trying to replicate the returns of the asset classes in 
other ways, as I will discuss later.
Over the last few years, a number of firms have begun to offer mutual funds 
that invest in some of these alternative investments. While these funds enable 
individual investors to indirectly invest in alternative assets, I have yet to see 
any information that indicates that these products perform much better than 
the asset class as a whole. In many cases, when you invest in these funds, you 
are essentially buying something like an index fund that captures the return of 
the asset class. Keep in mind, then, that your investment will not ­necessarily 
benefit from a tremendous amount of outperformance due to manager 
skill. For those considering investing in these types of funds to gain broader 
asset class exposure, I urge you to pay close attention to the analyses that 
­follow, where I try to determine whether there is really anything to gain from 
­achieving only the asset class median return in alternative assets.
Private Equity
While “equity” and “stock” investments are made up of portfolios of publicly 
traded securities that can be bought on a stock exchange through a broker, 
“private equity” is a catch-all term for investments in companies that are not 
publicly held. These types of investments come in three general flavors.
Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)
LBOs, also known as just “buyouts” because “leverage” is thought to be a four-
letter word by some, constitute more than 80% of the private equity industry. 
In this type of investment, a private equity fund (or a group of funds that pool 

Chapter 8 | Alternative Asset Classes
134
their capital and work together) purchases a publicly traded company that is 
either underpriced or underperforming and in need of restructuring. Part of 
the money to pay for the purchase comes from the invested capital from cli-
ents in the fund(s), and part (usually most) comes from new debt issued to pay 
for the deal. As the company’s balance sheet and income statement improve 
over time, cash flow from operations is used to pay off the debt bit by bit, 
making the remaining equity more valuable.
Let’s say a company with a $3 billion market capitalization is having trouble. 
Its employees are unmotivated, its CEO is failing, its products need refresh-
ing, and inventory is building up. On the plus side, it has a recognizable name 
brand in the consumer market and a huge number of great patents. Now 
let’s say Buyout Fund XYZ looks at the company and sees its potential, so it 
announces an offer to buy all the stock in the company at a premium price of 
$4 billion to reduce resistance against selling by current stockholders. To raise 
the $4 billion, Buyout Fund XYZ takes $1.5 billion from the capital invested in 
the fund by clients and issues $2.5 billion in new debt. It then brings in a new 
management team, replaces the board, reinvests in product growth, and hopes 
for a turnaround.
Over the next few years, improving operations generate enough cash flow to 
pay down $1 billion of the debt, and the advice and industry network pro-
vided by the buyout firm helps the company come back to life. After a few 
years, Buyout Fund XYZ sells the company or reissues public stock in the 
amount of $7.5 billion, reflecting the tremendous improvement in the com-
pany’s operations and potential. The investment of $1.5 billion in cash from 
the fund is now worth five times that initial amount. On the flip side, suppose 
the company does not make a dramatic turnaround. In this case, Buyout Fund 
XYZ shuts the company down; sells off its inventory, fixed assets, and patent 
portfolio for $2 billion; and defaults on the debt. For $1.5 billion invested, the 
fund gets back $2 billion. Some of that $2 billion might need to go to bond-
holders, but the buyout firms often structure the deals so that profits and 
management fees will flow to them throughout the restructuring and the debt 
has little recourse in the event of failure, resulting in a hefty profit even when 
the buyout doesn’t work as planned.
Not a bad business model. It reminds me of the old “heads I win, tails you 
lose” game I played with my brother when he was 2. Although not quite every 
deal works out with a profit like I just outlined, win or lose, the success rate of 
private equity firms is awfully high. Protections for bond holders in the event 
of default have improved in recent years, and the fire sale of assets when a deal 
goes bad doesn’t always cover costs. Overall, however, this isn’t a bad business 
to be in if you like to buy houses that have an elevator for your cars.

Venture Capital (VC)
Venture capital is the type of investment that most people associate with the 
concept of private equity. Venture capital funds often serve a critical function 
in the life cycle of a company because they provide money to early or middle-
stage companies in exchange for a share of the equity in the firm. This money 
often helps a new company move from the “idea phase” of its development 
cycle to the prototyping or launch phase. In addition, venture capital funds also 
typically provide other services to the companies in which they invest. Many 
funds, for example, connect the companies with seasoned executives to help 
them transition into maturity. Others may supply contacts with companies in 
affiliated industries with which they can work to grow their businesses and 
network. Some even offer to help the founders cash in on the value of their 
company by managing either the company’s initial public offering or its out-
right sale to a strategic buyer.
Typically, venture capital funds focus on the technology, medical device, or 
telecommunications sectors; and the classic examples of companies that were 
assisted in their early growth populate the lists of the most successful start-
ups of the last few decades. As a result, it should come as no surprise that 
Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Cisco Systems, Yahoo!, and Oracle—as 
well as high-profile failures like Pets.com, GeoCities, WebVan, and Kozmo—all 
received a substantial portion of their early funding from venture capitalists. 
However, venture capitalists aren’t always spot-on with their investments; 
beyond those I just listed, there were a large number of late 1990s NASDAQ 
bubble companies that were backed by venture capital and yet ceased to exist 
by the time 2003 rolled around.
Despite the abundance of household-name companies that have been backed 
by venture capital, these types of funds generally make up 10% or less of the 
private equity market and, as mentioned above, are extremely difficult for 
new clients to invest in. After all, the team managing the venture capital fund 
doesn’t want to invest in an endless number of companies because it will be 
unable to help each of them with their management strategies and business 
plans if its portfolio is spread too thinly. A typical number of investments by 
a venture capital fund might be 25 start-up companies, with an expected suc-
cess rate far below that of the buyout firms. Of those 25 investments, venture 
capital funds typically hope that one or two might turn into wild successes, 
three to five will generate a moderate return, and fewer than the remaining 20 
will muddle along unsuccessfully for years—or fail outright.
The investment a venture capital fund makes in any one company will be 
rather small, maybe $10 million to $50 million, because a new start-up isn’t 
trying to build a massive factory or supply chain and usually doesn’t need 
the billions of dollars that a candidate for investment by a buyout firm might 
require. Rather, it wants to either prove that a concept or product works in 

Chapter 8 | Alternative Asset Classes
136
practice before selling it or launch a new service that requires money only for 
the first round of employees and computers. As a result, whereas a buyout 
fund might have a portfolio of multibillion equity positions in each of several 
companies, yielding a total fund size of $10 billion or more, a venture capital 
fund may invest an average of $20 million in 25 companies, requiring the fund 
to raise no more than $500 million—which it can easily do just by tapping its 
happy investors from prior funds.
Mezzanine and Distressed Investments
Mezzanine and distressed investments are often overlooked in the realm of 
private equity strategies. So, what does the process of investing in these two 
investment vehicles really look like? Let’s start with mezzanine investments.
Mezzanine investors provide a middle step between venture capital funds and 
an initial public offering or sale of a company. Once a start-up, with the help 
of venture capital money, has proven that its product works and has lined 
up customers, it might need a large infusion of cash to ramp up production. 
However, given the still-young nature of the company, it might not be able to 
find a bank willing to give it a large loan, in which case a mezzanine fund will 
step in and provide a far larger amount of money than the venture capital fund 
did. The mezzanine fund will supply this money either as a high-interest loan 
or in exchange for equity in the company, and it will expect a return on the 
investment higher than the interest rate the bank would have charged on a 
similar loan to a more established company. The fund’s expected return, how-
ever, will be far lower than that expected by a venture capital fund because 
the odds of failure are so much lower now than when the company was just 
getting started. As a result, the terms investors can demand from companies 
in need of capital may not be as generous as those that a venture capital fund 
can obtain.
Meanwhile, a distressed investment fund provides a similar kind of service to 
companies that a mezzanine fund does, but it works with a very different kind 
of company. A firm that has come on hard times—whether through misman-
agement, competitive pressures, or a variety of other circumstances—but isn’t 
a great candidate for a buyout fund may need a large infusion of cash to turn 
its operations around and get back on the right track. Maybe the company is 
largely held by a few stockholders and can resist the takeover efforts a buyout 
firm would mount, or perhaps the management team is key to all operations 
and vision and cannot be easily replaced. Whatever the case may be, like with 
the mezzanine fund, the distressed investor will provide cash in exchange 
for an equity stake or interest payments that again fall between what a bank 
would charge and what a venture capital fund hopes to earn.

The fraction of the private equity market that falls under the definition of 
these two kinds of funds tends to ebb and flow with the economic cycle and 
the boom and bust nature of some industries. However, distressed and mezza-
nine investors generally do not comprise more than 10% to 20% of the entire 
private equity opportunity set.
Why Do Pension Funds Invest in Private Equity?
When private equity investments work, they generate fantastic returns. 
Imagine being one of the first investors in Apple or Microsoft or Google. 
Estimates vary, but most economists and academic studies tend to show that 
private equity investing over a long period of time, like a complete economic 
cycle, should be expected to generate returns that are 3% to 5% better than 
the public stock market—and that is just on average. The best private equity 
investors return far better than that.
I have seen numerous studies from a variety of sources that show the “dis-
persion” between top and bottom investors in a variety of asset classes. One 
such chart is shown in Figure  8-1. In this chart, the performance of each 
investment manager in the entire population of similar managers in an asset 
class is plotted to show how large or small the distribution is for active man-
agers’ outperformance or underperformance relative to the index for that 
asset class. For core fixed income portfolios, for example, Figure 8-1 shows 
that the difference between bond managers in the 25th percentile and those 
in the 75th percentile (the width of the middle two of the four segments in 
the chart) might be 1% over a market cycle, a very tight spread of outcomes 
that indicates there are not large differences among them. For large cap core 
equity investors, that performance gap between good (25th percentile) and 
poor (75th percentile) has been around 8%, a wider spread that indicates that 
success at picking active managers can have a significant impact on returns, yet 
that performance difference will still likely be dwarfed by the broader returns 
of the public equity markets, which can often be up or down 20% in a year. For 
private equity investors, however, the gap between 25th and 75th percentiles 
has been far wider—around 15%—whereas the difference between the very 
best and the very worst private equity managers (the entire width of all four 
segments) is 45% per year, indicating that the impact of good or bad manager 
selection can often overwhelm the impacts of the market returns and can be 
the single largest driver of an investor’s total return.

Every client I have ever worked with that invests in private equity wants 
to be a “top quartile” investor and reap the superior returns shown by the 
best-performing funds in that far-right bar in Figure 8-1. Many clients even 
have that goal specifically delineated in their governing policy documents. Of 
course, only in Lake Wobegone can everyone be above average, and so three-
quarters of all dollars invested in private equity will, by definition, miss that 
top quartile. Given the long-term, illiquid, and opaque nature of private equity 
investments, however, it can often be unclear how many investments really do 
miss this mark.
Private equity managers (and some clients) repeat the mantra of that top-
quartile goal and will discuss at length the investments they have made that 
have generated great successes. Meanwhile, those investments that detract 
from overall performance will be dismissed as “early stage,” having “poten-
tial,” or “will generate improved returns as valuations warrant.” No one ever 
wants to acknowledge that three out of four private equity funds will miss 
that top quartile and that almost half of all private equity investments will 
do about the same as, or worse than, public equities. If a fund invests in a 
company that generates a return of ten times the invested capital but loses 
money on every other investment, the fund as a whole will lose money. Still, 
the manager will trumpet the fact that they were an early investor in that 
successful company for the next decade. Such is the allure of the asset class, 
and the hope that every fund that invests in private equities can be among 
those top performers that new assets continue to flow into private equity 
year after year.

Simple math indicates that even those institutional and individual investors 
with real insight into which firms will outperform the rest of the pack will have 
trouble maintaining that “top quartile” status. According to private equity 
manager Preqin,1 private equity funds have raised an average of a little less 
than $300 billion a year over the last few years. The “Top Quartile Funds,” 
assuming you could identify them with precision, therefore have raised less 
than $75 billion a year. In the United States there are 134 state pension plans 
(some states have more than one) with more than $2.5 trillion in assets. 
If the average plan has a 10% allocation to private equity and spreads that 
investment over four years, those state plans are investing $62 billion per 
year, which amounts to virtually the entire top quartile of investments. Now 
add in the hundreds of billions of dollars poured into private equity funds 
by university endowments, very high net worth individuals, city and county 
pension plans, corporate pension plans, and foreign pools of money including 
sovereign wealth funds, and it is clear that the total of all the investments by 
sophisticated investors in private equity clearly overwhelms the opportunities 
presented by top quartile funds.
For investors who are not certain that they can obtain access to funds that 
are guaranteed to be in that mythical top quartile of great performers, or for 
those who lack the ability to qualify as an accredited investor for investment 
in any fund, the question remains whether the inability to invest in private 
equity as a whole will have a negative impact on performance versus those 
investors, like large pension plans and endowments, that are able to make such 
investments. In Figure 8-2, I show the performance of the entire buyout mar-
ket against some stock indices that might be considered to be a proxy for this 
type of asset to determine if there is another way of gaining a similar return 
stream for those without access to the best private equity funds—or even to 
private equity funds in general.

When I produced Figure 8-2, I was shocked. The solid line in this chart com-
bines on a capital-weighted basis the quarter-by-quarter results of a vast uni-
verse of buyout funds, culminating in more than $435 billion in assets by the 
final data point. On a rolling one-year basis, I’ve compared that performance 
history to the rolling one-year performance of the Wilshire 5000 stock index 
and the Wilshire Large Growth stock index. Because buyouts are a fairly new 
asset class and have a limited history, because they were created in the 1980s, 
the first few years of this chart do not tell us much. However, since the late 
1990s, it is clear that the average investor in buyout funds is not getting what 
they pay for. The after-fee results track the two stock market indices closely 
enough that I consider this to be pretty clear evidence that the entire buyout 
industry as a whole may not produce any value above a passive stock index 
return. As Figure 8-1 showed, whereas there is a clear performance advantage 
to investing in top quartile funds, investors who are not able to access the 
top-performing funds may earn nothing more than the public equity returns.
Given that buyout funds charge huge fees for the results they produce, if you 
are getting average returns on your investments in these funds, you are far 
better off just skipping the asset class entirely and investing your money in 
public equities. Yes, everyone expects that private equity should have a return 
premium over public equities, and the top funds certainly have added value for 
those clients who have access to them, as was shown in Figure 8-1. However, 
as Figure 8-2 illustrates, the market for buyout funds as a whole looks just 
like the market for ordinary stocks. Furthermore, given both the huge spread 
between the performance of the 25th and 75th percentiles that was shown 
in Figure 8-1 and the fact that the average return looks like the stock market, 
anyone who is getting below-average results would be significantly better off 
investing in an index fund of publicly traded stocks.
This is not meant to be an indictment of private equity in general, or buyouts 
in particular, for the large institutional investors who pursue these opportuni-
ties. After all, they very well may have a chance of finding and investing in those 
top funds that have results far better than those shown in Figure 8-2, and the 
long-term results earned by many large pension plans and college endow-
ments certainly indicate that there is value to be had in the best investments. 
However, for individual investors who cannot access those top buyout funds, 
and, at best, might be able to find their way into a second- or third-tier fund, 
the evidence that anything but the best investments in this asset class have 
merit is far less than compelling.

Figure 8-3 shows a similarly constructed four quarter, rolling return series for 
venture capital funds, which were comprised of a high of $145 billion in total 
assets a few years ago. I was as surprised by this chart as I was by the result in 
Figure 8-2, and I will draw the same conclusion here as I did for buyout funds: 
There is no discernible difference between the returns for the average ven-
ture capital fund and a public equity index (in this case, a small capitalization 
growth stock benchmark). Yes, the public benchmark is more volatile than 
the venture capital industry returns, but the good performing peak times for 
stocks are better and the long-term trends are very similar.

These sector exposures, which are widely available in index funds, ETFs, or 
actively managed sector mutual funds, track the venture capital industry-wide 
return data as well as, or maybe even a little better than, the small cap growth 
index. As was the case with buyout funds, if you cannot find your way into 
one of the most sought-after venture capital funds, it appears that there is no 
reason to go with the second best, as it is doubtful that you will get anything 
better than just a public stock market return.
Most economists and consulting firms estimate that the private equity indus-
try on average should return somewhere in the neighborhood of 3% to 5% 
above public equities, but the previous charts show some pretty convincing 
evidence that the average fund has not delivered results anywhere near that 
level for more than a decade. Although there are certainly some very high-
profile college endowments and public pension plans that make large invest-
ments into private equity and then tout their superior results in the press, 
there are plenty who have also stuck a toe in the water and been disappointed 
with the results.
In short, whereas the average investor cannot get broad access to the same 
set of opportunities that the largest public pension plans can and may find 
himself or herself unable to invest in a variety of private equity funds, this 
might not be a bad thing because the returns of the private equity industry 

Chapter 8 | Alternative Asset Classes
144
as a whole do not appear to deliver the consistent added value above public 
stocks that should be expected. Instead, individual investors can save money 
and find far lower fee alternatives to these highly illiquid asset classes without 
negatively impacting their results.
To be clear, this does not mean that no one should invest in buyouts, venture 
capital, or any other form of private equity. There certainly are plenty of 
examples of investors who have achieved tremendous success in these asset 
classes. Rather, the evidence indicates that whereas the best funds have gener-
ated fantastic returns for their clients, the entire industry as a whole has not 
performed much better than the public stock market. Pension plans, college 
endowments, and high net worth individuals who can obtain access to the 
best funds may find continued success in this asset class. For those of us who 
lack such access, however, the returns on the whole do not seem to be any 
better than stock investments.
Real Estate
Of the alternative assets discussed in this chapter, real estate is undoubtedly 
the easiest to explain and understand because we see it every day. Investible 
real estate, at least from the perspective of institutional investors, generally 
includes commercial office buildings, industrial factories and warehouses, “mul-
tifamily” apartment buildings, student housing, assisted-living facilities, retail 
locations (like malls), and self-storage warehouses. Although raw land can 
occasionally find its way into a real estate fund, individual residential proper-
ties (houses) generally do not.
As a result, an investment into a real estate fund in your portfolio likely will 
have very little overlap with the real estate you already own, such as your pri-
mary residence or a vacation property. While both of these residential prop-
erties would fall under the broader definition of “real estate,” their growth 
in value and any potential income you may generate from them is driven 
by somewhat different economic factors than the types of commercial real 
estate just outlined.
The types of real estate in which pension plans invest can be further  
broken down into three categories based on expected return and risk: core, 
value-added, and opportunistic.
1.	 Core real estate investments are fully leased, steady-as-
she-goes properties that are managed for cash flow and 
minimal capital gains.
2.	 Value-added real estate includes properties that are 
underleased, require some moderate decorative work, 
or need a change in the marketing or management plan 
to get back on track.

Invest Like an Institution
145
3.	 Opportunistic real estate contains raw land under devel-
opment, existing properties in need of a major remodel, 
or properties that will be demolished and rebuilt.
Moving across the spectrum from core to value-added to opportunistic, 
the potential for returns increases with the opportunities that the property  
presents—but so does the risk. As a result, pension plans tend to view each 
of these types of real estate as having a very different rationale for inclusion 
in the asset allocation. In fact, they often will treat each of these categories as 
its own distinct asset class, identifying a fraction of total assets that should be 
invested in each of the three types of real estate, just as they would assign a 
target allocation of, say, 35% of total assets to stocks or bonds.
From an asset allocation perspective, core and lower-risk, value-added proper-
ties are typically viewed as replacements for some fixed income investments 
and can often generate higher yields than fixed income with moderately more 
risk. Although these types of properties experience some mild ups and downs 
as the business cycle runs its course, office buildings, retail space, and the like 
tend to have fairly steady returns over time because the property manager’s 
main job is to keep tenants happy, keep the building full of tenants, and pass on 
the rental income to the investors.
Higher-risk, value-added investments and all opportunistic investments, on the 
other hand, are more like equity investments, especially private equity. Some 
investments will succeed fantastically well, and some will fail. On average, the 
ongoing need for the creation of more real estate over time to match the 
growing economy and population should be a driver of returns. However, 
any given property could be mismanaged, overleveraged, or poorly developed. 
Condominium development in the mid-2000s in South Florida and Las Vegas 
are two great examples of opportunistic investments that yielded tremendous 
returns for several years before facing a significant and extended downturn 
when demand for such properties diminished.
To gain exposure to all three types of real estate investments, public pension 
plans and other institutional investors typically will invest in both limited part-
nership real estate funds, which pose all the same limitations for individual 
investors that private equity limited partnerships do, and real estate invest-
ment trust (REIT) stocks. REITs are publicly traded companies that invest 
solely in real estate properties, typically through the use of a buy-and-hold 
strategy. Because they are publicly traded, a wide variety of individual REIT 
stocks, REIT index ETFs, and REIT mutual funds, both indexed and actively 
managed, are available to individual investors. Many companies that are not 

Chapter 8 | Alternative Asset Classes
146
legally defined as REITs2 yet still have significant real estate industry exposure, 
like property developers, hotel managers, and construction companies, are 
also available for investment. As a result, although individual investors may 
not be able to invest in some manager’s latest limited partnership that is only 
open to a handful of special clients, they can certainly gain exposure to the 
industry as a whole and benefit from the asset allocation benefits of invest-
ment in an asset class that is driven by different macroeconomic factors than 
regular stocks and bonds.
Because REITs are publicly traded securities and are subject to many of the 
short-term whims of the stock market, the returns of any given REIT fund 
will be more volatile than those of privately held real estate investments. 
Therefore, it is appropriate to compare their performance relative to the 
underlying properties over a very long-term horizon to smooth out short-
term market fluctuations.
In Figure 8-5, I have compared the returns of the Wilshire Real Estate Securities 
Index to the NCREIF National Property Index (which tracks the value of the 
underlying properties contained in all the real estate benchmarks) and the 
NCREIF ODCE Index (which tracks the aggregate returns of more than a 
dozen of the largest real estate investment partnerships). Given that REIT 
stocks are valued every second by the stock market while the underlying 
properties in real estate indices or funds are appraised about once a year, the 
two NCREIF indices look much “smoother” than the REIT index in Figure 8-5. 
However, over the time horizon of a long-term investor, they all demonstrate 
the same general trends, ebbing and flowing in value with the overall economy 
and real estate market. This leads me to conclude that an individual investor 
who is not part of a multibillion limited partnership real estate fund can actu-
ally gain exposure that is relatively similar to that of the private real estate 
market over long periods of time using REITs.
2To become a REIT, there are some legal tests that a company must pass, including distributing 
90% or more of its income in the form of dividends. Some real estate companies may not 
pass this rule and therefore will not technically be considered REITs. However, most real 
estate mutual funds will invest in anything that is "close enough," including companies 
in the real estate industry that may not legally be considered REITs but are real estate 
businesses in every other sense.

147
Why Invest in REITs?
At the present time, many asset managers, economists, bankers, and invest-
ment consulting firms expect stocks to return between 7% and 9% and bonds 
to return around 3% to 4% on average over the next several years. As a 
result, a 70% stocks, 30% bonds portfolio should therefore earn in the range 
of around 6% per year. Meanwhile, the consensus view is that core real estate 
funds and REITs should return 5% to 6% in the same market environment. 
This means that if you were to change your asset allocation from 70% stocks, 
30% bonds to 65% stocks, 25% bonds, and 10% REITs, your expected return 
would still be around 6%—but you would now be diversifying your risk across 
three asset classes instead of two.
In Chapter 2, I introduced three hypothetical investors who committed to 
three different asset allocations over time. In Table 8-1, I take a look again 
at the returns that Bob, one of the investors from that section, would have 
earned under his prior plan (80% US stocks, 20% bonds) versus what he 
would have earned with a more diversified portfolio (75% US stocks, 15% 
bonds, 10% REITs).

Table  8-1 shows that Bob’s portfolio would have experienced worse per-
formance with REITs than without them in 2007 and 2008, given that these 
were down years for real estate. However, every other year that saw a total 
return of less than 7% would have experienced improved results with REITs 
in the portfolio, not to mention a moderately better total return over the 
entire period. As such, Table  8-1 is a clear demonstration of the value of 
diversification.

Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have gotten a tremendous amount of press in the past decade 
but remain one of most poorly defined categories of investments. Just as 
“modes of transportation” is a very broad term that can include both a 
Boeing 747 and a kid’s tricycle, so too can hedge funds include funds that 
invest in stocks, bonds, emerging markets, and currencies. In addition, hedge 
fund portfolio managers can use any number of tools that are simply not 
available to the regular mutual fund manager.

Invest Like an Institution
149
Because hedge funds invest in assets that are available to other types of invest-
ment vehicles (mainly stocks and bonds), by most definitions and industry 
consensus, they are not considered to be a unique asset class. However, in my 
opinion, given that hedge fund managers can invest in ways that are not avail-
able to other investment managers, they should be given separate and distinct 
consideration from other asset classes in an asset allocation plan. Furthermore, 
the returns from hedge funds can be sufficiently different from the stocks and 
bonds in which they invest that they warrant a separate discussion and alloca-
tion within the asset allocation process, even if they are investing in underlying 
assets that you might already hold through more conventional portfolios.
Before diving into the merits of hedge fund investing, there are five terms that 
are important to understanding how hedge fund managers invest differently 
than other asset classes: shorting, leverage, multi-asset classes, strategy consis-
tency, and portfolio concentrations.
Shorting
The most basic difference between hedge funds and mutual funds is the ability 
of hedge fund managers to “short” securities. To short a security, the hedge 
fund manager will borrow the security from the portfolio of an index fund or 
some other large investor via an investment bank, paying a specified rate of 
interest for the loan. The hedge fund manager will then sell the security on 
the market, hoping that the price will fall over time and he or she can buy it 
back at a cheaper price to replace the borrowed shares while earning a capi-
tal gain. If the price rises, the hedge fund will suffer a loss when it buys back 
the shares it borrowed and sold at that higher price, but will make money if 
the stock falls before it buys it back and returns it to the party from which 
it was borrowed. A “short” can either be a position expressing a view that a 
single company is overpriced and will fall in value, or it can be done as part of 
a paired trade, a strategy I will discuss following in the section that details the 
main types of hedge funds.
Leverage
If you give a mutual fund $1,000, the portfolio manager will buy $1,000 worth 
of stocks, maybe minus some small amount of cash the manager holds on 
hand. If you give a hedge fund $1,000, the fund could set up positions worth 
$2,000, $3,000, or even more. These positions could be highly directional, 
meaning that you are 200% or 300% exposed to the equity market. On the 
other hand, they could be offset, with 100% bought long and 100% sold short 
market exposure, resulting in no directional bias and returns based solely on 
the manager’s skill in picking securities to buy and sell.

Chapter 8 | Alternative Asset Classes
150
Multi-Asset Class
When you invest in a stock mutual fund, the manager mostly buys stocks. 
When you invest in a bond mutual fund, the manager mostly buys bonds. In a 
hedge fund, some managers might have positions in stocks, bonds, currencies, 
and commodities, short and long, all at the same time.
Strategy Consistency
Although most hedge fund managers adhere to a stated investment philoso-
phy, many managers are opportunistic and change direction and strategies as 
events warrant. Whereas this can be positive for your portfolio because the 
manager can respond to market events, it can also be negative because you 
never have a perfectly clear idea of exactly what some managers are doing, 
resulting in unwanted biases and risks at your total portfolio level.
Portfolio Concentration
Whereas a public stock manager might hold 75 to 200 positions and a bond 
manager might hold hundreds or even thousands of securities at once, some 
hedge funds might have only a few high-conviction positions at any given time. 
Because hedge fund managers are generally compensated predominantly for 
portfolio performance, instead of in accordance with an annual percentage of 
an asset’s base fee, they are generally not afraid to take on disproportionate 
levels of risk when they feel it is appropriate to do so.
Hedge funds can use the five tools outlined previously (and others) to take 
many forms; a few of the most common types of hedge funds are listed follow-
ing. This list is not intended to be exhaustive, as there are at least 14 distinct 
types of hedge funds, and more are being created all the time. Rather, the fol-
lowing is an indicative list of the types of strategies in which you might invest 
if you choose to add hedge funds to your portfolio.
Macroeconomic
For many people, investors like George Soros, who strides the world for 
opportunities and once forced the Bank of England to devalue the British 
Pound, are the first thing that come to mind when they think of hedge funds. 
Although the hedge fund world has moved away from a reliance on macro-
economic funds over the last 20 years toward more stock- and bond-focused 
strategies, the quintessential hedge fund strategy is still to invest anywhere and 
in any asset, using leverage and large positions to move markets and generate  
a profit.

Long/Short
Let’s say that a manager has no interest in positioning a portfolio for a rising 
or falling stock market over the next year but has a strong conviction that GM 
will experience better returns than Ford. In this case, the hedge fund will buy 
100 shares of GM and sell short 100 shares of Ford. If the market goes up 20% 
over the next year, both stocks will likely have returns in that same ballpark, 
generating no market return for the manager. However, if GM goes up 22% in 
that bull market and Ford only rises 18%, the manager will make roughly a 4% 
profit on the difference between the two stocks’ prices completely indepen-
dent of the movement of the overall stock market. A portfolio of long and 
short positions across a variety of industries or countries, therefore, gener-
ates returns based on the manager’s skill at picking companies to buy and sell 
while remaining agnostic on the market as a whole.
Merger Arbitrage
Let’s say that Company A announces that it is acquiring Company B for $50 
a share, which was trading for $40 a share at the time of the announcement. 
Between the time that the merger is announced and the time that the trans-
action is concluded, shareowners of both companies will need to approve the 
transaction, government regulators will weigh in regarding whether the com-
bined company violates antitrust laws, and other suitors could offer higher 
bids for the company that is being acquired. As a result, the stock of Company 
B may only trade at $45 or $47 a share until all these concerns are resolved, 
despite the offer price of $50 a share, because investors are not convinced 
that this transaction will actually be finalized. A merger arbitrage manager 
will weigh the pros and cons of the merger and assess the likelihood that the 
merger will be concluded. Then, if that assessment is positive, the manager 
will take a position that allows them to earn that remaining $3 or $5 premium 
below the transaction price if the merger succeeds. On the other hand, if they 
think the merger is doomed to fail, they will take a position that will profit 
from the corresponding movement in stock prices after the merger is called 
off—when the prices of the buying company and target company return to 
their preannouncement levels.
Index Arbitrage/Statistical Arbitrage
This type of fund exists in many varieties, but the commonality among all of 
them is that they take advantage of small and temporary mispricings in the 
market. One example would be a stock that trades in New York and Paris.  
At any given instant, the share price in New York and Paris, after accounting 
for currency, could be different by a very small amount. If a manager could 

Chapter 8 | Alternative Asset Classes
152
buy the stock in one location, sell it in the other, and buy or sell Euros for US 
Dollars as needed, they could lock in a small profit. Maybe the trade generated 
a fraction of a penny a share, but it only took milliseconds to execute with very 
little risk. If the manager could do that 1,000 times a day across a wide variety 
of securities and markets, the results could add up to a significant return.
Convertible Arbitrage
Convertible bonds are fixed income securities that can be exchanged for 
shares of stock in the underlying company at certain prices under certain 
conditions. A hedge fund might buy or sell the stocks or bonds of these com-
panies to take advantage of the mathematics behind the price relationship 
between these two connected securities.
Fixed Income
If AAA-rated corporate bonds rarely default but are priced to yield 0.75% 
more than similar maturity treasury bonds, why not buy the corporate bonds 
and sell short the treasuries to lock in that 0.75% return, less any cost of 
financing? Although a net return of 0.25% or 0.50% may not sound like much,  
if you can leverage that up high enough, it starts to generate a significant return. 
Long Term Capital Management, prior to its collapse in 1998, was leveraging 
this trade hundreds of times and generating fantastic results for its clients 
right up to the point that it collapsed.
Capital Structure Arbitrage
Many companies that issue debt do it in a variety of tiers. Some bonds may 
have a higher or lower preference in the event of bankruptcy or a higher or 
lower priority for interest payments. As a result, these bonds, although they 
are issued by the same company, will trade at different yields to reflect their 
relative likelihood of being impacted by a default. A hedge fund can invest in 
one tier and short another, capitalizing on the spread between them if the man-
ager believes that the default premium for the lower-rated tier is overpriced.
Short-Biased Equities
Some people are just pessimists. Short-biased managers are the muckrakers 
of the hedge fund world, trying to uncover every bit of sordid news about a 
company, its management, and the skeletons in its closet that they can find. 
Then, when they discover a company that they think is doomed for a comeup-
pance, they take a short position and spread the word, telling the press, online 
message boards, their peers, regulators, and anyone else they can think of.

If the truth comes out and is as bad as they hoped, the price of the company’s 
stock will fall dramatically, delivering great returns for those who were short 
that stock.
Generally Anything Else that Doesn’t Want to Be 
Constrained and Can Charge a High Fee
Yes, this is a catch-all category and includes leveraged emerging markets man-
agers, opportunistic investors, and quasi-private equity investors that will buy 
private investments in public companies. In some cases, it can even include 
hedge funds that buy a large stake in a company, pressure management to 
make some change in strategy, personnel, capital structure, etc., and then hope 
to profit from the improvement in the share price. If someone can think up a 
new strategy, charge a big fee for it, and find investors who are willing to invest 
in it, it is probably a hedge fund.
As you can see, there are a wide variety of hedge funds that share few com-
monalities—except maybe consistently higher fees, leverage, and risk concen-
tration than those normally found in more traditional investments, like single 
asset class mutual funds. Hedge funds, as this list makes clear, really can encom-
pass any manager who doesn’t invest in just plain old stocks and bonds.
Do Hedge Funds Generate Returns That Are 
­Commensurate with Their Fees and Risk?
For years, hedge funds have promised to the pension fund and endowment 
community that they will generate “stock-like returns with bond-like risk.”  
I heard those words in sales pitches and presentations to my clients by man-
agers more times than I care to count. Hedge funds have promised for years 
to be an “all-weather” strategy to the pension fund and endowment com-
munity, claiming to be agnostic to the direction of the markets and capable 
of generating returns in all environments. In reality, though, the truth was not 
quite so rosy. In 2008, when stocks fell 40% or more, measures of the broad 
hedge fund universe were down about 20%—which was better than the mar-
ket as a whole but terrible for an investment that promised returns without 
directional market exposure. Although the value of the average hedge fund 
has since recovered, the damage done to the industry in the eye of many of 
my clients is immeasurable. Many of them are asking the same question that 
you should as you consider including them in your portfolio: Are they simply 
a high-fee way of getting limited market exposure, or do they really offer a 
unique source of returns, investment manager skill, and value?

In Figure 8-6, the solid line represents the rolling one-year return for the 
Credit Suisse Dow Jones Hedge Fund Index. The dashed line is a 50/50 blend 
of the MSCI World (stock) Index and the Barclays Aggregate (bond) Index. 
Although the two lines were fairly divergent prior to about 2000, they have 
basically experienced the same results ever since. What this means is that 
over the last 10 years, hedge funds on the whole have devolved from an asset 
class with a unique and diversifying return and risk stream into simply a high-
cost way of constructing a 50/50 stock and bond portfolio, where everyone 
with a Bloomberg terminal can call themselves a hedge fund and make a for-
tune. For the math wizards reading this book, the correlation between these 
two series has averaged 0.793 since mid-2003, which is an indication that there 
is far less diversification between hedge funds in general and simple stock and 
bond exposure than the industry would lead you to believe.

As was the case with private equity earlier in this chapter, I firmly believe that 
some hedge funds are capable of generating unique sources of return through 
unique investment strategies and tools as well as through the expertise of the 
large number of great investors who have left institutional asset managers or 
investment banks over the years to start their own companies. The analysis 
previously, therefore, does not discount the case for all hedge funds from 
investment. As was the case with private equity and real estate, it is entirely 
possible that large institutional investors may be able to find a few hedge 
funds that will have superior returns relative to the population as a whole and 
invest in them, generating returns far better than the chart preceding shows.

For an individual investor, though, broad exposure to the entire industry of 
hedge funds through some of the nascent hedge fund mutual fund and ETF 
structures may not add much real value to your portfolio, especially when the 
extremely high fees of hedge funds are considered.
Commodities
It can be difficult to watch 30 minutes of cable news without seeing at least 
a few advertisements for investments in gold. Although gold, and many other 
commodities, is often discussed as a store of value in times of crisis or a pro-
tection against inflation, investors need to carefully consider the nature of, 
and problems with, commodities investments before investing their money 
in them. Some pension plans invest in commodities to hedge against inflation, 
although a clear link between commodities prices and inflation is dubious, 
as shown in the chart following. Others will include commodities trading 
strategies within hedge fund portfolios because there can be gains to be 
made by skilled investors trading in commodities, just as there was in stocks  
and bonds.
Figure 8-7 compares the rolling three-year returns of the GSCI Commodities 
Index against the US Consumer Price Index (CPI). If you can see a clear pat-
tern, please let me know. The commodities index has been far more volatile 
than CPI and does not appear to track it in the slightest.

In the pension industry, the common view is that commodities generally are 
not an appropriate asset for long-term investors to buy and hold like one 
would with an index fund of stocks or bonds. A government bond pays inter-
est over the time that you hold it. A share of stock may fluctuate in price as 
much as commodities, but over time the company may pay cash dividends and 
grow in total value due to operating success. A bar of gold, a barge full of cop-
per, or a barrel of oil, meanwhile, pays no interest or dividends and generates 
no economic activity on its own. The value of that investment from one day to 
the next fluctuates not as a result of the cash yield or reward to the investor 
but rather as a sole result of what someone else is willing to pay for it. Some 
commodities, like wheat, cocoa, soybeans, pork bellies, and even oil, can actu-
ally decline in value over time due to the fact that food products rot and oil 
can turn into tar, supporting the case that a buy-and-hold strategy may not be 
appropriate over the long term.
There is a stronger argument in favor of investing in commodities as part of a 
hedge fund portfolio, though. As you can see in Figure 8-7, the prices of com-
modities have been volatile over time, and there is nothing that traders like 
more than volatility because it presents opportunities for profits. Whether 
a hedge fund is trading short-term stock movements, currency fluctuations, 
bond yields, or commodities prices really doesn’t matter to the hedge fund. 
Trading is trading, and short-term profits are all good. After all, the more 
volatile the price of an asset is, the more opportunity there could be to find 
a profit in trading it.
In my opinion, individual investors are best served by staying away from com-
modities as long-term investments. If you are really concerned about infla-
tion, there are investments like Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), 
which are Treasury bonds whose principal and coupons are linked directly to 
inflation and therefore make a much better inflation hedge. Trading in com-
modities should be reserved for individuals or funds that wish to speculate 
solely on short-term movements.
Fees
Although alternative investments are very different from one another in prac-
tice and in results, they do have one thing in common that investors should 
be aware of: fees.
I will go into great detail on fees in Chapter 9, but here is a quick summary. 
Hedge funds, private equity funds, and private real estate funds all charge fees 
that are far higher than other types of investments. (Commodities invest-
ments can be made through high-cost hedge funds or through moderate-
cost index funds.) All of these active managers typically charge a base fee of 
1% to 3% plus a share, typically 10% to 30%, of the profits. For a hedge fund,  
for example, that charges the industry standard 2% base fee and 20% 

Invest Like an Institution
157
­performance fee, a 7% pre-fee return on the portfolio yields clients a net 
return after fees of 3.6%.4 In contrast, a 7% pre-fee return on a stock port-
folio will generate net returns of 6% to 6.5% for actively managed portfolios 
and about 6.95% for index funds. If you invest with a “fund of hedge funds,” an 
investment manager that finds hedge funds for you and builds you a portfolio 
of hedge fund investments, bears all the cost of managing the portfolio, and 
conducts all due diligence on the underlying hedge funds in which your money 
is invested, you will often be charged 0.5% to 2.5% more in fees, plus another 
10% of the performance. That 3.6% net return on just the hedge fund invest-
ments could be very close to zero for you when all the fees from the fund of 
funds are taken into account.
I periodically meet with hedge funds in places as diverse as Switzerland, the 
United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and the results of these econom-
ics are obvious. While pension plans struggle to improve their returns and 
decrease the burden they impose on the taxpayers, it is difficult in hedge fund 
meccas like Geneva, Switzerland and Greenwich, Connecticut to walk 25 feet 
without tripping over a Ferrari or passing a store selling $20,000 watches. The 
amount of wealth that is created by using money from others to generate 7% 
returns and then pocketing the vast majority of it as fees is overwhelming. 
It also illustrates quite clearly why there is so little profit left for clients that 
their net returns basically track the public markets, as shown in Figure 8-6. 
The 100-foot yachts parked in the harbors of Stamford, Connecticut, are no 
different and are often purchased with wealth generated by incredible fees on 
private equity funds, which return on average to investors the same amount 
that the stock market does, as shown in Figure 8-2 and Figure 8-3, or worse.
Again, although there are a handful of excellent managers who can generate 
superior returns for clients, my experience with the vast majority of these 
types of funds is that the fees charged are not proportionate to the real value 
created for clients. Over the last few years, even as returns have gotten worse, 
fees in alternative investments have remained constant or have even gone up, 
especially among hedge fund managers. Clients have seen their disappointing 
results and tried to move into funds that they think will do better than their 
current portfolio is doing, putting tremendous upward pressure on the top 
funds. This, in turn, tends to shift the pricing of the entire industry upward, 
despite the dubious evidence that the hedge fund industry in total adds any 
net value in the first place. Some efforts have been made to shift the balance 
between base fees and performance fees more toward performance fees to 
reward only superior performance. However, in an industry where demand 
far outstrips supply, the ability of discerning investors to change the pricing 
marketplace is scarce.
47% – 2% – (20% x 7%) = 3.6%

Summary
Does the average investor need any of these?
The inclusion of alternative investments tends to be the single biggest dif-
ferentiator between the total portfolios of large pension plans and endow-
ments and those of individual investors. In the right markets, they have added 
tremendous value, but in the wrong markets they have magnified pension 
plan losses. Does the individual really need exposure to these asset classes 
to compete, or is he or she better off replicating what can be replicated and 
ignoring the rest?
The evidence in this chapter seems to illustrate very clearly to me that the 
excess returns generated by some alternative investments might be a thing 
of the past. Although there are still some fantastic private equity funds and 
hedge funds out there, the average fund is no longer as enticing as it once was. 
In both industries, fund sizes have grown and grown to the point where the 
portfolio managers are often working more to protect their base manage-
ment fees than to maximize their incentive (performance) fees. In this new 
reality, 2% of a few billion dollars produces a lot more income for the portfo-
lio manager than 2% of the far smaller fund sizes from a decade ago.
The continuous flow of new talent into the hedge fund industry from pro-
prietary trading desks at investment banks or concentrated investment man-
agers complicates this issue because many investors are willing to pay the 
newest hedge fund managers any price to join the industry. Quite often, how-
ever, the driver of the returns these traders generated when they were at an 
investment bank was not their own brilliance. Rather, it was their ability to 
access information flows and resources that the bank provided to them as 
employees—advantages that they are no longer privy to now that they are 
on their own.
Real estate, despite the debacle of the 2008–2011 period, seems to be the 
only place where individual investors can still improve their overall outcomes 
through the diversification that another asset class can add to their portfolios. 
Whereas large pension plans often generate their exposure to this asset class 
through investments in limited partnerships that are unavailable to the aver-
age person, the preceding evidence shows that publicly available REIT securi-
ties are a reasonable proxy for the private real estate investment industry 
over very long periods of time. Given that REITs (and the broader real estate-
related companies sector) are available in ETFs, index funds, and actively man-
aged mutual funds, there are plenty of ways in which the individual investor 
can add exposure to real estate in both a higher- and lower-risk manner.

Invest Like an Institution
159
No matter which course you choose, to invest in alternatives or to remain 
focused just on plain vanilla public securities, bear in mind that although alter-
natives have helped to improve the returns of large investors like endowments 
and public pension plans for years, the vast majority of the returns that large 
pensions have generated have come from stocks and bonds. Private equities, 
real estate, commodities, and hedge funds usually constitute less than 25% of 
all of an institutional fund’s assets. In many cases, pension plans have used logic 
similar to what I have outlined in this chapter to decide against investing in 
most or all of the alternative investments, yet their results have not suffered 
irreparable harm. Given the lack of access to these types of investments by 
individual investors, their high fees, their lack of liquidity and transparency, and 
their sheer complexity, you may be very well served by simply devoting your 
energy to increasing your savings rate, reviewing your asset allocation more 
frequently, or increasing the amount of time you devote to researching public 
securities funds.

Fees and  
Expenses
Reducing the Inevitable Drain on Assets
Now that your asset allocation and investment structures have been set up to 
generate the best return/risk trade-off, and you have selected a lineup of 
investment managers and funds to help you generate the best outperfor-
mance possible, now it is time, as the Road Map to Financial Success graphic 
implies, to make sure that you are getting what you pay for. Fees and expenses 
are the only certainty in your investment portfolio—they will drive your 
returns and assets down. Although there are some expenses that are worth 
paying, especially if they can generate a higher rate of return, it is important 
that investors understand just how impactful even small differences in fees can 
be over the time span of a career and retirement.

Chapter 9 | Fees and Expenses

Seeking to minimize these costs wherever possible is the most surefire way 
to send positive results right to your bottom line. Ben Franklin’s famous saying 
“a penny saved is a penny earned” was never more true than when it comes 
to the costs of managing your retirement portfolio. Every penny you do not 
pay out to a broker, bank, or mutual fund is one more penny, plus interest, 
you will be able to call on some day. I have often been told that the great-
est benefit that my profession (investment consulting) brings to large pen-
sion systems, endowments, and foundations is our hardnosed attitude toward 
fees and unnecessary risks, some of which were covered in my discussion of 
investment structures and alternative investments. In this chapter, my focus 
will be on the potential cost-related risks and alarm bells that you will want 
to look out for to make sure the majority of your investment dollars are used 
to make you, and not your financial planner, richer.
I’ll start with a personal example to show how intelligent people can make 
unknowing mistakes when it comes to fees and expenses.
When I was growing up, my parents invested $10,000 in a college savings 
account for my younger brother and me. At the time, brokerage commis-
sions were generally fixed and were very expensive in comparison to the 
low-fee and no-fee brokers that pervade the market today. There was no 
CNN, CNBC, or Fox Business yet; Michael Bloomberg was still an employee 
at Salomon Brothers; and the Wall Street Journal was predominantly read by 
people who rode subways to work in lower Manhattan. In short, the amount 
of information readily available to the average investor was very limited.
My parents checked around with some friends, and the name of a financial 
planner was suggested. After a meeting or two with him, the planner sug-
gested that they invest all of the money in our college savings account in one 
single large cap growth fund. It was a relatively new fund, but it came from a 
well-known mutual fund company and had lots of “potential” in the financial 
planner’s eyes. It sounded like a reasonable suggestion from an expert, and 
so my parents opened accounts for my brother and me and made the initial 
investment. Thereafter, when my brother or I made some extra money over 
the summer or at after-school jobs, we would diligently send checks over to 
the financial planner to add to the account.
In the end, the fund did rather well by the time we both graduated from high 
school, although the never-ending bull market probably had more to do with 
the success of the fund than the manager’s particular skill. Given that I was 
closer to the beginning of my freshman year in the late 1980s than my brother 
was, the Black Monday crash of 1987 cost me a bit more of my balance than it 
did him, but that wasn’t really the fault of the financial planner. Everyone lost 
money in that decline.

Invest Like an Institution
163
All in all, the fund did relatively well and it seemed like the financial planner did 
a reasonable job for us; and I can’t recall any complaints we had at the time.  
In fact, I’m sure we passed his name to others who needed someone to advise 
them. It wasn’t until years later, once I had several years of experience in the 
financial services industry under my belt, that I thought back to this invest-
ment and realized just how many mistakes were made.
As you could probably guess from discussions in previous chapters, I am of the 
opinion that the financial planner’s decision to put 100% of my family’s money 
into an aggressive, large cap, US growth stock fund was NOT a smart idea—
especially because my brother and I had less than 10 years to go before we 
needed to access the funds in the account to pay for college. First, given the 
relatively short time frame until the money would be needed for college, the 
asset allocation should have had some balance between risky and less-risky 
investments, or additional contributions should have flowed into a lower-risk 
investment to dilute the weight to that single fund. Second, the sole selection 
of a large cap growth fund imposed two unwanted style biases (large capital-
ization stocks and growth stocks) on this portfolio.1 Third, choosing a single 
manager for the entire investment amount left us open to a large amount 
of idiosyncratic risk, or risk from just one investment manager’s decisions. 
Investing smaller amounts in each of a few funds would have reduced the 
potential impact of poor performance from any of them.
Now, I know what you’re thinking. As the title implies, this chapter is supposed 
to be about fees and expenses, not about all the mistakes my family’s financial 
planner made when he gave us advice regarding asset allocation, investment 
structure, and manager selection. Well, up to this point, I have left the details 
about what the planner’s advice cost out of the story; and, frankly, setting all 
the poor advice just mentioned aside, this is the part that has really bugged 
me over the years.
First, the management fee for the mutual fund was more than 1.5%. I’m sure 
the planner showed my parents data that said that this fee was better than 
those they would have to pay for the average fund at the time, but 1.5% 
was still ridiculously high. Saying this fee is below average is like saying that I 
can run faster than half the world population, as long as you include babies 
and the elderly in that other half. Not exactly a strong statement regarding  
1A combination of growth and value funds would have been much better and more risk 
controlled. Imagine if this story had taken place in the late 1990s instead of the late 
1980s, and my college savings suffered through the extended collapse in technology stocks 
instead of the relatively short 1987 crash. As bad as the overall market losses were during 
the dot-com collapse, growth stocks dramatically underperformed the broader market. 
With only a few years to go until college, there simply would not have been time to repair 
that damage and regrow my assets.

Chapter 9 | Fees and Expenses 
164
the planner’s supposedly superior fee structure. Second, the fund paid the 
­planner an annual “12B-1” fee of 0.25% to help pay for marketing and distribu-
tion. Part of that 0.25% probably flowed back to the planner every year we 
remained invested. Third, and this is the worst part of all, the fund charged a 
“front-load” fee of 5.25% for every contribution my family made to the fund. 
This fee went directly to the financial planner as compensation for recom-
mending the fund to us. For that initial $10,000, he earned an immediate 
$525. Each time my brother or I saved up $500 from summer jobs and sent it 
to him, he made another $26.25 for doing nothing subsequent to that initial 
recommendation.
So what is the end of the story? The $10,000 invested on Day 1 was only 
worth an initial $9,300.2 Every year, an additional 1.75% was subtracted 
from the value of that portfolio as a management and sales fee, regardless of  
performance, plus 5.25% from any new contribution.
I don’t disagree that the broker was owed something for that initial meet-
ing and recommendation. However, an additional 5.25% every time we made 
another investment over the life of the fund simply doesn’t sit well with me 
today, now that I have the benefit of hindsight. In addition, whereas one could 
argue that maybe that first $525 was an appropriate amount of compensation 
for the time and effort he spent determining the right investment strategy 
and recommendation for us (although I would guess that the vast major-
ity of his clients received similar recommendations to invest in that same 
fund that took little incremental work), imagine if we had invested $50,000 
instead of $10,000 and he had made the same recommendation to put 100% 
of our money into that mutual fund. Would $2,600 have been a fair amount 
of compensation for the exact same amount of effort? Now we are starting 
to talk about really meaningful amounts of money coming out of your pocket. 
If he has two new clients who are both rolling over 401(k) accounts into 
IRAs, and he gives similar advice to each client, should the person who saved 
$500,000 over a lifetime pay him five times as much as the person who saved 
$100,000—for precisely the same advice?
Put even more simply, was it appropriate that he recommended to us a fund 
that paid him 5.25% up front plus 0.25% every year on top of more fees from 
future contributions? Was that really the single best option he could have 
found, or was it the single best option for his personal income statement?  
This, in a nutshell, is a real-world example of everything that can go wrong 
with an advisor, and everything that you need to avoid.

Planners vs. Brokers
Although it may seem like a broad generality, in my experience the global financial 
services industry breaks down into one of four models. In the next few pages I 
will explain these models and what to ask and watch for when choosing money 
managers and expert advice. Although there are certainly well-intentioned 
people in the financial services industry who have their clients’ interests first in 
their hearts, investors and customers need to be aware of these industry models 
when searching for truly trusted advisors and partners.
Per-Transaction Model
The first and most common business model in the financial services industry 
includes those professionals who work on a per-transaction basis. This is the 
model that your typical stockbroker falls into. If he convinces you to buy 1,000 
shares of XYZ, he makes a commission. If he isn’t sufficiently persuasive or 
fails to call his entire client list on a regular basis, he simply doesn’t get paid 
as much. Under this model, salesmanship equals profits. Most of Wall Street 
works this way, with investment banks earning fees only when they can con-
vince companies to merge or divest; a start-up to issue an initial public offer-
ing (IPO); or a money manager or private client (you) to buy or sell a stock 
about which they have a strong opinion (or in which they have a large in-house 
position that they need to reduce by selling it to their clients). At the end of 
the day, the more that professionals working on a per-transaction basis can get 
their clients to churn their accounts or engage in transactions, which may or 
may not be beneficial in the long run, the more they get paid.
Whereas this business model might help Wall Street firms improve their  
bottom lines and decide who are their best performers and deserve to be the 
most richly rewarded, this is the single worst model for you as a client. If a 
broker is able to convince you to trade 10 times as often as you need to, with 
dubious benefits to you as a client, that broker is paid 10 times as much as he 
would be if he simply gave you longer-term, buy-and-hold advice. In my per-
sonal example previously, the financial planner clearly had a strong incentive 
to sell us the highest fee and highest load fund he thought we would agree to 
buy because that would generate the most income for him through that initial 
transaction fee (the 5.25% front load).
Retainer-Based Model
An alternative to the per-transaction model is the retainer-based model, 
where the financial advisor or investment consultant simply provides advice 
for a fair fee that is based on the time she or he spends with you. Regardless 
of whether you have $100,000 or $1,000,000 to invest, the fee is generally 

Chapter 9 | Fees and Expenses 
166
the same because the amount of work is virtually the same. Your accountant 
or lawyer doesn’t charge ten times as much for the same project for a very 
rich client as he does for a middle-class client, unless the complexity and time 
commitment requires it. Why should your financial advisor? If the goal is to 
find an appropriate asset allocation and manager lineup, it really doesn’t mat-
ter if you have $10,000 or $10,000,000 to invest. All you are doing is adding a 
couple of zeros after some of the line items.
Most of the consultants who advise public pension plans work based on this 
model. When you are talking about tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, 
a per-transaction fee is simply impractical and does not encourage the con-
sultant to share in the long-term success of the fund. In addition, a prede-
termined annual fee helps to ensure that the consultant or advisor has the 
client’s best interests at heart because the consultant’s only goal is to keep 
the client happy, and he or she receives no compensation for any of the advice 
and recommendations provided. Like so much of the advice in this book, if this 
philosophy works for a huge pension plan, why shouldn’t it work for you?
In Chapter 2, I suggested that meeting with a representative from the IRA  
services area at your local bank or maybe a client service person at a store 
front for a discount brokerage firm might be a great way to get more informa-
tion about the asset allocation that is right for you. Assuming that this service 
is provided “free” to you as a client, you are dealing with a firm that employs a 
retainer-based business model because you are already paying for that advice 
somewhere in your account (like quarterly account fees or a lower interest 
rate on your cash balances than you might be able to get somewhere else). 
As this client service professional is not paid on a per-transaction basis but 
rather is paid a salary by the bank to keep you happy as a client of the firm, the 
advice is more likely to have your best interests in mind. On the other hand, 
if he starts telling you that all the bank’s in-house mutual funds are the best 
in their asset classes and are the only things you should ever consider buying, 
you should start questioning whether he really is getting a transaction-based 
fee after all through some kind of fee rebate or sales incentive.
Percentage of Assets Model
The third model I will detail is the model commonly employed by asset man-
agement organizations. Most money managers, ranging from mutual funds to 
private equity funds to hedge funds, are paid a fee equal to some percentage 
of assets per year. If assets grow passively due to market movement or actively 
due to superior performance or the addition of new client accounts, the firm 
earns more income because the assets under management have increased. 
Similarly, if markets decline or clients leave the firm, income and profits decline. 

Invest Like an Institution
167
From the client perspective, if your account grows in value, regardless of 
whether that growth is the result of a strong market return or actual manager 
investment skill, you pay more. If it declines, you pay less. Fundamentally, this 
seems more equitable than the transaction-based model because the manager 
is generally rewarded for successful outcomes for clients.
Another very fair aspect of this model is that the very large clients that I work 
with, and even some individual investors, tend to benefit from “breakpoints” in 
their fees. If the client gives a manager $10 million to manage in some strategy, 
their fee might be 0.30% per year. If they give them $50 million, the fee might 
fall to 0.25%. Although a larger amount of assets might eventually cause the 
manager to add additional trading or research staff, the incremental cost of 
servicing a $50 million account versus a $10 million account is practically zero, 
and the fees reflect those economies of scale.
Although an individual investor may not be able to negotiate their own fee 
schedule with an investment manager as a pension plan would, most mutual 
fund firms offer multiple share classes of the same funds, where larger port-
folio sizes will have lower fees. So, whereas you might not be able to pay the 
bottom dollar, low fees that large pension plans pay, some smart shopping or 
research might enable you to find the fund you want for less than you initially 
thought.
In fairness to the managers, there is one problem with this model: market 
movements can cause unwanted effects. Imagine a scenario like the 1990s, 
where stock prices rose more than 100% over a few years. A manager who 
underperforms the market but manages to not lose any clients will see their 
income double, despite demonstrating no skill in their client accounts and 
simply tracking (or even trailing) the market return. Similarly, in a bear market, 
a manager who protects significant amounts of value (i.e., loses less money 
than the market as a whole) and does a great job for their clients will see their 
income fall due to the lower asset base.
Payment for Results Model
The fourth model is based on payment for results and is most commonly 
levied as a performance-based fee, which is also known in some asset classes 
as carried interest. For a typical stock or bond portfolio, a pension plan that 
employs performance-based fees will pay a lower management fee than for a 
similar base-fee-only arrangement but then will pay an additional fee to the 
manager when returns exceed the market index or some other benchmark. In 
other words, a money manager could be paid, say, 0.50% a year by clients who 
prefer pure management fees, or, for those who want a performance-based 
fee, a 0.30% management fee plus 20% of the amount the portfolio exceeds 

Chapter 9 | Fees and Expenses 
168
the S&P 500 over a given time period.3 The benefits of this fee structure are 
obvious: when the money manager does poorly, the client pays a far lower 
fee than the normal base fee and does not reward the money manager for 
mediocrity. When times are good and the money manager outperforms the 
benchmark for that portfolio, the client theoretically should be sufficiently 
happy with the superior returns to cut a far larger check. In practice, though, 
if a number of performance-based fee managers outperform at the same time, 
a client might see their calculation of total fees paid jump significantly, some-
times drawing unwanted attention to that bottom-line number.
There are also fee structures that use a combination of the preceding. As I 
discussed briefly in Chapter 8, private equity, real estate, and hedge fund man-
agers, for example, tend to charge management fees of 1% to 3%, and even 
sometimes more, plus a performance-based fee of 20% to 30%, often above 
a benchmark of 0%. For a hedge fund that charges a 2% base fee and a 20% 
performance fee—which is the most commonly used fee structure for hedge 
funds (usually referred to as “2 and 20”)—a mediocre performance of 6% in 
a year can result in a fee of 3.2%!4 That’s right. The manager generates a 6% 
return in a year with your money and you only get a 2.8% return. No wonder 
there are so many private jets parked in Westchester, New York.
What Fee Structure Is Right for the Personal 
­Investor?
I know that was probably a lot more detail than you ever wanted or needed 
to know about fee structures, but it is extremely important to understand the 
motivations of your service providers in the financial services industry. When 
you make savings and investment decisions, a great deal of your future can be 
at stake, and there are some people in the financial services industry (as there 
are in many other industries) looking to take as much of your money as they 
can legally (and sometimes illegally) get away with. You need to thoroughly 
understand the motivations behind the advice and services that they provide 
to you and, where possible, negotiate terms that protect you against those 
that will try to use your assets to enrich themselves. At the end of the day,  
3In practice, these types of structures usually have stated maximum fees, which discourage 
excessive risk taking by the money manager, as well as some kind of long-term smoothing 
mechanism to ensure that years of bad performance are held against the money manager 
during periods of good performance to avoid overpaying for middling results in aggregate. 
I’m simplifying the concept here slightly to avoid making this example too complicated.
4A 2% base fee plus a performance fee of 20% equals 2% plus 1.2% (20% times 6%) for a 
grand total of 3.2% in fees. With a gross (before-fee) return of 6%, that leaves 2.8% for 
the client.

169
you and your service providers should have an alignment of interests: only 
when and if you do well are they rewarded or retained for their services.
Of the previously mentioned compensation models, the quickest one that 
you need to rule out involves any funds that charge front-load fees and the 
advisors that sell them. It is difficult for me to imagine a scenario in which the 
interests of an advisor who is paid on a per-transaction basis are truly aligned 
with those of his clients. In my preceding personal example, the advisor was 
paid a sales commission up front and had little ongoing reward for maintaining 
a successful relationship with my family beyond some fraction of that small 
marketing and distribution fee. For per-transaction fee providers, simply put, 
the incentive is to sell you as much product as they can and advise you to sell 
underperforming funds the instant they think the funds look weak to free up 
your money for more funds that pay them a front load. Each time the advi-
sor successfully advises you to follow his or her recommendations, you lose 
another 5.25% of your money. You also lose, as I did in my youth, each time 
you make a periodic contribution into your savings and buy more of that fund, 
paying another 5.25% for the advisor’s original advice.
In Table 9-1, I imagine three different arrangements with financial planners. 
In all examples, I start with $25,000 to invest and then add $2,000 to the 
investor’s savings at the end of each year. To keep things simple, I will assume 
that the investments earn 8% every year. The first column is an example of 
the investor who falls for all the tricks, including a front load of 5.25%, high 
management fees of 1.50%, and 12B-1 fees of 0.25% (which is the full slate of 
fees and expenses that hit my account years ago). The second column repre-
sents an investor who pays an advisor a hard dollar amount of $500 for advice 
every 5 years and then invests in a different share class of the same fund with 
a management fee of only 1.00%. The third column is for an investor who uses 
the free resources at her or his bank to develop the asset allocation plan and 
invests much of that portfolio in the lowest-cost index funds and ETFs, result-
ing in an average fee of 0.30%.

Chapter 9 | Fees and Expenses 
170
As you can see, even small differences in fees really start to add up. The low-
cost investor (3) has almost $13,000 more than the high-cost investor (1)  
after just 10 years, and more than $6,000 more than our reduced-cost  
investor (2). After 20 years of saving money (not shown in this table), the 
­difference between Investors 1 and 3 grows to more than $50,000. That’s 
$50,000 extra that Investor 1 put into the advisor’s pocket instead of his or 
her own. It shouldn’t be a surprise that if three people put the same amount 
of money into an account every year and earn the same results, the person 
who pays the lowest fees will have the most in assets in the end. The amazing 
part is how much those differences in fees really can make.
Simply put, you should never, ever invest in a fund that deducts either a front-
load fee (which is deducted up front from each contribution you make) or a 
back-load fee (which is deducted from your account when you sell the fund) 
from your hard-earned money. The one possible exception to this rule is if 
the only advisor that you trust in your area, for whatever reason, only works 
for commissions from funds with loads. In this case, you should give that advi-
sor the absolute minimum amount of money that is required for an account 
size (assuming that the dollar amount of the front or back load is acceptable 
to you as a fair amount to pay for the advisor’s time and advice) and then 
invest the rest of your money in other share classes of the same funds that 
do not charge a load.
The vast majority of fund families that offer funds with loads have other ver-
sions of their funds without loads and often with lower management fees. 
These funds are run in precisely the same manner as the load funds and 
are managed by the same people using the same resources. As such, they

should have nearly identical returns to load funds. If you absolutely, positively  
disregard my advice and invest in a fund with a load, make sure that any savings 
above the required minimum and, especially, any future contributions, all flow 
to the load-free version of the fund.
Are All Fees Bad?
One of the largest purveyors of indexed mutual funds (low-cost mutual funds 
that are designed to track a market index as closely as possible) has been 
running ads in newspapers and magazines for years, bemoaning the impact of 
fees on performance and touting the benefits of investing your money in their 
inexpensive index funds. If every mutual fund offered the same performance 
regardless of investment philosophy, their point would be 100% on the money. 
If two funds earn 9% per year for 10 straight years and one fund charges 1.00% 
while the other one charges 0.20%, the expensive fund will turn a $10,000 
investment into $21,589 after 10 years. The cheaper fund, meanwhile, will give 
you a portfolio value of $23,243 after 10 years—an improvement of almost 
$1,700 just from paying a lower fee on the same portfolio. All else being equal, 
a lower-fee fund will always generate a better return than a higher-fee fund 
because it will deduct less from your account every year.
Obviously, though, not all funds are equal. No one buys into a fund that charges 
a management fee of 1.00% and expects to get a return that mirrors that of  
the S&P 500. If you want the market return, then invest in an index fund.  
If, on the other hand, you believe that a given manager can consistently out-
perform the market, then a higher-fee, actively managed portfolio may be right 
for you.
Let’s reconsider the example from the prior paragraph and assume that the 
actively managed fund (before fees) outperforms the stock market by 0.50% 
every year. Unfortunately, the fund’s outperformance (0.50%) amounts to less 
than the incremental fee versus the index fund (0.80%), and the value of your 
investment at the end of 10 years is $22,610. That’s better than the high-fee 
fund mentioned, but it is still $600 less than would have been earned in the 
index fund. If the manager can add 2% of value to the fund every single year, 
though, you can start to see the real benefits of active management. That 
2% outperformance less the 1% fee yields an after-fees annual return of 10%, 
whereas the index fund is only returning 8.8% (9% market return less 0.20%) 
after its fee. Now the actively managed portfolio is worth $25,937 after 10 
years, which is $2,700 better than the index fund.
In answer to the question posed, then, no. Not all fees are necessarily bad. If an 
investment manager can actually deliver performance that is 2% better than 
the benchmark every single year, that is something that is worth paying for.  

Chapter 9 | Fees and Expenses 
172
In theory, if I have 100% certainty that the manager will always deliver 2% 
above the benchmark, I should be willing to pay any fee up to 2.19% for a net 
annual return of 8.81%. After all, my alternative to this fund is the index fund, 
which will return 8.80% per year after fees.
As I showed in Chapter 7, however, finding managers that can deliver precisely 
2% of outperformance year after year, in good markets and in bad, is a tall 
order. The data I shared in that chapter might probably (and rightfully) lead 
you to conclude that this type of outperformance is impossible. Although it 
very well could be the case that you could find SOME mutual fund in some 
asset class that has had at least 2% outperformance every year for some 
10-year period, it is difficult to imagine that this fund’s perfect track record 
will continue for another 10 years.
Finding a balance between a reasonable expectation of outperformance and 
the fees that you are willing to pay for that outperformance becomes the key 
driver of the decision regarding whether you will choose an actively managed 
fund or go with a low-cost index option. Although I cannot give you a hard 
and fast rule for how to find that balancing point, you need to consider how 
successful you think the manager will be in the future, how reasonable that 
performance is in light of other alternatives, how much the fund charges in 
fees, how that fee compares to the fees of the fund’s peers, and how willing 
you are to stay with that fund when it inevitably underperforms. Even the best 
funds might underperform for 3 or 4 out of every 10 years. Are you willing to 
continue to stay with those funds bearing the higher cost versus an indexed 
alternative, as long as the manager’s style is out of favor? If you don’t think 
that you will have the courage of your convictions to ride out the full market 
cycle, you may find yourself buying at the top of a manager’s outperformance 
record and then paying high fees right down to the bottom, when you finally 
throw in the towel, sell, and invest in another highflyer that is perfectly timed 
for its own underperformance.
I will give you one caveat to all this “lower fees are better advice”: even very 
large investors have their vision clouded by fee comparisons sometimes, and 
I advise you not to let fees and expenses become the be-all and end-all of 
your mutual fund selection process. Paying 0.10% higher in fees for a fund that 
returns 1.0% more than its peers can be a good deal, as long as you have con-
fidence that the 1.0% outperformance will persist. Whereas the lower cost of 
two identical funds is usually the better choice, try to choose between actively 
managed funds, if that is what you want, based on how much you believe in the 
manager’s approach, the likelihood that the strategy will do well in the future, 
and how the fund fits your overall investment strategy. A cheaper fund may 
serve you less well over the long run if the performance advantage of a higher-
priced fund exceeds the incremental cost.

173
Diversification and Fees
Up to this point in this chapter, I have discussed whether higher fees for a 
single fund versus an indexed alternative are worth it. Meanwhile, the rest of 
the advice in this book clearly says that you should never put all your eggs in 
one basket and should be as diversified as possible. If you are investing in sev-
eral different asset classes and plan to include a few mutual funds in each asset 
class in your portfolio, it is very possible that you could quickly find yourself 
with investments in six or more mutual funds at the same time.
As thin as the odds are that any fund could outperform every single year, the 
chances that every fund you select will always outperform are exponentially 
more remote. (Frankly, based on my experience, I would say that it is impos-
sible for every fund an investor selects to outperform its benchmark every 
single year.) As a result, with a sufficiently broad selection of funds, it is likely 
that outperformance by some funds in some years will be at least partially 
offset by underperformance by others, resulting in a total portfolio that could 
underperform the market as a whole. Remember, whereas the sum of all 
fixed income managers may not necessarily equal the entire bond market (see 
Chapters 5 and 6), the sum of the portfolios of 20 large cap stock managers 
will be virtually the same as the companies constituting any major index. As 
a result, in aggregate those 20 portfolios will generate a market return for 
you, less the average active management fee the funds charge, leaving you far 
­better off simply buying as cheap an index fund as you can find.
As I discussed previously in this book, it is therefore imperative to selectively 
decide where you want to take, and pay for, active risk. An investor might 
select indexed large cap funds, active small cap funds, indexed non-US funds, 
aggressive emerging markets funds, and active fixed income funds based on 
the advice I’ve given—not a bad combination of funds. In this example, inves-
tors are paying high fees where they think that their managers can add value 
and paying low-cost index fees where they think they will just earn the market 
return. By using a select number of active managers and indexing the rest, 
investors increase their chances of outperforming the market versus inves-
tors that select four high-fee, actively managed mutual funds in every asset 
class and hope for the best.
Breakpoints
Many mutual fund companies offer different classes of shares based not just 
on whether or not the funds carry a load but also on the amount the client is 
willing to invest in a given fund. As you develop your asset allocation plan, you 
should give prime consideration to whether greater diversification results in 
higher expenses.

Chapter 9 | Fees and Expenses 
174
When a pension plan is considering investing in an institutional portfolio, a fee 
structure for a given fixed income portfolio might look like the following:
0.40% on the first $25 million
• 
0.30% on the next $25 million
• 
0.25% on the next $50 million
• 
0.20% on any amount above $100 million
• 
Let’s say the client has $300 million to invest in fixed income and several good 
manager candidates to choose from. If the client gives the entire investible 
amount to a single manager, they will incur a large amount of idiosyncratic 
risk5 associated with that investment but will pay a fee of only 0.23%, or 
$700,000 per year. If the client selects two managers that offer the same fee 
schedule, they diversify the risk of any given manager, but each manager’s fee 
increases to 0.27%, or a total of $800,000 per year. If the client splits their 
investment three ways, they must pay an average manager fee of 0.30%, or a 
total of $900,000.
The client’s lack of conviction in a single manager and selection of three dif-
ferent fixed income managers results in an annual increase of $200,000 in fees 
and lower exposure to underperformance by any individual manager. However, 
it also results in lower exposure to outperformance by any ­individual manager 
and a better chance that at least one poor performer in any given year will 
negatively offset the good performance of the others. By hiring three manag-
ers instead of one, the client is paying more money for less performance in any 
given year—but reduces the risk that their entire portfolio will completely 
melt down.
Although not many people make $300,000,000 investment decisions, this 
thought exercise still applies to the individual investor. Even for smaller asset 
sizes, fee breakpoints still exist. For individual investors, mutual funds are 
often offered in a variety of share classes with different minimum investment 
amounts and management fees. For example, a large, well-known index fund 
manager charges 0.17% for accounts over $3,000 and 0.05% for accounts 
over $10,000 in one index fund. A household-name fixed income firm charges 
0.75% for assets over $2,500 and 0.50% for accounts of more than $100,000 
in one of its flagship products. When you decide how many investment man-
agers you need in a risk-controlled portfolio, that 0.12% or 0.25% increase 
in fees by selecting more, smaller portfolios might really start to add up and 
5A really fancy way of saying “manager-specific” risk. In other words, the risk that the 
manager does a terrible job all alone and underperforms the market and the manager’s 
peers due to specific stock picks, industrial sector weights, excessive trading, or anything 
else that creates a uniquely poor return for just this manager.

impact your returns. Or, you might decide that those are minimal costs to 
bear to reduce the impact that a single manager might have during a period of 
catastrophic underperformance.
As was the case for our pension plan example, you need to balance your 
desire for diversification against the cost of diversification. It may be scary to 
put all of your money in a single bond fund. If you don’t, though, and instead 
choose to split your investment between two managers, you could miss the 
opportunity to take advantage of the breakpoint between two share classes, 
which will increase your fees by a significant amount every year. Is that a cost 
you are willing to bear to have less fear that one of your funds will underper-
form? On the other hand, if you are so concerned that one of your funds will 
blow up that you need to pay more to diversify that risk by investing in peer 
funds, should you invest in it in the first place? Maybe the fact that the risk is 
so scary to you that you feel you must diversify it away should guide you in 
your decision to find other funds that let you sleep easier at night.
Likewise, you can invest $10,000 in the S&P 500 index fund and pay a fee of 
0.05% per year, or you can put half of that $10,000 in the index fund and the 
other half in two growth and value actively managed funds. Not only will you 
pay significantly higher fees for those two active funds, but the cost of the 
index fund portion of your portfolio will increase by 0.12%. Are you suffi-
ciently convinced that those two active managers are worth that incremental 
cost? At the end of the day, both pension plans and individual investors need 
to perform the same balancing act between the number of funds they feel they 
need to have in their portfolio to properly diversify their risks, the incremen-
tal cost of adding more funds to their portfolio, and the probability that having 
too many funds leaves them with a high-cost mess that cannot outperform in 
aggregate.
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
Pension plans can have huge cash flows both into and out of the funds in 
which they are invested. For a very large plan, monthly contributions from 
the government entity that sponsors the plan or monthly benefit payments to 
beneficiaries can amount to inflows and outflows of hundreds of millions or 
even billions of dollars a year. No plan wants to wait until the last minute to 
sell securities to raise $2 billion or more, and so pension plans will often keep 
large amounts of cash that was recently received or awaiting disbursement in 
cash form instead of investing it in stocks, bonds, or other investments.
Unfortunately, though, if a plan holds, say, 2% in cash instead of remaining fully 
invested in its target asset allocation strategy, that cash can act as a drag on 
returns. If stocks are up 10% and bonds are up 5% over some period of time, 
but cash returns only 0.10%, the pension plan will underperform its bench-
mark and targets, all else being equal, due to that “cash drag.” As a result,  

Chapter 9 | Fees and Expenses 
176
plans will often buy derivatives contracts, like stock and bond futures, which 
are highly liquid and closely track the index returns, to “equitize” (convert 
into an equivalent market exposure) their cash and eliminate the negative 
impact that holding cash can have on performance.
In some cases, instead of making actual investments in stocks, pension plans 
skip over “physical securities” altogether and instead invest in futures. After 
all, if the futures contract is designed to track the return of the stock mar-
ket almost perfectly, then why bother trading actual stocks, which are much 
less liquid? What’s more, investing in futures in place of stocks allows a pension 
plan to reduce the cash drag in its portfolios at the same time that it makes 
it easy to convert to cash when the time comes to distribute disbursements. 
True, there are some costs and complexities involved in buying futures, but 
for some clients the costs are roughly equivalent to what it costs to manage 
the physical stock portfolio.
This brings us to the personal investor and how this pension plan strategy 
translates to the individual level. Unfortunately, investing in futures is prob-
ably beyond the reach of most individuals. Individual stock and Treasury bond 
futures contracts are priced in the hundreds of thousands or millions of dol-
lars. A single S&P 500 futures contract could exceed the value of your entire 
life’s savings. This is precisely why these types of investments are perfect for 
large pension plans: if they need to turn $100 million of cash into a short-term 
market exposure, they can do it by buying less than 85 derivatives contracts 
at the time of this writing. Fortunately, however, there is a roughly equivalent 
instrument to futures for individual investors: ETFs.
ETFs, short for exchange traded funds, are very similar to typical mutual funds 
but trade on stock exchanges and carry different legal requirements. Due to 
how they are structured, ETFs often have lower fees than even index funds—
although buying some ETFs can incur commission costs, depending on which 
ETF you buy and who you use for a broker. ETFs are available from a wide and 
increasing variety of providers and can offer the investor a broad selection of 
market and other exposures, ranging from large cap indexed stocks to crazy 
structures, like 200% levered portfolios that profit when treasury bonds fall 
in price (and rates rise). Due to the market liquidity of these instruments, 
though, they are far more appropriate for individual investors than they are 
for large pension plans. If a pension plan needed to buy $500 million worth 
of large cap stock exposure and was given the choice of trading 450 futures 
contracts or 10 million shares of an ETF at $50 a share, clearly the futures 
contract is the more efficient instrument for a huge investor.
Because ETFs normally trade on stock exchanges, you may need to pay broker-
age commissions to transact, depending on your broker and the ETF producer. 
However, the lower management fees of ETFs may offset those commissions 
if you have a long-term strategy. The ETFs from one major provider of index 
funds, for example, might cost you 0.05% less per year than their indexed 

Invest Like an Institution
177
mutual funds do. If you are investing $10,000 in one of their ETFs and have 
to pay $10 per transaction, that transaction fee is 0.10% of your investment 
amount. If you plan to hold that investment for a long time, after 2 years you 
will have saved more money on management fees than you lost from commis-
sions. However, if you plan to change your asset allocation every three months 
(see Chapter 2 for advice against doing that!), then you are probably better 
off with a mutual fund because the higher management fees will cost you less 
incrementally than all those $10 transactions costs—which, if you trade a lot, 
can add up awfully fast. Remember that selling one ETF and buying another 
through a broker that charges a commission for ETF trades incurs a total of 
$20 from two discrete transactions—which, in this example, amounts to four 
years’ worth of savings from using ETFs instead of mutual funds.
In some cases, your bank or broker might offer their own in-house ETFs 
and will let you transact for free, like some discount brokerage firms do. It is 
up to you to compare the expense ratios of those proprietary ETFs against 
ETFs offered by other companies, keeping in mind your asset allocation and 
investment style, to see if you are better off paying more in transactions 
costs or in management fees to minimize the overall cost to you.
Summary
The most important thing to bear in mind when looking at what it will cost 
you to implement your investment strategy is that fees and expenses can 
impact your investment bottom line often as much as manager performance 
does. Frequent trading or a reliance on multiple money managers for the same 
strategy can lead to far higher costs than those incurred with a long-term  
buy-and-hold strategy or a portfolio of fewer money managers.
More important, though, than the fees involved in mutual funds and ETFs is 
the understanding that the investment industry is a business. It is designed to 
make money for those who work in it. This is not a charity. As long as you 
understand that premise and work diligently to find service providers that 
actually work on your behalf, as opposed to just their own, you will be ahead 
of the legions of investors who simply trust the fast talking, convincing guy in 
the nice suit with the slick hair. Before you work with anyone as an advisor 
or investor on your behalf, make sure that you understand exactly what they 
will be charging you both today and in the future, how they make their money 
off of your assets, and whether their interests are aligned with your goals of 
long-term steady growth or simply their own financial goals.

Management
Avoiding the Unexpected
Throughout this book, I have described many of the basic errors investors 
make that cause harm to their portfolios and diminish their returns over time. 
In Chapter 2, for example, I discussed the problems that undisciplined sav-
ings, changes to your expected cash needs in retirement, and asset allocation 
strategies that ignore the long term can present. Chapters 3 and 4, meanwhile, 
listed the many uncompensated risks that can impact your portfolio when you 
allow your judgment to be clouded by size, style, and home country biases. 
Chapter 7 showed how inconsistent even the best managers can be when 
it comes to outperforming their benchmarks, and Chapter 9 illustrated the 
point that fees and expenses can drain your savings and long-term growth over 
time. In other words, I’ve spent a good portion of this book discussing the  
various risks that can negatively impact investors’ portfolios and, by extension, 
their returns in the long run.
In this chapter, I will tackle the subject of risk management head on and review 
some of the major risks that arise in portfolios that do not generate com-
pensating returns. I will also give a few real-world examples of mistakes that 
investors make to illustrate how to better guard yourself against following 
suit. Although I have waited to directly address risk management until now, 
keep in mind as you read this chapter that this all-important topic needs to be 
something that every investor considers both periodically, when major finan-
cial decisions are made, and continuously, as investments are monitored.

The Road Map to Financial Success graphic may indicate that managing risk 
is a single step on the path to retirement security, but, as was the case with 
the fees and expenses that it costs you to implement your plan that were 
discussed in Chapter 9, risk management really should be an overarching disci-
pline. As you develop your asset allocation strategy, your asset structures, and 
your manager selections, you should consider the risk of each step as you go. 
Then, periodically you should look at the big picture of your investments and 
see if anything sticks out. Does something keep you up at night? Does it seem 
like 50% of your returns or problems are coming from one single investment? 
If so, you need to consider whether the cause of all that trouble is sufficiently 
valuable that it really ought to be included in your portfolio. In practice, it 
seldom is worth the trouble.
People in the medical profession adhere to a code of conduct that begins, 
“First, do no harm.” That is also a terrific rule of thumb for handling your own 
investments. If you can avoid making basic mistakes that will cost you money 
over time, you will be far better off in the end than you will be if you fiddle 
with things, even with the best of intentions, to the point that you are a detri-
ment to your own results.
For Most Investors, Diversification is a Must
Andrew Carnegie once said, “The way to become rich is to put all your eggs in 
one basket and then watch that basket.” If your dream path to retirement is to 
open a store, start a restaurant, or launch a product that you hope will gener-
ate the wealth you require, I wish you all the luck in the world. Risking every-
thing for a dream can be a noble pursuit and can have tremendous financial 
and personal rewards, as long as the dreamer understands the potential costs 
and consequences of failure. For everyone who lacks the ability to control 
their own destiny, though, diversification of their investments is a must. Sure, 
Mr. Carnegie grew fantastically rich by watching his basket of one investment, 
but that investment, over which he had complete control, was U.S. Steel. 
(Not to mention that he also had a virtual monopoly over the steel output of 

181
Invest Like an Institution
an entire country at the very beginning of the Industrial Revolution.) For an 
individual investor who follows Carnegie’s one basket advice and puts 100% 
of his investments into an S&P 500 index fund, however, it really doesn’t mat-
ter how much you “watch that basket.” You can’t will the S&P 500 to go up or 
down on your command. As a result, for those investors who are amassing 
wealth through steady contributions into a retirement account and disciplined 
asset allocation, fundamentals that were discussed in Chapter 2, diversification 
across a wide variety of strategies and asset classes is the best way to reduce 
the risk of any one investment costing you your future.
Figure 10-1 shows what is referred to as the efficient frontier in asset alloca-
tion. The curved and upward sloping line indicates the expected return and 
risk for a variety of combinations of assets and shows the most optimal return 
tradeoff for any given level of risk.1 At the far end of the line are combina-
tions of mostly cash and fixed income investments, where expected returns 
and expected risk are both fairly low. The portfolios that make up the upper 
right part of the line would be comprised mainly of stocks, private equities, 
and other risky assets. Note that the line is not straight and has an upward 
bulge in the middle. This indicates that diversification, or having a portfolio 
that combines both risky assets and safer assets, changes the relationship 
between risk and return and leads to the potential for better outcomes than 
more concentrated portfolios do.
1When selecting an asset allocation strategy, the most common measure of risk at the 
total portfolio level is the standard deviation of returns. If your expected return is, for 
example, 7% with a standard deviation of 12%, your returns in two out of every three 
years should be between -5% and +19% (7% plus or minus 12%). In one out of every three 
years, your returns should be worse than -5% or better than 19%—which is a very inexact 
projection. As a result, asset allocation mixes need to be selected with the very long term 
in mind, allowing exceptionally good or bad years to offset each other over time. While 
it is virtually impossible to project the expected return for a portfolio in advance for any 
given year, experts can predict what some diversified portfolios should return on average 
over a decade or more with a reasonable level of accuracy.

Chapter 10 | Risk Management
182
Since the line represents the most optimal portfolio at any given level of risk 
and return, a portfolio that plots above the efficient frontier line is simply 
impossible. While we all would love to live in a world where 15% returns 
are possible with a minimum of risk, that data point would be above and to 
the left of the line and therefore, as I just said, impossible. An asset allocation 
combination that resulted in a point below the line is entirely possible, with a 
lower payoff in expected return per unit of risk taken, and would reveal that 
the investor could increase return at the same level of risk all the way up to 
the efficient frontier, or decrease risk at a constant level of return, again mov-
ing to an optimal asset allocation combination that is on the efficient frontier.
In Figure 10-2, using the 2012 return, risk, and correlation asset class assump-
tions from a major investment consulting company, I plot the expected return 
and risk for a variety of portfolios, ranging from 50% global stocks and 50% 
bonds to 100% global stocks and 0% bonds in 10% increments. As you can 
see, whereas the 100% stock asset allocation mix has the highest expected 
return, it also has the highest risk, as measured by the standard deviation of 
that return. For an aggressive investor with a long time horizon and a healthy 
appetite for risk, decreasing an allocation to stocks by 10% or 20% retains a 
fairly high expected return at 7% per year or better but leads to a dramatic 
decrease in expected risk. The change from a 100% stock and 0% bond port-
folio to an 80% stock and 20% bond portfolio decreases expected return by 
0.80%, from 7.80% to 7.00%, but it also decreases expected risk from 17.05% 
to 13.85%. That’s more than three percentage points of risk reduction for less 
than one percentage point of expected return.

In Figure 10-3, I have added small allocations to real estate investment trusts 
(REITs) and high yield bonds to spread the risk from two eggs in the hypo-
thetical basket to four eggs. The advantages of greater diversification are obvi-
ous; both new plotted portfolios, as well as the entire range of outcomes, have  
a higher expected return and a lower expected risk than the comparable 
stock/bond-only portfolios.

The portfolio that is 80% invested in stocks, 10% invested in REITs, and 10% 
invested in high yield, for example, holds 90% of its assets in stock-like invest-
ments, counting REITs as an equity investment. That portfolio’s expected 
return is about 0.10% higher than the 90% stock and 10% bond portfolio, and 
its expected standard deviation is 0.65% lower—which is exactly the kind of 
improvement you should be seeking. One of my clients likes to say, “When 
someone offers you a free lunch, eat it!” As an investor, the free lunch that 
you should be looking for is the opportunity to simultaneously decrease your 
risk while increasing your returns. This is the best possible outcome of an 
asset allocation decision-making process, and it is also the very definition of 
risk management.
The bottom line is that being diversified across many asset classes instead 
of just one or two is the single best way to reduce your portfolio’s total 
risk, as diversification will minimize the risk exposure you face from any one 
investment.
Beware of False Diversification
Despite the many benefits of diversification, all investors do need to beware of 
the risks of adding diversification just for the sake of diversification. What do I 
mean by this? Let me give you an example. In 2006 and 2007, in the aftermath of 
the recession and market collapse that occurred during the 2001–2003 period,

Invest Like an Institution
many investors diligently tried to spread their risk across a wide variety of invest-
ments in order to limit the damage that any particular investment could do to 
their overall portfolio. By 2008, many large pension plans and other large inves-
tors held investments in US stocks, non-US stocks, emerging markets stocks, 
private equities, opportunistic real estate, value-added real estate, non-US real 
estate, hedge funds, commodities, and high yield bonds, as well as fixed income, 
cash, core real estate, and/or REITs. Some investors were allocated to 10 or 
more different asset classes and consequently felt as though they were suffi-
ciently diversified to weather any storm.
Then, the credit crisis of 2008 happened, and all risky assets saw their values 
drop in lockstep. No matter whether an investor was invested in US stocks, 
emerging markets stocks, or private equities, every asset class except Treasury 
bonds decreased in value, including many cash money market funds. Whereas 
a seemingly diversified portfolio would have protected the investor from an 
isolated crisis in one or two asset classes, the lesson of 2008 was that the 
global financial markets are far more interconnected than they were widely 
believed to be. The interest rates required for any bank loans or non-Treasury 
debt skyrocketed, putting pressure on fixed income values and real estate 
investments that needed financing. The stock market value of banks around 
the world fell dramatically due to the declines in the values of the assets that 
they owned or claimed as collateral, leading to a further increase in rates 
and a decrease in lending. This caused the global economy to slow into a 
recession, making all other public and private equities fall in value as a result.  
As consumers started losing their jobs and saw their borrowing capacity 
decline, their interest in buying real estate fell to zero, leading to a downward 
spiral in the values of real estate investments and a further decline for the 
financial institutions who loaned money to real estate purchasers. And so the 
spiral continued.
Investors who thought that their allocations across 10 or 12 different asset 
classes would protect them from a broad decline found that the value of their 
treasury bonds increased (as they usually do in a crisis) while that of virtually 
every other asset class fell. Their great diversification was a myth.
The New Way to Manage Asset Class Risk
Out of the experience of the 2008 credit crisis came a new way of looking at 
asset allocation and risk management that is directly applicable to all investors, 
both large and small. Instead of determining a proper allocation to US stocks, 
non-US stocks, and emerging markets stocks as if each was truly a distinct 
asset class, many investors have shifted to a new paradigm wherein they allo-
cate assets according to the purpose to each type of asset and then lump 
a variety of asset classes together accordingly. For example, public equities, 
private equities, high yield bonds, and higher-risk real estate generally generate  

Chapter 10 | Risk Management
186
good returns when the economy is expanding and poor returns when it is 
contracting. As a result, these assets could be thought of as the “growth” 
portion of a portfolio. Meanwhile, investment-grade fixed income invest-
ments, especially treasuries, tend to hold up better when the economy slows 
because interest rates fall and (as was discussed in Chapter 5) the prices of 
bonds correspondingly rise. Accordingly, these assets could be thought of as 
the “income” or “safety” portion of a portfolio. Finally, commodities, income-
producing (core) real estate, and inflation-protected bonds like TIPS should 
perform better when growth is stagnant or positive but inflation is rising.  
As such, these assets could be thought of as the “inflation protection” portion 
of a portfolio.
Under this new paradigm, investors assess the risks that they see in the mar-
ketplace or the amount of risk they are willing to tolerate in their portfolio. 
Let’s say that you are eight years away from retirement, are starting to think 
about de-risking your portfolio, and are concerned about the prospect of ris-
ing inflation. Based on your own personal understanding of the likelihood of 
various market events coming to pass or your asset size and cash flow needs 
in retirement, you might decide that you want to allocate 20% of your port-
folio to inflation protection, 30% to income production, and 50% to growth. 
Other allocation categories could include “safety,” wherein you make invest-
ments solely in short-term treasuries; “home runs,” wherein you make invest-
ments in micro-cap technology companies to replicate venture capital returns; 
or whatever other categories you wish to define that help you to better 
understand and manage how your money is invested. Either with or without 
the help of a financial advisor, you can then determine how to fill each of 
those allocation “buckets,” “themes,” “categories,” or however else you wish 
to think of these functional definitions of your investments.
Maybe you agree with me (see Chapter 8) that commodities are an uncon-
vincing opportunity for a long-term buy-and-hold investor, so you invest half 
of the inflation-protected portion of your assets in TIPS and the other half in 
REITs. For the income-producing category, maybe you believe that it is most 
appropriate to keep 25% of that allocation in high-quality, shorter-duration 
fixed income and 5% in high-income REITs. Next, let’s say you apportion 40% 
of your growth allocation in global public stocks, 5% in high yield, and 5% in 
growth-oriented REITs. At the end of the day, all three buckets have an allo-
cation to REITs because REITs have some of the characteristics of each of 
your buckets, resulting in a total allocation of 20% of your assets to the REIT 
asset class; but those three allocations all have different and understandable 
purposes.
The end result of this category-based asset allocation planning process, ideally, 
should generate a similar outcome to what I discussed in Chapter 2. However, 
for those of you who prefer a more qualitative way of understanding how 
you are allocating their money and minimizing your exposure to risk, this 

187
Invest Like an Institution
approach toward risk management may allow you to sleep easier at night, 
knowing that your asset  allocation plan is specifically designed to counter 
those risks that most concern you. As macroeconomic events warrant or 
your life plan changes (marriage, divorce, children, new job, inheritance, etc.), 
you can shift your assets among these various categories in a way that makes 
sense to you, bearing in mind my guidance from Chapter 2 to invest for, and 
keep in mind, the very long-term horizon.
Other Risks to Avoid
There are a wide variety of other risks that investors face in the marketplace, 
and no investor is immune to all of them. In this section, I will outline a handful 
of major risks that I have seen my clients face over the years and discuss the 
best ways to minimize their impacts or damage.
Churning Managers
In Chapter 7, I illustrated how difficult it is for any investment manager to 
consistently outperform the majority of his peers and a broad market index 
year after year after year. Even the most talented and well-resourced invest-
ment managers will have periods in which their investment philosophy simply 
does not work. A manager that is fantastic at finding the true underlying 
value of companies will generate great results during periods in which value 
stocks outperform growth stocks and the market is focused on deep fun-
damental research; but that manager will underperform when speculation 
and momentum drive the prices of securities with no connection to reality.  
Over long periods of time, I would expect that if the investment manager truly 
is skilled at stock selection, she or he will create value for clients, allowing for 
years here and there where the investment approach employed simply does 
not work.
It is during those poor performance times when investors stand to lose the 
most money. Let’s say a mutual fund has performed terribly in recent years, 
lagging most of its peers and the index by several percentage points. If you 
don’t sell the mutual fund and move your money somewhere else, you will 
lose even more if the fund continues to fall. If you do sell that fund and invest 
in another fund, however, you stand to lose if the original fund recovers and 
your new fund cannot continue the recent success that attracted you to it 
and falls in value.
What is an investor to do?
Most large institutional investors write investment policy statements that gov-
ern their decision making processes for asset allocation, manager selection, 
and so on. These policies provide a way for the organization to maintain 

Chapter 10 | Risk Management
188
continuity in its investment philosophy as investment committee members 
or employees come and go. They also provide legal protection for invest-
ment decisions that were entirely well-intentioned but produce lower-than-
expected results. As long as a good policy is in place, a prudent decision that 
complies with the policy but ends up losing money can protect the investment 
committee from liability because they acted in accordance with their govern-
ing rules and lost money from a market movement or an unlucky outcome, 
not an imprudent decision.
In many of these policies, the pension plans that I work with have also writ-
ten clear guidelines for when to fire and replace underperforming investment 
managers. The time frames vary from client to client somewhat, but gener-
ally large institutional investors will designate an underperforming investment 
manager as being “on watch” after one to three years of underperformance. 
Then, the client will closely monitor the manager’s performance for another 
six to twelve months. If, at the end of that entire time period, nothing has 
improved, the client will undertake an effort to replace the investment man-
ager. Keep in mind that there is nothing magical about a one- to three-year 
period. I have one client that uses a five-year rule and another that uses a rule 
of two consecutive underperforming years. The point is that each client has 
disciplined guidelines that they follow that overrule any emotion they might 
bring to the table when confronted by an underperforming manager. In every 
case, the formal process for making changes reduces the amount of rapid 
turnover, or churn, in the portfolio that can lead to compounding underper-
formance over time.
It is far too easy to watch a mutual fund in your portfolio generate a terrible 
one-year performance number, panic, and replace the investment manager a 
few months before that manager becomes the best performer of the subse-
quent year. If the fund is down, you cannot undo the damage that has been done 
and recoup your losses. All you can do is make your best guess about how 
performance will fare in the next period. The point of these watch-list periods 
is precisely to slow down the process of deciding to replace a manager. It takes 
a year or two or three of poor performance to place a manager on watch, then 
another year to monitor the manager for a recovery. If no improvements are 
made while the manager is on watch, then—and only then—is the manager 
replaced. As I discussed in Chapter 7, it can be very difficult to discern which 
managers are truly terrible and which are simply unlucky in any given quarter 
or year. Taking a reasonable amount of time to consider if a manager should 
be replaced allows for random variance in returns to filter out and a clearer 
picture to emerge that reveals whether the manager is truly skilled or not.
I recommend that you pick a time frame for your own pain threshold, starting 
with maybe a two-year review period, before placing your investment manag-
ers on your own watch list. Then take another year to see if they begin to 
recover. If you find after a cycle or two that you are constantly adding and 

189
Invest Like an Institution
deleting managers from your watch list due to the lumpiness of returns over 
any two-year period, try lengthening your time frame to three years or more. 
Although some investment managers really do make a permanent change from 
good to bad (due to changes in staff or a loss of a competitive advantage ver-
sus their peers) and honestly need replacement, I think you will find that most 
of the underperformance of formerly great managers is a transient result of 
market volatility, not a change in skill level—in which case, your patience may 
be rewarded with subsequent improvement.
The Exceptions to the Watch List Rule
The watch list process and time frames discussed previously should guide 
you through the process of evaluating whether to keep or replace invest-
ment managers that have normal periods of outperformance and underper-
formance. Keep in mind, though, that the application of long time frames for 
review does not apply in every case.
If performance is bad and the portfolio manager quits, half the firm is laid off, 
or three-quarters of the investment manager's product lines are shut down, 
you should not wait before deciding to move on. The company, the invest-
ment process, and the resources available to the portfolio management team 
have changed and no longer resemble what attracted you to this investment 
in the first place. Although it is entirely possible that the fund could bounce 
back, there are plenty of other great managers out there that are working in 
more stable organizations. The watch-list process is not intended to make 
you wait to see whether poor performance that results from, or causes, major 
organizational changes is a random occurrence. Similarly, if members of the 
team or organization are found to have broken securities regulations or other 
laws, get out immediately. Pension plans and endowments have no tolerance 
for these sorts of legal improprieties, and neither should you. Whereas many 
pension plans and endowments might take a week,  a month, or even a calen-
dar quarter to set up a meeting, discuss, vote, and then terminate a manager, 
you can react more quickly and sell a fund in a day—and you could be better 
served by being first out the door than the last.
Here is a real-world, worst-case scenario that illustrates when it may be 
appropriate to fire a manager quickly, without allowing for a long watchlist 
review period. A few years ago, a large investment manager reported to cli-
ents that it was replacing several key individuals because they had found a 
significant error in their computer-driven investment process and had hidden 
it from management for several months. Following the internal revelation of 
the programming problems, the company management then took another six 
months to terminate these individuals and inform clients about the errors. 
Within a matter of several weeks, the firm’s assets dropped by more than  
90% as virtually every client ended their relationship with this manager based

on the perception of misplaced trust from the long delays before revealing 
what had happened. As much as I had admired this particular manager’s cut-
ting-edge research and portfolio construction process in the past, I agreed 
with my clients that trust comes first, so I helped them all through the ter-
mination and replacement process far more quickly than would have been 
allowed under the usual watchlist process.
As an investor in daily-valued mutual funds, you have a significant advantage 
over many large institutional investors because you can be out of a fund by 
the end of a given day. When necessary and appropriate, I strongly urge you 
to use that to your benefit.
Getting Scared
A 2012 study by Goldman Sachs showed that if you were fully invested in the 
stock market from 1992 to 2011, your annual return would have been 7.81%. 
If you were out of the market for the ten best days (which amounts to only 
one day every two years over that 20-year period), your returns would have 
been 4.14%. Without the best 40 days, you would have returned -2.31%; and 
without the best 70 days, you would have lost -7.20%.2 Various other stud-
ies over the years from firms like Putnam Investments3, Franklin Templeton 
Investments4, and GE Asset Management5 have used different time periods, 
different methodologies, and different numbers of missed days, but they have 
all reached generally the same conclusion: if you are not invested in a small 
handful of specific days over long periods of time, your returns can be radically 
impacted. In fairness, there have been a number of studies that have pointed 
out the exact opposite point: if an investor misses the 10 or 20 worst days of 
market performance in a given time period, their returns can be tremendously 
improved, too6. However, since these and other studies have shown that 50% 
or more of the best days occur within a few days or weeks of the worst days, 
often as a rebound that occurs shortly after a major fall in the markets, I posit 
that the existence of terrific days has less impact on the actual behavior of 
investors than does the existence of terrible days.

Few people would ever watch the market jump up 5% in a day and sell off all 
their assets in fear that it might soon go down, thereby dodging the poten-
tially terrible day to follow (because half of all worst days follow shortly after 
a great day). However, it is human nature for investors to experience a day 
where the market is down 10% or more and want to sell off all their assets to 
protect themselves against future losses. When crashes inevitably happen, and 
they will always happen again in the future, the investor who has converted 
his investments to cash could miss that “best day” recovery shortly thereaf-
ter, assuming one comes along. As a result, the investor who sells every time 
the market significantly falls (but not when it rises) might capture half of the 
market’s good days (those that happen before the bad days) and all of the bad 
days that occur on their own.
My advice is to avoid being afraid and to stop reacting to short-term market 
movements out of fear. As I showed in Chapter 2, a diversified investor who 
rode out the 2001–2003 bear market earned back their entire portfolio value 
by 2005. Similarly, the 2008 crash and credit crisis were terrible, but many 
stock indices were close to their pre-crash highs by the middle of 2012—and 
a diversified investor would have fully recovered by about that same point 
in time. What should you do instead? Treat down days or weeks as buying 
opportunities. If you have 10 or 20 years or more until retirement and you 
are investing $500 a month regardless of the price of assets, why not invest 
$1,000 in a month when everything is half-off? If your time frame is sufficiently 
long to ride out even an extended downward market, like 2001–2003, steadily 
investing more than usual prepares your portfolio for an enhanced gain when 
markets recover.
Overconfidence
There are more than 25,000 mutual funds, 10,000 institutional-sized portfolios, 
and 8,000 hedge funds in operation in the world today, as well as hundreds 
of millions of individual investors. What are the odds that any one of those 
investors legally knows more about General Electric, Apple, or Citigroup than 
any other? Furthermore, what are the odds that any single investor has a sys-
tematic edge month after month and year after year over any other individual 
investor? I’m going to take a guess that the odds are rather low. In fact, I’m 
going to speculate that the odds that tens of millions of individual investors all 
have the ability to outperform the market and the industry professionals year 
in and year out are nil.
The stock market today is a place where rapid-trading hedge funds pay the 
stock exchanges huge fees to park their computer equipment a few feet away 
from the exchange’s computer servers to make tiny profits on every transac-
tion that crosses the market by minimizing the time that it takes for the elec-
trons to move at the speed of light through the wires into their computers, 

Chapter 10 | Risk Management
192
through their trading algorithms and software, and back to the exchange’s 
servers. If the hedge funds’ and investment banks’ computers were merely 
across the street, let alone miles away, they would be at a significant competi-
tive disadvantage because those computers that are more closely positioned 
to the exchange’s servers get to trade first. How can an individual investor 
who is trading at home, hundreds of miles away from the exchange, and using 
the relatively slow power of human thought to decide when to buy and sell 
hope to compete against a market like that? Any individual who thinks he or 
she can out-trade the professionals from the comfort of his or her couch 
is likely in for a rude awakening, regardless of what the advertisements on 
talk radio and financial television shows promise about their winning trading 
strategies.
Even with my background in the investment management and investment 
banking industries, in the past I have bought plenty of individual stocks that 
turned out to have terrific returns over the years, but I have also bought a 
few that ceased to exist. Like most people, I tended to think about those 
great performers a lot more than the losers and thought that I could repeat 
my success again and again, only to find that I earned mixed results over long 
periods of time. One reason, probably the main reason, is that by the time  
I heard something on TV or saw something in the paper that made me want 
to buy an individual stock, I probably was not in the first ten thousand people 
to act on that information. From these hard lessons, I’ve learned to follow my 
own advice to my clients that asset allocation, disciplined investment and con-
tribution strategies, and risk management have generated far better returns 
for me over the years than a few superior stock selections have when you net 
out the bad picks.
My advice to every investor is to avoid overconfidence and the accompany-
ing losses that can result when you approach the markets with cockiness.  
It is highly unlikely that an individual investor—especially one that invests on a 
part-time basis, when they are not focusing on the very real demands of their 
job, marriage, family, and friends—can consistently outperform the market as 
a whole. On the other hand, you do have control over your asset allocation, 
your contributions, and your retirement plans. You can control when you buy 
a mutual fund, sell, and rebalance. You can control the level of active risk in 
your portfolio by selecting concentrated or diversified active managers, index 
funds, and ETFs. You can control your costs. Individual investors will be much 
better served by focusing on those things that are under their control and can 
directly benefit their results.

193

Changing Retirement Goals at the Top
Closely following my advice regarding avoiding overconfidence and focusing 
on a savings and investment strategy that you can control is my recommen-
dation that you must keep a clear investment goal in mind. You should treat 
your retirement savings like you do the throttle in your car, adding more gas 
(savings) when the road gets steep, but making sure that there is always enough 
gas in the tank to get you where you need to go. As I discussed in Chapter 2, 
one of the greatest risks that any investor faces is changing their retirement 
goals without sufficient time or security to do so. It is okay to plan to retire in 
luxury, as long as you save accordingly. Extrapolating great short-term results 
to plan for the long run without sufficient contributions when times get tough 
can be very dangerous and leave you far short of your needs.
The Next Big Thing
In Nerds on Wall Street, David Leinweber described how he was able to repli-
cate the returns of the S&P 500 over a period of several years with more than 
99% accuracy based on butter production in the United States and Bangladesh, 
US cheese production, and the sheep population in the United States and 
Bangladesh.7 Although you could certainly make the argument that when eco-
nomic times are good, people buy more butter and fancy sweaters than they 
do when times are bad, that is a pretty loose connection—and the author’s 
findings reflect this fact. As the author describes, these correlations, which 
were derived from an examination of the returns of hundreds of different 
types of assets to find the best match, are far more likely to be due to ran-
dom chance than to result from a true economic relationship. In subsequent 
periods, the model’s predictive ability was virtually zero, meaning that the 
relationships that worked on paper in the past had nothing to do with subse-
quent reality.
I would love to be able to simply laugh at Dr. Leinweber’s story as an example 
of math gone mad. However, loads of actual investment products are just as 
much the result of spurious correlation (a random mathematical correlation 
with no true relationship) or a great deal of 20/20 hindsight as the butter, 
cheese, and wool example is. In fact, an entire industry seems to have sprung 
up over the last few years that is dedicated to offering clients strategies based 
on little more than past historical relationships. Using Dr. Leinweber’s brand 
of mathematical analysis, many firms offer backtested investment products 
that they claim replicate the returns of the real estate market, hedge funds, or 
private equities using stocks, bonds, and other traditional assets. While some 
7Nerds on Wall Street - Math, Machines and Wired Markets, David Leinweber, Wiley, 2009.

Chapter 10 | Risk Management
194
of these firms may have a unique insight into the market—and they may have 
even found a new way to do business—my fear is that many of these products 
look great on paper but really have no more substance than Dr. Leinweber’s 
replication of S&P returns with Bangladeshi butter and sheep.
One common example of the Next Big Thing at the time of this writing is risk 
parity. Because stocks are more volatile than bonds, even a portfolio that is 
60% stocks and 40% bonds normally will have more than 80% of its day-to-day 
risk tied to the stock market. It isn’t until a portfolio has less than 35% of its 
assets in stocks that you will start to see the share of total risk from stocks 
fall below 50%. To offset the risk that stocks pose to the average portfolio, 
a large number of investment management companies have begun to offer 
risk parity products that increase the portfolio’s total exposure to bond risk 
to the point where it becomes more comparable (on parity) with that of  
stocks. In many cases, this might mean holding 60% of your portfolio’s assets  
in stocks and another 60% of assets in bonds, using leverage to make up 
the rest. Compared to those of a traditional 60% stocks and 40% bonds or 
70% stocks and 30% bonds portfolio, the backtested and hypothetical returns 
for risk parity products look fantastic. As such, the products are being mar-
keted as a panacea to pension plans that have less in assets than they do in 
promised benefits and need to find ways to close that gap quickly.
But are risk parity products as promising as they seem? Consider the follow-
ing: Since about 1980, interest rates have been on a steady downward slide, 
and the last six years in particular have seen interest rates—especially short-
term rates—fall to all-time lows8. As I discussed in Chapter 5, this rapid and 
large decline in rates has led to tremendous gains in price for bond investors. 
In retrospect, borrowing some money and buying bonds with leverage would 
have been a fantastic machine for printing money when rates fell to near zero. 
But what happens tomorrow? Rates cannot continue to drop as much as they 
already have because there is a floor at zero. When rates rise, a leveraged 
investment in bonds could have losses compounded by that leverage. In early 
2013, for example, many risk parity portfolios suffered losses precisely as  
predicted when rates began to rise.
In fairness, some risk parity strategies have been adjusted to allow for this 
possibility in the future and now propose investing in other assets going for-
ward. Consider, for example, so-called “All Weather” strategies, which invest 
in a wide variety of asset classes to prepare a portfolio for a variety of future 
economic environments. In addition, as interest in risk parity products grows, 
the market appears to be moving away from the fantastic hypothetical and 
simulated returns that were peddled to clients in the past. Nevertheless, when 
you are confronted with a simplistic leveraged fixed income strategy, you must 
8See Figure 5-1 for more detail.

195
Invest Like an Institution
always question whether a strategy that worked so well on paper will generate 
as fantastic results in practice—even if the backtest looks fantastic. Hopefully 
the more diversified strategies will bear better results.
If the preceding paragraphs have not made my opinion on the matter clear, my 
advice to investors is to always be wary of the Next Big Thing, especially when 
it is driven by backtests. In every bull market, someone will try to sell a new 
idea that promises to get you all of the upside of the market but expose you 
to none of the downside. Then, when the next bear market inevitably rolls 
around, those optimistic bull market strategies will go the way of the dodo, 
and the new hot idea will promise to protect your money from any calamity.  
Rarely will those offering either of these ideas have any real performance his-
tory to show you, and it is unlikely that either will survive the next market 
cycle. If it truly was possible to capture all of the return and none of the risk 
in a given market, the world would be full of trillionaires. Use your best judg-
ment and invest in strategies that you can understand and agree with—not 
just those that seem foolproof on paper.
Summary
Simply put, the best way to manage and reduce your risk is to take risk only 
when it is appropriate, well-considered, and consistent with your long-term 
investment plan. There is no magic way to generate the returns that you 
need, other than by following a steady and disciplined plan of consistent sav-
ings, sticking to your long-term asset allocation targets in good markets and 
bad, and maintaining a clear idea of your end investment goals. Refraining 
from chasing a fast trend, ignoring the Next Big Thing, and staying with a man-
ager when performance lags might cause you to miss the occasional big win. 
However, doing so will also prevent you from falling into the trap of adding 
risk to your portfolio at precisely the wrong time and suffering the inevitable 
consequences.

Putting It All 
Together
Achieve your Financial Independence
Using the expert advice in this book, you have designed an asset allocation plan 
appropriate to your needs, worked your way through the question of whether 
you want indexed or active management (or some of both), determined which 
fixed income sectors you are willing to take risk in, and considered whether 
you can find alternative investments that are worth the high cost. Because 
you have worked your way through Chapter 7, you have also selected a diver-
sified—yet not excessively large—stable of portfolio managers and mutual 
funds; examined your fees and expenses for places where you can reduce 
these drags on your long-term performance; and reviewed whether the risks 
you are taking in your investments have a reasonable chance of compensating 
you in excess of what they could cost you.
You are done, right? Now you can just ride off into the sunset?

Not even close. Although the journey shown in the Road Map to Financial 
Success seems like a one-way trip, in practice it is a trip you must take over 
and over throughout your career, especially whenever your life’s circumstances 
change. Managing your portfolio well requires you to take a combination of 
big steps, like those that are shown in the Road Map to Financial Success; little 
steps, like periodic rebalancing when one asset class generates meaningfully 
different returns; and continuous steps, like monitoring your investment man-
agers for good or bad performance and organizational change on an ongoing 
basis. You never get to round the bases, jump on home plate, high-five your 
teammates, and go home. Managing your portfolio to maximize your chances 
of success is a lifelong challenge that entails a steadfast commitment to fol-
lowing closely the steps that I have outlined in this book. Instead of a base-
ball game, think of investing more like a 100-mile ultramarathon. You have 
an overall race strategy that you will need to adjust as your own progress 
and the external environment warrant; checkpoints at every mile to evaluate 
how you are doing; support when you need it from those closest to you; but, 
most unlike that baseball game, few adoring crowds to push you on your way.  
Your efforts and discipline to stay on the path must be almost entirely self-driven 
if you are going to have success.
As I have mentioned throughout this book, the world of investments is a 
competitive field. Millions of investors are looking at the same economic news, 
market returns, and multiple data points; and many of them have huge, dedi-
cated, highly trained staffs of people to do so. Therefore, I urge you to focus 
on the real advantages that you bring to the table versus many of your peers 
and even large institutions like pension plans and endowments.
First, you can take a long-term, static, unemotional approach to asset alloca-
tion that is unbiased and uninfluenced by outside forces. Your contribution 
plan and your asset allocation plan can be determined with only your own 
interests in mind, with no need to compromise between the beliefs or values 
of a variety of interested parties. In the asset allocation, investment structure, 
and manager selection chapters, I have made some pension fund trustees and 
staffs sound like patient monks, always doing the best and smartest things 
they can with every single investment decision that they make. Ideally, they 
should be unemotional and long-term focused. In practice, however, many of 
their decisions are compromises that must balance a number of competing 
considerations, not all of them purely investment related, as I discussed in 
the section that outlined how you are free to act in your own best interests 
without outside influence or compromise.
Second, you can commit to making constant contributions to your portfolio, 
even when times are good, your returns are stellar, and extra dollars into the 
retirement plan seem unnecessary but will build up a rainy day surplus to 
protect you from a market downturn. In addition, unlike some pension plans, 
you can maintain a commitment to a constant level of benefits: your eventual  

199
Invest Like an Institution
retirement plan. When your returns are good, no one pressures you to reduce 
your contributions to your savings or increase your retirement goals. You can 
keep on a steady pace, exactly as you planned. Although this sounds simple, 
it is the single greatest benefit that your independence as an investor affords 
you. As I outlined in Chapter 2 on asset allocation, keeping yourself on that 
steady path is the surest way to get to your destination.
Third, although even small pension funds have massive scale and can negotiate 
cheaper investment manager fees than the average investor, if you devote your-
self to reducing costs, you can significantly close that gap. Individual investors 
have no staff salaries to pay, investment or pension office overhead expenses, 
travel costs, and so on. In addition, whereas pension funds need to pay cus-
todial banks and record keepers large fees to house their assets, audit their 
trades, and send out their benefit checks, with a little bit of shopping you can 
find a wide variety of banks, brokerages, and mutual fund companies who will 
provide you with no-fee IRA and brokerage accounts, interest-bearing cash 
sweep accounts, and no-commission ETF or mutual fund trades. For a large 
pension plan, the external costs of these banking and recordkeeping relation-
ships can be anywhere from 0.20% to 0.50% a year, whereas all of this can be 
free for your personal account if you are willing to not only invest the time in 
doing a little comparison shopping but also undergo the headache of moving 
your assets from bank to bank or brokerage to brokerage when it is clear  
you have found a better deal. Though less than half a percentage point sounds 
like a small price to pay, it can add up to a difference of tens or even hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in final assets for a very long-term investor.
If you have taken the advice and guidance that I have presented in these pages 
to heart, I hope that you will be open to two more pieces of advice. First, 
please eradicate the language of Las Vegas from your discussions about invest-
ing. You are trying to build and secure your future. You are investing in the 
equity and debt of great corporations and profiting from their endeavors over 
meaningful periods of time. Investing should not be confused with blackjack 
or roulette. So, please, don’t “double down” on a losing position. Buy a share 
of a company, don’t place a “bet” on it. Invest in a company, don’t gamble on 
something that you know as nothing more than a three- or four-letter ticker 
symbol. These are companies that make real products and employ real people; 
they are not “names” for you to place “bets” on.
The more that you can imagine that, even on a smaller scale, you are repli-
cating the long-term, forward-looking work of great investors like Warren 
Buffett or Sir John Templeton, who have a deep understanding of what they 
are investing in and an eye toward a long time frame, the lower the churn, 
fees, expenses, and probably volatility in your portfolio will be. Pension 
plans invest to provide benefits to the old and the young, including recent 
hires in their 20s and dependents of their members who are still in their 
childhoods, which means that their financial obligation could last as long as  

Chapter 11 | Putting It All Together
200
80–100 years. You build wealth over generations like these pension plans do 
through careful planning and a disciplined execution of a suitable investment 
plan—not by hoping that the stock CNBC is hyping today is worth more 
tomorrow.
The second thing I ask is that you simply turn off the financial investment talk 
shows. Stop making their contributors and guests richer by simply follow-
ing the strategies they have already put in place and buying the stocks they 
already own, thereby bidding up the prices so they can sell at a profit. If you 
want to stay informed, read the Financial Times or Wall Street Journal to find out 
what is happening in the economy and markets. Better yet, read the Economist 
and start thinking in terms of decades and generations, not daily news cycles. 
Not only will you rest easier by not worrying about every investment decision 
you made that day, but you will give your wealth a chance to work for you and 
grow without interruption. When you reach the age that you need to finally 
draw on your resources, you can be certain that the patient, steady, disciplined, 
and lower-cost path will have served you better than a lifetime of risk, volatility, 
chasing fads, and second-guessing.

This book is dedicated to the clients with whom  
I have worked over the years. Without the experience  
I gained from working with you and from helping  
you resolve the issues you deal with every day,  
none of this would have been possible

Foreword
For more than 100 years, public and corporate defined-benefit pension plans 
have provided a secure retirement to tens of millions of people. Throughout 
stock market booms and busts, war and peace, and economic prosperity and 
famine, defined-benefit pension plans have provided a sense of security and 
stability to generations of workers and their dependents, playing a critical 
role in the social contract. Combined with personal savings and Social 
Security, pension plans have been a key part of the typical retirement model, 
commonly described as a “three-legged stool.”
Today, that stool is gradually shifting across America to balance on only 
two of those legs: Social Security and private savings, often in the form 
of a 401(k) plan or its equivalent. Corporations across the country are 
shutting down or selling off their pension plans, and many state and local 
governments are considering ways to reduce benefits or shift to something 
like 401(k) plans for their workers. New companies, even some of America’s 
most valuable and successful companies, have reached maturity during this 
period of decline in the pension industry and have chosen to offer their 
employees only defined-contribution retirement plans right from the very 
start. Accordingly, the fraction of American workers covered by a traditional 
defined-benefit pension plan has plummeted over the last few decades.
As a result of all of these changes, individual savings are more critical than 
ever before, since individual workers are now expected to take 100% 
of the responsibility for planning and saving for their own retirements. 
Unfortunately, however, most individuals lack the knowledge, tools, and 
resources to manage their retirement security as successfully as the 
professional investment experts employed at many pension plans. In most 
cases, individuals do not even have a clear idea of how much money they 
will need at retirement to provide for a secure future, leading them to delay 
or minimize their retirement contributions for years and exposing them 
and their families to the potential for severe hardship, sometimes only a few 
years after retirement. If those individuals had saved a moderate amount 
more money over their working careers and had been able to invest those 
savings even marginally more successfully, these poor outcomes could have 
been completely different.
Managed properly, the vast majority of the assets in any retirement plan, 
regardless of whether it is a defined-benefit pension plan or a personal 
defined-contribution plan, should result from a lifetime of investment returns. 

Foreword 
x
My organization, for example, the California Public Employees Retirement 
System (CalPERS), the largest defined-benefit pension plan in the United 
States, has publicly reported over the last several years that approximately 
60 to 70 cents out of every dollar paid to retirees has come from those 
investment earnings, not from taxpayer or employee contributions. This 
illustrates just how critical those investment returns can be. The difference 
in assets at the time of retirement between two people who saved identical 
amounts yet had radically different investment philosophies and strategies 
can be staggering. Often, those differences result not from an informed 
choice to save in poor-returning investments or to take on unnecessary 
levels of risk, but rather from a dearth of clear information in a sea of 
confusion. Far too often, people respond to the confusion and complexity 
of the investment industry by postponing the decision to start saving for 
retirement or by investing for a lifetime in nothing more than cash portfolios 
with terribly low interest rates.
The advice in this book is very similar to what I have observed Michael 
Schlachter delivering to clients over the years I have known him—clear and 
concise, with an emphasis first and foremost on risk reduction and cost 
savings, while keeping an eye toward the long-term horizon. Michael often 
tells his clients that while no decent return can be earned without taking 
some level of risk, not all risks are worth taking, and he repeats that advice 
in many ways throughout this book. 
As Michael demonstrates in the pages that follow, the more that you as an 
individual can emulate the strategies, tools, and tricks of the trade that a 
pension fund employs, the better the chances that your retirement will be 
as comfortable as you have hoped it will be.

Acknowledgments
My thanks go out first and foremost to Henry Jones for contributing the 
foreword to this effort, as well as for all of your advice and counsel over the 
years. My sincerest thanks also go to Nate Morrow at eVestment Alliance 
for generating many of the manager universes and data series that appear in  
the charts in this book. You and your data were a lifesaver. I would also like 
to thank Julia Bonafede, Reena Lalji, and Benkai Bouey at  Wilshire Associates 
for reviewing the content of this book, in some cases multiple times, as well 
as Michael Rush at Wilshire for directing me to Venture Economics for the 
venture capital fund and buyout fund data series; my parents, Jim and JoAnn 
Schlachter, for serving as my in-house Baby Boomer focus group; Morgan Ertel 
at Apress for believing in this effort; Rita Fernando at Apress for her editorial 
assistance; and Matt Wagner at Fresh Books for helping me to finally make 
this 7-year dream project a reality. Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt 
thanks to my beautiful wife, Christina, who worked so hard to keep this book 
balanced between confusing consultant-speak laced with industry jargon and 
something that was far too basic to be interesting. If you read this book and 
find that it is just at the right level of understanding for an individual investor 
trying to figure out how to plan their financial future, Christina is entirely  
to credit.
