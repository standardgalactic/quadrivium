About the Authors
Michael Grifﬁ s became an active trader in the mid 1980s. He fi rst traded 
commodities and precious metals after taking a commodities trading class 
as part of his MBA program at Rollins College. He turned his interest in 
trading into a profession and became a stockbroker in 1992, where he helped 
business and individuals manage investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, 
retirement plans, 401(k) employee-savings plans, and asset management 
programs. Today, he mostly trades stocks and exchange-traded funds for his 
own account.
In addition, Michael is an author and business owner and has written about 
stock trading for online audiences. Outside of the business and investment 
world, he is active in his community and volunteers his time and talents as a 
fundraiser for civic and nonprofi t organizations. 
Lita Epstein, who earned her MBA from Emory University’s Goizueta 
Business School, enjoys helping people develop good fi nancial, investing, and 
tax planning skills. She designs and teaches online courses on topics such as 
accounting, reading fi nancial reports, investing for retirement, getting ready 
for tax time, and fi nance and investing for women. She has written more than 
20 books, including Bookkeeping For Dummies and  Reading Financial Reports 
For Dummies, both published by Wiley.
Lita was the content director for a fi nancial services Web site, MostChoice.
com, and managed the Investing for Women Web site. As a Congressional 
press secretary, Lita gained fi rst-hand knowledge about how to work within 
and around the federal bureaucracy, which gives her great insight into how 
government programs work. In the past Lita has been a daily newspaper 
reporter, magazine editor, and fundraiser for The Carter Presidential Center. 
For fun, Lita enjoys scuba diving and is even certifi ed as an underwater 
photographer. She hikes, canoes, and enjoys surfi ng the Web to fi nd all its 
hidden treasures.
Christopher Cottier, BSc, MBA, is a senior investment adviser based in 
British Columbia. In 1982 he left the world of banking, where he traded foreign 
currencies, to join the investment industry in Vancouver so he could pursue 
his love of rugby. More than 25 years later, he’s still managing money and 
still playing rugby. With Betty Jane Wylie, Christopher is the coauthor of The 
Best Is Yet to Come: Enjoying a Financially Secure Retirement, a pioneering 
Canadian book on fi nancial planning. Christopher has also been the technical 
editor for other recent For Canadians For Dummies fi nancial titles.

Introduction
T
rading used to be the purview of institutional and corporate entities that 
had direct access to closed securities trading systems. Recent techni-
cal advances have levelled the playing field, making securities trading much 
more accessible to individuals. After Canada’s Bre-X Minerals scandal of 1997 
and the general stock market crash of 2000, when many people lost large 
sums of money because professional advisers or mutual fund managers didn’t 
protect their portfolio principal, investors chose between two options — getting 
out of the market altogether and seeking safety, or finding out more about 
how to manage their own portfolios. Many who came back into the market 
ran from it again in late 2008 when the market saw its worst year since the 
Great Depression.
The concept of buying and holding forever died after that 2000 stock crash; it 
saw some revival from 2004 to 2007, but then suffered another death in 2008. 
Despite Canada’s decent recovery in 2009, people are now looking for new 
ways to invest and trade. Although investors still practise careful portfolio 
balancing using a buy and hold strategy, they look much more critically 
at what they are holding and are more likely to change their holdings now 
than they were before the crash. Others have gotten out of the stock market 
completely.
Still others have moved on to the world of trading. Many kinds of traders ply 
their skills in the markets. The ones who like to take on the most risk and 
want to trade as a full-time business look to day trading. They seldom hold 
a position in a security overnight. Swing traders hold their positions a bit 
longer, sometimes for a few weeks or even a few months.
But we’re not focusing on the riskier types of trading in this book; instead, we 
focus on position trading, which involves executing trades in and out of posi-
tions and holding positions for a few weeks or months and maybe even a year 
or more, depending on trends that are evident in the economy, the market-
place, the commodity prices for Canada’s natural resources, and ultimately, 
individual stocks.

Trading For Canadians For Dummies 
About This Book
Many people have misconceptions about trading and its risks. Most people 
think of the riskiest type of trading — day trading — when they hear the 
word trader. We’re definitely not trying to show you how to day trade. We’re 
not going to show you how to trade penny stocks. Instead, we want to intro-
duce you to the world of position trading, which is much safer, less risky, and 
yet a great way to build a significant portfolio.
Don’t get the wrong idea: trading in securities always carries risks. Never 
trade with money you can’t risk losing. That means aggressive trading with 
your children’s Registered Education Savings Plan isn’t a good idea. If you 
want to trade, set aside a portion of your savings that isn’t earmarked for 
any specific use and that you believe you can put at risk without ruining your 
lifestyle.
Obviously, we plan to show you ways to minimize risk, but we can’t promise 
that you won’t take a loss. Even the most experienced traders, the ones who 
put together the best trading systems, don’t have a crystal ball and periodi-
cally get hit by a market shock and accompanying loss. By using the basics 
of fundamental and technical analyses, we show you how to minimize your 
risk, how to recognize when the market is ripe for a trade, when specific sec-
tors in the market are the right places to be, how to figure out which phases 
economic and market cycles are in, and how to make the best use of all that 
knowledge. We guide you through Canada’s many ways to invest with before-
tax dollars rather than after-tax dollars.
Foolish Assumptions
We’ve made a number of assumptions about your basic knowledge and 
stock-trading abilities. We assume you’re not completely new to the world 
of investing in stocks and that you’re familiar with the stock market and its 
basic language. We review many key terms and phrases as we explore the 
basics of trading.
We also assume you know how to operate a computer and use the Internet. If 
you don’t have high-speed access to the Internet now, be sure you do have it 
before trying to trade. Many of the resources we recommend in this book are 
available online, but you’ll need high-speed access to be able to work with 
these valuable tools.

 Introduction
How the Book Is Organized
We’ve broken this book down into six logical parts. Well, we tried anyway. 
The first focuses on tools, and then we explore the basics of fundamental 
analysis right before delving into technical analysis. After getting the basics 
out of the way, we discuss how you can use your newly discovered tools to 
develop and begin building your own strategies and trading system. Just in 
case you want to move on to riskier types of trading, we include some basic 
information about day trading, swing trading, and trading derivatives and 
foreign currency. We also include the basics of option trading, which was 
pioneered in Canada. That said, we highly recommend you seek additional 
training before trying any of the riskier forms of trading.
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: 
Gathering Your Tools
Trading is a business, and just like any other business, you need to put 
together a good set of tools to be successful. In Part I, we talk about the 
basics of trading, introduce the markets and the exchanges, discuss various 
alternatives for finding a discount broker or investment adviser and setting 
up your investment account, and describe the minimum computer hardware 
and software necessities you need to succeed as a trader. We also discuss 
your Internet needs and point you to some good basic resources on the 
Internet that can help get you started. All of Canada’s tax shelters are fea-
tured, namely the RRSP, RRIF, RESP, IPP, and TFSA.
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: 
Fundamental Analysis
Many traders don’t use fundamental analysis. They believe technical analysis 
is the only thing you need to understand. We don’t agree. You can gather 
plenty of valuable information about the economy, markets, sectors, and indi-
vidual stocks that can help you excel as a trader. We start you out with the 
economy, the basics of the business cycle, sector rotation, and various eco-
nomic indicators because they can help you make your calls. Next we show 
you how to delve into financial statements to find the crucial information 
you need to pick the companies whose stocks you want to trade. Finally, we 
talk about analysts and what information you can get and use from them and 
what you shouldn’t use. We also explain how you can listen in on analysts’ 
calls to get the most current information about a company and how execu-
tives perceive their company numbers.

Trading For Canadians For Dummies 
Part III: Reading the Charts: 
Technical Analysis
You can’t even begin to think about trading if you don’t understand technical 
analysis and how to build and read charts so you can pick entry and exit points 
when buying and selling stocks. We take you step by step through the process 
of building a chart, and we describe how to identify trends and distinguish 
between transitions from one trend to another. In this part, you find out how to 
recognize bull and bear patterns and how to differentiate between a stock that 
is range bound and one that is trending. We also introduce you to some of our 
favourite tools and give you several examples of how to use them.
Part IV: Developing Strategies for 
When to Buy and Sell Stocks
After finding out how to use the tools of fundamental and technical analyses, 
you’re ready to develop strategies for your own trading. First you need to 
explore good money discipline to avoid taking major losses and be around 
to trade for another day. You also need to determine when to stay in a posi-
tion and when to trade out of it. You certainly want to take your profits at the 
right time, but you also want to avoid standing idly by as a profit turns into a 
loss. Next we talk about how you can gather key information through funda-
mental analysis and then add the results of your technical analysis to build 
an optimum trading strategy. And we talk about the mechanics of trading 
before finally exploring how you can build your own trading system.
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise
You may want to try the riskier forms of trading, such as swing trading, day 
trading, or trading in derivatives and foreign currency. We definitely won’t 
be sharing any strategies for actually participating in these types of trading, 
but we will introduce you to the basics and warn you about what you need to 
become familiar with before entering these wilder forms of trading. Be careful 
out there and don’t get caught up in any of the many frauds and scams that 
are common with these types of trading.

 Introduction
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The final part of the book is a hallmark of the For Dummies series — the Part 
of Tens. In it, we highlight ten huge trading mistakes and ways you can avoid 
them, and we review the top ten basics you’ll need to remember for surviving 
in the world of trading.
Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies books use little pictures, called icons, to flag certain chunks of 
text. Here’s what they actually mean:
 
Watch for these little flags to get ideas on how to improve your trading skills 
or where to find other useful resources.
 
If something is particularly important for you to remember, we mark it with 
this icon.
 
The trading world is fraught with dangers and perils. A minor mistake can 
cost you a bunch of money, so we use this icon to point out particularly 
perilous areas.
 
When you see this icon, know that we’re discussing higher-end, more techni-
cal material for the experienced trader.
Where to Go from Here
You’re ready to enter the exciting world of trading. You can start anywhere 
in the book; each chapter is self-contained. But if you’re totally new to trad-
ing, starting with Chapter 1 is the best way to understand the basics. If you 
already know the basics, understand everything about the various markets 
and exchanges that you care to know, have an adviser picked out, and have 
all the tools you’ll need, you may want to start with fundamental analysis in 
Part II. Remember, though, to have fun and enjoy your trip through the excit-
ing world of trading.

M
aking lots of money is the obvious goal of most people who decide to 
enter the world of trading. How successful you become as a trader 
depends on how well you use the tools, gather the needed information, and 
interpret what you’ve got. You need to develop the discipline to apply all that 
you know about trading toward developing a winning trading strategy.
Discovering how to avoid getting caught up in the emotional aspects of 
trading — the highs of a win and the lows of a loss — is key to developing a 
profitable trading style. Trading is a business and needs to be approached 
with the same logic you’d apply in your approach to any other business deci-
sion. Setting goals, researching your options, planning and implementing 
your strategies, and assessing your success are just as important for trading 
as they are for any other business venture.
In this book we help you traverse these hurdles, and at the same time we 
introduce you to the world of trading. In this chapter, we give you an over-
view of trading and an introduction to the tools you need, the research skills 
you must use, and the basics of developing all this information into a suc-
cessful trading strategy.

Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Trading versus Investing
First, we need to discuss how trading differs from investing. Investors buy 
stocks and hold them for a long time — often too long, riding a stock all the 
way down and possibly even buying more along the way. Traders, on the 
other hand, hold stocks for as little as a few minutes or as long as several 
months, and sometimes possibly even a year or more. The specific amount of 
time depends on the type of trader you want to become.
Investors want to carefully balance an investment portfolio among growth 
stocks, value stocks, domestic stocks, and foreign stocks, along with long-, 
short-, and intermediate-term bonds. A well-balanced Canadian portfolio gen-
erally offers the investor a steady return of between 5 percent and 8 percent, 
depending on the type of investments and amount of risk he or she is willing 
to take.
An aggressive, well-balanced portfolio with a mix of 80 percent invested in 
stocks and 20 percent in bonds can average as high as a 12 percent annual 
return for investors during a 20-year period; in some years the portfolio will 
be down, and in others it will go through periods of high growth. The oppo-
site, a conservative portfolio with 20 percent invested in stocks and 80 per-
cent in bonds, is likely to provide a yield on the lower end of the spectrum, 
closer to 5 percent. The volatility and risk associated with the latter port-
folio, however, would be considerably less. Investors who have 10 or more 
years before they need to use their investment money tend to put together 
more aggressive portfolios. Those who need to live off the money tend to put 
together less aggressive portfolios that give them regular cash flows, which is 
what you get from a portfolio invested mostly in bonds.
 
As a trader, you look for the best position for your money and then set a goal 
of exceeding what an investor can otherwise expect from an aggressive port-
folio. During certain times within the market cycle, your best option may be to 
sit on the sidelines and not even be active in the market. In this book, we show 
you how to read the signals to decide when you need to be in the market, and 
how to find the best sectors in which to play the market and the best stocks 
within those sectors.
Why Trade?
Improving their potential profit from stock transactions is obviously the key 
reason why most people decide to trade. People who want to grow their 
portfolios rather than merely maintain them hope that the way they invest 

11
 Chapter 1: The Ups and Downs of Trading Stocks
does better than the market averages. Regardless of whether traders invest 
through mutual funds or stocks, they hope the portfolio of securities they 
select gives them superior returns — and they’re willing to work at it.
People who decide to trade make a conscious decision to take a more active 
role in increasing their profit potential. Rather than just riding the market up 
and down, they search for opportunities to find the best times and places to 
be in the market based on economic conditions and market cycles.
 
Traders who successfully watched the technical signals before the stock crash 
of 2000 either shorted stocks or moved into cash positions before stocks 
tumbled and then carefully jumped back in as they saw opportunities for 
profits. Some position traders simply stayed on the sidelines, waiting for the 
right time to jump back in. Even though they were waiting, they also carefully 
researched their opportunities, selected stocks for their watch lists, and then 
let technical signals from the charts they kept tell them when to get in or out 
of a position.
Successful Trading Characteristics
To succeed at trading, you have to be hard on yourself and, more than likely, 
work against your natural tendencies, fighting the urge to prove yourself 
right and accepting the fact that you’re going to make mistakes. As a trader, 
you must develop separate strategies for when you want to make a trade 
to enter a position and for when you want to make a trade and exit that 
position, all the while not allowing emotional considerations to affect the 
decisions you make on the basis of the successful trading strategy you’ve 
designed.
 
You want to manage your money, but in doing so you don’t have to prove 
whether your particular buying or selling decision was right or wrong. Setting 
up stop-loss points for every position you establish and adhering to them is 
the right course of action, even though you may later have to admit that you 
were wrong. Your portfolio will survive, and you can always reenter a position 
whenever trends indicate the time is right again.
You need to make stock trends your master, ignoring any emotional ties 
that you have to any stocks. Although you may indeed miss the lowest entry 
price or the highest exit price, you nevertheless will be able to sleep at night, 
knowing that your money is safe and your trading business is alive and well.
 
Traders find out how to ride a trend and when to get off the train before it 
jumps the tracks and heads toward monetary disaster. Enjoy the ride, but 
know which stop you’re getting off at so you don’t turn profits into losses.

12
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Tools of the Trade
The first step you need to take in becoming a trader is gathering all the right 
tools so you can open and operate your business successfully. Your com-
puter needs to meet the hardware requirements and other computer specif-
ics we describe in Chapter 4, including processor speed, memory storage, 
and screen size. You may even want more than one screen, depending on 
your trading style. High-speed Internet access is a must; without it, you may 
as well never open up shop.
We also introduce you to the various types of software in Chapter 4, showing 
you what can help your trading business ride the wave to success. We evalu-
ate traders’ charting favourites, such as MetaStock and TradeStation, along 
with Internet-based charting and data-feed services. We also talk about the 
various trading platforms that are available and how to work with investment 
dealers and online brokers.
After you have all the hardware and software in place, you need to hone your 
analytical skills. Many traders advocate using only technical analysis, but we 
show you how using both technical and fundamental analyses can help you 
excel as a trader.
Taking Time to Trade More 
Than Just Stocks
The ways traders trade are varied. Some are position traders, while others 
are swing traders and day traders. Although many of the tools they use are 
the same or similar, each variety of trader works within differing time frames 
to reach goals specific to the type of trades they’re making.
Position trading
Position traders use technical analysis to find the most promising stock trends 
and enter and exit positions in the market based on those trends. They can 
hold positions for just a few days, a few months, or possibly as long as a year 
or more. Position trading is the type of trading that we discuss the most in 
this book. After introducing you to the stock markets, the types of advisers 
and brokers and market makers with whom you’ll be dealing, and the tools 
you need, we discuss the basics of fundamental analysis and technical analy-
sis to help you become a better position trader.

13
 Chapter 1: The Ups and Downs of Trading Stocks
Short-term swing trading
Swing traders work within much shorter time frames than position traders, 
rarely holding stocks for more than a few days and looking for sharp moves 
that technical analysis uncovers. Even though we don’t show you the specif-
ics of how to become a swing trader, we nevertheless discuss the basics of 
swing trading and its strategies in Chapter 16. You can also read about the 
basics of technical analysis and money management strategies, both of which 
are useful topics to check out if you plan to become a swing trader. However, 
you definitely need to seek additional training before deciding to pursue 
this style of trading — reading Swing Trading For Dummies by Omar Bassal 
(Wiley) would be a good start.
Day trading
Day traders never leave their money in stocks overnight. They always cash 
out. They can trade into and out of a stock position in a matter of hours, 
minutes, or even seconds. Many outsiders watch day traders in action and 
Weathering a bear market
Housing stocks crumbled in the housing crunch. 
Financials were crushed in the credit crisis. We 
can’t claim any special foresight or knowledge 
to know when a stock is about to take a big 
plunge or a company in the United States is 
going to be taken over by the American govern-
ment. We don’t have a crystal ball.
But we are able to keep most of our money safe 
from the ravages of a down market. By using 
strategies that we discuss throughout this book, 
we can exit positions before giving back most of 
our accumulated profits — while many others 
unfortunately do just that.
An impending pullback is not illuminated with 
flashing beacons. No instant indicator tells that 
it’s time to sell everything. Instead, we close 
individual positions as each stock’s technical 
conditions deteriorate. The tools we describe 
in this book enable us to recognize when risk 
levels have changed, when few stocks are 
attractive, and when simply leaving most of 
our trading capital in cash is the best course 
of action.
We have no idea how long the current credit 
crunch will affect the market. In fact, it’s already 
gone on longer and been much more brutal than 
we had guessed. Nevertheless, adhering to the 
techniques featured in this book has kept us 
from committing the bulk of our trading capital 
to failing stocks. We will weather this market 
with the majority of our trading capital intact 
and even make a little money by shorting a few 
stocks or buying some short or double-short 
exchange-traded funds. Thanks to the tools we 
show you in this book, we will be ready to trade 
aggressively when the technical condition of 
stocks begins improving.

14
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
describe it as more like playing a video game than trading stocks. We discuss 
this high-risk type of trading in Chapter 17, but we won’t be showing you the 
specifics of how to do it. If day trading is your goal, this book will take you 
only part of the way there. You’ll discover the basics of technical analysis, 
but you need to seek out additional training before engaging in this risky 
trading style — check out Day Trading For Dummies by Ann C. Logue (Wiley).
Going Long or Short
Before you start trading, you absolutely have to know what stocks you want 
to buy and hold for a while — called going long, or holding a long stock posi-
tion. You likewise have to know at what point holding that stock is no longer 
worthwhile. Similarly, you need to know at what price you want to enter or 
trade into a position and at what price you want to exit or trade out of a posi-
tion. You may be surprised to find out that you can even profit by selling a 
stock without ever owning it, in a process called shorting. We discuss these 
vital trading strategies in Chapter 13.
You can even make money buying and selling options on stocks to simu-
late long or short stock positions. Buying an option known as a call enables 
you to simulate a long stock position, in much the same way that buying an 
option known as a put enables you to simulate a short stock position. You 
make money on a call when the option-related stock rises in price, and you 
make money on a put when the option-related stock falls in price.
When placing orders for puts and calls you’re never guaranteed to make 
money, even when you’re right about the direction a stock will take. The 
values of options are affected by how volatile stock prices are in relationship 
to the overall direction (up or down) in which they’re headed. We discuss 
options and how they work in greater detail in Chapter 18.
Managing Your Money
Managing your trades so that you don’t lose a bunch of money is critical. 
Although we can’t guarantee that you’ll never lose money, we can provide 
you with useful strategies for minimizing your losses and getting out before 
your stock portfolio takes a huge hit. The key is knowing when to hold ’em 
and when to fold ’em, and we cover that in great detail in Chapter 12.
 
One thing we can’t emphasize enough is that you must think of your trading as 
a business and the stocks you hold as its inventory. You can’t allow yourself 
to fall in love and thereby hang on to a stock out of loyalty. You’ll find it espe-
cially hard to admit you’ve made a mistake; nevertheless, you have to bite the 

15
 Chapter 1: The Ups and Downs of Trading Stocks
bullet and exit the position before you take a huge hit. You’ll discover that 
housecleaning and developing successful strategies for keeping your inven-
tory current are important parts of managing a trading portfolio.
Setting a target price for exiting a position before ever trading into it is the 
best way to protect your business from major losses. Stick with those prede-
termined exit prices and you’ll avoid a major pitfall that many traders face — 
holding a position too long and losing everything. You obviously don’t want 
to turn a profit into a loss, so as your position in a stock produces a profit, 
you can periodically raise your target exit price while continuing to hold the 
position to ensure you keep most of that profit.
Understanding your risks — market risks, investment risks, and trading risks — 
helps you to make better trading decisions. We review the different kinds of risks 
as they relate to specific situations at several points throughout the book.
Understanding Fundamental Analysis
You’ve probably heard the phrase, “It’s the economy, stupid.” Well that’s 
true, and we show you how understanding the basics of the business cycle 
can help you improve your trading successes. In Chapter 5, you find out how 
to identify periods of economic growth and recession and how these differing 
periods impact bull and bear stock markets. We also explore sector rotation 
and how to use it to pick the right sectors for your trading activities.
You can also discover plenty of information about how money supply, infla-
tion rates, deflation, unemployment, and consumer confidence impact the 
mood of the market and stock prices and how the economy can be driven by 
how confidently (or not) political and monetary leaders speak out about it. 
We discuss the roles of the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the American Federal 
Reserve (Fed) and how when the Governor of the BoC or the Chairman of the 
Fed speaks, the markets listen.
Understanding how the economy works isn’t the only fundamental analysis 
tool that’s important to you. You also need to read financial statements to 
understand the financial status of the companies you want to buy. We delve 
into financial statements in Chapter 6.
A company’s income statements, on the other hand, give you a look at the 
results for the most recent period and provide a basis for comparison with prior 
years and periods. You can use these statements to look at whether revenues 
are growing, and if they are, by what percentage. You also can see how much 
profit the company is keeping from the revenue it generates. The cash flow state-
ment shows you how efficiently a company is using its cash and whether it’s 
having problems meeting its current obligations. The balance sheet gives you a 
snapshot of a company’s assets and liabilities and shareholders’ equity.

16
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
You can use this information to develop your own estimate of a company’s 
growth and profit potential. In Chapter 6, we show you how to do a few 
basic ratio calculations that you can use to compare similar stocks and then 
choose the one with the best potential.
 
Analysts use this information to project a company’s financial growth and 
profits. Never depend entirely on what analysts say, but do your own research 
and collect the opinions of numerous analysts. One of the best ways to find 
out what analysts are saying and what aspects of the financial statements may 
raise a red flag is by looking at the analyst call. In Chapter 7, we explain how 
you can listen in on some of these calls and understand the unique language 
used in them to make better choices when selecting stocks. We also discuss 
the pros and cons of using analyst reports.
Getting a Grip on Technical Analysis
You use fundamental analysis to determine what part of the business cycle 
the economy is in and what industries offer the best growth potential. Then 
you use that information to select the best target companies and identify 
prices at which you’d want to buy their stocks.
After choosing your targets, you then use technical analysis to follow trends 
in the prices of the target stocks, so you can find the right time to get in and 
ultimately to get out of a stock position. These targets become part of your 
stock-watch list. After you’ve established that list, you then use the tools of 
technical analysis to make your trades.
In Chapter 8, we introduce you to the basics of technical analysis, how it 
works, and how it needs to be used. Although some people think of technical 
analysis as no more than fortune-telling, others believe it yields significant 
information that can help you make successful trades. We obviously believe 
that technical analysis provides you with extensive tools for your trading 
success, and we show you how to use those tools to be profitable.
Your first step in technical analysis is finding out how to create a chart. We 
focus on the most popular type — bar charting. In Chapter 9, you discover 
the art of deciphering simple visual stock patterns and how to distinguish 
between trends and trading ranges, all so you’re able to spot when a stock 
moves from a trading range into either an upward or downward trend and 
know when you need to act.
In Chapter 10, we show you how to use your newfound skill of identifying 
trends to locate areas of support and resistance within a trend that ulti-
mately help you find the right times to make your move. You find out how 
to read the patterns in the charts to identify trading signals and what to do 
when you’ve acted on a failed trading signal.

17
 Chapter 1: The Ups and Downs of Trading Stocks
Chapter 11 fills you in on moving averages and how to use them to identify 
trends. You also find out about oscillators and other indicators that traders 
use for recognizing trading signals. As a rookie trader, you’ll probably find 
that your greatest risk is paralysis by analysis — you may find you’re having 
so much fun reading the charts or are just so confused about which chart has 
the right signal that you feel paralyzed by the variety of choices. We show 
you how to create and use a tiny subset of tools available in today’s chart-
ing software packages to simplify your life and make your choices easier. 
You’ll likewise discover how to use such odd-sounding but critical tools as an 
MACD indicator or a stochastic oscillator, and we help you take advantage of 
the powerful concept of relative strength.
Putting Trading Strategy into Practice
After you get used to using the tools, it’s time to put your new skills into 
practice making money. In Chapter 13, we show you how to put together 
your newfound affinities for fundamental analysis and technical analysis to 
develop and build your trading strategy. Using fundamental analysis, you can
 
✓ Determine which part of the economic cycle is driving the market.
 
✓ Determine which sector makes the most sense for stock trading.
 
✓ Figure out which sectors are in the best positions to go up.
 
✓ Find out which stocks are leading in the ascending sectors.
 
✓ Evaluate where the BoC and the Fed stand on the economy and which of 
their potential moves can impact the strength of the market.
 
✓ Evaluate and hopefully anticipate potential shocks to the market. 
Although doing so may seem like gazing into a crystal ball, you really 
can pick up some signs by checking out the key economic indicators. We 
show you what they are.
After you complete your fundamental analysis, we show you how to use your 
new technical analysis skills successfully to
 
✓ Trade within the overall technical conditions.
 
✓ Confirm which economic cycle a market is in by using index charts.
 
✓ Determine whether an ascending sector is stuck in a range or ready to 
enter a new upward trend.
 
✓ Determine whether leading stocks are stuck in ranges or ready to break 
out in upward trends.

18
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Finally, we show you how to use your newfound skills to manage risk, set up 
a stop-loss position, and choose your time frame for trading.
After honing your skills, you’re ready to start trading. So in Chapter 14 we 
focus on the actual mechanics of trading by
 
✓ Discussing how to enter or trade into a position
 
✓ Explaining bid and ask prices
 
✓ Discussing the risks of market orders
 
✓ Explaining how to use limit and stop orders
We also explore how to exit or trade out of a position and still stay unat-
tached emotionally, when to take your profits, and how to minimize your 
losses, in addition to discussing potential tax hits and how to minimize them.
Now that you know how to research the fundamentals, effectively use the 
technical tools, and mechanically carry out a trade, the next step is develop-
ing and managing your own trading system. We explore the basic steps to 
developing the system, which include
 
1. Designing and keeping a trading log.
 
2. Identifying reliable trading patterns.
 
3. Developing an exit strategy.
 
4. Determining whether you’ll use discretionary trading methods or 
mechanical trading. We explore the pros and cons of each.
 
5. Deciding whether to develop your own trading system or buy one of the 
ones available off the shelf.
 
6. Testing your trading systems and understanding their limitations before 
making a major financial commitment to your new system.
We also discuss assessing your results and fixing any problems.
After you’ve designed, built, and tested your system, you’re ready to jump in 
with both feet. The key to getting started: Make sure you begin with a small sum 
of money, examining your system and then increasing your trading activity as 
you gain experience and develop confidence with the system that you develop.

19
 Chapter 1: The Ups and Downs of Trading Stocks
Trading at Higher Risk
Some traders decide they want to take on a greater level of risk by practis-
ing methods of swing trading or day trading or by delving into the areas of 
trading derivatives or foreign currency. Although all of these alternatives are 
valid trading options, we steer clear of explaining even the basics of how to 
use these high-risk trading alternatives; instead, we provide you with a gen-
eral understanding of the ways these trading alternatives work and the risks 
that are unique to each of them.
If you decide, however, that you want to take on these additional risks, don’t 
depend on the information in this book to get started. Use the general infor-
mation we offer here to determine what additional training you need to feel 
confident before moving into these trading arenas.
Remember: Have Fun!
Although you are without question considering the work of a trader for the 
money you can make, you need to enjoy the game of trading. If you find 
you’re having trouble sleeping at night because of the risks you’re taking, 
then trading may not be worth all the heartache. You may need to put off 
your decision to enter the world of trading until you’re more comfortable 
with the risks or until you’ve designed a system that better accommodates 
your risk tolerance.
You may find that you need to take a slower approach by putting less money 
into your trades. You don’t need to make huge profits with your early trades. 
Just trading into and out of a position without losing any money may be a good 
goal for you when you’re just starting out. If you notice your position turning 
toward the losing side, knowing you can trade your way out of it before you 
take a big loss may help you build greater confidence in your abilities.
Remember, making a losing trade doesn’t mean that you’re a loser. Even the 
most experienced traders must at times face losses. The key to successful trad-
ing is knowing when to get out before your portfolio takes a serious hit. On the 
other side of that coin, you also need to know how to get out when you’re in a 
winning or profitable position. When you’re trying to ride a trend all the way to 
the top, it sometimes starts bottoming out so fast that you lose some or possi-
bly even all of your profits, causing you to end up in a losing position.
Trading is a skill that takes a long time to develop and is perfected only after 
you make mistakes and celebrate successes. Enjoy the rollercoaster ride!

Chapter 2
Exploring the Markets and 
the Stock Exchanges
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the markets
▶ Understanding the exchanges
▶ Reviewing order basics
B
illions of shares trade in Canada and the United States every day, and 
each trader is looking to get his or her small piece of that action. Before 
moving into the specifics of how to trade, we first want to introduce you not 
only to the world of stock trading, but also to trading in other key markets — 
futures, options, and bonds. In this chapter, we also explain differences and 
similarities among key stock exchanges and how those factors impact your 
trading options. After providing you with a good overview of the markets, we 
delve into the different types of orders you can place with each of the key 
exchanges.
Introducing the Broad Markets
You may think the foundation of the Canadian economy resides at the Royal 
Canadian Mint in Winnipeg, where the country manufactures billions of loo-
nies and toonies, or that the foundation of the United States economy resides 
inside Fort Knox where the country holds its billions of dollars in gold. Nope. 
The continent’s true economic centres are Bay Street and Wall Street, where 
billions of dollars change hands each and every day, thousands of companies 
are traded, and millions of people’s lives are affected.
Stocks are not the only things sold in the broad financial markets. Every 
day, futures, options, and bonds also are traded. Although we focus on 
stock exchanges in this chapter, we first need to briefly explain each type of 
market.

22
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Stock markets
The stocks of almost every major Canadian and U.S. corporation and many 
major foreign corporations are traded on stock exchanges in Canada and the 
United States each day, and none of the money involved in these trades goes 
directly into the companies being traded. Today numerous local and interna-
tional stock exchanges trade stocks in publicly held corporations; moreover, 
the only major corporations not traded are those held privately — usually 
by families or original founding partners that choose not to sell shares on 
the public market. Canada’s top private companies include Jimmy Pattison 
Industries, A&W Food Services, and Custom House Global Foreign Exchange. 
Forbes magazine’s top privately held American corporations are Cargill, Koch 
Industries, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Mars. Many of the large private 
corporations that are not traded publicly do have provisions for employee 
ownership of stock and must report earnings to the American SEC, so they 
straddle the line of public versus private corporations.
A share is actually a portion of ownership in a given company. Few sharehold-
ers own large enough stakes in a company to play a major decision-making 
role. Instead, shareholders purchase stocks, hoping that their investments rise 
in price, so that those stocks can be sold at a profit some time in the future.
For the majority of this chapter, we focus on the four top stock exchanges in 
North America:
 
✓ The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX),
 
✓ The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),
 
✓ Nasdaq (the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated 
Quotation system), and
 
✓ The American Stock Exchange (Amex).
We also introduce you to the evolving world of electronic communication net-
works (ECNs) on which you can trade stocks directly, thus bypassing brokers.
Futures markets
Futures trading actually started in Japan in the 18th century to trade rice and 
silk. This trading instrument was first used in North America in the 1850s for 
trading grains and other agricultural entities. Basically, futures trading means 
establishing a financial contract in which you try to predict the future value 
of a commodity that must be delivered at a specific time in the future. (Yup, 
a working crystal ball would be very useful here.) This type of trading is done 
on a commodities exchange. The largest such exchange in North America 
today is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Commodities include any product 

23
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Markets and the Stock Exchanges
that can be bought and sold. Oil, cotton, and minerals are just a few of the 
products sold on a commodities exchange.
 
Futures contracts must have a seller (usually the person producing the 
commodity — a farmer or oil refinery, for example) and a buyer (usually a 
company that actually uses the commodity). You also can speculate on either 
side of the contract, basically meaning:
 
✓ When you buy a futures contract, you’re agreeing to buy a commodity 
that is not yet ready for sale or hasn’t yet been produced at a set price 
at a specific time in the future.
 
✓ When you sell a futures contract, you’re agreeing to provide a commod-
ity that is not yet ready for sale or hasn’t yet been produced at a set 
price at a specific time in the future.
The futures contract states the price at which you agree to pay for or sell a 
certain amount of this future product when it’s delivered at a specific future 
date. Although most futures contracts are based on a physical commodity, 
the highest-volume futures contracts are based on the future value of stock 
indexes and other financially related futures.
Unless you’re a commercial consumer who plans to use the commodity, you 
won’t actually take delivery of or provide the commodity for which you’re 
trading a futures contract. You’ll more than likely sell the futures contract 
you bought before you actually have to accept the commodity from a com-
mercial customer. Futures contracts are used as financial instruments by 
producers, consumers, and speculators. We cover those players and futures 
contracts in much greater depth in Chapter 18.
Bond markets
Bonds are actually loan instruments. Companies sell bonds to borrow cash. If 
you buy a bond, you’re essentially holding a company’s debt or the debt of a 
government entity. The company or government that issues the bond agrees to 
pay you a certain amount of interest for a specific period of time in exchange 
for the use of your money. The big difference between stocks and bonds is that 
bonds are debt obligations and stocks are equity. Shareholders actually own 
a share of the corporation. Bondholders lend money to the company with no 
right of ownership. Bonds, however, are considered safer, because if a com-
pany files bankruptcy, bondholders are paid before shareholders. Bonds are 
a safety net and not actually a part of the trading world for individual position 
traders, swing traders, and day traders. While a greater dollar volume of bonds 
is traded each day, the primary traders for this venue are large institutional 
traders. Many individuals will use short-term bonds and treasury bills as a safe 
place to park their cash while waiting to enter a trading position. We want to 
mention them here but don’t discuss them further in this book.

24
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Options markets
An option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, 
either to buy or to sell the underlying asset upon which the option is based 
at a specified price on or before a specified date. Sometime before the option 
period expires, a purchaser of an option must decide whether to exercise 
the option and buy (or sell) the asset (most commonly stocks) at the target 
price. Options also are called derivatives. We talk more about this investment 
alternative in Chapter 18.
Reviewing Stock Exchanges
Most of this book covers stock trading, so we obviously concentrate on how 
the key exchanges — TSX, NYSE, Nasdaq, and Amex — operate and how 
these operations impact your trading activity.
Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and 
other Canadian exchanges
Most securities in Canada trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), which 
was established in 1852. The TSX is owned by the TMX Group, which also 
operates the TSX Venture Exchange for small new companies as well as the 
Montreal Exchange for derivatives trading. Fixed-income bonds, natural gas, 
crude oil, and electricity contracts also trade through the TMX Group. TSX is 
the eighth largest in the world by market capitalization.
A handful of electronic exchanges have taken some blue-chip stock trad-
ing business from the TSX because of improved technology and lower fees. 
Rivals include Alpha and Chi-X Canada, which operate as alternate trading 
systems (ATS). Pure trading is another ATS that is connected to the Canadian 
National Stock Exchange (CNSX), where shares of emerging companies are 
traded.
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
The U.S. stock market dates back to May 17, 1792, when 24 brokers signed an 
agreement under a buttonwood tree at what today is 58 Wall Street. The 24 
brokers specifically agreed to sell shares of companies among themselves, 
charging a commission or fee to buy and sell shares for others who wanted to 
invest in a company. Yup, the first American stockbrokers were born that day.

25
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Markets and the Stock Exchanges
A formalized exchange didn’t come into existence until March 8, 1817, when 
the brokers adopted a formal constitution and named their new entity the 
New York Stock & Exchange Board. Brokers actually worked outdoors until 
1860, when operations finally were moved inside. The first stock ticker was 
introduced in 1867, but it wasn’t until 1869 that the NYSE started requiring 
the registration of securities for companies that wanted to have their stock 
traded on the exchange. Registration began as a means of preventing the 
over-issuance (selling too many shares) of a company’s stock.
From these meagre beginnings, the NYSE built itself into the largest stock 
exchange in the world with many of the largest companies listed on the 
exchange. Trading occurs on the floor of the exchange, with specialists 
and floor traders running the show. Today these specialists and floor trad-
ers work electronically, which first became possible when the exchange 
introduced electronic capabilities for trading in 2004. For traders, the new 
electronic trading capabilities are a more popular tool than working with 
specialists and floor traders. Electronic trading capabilities were enhanced 
when the NYSE merged with Archipelago Holdings in 2006. The exchange 
expanded its global trading capabilities after a merger with Euronext in 2007, 
which made trading in European stocks much easier. Some European compa-
nies, such as German insurer Allianz, have delisted from the NYSE due to the 
American regulatory burden of Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. The federal law of 
2002 seeks to promote corporate accountability.
 
You may not realize just how much the concept of supply and demand influ-
ences the trading price of a stock. Price swings of a stock frequently are 
caused by shifts in the supply of shares available for sale and the demand cre-
ated by the number of buyers wanting to purchase available shares.
The specialist
Specialists — whose title soon may change to designated market makers — 
buffer dramatic swings when news about a company breaks. If news that 
has a major impact on a stock’s price breaks, specialists buy shares or 
sell the ones they hold in a company to make the trend toward a higher or 
lower stock price more orderly. For example, if good news breaks, creating 
more demand for the stock and overwhelming existing supply, the special-
ist becomes a seller of the stock to minimize the impact of a major price 
increase by increasing supply. The same is true when bad news strikes, cre-
ating a situation in which having more sellers than buyers drives the stock 
price down. In that situation, the specialist becomes a buyer of the stock, 
easing the impact of the drop in price.
The floor trader
The guys you see on the floor of the stock exchange, waving their hands 
wildly to make trades, are the floor traders. They’re actually members of the 
NYSE who trade exclusively for their own accounts. Floor traders also can act 
as a floor broker for others and sell their services.

26
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
The specialist’s book
You may wonder how a specialist keeps track of all this information. That 
one’s easy: The specialist records all trades and quotation changes in the 
specialist’s order book. Any questions that arise about trading activities can 
be researched using this book.
Open outcry
The NYSE still uses what’s becoming an outdated method of trading called 
open outcry, in which stocks are sold like a public auction with verbal bids 
and offers shouted at the trading post. These trading posts are centred on 
the specialist’s location for particular stocks. Other exchanges exclusively 
use computer-based network systems for trading.
The NYSE is the last big stock exchange to use open outcry, but even here it’s 
taking a backseat to automated execution. Only a tiny fraction of trades are 
handled through open outcry. Except for a small group of very high-priced 
stocks, almost everything is handled immediately by electronic execution.
NYSE Hybrid Market
The New York Stock Exchange uses the Hybrid Market program to integrate 
the best aspects of the open outcry or auction market with electronic trad-
ing. Most NYSE trades are now handled electronically, but brokers can still 
choose to route customer orders to the floor for open-outcry trading.
Nasdaq
Nasdaq, which used to stand for National Association of Securities Dealers 
Automated Quotations but now is just like any other proper name, is the 
fastest-growing stock market today. The market was formed after an SEC 
study in the early 1960s concluded that the sale of over-the-counter (OTC) 
securities — in other words, securities that aren’t traded on the existing 
stock exchanges — was fragmented and obscure. The report called for the 
automation of the OTC market and gave the responsibility for implementing 
that system to the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD).
The NASD began construction of the Nasdaq system in 1968, and its first 
trades were made beginning February 8, 1971, when Nasdaq became the 
world’s first electronic stock market. Nasdaq continues to be the world 
leader in volume trading per hour.
Market makers
Unlike the specialist structure of the NYSE, in which one specialist represents 
a particular stock, Nasdaq market makers compete with each other to buy 
and sell the stocks they choose to represent. More than 500 member firms 

27
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Markets and the Stock Exchanges
act as market makers for Nasdaq. All market makers are members of the 
NASD. Each uses its own capital, research, and system resources to repre-
sent a stock and compete with other market makers.
Market makers compete for customers’ orders by displaying buy and sell 
quotations on an electronic exchange for a guaranteed number of shares at 
a specific price. After market makers receive orders, they immediately pur-
chase or sell stock from their own inventories or seek out the other side of 
the trades so they can be executed, usually in a matter of seconds. The four 
types of market makers are
 
✓ Retail market makers: Serve institutional and individual investors 
through brokerage networks that provide a continuous flow of orders 
and sales opportunities.
 
✓ Wholesale market makers: Serve primarily institutional clients and 
other brokers or dealers who aren’t registered market makers in a par-
ticular company’s stock but who need to execute orders for their 
customers.
 
✓ Institutional market makers: Execute large block orders for institutional 
investors, such as pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, 
and asset management companies.
 
✓ Regional market makers: Serve companies and individuals of a par-
ticular region. By focusing regionally, these market makers offer their 
customers more extensive coverage of the stocks and investors in a par-
ticular area of the country.
Nasdaq continues to be the leader in electronic trading. Its system, called the 
Nasdaq Crossing Network, enables fully anonymous trade execution to mini-
mize the market impact of trading.
Over-the-counter and bulletin-board stocks
Stocks that do not meet the minimum requirements to be listed on Nasdaq 
are traded as over-the-counter or bulletin-board stocks (OTCBB). The OTCBB is 
a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, 
and volume information for the stocks traded OTCBB. These stocks generally 
don’t meet the listing qualifications for Nasdaq or other national securities 
exchanges, and fewer than two (and sometimes zero) market makers trade in 
these stocks, making buying and selling them more difficult.
 
Over-the-counter stocks are also traded on what is quaintly called the Pink 
Sheets — harkening back to a time when stock quotes were printed on pink 
coloured paper. Effectively little or no regulatory power exists over compa-
nies whose shares trade on the OTCBB or the Pink Sheets. Sadly, this is where 
many fraudulent penny stocks and their promoters have migrated from what 
used to be the Vancouver Stock Exchange, complete with its “penny dread-
fuls.” Five words of advice: Buyers beware; sellers be quick.

28
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Amex
When the NYSE moved indoors, some stocks still weren’t good enough to be 
sold on the exchange. Those stocks were called curb traders and ultimately 
made up what became known as the American Stock Exchange (Amex), 
which moved indoors in 1921. Amex lists stocks that are smaller in size than 
those on the NYSE yet still have a national following. Many firms that first list 
on Amex work to meet the listing requirements of the NYSE and then switch 
over.
The Amex trading system was integrated into the NYSE trading system after 
the merger with the NYSE was completed in 2008. It is now called the NYSE 
Alternext US, and trades small-company stocks.
Electronic communications 
networks (ECNs)
Many traders look for ways to get around dealing with a traditional broker. 
Instead they access trades using a direct-access broker. We talk more about 
the differences in Chapter 3. A new system of electronic trading that is devel-
oping is called the electronic communications network (ECN).
ECNs enable buyers and sellers to meet electronically to execute trades. 
The trades are entered into the ECN systems by market makers at one of the 
exchanges or by an OTC market maker. Transactions are completed without 
a broker-dealer, saving users the cost of commissions normally charged for 
more traditional forms of trading.
Subscribers to ECNs include retail investors, institutional investors, market 
makers, and broker-dealers. ECNs are accessed through a custom terminal or 
by direct Internet connection. Orders are posted by the ECN for subscribers 
Listing requirements
Nasdaq has the easiest minimum listing require-
ments of all the broad-market exchanges, fol-
lowed by the NYSE Alternext US (formerly Amex). 
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has the 
toughest requirements to meet for companies 
to be listed. In addition to listing requirements, 
companies on the exchanges must conform 
to certain rules, including publishing quarterly 
reports, soliciting proxies, and publicly announc-
ing developments that may affect the value of the 
securities.

29
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Markets and the Stock Exchanges
to view. The ECN then matches orders for execution. In most cases, buyers 
and sellers maintain their anonymity and do not list identifiable information 
in their buy or sell orders.
In the last few years ECNs have gone through consolidation, and only two 
independent ECNs are left. The two independent ECNs, Nomura’s Instinet 
and Bloomberg Tradebook, primarily service the institutional marketplace. 
Archipelago now operates under the HYSE umbrella as HYSE Arca Options.
Understanding Order Types
Buying a stock can be as easy as calling a broker and saying you want to buy 
such and such a stock — but you can place an order in a number of other 
ways that give you better protections. Most orders are placed as day orders, 
but you can choose to place them as good ’til cancelled orders. The four 
basic types of orders you can place are market orders, limit orders, stop 
orders, and stop-limit orders.
Understanding the language and using it to protect your assets and the way 
you trade are critical to your success as a trader. The next few sections 
explain the nuances of placing orders so you don’t make a potentially costly 
mistake by placing a market order when you intended to place a limit order. 
Putting a stop-limit order in place may sound like the safest way to go; how-
ever, doing so may not help you in a rapidly changing market.
Market order
When you place a market order, you’re essentially telling advisers to buy 
or sell a stock at the current market price. A market order is the way your 
adviser normally places an order unless you give him or her different instruc-
tions. The advantage of a market order is that you’re almost always guaran-
teed that your order is executed as long as willing buyers and sellers are in 
the marketplace. Generally speaking, buy orders are filled at the ask price 
and sell orders are filled at the bid price. If, however, you’re working with a 
dealer who has a smart-order routing system, which looks for the best bid/
ask prices, you sometimes can get a better price on the Nasdaq or NYSE 
Alternext US exchanges. In most investment dealers, market orders are the 
cheapest to place with the lowest commission level.
 
The disadvantage of a market order is that you’re stuck paying the price when 
the order is executed — possibly not at the price you expected when you 
placed the order. Investment dealers and real-time quote services quote you 
prices, but because the markets move fast, with deals taking place in seconds, 
you’ll probably find that the price you’re quoted rarely is the same as the 

30
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
execution price. Whenever you place a market order, especially if you’re seek-
ing a large number of shares, the probability is even greater that you’ll receive 
different prices for parts of the order — 100 shares at $25 and 100 shares at 
$25.05, for example.
Limit order
If you want to avoid buying or selling stock at a price higher or lower than 
you intend, you must place a limit order instead of a market order. When plac-
ing a limit order, you specify the price at which you’ll buy or sell. You can 
place either a buy limit order or a sell limit order. Buy limit orders can be 
executed only when a seller is willing to sell the stock you’re buying at the 
limit price or lower. A sell limit order can be executed only when a buyer is 
willing to pay your limit price or higher. In other words, you set the param-
eters for the price you’ll accept. You can’t do that with a market order.
The risk you take when placing a limit order is that the order may never be 
filled. For example, a hot stock piques your interest when it’s selling for $10, 
so you decide to place a limit order to buy the stock at $10.50. By the time 
you call your broker or input the order into your trading system, the price 
already has moved above $10.50 and never drops back to that level; thus, 
your order won’t be filled. On the good side, if the stock is so hot that its 
price skyrockets to $75, you also won’t be stuck as the owner of the stock 
after purchasing near the $75 high. That high will likely be a temporary top 
that quickly drops back to reality, forcing you to sell the stock at a significant 
loss at some point in the future.
 
Most firms charge more for executing a limit order than they do for a market 
order. Be sure you understand the fee and commission structures if you 
intend to use limit orders.
Stop order
You may also consider placing your order as a stop order, which means 
that whenever the stock reaches a price that you specify, it automatically 
becomes a market order. Investors who buy using a stop order usually do 
so to limit potential losses or protect a profit. Buy stop orders are always 
entered at a stop price that is above the current market price.
When placing a sell stop order, you do so to avoid further losses or to protect 
a profit that exists in case the stock continues on a downward trend. The stop 
price is always placed below the current market price. For example, when you 
have a stock that you bought for $10 that now is selling for $25, you can decide 
to protect most of that profit by placing a sell stop order that specifies that 
stock be sold when the market price falls to $20, thus cementing a $10 gain.

31
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Markets and the Stock Exchanges
You don’t have to watch the stock market every second; instead, when 
the market price drops to $20, your stop order automatically switches to a 
market order and is executed.
The big disadvantage of a stop order is that if for some reason the stock 
market gets a shock during the news day that affects all stocks, it can tem-
porarily send prices lower, activating your stop price. If it turns out that the 
downturn is actually merely a short-term fluctuation and not an indication 
that the stock you hold is a bad choice or that you risk losing your profit, 
your stock may sell before you ever have time to react.
 
The bottom can fall out of your stock’s pricing. After your stop price is 
reached, a stop order automatically becomes a market order and the price 
that you actually receive can differ greatly from your stop price, especially in a 
rapidly fluctuating market. You can avoid this problem by placing a stop-limit 
order, which we discuss in the next section.
 
Stop orders are not officially supported on Nasdaq. However, most dealers 
offer a service to simulate a stop order. If you want to enter a stop order for 
a Nasdaq stock, your adviser must watch the market and enter the market or 
limit order you designate as a stop when the stock reaches your specified sale 
price. Some investment dealers won’t accept a stop order on some securities 
and almost never accept a stop order for OTC stocks. If you intend to use stop 
orders, make sure that you
 
✓ Check with the dealers you’re planning to use to ensure they accept 
stop orders.
 
✓ Find out what your dealers charge for stop orders.
 
✓ Review how your dealers’ stop orders work, so you don’t run into 
surprises.
After all, you don’t want to execute a stop order and end up selling a stock 
that you didn’t intend to sell or at a price you find unacceptable.
Stop-limit order
You can protect yourself from any buying or selling surprises by placing a 
stop-limit order. This type of order combines the features of both a stop order 
and a limit order. When your stop price is reached, the stop order becomes a 
limit order rather than a market order.
A stop-limit order gives you the most control over the price at which you will 
trade your stock. You can avoid a purchase or sale of your stock at a price 
that differs significantly from what you intend. But you do risk the possibility 
that the stop-limit order may never be executed, which can happen in fast-
moving markets where prices fluctuate wildly.

32
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
For example, you may find that deploying stop-limit orders is particularly 
dangerous to your portfolio, especially when bad news breaks about a stock 
you’re holding and its price drops rapidly. Although you have a stop-limit 
order in place, and the stop price is met, the movement in the market may 
happen so rapidly that the price limit you set can be missed. In this case, the 
limit side of the order actually prevents the sale of the stock and you risk 
riding it all the way down until you change your order. For example, say you 
purchased a stock at $8 near its peak. On the day the company’s CEO and 
CFO were fired, the stock dropped to $4.05. You may have had a stop-limit 
order in place to sell at $5, but on the day of the firing, the price dropped so 
rapidly after the company announced the firing that your stop-limit order 
could not be filled at your limit price.
 
Stop-limit orders, like stop orders, are more commonly used when trading 
on an exchange than in an OTC market. Investment dealers likewise can limit 
the securities on which stop-limit orders can be placed. If you want to use 
stop-limit orders, be sure to review the rules with your broker before trying to 
execute them.
Good ’til cancelled orders
You can avoid having to replace an order time and again by using a good ’til 
cancelled (GTC) order. GTC orders are placed at a limit price and last until 
the order actually is executed or you decide to cancel it. A GTC order won’t 
be executed until the limit price is reached, regardless of how many days or 
weeks it takes.
You can choose to use this type of order whenever you want to set a limit 
price that differs significantly from the current market price. Many brokerage 
firms limit how much time a GTC can remain in place, such as 90 days, and 
most of them charge more for executing this type of order.
Other order types
Less commonly used order methods include contingent, all-or-none, and fill-
or-kill orders. Contingent orders are placed on the contingency that another 
one of your stock holdings is sold before the buy order is placed. An all-or-
none order specifies that all the shares be bought according to the terms 
indicated or none of the stock should be purchased. A fill-or-kill order must be 
filled immediately upon placement or killed.

Your Investment Options

▶ Sorting through different types of investment accounts
▶ Deciphering trading rules
A
s an individual, you can’t trade stocks — or bonds, or options, or 
futures — unless you have an investment adviser or a discount broker. 
That doesn’t mean, however, that you have to work with a human being to 
trade stocks. Online or discount brokers and direct-access brokers enable 
you to make trades electronically, so you never have to speak with a human 
being unless you’re having a technical problem.
The differences are based on prices, services, and special capabilities. High-
volume swing traders and day traders typically require the services of a 
direct-access broker, while position traders can and do trade successfully 
with more traditional discount, online, and full-service investment advisers. 
In this chapter, we help you understand the options that are available, the 
types of accounts you can establish, and the basic trading rules you must 
follow.
Why You Need a Discount Broker 
or Investment Adviser
Unless you plan to get your designation as a Registered Representative 
through your provincial securities commission and set up shop yourself 
(which is hard — and expensive — to do), you need to work with an invest-
ment adviser or a discount broker to be able to buy and sell stocks. How 
you choose is based on the level of individual services you want. The more 

34
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
services you want, the more you pay for your ability to trade. We cover the 
many levels of brokers and investment advisers in greater detail when we 
talk about licensing in Chapter 20.
On one end of the spectrum is the full-service adviser, who does a lot of 
hand-holding and offers stock research and advice and other human-based 
services. When using a full-service adviser, you pay a negotiated commission 
for each stock trade. In the middle are online discount brokers, who offer 
fewer services but charge less per trade. On the opposite end are direct-
access brokers, who offer few human-based services and instead provide 
extensive trading platforms so you can trade electronically and access the 
stock exchange systems directly on a real-time basis.
Exploring Types of Brokers and 
Investment Services
Before you can pick the type of professional that best fulfills your needs, you 
have to understand the kinds of services that each provides. After you have 
acquired an understanding of your options and have selected the types of 
services you want, carefully research each broker or adviser that matches 
your needs. Within each classification are good and bad professionals. We 
give you the tools for researching investment firms in the sections that 
follow.
Just a word or two on the titles we use for the professionals who are there 
to help you in your trading. In the bad ol’ days there were stockbrokers, who 
worked with fixed commissions. Other titles alongside stockbrokers were 
investment executives, account managers, financial planners, money manag-
ers, account executives, and investment advisers. The formal title of those 
licensed through their provincial governments to assist with your trading 
was Registered Representative, although very few stockbrokers ever put that 
name on their business card.
Then the Internet arrived, thank goodness, and commissions virtually disap-
peared thanks to the arrival of online or discount brokers. Throughout the 
For Canadians For Dummies financial books we try to cut through the confu-
sion of all these titles for professionals who help with your trading — we 
use two titles: investment advisers and discount brokers. Of course this is a 
generalization, and of course some overlap exists between the two areas of 
investment practice.

35
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Investment Options
We try to standardize the names for the companies that employ those two 
types of professionals into the two camps of investment dealers and online 
brokers, rather than referring to all of them as brokerage houses.
Full-service investment advisers
If you want someone to assist you with making and implementing buying deci-
sions, check out the full-service advisers. They offer extensive research and 
other services. Usually, they call you with trading ideas — all you need to do 
is say yes or no. You pay a negotiated commission percentage based on dollar 
volume, or you pay a monthly fee so you can trade at will. You can invest in 
treasury bills, exchange-traded funds, stocks, futures, options, bonds, mutual 
funds, money market funds, and variable annuities. You can work with a full-
service adviser by telephone, mail, fax, or Internet. Most have Web sites you 
can access for information, and many allow you to enter your own trades.
All investment advisers offer financial planning advice so that more of your 
trading profits go into your pocket (rather than the tax man’s pocket). 
Investment advisers are happy to undertake a review of your estate planning, 
and can give advice on how to enhance your credit rating. Most investment 
advisers are social creatures who like to meet face to face. Some traders 
enjoy this personal interaction, others are put off. Take your pick.
To illustrate, the following mini table shows the transaction fee schedule for 
one of the better-known full-service investment advisers (others can be as 
much as twice as high):
Transaction Size
Commission Rate
$0–$2,499
$40 plus 1.7% of principal
$2,500–$6,249
$65 plus 0.66% of principal
$6,250–$19,999
$85 plus 0.34% of principal
$20,000–$49,999
$115 plus 0.33% of principal
$50,000–$499,999
$170 plus 0.11% of principal
$500,000+
$270 plus 0.09% of principal
Alternatively, some full-service advisers do permit you to make all the trades 
you want per year for a fee of 0.30 percent to 2.5 percent of the total assets 
in your account. Using language common to traders, that’s 30 to 250 basis 

36
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
points. You have to have more than $1 million in an account to get the lowest 
fee. Traders with less than $100,000 pay closer to the 2.5 percent of assets to 
access the unlimited trading features.
 
Just because you choose to use a full-service adviser doesn’t mean you can 
simply sit back and watch your money grow after placing it into an account. 
Advisers make money on commissions for trading stocks. If they have no trans-
actions during a given month, they don’t get paid. Unscrupulous advisers rec-
ommend trades to their customers to generate new commissions even when 
those decisions are not necessarily the best investment advice for their clients.
The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has led the crusade across the 
country in resolving the conflicts of interest between the work done by 
research analysts and their investment banking partners. See Chapter 7 for 
an explanation of the research disclosures imposed in Canada today.
In the United States, even the research arms of many American full-service 
brokerage houses have come under scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) in the past few years, primarily because their 
analysts didn’t accurately reflect the values of stocks in companies that used 
the firms’ investment-banking capabilities. Analysts tend to see their firms’ 
clients through rose-coloured glasses when providing research reports, espe-
cially when their firms make a lot of money by providing investment-banking 
services to those companies.
 
Just because you choose to work through a full-service adviser doesn’t mean 
you can sidestep doing your own research. You always need to perform due 
diligence, independently researching your stock purchases. Although you cer-
tainly can use the research arm of your investment firm, it shouldn’t be your 
sole source of research on any stock you’re thinking about buying or that you 
already hold.
If you’re planning to be a trader, do your own research and implement your 
own trading strategies. Why pay for the services of a full-service adviser? We 
really don’t recommend that you spend your money on the additional costs 
of maintaining a full-service investment account or paying the high transac-
tion fees and commissions after you have the tools and the confidence to go 
it alone. If you’re lucky enough to find a full-service investment adviser who 
will offer you discounts on your trading commissions, then you have the best 
of both worlds. Well done!
Discount brokers
Many discount brokers offer the same services as full-service investment 
advisers, including research. The big exception is that you won’t get individ-
ual attention or unsolicited advice on what to buy or sell. Some discount bro-
kers send out monthly newsletters with stock recommendations; most don’t 

37
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Investment Options
trade futures or sell variable annuities. You can access a discount broker by 
telephone, mail, fax, or using an Internet connection. To get the lowest fees, 
you need to do your own trades by accessing the broker’s Web site.
The big difference to you, as an individual trader, is that you can save a lot 
of money on trading costs, provided you know what you’re doing and you 
understand the language of stock trading. Transaction fees for online trades 
can range from as low as $5 up to about $30 with a discount broker. If you 
want special services requiring a broker’s assistance, you can work with 
a human being. Depending on the discount broker and the level of service 
required, fees can range from $25 to $50 per trade. Some discount brokers 
provide broker-assisted trades using a commission rate schedule similar to 
the ones offered by full-service advisers, but for lower fees per trade. If you 
get involved in more complicated trading transactions that require human 
assistance, costs can rise significantly. Whenever you’re planning to use a 
broker’s assistance, be sure you understand any additional costs that may be 
charged to your account for that assistance.
Direct-access brokers
If you want to bypass the traditional brokers and trade directly through an 
exchange or market maker, you need to open your account with a direct-
access broker so you can use one or more of the electronic communications 
networks (ECNs) to make your trades. Traders usually download software onto 
their PCs so they can access the ECN directly using their Internet connection.
Traders using direct-access brokers typically get real-time Nasdaq Level I 
quotes, which show the latest bid and ask prices, quote size, the last trade, 
and volume.
Direct-access brokers also offer Nasdaq Level II. Nasdaq fees are higher for 
Level II, and the brokerage may also charge a fee for this type of access. 
In addition to what you see in a Level I quote, you also find the number of 
market makers participating in the market for any one stock.
A Nasdaq Level II quote screen shows the best bid price and the best ask 
price for specific stocks from participating market makers. All the bid and ask 
prices are ranked from best to worst. Some direct-access brokers combine 
Nasdaq Level II information and ECN book data to show the complete market 
depth for a specific stock. The ECN book is not a printed book like you would 
expect to find on a bookstore shelf. It’s a compilation of all the trades and 
the bid and ask quotes available on all the electronic networks. We show you 
some examples of Level I and Level II quote screens in Chapter 14.
Traders can review the quotes and select which market maker or ECN to use 
for each transaction. Most full-service and discount brokers make that choice 

38
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
for you when you’re working with them. A few discount brokers are providing 
access to ECNs.
 
When working with direct-access brokers, one key difference is that the soft-
ware you use may reside on your own computer and not on your broker’s 
server, which greatly accelerates the speed at which you can trade. Again, 
some discount brokers provide software to enable you to receive direct raw 
data on your home computer, but their software is not as sophisticated as 
what direct-access brokers have to offer. We cover software issues in detail in 
Chapter 4.
 
We often talk about how you can miss trading at the prices you want, espe-
cially in fast-moving markets. Well, having direct access doesn’t guarantee 
you won’t miss a price, but your chances of catching those prices are better, 
because you won’t have to wait for pages to download from your broker’s 
server. Of course, to work this advantage you must have high-speed Internet 
access (through DSL, cable, or satellite).
Working with a direct-access broker gives you a steady stream of raw finan-
cial data — the actual trades, current bid and ask prices, trading volume, and 
market statistics. The depth of the bids and offers — that is, what bids are 
behind the highest bid and what offers are behind the lowest offer — is very 
useful information. The trading software you load onto your computer deter-
mines how these data are organized and presented on your computer moni-
tor. Providing better access is how direct-access brokers distinguish their 
services from other brokers.
Software prices and access fees vary greatly and can cost you as much as 
$300 per month. The broker sometimes will waive the fees, especially if 
your trading volume is high enough — typically about 50 or more trades per 
month. As you can see, you have to make regular trades for a direct-access 
broker to be more cost effective than a discount broker. That said, even 
some discount brokers offer limited direct access using less-sophisticated 
software.
Futures brokers
Unless you’re working with a full-service investment firm, you may have to 
open a separate account with a futures trader if you want to trade commodities 
or other types of futures. Many direct-access brokers provide futures trading 
services, but you will not always find them at a discount broker. We talk more 
about licensing in Chapter 20 and about trading futures in Chapter 18.

39
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Investment Options
Services to Consider When Choosing 
Your Broker/Adviser
Don’t even think about choosing your professional purely on the basis of 
price. You need to know what types of services are offered that enable you 
to make the types of trades you want to make. Check out the types of orders 
they support, whether they can offer you a data feed, what types of charts 
they provide, and, if you want to make your own trades electronically, 
whether they can give you ECN access.
Types of orders
As we mention in Chapter 2, not all brokers provide stop orders for OTC and 
Nasdaq trades. The Nasdaq has no facility for handling stop orders, so the 
broker must monitor your stop prices and enter either market or limit orders 
when your price is triggered. Although monitoring stop prices usually is done 
automatically, not all brokers offer the service — if you know you’ll be using 
stops with many of your trades, find a broker who does. Some discount bro-
kers will, provided you’re willing to pay.
As such, you also need to compare not only prices but also the respective 
brokers’ reputations for effectively and efficiently providing those services. 
And if you want to place contingent orders (see Chapter 2), you may discover 
that few discount brokers offer that service, even for a price.
 
Steer clear of brokers who accept payment for order flow, a practice in which 
some exchanges or market makers pay brokerage firms for routing orders to 
them. Firms can make a penny or more per share, but the regulators require 
the firm to inform you whether it receives payment for order flow when you 
first open an account and thereafter on an annual basis. Each time a firm 
receives a payment for order flow, it must disclose that information on the 
trade confirmation. If you see an indication on one of your trades that your 
broker received this type of payment, you have the right to request notifica-
tion in writing about the source and type of payment related to that transac-
tion. These payments may encourage unethical brokers to steer orders away 
from the best prices and toward the market maker offering such payments.

40
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Data feed
The type of data to which you want to have access is crucial. Most brokers pro-
vide basic stock quotes, usually in real time, and some may even offer market 
data providing a much deeper look at the market that includes not only current 
but previous sales information. If you want access to a higher level of data, be 
certain you open your account with a firm that provides the level of data you 
need, or you may buy it from a third party. Again, pricing for differing data 
feeds can vary among firms. Firms that offer ways for you to get the data feed 
through your home computer (as opposed to accessing it from their servers) 
charge more, but keep in mind that you’ll receive the information quicker. The 
faster your Internet connection, the more quickly and reliably you’ll receive 
the information. We cover data feeds in greater detail in Chapter 4.
Charts
Data fed into your home computer are raw stock market data. How this infor-
mation is formatted on your computer and the kind of charts you’re able 
to build from it depends on the software provided by your dealer. Charting 
software can be critical to your ability to make trading decisions. Your dealer 
may charge you to use the software, but will usually discount or waive the fee 
based on the size of your portfolio or your volume of trading activity. Many 
free charting alternatives are also available online, including StockCharts.
com, which we used to produce the charts for this book. We talk about chart-
ing capabilities in Chapter 4.
ECN access
If direct access to stock exchanges and market makers is important to you, 
then you need to find a broker that provides ECN access. You don’t have to 
open an account through a direct-access broker; some discount brokers do 
provide ECN access. Be sure to check out the section on “Choosing the Right 
Broker/Adviser for You,” later in this chapter.
Understanding the Types of 
Investment Accounts
You can open your investment accounts in a couple different ways — as a 
cash account or a margin account. You also may open separate accounts for 
retirement or education savings. Because retirement accounts have more 

41
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Investment Options
restrictions, your trading alternatives are more limited in those accounts, but 
that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. You shouldn’t be risking your retirement or 
education funds on speculative trading anyway.
Cash accounts
The traditional investment account is a cash account. With a cash account, 
you must deposit the full cost of any purchases by the settlement date of the 
transaction. Most dealers require that funds to buy stocks be in your cash 
account before you can place an order. The amount of cash you need to have 
on deposit varies; some let you open an account for as little as $100 or $1,000, 
but others require as much as $10,000 or more to open a new cash account.
Margin accounts
You don’t have to have as much cash on hand to buy stock when you open a 
margin account. This type of account enables you to borrow certain amounts 
of money using cash or securities already in the account as collateral. 
Because using a margin account essentially is buying stocks, bonds, or com-
modities on credit, each respective firm has its own screening procedure to 
determine whether you qualify for the loan and can buy on margin.
A $2,000 minimum deposit usually is required to open a margin account. You 
can borrow on margin to 50 percent of the initial purchase price. Not all stocks 
can be bought on margin. Some firms enforce even stricter margin rules, espe-
cially if you choose to invest in volatile stocks valued at less than $5. When 
buying stocks on margin you pay an interest rate on the margin loans, but 
most firms charge relatively low rates to encourage the transaction business. 
Be sure to check out the “Margin requirements” section later in this chapter.
When opening a margin account, the firm requires you to sign what’s called 
a margin agreement, which stipulates regulations for the account and permits 
the broker to have a lien on your account whenever the balance falls below 
the minimum maintenance margin (more about that in a moment). The agree-
ment also enables your firm to loan your shares to short sellers. That’s where 
shorted stock comes from. We talk more about short selling and the mechan-
ics of margin trading in Chapter 14.
 
You’re taking a risk by purchasing shares with borrowed money and using 
shares you own as collateral. If your stock holdings fall in value below the 
minimum maintenance margin requirement, your dealer can force you to sell 
stock you don’t want to sell and use other assets you may not want to use 
to cover the outstanding loan. The risks and regulations for using a margin 
account are described more fully in the section on margin requirements later 
in this chapter.

42
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Options
If you want to trade options, your dealer will require you to sign a special 
options agreement acknowledging that you understand the risks associated with 
trading options or derivative instruments. This practice became common after 
dealers were sued by some clients because they suffered huge losses when trad-
ing options and claimed they were unaware of the risks. The agreement protects 
the dealer from being sued if you lose a lot of money, so you need to know what 
you’re doing when dealing with derivatives (see Chapter 18).
Although you may be able to find a firm that allows you to trade using 
options — long puts and calls, which are a type of option (see Chapter 18) — 
you need to know exactly what you’re doing and the cost of doing it. Only 
about 25 percent of the 30,000 people approved to work in stock markets in 
Canada are licensed to trade options.
Registered Retirement Savings 
Plans (RRSPs)
RRSP accounts in which you’re saving for retirement do not allow you to trade 
on margin at all. These limitations are for your protection to avoid risking major 
losses in your long-term investments that never should be put at such high levels 
of risk. The amount you can contribute each year to all retirement accounts is 
limited by the Income Tax Act, so you must be careful with this money.
Because these accounts are tax-deferred, you can’t write off any losses in them 
against any gains from investments held outside of them — that is, in other tax-
able accounts. In other words, you don’t have the same tax-planning choices 
with registered retirement accounts to offset gains and losses. All money taken 
out of an RRSP at retirement is taxed at your current income tax rate. This 
differs from stocks held outside an RRSP. For these stocks, you can use stock 
losses to minimize the tax you might have to pay on stock gains. Here are some 
additional trading limitations of registered retirement accounts:
 
✓ Margin is not allowed: Using funds within a retirement account as col-
lateral for trading on margin is not permitted. It’s against the law. You 
won’t find a firm in Canada that will approve margin in a registered 
retirement account.
 
✓ Short positions are prohibited: Speculative trading using short posi-
tions, which is a common trading strategy for futures contracts and 
widely used by experienced stock and bond traders, requires a margin 
account. When someone shorts a stock, he or she borrows the stock and 
sells it in the hope of buying it back later for less. Selling short requires 
the use of margin, and is therefore not permitted in a registered retire-
ment account. We talk more about short selling in Chapter 14.

43
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Investment Options
 
✓ Trading policies are more stringent: All firms have more stringent 
trading policies for registered retirement accounts. Before you open a 
registered retirement account, check with your firm about its trading 
limitations to be sure they match your intentions for the account.
 
✓ Certain options trading may be permitted: If you’re an experienced 
trader, you can find some firms that allow options trading in your reg-
istered retirement account. Not all types of options, however, can be 
traded in a retirement account. The ones that you can trade are short 
covered calls, long calls, and put positions. We talk more about puts and 
calls in Chapter 18.
Registered Retirement Income 
Funds (RRIFs)
These accounts are basically RRSPs in reverse. Rather than making big con-
tributions early, which is the RRSP motto, the best plan here is to make small 
withdrawals as late as possible. The annual compulsory RRIF withdrawals are 
added to your taxable income. That’s why you must shelter your investments 
inside your RRIF for as long as possible.
 
If you’re trading successfully in your RRSP, then converting to your RRIF at 
age 71 requires only that your account number changes. Nothing else in your 
portfolio needs to change. Do not be bullied.
Individual Pension Plans (IPPs)
An individual pension plan (IPP) is a benefit plan for individual participants 
providing benefits permitted under the Income Tax Act to maximize tax-
sheltered retirement savings. Larger tax-sheltered contributions than an 
RRSP are allowed for high-paid employees.
IPPs are attractive because contributions increase while the maximum 
RRSP contributions are set by law, and IPP assets are creditor-proof. You’ll 
be happy to know that when you establish an IPP to use as your trading 
account you have the ability to increase future contributions if your return 
on investments is not sufficient to meet the defined benefits. If you’re eligible, 
you’ll need the help of an accountant or an actuary to open and operate one 
of these plans due to their complex nature. The effort can be worth every 
penny, because much larger contributions allow you to accumulate bigger 
amounts of tax-deferred capital. Don’t do this at home alone.

Registered Education Savings 
Plans (RESPs)
The federal government wants our children and grandchildren to do some-
thing useful after finishing high school. Registered Education Savings Plans 
have been set up to encourage savings to cover the costs of post-secondary 
tuition and other expenses. The magic of RESPs lies in what is called the 
Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG). To us, this is free money. If you 
contribute $2,500 to an RESP, you will get $500 as a gift in the form of the 
CESG. Your annual $2,500 contribution to an RESP for your (grand) children 
is matched by a $500 contribution from the government . . . that’s $500 every 
year for free! Start early, do not mess with the money, and do not take risks 
that will not pay off unless absolutely certain. The free matching of govern-
ment grant money means your return is guaranteed to be at least 20 percent 
on your contributions.
Because the stock market in Canada has averaged less than 10 percent since 
the Second World War, no need exists for taking any risk at all. Doing nothing 
other than buying bonds or treasury bills will give you more than twice what 
the smartest money is making.
Avoid the temptation to dabble with this money by trading unless you have 
great confidence in your success. Just because you can trade in an RESP 
doesn’t mean you should.
Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs)
Beginning in 2009 Canadians were lucky enough to be permitted what are 
effectively miniature Swiss bank accounts, where you can wheel and deal 
to your heart’s content and pay no taxes. You can make $5,000 in deposits 
every year, and you can put back what you’ve taken out. When your trading 
has developed some sure-fire winners, this is the place to do it. Be careful, 
though, because this is very precious money.
We call this money precious because it’s in the only account where your 
profits are totally tax-free. Your interest income earned is tax-free. Your divi-
dends received are tax-free. Your capital gains are tax-free. Other accounts 
such as RRSPs, RRIFs, and RESPs are tax-deferred. TFSAs are tax-free. 
That’s why they’re precious. That’s why we call them miniature Swiss bank 
accounts. That’s why you use your TFSA for trading only your sure-fire win-
ners. You cannot offset your losses against your gains, and you cannot put 
more than $5,000 per year of new money into your TFSA.

 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Investment Options
Choosing the Right Broker/Adviser 
for You
Before beginning a search for the right broker or adviser, you must first 
decide what type of trader you want to be and what services you need. If you 
want to be a position trader, or one who trades infrequently, your best bet 
is either a full-service investment adviser or a discount broker. The choice 
depends upon how independently you want to operate as a trader. If you 
want advice on your stock investing plans, you need to seek out a full-service 
adviser, but we don’t always recommend this expensive option. Before risk-
ing your money on trading, however, you need to be comfortable enough 
with the language and mechanics of trading and how to conduct your own 
research. If you don’t need the services of a direct-access broker, your best 
bet is to select a discount broker.
Considering more than price
Your choice should be based on much more than who can offer you the cheap-
est price. Although price definitely is a factor in your selection, it’s one of many 
factors you need to consider. The most important factors are the services your 
broker offers and how effective and efficient the broker is in carrying out those 
promised services. Look for brokers that offer smart and quick order routing 
capabilities, but steer clear of the ones that accept payment for order flow (see 
the “Types of orders” section earlier in this chapter).
You may find an online broker that provides all the bells and whistles at the 
cheapest price, but if its systems break down at a critical trading moment 
and you’re not able to implement your trades when you want to, those bells 
and whistles mean nothing, and not being able to rely on them can result in 
huge losses. Look for brokers that allow you to test drive a demo version of 
their order entry systems.
Doing a little research
If you expect to become an active and successful trader and want full access 
so you can trade electronically through the exchanges, you more than likely 
need to research direct-access brokers. If, however, you believe that your 
volume of trades per month will be lower than 50, you may want to consider 
a discount broker that offers access to ECNs. Basically, your choice comes 
down to the types of services and accounts you need and which broker offers 
the best mix for what you want to do and pay.

46
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
 
Your first step is to make lists of your financial objectives, the types of trading 
you want to do, and the services you know you’re going to need. Talk with 
other traders you know and be sure to find out what their experiences have 
been with various brokers.
You can also research and compare ratings of brokers on the Internet. Try to 
find the annual rankings of online brokers done by The Globe and Mail every 
autumn. This survey has been published in the Report On Business section in 
September or October since at least 2001.
The most recent survey ranked 13 online brokers in terms of their costs, 
tools, trading, customer satisfaction, account information, and Web sites. 
Be aware that 11 of the 13 discount brokers are owned by banks and credit 
unions. Due to this connection, you might consider using your own bank or 
credit union’s online service for your trading. You might be able to drive a 
better bargain if you do your chequing, mortgage, line of credit, retirement 
savings, and credit cards at the same place you do your trading. Stay close to 
home until you’re confident you know what you’re doing, then seek the best 
service for your particular trading. The same banks and credit unions also 
have full-service investment advisers who are able to assist in your trading as 
well as your overall money management. You can also find a few independent 
investment firms in Canada that take pride in their independence and unbi-
ased advice.
Norman Rothery has operated the Stingy Investor Web site since 1995, where 
he summarizes the choices in finding a good broker. As he points out it’s 
often the qualitative aspects of the broker–client relationship that matter 
most (see www.stingyinvestor.com).
You can find another review of discount brokers at Surviscor (www.surviscor.
com), where sites are ranked by passive, serious, and active investors.
After narrowing down your choices, check out the disciplinary histories of 
the firms you’re considering. You can do that by going to the Web site of the 
Canadian Securities Administrators (www.securities-administrators.
ca) to find out what disciplinary actions (if any) have been taken by securi-
ties regulators. You might call your provincial regulator to be sure the spe-
cific dealer you’re thinking about working with is licensed to do business 
in your province. This information can be crucial. If you work with an unli-
censed dealer who goes out of business, you may not have any way of recov-
ering lost funds even if an arbitrator or court rules in your favour.

47
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Investment Options
Understanding how you’ll be paying
After conducting your initial research into investment dealers firms and nar-
rowing down your choices, be sure you understand how the they are paid by
 
✓ Reviewing each firm’s fee and commission schedule. The schedules 
should include the fees or charges you’re required to pay when opening 
the account and what you pay to maintain and close the account.
 
✓ Finding out how your adviser is compensated if you’re planning to work 
with a human being rather than trade online. Many advisers receive 
higher compensation when they sell their firm’s own products, so they 
may try to steer you toward them rather than another product that may 
be a better match for your trading objectives. Rarely are dealer products 
good trading vehicles.
One other level of protection that you need to check on is the dealer’s mem-
bership in the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF). Although CIPF mem-
bership won’t insure you against losses caused by market declines, the CIPF 
does give you some protection if your firm faces insolvency. You can find out 
more about the CIPF at www.cipf.ca. If you can’t find your discount broker 
or investment adviser on the CIPF’s current member list, then look elsewhere 
to do your trading.
Getting to Know the Rules
After you pick your dealer, you must be sure you know the trading rules. 
Although provincial law mandates margin requirements, sets trade settle-
ment rules, and bans free riding (nope, we’re not talking about horseback 
riding here), dealers sometimes have even more stringent rules for their cli-
ents. We review the provincial requirements here, but check with your dealer 
to find out any additional rules your chosen firm imposes.
Rules for stock trading fall under the jurisdiction of the provincial Securities 
Acts, and encompass margin accounts, securities transactions, credit 
extended based on securities, and other factors related to securities markets. 
We don’t review all the specifics here, but instead home in on three key areas 
that impact your trading choices — margin requirements, settling trades, and 
free riding.

48
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Margin requirements
The provincial Securities Acts specify how much you can borrow when you 
use a margin account to purchase new shares of stocks on margin. This ini-
tial margin requirement permits you to borrow up to 50 percent of the cost of 
shares trading over $5. For example, if you open a new margin account with 
a $10,000 cash deposit, you can buy up to $20,000 worth of stock. After your 
$20,000 purchase, your account will have a cash balance of $0, an equity bal-
ance of $10,000, and a margin balance of $10,000. At this time, all your equity 
is committed to this trade, so you cannot enter any new positions unless you 
deposit additional funds or securities. Some investment firms allow you to 
borrow 70 percent of the value of shares trading above $5, but only 20 per-
cent of shares between $1.50 and $1.74 — it’s a sliding scale for the cost of 
your loan to offset the risk of cheap shares.
If the stock price increases, your equity balance increases. If the stock price 
decreases, your equity balance decreases. In either case, your margin balance 
remains the same, $10,000. The only way to reduce the outstanding margin bal-
ance is to deposit extra cash or securities into your account or sell the shares.
When your stock price increases, your equity balance increases and you may 
use the increased equity as collateral to borrow additional money to buy 
additional shares. You may borrow up to the value of the increased equity 
balance. This will increase your margin balance.
However, if your equity balance decreases, so does the minimum equity posi-
tion permitted in your account. Currently, the minimum is 25 percent of the 
total value of all margined securities. Some brokers may require more.
In the single-stock example earlier in this chapter, if the total value of the stock 
falls below $13,332, then the equity balance in your portfolio will be less than 25 
percent of the total value. The math is simple: 25 percent of $13,332 is $3,333. 
Your cash balance is still $0 and your margin balance is still $10,000. Subtract 
$10,000 from $13,332 to determine your equity balance, which is $3,332. Your 
equity balance is less than 25 percent of your total account balance.
When this occurs, your broker will call and demand additional collateral to 
support the outstanding margin loan. This is a margin call. You may meet 
your margin call requirements by depositing more cash, or you may deposit 
fully paid, unmargined securities from another account. If you do not deposit 
additional collateral, your dealer is permitted to sell up to four times the 
amount of stock required to meet your margin call, and may sell any of the 
securities in your portfolio.
If you have more than a few positions, margin calculations become complex. 
It helps to think about it like this: When initiating a new position, you can 
never borrow more than half of the value of the position. To maintain 

49
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Investment Options
sufficient collateral, your dealer will insist that the value of your stocks be 
more than enough to cover the loan. Therefore, if your equity balance falls 
below 25 percent of the total portfolio value, your adviser will ask for addi-
tional collateral in the form of a margin call.
As a trader, you should seldom satisfy a margin call. Instead, close the offend-
ing position(s). It’s possible that an extraordinary event may cause the value 
of your stocks to fall below the amount owned on your outstanding margin 
loan. If this happens, your dealer will close your positions, but you must still 
repay the debt. Unlike a cash account, you can lose more than 100 percent of 
the money you deposit into a margin account.
 
Not all stocks can be bought on margin, and neither can all stocks be used as 
collateral. If you want to trade on margin, be sure you understand the margin 
requirements imposed by your dealer. Some investment dealers require even 
stiffer requirements to maintain a margin account, especially if you trade low-
priced volatile or lightly traded stocks.
Settling trades
When you place an order to buy a stock, you must settle that transaction in 
three business days. This settlement cycle is known as T + 3. The firm must 
receive your payment for any securities you buy no later than three days 
after the trade is executed. If you’re selling a stock, it’s probably being held in 
your account and will be taken out of that account on the day of settlement. 
Options and government securities trade on a T + 1 settlement cycle, which 
means these transactions settle the next trading day.
Free riding
No, we’re not talking about hopping a train on the sly. Free riding in the stock-
trading world can get you in a bunch of trouble, so keep reading. Basically it 
means that you must pay for a stock before you can sell it, and because it takes 
three days to settle a stock transaction, that means, in theory, you can buy a 
stock and then place an order to sell it before the stock purchase actually settles.
This is a cash account problem. Although many swing and day traders do 
turn around stock purchases and sales that quickly, they typically trade in a 
margin account and are able to sidestep the problem. Margin traders use the 
unsettled proceeds of a trade as collateral to borrow money until the trade is 
settled. Still, swing traders and day traders must have enough cash or buying 
power in their accounts to cover all purchases of stock.

50
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
 
Formally, in a cash account, a dealer may buy a security on your behalf — or 
sell a security — when either of the following applies:
 
✓ You have sufficient funds in the account.
 
✓ The firm accepts in good faith your agreement to make a full-cash 
payment for the security before you sell it.
If you do ever buy and sell a security before the settlement cycle (T + 3) is 
complete — or even on the same day — and without sufficient cash in your 
account, an investment firm can make what is called an intraday extension of 
credit (a loan), but that exposes the firm to increased risks — especially the 
risk that you may overextend your financial resources and be unable to settle 
your trades. Most firms require active traders who buy and then sell securi-
ties within the settlement cycle to conduct those activities within a margin 
account.
If you take a free ride and haven’t made some type of credit arrangement with 
your firm, it’s likely to freeze your account for 90 days. During that 90-day 
period, the firm requires you to pay for any purchase on the date that you 
make the trade. In other words, you lose the option of settling your trades 
within three days. Some firms require you to have enough cash in your 
account to complete the transaction before you make the trade so you thus 
avoid even the risk of free riding.
We talk more about these rapid forms of trading (swing trading and day 
trading) in Chapters 16 and 17.

B
ack in the old days, you’d call your investment adviser to enter an 
order and then wait for him or her to phone back and report the fill 
price. Active traders? They’d hang out in the investment dealer’s lobby, 
watching the ticker, boasting over winning trades, commiserating over losing 
trades, and shooting the breeze. In the bad old days, there were no discount 
brokers.
If you kept charts, you either made them yourself or had them delivered 
by postal carrier in book form. They arrived at the end of each week. If you 
couldn’t afford that extravagance, you’d buy monthly summaries and update 
them yourself.
Every retail investor bought and sold stocks the same way. The pros had the 
advantage, but it was more or less a level playing field for the rest of us.
Today, you’d be hard pressed to find a ticker-tape machine in any discount 
brokerage or investment dealer’s office. The Internet has changed everything. 
You can still buy chart books, but now they’re delivered via the Internet, and 
so are stock prices, real-time intraday charts, and research reports. You can 
enter orders online, have your orders filled within seconds, and receive noti-
fication showing the order’s price almost as quickly.

52
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Online discount brokers and full-service investment advisers provide a 
vast array of research and trading tools for their clients. Real-time stream-
ing quotes, proprietary and third-party research, sophisticated charts, and 
extensive order-entry capabilities make today’s traders better informed and 
better equipped than ever before.
If you’re anything like us, you’re going to spend many hours with your trad-
ing platform. So it pays to spend a little time now thinking about what infor-
mation you need, how you’ll use it, and what you may need in the future. 
With just a little foresight, you can set up your trading platform so that it’s 
effective today and upgradeable in the future without completely disrupting 
your day-to-day activities.
In this chapter, we review the basic computer hardware you need to access 
all that’s on offer for traders, explore the software options you’ll want to 
consider for managing your trading activities, and discuss various trading 
platforms and data-feed alternatives. Finally, we give you a road map to the 
options available on the Internet.
Making Use of Your Computer
Although tracking the market and charting stock prices by hand is an excel-
lent learning exercise — it gives you a feel for the market that you can’t get 
by reviewing computer-generated charts — we doubt you want to travel to 
the local library or your investment adviser’s office to research the stocks 
that interest you. (Most online discount brokers don’t have an office for you 
to visit even if you want to!) The wealth of online information that can help 
you improve your trading results is simply remarkable. In this section we list 
some of the things you can do with your computer.
Identifying trading candidates
With your computer, you can do all of the following:
 
✓ Display and interpret price charts
 
✓ Research stocks, bonds, IPOs, options, and futures
 
✓ Read analyst reports and company reports 
 
✓ Screen stocks for technical or fundamental constraints
 
✓ Monitor economic reports, earnings reports, and business news
 
✓ Monitor market indexes, sectors, and trading statistics

53
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
Managing your account
Managing your account can involve some or all of the following:
 
✓ Entering and executing trades, and monitoring open orders
 
✓ Controlling and tracking order routing
 
✓ Receiving almost instant fill reports
 
✓ Monitoring and analyzing your portfolio and all open positions
 
✓ Tracking profits and losses
 
✓ Analyzing your trading history
 
✓ Preparing your income tax returns
Improving your trades
You can become a better trader by doing the following:
 
✓ Evaluating trading systems and testing trading ideas
 
✓ Keeping trading logs to audit your trading performance
 
✓ Monitoring the tax consequences of your trades
 
✓ Staying in touch with other traders
Finding Price Charts
Price charts show the history of a stock’s price over time. These charts 
conceal useful trading information that is revealed with careful analysis. 
Chapters 8 through 11 describe how to read, interpret, and understand what 
you see in a price chart.
 
Fortunately, price charts are easy to find. If your broker or adviser doesn’t 
provide an adequate charting package, you can find excellent charting tools 
on dozens of online sites. If you have to go outside your broker’s environment, 
you may have to put up with Internet banner ads. Most of the charts on free 
Web sites display 20-minute delayed prices. You may have to pay for Internet 
charts that update in real time (prices range from $9.95 to $34.95 a month — 
we provide some examples in the next section).
At a minimum, you need control over the time frame and the types of charts 
displayed. For example, you probably want 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute, 

54
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
and 60-minute charts to go with daily, weekly, and monthly charts. Other 
features to look for include:
 
✓ Trading volume. (It’s critical.)
 
✓ Moving averages, to show average prices over time. You’ll want at least 
two types, simple moving averages and exponential moving averages, 
and you’ll want control over the period being averaged. Moving aver-
ages are discussed in Chapter 11.
 
✓ Indicators and oscillators, to help evaluate a stock’s direction and momen-
tum. We use the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indica-
tor and the stochastic oscillator. We discuss indicators and oscillators in 
Chapter 11.
 
✓ A variety of chart styles, including bar charts and candlestick charts. 
Bar charts are the most popular stock charts, and they’re the ones we 
use throughout this book. We describe how to read and interpret them 
in Chapter 9. Candlestick charts display the price data using a slightly 
different format that is preferred by some traders. The analysis tech-
niques in this book work for both styles.
 
✓ Ability to display data in a log or semi-log format. This allows equal 
percentage price changes to appear the same on the price chart, which 
is helpful for comparing the price movements of two differently priced 
stocks. For example, if a $10 stock rises to $20, that’s a 100 percent 
price change. If a $50 stock rises to $100, that’s also a 100 percent price 
increase, but it will look like a much larger price increase on a standard 
price chart. Use a log or semi-log format to show similar percentage 
changes so they look the same on the chart.
 
✓ Ability to group charts together so you can quickly scan open positions 
or trade candidates.
 
✓ Ability to show support and resistance levels, draw trend lines, and 
make annotations.
Two kinds of online charts exist: real-time charts and delayed-price charts. 
Although the charts may be identical, the prices shown in the charts are not. 
Real-time charts display current price data updated within a few seconds of 
the trade. Delayed-price charts do not show the most current trades. Instead, 
the prices shown on the chart are at least 15 to 20 minutes old.
Although many excellent online charting alternatives are out there, they 
typically aren’t as flexible or configurable as the ones offered in stand-alone 
charting packages or integrated trading platforms. And you probably won’t 
have access to trading-system development and testing software that is 
required to create and test your own trading system. We discuss the advan-
tages and disadvantages of online charts, stand-alone charting packages, and 
integrated trading platforms in the following sections. We cover methods for 
developing and testing personalized trading systems in Chapter 15.

55
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
Internet charts, delayed prices
 
Although real-time charts are desirable, they’re a necessity only for extremely 
active short-term traders. Analyzing the market and developing your trading 
plan are best done before the market in which you plan to make your trades 
opens, or after it closes. Delayed-price charts are more than adequate for 
these planning and analysis activities.
You can use delayed-price charts to identify support and resistance levels, 
display moving averages, find emerging trends, and select possible entry and 
exit points for tomorrow’s trading day.
Here are a few sources for online charts:
 
✓ Globe Investor Stock Charts (www.globeinvestor.com/static/
hubs/charts.html): The Globe and Mail provides this excellent 
resource for stock charts and other pertinent financial information 
regarding publically traded companies. 
 
✓ BigCharts (www.bigcharts.com): BigCharts is part of the CBS 
MarketWatch family. The site is free and offers an excellent charting 
package with plenty of options, including interactive charts, industry 
analysis, and stock screeners. You can define a list of favourite charts 
for quick review. You’ll also find news and market commentary.
 
✓ Investor’s Business Daily (www.investors.com): Investor’s Business 
Daily (IBD) publishes its proprietary ranking system online and in its 
daily paper. Using the stock-picking methodology developed by pub-
lisher William O’Neil, the site provides charts and rankings by relative 
strength and earnings growth. Available by subscription.
 
✓ Decision Point (www.decisionpoint.com): Decision Point is another 
subscription charting site but it takes a different approach, providing 
chart books, hundreds of unique charts, and market commentary based 
primarily on technical analysis. If you’re looking for a quick way to scan 
a large group of stocks, this site provides excellent tools. You may find 
that Decision Point is a nice complement to a more traditional charting 
site or charting software package.
Internet charts, real-time prices
Although most online brokers provide support for real-time prices, not all 
provide real-time charting capabilities. If your broker doesn’t offer what 
you need, and you find delayed prices are just too frustrating, you can find 
a number of sites that offer real-time price charts. Real-time, browser-based 
Internet charts usually aren’t free. You will generally find them priced 
between $9.95 and $34.95 per month.

56
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
 
Sites offering real-time charts include the following:
 
✓ StockCharts (www.stockcharts.com): Chip Anderson started 
StockCharts early in Internet history. He’s one of the few independents 
still around, and for good reason – the site is excellent. We use charts 
from this Web site throughout the book. StockCharts offers many excel-
lent free charting tools, but the best parts are available by subscription. 
Advanced features include real-time, intraday pricing, and the ability to 
create and store chart annotations, create large lists of your favourite 
charts, define custom chart settings, and create custom scans based on 
technical indicators. 
 
✓ FreeRealTime.com (www.freerealtime.com): The free capabilities 
of the site are fairly limited, and you’ll have to put up with banner ads 
and the occasional full-page ad that display before the page you actu-
ally want appears. The free portion of this site uses data from elec-
tronic communications networks (ECNs), not data from the major stock 
exchanges. Unfortunately, ECNs do not trade all stocks, so real-time 
charts and quotes may not always be available. And ECN prices may not 
always match prices on the major exchanges, but they’ll be very close. If 
you can put up with these limitations, the charts and price quotes are in 
real time. And they’re free.
Getting analysis from online newspapers
If you’re managing money in Canada — either 
your own or other people’s — get into the 
daily habit of reading at least the headline of 
every article in the business section of the 
two national newspapers. The Financial Post 
comes with the National Post, and the Report 
On Business accompanies The Globe and Mail.
Both of these newspapers have a variety of 
columnists and guest writers from Bay Street, 
many of whom are comfortable with both tech-
nical and fundamental analysis. 
 ✓ The Financial Post (www.financial
post.com): This Canadian investment 
paper was first published weekly in 1907 
and moved to a daily edition during 1988. 
Ten years later it became a complete sec-
tion of the National Post. Traders enjoy the 
coverage provided by Don Vialoux, char-
tered market technician, current director 
and past president of the Canadian Society 
of Technical Analysts (www.csta.org). 
He is the author of a free daily report on 
equity markets, sectors, commodities, 
equities, and ETFs (see www.timing
themarket.ca.) 
 ✓ Report On Business (www.globeand
mail.com): The business section of 
Canada’s traditional newspaper often 
includes Skot Kortje, who has been ana-
lyzing stock market trends for more than 
15 years using trend analysis. His Stock 
Trends indicators have been published by 
The Globe and Mail since 1995. (For more 
go to www.stocktrends.ca.)

57
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
Charting software
 
Before taking a step up toward a stand-alone charting application, make sure 
you explore the tools provided by your broker and other brokers and by Web 
sites offering Internet charts. Some of these online tools are powerful and may 
be more cost-effective than a stand-alone package.
Stand-alone charting software, however, often provides capabilities beyond 
what you can find online. For example, charting software packages offer 
system testing but rarely are they part of a Web site’s tool set.
Several packages are available; two examples are
 
✓ MetaStock (www.metastock.ca): MetaStock comes in two flavours, 
a standard end-of-day trading package, and a professional version for 
intraday charts with real-time data provided by Reuters, which is now 
owned by Canada’s Thomson Corporation. Each offers a variety of analy-
sis tools, technical indicators, system development and testing capabili-
ties, and access to fundamental stock data. MetaStock’s operation in 
Canada is run from Edmonton.
 
✓ TradeStation (www.tradestation.com): TradeStation is the gold stan-
dard of charting software. It is powerful, flexible, and configurable, and 
it’s designed to work the same way institutional trading platforms do. 
You can fully automate your trading system by programming your strat-
egies into the system and then having TradeStation execute them in real 
time. (Whether you should do so, however, is open for discussion.) It 
also supports direct access to all ECNs and stock exchanges.
Many other charting packages are available, but these two packages are widely 
used and give you a good basis for comparing all the other available products.
 
The drawback to stand-alone charting software is the expense. In addition to 
the price of the software, you need a data provider to deliver end-of-day or 
intraday market prices. When selecting a charting software package, make 
sure it supports the data service you plan to use. They must work together.
Finding Fundamental Information
Fundamental data — corporate information such as revenue, earnings, and 
cash flow — aren’t as perishable as price data or trading statistics, but 
the ability to access these numbers directly from your trading platform as 
they’re updated is a nice feature. We discuss analysis of fundamental data in 
Chapters 5, 6, and 7. Many brokers provide access to at least some fundamental 

58
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
data, but if you’d like to run the numbers yourself check out these online 
sources, many of which can review the raw financial data:
 
✓ SEDAR (www.sedar.com): SEDAR (short for System for Electronic 
Document Analysis and Retrieval) is used for filing most securities-
related information with the Canadian Securities regulatory authorities. 
SEDAR filing started in 1997 and is now mandatory for public companies 
in Canada.
 
✓ The Wall Street Journal (www.wsj.com): The Wall Street Journal is 
available online by subscription. It provides access to a wide variety 
of information including stock quotes, stock valuation indexes, funda-
mental ratios, industry comparisons, insider transactions, earnings 
estimates, and stock analysis reports. Delayed-price charts also are 
available. 
 
✓ EDGAR (www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml): All publicly traded companies 
are required to file electronically with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) through its Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and 
Retrieval System (EDGAR). These reports are available online to every-
one at no charge.
Finding Analyst Reports
Sometimes you can find these research reports at your local library, espe-
cially for big outfits like Standard & Poor’s and Value Line. Many analysts 
sell research in the form of investment newsletter subscriptions. We’ve used 
several of the following subscription services through the years, with varying 
degrees of success:
 
✓ Standard & Poor’s (www.standardandpoors.com): Registration is 
required, but access is free. You cannot access the full reports and 
recommendations on this site, but BusinessWeek magazine’s Web site 
(www.businessweek.com/investor) offers several complete S&P 
reports, stock screens, and industry reports at no charge.
 
✓ Value Line (www.valueline.com): The Value Line Investment Survey 
has been around for a long time. It profiles many major corporations and 
provides a variety of stock screens based on proprietary models. It also 
offers opinions on current economic and market climates. Some reports 
and updates are available on the site at no charge, but a subscription is 
required to access the complete site.
 
✓ Briefing.com (www.briefing.com): This site has free and subscription 
components. Advanced features include access to analysts’ upgrades 
and downgrades as they’re released, access to updated earnings guid-
ance, an IPO calendar, notification of changes in stock indexes, and quite 
a bit more.

59
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
 
✓ Morningstar (www.morningstar.ca): Morningstar probably is best 
known for its analysis of mutual funds, but it also provides extensive 
stock analysis, editorial commentary, a stock-screening tool, and a thor-
ough snapshot tool that shows financial performance, fund ownership, 
and recent fund transactions. You need a subscription to access the pre-
mium content.
Selecting a Trading Platform
You’ll find as many different approaches to trading as you’ll find traders. 
Fortunately, almost as many alternatives for setting up your trading environ-
ment also exist.
As technology develops and expands, online brokers are providing increas-
ingly powerful trading tools for their clients. These tools include market 
research, charting capabilities, streaming prices, and news services. If your 
broker doesn’t offer a specific service, you probably can find it offered on the 
Internet.
When selecting a trading platform, look for the capabilities you need today 
with an eye toward future expandability. You may want to consider the fea-
tures in the three lists that follow.
Trading tools to look for include the following:
 
✓ Stock trading
 
✓ Support of sophisticated option trading strategies
 
✓ Futures trading, especially single-stock and index futures
 
✓ Nasdaq Level II access
 
✓ Direct-access trading and ECN book data
 
✓ Watch lists
 
✓ Automatic e-mail or text message notification when a stock hits your 
price point
Analysis tools to shop for include these:
 
✓ Sector analysis
 
✓ Proprietary and third-party analysts’ reports
 
✓ News feeds (Dow Jones, Reuters, and so on)
 
✓ Real-time charting capabilities
 
✓ Time and volume sales reports

60
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Account management tools you may need include the following:
 
✓ Real-time account balances
 
✓ Real-time updates of buying power and margin exposure
 
✓ Portfolio management tools
 
✓ Open-order status
 
✓ Ability to transfer funds electronically to/from your account
 
Before putting your computer to work as a trading platform, you need to 
understand the two primary techniques for delivering trading tools and ser-
vices. The first uses your Internet browser to enter orders and deliver all 
information. The other approach uses a stand-alone software program, called 
an integrated trading platform, to interact with your discount broker and your 
investment account.
 
The approach that suits you best depends somewhat on your trading style, 
cost considerations, and your computer’s configuration. You may find that the 
level of service your dealer offers depends on the size of your account or your 
trading volume. You have to balance your cost with your actual information 
needs.
Integrated trading platforms typically are direct-access systems. We dis-
cuss both direct-access brokers and traditional online brokers in Chapter 3. 
Although direct-access systems are offered in browser-based configurations, 
active swing traders and day traders may require a completely integrated, 
direct-access trading platform.
Browser-based trading environment
 
For most new traders, trading volume starts out relatively small, perhaps five 
or fewer trades each month. Your time frame for holding a position probably 
is measured in days to weeks or weeks to months or months to years. You 
probably won’t be making many intraday trades, except to automatically 
exit a position after a stop price is hit. In that case, a browser-based trading 
environment certainly is good enough to get you started and may be all 
you’ll ever need.
These systems can be tightly integrated or somewhat disjointed, depending 
on the way the dealer implements them. Some dealers, for example, automati-
cally fill in order-entry screens with as much data as it can glean from your 
account. Others make you type all your data into the order screen, which 
can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Some dealers provide pop-up 
order confirmation and fill reports, and others make you continually press 
the Enter or Refresh key while waiting for a trade execution to show in your 
account.

61
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
Pros
For the most part, almost any Internet-ready computer can support a 
browser-based trading platform. Although Windows is most often used for 
trading platforms, even Apple Macintosh or Linux systems can be used for 
most browser-based applications.
Much of the browser-based information offered by your dealer is available to 
all clients, regardless of account size or trading volume. If your dealer doesn’t 
offer something you want, you usually can find it elsewhere on the Internet, 
either free or for a modest fee.
Cons
When compared to an integrated software solution, browser-based trading is rel-
atively slow, requiring you to open many browser windows and manually update 
account information. Depending on how well your dealer implements these sys-
tems, a bit more typing may be necessary to enter and execute your orders.
 
On some browser-based trading platforms, your Internet session may be dis-
connected whenever your screen is inactive for an extended period of time. 
This kind of interruption can be frustrating at best. Similarly, to operate cor-
rectly some configurations require that you use a specific browser, or that you 
download and install a special browser plug-in.
Mike’s hybrid trading platform
Mike here: My trading horizon is relatively long, 
and I don’t execute enough trades each month 
to justify the cost of an integrated direct-access 
trading environment. My trading strategies 
don’t depend on having access to Nasdaq Level 
II data or direct electronic communications net-
work (ECN) access.
However, I prefer working with a charting 
package versus evaluating charts by using a 
browser. I’ve used several popular packages, 
and a couple of homegrown applications. (Yes, 
I’ll admit that I’m sort of a geek.)
My solution was to implement a hybrid 
approach that uses browser-based tools for 
account management and order entry along-
side a software-based charting application. 
This approach provides me with access to more 
market data than I ever had when I worked as 
a broker, gives me tremendous flexibility, and 
minimizes my trading costs.
And it suits my trading style. For some reason, 
the world looks different when I’m sitting in 
front of a computer. I feel rushed, somehow, 
and I don’t make my best decisions. That’s one 
of the reasons I don’t day trade. The pace works 
against me; I get caught up in the moment and 
end up making mistakes.
I think and plan better when I’m sitting by 
myself, in a quiet corner of my home, with a 
pen in my hand. I’ll print the reports and charts 
that interest me, sit in a comfy chair, mark up 
my reports, and deliberately chart my trading 
course.
Only then am I ready to enter orders online.

Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Integrated trading platforms
For very active traders, especially swing traders and day traders, and for 
traders looking to develop personalized trading systems, an integrated trad-
ing platform that doesn’t rely on your Internet browser can be a better solu-
tion. You typically download these software programs, install them on your 
computer, and then use them to access your investment account and trading 
tools. They range from rudimentary text-based applications with modest 
graphing capabilities to sophisticated technical-analysis programs that 
enable you to design and implement custom trading systems.
The most sophisticated of these platforms provide an institutional-level trad-
ing experience. Some, for example, permit trading baskets that enable you to 
simultaneously enter orders for a number of different stocks. Others help you 
to define hot keys for fast order entry.
You’ll also find that integrated trading platforms provide support for sophis-
ticated strategies. The most flexible among them give you the ability to enter 
contingent orders, where, for example, a stock’s price may trigger an option 
order, or the execution of one order automatically cancels another. Several 
dealers will notify you by e-mail or text message when a stock hits a price 
you’ve specified or an indicator reaches a preset level. One dealer even gives 
you the ability to automatically execute trades based on recommendations 
from well-known and reputable advisory services.
Pros
These trading platforms typically are faster and easier to use and to custom-
ize than browser-based applications. The best among them have system-testing 
tools that help you fine-tune your personal trading strategies.
Cons
Integrated trading platforms can be expensive. Unless you have a large 
account balance, your dealer may charge you either a monthly fee or base 
the access on your making a minimum number of monthly trades.
Furthermore, these platforms often require up-to-date computer equipment 
with a fast processor and plenty of storage to run well. Older equipment 
will not run this software satisfactorily. And it’s likely you’ll need to use the 
Windows operating system.

63
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
Determining Computer Requirements
Few new traders actually need a fully integrated direct-access trading plat-
form to begin trading or to trade profitably. But if you’re considering a new 
computer system, you may find the hardware and software requirements for 
these high-powered platforms to be of benefit. Otherwise, you may be unable 
to upgrade your new computer to run these applications.
Decisions, decisions . . .
Most trading platforms are designed for Windows, but die-hard Mac and 
Linux fans aren’t completely locked out. If you’re starting with a browser-
based approach, almost any modern, Internet-ready computer can handle the 
task. Browser-based Internet tools usually work equally well on any hardware 
or operating system. Some sites require functions provided by a specific 
browser, but that is becoming increasingly rare.
 
If you’re planning to buy new computer hardware for trading, we recommend 
that you avoid Mac hardware or Unix/Linux operating systems. Although Mac 
and Linux support browser-based applications at least as well as Windows, 
you may be unable to upgrade if ever you want a more integrated trading 
platform. We don’t know of any commercially available trading platforms for 
independent traders (as opposed to institutional traders) that run on Linux or 
either Mac OS 9 or OS X.
Configuring your computer system
 
Regardless whether you decide to employ a browser-based approach or an 
integrated trading platform, you’re going to need a reliable computer with suf-
ficient horsepower, memory, and storage space.
Some of today’s high-powered, integrated trading software requires equally 
high-powered computer systems. We give you general hardware guidelines 
in this section, but if you decide you want a computer that can be upgraded 
to handle a high-performance integrated trading platform check with specific 
software vendors to identify any special hardware requirements. Make cer-
tain your hardware supports your software!

64
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
 
Software vendors often claim that their products can run on relatively modest 
hardware configurations; however, you’ll probably be disappointed and frus-
trated with system performance under such conditions. These software pack-
ages run much better on a computer that surpasses the system requirements. 
Trading platforms — especially testing applications and multichart, multiwin-
dow, multimonitor displays — consume considerable system resources and 
can make many computers run unbearably slow.
The following minimum configurations easily support browser-based solu-
tions. Upgraded configurations, however, may be required to adequately sup-
port fully integrated trading environments.
 
✓ Central processing unit (CPU): At a minimum, you need a 1 GHz proces-
sor. Ideally, something much faster works better. Trading applications 
tend to rely on making many mathematical calculations, so you want to 
avoid the value-priced CPU chip sets. Look instead for systems that are 
primarily designed for graphics or gaming applications. Ideally, select a 
dual-core processor.
 
 The slowest machines being sold today are rated in gigahertz multiples, 
and most modern machines have enough CPU horsepower to run charting 
application programs. However, high-end programs like TradeStation take 
advantage of specialty hardware such as multi-CPU and hyperthreading 
configurations. Check with software manufacturers for specific details.
 
✓ RAM memory: 1GB of RAM is the absolute minimum, but you prob-
ably want more. Memory is inexpensive compared with other hardware 
upgrades, and having too much of it is next to impossible. Error-
correcting memory may buy only extra peace of mind, but it doesn’t 
cost much more than standard memory.
 
✓ Available disk space: 1GB of free disk space should be enough to start 
out, but you’ll need much more for long-term storage of real-time price 
data, which will be useful for developing and testing your own trading 
system. Chapter 15 discusses methods to personalize a trading system.
 
✓ Operating system: If you’re running a Windows environment, you need at 
least Windows XP or Vista. Although browsers and software applications 
will run on older versions of Windows, XP and Vista give you more stability 
and reliability than earlier versions. For trading applications, you want the 
most reliable system you can find and afford. Windows XP and Vista may 
not be bulletproof, but they’re so much better than their predecessors that 
you definitely want to upgrade if you haven’t already. (At the time of publi-
cation, we were unable to test any applications on Windows 7.)
 
✓ Video card: Although you may be able to squeak by using a shared-
memory video system (it shares some of your RAM), you’ll be better off 
with a stand-alone video card that relies on its own video memory. A mini-
mum configuration for a single monitor requires at least 128MB of video 
memory, but 256MB of video RAM is better. You may even want 1GB 
whenever you opt for a single video card that supports dual monitors.

65
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
 
✓ Monitor size: Modern high-resolution LCD monitors are excellent and 
inexpensive. A 17-inch monitor probably is the smallest you should con-
sider. Bigger is better. Even more important than size is the monitor’s 
resolution. Anything less than 1024×768 resolution is useless for reading 
chart detail, but you will want more. If you’re going with a single monitor 
setup, consider a 20- or 22-inch monitor with resolution up to 1920×1200.
 
✓ Dual-monitor configurations: Some traders swear by the dual-monitor 
configuration. The idea is to pull up your charts on one monitor and 
everything else on the other. Many video cards support dual monitors.
 
✓ Network interface: You need some way of accessing a high-speed 
Internet connection (see the next section). Many computers now come 
with either a built-in Ethernet port or an extra Ethernet Interface Card. 
Either works fine.
 
✓ Power supply: We recommend you use an uninterruptible power supply 
(UPS). A UPS is relatively inexpensive and provides an extra measure 
of security. Some protect against lightning strikes. If you live in an area 
where power fluctuations are common, a UPS is a must.
Accessing the Internet
You must have reliable Internet access, and that means a high-speed 
connection — either DSL or cable Internet will work fine. Some very active 
day traders will spring for a fractional T1 or dedicated T1 line for an addi-
tional measure of reliability, but either approach is expensive. A backup 
connection is a good idea. Consider a wireless laptop card or even a second 
high-speed Internet connection.
A dial-up connection is not fast enough or reliable enough for trading. If dial-
up is your only alternative, you may be able to temporarily squeak by with it, 
but look for an alternative as soon as possible.
Connecting to the Internet
Depending on where you live, you may have several good high-speed alterna-
tives for reliably connecting to the Internet. Cable and DSL connections usu-
ally work well.
Because of security concerns, avoid wireless networks unless you’re abso-
lutely certain you know how to configure the network to keep prying eyes 
from seeing your private trading and account information.

66
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Picking a browser
Any modern browser probably will do. Although it’s possible you might stum-
ble across a site that uses some browser-specific functions, that scenario is 
becoming increasingly rare. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer is bundled with the 
Windows operating system at no additional charge. It will serve your needs 
well enough. Mozilla Firefox (www.mozilla.org) is another excellent — and 
free — choice.
Securing your computer
 
The Internet is a dangerous place. You must protect your computer system 
and its data against attacks by vandals, hackers, and thieves. Make sure you 
have modern virus-scanning software, and keep your virus definitions up to 
date.
Norton’s AntiVirus program gets good reviews and seems to do the job just 
fine. It can automatically update its virus definitions. You can get more infor-
mation about Norton’s program at www.symantec.com. McAfee Security’s 
VirusScan also gets high marks from those in the know. Additional informa-
tion is available on the Web at www.mcafee.com.
We also recommend that you use a firewall. The Windows Vista firewall is 
sufficient. Third-party firewalls like the free Zone Alarm firewall from Check 
Point Software Technologies (www.zonealarm.com) also work well. Zone 
Alarm monitors your connection to the Internet and is able to detect tro-
jans and worms that are trying to call home. This is an increasingly critical 
requirement. In addition, consider installing a hardware firewall to provide 
an additional layer of security. Most routers include a hardware firewall, and 
allow you to share your Internet connection with multiple computers.
Finally, keeping up to date with your operating system’s security patches, 
especially when you’re running Windows, is important. More viruses are writ-
ten for Windows than for any other operating system.
You can configure Windows to automatically check for system updates. To 
do so, go to Security in the Vista Control Panel, or System Properties, under 
Performance and Maintenance, in the Windows XP Control Panel. Select 
the Automatic Updates tab and check the appropriate settings to keep your 
Windows system up to date. You can also go to the Windows Update site 
(windowsupdate.microsoft.com) to make sure all your system patches 
have been applied.

In This Chapter

Y
ou hear plenty about recession and inflation. You know both can signal 
bad economic news, but do you really understand what they mean and 
why they happen? Regardless of what the economic gurus do, the economy 
cycles between periods of economic growth and recession. If growth becomes 
overheated, periods of inflation are likely. Inflation can also be caused when 
the value of the currency falls. For example, when the value of the dollar falls, 
that causes an increase in the price of imports and commodities like oil. That 
in turn impacts the price of just about every other good sold.
The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the Board of 
Governors of the American Federal Reserve (Fed) oversee moves that are 
made in monetary policy, and the legislative and executive branches of gov-
ernment are responsible for tax changes and other fiscal policy moves. The 
actions of the BoC and the Fed and the governments can minimize the impact 
of inflation or recession and spur economic growth, but nothing can be done 
to erase economic cycles. Markets and traders try to anticipate these cyclical 
moves with an eye toward recording gains. This chapter will help you under-
stand which economic indicators tend to lead these cycles and how you can 
use them to understand the current state of the markets and the economy.
The Basics of the Business Cycle
The old adage “What goes up must come down” is as true for the economy as 
it is for any physical object. When a business cycle reaches its peak, nothing 
is wrong in the economic world; businesses and investors are making plenty 

70
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
of money and everyone is happy. Unfortunately, the economy can’t exist at 
its peak forever. In the same way that gravity eventually makes a rising object 
fall, a revved-up economy eventually reaches its high and begins to tumble.
The peak is only one of the four distinct parts of every business cycle — 
peak, recession, trough, and expansion/recovery (see Figure 5-1). Although 
none of these parts is designated as the beginning of a business cycle, here 
are the portions of the business cycle that each represents:
 
✓ Peak: During a peak, the economy is humming along at full speed, with 
the gross domestic product (GDP — more about that later in the chap-
ter) near its maximum output and employment levels near their all-time 
highs. Income and prices are increasing, and the risk of inflation is great, 
if it hasn’t already set in. Businesses and investors are prospering and 
very happy.
 
✓ Recession/contraction: As the old adage goes, “All good things must 
come to an end.” As the economy falls from its peak, employment levels 
begin to decline, production and output eventually decline, and wages 
and prices level off, but more than likely won’t actually fall unless the 
recession is a long one.
 
✓ Trough: When a recession bottoms out, the economy levels out into 
a period called the trough. If this period is prolonged it can become a 
depression, which is a severe and prolonged recession. The most recent 
depression in North America was in the late 1920s and early 1930s. 
Output and employment stagnate, waiting for the next expansion.
 
✓ Expansion/recovery: After the economy starts growing again, employ-
ment and output pick up. This period of expansion and recovery pulls 
the economy off the floor of the trough and points it back toward its 
next peak. During this period, employment, production, and output all 
see increases, and the economic situation again looks promising.
How do we know which part of the business cycle the economy is in? 
Officially, we don’t usually find out until months after that part of the cycle 
has either started or ended.

 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behaviour
The underlying process of the business cycle is of interest to analysts and 
traders. Statistics Canada’s foray into this area has been well received by 
analysts over the years. Although no other organization has undertaken the 
work, it’s worth noting that Statistics Canada is not providing “official” ref-
erence cycle dates in the sense that the results are beyond dispute or that 
StatsCan has a legislated requirement to do so.
In identifying the economy’s ups and downs by determining the cyclical turn-
ing points, StatsCan allows a better understanding for policymakers and trad-
ers alike.
In America, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) officially 
declares the peaks and troughs. The NBER is responsible for formally 
announcing the ends of peaks and troughs and signalling when a recession 
(end of a peak) or expansion (end of a trough) starts. You can see a table 
explaining the peaks and troughs since 1857 at www.nber.org/cycles/
cyclesmain.html. The NBER identified December 2007 as the peak of the 
most recent economic expansion, but did not make that pronouncement until 
December 2008. By the time the peak was declared, the market had been in a 
downtrend for 15 months, including the sharp selloff in September 2008.
 
As you can see, the time lag between events and when the NBER makes its 
announcements can be lengthy. But it can get worse. For example, the NBER 
declared on November 26, 2001, that the peak of the current business cycle 
was reached March 21, 2001. That was eight months later. But then, in January 
2004 the NBER revised its position by announcing that the peak may have 
actually occurred as early as November 2000. The end of the trough for this 
cycle, November 2001, wasn’t announced until July 17, 2003. In other words, 
the economy was in a period of expansion/recovery for 20 months before the 
NBER made it official.
Unfortunately for all concerned, information that the NBER needs to make its 
official announcements isn’t always immediately available. The process of col-
lecting economic data and revised preliminary estimates of economic activity 
takes time. Estimates and data don’t become available immediately after a par-
ticular part of any business cycle ends. As a result, before drawing any conclu-
sions the NBER must wait until it sees a clear picture of what’s happening with 
the economy. Although many economists identify recessions and expansions 
based on at least two quarters (six months) of economic data, NBER uses its 
own models. Still, a growth spurt that lasts one full quarter won’t indicate the 
start of an expansion; nor will a decline that lasts a quarter indicate the start of 
a recession. Bearing that in mind, a time lag of at least six months is typically 
required before the NBER even considers declaring a recession or a recovery, 
which effectively renders the official announcement useless for traders.
The peak of a business cycle occurs during the last month before some key 
economic indicators begin to fall. These indicators include employment, 
output, and new housing starts. We talk more about economic indicators 

72
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
and which of them are critical for traders to watch in the “Understanding 
Economic Indicators” section later in the chapter. However, because neither 
a recession nor a recovery can be declared until enough data are accumu-
lated, finding a way around the time lag in official information is impossible.
Signals that the economy was weakening became clear to the markets as 
early as October 2007, when the major indexes hit their peaks. Looking at 
an earlier business cycle, you can see the whole process. Just as in October 
2007, clear signs the economy was headed toward a recession were seen as 
early as the spring of 2000, which is when the Nasdaq index hit its peak and 
began its downward spiral. The effects of the recession took a bit longer to 
hit the other major exchanges, but they started a downward trend by the 
summer of 2000. Just like in 2008, job losses had started mounting by mid-
2000, and many economists already were sending alarms that the economy 
was headed into a recession.
Even though the NBER announced the official beginning of that recession as 
March 21, 2001, and the official end of the trough and beginning of the recov-
ery as November 2001, no significant recovery was seen in the markets until 
October 2002. Job growth remained anemic as of early 2004. The first sign 
of job growth was seen during the fourth quarter of 2003, after nearly three 
years of job losses. That economic expansion finally picked up steam, and 
ultimately lasted through 2007.
Identifying periods of economic 
growth and recession
Considering the type of lag time between events and official pronouncements 
from the NBER, we’re sure you’re wondering how you can determine which 
part of the cycle the economy is in and how you can use this information as a 
trader. Most economists attribute changing business cycles to disturbances 
in the economy. Growth spurts, for example, result from surges in private 
or public spending. One way public spending can surge is the building or 
upgrading of infrastructure, when government spending increases and com-
panies in industries related to the construction effort prosper. They often 
need to increase hiring to fulfill government orders. Employees at these com-
panies usually receive increases in their take-home pay and start spending 
that extra money. As consumer optimism increases, other companies must 
fulfill consumers’ wants and needs, so production and output also increase in 
companies that are unrelated to the building of highways, schools, hospitals, 
hockey rinks, bridges, and other infrastructure projects.
When these same factors work in reverse, the start of a recession is sure to 
follow. For example, a cut in government spending will likely result in layoffs 
at related industrial plants, reduced take-home pay, and finally declines in 
output and production to cope with reduced spending.

73
 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behaviour
In addition to government spending, a decision by the BoC and the Fed to 
either raise or lower interest rates is another major disturbance to the econ-
omy. When interest rates rise, spending slows, and that can lead to a reces-
sion. When interest rates are cut, spending usually goes up, and that can aid 
in spurring an economic recovery.
Another school of economic thought disagrees with the notion that govern-
ment policy or spending is responsible for changes in the business cycle. 
This second group of theorists believes that differences in productivity levels 
and consumer tastes are the primary forces driving the business cycle. From 
this point of view, only businesses and consumers can drive changes in the 
economic cycle. These economists don’t believe that governmentally driven 
monetary or policy changes impact the cycle.
Which camp you believe is not critical; the key is picking up the signs of 
when the economy is in a recession and when it’s in an expansion. Peaks 
and troughs are flat periods (periods where the high or low stays primarily 
even before moving in the opposite direction) and are impossible to identify 
until months after they end. As a trader, you can identify shifts in buying and 
spending behaviour by watching various economic indicators. By doing so, 
you can discover when the economy is in the early stages of a recovery or 
recession or if it’s fully into a recession or recovery.
It’s not very often that the economies of Canada and the United States are 
out of sync. At the time this book was published, Canada’s companies did not 
warrant any American-style bailouts — well, except for the American auto-
mobile manufacturers in Ontario and the usual favours so often extended 
to Air Canada in Quebec. In fact, Canada’s economy was so admired by 
foreign investors that our dollar almost reached parity with the U.S. dollar 
again while our interest rates were at all-time lows. The escalating value of 
our dollar can lead to deflation, but our international purchasing power is 
enhanced and we do not import as much inflation.
Relating bull markets and bear 
markets to the economy
You’ve probably heard the terms bull market and bear market. To understand 
what they mean, you first need to know how economic cycles affect the stock 
market. Bulls are people who believe that all is right with the world and the 
stock market is heading for an increase. They definitely think the economy is 
expanding. Bears are people who believe the economy is heading for a down-
turn, and stocks will either stagnate or go down. A bull market is a market 
in which a majority of stocks are increasing in value, and a bear market is a 
market in which a majority of stocks are decreasing. Bears definitely believe 
the economy is either in a recession or headed that way.

74
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
You can make money as a trader regardless of whether the bulls or the bears 
are right. The key: Identify the way the market is headed and then buy or sell 
into that trend. During a bear market, traders make their money by selling 
short, or taking advantage of falling prices (more about that in Chapter 14). 
Traders sell short by borrowing stock from their broker and then selling it 
with the hope of making a profit when the price falls.
Even during a bear market, some stocks offer opportunities for traders to make 
money, including oil and gas stocks and real estate investment trusts (REITs). 
Some petroleum stocks and REITs pay higher dividends and, therefore, are most 
attractive when the rest of the market is falling or showing no growth potential. 
During a bull market, riding a stock through recovery but getting out before a fall 
is key. We talk more about trends and what they mean in Chapter 10.
Sector Rotation
In general, the markets are divided into sectors, and at any given time some 
of those sectors will be expanding, even during a bear market. Some traders 
are adept at rotating their investments from one sector to another that is 
more likely to benefit from the part of the business cycle that is driving the 
economy. This basic trading strategy is called sector rotation.
 
The American guru of traders who want to take advantage of sector rotation 
is Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for Standard & Poor’s, who wrote 
Sector Investing — the classic work on sector rotation — in 1996. Stovall devel-
oped the Sector Rotation Model shown in Figure 5-2. As you can see, he found 
that market cycles tend to lead business cycles. Markets tend to bottom out 
just before the rest of the economy is in a full recession. The start of a bull 
market, on the other hand, can be seen just before the rest of the economy 
starts its climb toward recovery. Markets reach their tops first and enter a 
bear market before the general economic indicators show a peak.

 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behaviour
As a trader, you can take advantage of this knowledge by knowing which sec-
tors are more likely to rise during the various parts of a market cycle. You 
need to buy into the sectors with stock prices that are likely to rise, or you 
can sell short the sectors in which prices are expected to fall. (We discuss 
short selling in Chapter 14.)
Early recovery
You can spot an early recovery when consumer expectations and industrial 
production are beginning to rise while interest rates are bottoming out. That 
scenario was evident during a recent economic cycle discovered during the fall 
and early winter months of 2003. During the early stages of recovery, Stovall 
found that industrial, basic industry, and energy sectors tend to take the lead.
Full recovery
When the economy has fully recovered, we start seeing signs that consumer 
expectations are falling and productivity levels and interest rates are flat-
tening out. These factors were seen during the economy’s recent period of 
full recovery leading up to the economic peak in December 2007. During that 
period, companies in the consumer staples and services sectors exhibited a 
tendency to take the lead, and interest rates had actually started to fall. As 
knowledgeable investors know, when that happens it’s only a matter of time 
before a recession follows. The staples of life are needed even in times of 
recession, so the stocks of those companies tend to benefit.
Early recession
When the economy reaches the earliest part of a recession, consumer expec-
tations fall more sharply and productivity levels start to drop. Interest rates 
also begin to drop. Most of the 217,200 Canadian job losses during the 2001 
economic downturn occurred during late 2001 and early 2002. During 2001, 
the Bank of Canada cut interest rates nine times to try to ease the concerns 
about the upcoming recession. The BoC started to raise rates in 2002, but 
then lowered them in 2003 and again in 2008 during the mortgage crisis. 
At the time of this writing, the BoC’s bank rate (the interest rate the BoC 
charges to banks) was 0.50 percent. Another key recession sign was the 
mounting job losses in 2008 and early 2009.

76
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Utilities and finance-sector stocks are the most likely to see rising prices 
during the first part of a recession, because under those circumstances inves-
tors seek stocks that provide some safety (because owning them involves 
less risk) and pay higher dividends. Gold and other valuable mineral stocks 
also look good to investors seeking safety. Though the financial sector did 
not follow this pattern in the 2008 recession, it is still typical to see banks, 
insurance companies, and investment firms perform well during the early 
parts of a recession.
Full recession
Although it may not make much sense intuitively, during a full recession 
is when we first start seeing indications that consumer expectations are 
improving, which is shown by increased spending. However, industrial pro-
ductivity remains flat, and businesses won’t increase their production levels 
until they believe consumers actually are ready to spend again. Additionally, 
interest rates continue to drop, because both business and consumer 
spending are slow, so demand for the money weakens while competition for 
new credit customers grows among banks and other financial institutions. 
During a full recession, cyclical and technology stocks tend to lead the way. 
Investors look to safety during a recession, so companies that satisfy that 
need tend to do best.
Dissecting sector rotation
Some wag once said that the stock market pre-
dicted 15 of the last 8 recessions. And although 
it’s true that the market isn’t a terribly precise 
economic prognosticator, that’s sort of beside 
the point. Economic indicators can help you 
understand the big picture, which, in turn, can 
help you make better trading decisions.
Of all the economic tools available, sector rota-
tion analysis is probably the most valuable. 
Even if the Sector Rotation Model can’t help you 
identify an economic cycle, it can identify sec-
tors and stocks that are ripe for further study.
When we trade, we want the strongest stocks 
in the strongest sectors, which is why we moni-
tor sector performance carefully. Knowing the 
sectors that are performing best enables you 
to anticipate which sectors are likely to begin 
outperforming and which are likely to fade. 
Using those projections, you can start moni-
toring stocks in those up-and-coming sectors. 
For a sector to outperform, the stocks within it 
must also outperform. You need to be monitor-
ing those stocks before they begin their runs.
Plenty of data are available to help you separate 
the strongest sectors from the underperformers. 
Investor’s Business Daily, for example, ranks 
nearly 200 industry groups by price performance. 
StockCharts.com provides a similar capability 
with its Performance Charts (stockcharts.
com/charts/performance). You can also 
monitor sectors by following exchange-traded 
funds (ETFs), such as the Select Sector SPDRs 
(Standard & Poor’s Depository Receipts) at www.
spdrindex.com.

 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behaviour
Understanding Economic Indicators
The key to knowing where, as a trader, you are during the business cycle 
is watching the economic indicators. Every day you open your newspaper, 
you see at least one story about how the economy is doing based on various 
economic indicators. Popular indicators track employment, money supply, 
interest rates, housing starts, housing sales, production levels, purchasing 
statistics, consumer confidence, shipping, and many other factors that indi-
cate how the economy is doing.
Economic indicators are useful to your trading. Some are definitely more 
useful than others. We don’t have the space here to describe each of the indi-
cators; instead, we focus on the ones that can provide you with the most help 
in making your trading decisions.
BoC and Fed watch: Understanding 
how interest rates affect markets
Watching the Governor of the Bank of Canada and the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve (which includes the seven mem-
bers of the Board of Governors, the president of the New York Federal 
Reserve Bank, and presidents of 4 of the other 11 Federal Reserve Banks) and 
tracking what it may or may not do to interest rates is almost a daily specta-
tor sport in the business press. Although members of the FOMC meet only 
eight times per year, discussions about whether the Bank of Canada and the 
Federal Reserve will raise or lower interest rates serves as fodder for stories 
published on at least a weekly, if not daily, basis. Every time BoC Governor 
Mark Carney or Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke speaks, people look for indica-
tions of what the BoC or the Fed may be thinking. Speeches by other mem-
bers of the BoC staff or the Fed likewise are carefully dissected between 
FOMC meetings. Most press coverage will shortcut all this by saying the BoC 
or the Fed may raise or lower interest rates.
The Canadian and U.S. economies tend to move in lock step, so the percep-
tion is for monetary policy in both countries to go in the same direction. 
However, that has been less true since late 2000, when the Bank of Canada 
established eight pre-set dates per year to announce its key interest rate 
policy. This schedule is referred to as the BoC’s fixed announcement dates, 
or fixed dates. In setting interest rates, Canada has recently tended to focus 
more closely on the inflation rate than the United States, which tends to be 
concerned with employment.
Because the Canadian economy is inextricably linked with the U.S., our 
manufacturing costs and output are structured around a Canadian dollar 
valued at a discount against the U.S. currency. The Canadian dollar is often 

78
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
perceived as a petro-currency by international investors: it fluctuates with oil 
and gas commodity prices. When the interest rate policy also starts to attract 
investors to Canada, the effect of a strong loonie is a struggle for our export-
ers. Higher interest rates and high energy prices causing a high currency 
exchange rate further increase the cost of our exports.
Therefore, Canadian interest rate policy is crafted with an eye to U.S. rate 
policy. Canada must be aware of U.S. interest rates in order to stay competi-
tive with the potential of expanding exports to the United States. So that we 
are not totally dependent on our southern neighbour, we undertake regular 
trade missions to the growing markets across the Pacific.
 
The key reason for you to be concerned is that a change in interest rates can 
have a major impact on the economy and thus on how you make trades. An 
increase in rates is likely to slow down spending, which can lead to an overall 
economic slowdown. For the most part, when the BoC or the Fed raises inter-
est rates, it’s because the board believes the economy is overheated, which 
can fuel the risk of inflation. An increase in interest rates can reduce spending 
and thus ease overheating. If, on the other hand, the BoC or the Fed fears an 
economic downturn or is trying to fuel growth during a recession, the board 
frequently decides to cut interest rates to spur spending and growth.
The Bank of Canada’s policies and strategies can be gleaned from its quar-
terly Monetary Policy Report. The current economic state of the nation and 
implications for inflation are covered at length. The information at www.
bankofcanada.ca dates back to 1995.
Speeches by the BoC Governor and Deputy Governor are also listed at this 
informative Web site. The speeches often are made at the press conferences 
that accompany the Monetary Policy Report or an opening statement to a 
Standing Committee of the Senate or House of Commons.
For the American perspective, you can get a good hint about what the Fed 
is thinking by reading the Beige Book, which is a report compiled by the 12 
federal reserve banks. Summaries about current economic conditions in 
each of the 12 districts are circulated to Federal Reserve Board members two 
weeks prior to the FOMC meeting, at which monetary policy, including inter-
est rates, is set. The summaries are developed through interviews with key 
business leaders, economists, market experts, and others familiar with each 
individual district. You can read the Beige Book online at www.federal
reserve.gov/FOMC/BeigeBook/2008/. Find out about past FOMC state-
ments at www.federalreserve.gov/fomc. These links give you access not 
only to current issues of the Beige Book and FOMC statements but also to 
information from those two sources dating back as far as 1996. They can pro-
vide an excellent overview of economic trends and possible shifts in Federal 
Reserve monetary policy.

79
 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behaviour
Money supply
The money supply is a key number to watch, because growth in money 
supply can be a leading indicator of inflation in situations when the money 
supply is greater than the supply of goods. When more money than goods is 
around, prices are likely to rise. Commodities and money traders will want to 
keep close watch over these three aggregates — money supply, inflation, and 
goods and services.
The Bank of Canada and the Fed track two monetary aggregates: M1 and 
M2. M1 includes money used for payments, such as currency in circulation 
plus chequing accounts in banks, trust companies, credit unions, and caisses 
populaires. The Canadian monetary aggregates can be tracked at www.
bankofcanada.ca (see Weekly Financial Statistics) and at www.statcan.
gc.ca (see Economic and Financial Data). Currency sitting in bank vaults 
and bank deposits at the central banks are not part of M1, but instead are 
part of the monetary base. M2 includes M1 money plus retail nontransaction 
deposits, which is money sitting in retail savings accounts and money market 
accounts. You can follow the American money stock measures for M1 and M2 
at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/Current. When you total 
the money base, M1 and M2, you can track the total amount of money sitting 
in someone’s account or circulating in the economy.
The Bank of Canada attempts to manage money growth through short-term 
interest rates, or through the reserves provided to deposit-taking institu-
tions. When short-term rates change, they affect mortgage and lending 
rates at banks and credit unions. When interest rates rise, consumers and 
businesses pay off existing loans. The result is slow growth of M1+ and 
other monetary aggregates. The BoC monitors several indicators to achieve 
its inflation target. The growth of M1+ provides useful information on the 
future economy and is a leading indicator of the rate of inflation. The Bank 
of Canada’s monetary policy supports a level of spending on goods and ser-
vices consistent with keeping inflation within its target range. By monitoring 
the supply of money and credit, the BoC ensures that total spending in the 
economy is consistent with controlling inflation.
The Fed decided in July 2000 that it no longer would set target ranges for growth 
rates of the monetary aggregates. In the late 1970s, money supply drove the 
Fed’s decision-making process. As money supply grew to what was considered 
out of hand, the Fed kept raising interest rates until they were so high that many 
believe the Fed’s moves actually caused the recession in the early 1980s. After 
that time, managing interest rates became a higher priority than managing 
money aggregates. The Fed didn’t kill the idea of target ranges for the money 
supply until it was certain that managing interest rates alone would help stem 
inflation. Now that the Fed has proved interest-rate management works, it 
decided it no longer needed to set a target for monetary aggregates.

Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Inflation rate
Several key economic indicators point us toward ways of identifying the risk 
of inflation. The primary overall indicator is GDP: a country’s gross domestic 
product. (GDP is released quarterly by Statistics Canada; in the United States, 
the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) tracks 
GDP.) You can also follow monthly trends by keeping your eye out for the 
Consumer Price Index, the Industrial Product Price Index, the Producer Price 
Index, and the Retail Trade Survey, as described in the list that follows.
 
✓ Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the monetary value of goods 
produced during a specific period in the economy. GDP is released quar-
terly in three different versions. The first version, which includes advance 
data, is released at 8:30 a.m. on the last business day of January, April, 
July, and October for the previous quarter. Preliminary data are released 
a month later, and the final numbers are released a month after that. 
GDP is important to traders because it indicates the pace at which the 
economy is growing. In the GDP, you’ll find numbers for consumer spend-
ing, private domestic investment, government or public spending, and net 
exports. Essentially, it includes all information about labour and property 
involving business activities inside the confines of Canada and the United 
States. If GDP fails to meet expectations set by the analysts or exceeds 
market expectations, stock prices will be affected at least temporarily. For 
a glimpse of what may be in store for the future, pay attention to the rate 
that inventories are increasing. It can be a leading indicator that growth 
is slowing or consumer demand is changing. Even though the final official 
numbers are released quarterly, the advance reports and preliminary 
reports give you a good indication of what to expect in the final numbers. 
Canadian GDP reports can be found at www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/
cst01/gdps04a-eng.htm. You can get full details about the American 
GDP reports at http://bea.doc.gov/national/index.htm#gdp. 
You can track the release schedule for the GDP reports, as well as other 
government statistical reports, at http://bea.doc.gov/national/
index.htm. Often the report is posted at the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis early in the morning before the actual release and embargoed 
until the official release time, so as a trader you may be able to get a 
heads up before the news is actually reported by the press.
 
✓ Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the cost of a representative 
basket of goods and services, including food, energy, housing, clothing, 
transportation, medical care, entertainment, and education. Each type of 
cost is weighted. For example, medical costs are weighted more highly 
in recent years, because they are rising at a faster pace, especially as 
the current population ages. In addition to the broad CPI, a core rate 
is issued that excludes food, mortgage interest, and energy, which are 
considered more volatile. The core rate is an indicator you can watch 

81
 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behaviour
for general price shifts. The financial markets, in general, look for a rate 
of increase in the range of 1 percent to 2 percent; anything higher may 
be a sign of inflation and can cause at least a temporary shock to stock 
prices. Any shock to stock prices obviously can be an opportunity for 
traders. CPI statistics are released in Canada by Statistics Canada at 7 
a.m. ET around the 18th of each month. You can find CPI data at either 
www.statcan.gc.ca or www.bankofcanada.ca. This cost of living 
measure uses a shopping basket of about 600 goods and services used 
by most households. The American CPI is released by the U.S. Labor 
Department at 8:30 a.m. ET around the 15th of each month and reflects 
data from the previous month. You can track the U.S. CPI at the Web 
site of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics at www.
bls.gov/cpi/home.htm.
 
✓ Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) measures price changes for major 
commodities sold by manufacturers in Canada. The prices collected 
are for goods sold at the factory gate. As a result, the prices covered by 
the IPPI refer not to what a purchaser pays but to what the producer 
receives. They exclude all indirect taxes, such as sales tax and tariffs, 
because this money does not go to the factors of production (such as 
labour, capital, or profit). They also exclude any transportation service 
performed by a common carrier beyond the factory gate and any distri-
bution services performed by the retail or wholesale trade industries 
(www.statcan.gc.ca).
 
✓ Producer Price Index (PPI) is an American basket full of other indexes 
that affect domestic producers, including goods manufacturing, finish-
ing, and agricultural and other commodities. The U.S. Labor Department 
collects more than 100,000 prices each month from 30,000 production 
and manufacturing firms to calculate this basket. The markets pay close 
attention to the index, because even though it isn’t as powerful an infla-
tion index as the CPI, it gives traders clues about what to expect in the 
next CPI release. The PPI is released a couple of days before the CPI, at 
8:30 a.m. ET usually around the 13th of each month, and it reflects data 
from the previous month. You can track PPI data at www.bls.gov/ppi.
 
✓ The Retail Trade Survey is a monthly collection of sales by province 
and territory from a sample of retailers. Sales estimates are a key indi-
cator of consumer purchasing patterns in Canada. Furthermore, retail 
sales are an important component of the GDP. The Bank of Canada relies 
partly on monthly retail sales when determining interest rate policy. 
Retail sales don’t include door-to-door selling or vending machines. 
Internet sales are included only when conducted through the same 
retail establishment. Canada excludes restaurant food sales, whereas 
the U.S. does include these food sales in its Retail Sales Data. Statistics 
Canada reports Retail Trade at www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/
media01-eng.htm.

82
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ Retail Sales Data tracks information in the United States about (you 
guessed it) retail sales by large corporations and by small mom-and-pop 
retail outlets. The U.S. Census Bureau, which is a part of the Department 
of Commerce, surveys hundreds of firms each month using a random 
sampling of retail outlets that make federal insurance contributions to 
collect the data, which is particularly important whenever you’re trad-
ing stocks in the retail sector. The survey looks at changes in retail 
numbers from month to month — a negative number means sales levels 
decreased from the previous month. This type of negative news can be a 
shock to stock prices, especially for companies in the retail sector. The 
data are released about two weeks after they are collected, or at 8:30 
a.m. ET about the 12th of each month. You can track the retail sales data 
online at www.census.gov/marts/www/marts.html.
Deflation
In addition to watching the economic indicators for inflation discussed in the 
previous section, traders also need to watch the numbers for signs of defla-
tion. Serious concern about the possibility of deflation takes centre stage 
when prices start falling. Deflation occurs when a sustained period of falling 
prices takes place. The Great Depression of the 1930s was a classic period 
of deflation. Many economists believe that printing more money cures defla-
tion, because (as mentioned in the “Money supply” section) increases in 
the money supply normally lead to increases in prices when more money is 
around than goods to be purchased.
During periods of deflation, increasing the money supply isn’t necessarily the 
answer. Some economists believe injecting more money into the economy 
is risky, especially when production capacity is in excess, and producers 
continue to produce goods even though prices are falling. In other economic 
situations, producers commonly stop producing when prices fall.
In early 2004, Japan faced a continuing period of deflation even though its 
central bank had lowered rates to an effective negative interest rate and 
continued printing money in attempts to prop up its sagging pricing struc-
ture, and yet prices were continuing to drop. Some economists believe the 
Japanese experienced a liquidity trap. No matter how much money Japan 
printed, prices continued downward in a deflationary spiral.
With housing prices, commodity prices, and stock prices falling, some are 
concerned that Canada and the United States could be headed in a similar 
direction. In fact, while we were writing this chapter in 2009, one of the argu-
ments in favour of the stimulus bill was to ward off a deflationary spiral.

83
 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behaviour
Jobless claims
The Labour Force Survey, another report from Statistics Canada (www.
statscan.gc.ca), is one of the most important leading indicators to watch. 
This report is the first critical economic indicator released every month 
and frequently sets the expectations for the rest of the month’s reports. For 
example, signs of a weak labour market reported in the Labour Force Survey 
usually are a strong indication of poor retail sales and other possible nega-
tive reports later in the month. The summary also breaks down data by 
industry, such as construction and manufacturing. For example, a significant 
drop in employment numbers for the construction sector is a strong sign that 
the housing starts report also will be negative.
This report can send shockwaves through the financial markets, especially 
if the numbers that are released vary greatly from expectations. Stock prices 
often fall whenever the report doesn’t meet expectations or employment sta-
tistics show signs of weakness. On the other hand, stock prices can rise dra-
matically whenever the report indicates better than expected numbers. As 
is true with any shock to the market, changes in prices are temporary unless 
other indicators also exhibit the same trend or tendency.
 
The employment report can drive markets so strongly because its data are 
only a few days old. Because it is so timely, this report is widely recognized as 
the best indicator of unemployment and wage pressure. Rising unemployment 
can be an early sign of recession, while increased pressure on wages can be an 
early sign of inflation. The report also is a broad-based snapshot of the entire 
labour market, covering 50,000 Canadian households and every major industry.
Statistics Canada releases the report at 8:30 a.m. ET on the first Friday of 
each month with data for the previous month. The two key parts of the 
report that traders need to watch are
 
✓ Unemployment and new jobs created
 
✓ Average weekly hours worked and average earnings
In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (www.bls.gov) 
produces the quaintly named Employment Situation Summary.
Another employment indicator traders like to watch is the Employment 
Cost Index (ECI). It’s especially relevant during actual times of inflation or 
when fear exists that an inflationary period may be imminent. The ECI is a 
quarterly survey of employer payrolls that tracks movement in the cost of 
labour, including wages, benefits, and bonuses. Wages and benefits make up 
75 percent of the index. The BLS surveys more than 3,000 private-sector firms 
and 500 local governments in the United States to develop the index. The ECI, 
which reports data from the previous quarter, is released on the last busi-
ness day in January, April, July, and October.

Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Consumer confidence
The Conference Board of Canada’s survey of Canadian households has been 
ongoing since 1980. It measures consumers’ level of optimism regarding cur-
rent economic conditions. This index of consumer confidence is a crucial 
indicator of near-term sales for companies in the consumer product sector. It 
is constructed from responses to four attitudinal questions posed to random 
samples of Canadian households. Those surveyed are asked to give their 
views about their household’s current and expected financial position and 
their short-term employment outlook. They are also asked to assess whether 
now is a good or a bad time to make a major purchase such as a house, 
car, or other big-ticket item. The Conference Board of Canada has revived 
the Help Wanted Index. Rather than major newspapers, the index tracks 79 
job-posting Web sites throughout Canada. This leading indicator of employ-
ment level was abandoned by Statistics Canada during early 2003 as it was 
deemed to have lost its predictive power. The index is published monthly at 
www.222.conferenceboard.ca.
Keeping an eye on consumer confidence in the United States is another way 
of casting a glance into the future of the market. When confidence is high, 
consumers are more likely to spend. The best overall index for monitoring 
American consumer confidence is the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI), 
which is put out by the Conference Board. This index is compiled through a 
sampling of 5,000 households and is widely respected as the most accurate 
indicator of consumer confidence.
Although minor changes in the CCI are not strongly indicative of a problem, 
major shifts can be a sign of choppy waters ahead. Most people who watch 
the CCI look for three- to six-month trends. The Fed, as an example, looks 
closely at consumer confidence when determining interest rate policy, which 
as you know can greatly affect stock prices. When confidence is trending 
lower, the Fed is more likely to lower interest rates. Stock markets love to 
hear about the Fed lowering interest rates. Confidence levels that are trend-
ing higher can be a warning of a pending inflationary period. A rapidly rising 
trend in consumer confidence can lead the Fed to raise interest rates to cut 
off inflation; moreover, a rise in interest rates can send stock prices lower.
The Conference Board releases the CCI at 10 a.m. ET the last Tuesday of each 
month. The biggest weakness of this index is that it isn’t based on actual 
spending data. Instead, it’s a survey of planned spending. You can track the 
CCI online at www.conference-board.org/economics/consumer
confidence.cfm.

Business activity
A number of key economic indicators can give you a good idea of what busi-
ness is doing and how that information may impact the stock markets. Key 
business indicators to watch include
 
✓ The Ivey Purchasing Managers Index: This index, sponsored by the 
Richard Ivey School of Business (University of Western Ontario) and the 
Purchasing Management Association of Canada (PMAC), shows month-
to-month variation in economic activity.
 
 The Ivey Purchasing Managers Index measures monthly changes in 
purchases as indicated by a panel of purchasing managers from across 
Canada. The 175 participants have been selected geographically and by 
sector to match the Canadian economy as a whole. The index includes 
both the public and private sectors. Index panel members indicate 
whether activity is higher than, the same as, or lower than the previous 
month across five categories: purchases, employment, inventories, sup-
plier deliveries, and prices. The index is released at 10 a.m. ET on the 
third or fourth working day of each month at http://iveypmi.uwo.ca.
 
✓ The American Purchasing Managers Index (PMI): One of the first eco-
nomic indicators released each month is the American Manufacturing 
Report on Business, which surveys purchasing managers and provides 
reviews of new orders, production, deliveries, and inventories. This 
report is released at 10 a.m. ET the first business day of each month 
and reflects data compiled from the previous month. You can track this 
report online at the Institute for Supply Management www.ism.ws.
 
✓ Durable Goods Orders: The American Commerce Department releases 
another critical economic indicator of business activity in the area of 
Durable Goods Orders. This indicator measures the dollar volume of 
orders, shipments, and unfilled orders of durable goods, or types of mer-
chandise that have a life span of three years or more. This report serves 
as a leading indicator of manufacturing activity and can move the stock 
market, especially when its numbers vary from expectations. You can track 
the Durable Goods Orders online at www.census.gov/indicator/www/
m3/index.html.
 
✓ The Building Permits Survey for Canada: This survey covers 2,400 
municipalities representing 95 percent of the population. It provides an 
early indication of building activity. In addition to data on the number 
and value of building permits issued by Canadian municipalities, this 
publication provides information on the average value of dwellings, the 
number and value of mobile homes, and permits issued for building 
renovation. The value of planned construction activities shown in this 
release excludes engineering projects (such as waterworks, sewers, or 

86
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
culverts) and land. The Building Permits Survey is released by Statistics 
Canada on the fourth business day of each month at 8:30 a.m. ET and 
can be found at www.statcan.gc.ca.
 
✓ Housing Starts and Building Permits: The American report is another 
that’s released by the Commerce Department. It can be a leading indica-
tor of the direction the economy will take. When the number of permits 
rises, a positive economic indicator results. About 25 percent of invest-
ment dollars are plowed into housing starts, and that makes up about 5 
percent of the overall economy. The report is broken down by regions — 
Northeast, Midwest, South, and West — so you can also get a strong 
indication of the strength of the economy on a regional basis. You can 
track this indicator online at www.census.gov/const/www/C40/
table2.html.
 
✓ Manufacturing Surveys: The Canadian Monthly Survey of Manufacturing 
covers 21 industry groups that produce goods for both industrial 
and consumer use. The manufacturing sector’s activity is monitored 
monthly and annually, as it accounts for a large part of Canada’s gross 
domestic product. It’s released by Statistics Canada around the 16th of 
each month at 8:30 a.m. ET and can be found at www.statcan.gc.ca.
 
 Each Federal Reserve Bank district in the United States compiles data 
from regional manufacturing surveys that can help you find a score of 
indicators including new orders, production, employment, inventories, 
delivery times, prices, and export and import orders. Positive reports 
indicate an expanding economy. Negative reports indicate a contracting 
economy. The two most closely watched are the Philadelphia survey at 
www.phil.frb.org/econ/bos/bosschedule.html and the Chicago 
survey at www.chicagofed.org/economic_research_and_data/
cfmmi.cfm. If you’re trading in regional stocks, following the manu-
facturing surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks in key regions that 
you follow can help you determine the direction of the economy for the 
areas most relevant to the stocks you’re trading.
Using the Data
You can see that plenty of data are available, but not all are relevant to the 
types of stocks you want to trade. Organizing your data collection and track-
ing the trends can make choosing economic signs and analyzing which part 
of the business cycle is driving the markets easier for you. We offer a few 
steps that can make this task much easier:
 
1. Maintain a calendar of the release dates for the key economic indica-
tors you decide to follow.

87
 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behaviour
 
 The markets may move in anticipation of this data, so if you know that a 
key economic indicator is about to be released, be sure to watch stock 
price trends for the possible impact the anticipated release may be 
having on the market.
 
2. Know the parts of the economy that are most impacted by the eco-
nomic indicators you’re following.
 
 For example, the GDP strongly suggests the path of economic growth, 
but PPI and CPI are strong measures of inflation.
 
3. Know which economic indicators are most important to the market.
 
 For example, in times of inflation, economic indicators that reveal key 
data regarding inflation are the biggest market movers. If the markets 
are worried about growth, the growth components of GDP and other 
indicators will have the greatest potential for moving the markets.
 
4. Know what the market is expecting to see in the numbers.
 
 The actual number is not as critical as whether that number was 
expected by the markets. Surprises are what move the markets.
 
5. Know what parts of the economic indicator are important.
 
 Newspapers may write headlines for shock value, but the parts of the 
index they cover may not be what are critical to your decision making. 
For example, traders know that food and energy components of the CPI 
are volatile, so the more important number to watch is the core CPI, 
which doesn’t include food and energy. The news media may focus only 
on the more volatile number.
 
6. Don’t overreact to a newly announced economic indicator that didn’t 
meet market expectations.
 
 Indicators frequently are revised after they’re initially issued. The differ-
ence may merely be related to a revision and not an indication of a shift 
in the business cycle. However, be sure to check information about revi-
sions to the previous month and how those revisions have impacted the 
current month’s trend.
 
7. Monitor the trends.
 
 On your calendar, keep track of key components of each economic indi-
cator that you watch. Follow the trends of the most important data com-
ponents to get a good idea of where the business cycle is headed.
 
Keeping a tight watch on economic indicators is the best way for you to deter-
mine at what point the economy is in a new business cycle. Waiting for official 
pronouncements is much too late. By the time they’re released, that phase of 
the cycle may be over and a new cycle may be driving the markets.

of Fundamental Analysis

M
ost traders don’t worry about the fundamentals. These numbers 
include the general economic and market conditions that impact a 
stock, as well as the financial information known about a company’s activities 
and its financial successes and failures. Instead, traders tend to focus entirely 
on technical analysis and trends that can be seen using that type of analysis.
Taking the time to analyze the fundamentals of a stock puts you one step 
ahead of the trading crowd. Using fundamental analysis, you can determine 
how a stock’s price compares with those of similar companies based on 
earnings growth and other key factors, including business conditions. This 
chapter helps you understand critical parts of fundamental analysis and how 
you can use the information gathered from it to make better trading decisions.
When starting a fundamental analysis, select an industry or business sector 
that interests you for possible stock purchases. Sometimes, a particular 
company piques your fancy, and you start your research by looking at the major 
players in that company’s sector or by turning to the sector’s fundamentals. 
Regardless of how you start, you need to narrow down your list of the 
companies you want to compare to the ones that are in similar businesses 
within the sector, so you can find the best opportunity. You also want to be 
sure the stock trades well by looking at its daily volume of trades. Stocks 
with low trading volume can be hard to get into and out of, making them 
riskier stocks.

90
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Most of the tools used in fundamental analysis require you to compare at 
least two companies operating in similar business environments to understand 
the meaning of the information. For the purposes of discussion in this 
chapter, we look at two big players in the home improvement retail sector: 
Home Depot and Lowe’s. If you’ve followed the business conditions in this 
sector, you know that both faced a severe downturn after the housing bubble 
burst in 2007. Although in 2008 they were still building new stores, they 
slowed down their expansions waiting for a better market environment.
The destruction of value that recently took place in the American housing 
market did not affect Canada as much because our lenders are more prudent. 
Also, our mortgage expenses are not tax deductible so our real estate loans 
tend to be smaller. Home Depot and Lowe’s had much more pleasant 
corporate conditions in Canada during 2008 and 2009, but our market is too 
small to compensate for the sad state in the States.
Before discovering the tools of fundamental analysis, you first must 
understand how to read key financial statements, including the critical parts 
of the income statement, cash-flow statements, and the balance sheet.
Checking Out the Income Statement
The income statement is where a company periodically reports its revenues, 
costs, and net earnings or profit. It’s basically a snapshot of how much a 
company is earning from its operations and any extraordinary earnings that 
may have impacted its bottom line during a specific period of time. From the 
income statement, you’ll be able to determine the impact of taxes, interest, 
and depreciation on a company’s earnings and to forecast earnings potential.
Every income statement has three key sections: revenue, expenses, and 
income. The revenue section includes all money taken into the company by 
selling its products or services minus any costs directly related to the sale 
of those products or services (called cost of goods sold). The expenses 
section includes all operating expenses for the company not directly related 
to sales, as well as expenses for depreciation (writing off the use of equipment 
and buildings — tangible assets), amortization (writing off the use of patents, 
copyrights, and other intellectual property or intangible assets such as 
goodwill), taxes, and interest.
The income section includes various calculations of income. Usually you’ll 
find one calculation that shows income after operating expenses and before 
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, called EBITDA. This will be 
followed by net income, which is the bottom line showing how much a 
company earned after all its costs and expenses were deducted. Public 
companies must file financial reports with the OSC and the SEC on a quarterly 
and annual basis. You can read any public company’s financial reports at 

91
 Chapter 6: Digging Into the Critical Parts of Fundamental Analysis
Canada’s System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) 
(www.sedar.com) and at the EDGAR Web site (www.sec.gov/edgar.
shtml) for American issuers.
A year’s worth of figures won’t show you much, so you need to look at the 
trends throughout a number of years to be able to forecast growth potential 
or assess how well a company is doing compared with its competitors. We 
discuss a number of good sources for finding fundamental information in 
Chapter 4.
Both quarterly and annual reports are important. Comparing a company’s 
results on a quarter-to-quarter basis gives the trader an idea of how well the 
company is meeting analysts’ expectations as well as the company’s projections. 
Also, looking at, for example, results for the first quarter of 2008 versus the 
first quarter of 2009 you can see whether a company’s earnings are increasing 
or decreasing in a similar market environment. While for some types of 
companies the first quarter is generally productive, other types of companies, 
such as retail stores, are dependent mostly on fourth-quarter holiday results, 
so you need to know what is expected in earnings for the various quarters. 
Quarterly results allow you to monitor results from similar time periods.
Annual statements give you a summary for the year. You can also compare 
current-year results to the results over a number of years to see at what rate 
the company is growing.
Revenues
The first line of any income statement includes the company’s sales revenues. 
This number reflects all the sales that have been generated by the company 
before any costs are subtracted. Rather than go to all the trouble of showing 
their math — gross sales — any sales discounts, adjustments for returns, or 
other allowances = net sales. Most companies show only net sales on their 
income statements. From these figures, you want to see obvious signs of 
steady growth in revenues. A decrease in revenues from year to year is a 
red flag that indicates problems — it’s probably not a good potential trading 
choice unless you’re considering shorting the stock.
Cost of goods sold
The cost of goods sold (also known as cost of merchandise sold or cost of 
services sold, depending on the type of business) is an amount that shows 
the total costs directly related to selling a company’s products or services. 
The costs included in this part of the revenue section include purchases, 
purchase discounts, and freight charges or other costs directly related to 
selling a product or service.

92
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Gross margins
The gross margin or gross profit is the net result of subtracting the cost of 
goods sold from net sales. This figure shows you how much money a company 
is making directly from sales before considering other operating costs. The 
gross profit is the dollar figure calculated by subtracting costs of goods sold 
from net revenue. The gross margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross 
profit by net revenue. Watching year-to-year trends in gross margins gives 
you a good idea of a company’s profit growth potential from its key revenue 
sources.
You can calculate a gross margin ratio by dividing a company’s gross profit 
by its net sales:
Gross margin ratio = Gross profit ÷ Net sales
The gross margin ratio, expressed as a percentage, considers revenue from 
sales minus the costs directly involved in making those sales and is a good 
indicator of how well a company uses its production, purchasing, and 
distribution resources to earn a profit. The higher the percentage, the more 
efficient a company is at making its profit.
 
By comparing gross margin ratios among various companies within the same 
industry or business sector, you can get an idea of how efficient each company 
is at generating profits. Investors favour companies that are more efficient.
To give you an idea of how to use this ratio and others in this chapter, we 
compare figures from two of the leaders in the home improvement retail 
sector — Home Depot and Lowe’s. Tables 6-1 and 6-2 present the gross 
profits section from the past three annual income statements (information 
taken from Yahoo! Finance) for each respective company. Table 6-3 compares 
the gross margin ratios for the two companies.

You can see that Lowe’s is slightly more efficient at using its production, 
purchasing, and distribution resources than Home Depot, because Lowe’s 
has consistently higher gross margin ratios. Both corporations, however, 
show a trend toward improvement. The advantage of using this ratio rather 
than the actual revenue and profit numbers for comparison is that it makes 
comparing large companies with small companies within the same business 
or industry sector much easier. Even though Home Depot’s sale volume is 
considerably higher, the ratio enables you to compare how efficiently each 
company uses its resources.
Expenses
 
The next section of the income statement shows the expenses of operating 
the business, including the sales costs and administrative costs of business 
operations. When comparing a company’s year-to-year results, watch for signs 
of whether expenses are increasing faster than a company’s gross profits — 
this can be an indication that a company is having a problem controlling its 
costs and won’t bode well for future profit growth potential.
When you see expenses drop from one year to the next, while gross margins 
increase, that’s usually a good sign and means a company likely has a good 
cost control program in place. The potential for growth in future profit 
margins is good.

94
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Gross profits and expenses that rise at about the same rate are neither a 
significant positive nor negative sign. When that happens, the best way to 
get a reading on how a company is controlling its expenses is to compare its 
expenses with the expenses of other companies in similar businesses.
Interest payments
The interest payments portion of the expense section of an income statement 
gives you a view of a company’s short-term financial health. Payments shown 
here include interest paid during the year on short- and long-term liabilities 
(more about those in the “Looking at debt” section later in the chapter). 
These payments are tax-deductible expenses, which help reduce a company’s 
tax burden.
To determine a company’s fiscal health, use the interest expense number 
and the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) number, which is usually 
shown on the income statement. If not, you can calculate it by subtracting 
interest and tax expenses from operating income (which will be gross profit 
minus expenses, also usually shown on the income statement). You can use 
this figure to determine whether the company is generating sufficient income 
to cover its interest payments using the interest coverage ratio. You can 
calculate the company’s interest coverage ratio (expressed as a percentage, 
this ratio provides a clear-cut indicator of company’s solvency) using this 
formula:
Interest coverage ratio = EBIT ÷ Interest expenses
 
Companies with high interest coverage ratios won’t have any problems meeting 
their interest obligations, and their risk of insolvency (going belly up) is low. 
On the other hand, a low interest coverage ratio is a clear sign that a company 
has a problem and may face bankruptcy. Whether an interest coverage ratio 
tends to run high or low depends a great deal on the type of industry or business 
a company is in. Comparing the interest coverage ratios of several companies 
in the same industry or business is the best way to judge the value of the 
ratios.
Table 6-4 shows annual EBITs and interest expenses from three successive 
annual income statements for Home Depot, and Table 6-5 shows the 
corresponding numbers for Lowe’s. Table 6-6 shows the respective interest 
coverage ratios for Home Depot and Lowe’s.

Lowe’s is in a stronger position to make its interest payments, but neither 
company is in trouble. Lowe’s has almost 20 times more income than it needs 
to make its interest payments and Home Depot has 10.5 times more income 
than it needs. Home Depot has taken on a lot more debt since 2006, when it 
had almost 66 times more income than it needed. Analysts generally consider 
a company in trouble whenever its interest coverage ratio falls below 3.
Tax payments
Corporations are always looking to avoid taxes, just like you. The income tax 
expense figure on the income statement shows the total amount that a 
company paid in taxes. A corporation pays between 15 percent and 38 percent 

96
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
of its income in taxes, depending on its respective size; however, corporations 
have many more write-offs they can use to reduce their tax burdens than 
you have as an individual taxpayer. Most large corporations have teams of 
tax specialists who spend their days looking for ways to minimize taxes. 
When you’re looking at tax payments, it’s important to review how well the 
company you’re interested in manages its tax burden compared with other 
similar companies.
Dividend payments
Companies sometimes pay a dividend, hopefully part of the company profits, 
for each share of common stock that an investor holds. This dividend is 
distributed to shareholders usually once every quarter after the company’s 
board of directors reviews company profits and determines whether to pay 
and how much the dividend will be. Paying dividends is not a tax-deductible 
expense for companies that pay them. In the past, traders have preferred 
growth stocks that do not pay dividends. However, the way dividends are 
taxed in Canada may have altered the way traders view dividend-paying 
stocks. Dividends are more attractive, because the tax on dividends is 
reduced by the dividend tax credit applied to dividends received from 
Canadian companies.
Testing profitability
You now can use the income statement to quickly check your company’s 
profitability by using one or both of two ratios — the operating margin and 
net profit margin. The operating margin looks at profits from operations 
before interest and tax expenses, and the net profit margin considers earnings 
after the payment of those expenses.
We calculate operating margin using this formula:
Operating margin = Operating income ÷ Gross profit or net sales
We calculate net profit margin using this formula:
Net profit margin = Earnings after taxes ÷ Gross profit or net sales
Table 6-7 shows the gross profits, operating incomes, and earnings after 
taxes from three successive annual income statements for Home Depot; 
Table 6-8 shows the corresponding numbers for Lowe’s. Table 6-9 compares 
the respective profitability margins for Home Depot and Lowe’s.

You can see from the numbers in Table 6-9 that Lowe’s did slightly better 
than Home Depot in the year ending February 2008. The mortgage mess of 
2007 definitely had a strong impact on both stores. Home Depot’s operating 
margin dropped by 4.6 percent from its year ending January 28, 2007 to its 
year ending February 3, 2008. Lowe’s saw a downturn as well from 2007 to 
2008, but slightly less at 3.7 percent. The drop in income for Home Depot 
after taxes are figured in was 3.1 percent between 2007 and 2008. Lowe’s drop 
in income was 2.4 percent. Checking operating and net profit ratios is a good 
idea because doing so shows you the impact of taxes and interest on a 
company’s profits.

98
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Looking at Cash Flow
When you review income statements, you’re looking at information based 
on accrual accounting. In accrual accounting, sales can be included when 
they’re first contracted, even before revenue from them is collected. Sales 
made on credit are shown even if the company still needs to collect from the 
customer. Expenses are recorded as they’re incurred and not necessarily as 
they’re paid. However, the income statement definitely does not show a 
company’s cash position. A company that’s booking a high level of sales can 
have a stellar income statement but nevertheless be having trouble collecting 
from its customers, which may put that company in a cash-poor situation. 
That’s why cash-flow statements are so important.
You can get an idea of your favourite company’s actual cash flows from the 
adjustments shown on its cash-flow statement. The three sections to this 
statement are operating activities, investment activities, and financial 
activities. Cash-flow statements are filed with the OSC and the SEC along 
with income statements on a quarterly and annual basis.
Operating activities
Looking at cash flow from operating activities gives you a good picture of the 
cash that’s available from a company’s core business operations, including 
net income, depreciation and amortization, changes in accounts receivable, 
changes in inventory, and changes in other current liabilities and current 
assets. We talk more about these accounts in the “Scouring the Balance 
Sheet” section later on.
Calculating cash flow from operating activities includes adjustments to net 
income made by adding back items that were not actually cash expenditures 
but rather were required for reporting purposes. Depreciation is one such 
item. Similarly, expenses or income items that were reported for accrual 
purposes are subtracted out. For example, changes in accounts receivable 
are subtracted out, because they represent cash that has not been received. 
Conversely, changes in accounts payable represent payments that have not 
yet been made, so the cash still is on hand.
The bottom line: This section of a company’s cash-flow statement shows 
actual net cash from operations. Table 6-10 compares three successive years 
of cash flow from operating activities at Home Depot and Lowe’s.

3,842,000
Looking at the numbers in Table 6-10, you can see both Lowe’s and Home 
Depot’s cash position dropped from 2007 to 2008. Home Depot’s drop was 
more significant at $1.9 billion. If you’re thinking about purchasing Home 
Depot stock, you’d certainly want to look more closely at cash-flow changes 
in operating activities to find out why it dropped so significantly in 2008. No 
doubt the economic climate was tough, but Home Depot faced a much more 
significant drop than Lowe’s.
Depreciation
For all companies, one of the largest adjustments to cash flow is depreciation. 
Depreciation reflects the dollar value placed on the annual use of an asset. 
For example, if a company’s truck will be a useable asset for five years, then 
the cost of that truck is depreciated over that five-year period. For accounting 
purposes on its income statement, a company must use a method called 
straight-line depreciation, a method of calculating depreciation in which 
the company determines the actual useful life span of an asset and then 
divides the purchase price of that asset by that life span. Each year 
depreciation expenses are recorded for each asset using this straight-line 
method. Although no cash is actually paid out, the total amount of 
depreciation is added back to the cash-flow statement.
For tax purposes, companies can be more creative by writing off assets much 
more quickly and thus reducing their tax burdens at the same pace. One 
type of write-off enables a company to deduct the full cost of an asset during 
its first year of use. Other methods enable a company to depreciate assets 
sooner than the straight-line method. How a company depreciates its assets 
can have a major impact on how much that company pays in taxes.
 
Although you won’t know how a company depreciated its assets by looking at 
its cash-flow statement, you will know the adjustment made for depreciation 
for cash purposes. Remember that depreciation is an expense that must be 
reported on an income statement, and not a cash outlay.

Financing activities
The financing activities section of a cash-flow statement shows any common 
stock that was issued or repurchased during the period the report reflects, 
and any new loan activity. The financial activities section gives you a good 
idea whether the company is having trouble meeting its daily operating 
needs and as a result is seeking outside cash. You won’t, however, find that 
new financing always is bad. A company may be in the process of a major 
growth initiative and may be financing that growth by issuing new debt or 
common stock.
The bottom line: This section of the cash-flow statement shows a company’s 
total cash flow from financing activities. Table 6-11 compares three successive 
years of cash-flow totals from financing activities at Home Depot and Lowe’s.
Table 6-11

(107,000)
A negative cash flow from financing activities usually means that a company 
has either paid off debt or repurchased stock. In this case both Home Depot 
and Lowe’s repurchased stock in 2008. A positive cash flow here usually 
means new stock or debt was issued. Both companies issued new debt during 
this period as well. Obviously, many combinations of various financing 
activities can affect the bottom line, but the key for traders is to gain an 
understanding of why the change occurred and whether the company’s 
reason for making the change was solid enough to improve its profit and 
growth picture.
Investment activity
This section of the cash-flow statement shows you how a company spends 
its money for growing long-term assets, such as new buildings or other new 
acquisitions, including major purchases of property, equipment, and other 
companies. It also shows you a company’s sales of major assets or equity 
investments in other companies. Tracking investment activities gives 
investors a good idea of what major long-term capital planning activities 
have taken place during the period.

101
 Chapter 6: Digging Into the Critical Parts of Fundamental Analysis
The bottom line: This section shows a company’s total cash flow from 
investing activities. Comparing three successive years of investment 
activities by Home Depot and Lowe’s, Table 6-12 indicates that both companies 
had significant capital outlays that more than likely were for opening new 
stores in 2006 and 2007. If you’ve followed the news about these two major 
home-improvement players, you know they’re expanding the numbers of 
their stores around the country in a battle for market share. Home Depot did 
slow its expansion efforts in 2008 and decided to sell off some of its non-retail 
assets, which is reflected in the cash inflow of $4.8 billion in 2008 rather than 
a cash outlay that year.

Scouring the Balance Sheet
The balance sheet gives you a snapshot of the company’s assets and liabilities 
at a particular point in time. This differs from the income statement, which 
gives you operating results of a company during a particular period of time. A 
balance sheet has three sections, including
 
✓ An assets section that details everything the company owns.
 
✓ A liabilities section that details the company’s debt or any other claims 
on the company’s assets made by creditors.
 
✓ A shareholder’s equity (also called owner’s equity) section that lists all 
the claims made by owners or investors.
The balance sheet gets its name because the total assets of the company 
are supposed to equal the total claims against it — total liabilities plus total 
equity.
Assets and liabilities are listed on the balance sheet according to their 
liquidity, or how quickly and easily they can be converted into cash. Assets 
or liabilities that are more liquid appear first on the list, while the ones that 
are increasingly more difficult to convert to cash — long-term assets or 
liabilities — appear later. The asset section is divided into current assets 

102
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
(the ones that are used up in one year) and long-term assets (the ones whose 
life spans are longer than a year), as is the liabilities section — current 
liabilities and long-term liabilities.
Current assets include cash and other assets that can quickly and easily be 
converted into cash — marketable securities, money market investments, 
accounts receivables, and inventories. Long-term assets include holdings 
such as buildings, land, equipment, and sometimes goodwill. Similarly, on the 
liabilities side, current liabilities include any claims against assets that are 
due during the next 12 months, such as accounts payable and notes payable. 
Long-term liabilities are claims due in more than 12 months, such as mortgage 
or lease payables as well as bonds issued by the company.
Equity accounts include outstanding (remains on the market) preferred 
shares and/or common stocks and retained earnings. Retained earnings 
reflect the profits that are reinvested in the company rather than paid out as 
dividends to owners or shareholders.
Analyzing assets
In analyzing assets, two key ratios to look at are how quickly a company is 
collecting on its accounts receivable — the accounts receivable turnover — 
and how quickly inventory is sold — the inventory turnover.
A two-step process is used to find the accounts receivable turnover. First 
you must find out how quickly a company turns its accounts receivables into 
cash using this formula:
Accounts receivable turnover = Sales on account ÷ Average accounts 
receivable balance
Then you need to find out how quickly a company collects on its accounts 
by dividing the accounts receivable turnover into 365 to find the average 
number of days it takes to collect on accounts.
Testing for inventory turnover uses a similar two-step process. First you 
must find out how quickly inventory turns over during the year using this 
formula:
Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold ÷ Average inventory balance
Then you need to divide the inventory turnover ratio into 365 to find the 
average number of days it takes a company to turn over its inventory. 
Comparing these results for the companies you’re considering can help you 
determine how well each company is handling the collection of its accounts 

103
 Chapter 6: Digging Into the Critical Parts of Fundamental Analysis
receivable and the sale of its inventory. Obviously, the faster a company 
collects on accounts or sells its inventory, the better that company is doing 
in managing its assets. Compare companies in the same industry to determine 
how well a company is doing.
 
Whenever you see accounts receivable rising rapidly, and the number of days 
to collect on those accounts also is rising, consider it a red flag that signals 
cash problems likely lie ahead. Whenever you see inventory numbers rising a 
company can be having a hard time selling its product — which also raises a 
red flag signalling problems ahead.
We’re summarizing these two common ratios so that you know what they 
mean whenever you see them mentioned by analysts. As a trader, you aren’t 
likely to take the time to do these calculations yourself.
Looking at debt
When considering debt, or what a company owes, the two primary ratios you 
want to look at are the current ratio and acid, or quick, ratio. You can quickly 
calculate the current ratio, which tests whether a company can make its 
payments, by looking at the balance sheet and using this formula:
Current ratio = Current assets ÷ Current liabilities
Again, like the other ratios in this chapter, you must compare the ratio of 
one company to that of other companies in the same industry. A current 
ratio that’s lower than most other companies in the industry can indicate the 
company is having a problem paying its short-term debts, which, in turn, is 
a strong sign that bankruptcy may be just around the corner. A current ratio 
that’s significantly higher can be a bad sign too, because it can mean the 
company isn’t using its assets efficiently. For these reasons, traders like to 
see companies with current ratios that are close to the industry average.
Luckily, you won’t have to calculate current ratios, because they’re easily 
found on any Web site that includes fundamental statistics. Using Yahoo! 
Finance, we found that Home Depot’s current ratio is 1.253 and Lowe’s is 
1.091.
The acid test, or quick ratio, is almost the same as the current ratio; however, 
the key difference is that inventory value amounts are subtracted from 
current assets before dividing that result by current liabilities. Many financial 
institutions take this extra step because inventories aren’t as easy to convert 
to cash. The acid test ratio is calculated by:
Acid test ratio = (Current assets – Inventory) ÷ Current liabilities

104
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
The acid test ratio is primarily of interest to financial institutions thinking 
about making a short-term loan to a company. They look for an acid test 
ratio of at least 1 to 1 before considering a company a good credit risk. Even 
though as a trader you’re not likely to be in the business of making loans, a 
company that has problems getting short-term debt is likely to have problems 
meeting its short-term obligations. As the market recognizes the problem, the 
company’s share price is likely to drop.
Reviewing goodwill
Goodwill is not a tangible asset but rather is usually collected through the 
years as companies are bought and sold. Goodwill reflects a competitive 
advantage, such as a strong brand or reputation. When one company buys 
another and pays more than the tangible assets are worth, the difference is 
added to the acquirer’s balance sheet as goodwill. In other words, it’s the 
premium in price that one company pays for another.
Determining Stock Valuations
By now the key question you’re probably asking is, “How do I use all these 
data to decide how much I should pay for a stock?” Basically, the value of a 
stock is the amount buyers are willing to pay for the stock and the amount 
for which sellers are willing to sell the stock under current business conditions. 
The actual value of a stock shifts throughout the day and usually in a matter 
of seconds when the trading volume is high.
Fundamental analysis is one of the tools that investors and some traders use 
to analyze earnings, revenue growth, market share, and future business plans 
so they can determine the value of the stock and the price they’re willing to 
pay for or sell it. Earnings and earnings growth are key factors and are 
considered a part of fundamental analysis. Common ratios used to determine 
a stock’s value include the price to earnings multiple, or P/E ratio; price to 
book multiple, or price/book ratio; return on assets (ROA); and return on 
equity (ROE). We talk more about how these ratios are calculated in the 
sections that follow.
After considering all these data, investors decide whether a company’s stock 
is undervalued or overvalued. Although past performance is no guarantee 
about a company’s or stock’s future success, fundamental analysts believe 
collecting and analyzing the appropriate data enables investors to make 
more of an educated guess about a stock’s value.

105
 Chapter 6: Digging Into the Critical Parts of Fundamental Analysis
Earnings
Using the income statement, we’ve talked extensively about a company’s 
earnings. Remember the three types of earnings figures to consider are
 
✓ Gross profit, which is calculated after considering the direct costs 
related to sales
 
✓ Operating income, which shows a company’s profit after subtracting 
operating expenses
 
✓ Net income, which is the bottom-line earnings after all expenses, taxes, 
and interest are subtracted
 
When you encounter discussions about earnings figures, be certain you know 
which types of earnings are being discussed for the stock you’re eyeing. To 
be able to compare apples with apples, you must know that you’re using the 
same type of earnings figures.
Projected earnings growth rate
The projected earnings growth rate, which shows how quickly the company 
is expected to grow, isn’t something you’ll calculate. What you will find in the 
fundamental analysis for stocks are earnings growth rate projections made 
by industry analysts based on their analysis of a company’s potential earnings. 
The earnings growth rate is included on all the Web sites that we mention in 
Chapter 4 that provide fundamental statistics. When looking for these data, 
be sure to check out the earnings growth rate potential at a number of those 
sites.
Continuing the comparison of Home Depot and Lowe’s, Yahoo! Finance 
projected
 
✓ Home Depot’s earnings growth rate was at –24.3 percent
 
✓ Lowe’s earnings growth rate was at –7.9 percent
Clearly, at this point in time analysts believe Lowe’s will lose less than Home 
Depot in the future, but they expect losses at both companies.

106
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Figuring Your Ratios: Comparing One 
Company’s Stock to Another
In this section, we show you how to calculate four key ratios — P/E, Price/
Book, ROE, and ROA — but luckily you can find all these where fundamental 
statistics are reported (newspapers, Web sites, and so on — see Chapter 4 
for more). Each of these ratios gives you just one more piece in the puzzle of 
determining how much you want to pay for a stock. By comparing each of the 
ratios for each of the companies you’re considering, you can make a more 
educated case about the price you want to pay for any stock.
Price/earnings ratio
The P/E ratio is probably the one that’s quoted more often in news stories. 
This ratio reflects a comparison of a stock’s earnings with its share price. 
You calculate this ratio using this formula:
Eyeing the most fundamental data of all
If we were allowed to choose only one piece 
of fundamental data to guide our trading, 
we’d choose the earnings growth rate (you’ll 
sometimes see this called the EPS growth 
rate — EPS stands for earnings per share). You 
can use it as a quick summary of a company’s 
performance. Evaluating the entire financial 
condition of a company isn’t necessary when 
its earnings aren’t up to par.
We put only a certain amount of faith in 
analysts’ estimates and don’t depend on them 
when evaluating trading candidates. We’re 
much more interested in actual earnings 
reported than we are in the analysts’ estimates 
for future earnings. And we’re interested only 
in companies whose earnings are growing, 
and growing at a faster rate than most other 
companies. Those companies typically 
outperform the broad market.
In Canada most of the fundamental research is 
generated by the full-service investment firms 
owned by the large banks. Their EPS growth 
rate projections are a lot more realistic now 
that the analysts have to certify that their 
compensation is not related to their views 
expressed in their EPS reports.
Investor’s Business Daily is an excellent 
source for EPS growth rate data; it publishes a 
proprietary ranking that shows which companies 
are growing earnings fastest.
As much as we like this tool, we don’t follow 
the rankings blindly. (And we don’t believe 
the good folks at IBD recommend that you do 
so, either.) IBD doesn’t distinguish between 
companies that are earning more and companies 
that are losing less. That companies can and 
do turn from losing money to making money is a 
fact, and that situation can be lucrative for the 
knowledgeable trader. Call us old-fashioned, 
but we prefer companies that actually have a 
history of reporting real, positive earnings.

107
 Chapter 6: Digging Into the Critical Parts of Fundamental Analysis
P/E ratio = Stock price ÷ Earnings per share
You’ll probably find two types of P/E ratios for a stock. The trailing P/E is 
based on earnings reported in previous quarters, and the forward P/E is 
based on projected earnings. At Yahoo! Finance, the trailing P/E for Home 
Depot was 12.29, and its forward P/E, expectations as of February 3, 2010, 
was 13.68. Lowe’s trailing P/E was 12.28, and its forward P/E, expectations as 
of February 1, 2010, was 14.16. Little difference exists in the trailing P/E ratios 
for Home Depot and Lowe’s, but analysts seem to favour Lowe’s with a higher 
forward P/E. Historically, market analysts believed a P/E ratio of 10 to 15 was 
reasonable. For a while, much higher P/Es were tolerated, but during the 2008 
market conditions people drifted back to historical P/Es. When comparing 
companies, you can get a good idea of how the market values each stock by 
looking at its P/E ratio. While the P/E ratio is actually a percentage, it is rarely 
stated that way. However, you will sometimes hear it called a price multiple 
because the P/E ratio represents how much you are paying for each dollar of 
a company’s earnings.
Price/book ratio
The price/book ratio compares the market’s valuation of a company to the 
value that the company shows on its financial statements. The higher the 
ratio, the more the market is willing to pay for a company above its hard 
assets, which include its buildings, inventory, accounts receivable, and other 
clearly measurable assets. Companies are more than their measurable assets. 
Customer loyalty, the value of their locations, and other intangible assets 
add value to a company. Investors looking to buy based on value rather than 
growth are more likely to check out the price/book ratio. Price/book ratios 
are calculated using this formula:
Price/book ratio = Stock price ÷ (Book value – Total liabilities)
Lowe’s price/book ratio at Yahoo! Finance was 1.88 and Home Depot’s was 
2.26. Based on price/book ratio, the market is willing to pay a higher premium 
for Home Depot’s stock.
Return on assets
Return on assets (ROA) shows you how efficiently management uses the 
company’s resources. ROA doesn’t, however, show you how well the 
company is performing for its shareholders. To calculate return on assets, 
use this formula:
Return on assets = Earnings after taxes ÷ Total assets

108
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Home Depot’s ROA at Yahoo! Finance was 7.78 percent; Lowe’s was 8.89 
percent. Lowe’s is doing a more efficient job using its resources based on 
those two ROA numbers.
Return on equity
Investors are more interested in return on equity (ROE), which measures how 
well a company is doing for its shareholders. This ratio measures how much 
profit management generates from resources provided by its shareholders. 
Investors look for companies with high ROEs that show signs of growth. You 
calculate ROE by using this formula:
Return on equity = Earnings after taxes ÷ Shareholder equity
Home Depot’s ROE was 14.40 percent, and Lowe’s was 15.51 percent.
The ROEs show that Lowe’s is doing a better job for its shareholders, which, 
again, is reflected in the price investors are willing to pay for its shares.
As a trader, you may not make your buy and sell decisions based on 
fundamental analysis, but collecting and having access to this information as 
part of your arsenal certainly helps you to make better and more informed 
stock choices. Knowing a company has strong fundamentals helps to back up 
what you’re seeing in the technical analysis (see Part III). If you’re trying to 
decide between two stocks whose technical charts are positive, you can use 
the fundamental analysis to tip the scale toward your best trading opportunity.

S
tock analysts are supposed to be independent oracles who help mere 
mortal traders understand a company’s financial future. Don’t count 
on them to walk on water, however, because they’re not always looking to 
protect the small investor’s pocketbook.
A wide spectrum of analysis is undertaken in Canada. Professional authors of 
investment research range from quality analysts to penny stock promoters. 
Whenever you read recommendations from an analyst, you must determine 
whether that analyst is a buy-side analyst, sell-side analyst, or independent 
analyst before you ever consider using the information he or she is providing.
Analysts get much of their information from conference calls sponsored 
by companies when they report their earnings or make other key financial 
announcements. Today, individual investors are invited to listen in on more 
and more of these calls. You can find out a great deal about a company’s 
prospects by listening in on analyst calls, but the language of these calls can 
be confusing. This chapter explains the types of analysts, their importance, 
and the language unique to what they do. We also introduce you to some 
Internet resources that can make listening in on analyst calls easier.

110
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Getting to Know Your Analysts
If you watch any of the financial news cable television stations, you’ve 
probably seen numerous industry analysts frequently touting certain stocks 
and panning others. Do you know who those analysts represent? Do you 
know whether they’re independent analysts, buy-side analysts, or sell-side 
analysts? Before deciding whether to follow an analyst’s recommendations, 
be sure you understand who pays his or her salary and what’s in it for him 
or her.
Buy-side analysts: You won’t see them
You rarely come in contact with a buy-side analyst, because they work 
primarily for large institutional investment firms that manage mutual funds 
or private accounts. Their primary role is analyzing stocks that are bought 
by the firm for which they work and not necessarily the ones bought by 
individual investors. Their research rarely is available outside the firm that 
hired them. Buy-side analysts focus on whether an investment that’s under 
consideration is a good match for the firm’s investment strategy and portfolio. 
In fact, buy-side analysts frequently include information from sell-side 
analysts as part of their overall research on an investment. You’re most 
likely to hear from a buy-side analyst if you listen to analyst conference 
calls. They tend to be much harsher on the company officials.
Sell-side analysts: Watch for conflicts
When you read stock analyses from investment dealers, you’re more than 
likely reading information from sell-side analysts. These analysts work 
primarily for brokerage houses and other financial distribution sources 
where salespeople sell securities based on the analysts’ recommendations.
The primary purpose of sell-side analysts is providing investment advisers 
with information to help make sales. As long as the interests of the investor, 
the adviser, and the investment dealer are the same, sell-side analysts’ 
reports can be useful sources of information. A conflict arises, however, 
when sell-side analysts also are responsible for helping their investment 
dealers win investment banking business.
New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer (yes, that Eliot Spitzer) 
exposed why this conflict is a primary reason for all the scandals you’ve read 
about regarding star analysts, such as Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch (and 

111
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
formerly CIBC Oppenheimer), whose e-mails privately called stocks “dogs,” 
“toast,” or “junk” at the same time he and his team were publicly recommending 
that their customers buy the same stocks. Why do this? Well, according to 
Spitzer’s charges, Blodget’s recommendations brought in $115 million in 
investment banking fees for Merrill Lynch, and Blodget took home $12 million 
in compensation.
Merrill Lynch was only the first to be exposed. Similar charges were raised 
against many other firms, including Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, and Credit 
Suisse First Boston. Few firms that sell stocks and have an investment banking 
division avoided the scandal. These companies didn’t learn much from the 
scandals. Merrill Lynch was taken over by Bank of America because of errors 
made during the mortgage crisis.
At one time in the distant past, analysts were separated from investment 
banks by what companies called a “Chinese wall.” Analysts’ work supposedly 
was kept completely separate from deals that were being generated in a 
company’s investment banking business. At some point, the lines between 
the two broke down and analysts actually were included in the process of 
generating deals for mergers, acquisitions, and new stock offerings. By 
writing glowing reports, analysts helped their companies sign more lucrative 
investment banking deals, all the while putting their small investors at great 
risk of losing all their money by buying the recommended stocks. When the 
market bubble burst in 2000, many of the stocks that were recommended 
because of these deals, particularly in the Internet, telecommunications, and 
other high-tech industries, dropped to being worthless, and investors lost 
billions.
Merrill Lynch, in trying to settle its problems with Spitzer, agreed to publicly 
disclose its investment banking connections and list its clients. As of June 
2002, Merrill Lynch began stating in all its research reports whether it 
received or will receive fees for investment banking services from any 
company that was followed by the Merrill Lynch analysts in the prior 12 
months. Other companies followed Merrill Lynch’s lead in settling their 
disputes with Spitzer.
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally stepped 
into the fray in April 2002 and announced it was broadening the investigation 
into analysts’ roles and was developing new regulations regarding analyst 
disclosure. The SEC ultimately endorsed rulemaking changes recommended 
by the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities 
Dealers, including the following:
 
✓ Structural reforms that increase analysts’ independence. These reforms 
include a prohibition on investment banking departments supervising 
analysts or approving research reports.

112
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ A prohibition on tying analysts’ compensation to specific investment 
banking transactions.
 
✓ A prohibition on offering favourable research to induce business for the 
firm.
 
✓ Increased disclosures of conflicts of interest in research reports and 
public appearances. These disclosures include information about 
business relationships with or ownership interests in companies that 
are the subjects of analysts’ reports.
 
✓ Disclosure in research reports of data concerning a firm’s ratings, such 
as the percentage of ratings issued in each of the buy, hold, and sell 
categories, and a price chart comparing the rated securities’ closing 
prices and the firm’s rating or price targets over time.
 
✓ Restrictions on personal trading by analysts in securities of companies 
that they analyze and/or report on.
 
Today, rules are made by FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority). 
These rule changes helped investors identify conflicts of interest that can 
compromise the objectivity of the sell-side analyst’s report. Pay close 
attention to the disclosures and the relationships between the investment 
dealers and the companies that their analysts’ reports cover, and take 
these connections into consideration when including their buy or sell 
recommendations in your plans for future stock transactions.
Although Canada can boast of its shares of rogues, we haven’t seen something 
on the scale of what went down between Spitzer and Blodget. For many 
years, Canadian research analysts have been subject to a thorough regimen 
of disclosure.
Research disclosures include the following:
 
✓ The proportion of buy, sell, and hold reports. No use relying on 
research that’s meant to be objective if it’s always buy, buy, buy!
 
✓ Recent underwritings or investment banking services provided for the 
companies being researched. You don’t need research that’s written 
just to pump up stocks so the researcher’s employer can sell you more 
stocks.
 
✓ Conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest can arise in many and varied 
forms. Analysts or their families owning or shorting shares of the 
companies being covered is a HUGE conflict of interest you need to 
know about. Similarly, it can be very bad if the analyst’s employer is 
a bank that’s lending money too optimistically to the company being 
analyzed. And watch out for analysts who are compensated or who 
have their expenses taken care of by the subject of the research — also 
known as the gravy train. Finally, compensation should not be tied to 
research recommendations (in other words, analysts are not paid less 
for writing the truth). 

113
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
Independent analysts: Where are they?
You’re probably wondering where these independent analysts — people 
you can trust who don’t have investment banking connections — really are. 
Although they do exist, most work for wealthy individuals or institutional 
investors and provide research for people who manage portfolios of much 
more than a million dollars and pay fees of at least $25,000 per year.
No one really knows exactly how many independent analysts are out there. 
Estimates range from 100 to several hundred, but their ranks surely will grow 
now that independent research will be a required part of selling to individual 
investors.
 
In addition to independent research that you probably see distributed by 
your investment dealer, as a small investor you can turn to some of the major 
investment research firms such as Morningstar (www.morningstar.ca) and 
Standard & Poor’s (www.standardandpoors.com). They offer services to indi-
vidual investors through their publications and Internet sites at more reason-
able fees than many of the small independent analyst firms. Nevertheless, you 
need to bear in mind that even these analysts are answering to the companies 
or wealthy individuals that pay the greatest share of their costs.
The Importance of Analysts
No matter whose report you’re reading, remember that the analyst’s primary 
income is coming either from the investment dealer or the large institutional 
clients that he or she serves. Analysts rate stocks on whether you need to 
consider purchasing them, but no standardized rating system exists. In Table 
7-1 we offer the three most common breakdowns you can expect to see.
Table 7-1 
Common Stock Recommendations from Analysts

Analysis by Company C
Buy
Strong Buy
Recommended List

Avoid
Market Underperformer
You can see from this table that you must understand how a company’s 
analysts rate stocks for that company’s recommendations to have any value. 
Company A’s “Buy” recommendation is its highest, but Company B uses 

114
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
“Strong Buy” for its highest rating, and Company C uses “Recommended List” 
for its top choice. Merely seeing that a stock is recommended as a “Buy” by a 
particular analyst means little if you don’t know which rating system is being 
used.
 
Unfortunately, when it comes to stock analysis, if the information is free 
it’s probably no better than that free lunch you’re always looking to find. 
Someone has to pay the analyst, and if it isn’t you, you must find out who is 
footing the bill before you use that advice to make decisions.
The best way to use analysts’ reports is to think of them as just one tool in 
your bucket of trading tools. Analysts’ opinions are one good way to find out 
about an industry or a stock, but they’re not the final word about what you 
need to do. Only your own research using fundamental and technical analysis 
can help you make your investment decisions. We discuss fundamental 
analysis tools in Chapters 5 and 6 and technical analysis tools in Part III.
Tracking how a company’s doing
Analysts are good resources for finding historical data about how a company 
or industry is doing. Their reports usually summarize at least five years of 
data and frequently provide a historical perspective for the industry and 
the company that goes back many more years. In addition, analysts make 
projections about the earnings potential of the company they’re analyzing 
and indicate why they believe those projections by including information 
about new products being developed or currently being tested at various 
stages of market development.
 
These reports help you track how a company is doing so you can find the 
gems that may indicate when to expect a company to break out of a current 
trading trend. For example, if an analyst covering a pharmaceutical company 
mentions that a new drug is under consideration by the Food and Drug 
Administration, you may look for news stories about the status of that 
drug and monitor the stock for indications that drug approval may soon be 
announced. Watching the technical charts may help you jump in at just the 
right time and catch the upward trend as positive news is announced. Stocks 
usually start to move in advance of news.
Providing access to analyst calls
In addition to reading reports, you can track companies by listening in on 
analyst calls. Some calls are sponsored by the companies themselves to 
review annual or quarterly results, and others are sponsored by independent 
analysts.

115
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
Company-sponsored calls
Analyst calls sponsored by companies more often are earnings conference 
calls primarily for institutional investors as well as Bay Street and Wall Street 
analysts. They occur on either a quarterly, semiannual, or annual basis, 
and can be the richest sources of information concerning a company’s 
fundamentals and future prospects.
Senior management — usually the chief executive officer (CEO), president, 
and chief financial officer (CFO) — talks about the company’s financial 
reports and then answers questions during these calls. The calls sometimes 
are scheduled to coincide with announcements of major changes in a company’s 
leadership or other breaking news about the company. After a formal 
statement, senior management answers questions from analysts. That’s 
when you usually can get the most up-to-date information about the company 
and how management views its financial performance and projections. We 
discuss how to read between the lines and get the most out of these calls in 
the next section of this chapter.
Access to these calls used to be limited to professional analysts and institutional 
investors, but today more than 80 percent of companies that sponsor analyst 
calls open them to the media and individual investors, according to a survey 
conducted by the American National Investor Relations Institute. This change 
primarily is credited to the SEC’s Fair Disclosure (FD) Regulation, which 
requires companies to make public all major announcements that can impact 
the value of the stock within 24 hours of informing any company outsiders. 
This rule helps level the information playing field for individual investors.
Analysts no longer can count on getting two or three days of lead time on 
major announcements, which heretofore helped them inform major investors 
about company news. Often that amount of lead time enabled analysts to rec-
ommend buy or sell decisions to their key clients, but that same practice hurt 
small investors and traders who weren’t privy to the news. Some complain this 
new rule actually hurt the flow of information, because companies clammed 
up in private conversations with analysts, making it harder for the analysts to 
write their investigative reports. Since the regulation first took effect in 2000, 
the fair disclosure rule helped to level the information playing field.
Independent analyst–sponsored calls
Firms that provide independent analysis also sponsor calls primarily for their 
wealthy and institutional clients. During these calls, analysts often discuss 
breaking news about a company or an industry that they follow. Doing so 
gives their clients an opportunity to discuss key concerns directly with the 
analysts. Unless you’re a client, opportunities for listening in on these calls 
are rare.

116
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Listening to Analyst Calls
Most company conference calls start with a welcome to all call participants, 
followed by a discussion of the financial results being released or the purpose 
the company has designated for the call. After the CEO, president, and CFO 
make their statements, other key managers may comment on the results 
before the call is opened to questions from the listening audience.
The question-and-answer portion of the call usually is the most revealing 
and enables you to judge just how confident senior managers are with their 
reporting. It’s when you’re most likely to hear information that hasn’t been 
revealed in press releases or formal annual or quarterly reports. Analysts 
and institutional investors usually are given the first shot at asking questions, 
meaning before other listeners, the press, or individual investors get their 
turn. Not all companies permit individual investors to ask questions. Even 
when you can’t ask any questions, listening to responses to the questions 
posed by analysts, institutional investors, and the media still is worthwhile.
Seeking insider information
Investors began seeking insider information 
about companies long before the scandals 
that you now read about almost daily. In fact, 
one of the first stories ever told about trading 
on insider information involved the startup of 
one of today’s leading financial information 
services — Reuters. Julius Reuter started 
his news service in response to the desire 
investors had for insider information and how it 
could impact stock prices. In 1849, Reuter used 
trained homing pigeons to fly information about 
closing stock prices from Europe’s mainland 
across the English Channel to England, thus 
giving his subscribers a jump on news about a 
stock so they’d be able to react before other, less 
informed investors received the information. 
This story highlights a simple but powerful 
secret of investing: Information is power. 
Investors with privileged access to information 
hold a distinct advantage over other investors 
who don’t have the same access.
Just to give you an idea of how insider 
information was used by analysts more 
recently, here are a couple of examples. In 
February 1999, during a tour of the headquarters 
of Compaq Computer Corporation, the 
company’s treasurer told a group of big-time 
investors that he was concerned about 
softness in the software industry. Compaq 
shares dropped 14 percent before most 
individual investors ever discovered such a 
concern existed. In September 1999, executives 
at Apple Computer Inc. called analysts to alert 
them that an earthquake in Taiwan disrupted 
the production of iBook and Powerbook 
notebook computers. The Apple execs wanted 
to warn analysts that the company would not 
meet its numbers for the quarter. The stock 
fell 7 percent in four days, and again, by the 
time most investors found out, it was too late. 
The new SEC fair disclosure rule attempts to 
prevent this kind of favoured treatment for 
insiders.

117
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
 
Be sure to listen closely; chances are good that any question you may have 
will be answered during the question-and-answer period. If not, you can 
always write or call the company’s investor relations division to get an answer 
to your specific question.
Understanding the analysts’ language
We recommend that before your first call you get familiar with some of the 
language you’ll hear. We discuss most of the common terminology in Chapter 
6, including earnings per share (EPS), EPS growth, net income, cash, and cash 
equivalents. However, some terms are unique to the analyst call world. These 
include:
 
✓ Hockey stick: When companies say their revenues come in like a hockey 
stick, company officials are not exactly talking about getting hit with a 
puck. Instead, they’re talking about the shape of a hockey stick. Because 
most of their revenues are booked in the final days of the quarter, 
revenue charts take on the appearance of a hockey stick. Most companies, 
in fact, book revenues this way, because sales incentives are designed 
to encourage the sales force to close their contracts before the end of a 
quarter. Salespeople have to meet their quotas, and companies that are 
planning purchases frequently delay those decisions until near the end 
of a quarter so they can negotiate the best deals when the salespeople 
are most desperate. You’ve probably done the same thing yourself when 
buying a car or other major item.
 
✓ Lumpy: Nope, the CEO isn’t talking about poorly cooked oatmeal when 
he or she says revenues or orders were lumpy. This term means that 
sales were uneven during the quarter, with some weeks having low 
order rates and others having high order rates. The key is finding out 
why sales were lumpy and whether lumpy sales are normal for the 
company.
 
✓ Run rate: Don’t worry, you won’t be asked how fast you can run a race. 
The run rate is the way senior management talks about how its current 
performance can be projected over a period of time. For example, if the 
current quarter’s revenues show a $1 million monthly run rate, then you 
can expect annual revenues to total close to $12 million. This concept 
may work for companies with steady earnings but not for companies 
whose products primarily are seasonal. For example, if a retail company 
reports a run rate of $1 million per month during the fourth quarter, 
which of course includes holiday sales, you won’t expect that performance 
to be indicative of a full 12-month performance. You must be certain you 
understand a company’s revenue picture before counting on run-rate 
numbers.

118
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ Burn rate: Nope, nothing to do with matchsticks or fireworks. Burn 
rate refers to negative cash flow. If a company has monthly expenses of 
$1 million, no revenue, and only $6 million in the bank, then its burn rate 
tells you it will be bankrupt or raising more capital within six months.
 
If you hear other terminology that you don’t understand, write it down so you 
can research it and thus be ready for the next time you hear it.
Developing your listening skills
In addition to what senior management is saying, you also need to listen to 
how they’re saying it. If management is happy with the results, they’ll probably 
be upbeat and talking about a rosy future for the company. On the other 
hand, if management isn’t so happy with the results, the mood probably will 
be downbeat and apologetic as they try to explain why the company didn’t 
perform as expected and, of course, make excuses for their failure to meet 
expectations.
Learn to listen and read between the company lines. Try to listen in on every 
earnings call. The first one you hear may not mean much unless you know 
how the results differ from previous reports and projections. Before that first 
call, you need to read analysts’ reports and become as familiar as possible 
with the company’s earnings history. After you’ve followed a certain company’s 
calls for a while, the information presented will mean much more to you. 
Among the many indicators that may help you determine your trading 
activity are signs relating to earnings expectations, revenue growth, analysts’ 
moods, company facts, and future projections.
Earnings expectations
Whether a company is meeting its own projections and analysts’ expectations 
is the most important clue about how a company is doing and how the stock 
market will react to its periodic reports. If the company fails to meet 
expectations, the market will likely punish the stock by driving the price 
down, and that can point to a good trading opportunity. If you believe the 
setback is temporary and the company’s long-term prospects look good, you 
may want to wait for the stock to bottom out before buying it. If you think 
failing periodic expectations is a sign of long-term bad news, and you hold a 
position in the stock, you may want to sell it as soon as possible. If you don’t 
own it, you may want to consider shorting the stock. We discuss shorting a 
stock at length in Chapter 18.
Revenue growth
Listen for information that indicates whether revenue growth kept pace 
with earnings growth. This factor becomes even more critical whenever the 

119
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
economy slows down, because a company may play with or manipulate the 
numbers in a practice that’s known as window dressing, or making sure that 
earnings meet expectations. However, manipulating revenues is much more 
difficult. Growth in revenues is the key to continued earnings growth in the 
future.
Although manipulating earnings may be difficult, we’ve seen companies do 
it successfully for at least a few quarters and, in some cases, a few years. 
A number of companies caught in recent scandals successfully manipulated 
these numbers with creative methods of booking revenue. One place where 
you may want to watch for signs of revenue manipulation is accounts 
receivable. If receivables rise dramatically above historical balances, one of 
two things are likely — the company is having a hard time collecting on its 
accounts, or the company is booking fictitious revenue. Manipulation may 
also be detected when a company reports revenue for items sold that 
actually is greater than the company has the capacity to produce.
Canadian telecom Nortel brings such creativity to mind. In a nutshell, 
Nortel’s customers couldn’t afford to buy Nortel’s products, so Nortel lent 
them the money and then reported the sale! The phrase at the time that 
described that fad was a deadly form of vendor take-back financing. RIP, 
Nortel.
 
You may notice analysts questioning revenue-growth figures in great detail. 
This examination by analysts can be a sign that they suspect problems with 
the numbers. Detecting any of these signs while listening to a call can be a sign 
of possible trouble ahead, and you need to take a closer look before buying 
the stock or holding what you already have.
Analysts’ moods
You can find out a great deal about how analysts are responding to a company’s 
report by merely listening to the tone of their questions. By listening to how 
analysts are asking questions and what questions they are asking, you can 
judge whether the analysts are downbeat on company prospects, especially 
if they’re asking increasingly probing questions. On the other hand, you may 
notice that analysts are upbeat and encouraging senior management to talk 
even more positively about their results and future plans. When you’ve followed 
the analysts’ calls for a company during several quarters, recognizing whether 
the mood has changed won’t be difficult. When analysts receive news 
positively, they often start their questions with some kind of congratulatory 
remark.
Be sure to jot down the names of analysts, especially the ones making positive 
remarks. The positive remarks from analysts with sell-side orientation may 
not be as good a sign as the positive remarks from buy-side analysts. If you 
don’t know what type of analyst is commenting, research his or her affiliations 
and leanings after the call.

120
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
 
Buy-side analysts carry the most weight whenever they’re indicating a positive 
reaction to the company’s financial news. Many buy-side analysts who attend 
analyst calls already have a stake in the company, so they have a vested 
interest in putting a positive spin on the news. If they’re positive, they’ll likely 
revise their earnings estimates upward, which can be the first indication that 
they’ll recommend additional buys and the stock may be getting ready to 
enter an upward trend. This positive spin can give you the first sign of a good 
trading opportunity, so watch your technical analysis for any signals of a 
potential breakout. We discuss more about breakouts in Chapter 10.
Just the facts, ma’am
The best way to judge whether senior management is confident in their 
reporting is determining how quickly they respond to questions. If senior 
managers are confident with their numbers, they respond to questions 
quickly, taking little time to think their responses through. If senior managers 
are unsure of their reports, they’re more likely to take a good deal of time 
checking through their papers to answer even the simplest questions. You 
definitely need to think twice about buying or holding stock in a company 
whose management shows a lack of confidence in reporting their numbers.
The future
You’re likely to get a good reading about how senior managers view the 
company’s future prospects by listening to their vision for the company and 
whether the results actually demonstrate that they are fulfilling that vision. 
When managers are successfully fulfilling their vision, they clearly articulate 
their view of the company’s future and how they plan to get there. Ask 
yourself whether management inspires you with its vision. If not, managers 
most likely are not inspiring their employees, which can be an early sign that 
the company is heading on a downward trend.
Employee satisfaction
Happy employees are a good sign that a company will be able to meet its 
future expectations. If, during the call, you hear that the company is having 
trouble attracting new employees or retaining its existing staff, you may be 
looking at a sign of trouble on the horizon. High employee turnover is bad 
for future growth, and so is having trouble finding and recruiting qualified 
employees.
 
Analyst conference calls are best used as a research tool and not for taking 
an immediate action based solely on the information you gather from them. 
Consider them just one more way of gaining more knowledge about a stock 
you’re thinking about buying, or of tracking stocks after you’ve already bought 
them. Day traders and swing traders sometimes use the information from 
analyst calls to trade after hours, but such trades can be highly risky. We talk 
more about these two trading strategies in Chapters 16 and 17.

121
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
Locating Company Calls
Many companies list information about their upcoming earnings reports and 
analyst calls on their company Web sites, while others simply post an audio 
version after the event. Some companies offer their investors a service that 
alerts them to upcoming events. If these services are not available for the 
companies you plan to follow, your best way of tracking upcoming calls is 
through one of two online sites: VCall (www.investorcalendar.com) and 
BestCalls (www.bestcalls.com).
VCall is the leading Webcaster for official investor relations events. Many 
but not all companies use its services to run their events online. This Web 
site offers you free access to live and archived corporate communications. In 
addition to the calls, you can find copies of financial information released by 
the company. VCall also enables you to set up e-mail alerts for the companies 
you track that are served by VCall.
BestCalls is the leading resource site for locating earnings conferences on the 
Internet. Although VCall is the leading provider for companies that play host 
to calls, the only company calls that are listed on VCall’s site are for companies 
that use its services. BestCalls, on the other hand, is the largest single source 
for tracking analyst call schedules with links to the location for these calls 
and access to archived calls. Thousands of companies list their conferences 
and analyst calls on this site, and you can set up an e-mail alert for any 
company you want to follow. BestCalls charges membership fees to access 
the entire site and fees for transcripts of older calls. You may be able to find 
a link for free from the investor relations section of a company’s Web site.
Identifying Trends in the Stock 
Analyst Community
A new regulatory climate came to Canada after the Bre-X Minerals scandal 
in 1997, when this massive fraud involved a so-called gold mine with an 
apparent market capitalization of almost $6 billion. As a result, the Toronto 
Stock Exchange had to hire Standard & Poor’s to police the choice of com-
panies for its Composite Index. In the United States, it arrived in the wake 
of abuses exposed when the tech stock bubble of the early 2000s burst. 
Regulations now control the flow of information between companies and 
analysts — and, ultimately, what information makes its way to you as an 
outside investor or trader.

122
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Some traders believe that the new restrictions that ban selective disclosure 
to friendly analysts or key investors actually hurt the flow of information to 
the general public. Regulations require that any information disclosed to 
analysts or key investors that can affect the value of the company must 
be disclosed to the general public within 24 hours, even if the information 
wasn’t part of a planned report.
The preference is for making announcements about material information at 
the same time for everyone, but sometimes during meetings with analysts 
or institutional investors information is shared inadvertently. For example, 
if analysts find out information during a company tour, the company then is 
required to put out a press release disclosing the same information to the 
general public. Some analysts believe this is making the preparation of their 
reports much more difficult than it needs to be.
Newer regulations, however, have halted some commonplace industry 
practices, including closed meetings with analysts and institutional investors. 
Lawyers for many companies warn senior managers to be careful about 
responding to calls from individual analysts. Some companies require that 
any contact with analysts first be evaluated and approved through their legal 
advisers.
Regulations also impact roadshows, which are marketing tours that introduce 
a company’s new securities offerings. The regulators permit these events but 
give clear guidance that they now need to be more like oral offers that are 
designed to avoid the prohibition against written or broadcast offers made 
outside the official prospectus of the offering. American regulators believe 
these roadshows are best conducted in the open to all investors and have 
voiced objections to having two separate roadshows, one for institutional 
investors and another more watered down version for retail investors. Some 
legal experts also advise companies to be careful about whether they include 
outside analysts, those not employed by the underwriter of the offering, 
as part of the roadshow. Including outside analysts, some believe, can be 
viewed as selective disclosure, which violates Regulation FD in the United 
States.
 
The biggest regulatory changes you’ll see as an individual investor or trader 
relate to disclosures that must be made in research reports, including a 
requirement that securities firms must disclose any compensation they 
receive for investment banking services they provide during the three months 
following the public offering for a covered company. In addition, firms that 
are members of some exchanges must disclose when they stop coverage 
of a public company. Many times this type of news generates unfavourable 
publicity for the company and can result in a drop in stock prices. In addition 
to these big disclosures, analysts’ research reports now must include 
information about the relationships among the analysts, underwriters, and 
stock issuer.

123
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
One international investment firm has to provide such a large array of 
disclosures due to its global presence that it needs four pages of type in a 
font smaller than the one you are reading now. Often the research disclosure 
is longer than the research report itself!
Operating in this type of fish bowl may make companies and analysts nervous, 
but it nevertheless should balance the cards for individual investors. Look 
carefully for these disclosures as you read analysts’ reports and take 
advantage of your newfound access to information by attending analysts’ 
earnings conferences and being part of the insider pool rather than a passive 
outsider waiting to be fed information by the financial media or professional 
analysts.

Technical Analysis Work?

E
veryone knows that foretelling the future is a tough thing to do, 
especially when money is involved. Whether your prognosticating tool 
of choice is a Ouija board or a Magic 8 Ball, knowing exactly what the future 
holds is difficult.
Investors and traders are always looking for an edge in forecasting stock 
prices to improve their trading results. The method of choice for many 
investors is fundamental analysis, which we describe in Chapters 5, 6, and 7. 
For some traders, on the other hand, technical analysis, as described here 
and in Chapters 9–11, is the way to go.
Although some overlap exists between fundamental and technical analyses, 
you find dyed-in-the-wool, true believers in both camps, and they argue 
that their way is best, even going so far as to say the opposite way is worse 
than useless. For our money, the truth lies somewhere in between these two 
extremes.
Understanding the Mythology
A technician — that’s someone who reads charts — believes you can use 
price charts and market statistics to develop a profitable trading plan. Some 
technicians even say that price charts foretell where a stock’s price is heading 
simply by showing where it has been. Detractors argue that technical 
analysis is merely another name for fortune telling, a charlatan’s moniker that 
avoids entanglements with local authorities and the securities regulators.

128
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Had Madame Cleo, that deposed temptress of tarot cards, made her living 
foretelling stock prices, she might still be in business. Likewise, had she lived 
in earlier times, she might have been revered by the masses and the high 
priests for her fortune-telling skills instead of being scorned as a fraud.
In ancient Rome, tracking the stars, the planets, and the behaviour of 
birds was popular, and so was inspecting the entrails of sacrificial animals. 
Although a bit gruesome, the haruspex — that’s the expert gut checker — 
was highly regarded. As an augur, an official diviner in ancient Rome, 
Madame Cleo would have been consulted to foretell events and reveal the 
gods’ reactions to any future courses of action. She would have been in the 
limelight and riding as high as she was right before the U.S. Federal Trade 
Commission brought her into check. Although it may have been bogus, 
Madame Cleo couldn’t have hoped for more.
In spite of Madame Cleo’s fate, fortune-tellers still ply their trade. Are the 
most successful the ones who divine future price movements by reading 
the entrails of stock price charts? That’s what a cadre of academic financial 
experts thinks. To the uninitiated, price charts are merely squiggles and 
lines on a page. The academics apparently believe, just like augurs of old, 
that technicians track those squiggles and lines as a means of predicting 
price behaviour and attempting to divine a particular stock’s future course of 
action.
Thankfully, the market entrails viewed by technicians aren’t as gruesome as 
the ones analyzed by the haruspex. Nevertheless, academics and fundamental 
analysts often regard technicians in the same light as haruspices — little more 
than an expert gut checker — but the analogy isn’t really valid. Technical 
analysis is not a forecasting tool. It is a trading tool and nothing more.
There is a tale, no doubt apocryphal, about a technician who approached 
Warren Buffett with some wonderful technical analysis as a sure way to 
beat the market. The “Oracle of Omaha” applied the analysis and came to a 
neutral conclusion. Then he instructed that all the original charts be turned 
upside down and the same analysis applied. The conclusion was the same. 
Buffett’s alleged quotations are: “I realized technical analysis didn’t work 
when I turned the charts upside down and didn’t get a different answer,” and 
“If past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be 
librarians.”
Technical analysis does not turn water into wine. It’s simply a useful tool you 
may choose to use in building your investment skill set.

129
 Chapter 8: Reading the Tea Leaves: Does Technical Analysis Work?
Understanding the Methodology
 
Although technicians try to anticipate the future and make trading plans 
based on price-chart squiggles, technical analysis is a far cry from reading 
tea leaves or tarot cards. Instead of predicting the future, technical analysis 
is used to identify events that are likely to occur, and to make trading plans 
in case they do and alternative plans in case they do not. Technicians use 
a logical framework to identify price trends, turning points, trading ranges, 
and breakouts. These important trading concepts are covered in Chapters 9 
through 11.
 
To understand the technical analyst’s methods, you need to be familiar with 
these technical analysis concepts:
 
✓ Everything is in the price.
 
✓ Price movements are not (always) random.
 
✓ Price changes are caused by an imbalance between supply and demand.
Finding everything in the price
The stock market is so efficient that everything that’s currently known about 
a company is priced into its stock. In other words, the current price reflects 
the combined wisdom of everyone in the market, including corporate insiders, 
pension funds, mutual funds, individual investors, stock analysts, fundamental 
analysts, technicians, publishers, media, regulators, and you.
Technical analysis provides a synopsis of all the fundamental and psychological 
factors that affect the price of a stock. Although we personally think putting 
all your eggs in the price basket is taking the point to an extreme, that’s why 
some technicians don’t even try to evaluate the fundamentals. Why bother 
trying to outsmart the smartest when everything’s in the price?
 
The technician’s understanding of why a stock’s price moves is not important. 
Technicians don’t care whether the price movement was caused by the most 
recent analyst’s report or by the flapping of a butterfly’s wings in China. They 
are concerned only with
 
✓ What is the price now?
 
✓ What is the price history?

130
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Technical analysts examine current prices relative to the histories of price 
movements to understand and plan for what may happen next. Fundamental 
analysts ask why, trying to understand what piece of news causes a particular 
rise in price or what bit of insider knowledge causes a sell off. Technicians 
try to see everything the price represents and base their trades only on what 
they see.
 
You can’t know what causes every ripple in the price continuum. So why try?
Realizing price movements 
are not always random
Sometimes prices move higher. Sometimes they move lower. And sometimes 
prices move back and forth within a tight trading range. When prices move 
higher or lower, we say prices are trending. The trading-range periods 
between trending periods often appear to be random price movements, and 
at times they may actually be random. But when you zoom in to view the 
price movements within those seemingly random trading-range periods, you 
will find the trading range is made up of many mini trends. The closer you 
look, the less random these price movements appear, and that is the crux of 
technical analysis. These are important concepts for trading and are covered 
more fully in Chapter 10.
 
At its simplest, technical analysis identifies the periods of time during which 
trends occur. In general, technicians want to base their trades on trending 
markets. The idea is determining when trends are beginning and when they’re 
ending. But which trend? Are you the type of trader who is interested in the 
little mini trends that make up a trading range? Or are you most interested in 
trading longer-lasting trends?
The trick to technical trading, therefore, is identifying a stock’s price trend 
within the time frame during which you want to buy or sell it. Depending on 
the length of time you plan to hold the stock, you want to base your trades on 
analyses done in the corresponding time frame. We are primarily concerned 
with long-lasting trends that span many weeks or months. In that case, you’ll 
want to analyze charts showing daily and weekly prices. If, instead, you 
plan to hold your stock for no more than a few hours or a few days, you’ll 
want to analyze charts showing intraday prices. When looking at intraday 
price charts, you will see many examples of mini trends and trading ranges. 
However, if you’re buying a stock and holding your position for weeks or 
months, those mini intraday trends and trading ranges are meaningless. We 
discuss these concepts more fully in Chapter 9.

 Chapter 8: Reading the Tea Leaves: Does Technical Analysis Work?
Balancing supply and demand
If you’ve ever watched the nightly business news, you’ve probably heard 
reporters claim that stocks rose because more buyers were looking for 
stocks than sellers were willing to part with them. At some level, that’s 
hogwash. Even novice investors realize that every trade must have a buyer 
and a seller.
What the reporter really means is that the supply and demand were out of 
balance and that price is a function of supply and demand. In macroeconomics, 
this concept is illustrated using a freely traded commodity like wheat. When 
farmers grow more wheat than bakers need, the price of wheat falls. When 
bakers need more wheat than farmers grew, bakers bid higher prices to get 
the wheat they need.
 
In many ways, the price of a stock works just like the price of wheat. When 
buyers want to buy more shares of a stock than sellers are willing or able to 
sell, buyers bid the stock price higher until they find sellers willing to part 
with their shares. Conversely, when sellers can’t find enough buyers, they 
offer their shares at lower and lower prices until enough buyers can be found.
Changes in a company’s business plan, a new competitor, anything really, 
can throw the balance between supply and demand out of whack. Realizing 
that imbalances cause prices to move — and not the news itself — is the 
point where technical analysis is concerned.
Understanding where you’ve been
Technicians examine price history, trading volume, and additional market 
statistics to evaluate the balance between supply and demand. The conceptual 
framework is easy to understand. As long as prices are rising, demand 
exceeds supply, and buyers are more interested in buying than sellers are in 
selling. The reverse is equally true. When prices are falling, supply exceeds 
demand, and sellers are more interested in selling than buyers are in buying. 
When a stock trades within a tight range of prices, a balance between supply 
and demand has been achieved. This situation is evident on the price chart 
when a stock trades within a trading range. Examples are shown in Chapter 9.
 
Technical analysis helps identify these kinds of scenarios. Technicians 
examine charts in search of the price levels where buying pressure stops a 
stock’s price from falling further or where selling pressure squashes a rally.

132
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Here’s a hypothetical scenario to illustrate that point. A high-profile investment 
adviser issues a recommendation to buy shares of XYZ, which closed at 
$18.50 the day before and has traded in a tight price range of $17 to $18.75 
during the past four months. The recommendation to buy is in effect only if 
the stock trades for less than $19 a share. The idea is not necessarily to buy 
the instant that a recommendation is made, but rather to buy at a good price.
Taking the hypothetical example a step further, say that the investment 
adviser has a wide following. Invariably, the recommendation is quickly 
followed by a surge in the volume of buyers purchasing shares of XYZ that 
ultimately pushes the price of the stock to $21.
Buying surges based on these kinds of recommendations have a tendency to 
stall out and return to the buy-under price (in this case $19) after all the early 
buyers make their trades. Patient subscribers of this adviser have seen this 
movie many times before, so they wait for a pullback, and place a limit order 
near the $19 price. (We discuss limit orders in Chapter 2.) Enough patient 
subscribers usually are in the market for the stock to keep its price from 
falling further.
Now imagine you’re watching this stock without knowledge of the investment 
adviser’s recommendation. The steps that you’d likely see the price of XYZ 
shares take during the course of a week or two include:
 
1. XYZ breaking out of its trading range and rallying on high volume
 
2. XYZ pulling back on low volume
 
3. High-volume buying of XYZ resuming as the price falls near $19
This type of market activity is what technicians wait for. You will see this 
scenario play out over and over again, both in individual stocks, in exchange-
traded funds, and in the general market indexes. Chapter 9 covers this 
technique in more detail, but for now, know that it is a textbook example of a 
trading-range breakout defined by the following:
 
✓ A high-volume breakout after a long period of range-bound trading
 
✓ A low-volume pullback
 
✓ High-volume rally to new highs
If you were interested in this stock, you may have taken a position. In fact, given 
this setup, the three logical places where a technician takes a position are
 
✓ At the breakout: Buy as soon as the stock trades through the resistance 
at the upper end of the trading range.
 
✓ At the pullback: Buy immediately as the stock begins trading higher 
after the low-volume pullback.

133
 Chapter 8: Reading the Tea Leaves: Does Technical Analysis Work?
 
✓ At the double top: When the stock retraces the move from the pullback 
to its high price, it’s called a double top. Buy when the stock makes a 
new high for the move.
Of these three alternatives, our favourite is the middle one, because buying 
at the pullback is a relatively low-risk, high-reward trade. Our least favourite 
alternative is the last one, trading the double top as the stock makes a 
new high, because it is the riskiest of the three. Both the breakout and the 
pullback trades are covered in much more detail, including example charts, 
in Chapter 9.
As long as technical analysis helps you get a good entry price on your trade 
and keep your losses small, you’ll have a powerful trading tool at your disposal.
Understanding where you’re headed
 
Technical analysis helps you find out where in the ups and downs of the 
market buyers took action in the past. If you have a hint where buyers have 
stepped in before, you can reasonably expect that they will do so again in the 
future. When they do as you expect, you need to be able to trade on that 
information profitably.
If they don’t do as you expect, you may have to bust your trade, and yet 
you’ve still discovered a great deal of valuable information. You hope that 
the price you pay for that knowledge isn’t too great, but you nevertheless 
know more than you did before. You know that the last wave of buying 
exhausts demand, and thus you need to begin looking for further evidence of 
a reversal.
You don’t have to adhere to arguments that technical analysis is a good 
forecasting tool merely to recognize that it’s a useful trading tool. If you 
combine technical analysis with some fundamental analysis, you can soon 
get to the point where you see the merits of both disciplines.
Answering the Detractors
A few arguments against technical analysis actually make some sense, but 
an entire category of lame complaints also exists. For example, some people 
argue that no technicians have been successful over the long run and that no 
technician has mustered the stature or success of illustrious market moguls 
like Sir John Templeton, Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham, Peter Lynch, or 
Peter Cundill.

134
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
As if to further this argument, they point to some infamous technician who 
blew up his portfolio in spectacular fashion. Then a few years later, they harp 
on another well-known technician who made a boneheaded call, and then it 
happened again, and therefore technical analysis is useless.
The impulse to counter these arguments with a list of high-profile fundamental 
analysts who also blew client portfolios, however, is misguided. Even a litany 
of disasters wouldn’t disprove the usefulness of fundamental analysis any 
more than a list of high-profile successes proves that fundamental analysis is 
the only way to make money in stocks. Why, then, should anyone accept that 
either proves technical analysis is useless?
In fact, many successful technicians have long, profitable trading careers. 
Canadian technicians worthy of mention include Don Vialoux, Skot Kortje, 
and Donald Dony, MFTA (Canada’s first master of financial technical analysis). 
Although most technicians toil in self-imposed obscurity, some are prominent 
and outspoken. For example, John W. Henry, who owns the Boston Red Sox, 
made his fortune as a trend-following technician, but missed the mark in the 
volatility of the market in 2006 and 2007 so he lost most of his clients. 
Additional examples include Ed Seykota, a trader with 35 years’ experience 
and one of the original Market Wizards, and Bill Dunn of Dunn Capital 
Management Inc. This is just a tiny sample of the many successful independent 
traders and fund managers who employ technical analysis tools to make 
trading decisions. But they do not always read the tea leaves correctly, as we 
saw with John W. Henry. It’s an art — not an exact science.
A related argument about a chart-reading challenge that no technician has 
ever attempted (or would even consider) works like this: The technical analyst 
is given one half of a price chart with all identifying information removed. 
From that information, the technician is supposed to tell whether the stock’s 
price was higher or lower at any point in the second half of the chart.
Of course, nobody ever claims the prize for having accomplished this feat, 
and that, therefore, is supposed to be proof that no technician ever has 
enough confidence in technical analysis to even try. Accomplished technicians 
aren’t any better at telling the future than a haruspex or tarot-card reader — 
and neither, for that matter, are fundamental analysts. Technical analysis is 
not fortune telling, it’s simply a trading tool.
Walking randomly
 
The random walk theory has nothing to do with hiking without a map, but 
instead is an academic theory that says stock prices are completely random. 
What happened to a stock yesterday has nothing to do with what happens to 
its price tomorrow.

135
 Chapter 8: Reading the Tea Leaves: Does Technical Analysis Work?
Furthermore, this theory claims that the market is so efficient that consistently 
outperforming broad-based market indexes is impossible. In other words, 
any edge that you may gain from fundamental analysis, technical analysis, or 
tea leaves is useless and expensive. After all, transaction costs far outweigh 
any performance improvement that your analysis provides.
Armed with computer models and reams of study results, academic experts 
cling to these efficient-market hypotheses as gospel. Several challenges 
oppose their argument. No less an authority than the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York published a study showing that using support and resistance levels 
(see Chapter 9) improved trading results for several firms. Additionally, 
articles published in the Journal of Finance suggest that trading based on 
moving averages and head and shoulder reversal patterns outperformed the 
market averages. (We discuss reversal patterns in Chapter 9, and moving 
averages in Chapter 11.)
 
So do you think this is proof that technical analysis is effective all the time? Of 
course not. But it casts doubt about the validity of the random walk theory, 
especially the part that technical analysis cannot be used to consistently 
improve results compared to the market averages.
A more recent theory comes from Leonard Mlodinow in his best-selling 
book The Drunkard’s Walk. The author discusses the random nature of most 
financial data, which resemble the unpredictable steps of a drunk.
Debating these arguments to a logical conclusion is nearly impossible. Even 
when you use technical analysis successfully, random walkers claim your 
performance is the result of random chance — nothing more than good luck. 
Don’t believe them. Instead, believe that luck favours the prepared mind.
Watching trading signals known to all
Anyone who cares to look can see exactly the same patterns and has access 
to the same indicators as every other trader. There is nothing new under the 
sun — or in the markets.
Although some traders create proprietary indicators to gain a trading edge, 
many more use well-known off-the-shelf trading tools. The patterns and 
indicators described in Chapters 9, 10, and 11 are all well known. Some are 
freely available on the Internet for anyone to use. Thus, if everyone sees the 
same thing, how can you use those trading signals profitably? The question is 
perfectly legitimate.

136
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Although everyone sees the same patterns and the same indicators, this 
equality is a strength rather than a weakness. Technical analysis gives you 
insight into what future actions you can expect from your fellow market 
participants. With practice, you can use that information to construct a 
consistently profitable trading plan.
 
After you become familiar with traditional patterns and indicators, you can 
incorporate your experience and market knowledge into your trading plans 
and thus come to an understanding about when to use specific tools and when 
results are meaningless. From these plans, you can find out when a trading 
signal works and when it fails. You can make trades based on indicators and 
patterns that help and ignore the rest.
Many widely known indicators and trading patterns exist, but we personally 
use only a handful of the simplest ones. Your results will differ from ours. 
You may trade in a different time frame than we do, or you may choose a 
different set of tools altogether. As long as your tools improve your trading, 
continue using them.
Telling Fortunes or Planning Trades?
Cutting to the chase, you probably guessed by now that you’re never going 
to foretell the future with technical analysis. Technical analysis, instead, is 
simply a useful trading tool.
 
Successful trading does not mean that you have to be right all the time or 
even half the time. You don’t have to tell the future. Technical analysis is an 
excellent tool for managing your money, controlling your losses, and enabling 
your profits to run (see Chapter 12 for more money management information).
Even people who base their trades on fundamental factors can use chart 
analysis to help them time market entry and exit points and gauge price 
volatility and risk. Using technical analysis successfully means
 
✓ Being patient
 
✓ Finding out how to identify and use a small number of patterns and 
indicators
 
✓ Becoming proficient at finding these patterns and profitably trading on 
them
 
✓ Adding methodically to your tool kit to improve your trading results
Remember that no method is foolproof. Nothing ensures successful trades 
100 percent of the time. But technical analysis is an excellent tool for 
improving your trading results.

Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
In This Chapter
▶ Creating a bar chart
▶ Deciphering simple visual patterns
▶ Distinguishing between trends and trading ranges
▶ Pinpointing transitions from trading range to trend
S
tock charts come in many flavours. Some prominent ones include 
point-and-figure charts, candlestick charts, and the ever-popular bar 
charts, which we use throughout this book.
Bar charts are easy to create, interpret, and maintain. Furthermore, charting 
tools and analysis techniques for bar charts apply to stocks, bonds, options, 
indexes, and futures, and are applicable across any time frame in which you 
may want to trade. In addition, most chart patterns work for long (buy first, 
sell later) and short (sell first, buy later) trades.
This chapter shows you how to draw price charts for a single stock, for 
an index such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index or the S&P 500, or for an 
exchange-traded fund, and recognize simple single-day trading patterns. In 
addition, you find out how to identify trends and trading ranges and how to 
look for key transition points that often lead to good trading opportunities. 
Charting is a visual methodology, so you’ll find many example charts used 
throughout this chapter. Examine them carefully. You’ll want to quickly identify 
the patterns we describe here when evaluating charts for your own trading.
Creating a Price Chart
Traders used to create their charts by hand. Today, however, many charting 
alternatives and options are available, including easy-to-use computer 
software and easily accessible Internet sites, both of which are discussed 
in Chapter 4. You may, of course, still want to create charts by hand; that’s 
something we encourage you to do — at least for a little while. Making your 
own charts is easy, a great way to discover charting concepts, and an 
excellent way of getting a feel for the markets.

138
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
A chart of stock prices shares characteristics with other charts with which 
you’re probably familiar. These kinds of charts typically are made up of two 
axes; the horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents 
price. One unusual feature of a stock chart is that its vertical axis, the price 
axis, usually is shown on the right, as in Figure 9-1. The most current prices 
are shown on the right-hand side of the chart, and so are the newest trading 
signals. You always trade while those signals are on the right edge of a chart, 
so having the price axis closest to the most crucial part of the chart makes 
sense.

Creating a single price bar
Regardless of whether your chart is an intraday chart (showing fluctuations 
throughout a trading day) or a chart of daily or weekly prices, the format of 
the price bar is the same. Each bar represents the results for a single trading 
period. On a chart that provides daily information, for example, each bar 
represents the results for a single trading day.
Most stock-price bar charts show four important prices on each bar:
 
✓ Open: The price recorded for the first trade
 
✓ High: The highest price trade during the trading period

139
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
 
✓ Low: The lowest price trade during the trading period
 
✓ Close: The price recorded for the last trade
By convention, a daily bar chart shows trades for the Toronto Stock 
Exchange (TSX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) trading day — 
from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET — but some charting packages include optional 
after-hours results (prices from trades that occur after the market closes) as 
part of each daily bar. Likewise, some charting packages omit the opening 
prices on intraday charts. The opening price on an intraday chart (almost) 
always is the same as the closing price for the previous bar, so omitting it is 
of little consequence. However, omitting the opening price on daily, weekly, 
and monthly charts diminishes the usefulness of the chart, so avoid charts 
that don’t provide all four prices.
Figure 9-2 shows a single price bar. The full range of prices traded throughout 
the period is shown by the vertical bar. The opening price is shown as a 
small line on the left-hand side of the bar, and the closing price is shown by a 
similar line on the right-hand side of the bar.
 
Figure 9-2: 
A single 
price bar.
 
High
Close
Open
Low
This identical format is used for all time periods. For example, an intraday 
chart may use 1-minute bars, where each bar spans all the prices for your 
stock that occur during trades over a full minute. Common time frames for 
stock price charts are
 
✓ 1-minute bars: Each bar represents one minute of trading.
 
✓ 5-minute bars: Each bar represents five minutes of trading.
 
✓ 10-minute bars: Each bar represents ten minutes of trading.
 
✓ 15-minute bars: Each bar represents 15 minutes of trading.
 
✓ 60-minute bars: Each bar represents 60 minutes of trading.

140
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
 
✓ Daily bars: Each bar represents one full day of trading.
 
✓ Weekly bars: Each bar represents one week of trading.
 
✓ Monthly bars: Each bar represents one full month of trading.
In our own trading, we typically monitor weekly charts, daily charts, one 
or two intraday charts, and either 60-minute bars for stocks and exchange-
traded funds or 5-minute bars for indexes. We cover our chart selection and 
methodology more fully in Chapter 13.
Measuring volume
In addition to prices, bar charts often show the volume, or the number of 
shares traded during the given time period represented by each bar. On a 
daily chart, trading volume shows the total number of shares traded 
throughout the day. By convention, the volume is shown as a separate bar 
graph and usually is shown directly underneath the price chart. Figure 9-3 
shows an example.
 
Volume (the number of shares sold) is used as a confirming indicator. In other 
words, if a price bar shows bullish activity (which is discussed later in the 
section on “Identifying Simple Single-Day Patterns”), that bullishness is 
confirmed by a higher-than-average trading volume. However, that bullish 
indication may diminish if trading volume is lower than average.
Volume also is used to gauge institutional participation in a stock. Significant 
trading volume often signals that large institutional investors — mutual 
funds, billionaires, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, and 
others — are placing orders to buy or sell a stock. When prices rise and 
volume is strong, you usually can infer that institutions are accumulating 
positions in the stock. The reverse also is true. When prices fall and trading 
volume is high, large institutions may be liquidating positions, which is 
considered a bearish development.
Low-volume price changes are less meaningful, at least from a technical 
perspective, than high-volume changes. That’s why technicians say, “Volume 
confirms price.”

Colouring charts
Displaying price and volume bars in colour is common on charts. When using 
colour, be sure to use contrasting colours so you can distinguish up days 
from down days. One prominent charting package, for example, defaults to 
green for up days and red for down days. A prominent Internet site defaults 
to black for up days and red for down. Most charting services enable you to 
configure colours to suit yourself.
Identifying Simple Single-Day Patterns
The goal of chart reading is determining whether buyers or sellers are in 
control of the price. In a bull market, shareholders may be willing to sell, but 
only if they can coax higher prices from buyers. In a bear market, buyers 
are able to negotiate a better price when sellers are more eager to sell than 
buyers are to buy.

142
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
 
You’re trying to infer the market’s underlying psychology by looking at the 
history of price movements. Inferring that as prices rise, buyers are more 
interested in buying than sellers are in selling is a fair observation. In a rising 
market, buyers must continue bidding prices higher to convince sellers to part 
with their shares. Rising prices attract additional buyers, who must continue 
to bid prices higher to convince even more reluctant sellers to part with their 
shares.
Single-bar patterns
The most bullish thing that a market can do is go higher. Although technicians 
typically view each bar within the context of its neighbouring bars, each 
individual bar has something to tell the careful observer. Figure 9-4, for 
example, shows a bullish single-bar pattern.
 
Figure 9-4: 
A single 
bullish bar.
 
12
11
10
In the example in the figure, buyers bid prices higher throughout the day. 
The opening price of $10 also is the lowest trade for the day. The daily range 
shown on the bar is $2, and the stock closed at $12, the high for the day.
If you’re keeping score (and as a trader, believe us, you are), the bulls gained 
ground and clearly are ahead for the day. Bears holding short positions 
were hurt where it hurts the most — in their pocketbooks. A trader takes a 
short position by borrowing shares of stock and selling them in the hope of 
making money if the stock price falls. This trade loses money if the stock’s 
price rises. The mechanics of selling short are described in Chapter 14. The 
example in Figure 9-4 shows the stock opening at the extreme low and closing 
at its extreme high, but the pattern nevertheless is just as bullish when the 
stock opens near its low and then closes near its high.
Figure 9-5 shows a bearish single-bar pattern. The stock opened at $11.75; 
traded to $12, the high for the day; fell to $10, the daily low; and then closed 
at $10.25. The stock doesn’t have to close at the low for the day for it to be 
bearish. Closing near the low is good enough.

143

These single-day patterns are helpful to the trader who’s trying to understand 
the underpinnings of the markets. Whether these patterns present a trading 
opportunity depends on the stock’s recent history and whether its trading 
volume confirms the pattern (see the earlier section on “Measuring volume”). 
We give you several examples later in this chapter in the section “Searching 
for Transitions,” where a bullish single-bar pattern triggers a buy signal.
Reversal patterns
A reversal bar is another single-bar pattern that shows a stock opening and 
closing at the same end of its trading range. Figure 9-6 shows a bullish single-
bar reversal where the stock opens at the high, trades lower through part 
of the day, and by the close, the stock regains all its losses and closes at its 
highest intraday price.
 
Figure 9-6: 
A bullish 
reversal 
pattern.
 
12

10
During the early part of the trading sessions depicted in the bullish reversal 
pattern, buyers were willing to buy only if sellers lowered their offering 
(asking) prices. By the end of the day, the tide had turned and roles were 

144
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
reversed, with sellers willing to sell but only at higher prices. This situation is 
another win for the bulls, because they were able to stop the price slide and 
recover all the intraday losses.
Figure 9-7 shows a bearish reversal pattern. In this case, the stock opens at 
$10.25, rallies during the day to $12, but closes at the $10 low.
 
Figure 9-7: 
A bearish 
reversal 
pattern.
 
12

10
 
Reversal patterns often represent a powerful single-bar trading pattern. 
Whenever a bullish reversal bar is preceded by several periods of falling 
prices, for example, its pattern often represents a buying opportunity. On the 
other hand, when a bearish reversal bar is preceded by a rising trend, it may 
be a signal to close a long position or initiate a short position. We describe 
selling short in Chapter 14.
Not all price bars, however, present specific trading opportunities. Some 
bars are neutral by themselves, but add to a stock’s history when viewed 
in context. Through charts, you can use a stock’s visual historical record to 
develop your trading plan, as you’ll see in the following sections.
Identifying Trends and Trading Ranges
Technical analysis helps you identify trends, discovering when one begins 
and ends. Our style of trading, position trading, looks for the persistent trend, 
a trend that lasts for at least several weeks to several months, perhaps even 
longer. Day traders and swing traders who buy and sell in the shortest of terms 
also look for trends to trade. In fact, the distinction between a day trader, 
a swing trader, and a position trader is the length of the trend that each is 
hoping to find. Swing trading and day trading are discussed in Chapters 16 
and 17, respectively. If you’re really interested, check out Swing Trading For 
Dummies by Omar Bassal and Day Trading For Dummies by Ann C. Logue 
(both published by Wiley).

145
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
 
Following trends is an effective trading strategy, especially for new traders. To 
follow trends successfully, you first need to identify and distinguish between 
stocks and markets exhibiting trends and their counterparts, trading within 
specific price ranges.
Identifying a trading range
Stocks are either trending up or down or trading within a confined price 
range. The latter are said to be range bound or stuck in a trading range, never 
trading higher than the high nor lower than the low during a specific time 
frame. You also hear range-bound stocks described as consolidating or 
building a base. Although some subtle distinctions may exist among these 
terms, we nevertheless use them interchangeably.
In general, we’re not interested in trading range-bound stocks. Trading 
ranges can persist for long periods of time. Some may even last for years. For 
a position trader, having money in a range-bound stock represents wasted 
opportunity. You won’t lose money, but you won’t make any either. Instead, 
we are interested in identifying range-bound stocks because they have the 
potential to begin trending. We patiently watch these stocks for a signal 
indicating the trading range may end and a trend may begin. Stocks that 
break out of a long-lasting trading range often begin trends that can be traded 
profitably.
Trading ranges are easy to spot after the fact, but anticipating when a stock 
is about to enter or exit a trading range is nearly impossible. For this and 
other reasons, range-bound stocks are difficult to trade, especially for new 
traders. Some short-term traders are able to trade range-bound stocks 
successfully, so it isn’t impossible, but we encourage you first to become 
a proficient trend trader before attempting to trade stocks stuck in trading 
ranges. We describe tools you can use in trading-range situations in Chapter 
11. In Chapter 10, we discuss what to do if a stock you own stops trending 
and becomes range bound.
Identifying a trading range is best done visually. Figure 9-8 shows a chart of 
Time Warner Inc. (TWX) stock in a range-bound pattern.
Time Warner spent more than nine months trading between $13.50 and 
$16.50. Notice how the price moves up and down but always between those 
levels, never making much progress one way or the other. Also notice the 
lines drawn on the chart near $13.50 and $16.50. These lines show support 
and resistance levels, respectively, and are discussed in the “Support and 
resistance: Not just for undergarments” section later in this chapter.

Spotting a trend
Now contrast the Time Warner chart in Figure 9-8 with the chart of Ryanair 
Holdings (RYAAY) in Figure 9-9. RYAAY appears quite different from the 
range-bound stock. Notice the steady stair-step march upward as the stock 
rises higher and higher.

PLC stock

Even in a strong upward trend, stocks rarely go straight up. You often see 
some reversals and mini-consolidations in a trend that cause the stair-
stepped look.

147
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
 
That stair-stepped upward march is an identifying characteristic of an uptrend. 
Although defining it quantitatively is possible, seeing an uptrend on a chart is 
easy and that’s the way it often is done. As long as a stock price continues to 
reach higher intermittent highs, and its new lows don’t fall below previous 
lows, the uptrend remains intact. Chapter 10 discusses trends and these 
stair-step patterns in more detail.
Stocks can also downtrend; a series of lower highs and lower lows is as much 
of a trend as its upward-bound counterpart. See Figure 9-10, a chart showing 
Comerica Inc. in a downtrend.
 
Figure 9-10: 
Comerica’s 
stock in a

Time frame matters
The time frame of your chart determines your trading perspective.
You may notice that the price lines of a range-bound stock are made up of 
many small trends. If you look at an intraday chart of Time Warner stock 
(TWX) that spanned the 25 or so days of trading from April 14, 2008, through 
May 15, 2008, TWX appears to be in an uptrend.
In fact, TWX was in a trend during that period. However, when you step back 
and observe a broader historical record of TWX’s trading pattern by looking 
at the daily and weekly charts, you can easily see that the multi-day trend 
actually was confined within the prevailing trading range.
Although short-term swing traders and day traders make a living basing their 
trading on these mini- and microtrends, doing so isn’t our cup of tea. We 
caution you that consistently trading range-bound stocks profitably is very 
difficult to do.

148
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Searching for Transitions
A stock can transition from a downtrend to an uptrend in several different ways. 
It can, for example, fall precipitously, turn on a dime, and begin heading higher. 
Furthermore, a stock can fall, bounce around in a trading range for a while, and 
begin a new trend — up or down — as it breaks from the trading range.
Although turning on a dime from downtrending to uptrending sometimes 
presents profitable trading opportunities, these transitions are difficult to 
identify, and are even more difficult to base a trade on. Additional tools of 
technical analysis to unearth these transitions are explained in Chapters 10 
and 11. Rather than trying to score big on sharp transitions, we recommend 
searching for stocks making the transition to trending after a period of 
range-bound trading lasting at least six to eight weeks, preferably longer.
Support and resistance: Not just 
for undergarments
The transition from range-bound to trending is relatively easy to identify 
visually and is the easiest to trade profitably. To find the transition, you must 
be familiar with the concept of support and resistance. You will see support 
and resistance used in many contexts. For example, they are used to identify 
a trading range, as discussed in this section. They are also used to help 
identify when a trend has reached its end, as we discuss in Chapter 10.
For an example of how support and resistance levels are shown on a chart, 
refer to Figure 9-8, the chart showing TWX stuck in a trading range. The 
support line shown on this chart is at approximately $13.50; the resistance 
line is shown near $16.50.
 
Support is always the lower trading-range boundary; resistance is always the 
upper trading-range boundary.
When technicians talk about support, they mean the price where buyers are 
willing to buy enough stock to stop the price from falling. Said another way, 
when sellers see enough buying interest at the support price, they may still 
be willing to sell, but, as for now, they’ll sell only if they can coax buyers to 
raise their bids. Buyers are now eager to buy, so they’re willing to bid a little 
more to complete the transaction. The result: Prices end their descent and 
begin heading higher.
The reverse is true as the stock price approaches the resistance level. Buyers 
begin losing interest as the stock reaches elevated prices. Eager sellers must 
lower their offer (asking) price to complete the transaction, which causes 
prices to stop rising and begin falling.

149
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
 
Support levels and resistance levels often are determined visually by means of 
a chart. Knowing the exact price where lines of support and resistance need to 
be drawn is difficult, and traders may differ on where to draw these lines. Some 
choose the extreme, plotting intraday highs and lows of a trading range during 
a specific time frame to establish those levels. We prefer using closing prices 
on a daily or weekly bar chart to define the upper and lower boundaries within 
the trading range. If you’re analyzing an intraday chart, use the last trade price 
on each bar when drawing the support and resistance levels. In our opinion, 
closing prices (or last prices) have more significance and better represent the 
consensus of traders and investors. Ultimately, the choice is yours.
 
Technical analysis is not an exact science. And as such, thinking of support 
and resistance levels as areas of support or zones of resistance is probably 
better than viewing them in terms of specific prices or single lines on a chart, 
even though that’s how they appear.
Finding a breakout
A stock remains stuck in its trading range as long as it bounces between 
zones of support and resistance. Short-term traders may be interested in 
these movements, but as a position trader you’re looking for a more 
substantial trend, so you must wait for something to change the status quo 
and cause the stock to break out of its trading range.
 
A breakout sometimes signals the transition of a stock trading within a range 
to a new uptrend or downtrend. When breaking out to the upside, we want to 
see the resistance zone violated by a significant amount, certainly by more 
than 5 or 10 cents. More important, we want to see the stock trade through 
its resistance zone on much higher volume than the average. Ideally, volume 
needs to be at least 50 percent higher than average. More volume is even 
better. Remember that volume confirms price.
Figure 9-11 shows a chart of Baxter International Inc. (BAX), a textbook 
example of a stock breaking out of a trading range. BAX had been trading 
within a narrow range from mid 2005 through June 2006. We drew the 
support line just above $34.50 and the resistance line near $38.00. The 
support and resistance levels were tested several times in 2006.
On July 20, 2006, BAX opened well above its previous close, traded through 
the zone of resistance, and closed at $38.88. This pattern — where a stock’s 
opening price is well above its previous close and moves up, breaking out of 
its trading range — is called a breakout gap, which we discuss more fully in 
Chapter 10. Although not a requirement for a stock to break out of its trading 
range, a breakout gap does bolster the case for this rise in prices to be a 
transition from trading within a range to a new uptrend. Trading volume 
was almost 8 million shares, or almost triple the average daily volume of 2.7 
million shares.

As the chart shows, BAX continued to trade higher. Although you cannot see 
it in Figure 9-11, BAX continued its rally through May 2007.
The BAX breakout was an almost picture-perfect setup for a trading opportunity. 
Baxter is a leading stock in a leading industry. The stock built a solid trading-
range base and broke out on higher-than-average volume. Then BAX went 
on to rally for almost a year. Nice. We discuss ways to identify when a trend 
has come to an end, and when to close your trade to realize your profits, in 
Chapter 10.
Waiting patiently for winning patterns
We can hear the gears grinding from here. Yes, it’s a nice trade . . . but you’re 
probably saying to yourself, “Couldn’t I have bought BAX for about $35.00 
several times between February 2006 and June 2006? Why wait until the 
breakout drives my entry price up?”
 
The answer: Finding a good trading signal is important; avoiding bad trading 
signals is more important.
Foretelling the future is hard. Of course hindsight is going to tell you that 
buying BAX at $35.00 would’ve earned you more money than buying it above 
$38. But when the price was $35.00, how could you know that BAX wouldn’t 
stay in its trading range for many more months or years? Or how could you 
tell that BAX wasn’t going to break out of its trading range to the downside, 
and start trending lower?

151
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
It happens. In fact, if the stock had traded below its zone of support, 
technical analysis would’ve suggested a potential opportunity to sell BAX 
short.
Another important reason for waiting for a breakout is that when you enter 
a trade, you need an exit strategy. Exit strategies are discussed more fully in 
Chapters 12 through 14, but for now, know that you need technical signals to 
show you when to exit your position, the same way you needed them to enter 
the position in the first place. If you’re trying to buy stocks at the bottom and 
then sell them at the top, few signals are available to tell you whether your 
entry signal has failed.
Fine-tuning your trading-range breakout strategy
Three ways you can fine-tune your trading-range breakout strategy are by
 
✓ Observing that breakouts from long trading ranges tend to result in 
more profitable buying and selling than breakouts from shorter trading 
ranges.
 
✓ Understanding that breakouts from tight trading ranges, where price 
fluctuations are confined to a relatively narrow price range, usually 
result in better trades than when trading-range price fluctuations are 
wide.
 
✓ Waiting for a short while — at least one day, possibly two or three — 
to confirm the trading range breakout can be helpful. Waiting to see 
whether the stock falls back into the trading range before you take a 
position can save you from a negative market reaction. Running into a 
wave of selling immediately after a breakout is not uncommon, and the 
way the stock reacts to that selling is just as important as the breakout 
itself.
 
Consistently snagging the lowest price is nearly impossible, regardless of 
whether you use technical analysis, fundamental analysis, a Ouija board, 
Madame Cleo, or follow the best prognosticators in the business. Technical 
analysis can help you find transitions, but it can’t tell the future. As a technician, 
you never (almost never) buy your stocks at their lowest prices, and you 
rarely exit your positions at the highest prices.
 
However, if you wait for a solid trading signal, you can ride the middle part 
of the trend for a large portion of the move. Try not to be greedy. The middle 
part of the trend is a very profitable place to trade.
Sipping from a cup and saucer
Another widely followed transitional formation is called a cup and handle. 
In a cup and handle formation, a stock’s price levels form a rounded curving 
bottom that looks a bit like a cup or a saucer, which often is followed by a 

152
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
modest shakeout formation that, if you use your imagination, looks a bit like 
the handle on a coffee cup.
Figure 9-12 shows a chart of the Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock that illustrates the 
cup and handle formation.
 
Figure 9-12: 
Apple Inc. 
stock prices

and handle 
pattern.
 
Resistance
Breakout
Breakout Gap

Cup

Higher than Average Breakout Volume
The entry strategy for this pattern is similar to that used for the trading range 
breakout. The trigger occurs when the stock price breaks above the handle 
on high volume. In the Apple example, it occurs in late April, and is accompanied 
by a small breakout gap.
Notice that the stock traded in a very narrow range during the next couple of 
days, retesting the former area of resistance. As often is the case, that former 
resistance level actually provided support after it was crossed. You’ll see this 
phenomenon occur frequently.
The cup and handle is a reliable trading pattern, but that doesn’t mean the 
pattern never fails. It does, and you need an exit strategy for when it does, 
just like every other trade. We discuss exit strategies in Chapter 12.

153
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
Deciding what to do with a double bottom
Another transition pattern that often leads to profitable trading opportunities 
is the double bottom. Visually, a double bottom looks like a “W” on the chart, 
so it is very easy to see. However, a double bottom doesn’t need to form a 
perfect “W” to be valid. In fact, we actually prefer the right-hand trough to be 
a little lower than the left-hand trough. When a minor new low forms, it tends 
to shake out the weakest owners of the stock and makes it much easier for 
bulls to drive the price higher.
Figure 9-13 shows a well-formed double bottom on the Newmont Mining 
Corp. (NEM) stock chart. The left-hand trough occurred in June 2007; the 
right-hand trough in August 2007.

Higher than Average Breakout Volume
The entry criteria for this pattern are similar to that of the trading-range 
breakout. In this case, the trigger point occurs when the stock breaks above 
the mid-point peak between the two troughs. This peak is sometimes called 
the pivot point. Ideally, higher-than-average volume confirms the trigger.

154
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
The trigger price on the chart is just below $43.00, which corresponds to 
the $42.91 close on July 24. The stock gapped above the trigger point on 
September 6 with a volume of more than 15 million shares. That’s 50 percent 
more than the average daily trading volume.
Also notice the bullish single-day bar pattern on the breakout. The stock 
pulled back to test resistance at the mid-point close price and then rallied.
An alternative double-bottom strategy
One scenario where aggressive traders may want to anticipate the formation 
of a double-bottom pattern is when the “W” is particularly deep and the pivot 
is many points away from the trough. When that happens, taking a position 
as the stock is forming the right-hand trough sometimes makes sense.
If the price holds near or just below the left-hand trough, and volume confirms 
the reversal, then aggressive traders can enter a position. You may also want 
to enter a position if signals from other single-day patterns confirm the 
reversal. The risk is relatively small, and the potential reward is relatively 
large. If the stock falls below the lowest low, you’ll know your trade has failed 
and you must exit. Otherwise, hold the position until the stock tests the pivot 
point (see previous section).
Using the NEM chart in Figure 9-13 to illustrate this strategy, the buy trigger 
occurred on August 16 when NEM showed the single-day reversal pattern at 
the bottom of the trough. Your entry point would be the next trading day, 
and your stop would be below $37.60, the low for that reversal bar.
Looking at other patterns
Many other reversal patterns are published in technical analysis books and 
magazines, but the ones in the preceding few sections, we believe, are the 
most reliable.
 
Inexperienced traders always want to find the Holy Grail, that pattern or 
indicator that enables them to profitably trade the turn-on-a-dime “V” pattern. 
In truth, however, “V” bottoms don’t happen all that often. And when they 
do, many reasons express why it’s probably not the best trading opportunity 
available to you. If you talk shop with other traders, you’re certain to hear 
them discuss many esoteric patterns. We know them, but we rarely trade 
them. The simple techniques we’ve shown you in this chapter will enable you 
to trade profitably. No need to look for the esoteric when the simple does the 
job just as well.

T
echnical analysis helps you identify new price trends and look for 
endings to existing trends. Being able to identify those two extreme end 
points means you can develop a powerful, profitable trend-following trading 
system. Technical analysis can also help you evaluate the persistence of 
a trend, which is useful for finding secondary entry points and generating 
short-term trading signals.
In this chapter, we discuss trading strategies for several trend-following 
techniques. We also look at methods for identifying continuation patterns, 
retracement patterns, and reversal patterns, together with strategies for 
dealing with the inevitable failed trading signal.
Identifying Trends
Identifying a trend is relatively straightforward. Instinctively, you know it 
when you see it. Visual techniques and calculated indicators both can be 
used to identify trend signals. We discuss visual identification techniques in 
this chapter. We cover calculated indicators in Chapter 11.

156
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
A steadily rising or falling stock is a trending stock. But if you watch stocks for 
any period of time, you know that they rarely go straight up or down. Instead, 
you see a stair-step effect in which a stock rises several steps and then falls 
back. Talking about a trend as a series of intermittent highs interrupted by 
intermittent lows makes good sense. So an uptrend, then, is a series of higher 
intermittent highs and higher intermittent lows. Conversely, a downtrend is a 
series of lower intermittent highs followed by lower intermittent lows.
Figure 10-1 shows a price chart of Polycom Inc. (PLCM) stock exhibiting a 
series of higher intermittent highs and higher intermittent lows. (From here 
on out, for simplicity’s sake, we call these higher highs and higher lows.)
 
Figure 10-1:

The PLCM example shows the type of trends that you hope follow the 
breakout patterns we discuss in Chapter 9. As long as the pattern of higher 
highs and higher lows continues, you can participate in a profitable trade.
Figure 10-2 shows a downtrending price chart of American International 
Group’s (AIG) stock that identifies its series of lower highs and lower lows. 
You may recall hearing about the government bailout of AIG during the credit 
crisis. You may also notice that the company’s stock performance signalled 
trouble long before the credit crisis began.

Supporting and Resisting Trends
You may have noticed in Figure 10-2 that a higher intermittent high formed in 
the midst of the downtrend exhibited by the chart. That anomaly is 
identified as a retracement on the chart (see the “Withstanding 
Retracements” section later in the chapter). It happened again a few months 
later. Although the series of lower highs and lower lows appeared to have 
been broken, AIG’s downtrend remained intact and continued its fall.
 
In an uptrend, as long as the pattern of higher highs and higher lows continues, 
you can say that the trend persists. The converse (lower highs and lower 
lows) is true in a downtrend. Unfortunately, you cannot say that breaks in 
these patterns signal the end of any trends.
Sometimes you see an uptrend pattern broken when the stock fails to reach 
a new high or when it makes a lower intermittent low. You may actually see 
several of these disconcerting lower lows, only to witness the resumption 
of a strong uptrend. As such, you need to anticipate these eventual hiccups 
as you plan your trading strategy, and you need tools to help you determine 
whether a stock is still trending or the trend has reached its end.

158
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Drawing trend lines to show support
Trend lines are drawn underneath a trend, much as support lines are drawn 
underneath a trading range as described in Chapter 9. And just like the 
support line, trend lines show areas of trading-range support that can be used 
to trigger short-term trading signals as you monitor the progress of a trend.
If you remember your days in geometry class, you’ll recall that only two 
points are needed to define any line. Knowing which points to choose is the 
trick when drawing a trend line. You may, for example, choose to have the 
trend line touching two or more of the intermittent lows, as is the case in 
Figure 10-3. Or you may choose to draw the trend line based on the lowest 
closing prices between those intermittent lows.
 
Figure 10-3: 
Finding a 
trend line.
 
Trend line
Unfortunately, drawing trend lines is not a precise discipline, and no universal 
consensus exists for where and how to draw them. In fact, you’re not likely 
to find any two traders drawing trend lines in exactly the same place for the 
same stock. Furthermore, you’ll drive yourself crazy trying to touch all the 
important lows with your trend line.
Trend lines are drawn to fit historical data. That the trend rides atop the 
trend line is not surprising, given that you drew it that way. However, 
whether that trend line represents the actual trend or is able to generate 
reliable trading signals is constantly in doubt.
So many variables apply. You might, for example, draw the trend line on a 
traditional price scale as we’ve done here, but that trend line will look very 
different from one drawn on a log or semi-log scale that shows percentage 
price changes. It’s hard to know which is the better choice. Also, trend lines 
are often drawn using the oldest historical data, but newer data are more 

159
 Chapter 10: Following Trends for Fun and Profit
relevant for generating trading signals. As such, constantly questioning your 
information and continually updating your trend line is a good habit 
to follow.
Watching the price bar cross below the trend line can be disturbing; it can 
signal the end of the trend, or it may mean that you need to redraw the trend 
lines. Unfortunately, when the stock price closes below the trend line you can’t 
know whether the penetration represents the end of the trend or just another 
opportunity to redraw the trend line to conform to the newest price data.
 
An alternative technique for drawing the trend line reduces the ambiguity just 
a bit. Instead of drawing the trend line from left to right, the way most people 
instinctively do, draw the trend line backward, or from right to left. Using the 
two most recent intermittent lows in the trend, draw the trend line backward 
as long as it is meaningful, then project the trend line toward the right. This 
approach has a couple of benefits:
 
✓ The slope of the trend line is more closely aligned with the most recent 
trading data, which usually are more relevant to your trading decisions.
 
✓ You’ll resign yourself to the necessity of continually redrawing your 
trend lines based on the newest data.
Surfing channels
Traders use a channel to identify potential entry and exit points during a 
trend. Channel lines are formed when a line is drawn parallel with the trend 
line across a trend’s intermittent highs. This top channel line is analogous 
to the resistance line in a trading range, which we discuss in Chapter 9. The 
original trend line then becomes the bottom channel line. Figure 10-4 shows 
an example of a channel.
 
Figure 10-4: 
A channel.
 
Channel lines

160
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Trending and channelling strategies
The strategies for using trend lines and channels are similar. When an 
uptrending stock approaches the trend line or the bottom channel line, 
short-term traders often see an opportunity to take a position in the direction 
of the dominant trend. As long as the stock’s price does not fall through this 
support level, they will hold the position. Position traders, on the other hand, 
may use these same conditions to validate their existing positions as still 
viable. If, however, the stock closes below the trend line and remains below 
it for longer than a day or two, position traders and short-term traders must 
consider the possibility that the trend has reached its end. It’s even possible 
that the trend has reversed.
It may seem perverse, but when an upwardly trending stock breaches the top 
channel line, it’s not always good news. The stock may be overextended. At 
the very least, it’s an indication to traders to pay close attention. In Figure 
10-4, PLCM rose outside of its top channel line several times. The trend failed 
soon afterward (but that isn’t shown in Figure 10-4).
 
Trend lines and channels work better across longer periods of time. A stock 
price that violates a long-running, persistent trend or channel line on a weekly 
chart provides more meaningful guidance than when it breeches a support 
line on a daily chart or an intraday chart. In our experience, short-term trend 
lines add little information that isn’t already present in the steady march of 
higher highs and higher lows.
When a stock breaks a short-term trend line, we believe it’s best to step back 
one time increment to evaluate the situation. For example, if you’re trading 
based primarily on daily chart data, display a weekly chart and examine the 
trend line and the series of intermittent highs and lows. If the march of higher 
highs and higher lows remains intact on the weekly chart, you may want to 
give your position a little room to work itself out. However, if a longer time 
frame shows a break in the pattern of higher highs and higher lows, consider 
exiting your position right away.
 
We use trend lines for guidance while trading, but rarely do we make decisions 
solely on the basis of a trend-line penetration. Although initiating short-term 
positions in the direction of the dominant trend is possible by using channels 
to enter and exit the position, doing so is very difficult, and few traders are 
able to engage in that practice profitably. Some traders even take this concept 
one step further by trying to take positions in opposition to the dominant 
trend as the stock price approaches the upper channel line. We believe trading 
in the direction opposite that of a dominant trend and a stock’s fundamental 
picture is foolhardy and an excellent way to lose a substantial portion of your 
trading capital.

161
 Chapter 10: Following Trends for Fun and Profit
Bottom line: Trend lines and channels are additional tools you can use to 
monitor the progress of a stock price trend. They can be used to help identify 
trading opportunities, but we recommend they not be your primary method 
of determining entry and exit points.
Seeing Gaps
A price gap forms on a bar chart when the opening price of the current bar 
is above or below the closing price of the previous bar. Gaps occur mostly 
on daily charts, sometimes on weekly charts, and rarely on intraday charts. 
Depending on the circumstances, gaps can show continuation and reversal 
patterns, and they can signal an opportunity to enter or exit a position.
Some gaps are obvious and some are subtle. For example, if the opening 
price is above the previous close, but the low of the current bar is below the 
previous high, then those bars overlap and the gap is hard to spot. Many 
traders simply ignore that type of gap. If, however, the low of the current bar 
is obviously higher than the high of the previous bar, that will draw the 
attention of most traders. Examples of obvious gaps are shown in the 
following sections.
Gaps are divided into several broad categories based on where the gap 
occurs. These categories determine your trading strategy and are discussed 
in the sections that follow.
Common gap
Gaps that occur within a trading range, as described in Chapter 9, can be 
either a common gap or a breakout gap. If the gap occurs in the middle of the 
trading range, far from either the support or resistance level, it is a common 
gap. Common gaps occur frequently and are, well, rather common. They 
rarely provide meaningful trading opportunities. Ignoring them usually is the 
best policy. Figure 10-5 shows several common gaps and a breakout gap.
Breakout or breakaway gap
When a stock price exceeds a high of a price range during a specific time 
frame or falls below the low during that same period and simultaneously 
forms a gap, traders describe that situation as a breakout or breakaway gap. A 
breakout gap often provides excellent trading signals to enter a new position, 

162
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
in the direction of the gap. Figure 10-5 shows an example of a breakout gap 
from a long-standing trading range. We discuss trading strategies for trading 
range breakouts in Chapter 9.
 
Figure 10-5: 
Breakout 
gap and 
common 
gaps.
 
Breakout Gap
Common Gap
Continuation gap
A continuation gap is also known as a runaway gap or an acceleration gap. 
This type of gap occurs within an uptrend when the open price of the current 
bar is higher than the close price of the previous bar. If the low of the current 
bar is also obviously above the high of the previous bar, this gap usually 
indicates that the trend is very strong. Continuation gaps may also occur in 
downtrends. The defining characteristics are opposite those of the uptrend.
Figure 10-6 shows several examples of continuation gaps in a downtrend. 
Some short-term traders may use a continuation gap as a signal to enter a 
position in the direction of the gap. Position traders may use this same signal 
to confirm that a current trade remains viable. You sometimes see a series of 
runaway gaps occur in close proximity to each other, and these gaps usually 
are a strong confirmation of the prevailing trend. However, continuation gaps 
also warrant caution, because they can turn into an exhaustion gap.

Exhaustion gap
Exhaustion gaps occur at or near the ends of strong trends. Unfortunately, 
the defining characteristics for an exhaustion gap are virtually identical to 
those for a continuation gap. Exhaustion gaps are often accompanied by very 
large volume, which is one clue that the gap may not be a continuation gap. 
Otherwise, distinguishing an exhaustion gap from a continuation gap is 
sometimes impossible, until the stock price changes direction. By that time, 
it is usually obvious that something is wrong with the trade and you should 
exit your position.
In Figure 10-6, we actually assume the final gap is a continuation gap, 
because if the stock price continues its trend, it will become one. If, however, 
the stock price reverses, the gap may be classified as an exhaustion gap. 
Reversal patterns are discussed in Chapter 9. Sometimes, an exhaustion gap 
turns into an island gap.
Island gap
An island gap, or an island reversal (Figure 10-7), forms when a trend changes 
direction. The pattern is actually two gaps that isolate either a single bar or 
a short series of bars from the dominant trend and the new trend. An island 

164
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
gap usually is a good indicator that the prior trend has been extinguished 
and can be used to signal an exit from an existing position. You may also use 
an island gap to initiate a new position, but only if the direction of the new 
trend aligns with the stock’s underlying fundamental condition. Be sure 
to review the “Dealing with Failed Signals” section in this chapter before 
initiating any positions based on an island gap.

Island gap.

Waving Flags and Pennants
Flag and pennant patterns represent areas of consolidation on a trend chart. 
You’ve already encountered these patterns, just not by name. In a series of 
higher highs and higher lows, these patterns form the basis for the higher 
lows. In other words, the higher lows are made of flag and pennant patterns.
A pennant pattern looks like, well, a pennant. Support and resistance lines 
converge into a point forming what looks like a small pennant shape. A flag 
pattern, on the other hand, is bounded by parallel lines. All these patterns 
almost always fly counter to the prevailing trend, but the direction in which 
they’re flying is not actually a requirement.
Figure 10-8 shows examples of flags and pennants on the chart of a trending 
stock.

165
 Chapter 10: Following Trends for Fun and Profit
 
Figure 10-8: 
Flags and 
pennants.
 
Pennant
Flag
 
The key for each of these patterns is the breakout. If the breakout from the 
formation is in the direction of the established trend, then the trend continues. 
If not, it’s possible that the trend is over.
Flags and pennants typically are associated with a trend, but you may also 
see these patterns within the confines of a trading range. A flag or pennant 
forming near the top of a trading range hints of an eventual breakout. The 
flag or pennant pattern shows the stock consolidating near the top of the 
trading range, and that suggests that selling pressure is diminishing and the 
stock is preparing to test the zone of resistance.
Withstanding Retracements
A retracement occurs when a trending stock revisits recent prices. You’ve 
already seen many examples. When a stock makes a higher intermediate high 
and then a higher intermediate low, that is a retracement. A trading range as 
discussed in Chapter 9 can also be considered a retracement. You may hear a 
retracement called a price consolidation or a pullback, but the concept is the 
same.

166
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Flags and pennants are relatively simple forms of retracement patterns. More 
complex retracements can occur within the confines of a trend, and like 
their simpler counterparts they don’t actually signal the end of the trend. 
Unfortunately, complex retracements cause confusion and consternation 
for traders when they occur. Besides being difficult to anticipate, they send 
out conflicting signals to traders trying to make sense of which trading-plan 
adjustments are needed.
Three-step and five-step retracements
In an uptrend, you sometimes see breaks in the pattern of higher highs and 
higher lows when the stock price fails to reach a new high or makes a lower 
intermittent low. You may see several occurrences of these worrisome 
lower lows and lower highs happen one right after the other followed by a 
resumption of a strong uptrend.
You will see a couple of these benign multistep patterns frequently occur 
in the midst of a strong trend, so it’s useful to watch for them. A three-step 
retracement makes at least one lower intermittent high and one lower 
intermittent low. A five-step retracement makes two lower highs and two 
lower lows. Multistep retracements also occur when a downtrending stock 
makes higher highs and higher lows.
Figure 10-9 shows an example of a five-step retracement that ultimately 
resolves in the direction of the prevailing trend. The five steps are identified, 
along with the corresponding intermittent highs and lows.

 Chapter 10: Following Trends for Fun and Profit
Trust us when we tell you that situations like these are disconcerting 
whenever you’re holding a position. They’re not, however, absolute signals 
that a trend has reached its end. Knowing when a trend has ended, however, 
is nearly impossible, so you need a plan for dealing with it when it happens.
 
Where the multistep retracement occurs within a trend has some bearing on 
what plan you choose. If the stock price has just broken out of a long trading 
range and then falters, you may want to wait for a subsequent attempt to 
break out of the trading range, but closing the position is probably best. Look 
for trading opportunities elsewhere.
If a stock price starts what may be a three-step or a five-step retracement 
after a long period of trending, and your position is profitable, you may want 
to see how the retracement plays out. Absent any obvious sell signals, such 
as an island reversal or a downside breakout from a flag, pennant, or trading 
range formation, you can wait to see how the retracement resolves itself.
Checking out a chart that reflects a longer time frame can be helpful. For 
example, you can examine a weekly chart when the retracement occurs on 
the daily chart. If the trend shows no signs of faltering on the weekly chart, 
hold your position. If the stock recovers and heads higher, so much the 
better, but if it establishes another lower high and trades below its next 
lower low, it’s time to exit.
Finally, considering fundamental factors before making your decision makes 
good sense. If a company’s deteriorating financial situation is an underlying 
cause of the retracement, then exiting your position makes sense. You also 
need to be aware of the cycle the economy is in when making your decision. 
If the economy is approaching a turning point as your stock’s technical 
situation deteriorates, getting out of the position usually is a good idea.
Dealing with subsequent trading ranges
A trading range or a cup and handle formation, like the ones we describe 
in Chapter 9, also are complex consolidation patterns. A trend that’s 
interrupted by a period of range-bound trading may indicate either a pause 
before the trend resumes or the end of the trend. The only way of knowing 
which way the trend will go is to watch for the breakout. Unfortunately, you 
may be in for a long wait.
In the retracement pattern shown in Figure 10-9, you can make a valid 
argument interpreting the five-step retracement as a cup and handle formation. 
Technical analysis is an imprecise discipline, so you may encounter ambiguous 
situations like this. The results in this case were the same regardless of your 
interpretation. The stock broke out of its nine-week complex consolidation 
pattern and resumed its trend.

168
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
 
Breakouts that occur in the direction of the prevailing trend may indicate that 
the trend has farther to run, but they may also be a prelude to a failed breakout 
signal. Trading-range breakouts provide the strongest signals when they result 
in a change of direction from the previous trend.
Dealing with Failed Signals
All trading signals are subject to failure. Sometimes, things just don’t work 
out as planned. However, even a failed signal provides additional information 
that you can use to revise your trading plans. In fact, sometimes the best 
trading signals are the direct result of a failed signal.
Trapping bulls and bears
Breakouts from trading ranges and cup and handle patterns sometimes fail. 
These failures happen to bullish and bearish signals, and when they fail it is 
called a trap. The two kinds of traps are
 
✓ Bull traps, which occur after an upside breakout. The stock breaks out 
of its trading range to the upside but then reverses back into the trading 
range and ultimately breaks out to the down side.
 
✓ Bear traps, which occur after a downside breakout. This opposite 
scenario to the bull trap often is very bullish. The stock reverses course 
and reenters the trading range. If a bear trap occurs within a trading 
range that’s preceded by a long period of declining prices, it often 
represents an excellent buying opportunity, because it’s a sign that 
selling pressure has evaporated in the stock, which thus is likely to 
attempt an upside breakout.
Whenever you see a potential bear trap taking place and the stock meets all 
of your fundamental criteria, you may want to enter a long position as soon 
as the stock price reenters the trading range.
Filling the gaps
A gap that’s forming usually is interpreted as a signal that the prevailing 
trend will continue. If a stock reverses and retraces prices within the gap, we 
say that the gap has been filled. A gap that’s filled negates the trading signal 
that it generated.

169
 Chapter 10: Following Trends for Fun and Profit
 
When dealing with a breakout gap, a stock price that falls back through 
the trading range resistance zone and fills the gap is likely to be a bearish 
development. Similarly, when a continuation gap is filled, you need to consider 
it a failed signal and exit your position. The same is true for an island gap. If 
prices trade back into the area of the isolated island, the trading signal has 
failed and you need to exit your position.
Deciding whether to reverse directions
A bear trap shows an example of where taking a position based on a failed 
signal makes sense. If, however, you already have a position and the signal 
fails, exiting your position is a wise choice — you’re letting the market sort 
out its psychosis without risking your money.
You also need to consider economic and fundamental factors when deciding 
how to handle a failed signal. Acting on a contrary signal makes sense only 
when economic and fundamental conditions support the decision.
For example, if a bullish signal fails and becomes a bearish signal, selling 
a stock short makes sense only if it’s fundamentally weak and the stock’s 
sector is in decline. Conversely, if a bear trap occurs and generates a buy 
signal, taking a position in the stock makes sense only if its earnings are 
strong and growing, its sector is performing well, and the economy is on an 
upswing.

Calculating Indicators 
and Oscillators
In This Chapter

▶ Deciphering relative strength
T
he personal computer ushered in a new era for technical analysts. 
Today’s Internet-connected computers offer data access and analytic 
capabilities at speeds that were impossible only a decade or two ago. That’s 
not to say that calculated indicators and oscillators weren’t used before the 
PC, but rather that these indicators were so difficult to calculate and maintain 
that few technicians performed these calculations for themselves. Even fewer 
had access to real-time analysis tools that traders now take for granted.
However, the ease of calculating, modifying, testing, and using computer-
generated trading tools is as much a curse as it is a blessing. New traders 
often shun visual pattern analysis, instead preferring computer-generated 
indicators and oscillators. To do so is a mistake. Although the perceived 
precision of these calculations seems to add to their allure, you nevertheless 
need to be aware that computer-generated analysis tools are not necessarily 
more accurate, and neither are computers able to generate higher-quality 
trading signals than visual pattern analysis.
 
The indicators and oscillators that we describe in this chapter provide you 
with additional insight into the technical condition of a stock or the market; 
however, they can’t provide faultless trading signals. No indicator works in 
every situation, finds every opportunity, and generates only accurate trading 
signals.
As a new trader, you risk paralysis by analysis by trying to follow too many 
indicators. You have too many choices. This chapter describes how to 
create and use a tiny subset of the tools that are available in today’s charting 
packages. We recommend that you become familiar with a small set of tools 
that can help you trade profitably, rather than learning how every available 

172
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
tool works. Find out how to trade profitably using this subset of tools before 
deciding what you need to add to your toolbox.
The computer-generated tools that we use every day are described in this 
chapter. Two types of moving averages are discussed, along with the moving 
average convergence divergence indicator (MACD) and the stochastic 
oscillator. In addition, the powerful concept of relative strength is described.
These tools are but a tiny subset of the technical analysis tools that are 
available online or in software charting packages. And yet this subset is more 
than enough to get you started as a profitable trader. Become familiar with 
these tools. Play around with them using historical data to see when they 
work and when they fail, and try to understand why. That way, you can know 
when the tools can help you and when they can’t.
The Ins and Outs of Moving Averages
A moving average is a trading indicator that shows the direction and magnitude 
of a trend over a fixed period of time. Some traders call it a price overlay, 
because it’s superimposed over the price data in a bar chart. Moving averages 
visually smooth out the data on a price chart to help make trend identification 
less subjective. All moving averages follow a stock’s price trend but can’t 
predict changes. They report only what has happened.
As its name implies, a moving average shows the average of a stock’s up-and-
down price movements during a specific period of time. A stock’s daily 
closing price usually is the value being averaged, but any value on a price 
chart can be displayed as a moving average. Some traders, for example, 
prefer using the mid-point between daily high and low prices for the moving 
average calculation, but you can also use the opening, high, or low prices or 
any coincident value on a price chart, including volume.
You’ll find that moving averages are used as indicators by themselves or in 
conjunction with other indicators. They are also the building blocks for other 
indicators and oscillators such as the moving average convergence/divergence 
(MACD) invented by Gerald Appel in the 1960s. Before discussing how the 
MACD is used (see the section “Discovering MACD” later in the chapter), we 
must explain moving averages and how they are calculated. In this section we 
describe two of the many types of moving averages.
Simple moving average
A simple moving average (SMA) is simple to calculate and simple to use. 
To calculate it, you add a number of prices together and then divide by the 
number of prices you added.

173
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
An example makes the SMA clearer. In this example, a nine-day moving 
average of Intel’s (INTC) closing price is calculated throughout May 2008 and 
then is plotted on a price chart. To start the SMA calculation, use the closing 
prices shown in Table 11-1. Add the first nine closing prices together, from 
May 1 through May 13, and divide by 9. The resulting value is placed alongside 
the ninth trading day, May 13, and each subsequent day in the month.

Figure 11-1 shows a bar chart associated with the price data in Table 11-1. 
The SMA data are superimposed on the bar chart’s price data. Notice that 
you need nine prices before you can plot the first SMA point. In other words, 
the first SMA point appears on the ninth price bar, and the first eight price 
bars do not display an SMA value.

174
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
To calculate the second SMA point, add the prices from May 2 through May 
14 together, divide by 9, and place the result as the SMA data point next to 
May 14. Another way to think of calculating SMAs is that you drop the oldest 
price in the calculation and add the closing price from the next price bar. 
Continue this series by dropping the oldest price, adding the newest price, 
and dividing by 9 for the remainder of the month.
 
Figure 11-1: 
This chart 
reveals a 
nine-day 
simple 
moving 
average for

Simple Moving Average
If you’re mathematically inclined, here’s what the series looks like as an 
equation:
SMA = (P[1] + P[2] + P[3] + . . . P[N]) ÷ N
Where: N is the number of periods in the SMA
P[N] is the price being averaged (usually the closing price)
Traders used to calculate SMAs by hand, but fortunately, computers now 
relieve traders from this rather mundane chore. The way you use a moving 
average in your trading is discussed in the next section.
Exponential moving average
Another commonly used moving average is the exponential moving average 
(EMA), which can be superimposed on a bar chart in the same manner as 
an SMA. The EMA is also used as the basis for other indicators, such as the 
MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicator, which we discuss 
later in this chapter.
Although the calculation for an EMA looks a bit daunting, in practice it’s 
simple. In fact, it’s easier to calculate than an SMA, and besides, your 
charting package will do it for you. Here are the calculations:

175
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
EMA [today] = (Price [today] × K) + (EMA [yesterday] × (1 – K))
Where: N = The length of the EMA
 
K = 2 ÷ (N + 1)
 
Price [today] = The current closing price
 
 
EMA [yesterday] = The previous EMA value
 
 
EMA [today] = The now current EMA value
The start of the calculation is handled in one of two ways. You can either 
begin by creating a simple average of the first fixed number (N) of periods 
and use that value to seed the EMA calculation, or you can use the first data 
point (typically the closing price) as the seed and then calculate the EMA 
from that point forward. You’ll see other traders handling it both ways, but 
the latter method makes more sense to us. It’s the method used in calculating 
the EMA amounts in Table 11-2, which shows a nine-day EMA calculation for 
Intel throughout May 2008. The EMA value for May 1 is seeded with that day’s 
closing price of $23.29. The actual EMA calculation begins with the May 2 
closing price. For comparison, we include the results of the earlier SMA 
calculation to illustrate the difference between an EMA and an SMA.

In this example, the EMA doesn’t show the same nine-day lag at the beginning 
of the chart as the SMA. Notice that the results of the moving average 
calculations also differ. Figure 11-2 shows the data from Table 11-2 plotted 
on a chart. The EMA data are shown as a solid dark line. For comparison, the 
SMA data are also plotted using a lighter line. (StockCharts.com, our chart 
vendor, handles both the EMA and SMA differently than we’ve shown here. 
They use historical data to calculate the first EMA data point, and they 
automatically fill in the missing data on the charts for the first N periods in 
the SMA calculation.)

Exponential Moving Average
Simple Moving Average
Comparing SMA and EMA
The SMA and EMA are used regularly by position and short-term traders 
alike. Each moving average has its strengths and weaknesses. Which one you 
choose is somewhat a matter of personal preference, but one probably is 

177
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
better suited than the other in several situations. As position traders, we use 
both. We use a relatively long-term SMA to help signal exit points, and we use 
EMAs whenever we rely on the MACD indicator (see the “Discovering MACD” 
section, later in the chapter).
Consistency
An SMA has the benefit of being consistently calculated from one charting 
package to the next. If you ask for a nine-period SMA, you can be certain that 
the result will be identical to every other nine-period SMA for the same stock 
during the same time period (as long as no errors have occurred in the price 
data — it’s rare, but it happens).
 
Unfortunately, EMAs are not always consistent, because of the way the EMA 
is calculated — the starting point matters. You actually need more data when 
calculating an EMA than was used in the example in Table 11-2. In theory, you 
need to use all the price data available for any individual stock. In practice, 
however, that rarely is done. Some charting software packages enable you to 
specify how much data are used when calculating an EMA, but most Internet 
charting sites do not. The result: One charting vendor may calculate EMA 
values that are significantly different than the ones provided by another.
Discovering that you’re basing your trading decisions on an inaccurate 
moving average is more than a bit disconcerting. This problem occurs 
with short-period calculations such as the nine-day EMA example in Table 
11-2, but it is especially problematic for longer-term EMA calculations. 
Unfortunately, the only thing you can do is ask your chart supplier how much 
data it uses when calculating an EMA and then verify the resulting EMA by 
hand. Otherwise, you risk making trading decisions on faulty data. Also, if 
you use more than one charting package, make sure they both use the same 
method to calculate the EMA.
Reaction time
In general, short-term traders are more likely to employ EMA, but position 
traders are more inclined to use SMA. The EMA usually is closer to the current 
closing price, which tends to make it change direction faster than the SMA. 
As a result, an EMA is likely to be quicker in signalling short-term trend 
changes.
 
The SMA probably is the better indicator for identifying long-term changes 
in a trend. Unfortunately, those signals are likely to take more time to appear 
than the ones generated by a comparable EMA. The method used to calculate 
the SMA causes it to react to price changes a bit slower, and that’s the trade-
off for getting a signal that is potentially more reliable.

178
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Sensitivity
An unfortunate result of the method of calculating an SMA is that every time 
you add a price, another price falls off the back end of the equation. In other 
words, each new SMA data point is affected by two prices, the most recent 
closing price and the oldest closing price in the calculation. Ideally, you want 
the most recent data having a greater influence on your indicators than the 
impact of older data. But in an SMA, the oldest price affects the newest SMA 
point with the same weight as the newest price.
EMA calculations eliminate that problem. Each data point affects the EMA 
only once. You never have to drop the oldest price as a new price is added. 
For that reason, the EMA has a much longer memory than the SMA. Every 
price ever used in calculating EMA has some small effect. As an added 
benefit, EMA calculations place additional weight on the most recent price.
To understand how this works, examine the role played by the coefficient K 
in an EMA calculation. In the earlier example showing a nine-period EMA, the 
value of K (the newest price) is 0.20, or 20 percent.
For N = 9; K = 2 / (N + 1) → K = 2 / (9 + 1) = 2 / 10 = .20 = 20 percent
This means every new price added to the calculation represents 20 percent 
of the value of the EMA, while all the previous data represent 80 percent of 
it. The implication: The oldest data always have an impact, but slowly fade 
away, and newer data have a greater influence on the EMA value and the 
placement of the EMA data point.
Notice also that as the EMA period, represented by N, grows larger, the 
value of K becomes smaller, which means that each new data point has less 
influence on the EMA as the period grows larger.
Interpreting and using moving averages
Traders use moving averages to trigger buy and sell signals. In general, when 
a moving average slopes upward, you can infer that the trend is up, and when 
the moving average slopes downward, the trend is down.
One simple mechanical strategy that some traders employ works like this:
 
✓ Buy when the moving average slopes upward and the closing price 
crosses above the moving average.
 
✓ Close the position when the price closes below the moving average.

179
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
 
✓ Sell short when the moving average slopes downward and the closing 
price crosses below the moving average.
 
✓ Close the short position when the price closes above the moving average.
 
Although simple crossover strategies like this are remarkably effective in 
some trending situations, they’re equally ineffective in others. Many variables 
must be in alignment for this approach to work. For example, the stock must 
be trending (see Chapter 10), and the period for the moving average must be 
chosen carefully for the indicator to be effective. These trend-following systems 
fail miserably when a stock is range bound (see Chapter 9).
Figure 11-3 shows an example of this simple mechanical strategy on a chart 
of the Dow Diamonds (DIA), an exchange-traded fund that mirrors the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average. The chart is shown with a 30-day SMA.
The DIA showed a double bottom (see Chapter 10) in June and July 2006. 
Using the trading rules of this simple mechanical strategy, the first buy signal 
occurred on July 24, 2006, when the stock closed above the SMA as the SMA 
turned higher. Although the DIA traded below the SMA several times, it did 
not close below the SMA and generate a sell signal until February 27, 2007.

SMA.
 
As it turns out, this sell signal was triggered during a retracement (see 
Chapter 10). Although it is not shown on this chart, the DIA ultimately 
traded quite a bit higher. Unfortunately, the simple mechanical system 
did not generate another buy signal until the trend was almost completely 
exhausted.
This points out the difficulty you face when your trading strategy is based 
on a moving-average or any trend-following system. When a stock is range 
bound or in a retracement, it’s difficult to know whether the buy and sell 

180
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
signals that the moving average crossover strategy generates are good 
entry or exit signals. Keeping an eye on these complex retracement patterns 
(which we discuss at length in Chapter 10) helps you recognize that DIA may 
have entered a period of retracement — another way of saying the stock is 
trading within a range — in March and April 2007. You can’t know for sure 
whether DIA will break out of its consolidation to the upside or the downside 
until after the breakout actually occurs.
From our perspective, waiting for the breakout causes you little, if any, harm. 
When DIA entered a retracement pattern in March 2007, the economic cycle 
appeared to be ascending and not ready to peak. Other traders, however, 
argue that you risk missed opportunities elsewhere when you’re waiting on 
position in a range-bound stock to break out. Although that argument is valid, 
and favours action on the SMA sell signal, we’re still inclined to wait for the 
breakout before deciding.
We normally want some sort of confirmation signal before entering or exiting 
any position in a stock or exchange-traded fund. For example, we might 
temper the buy signal in the simple mechanical strategy described earlier 
with a requirement that the stock price remains above its SMA for several 
days after the initial signal before entering a position. The same is true for 
the sell, or close, signal. You want the stock to close below the SMA for 
several days, or you’d like to see another coincident sell signal — perhaps 
one of the visual patterns we discuss in Chapter 10 — before exiting your 
position. We use a long-period SMA to provide one of several signals to exit 
from existing positions. For example, if the price closes below a relatively 
long-term moving average and remains below it for a couple of days, we use 
that signal to exit our position.
Support and resistance factors
In addition to their trend-following abilities, moving averages also tend to 
provide support and resistance in stock prices that are trending up or down. 
When a price is trending higher, you often see the stock trade down toward 
the moving average only to reverse course and head higher. The same is 
true in reverse for stock prices that are trending lower. You often see a 
downtrending stock move up toward its moving average before heading 
lower. The moving average acts as an area of resistance.
Back in Figure 11-3, uptrending DIA approached its 30-day moving average 
in mid-August, November, December, January, and February. After each lull, 
DIA headed higher. Short-term traders use these opportunities to enter 
positions in the direction of the dominant trend. When moving averages show 
a stock is trending higher by sloping upward, for example, short-term traders 
buy into a position when the stock price closes near or just below the moving 

181
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
average so they can ride the trend to sell at a higher price later on. Position 
traders also can use these signals as second-chance entry points whenever 
they miss the first breakout. This strategy is called buying on a pullback.
Deciding the moving average time frame
Perhaps the most difficult decision you have to make when creating a moving 
average is determining the length or period that best fits the situation. 
Regardless of whether you select an EMA or an SMA, shorter periods yield 
more signals, but a greater percentage of those signals are false, and longer 
moving-average periods yield fewer signals, but a greater percentage of those 
signals are true. One hitch: Signals occur later in longer-term moving averages 
than they do in shorter-term ones.
 
In general, the shorter your trading horizon, the shorter the moving average 
you want to select. For us, a nine-period moving average is nearly useless. It 
generates too many signals that we have no intention of following. More isn’t 
always better. We want our technical analysis tools to provide better signals, 
not more, because although getting good signals is important, avoiding bad 
signals is even more so.
To reiterate, we rarely use short-term moving averages to generate buy signals. 
Instead, we use a long-period SMA to monitor the health of a trend. Typically, 
we select either a 30-day or 50-day SMA, depending on the duration of the 
existing trend and prevailing economic conditions. If a trend has existed for a 
relatively long period of time, we choose the 50-day SMA as an exit indicator. 
However, if the economy appears to be nearing a peak, as described in Chapter 
5, then we tend to tighten our exit procedures and shorten the SMA. See 
Chapter 13 for more on trading strategies and exit procedures.
 
Traders can fall into a trap when trying to fine-tune the moving average — or 
any indicator, for that matter — for a specific stock or situation. Logically, 
testing many different moving average periods using historical data to find 
the one that generates the most profitable trades and the fewest losing trades 
seems right, and charting software packages enable you to do just that to your 
heart’s content.
However, you’ll soon discover that what worked when using historical data 
often fails miserably when trading real money in real time. This problem is 
well known to statisticians and economists who build mathematic models to 
forecast future events. It is called curve fitting, because you are moulding your 
model to fit the historical data. We talk about this problem more in Chapter 
15. For now, know that fine-tuning an indicator for a specific stock or index 
rarely has any predictive value and you must avoid it. You simply can’t trade 
using historical data. You’re better off settling on a moving average period 
that satisfies the requirements for a great many situations, rather than trying 
to fine-tune the time frame of a moving average to fit each stock.

Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Understanding Stochastic Oscillators
The stochastic oscillator indicates momentum and attempts to show buying 
and selling pressure. This indicator compares current closing prices with 
the recent range of high to low prices and displays the results on a chart. 
Stochastic oscillator values cycle, or oscillate, between zero and 100 percent.
Calculating stochastic oscillators
The typical stochastic oscillator is measured across a 14-day period, but a 
different time frame can be specified. Here’s the calculation:
%K = 100 × (closing price – lowest low (N)) ÷ (highest high (N) – lowest 
low (N))
%D = 3-period moving average of %K
Where: N is the number of periods used in the calculation (usually 14)
This calculation describes a fast stochastic. The names %K and %D, 
respectively, identify the stochastic oscillator and the signal line. We typically 
use a variation of this indicator that’s called a slow stochastic. The slow 
stochastic oscillator calculation is
%K = 3-period moving average of (100 × (closing price – lowest low (N)) ÷ 
(highest high (N) – lowest low (N)))
%D = 3-period moving average of %K
Where: N is the number of periods used in the calculation (usually 14)
In effect, the slow stochastic uses the %D value from the fast stochastic 
calculation as its starting point. Although the fast and slow stochastics look 
similar when plotted on a chart, the slow stochastic is smoother and less 
jumpy. It generates fewer and more reliable trading signals, but the signals 
appear more slowly than with the fast stochastic. Note: You will find that 
some charting packages permit you to specify different values for the moving 
average period, and some even permit you to change from an SMA to an EMA.
Interpreting stochastic oscillators
As we mention earlier, the stochastic oscillator cycles between zero and 100 
percent. Readings of more than 80 percent imply an overbought condition. 
Readings of less than 20 percent are interpreted as an oversold condition. 
As with most indicators, an overbought condition can be resolved if a stock 

183
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
trades lower or enters a period of consolidation. Similarly, an oversold 
condition can be resolved if a stock trades higher or enters a period of 
consolidation.
Overbought and oversold conditions can persist for long periods of time; 
therefore, readings that stay above 80 percent or below 20 percent are not 
enough to generate trading signals. Instead, stochastic oscillator signals are 
generated
 
✓ When the stochastic oscillator moves from below to above 20 percent, 
triggering a buy signal
 
✓ When the stochastic oscillator moves from above to below 80 percent, 
triggering a sell signal
Figure 11-4 shows a slow stochastic oscillator on a price chart for Apple 
(AAPL). Note the transitions from below to above 20 percent that occurred 
in February, April, August, and November. All three represented good entry 
opportunities for this uptrend. Also note that the stochastic buy signals 
coincided with a retracement pattern. Finally, note that few of the indicator’s 
sell signals, where the stochastic oscillator crosses below 80 percent, 
represented good selling or shorting opportunities while Apple was trending 
higher.
 
Figure 11-4: 
Chart of 
Apple stock 
prices 
includes 
a slow 
stochastic 
oscillator.
 
Some traders use a stochastic oscillator crossover strategy, where buy signals 
are triggered when %K crosses above %D and sell signals are triggered when 
%K crosses below %D. For our style of trading, that generates too many sig-
nals, a very high percentage of which are false, as you can see in Figure 11-4.

184
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
The stochastic oscillator is most useful when it’s used in conjunction with 
other indicators. When a stock is trending, the stochastic oscillator is useful 
in finding entry points within a dominant trend. In an uptrend, for example, a 
buy signal that’s generated when the stochastic oscillator moves from below 
to above 20 percent is likely to be a good one. The stochastic oscillator 
signals many overbought conditions within an uptrend and rarely generates 
useful sell signals. It also works well in trading-range situations, and you’ll 
find short-term traders who use it to trigger buy and sell signals when a stock 
is in a trading range.
Discovering MACD
The moving average convergence divergence indicator (MACD) is a trend-
following momentum indicator. MACD is designed to generate trend-following 
trading signals based on moving average crossovers while overcoming 
problems associated with many other trend-following indicators. MACD also 
acts as a momentum oscillator, showing when a trend is gaining strength or 
losing momentum as it cycles above and below a centre zero line. MACD is an 
excellent indicator and an integral part of our trading toolset.
Calculating MACD
Charting packages routinely calculate MACD for you, but knowing how this 
indicator is created is important for gaining a better understanding of how 
it works. The MACD calculation isn’t complex; it’s just three exponential 
moving averages. Here are the steps:
 
1. Calculate a 12-period EMA (see the earlier section on “Exponential 
moving average”).
 
2. Calculate a 26-period EMA.
 
3. Subtract the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA to create the MACD 
line.
 
4. Use the resulting MACD line to calculate a 9-period EMA to create the 
signal line.
 
5. Plot the MACD as a solid line; plot the signal line as either a dashed or 
lighter-coloured line.
An additional indicator, the MACD histogram, is usually shown as part of the 
MACD. It uses a histogram to show the difference between the MACD line and 
the signal line. The histogram is plotted above the zero line when the MACD 
line is above the signal line, below the zero line when the signal line is above 
MACD, and at zero when they cross.

185
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
Figure 11-5 shows a weekly chart of AGCO Corp. (AG) along with an MACD 
indicator and an MACD histogram. When using MACD, we prefer weekly 
charts. That’s how the indicator was originally designed to be used, and for 
our style of trading a weekly MACD indicator provides more useful information 
about the strength and direction of a trend and potential trend reversals. 
You will find that other traders use this indicator for both longer and shorter 
periods as well.
 
Figure 11-5: 
A weekly 
chart of

AG experienced a long period of consolidation before starting to rally in early 
2006. The stock continued its ascent through 2006 and 2007. Notice the 
corresponding periods on the MACD. The MACD line (the solid line) crosses 
over the zero centre line during the third week in February. This was a buy 
signal for this stock. You might also notice that the MACD line crossed the 
signal line in early January 2006. This MACD crossover signal is another early 
indication suggesting a possible new uptrend. See Chapter 13 for more about 
how we use this signal.
Using MACD
 
MACD provides a remarkable amount of information in a concise format. As 
you can see in Figure 11-5, MACD oscillates above and below a centre zero 
line and is a good indicator for showing the direction of the dominant trend, 
signalling

186
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
 
✓ An uptrend when the MACD line crosses above the centre line
 
✓ A downtrend when the MACD line crosses below the centre line
Some short-term traders use the signal line to trigger
 
✓ Buy signals when the MACD line crosses above the signal line
 
✓ Sell signals when the MACD line crosses below the signal line
We don’t, however, find that short-term technique to be very reliable because 
it generates too many false signals. Instead, we prefer using the position of 
the MACD line relative to the zero line as an indication that the stock has 
begun trending.
Figure 11-6 shows a chart of weekly prices for the S&P 500 Depository 
Receipts, sometimes called SPDRs or spyders (the stock symbol is SPY). SPY 
is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 index.
Notice how the SPY establishes a series of higher highs and higher lows 
during the period from June through October 2007, but the MACD line estab-
lishes a series of lower highs during this period. This creates what’s known as 
a divergent pattern. This particular example of a divergent pattern is a bearish 
divergence. In a bearish divergence, the stock establishes a series of higher 
lows and higher highs, while the MACD establishes a series of lower highs. A 
bullish divergence is the reverse: the stock establishes a series of lower lows 
and lower highs, while the MACD establishes a series of higher highs.
 
Divergences that occur in the same direction as the dominant trend are often 
useful for entering positions. However, a divergence that is counter to the 
dominant trend is less likely to be a reliable trading signal. For example, a 
bearish divergence in a dominant uptrend is rarely a good signal to enter a 
short position. This type of bearish divergence may, however, signal that the 
stock has entered, or is about to enter, a period of retracement.
This bearish divergence on SPY is best interpreted as a signal showing that 
the momentum of the multiyear S&P 500 bull market was slowing. In fact, 
the market peaked in October 2007 and remained in a downtrend for many 
months.
Each time the MACD line crosses above or below the signal line suggests a 
potential change in the direction of the dominant trend. Although this is not an 
outright buy signal or sell signal, it does suggest a change may be in the wind. 
In the case of a bearish divergence, the best way to exploit that information 
is to monitor individual stocks and ETFs for weakness, and either close long 
positions when they deteriorate, or initiate new short positions as they present 
themselves. In Chapter 13, we provide additional ideas to help integrate the 
information generated by the MACD indicator into a useful trading strategy.

187
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators

Chart of the 
SPY shows 
a divergent 
MACD 
pattern.
 
 
Most charting packages enable you to fine-tune the MACD calculation. Many 
traders vary the 12-, 26-, and 9-week values. Although nothing is inherently 
wrong with this approach, you nevertheless risk the curve-fitting problem 
whenever you try to find parameters that give you better results for a specific 
stock. That said, Gerald Appel, the man who developed MACD, uses values 
different than the original 12, 26, and 9. He also uses different values to 
generate buy signals than he does to generate sell signals. So feel free to 
experiment and have fun after you gain some experience with the default 
parameters. Because MACD is prone to whipsaw (causing you to lose potential 
profit), many technicians now use MACD as a monitoring tool. Whipsaw is 
like whiplash caused by a violent jerk in the opposite direction when you get 
hit from behind.  Traders can buy shares just before they fall in value or sell 
shares just before they go up in value by reading the MACD tealeaves too 
closely.
Revealing Relative Strength
Relative strength measures the performance of one stock against another, or, 
more commonly, against the performance of an index such as the S&P 500. 
The idea is to determine how the stock is performing compared with the 
broad market.

188
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
 
Unfortunately, you may run across another indicator with a similar name 
when working with your charting software. The other indicator is called the 
relative strength index (RSI) and it is something completely different from the 
relative strength discussed here. RSI is an oscillator that is used in a similar 
way as the stochastic oscillator described earlier. To keep the two separate, we 
suggest you call the RSI by its initials and use the phrase “relative strength” 
when you mean to compare the performance of a stock against a broad-based 
index or another stock.
Calculating relative strength
Among the many ways you can calculate relative strength is simply dividing 
the stock price by the index value and plotting the result, like this:
Relative strength No. 1 = Stock price ÷ Index value
Another technique compares the price of the stock during a given period of 
time against the index during the same period. Our preference is comparing 
percentage changes during the same period. The calculation looks like this:
Relative strength No. 2 = Percentage change in stock price ÷ Percentage 
change in index value
Either of these approaches, or any other that you may invent, can be plotted 
on a stock chart. Some Internet sites provide a relative strength capability; 
see www.stockcharts.com/charts/performance for an example. 
Unfortunately, if you’re using a charting software package, you’ll probably 
have to program it into your system by using its formula-editing capabilities.
Or, you can look it up. Investor’s Business Daily has a proprietary calculation 
for relative strength that ranks stocks based on their six-month performance. 
It is a handy tool.
Putting relative strength to work
 
The goal when examining a stock’s relative strength is not necessarily to find 
the best-performing stocks in the universe of all stocks, but rather to find 
stocks that are performing better than the average stock as each stock signals 
a buy.

189
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
Relative strength is one of the final pieces to the technical analysis puzzle. 
You’ve found a trading candidate when you find a stock that:
 
✓ Exhibits fundamentals as a strong company
 
✓ Has earnings that are growing faster than average
 
✓ Functions well in a strong sector
 
✓ Operates in a growing economy
 
✓ Is approaching a technical buy signal on its bar chart
 
✓ Performs better than the average stock
These characteristics favour a long position, of course. For short-position 
candidates, reverse each criterion.

Money Management Techniques: 
When to Hold ’em, When to Fold ’em
In This Chapter
▶ Building your trading characteristics
▶ Trading successfully and cutting your losses
▶ Managing your holdings
▶ Protecting your money
▶ Knowing your risks
Y
ou may find this hard to believe, but some successful traders have 
more losing trades than winning trades. How? Their profits from win-
ning trades overwhelm the losses from losing trades. The key to this success 
is knowing when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em — disciplined money 
management. You must develop a discipline that keeps your losses under 
control by quickly closing losing positions. The trick is to follow the rules 
you set. Good money management minimizes your trading losses when they 
occur and helps you realize a profit when it hits you right in the old kisser. 
Recognizing winners and losers — and setting your target prices before ever 
entering a position — is crucial to your money management strategy. In this 
chapter, we give you a set of rules to follow to get started.
Identifying Important Characteristics 
of a Successful Trader
Successful traders share a common trait. You’ll find that they all successfully 
manage their money. The critical points of successful money management 
may be difficult to implement, but they’re easy to identify. They include
 
✓ Planning your trades carefully by identifying entry and exit points
 
✓ Minimizing losses by ruthlessly adhering to your stop-loss points

194
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
 
✓ Protecting your profits with trailing stops
 
✓ Exiting your position when the trend ends
When using technical analysis to make your trades, you won’t get the lowest 
entry price or the highest exit price. That means you will always leave some-
thing on the table. The idea is identifying when a trend has begun, entering 
the position, and riding the trend until it ends.
Opening the Door to Successful Trading
Because your way to successful trading is disciplined money management, 
the key to opening that door to success is developing a plan for your trades 
and sticking to that plan, even if it goes against what your gut tells you. 
Sometimes you think you’ve picked what seems like the perfect stock, but 
then it just doesn’t perform the way you expected.
Before entering that trade, you need to set an entry point, the price at which 
you’ll enter a trade, and an exit point where you will exit the trade if it goes 
poorly. Don’t deviate from your plan, even if it means accepting the fact that 
you made a mistake. We discuss setting entry and exit points in the section 
“Protecting Your Principal.” For more info about entering and exiting posi-
tions, check out Chapters 10 and 11.
 
Although it may be cliché, it’s nevertheless true: Cut your losses short and let 
your profits run. In other words, fold (sell) when your losses first appear and 
hold as your profits continue to build.
 
Your most important money management goal is to get out of losing positions 
as quickly as possible. After taking normal up and down price fluctuations 
(as discussed in Chapters 9 and 10) into consideration, you must develop a 
method of recognizing when a stock is not behaving the way you expected, 
and as a result be prepared to close a losing position before it consumes too 
much of your trading capital. Try to keep losses below 5 or 6 percent for any 
position. Or you could think in terms of your total trading capital and try to 
keep the loss from any single position below 1 or 2 percent. Unfortunately, 
achieving a balance between recognizing your losers and dumping them in 
time (knowing when to fold ’em) is more difficult than it sounds.

 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques
Managing Your Inventory
To be successful, you need to treat trading as a business and stocks as your 
business inventory. Just like any other business, you must carefully manage 
your inventory to succeed. Factors paramount to successful trading are:
 
✓ Viewing trading as a business. You trade to make money. Sometimes 
you pick the wrong stock and have to accept a loss. Losses are a part of 
any business. The key to good business planning is minimizing losses.
 
✓ Overcoming the most common trader’s dilemma. Many traders get 
caught up in the moment, trying to defend their position even as it 
moves in the wrong direction. When your choices no longer make good 
business sense, you must quickly make cold, hard decisions and deci-
sively act to cut losses short.
 
✓ Approaching the solution to your trading dilemma as if it’s a business 
problem to solve. Sell when you stand the chance of making a healthy 
profit or when you must accept that you’ve made a mistake and it’s time 
to move on. Select your entry and exit target points before you buy the 
first share.
Thinking of trading as a business
So, how do you start thinking of trading as a business? Conceptually, it’s 
simple. Like any other business, traders have fixed costs; variable costs; 
finite amounts of working capital, assets, and liabilities; fickle customers 
(or fickle market conditions); fickle vendors (market conditions again); and 
inventory. Managing these business factors results in either profits or losses, 
and you, of course, want to maximize the profits and minimize the losses. 
The most important step you can take in treating trading as a business is 
thinking of the contents of your portfolio as your inventory.
 
Traders need to manage their businesses with the same clear-eyed, cold-
hearted detachment as any successful business owner. But many traders, 
even the experienced, find thinking about trading as a business a difficult task. 
They make a decision, take a position, and stick with it regardless of how far 
prices go down — even when their stock flushes farther down the toilet.

196
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Recognizing the trader’s dilemma
 
Selling is hard. For some reason it’s emotionally more difficult to close a 
position, especially a losing position, than it is to open it. Traders rationalize 
holding a losing position by saying to themselves, “I’ll give it some room to 
work out, it’s only a paper loss.” But that rationalization can be foolhardy. You 
never hear traders describe a winning trade as a paper gain, and you shouldn’t 
rationalize losing positions that way, either.
Falling in love
Traders fall in love with their stocks. It’s not hard to understand how falling 
in love with a stock can happen. You spend many a late night finding the right 
stock. You evaluate the economy, find a strong sector, research the financial 
condition of the top companies in the sector, and check the charts. You may 
even use the company’s products or services yourself. You’re a customer.
You didn’t mean for it to happen, but you try to justify your actions as noth-
ing more than a fling . . . really. You find a stock that looks promising, and 
then something clicks. You hardly notice at first, but now you’re in love. So 
you enter your trade, and . . . your stock’s price goes the wrong way. Which 
way is the wrong way depends on your position. If you own the stock and its 
price falls, obviously that’s the wrong way. But if you sell the stock short, the 
wrong way is if its price rises. We discuss the mechanics of selling short in 
Chapter 14. Either way, you’re losing money.
Breaking up is hard to do
After all the late nights, the hard work, and the brilliant analysis, you may 
end up asking yourself, “How could I have been so wrong?” You’re not alone. 
We just kept thinking: “How can everyone else be so wrong? This is a great 
stock. It has to go up. We’ll wait for everyone else to come to their senses, to 
realize the error of their ways, and then this trade will turn out just fine.”
 
The idea that the market may not love your stock, too, sometimes is hard to 
swallow. After you’ve taken a position, a psychological quirk (everyone has 
it) makes you want to be right. Somehow, you need to overcome this quirk. 
Otherwise, it can lead to many losses and possibly to financial ruin.
Finding a better plan
Approaching the trader’s dilemma as though it were a business problem for 
you to solve can be helpful. The business of women’s fashions provides an 
analogy that will do so nicely. The fashion industry works in obvious cycles. 
For example, you see long-term cycles at work as hemlines rise and fall and 
even longer cycles as you witness periodic mysteries that cause Capri pants 

197
 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques
and bell-bottom trousers to appear and just as easily disappear. You also see 
shorter cycles as clothing for the current season is discounted to make way 
for the next season’s fashions. These shorter seasonal cycles illustrate the 
day-to-day issues that traders face.
Picking stock for the seasons
As spring approaches, retailers stock up on colourful, lightweight merchan-
dise. You may even see swimsuits before then for those lucky souls who 
head to the tropics to escape the frosty chill. Fall clothes start showing up in 
stores as summer heats up. Before summer is over, heavier-weight clothes, 
including a selection of winter coats, begin appearing on clothing racks.
Ideally, retailers try to sell all their winter coats — and all their bathing suits 
and spring outfits — before the next season arrives, but that rarely happens. 
Retailers often have unsold inventory as the end of the season approaches.
Cleaning out the stock
You can use a couple of alternatives for handling unsold seasonal inventory, 
but neither is pleasant. The retailer can store the merchandise until next 
year, but storage costs carry charges that eat into capital. The greatest cost 
of storing merchandise is the lost opportunity. The retailer’s capital gets 
locked up in unsold merchandise and thus can’t be used to buy current-
season inventory that’s more in demand. Making matters worse is the fact 
that fashions offer no guarantee they’ll remain fashionable, so selling this 
year’s inventory next year may be impossible.
Another alternative is marking down the price of merchandise beginning rela-
tively early in the season and continuing to do so until all the merchandise is 
sold. This approach quickly
 
✓ Frees up capital the retailer then can use to buy newer inventory
 
✓ Stops the accrual of carrying charges
 
✓ Clears out storage and display space
 
✓ Avoids the risk that the merchandise will become worthless in the future
This solution is better, even though it sometimes means selling the merchan-
dise below cost.
Clothiers buy inventory to sell it at a profit. They know their costs, and they 
determine the profits they want to earn from the sale of each item. Retailers 
try to earn as much profit as possible, but start cutting prices whenever sales 
don’t happen quickly enough. Retailers cannot afford to fall in love with their 
winter coats. They need the space and capital for spring merchandise. They 
don’t get choked up when it’s time to sell.

Keeping your inventory current
Managing your trading business as if you were a retail merchant is a good 
idea. The cycle of economic expansion, peak, recession, and trough, as 
described in Chapter 5, is somewhat akin to the four seasons. Your stocks 
are your inventory. Their prices rise and are discounted in anticipation of 
the changing economic cycles, as described in Chapter 13. And your trading 
account is your working capital. Just like the retail merchant, your goal is to 
protect your principal — your working capital — so you can stay in business.
However, you may find that some factors differ. The stock market is, of 
course, a much more efficient pricing mechanism than the retail clothing 
industry. You can’t set the price of merchandise; the market does it for you. 
You can take several approaches to keep your trading inventory current. 
Many traders use trend analysis and relative strength analysis, as described 
in Chapters 10 and 11, to try to take positions in the best performing stocks 
and sectors. Some traders also track general market conditions, quarterly 
and annual OSC and SEC filings, company announcements, and key analysts’ 
reports, as described in Chapters 5, 6, and 7.
We tend to combine both approaches in the ways we trade. We want to own 
strong stocks in strong sectors, and we want to know how well the companies 
manage their businesses. Although any changes in these elements are worth 
a look-see, we don’t have immediate hair-trigger reactions. We do sometimes 
replace positions that begin to underperform, relative to the market, with 
emerging leaders, and yet we show a little extra patience with positions that 
are profitable but are beginning to slightly underperform. If, however, a stock 
position starts losing money, then we close the position without a second 
thought. The goal is to protect your trading capital, and we show you some 
techniques and examples to accomplish this in the next section.
Protecting Your Principal
In the same way that retail merchants face the possibility of holding on to 
their stock of winter coats that may fall out of style, you can avoid the risk 
of owning a stock that falls out of favour with other investors and loses its 
value. By acting quickly when you see changes in the market, you can avoid 
losing a large chunk of your trading capital (or principal). As long as you get 
out of your position quickly, your trading capital won’t be tied up in a losing 
stock position any longer, and you’ll escape the losing trade with most of 
your cash intact. More importantly, you’ll be able to trade another day.
 
It makes sense, of course, to hold on to a stock as long as its price is appreci-
ating. However, being mindful of when your stock price begins to fall is impor-
tant. You must have a plan for dealing with losing trades or deteriorating 
profits. Time to fold up the stock and get out!

 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques
 
If your goal is to keep trading for a long time, the only way to do that is to not 
lose too much money. This might seem patently obvious, but you would be 
surprised by how few investors, and even some traders, make capital preser-
vation their highest priority. To avoid that mistake, it helps if you keep these 
important goals in mind as you trade:
 
✓ Protect your principal first.
 
✓ Don’t let a large profit turn into a small profit.
 
✓ Don’t let a small profit turn into a loss.
 
✓ Don’t let a small loss turn into a large loss.
Recovering from a large loss: It ain’t easy
 
When thinking about protecting your principal, accept that taking a small 
loss is better than risking a larger one. You need to understand how badly 
(and quickly) things can go wrong, and how that can result in a loss of a huge 
chunk of your capital with little chance of recovering it. To illustrate, check 
out an example of the impact that large losses can have on your money.
Perhaps you bought XYZ stock for $10 per share. The stock falls to $9, rep-
resenting a $1 loss. You’ve lost 10 percent of the original price of the stock. 
To recover from that loss the stock price must rise from $9 to $10, but notice 
that 10 percent of $9 is only 90 cents. In other words, your stock must gain 
more than 10 percent to recover from a 10 percent loss. Here’s how to review 
the math using percentages.
To find the percentage loss, push or click on the respective percent button 
on your calculator or in a computer spreadsheet, or simply divide $1 by $10.
$10 – $9 = $1 → $1 ÷ $10 = 0.10 → 0.10 × 100 = 10%
To find the percentage gain required to recover that $1 loss — again notice 
that your stock is now a $9 stock and that 10 percent of $9 is only 90 cents, 
not $1 — divide $1 by $9.
$1 ÷ $9 = 0.1111 → 0.1111 × 100 = 11.11%
In other words, your $9 stock needs to gain a little more than 11 percent to 
get back to even.
For losses of less than 10 percent, the required gain isn’t significantly greater 
than the loss you’ve just experienced. But for larger losses, the problem 
grows unmanageably. Look at Table 12-1 to see what we mean.

Game Over
Getting a stock to go up 5 or even 10 percent is hard enough. It seems irrational 
to hope for a stock that’s fallen by 50 percent to quickly recover 100 percent, 
or for one that’s fallen by 75 percent to ever recover 300 percent.
 
Selling quickly and avoiding large losses is a much better course. Otherwise, 
you’ll be out of trading capital, and out of business, in a mighty quick hurry.
Setting a target price for handling losses
 
The most important concept of protecting your principal is accepting the fact 
that you made a mistake and moving on. Sell that loser. Don’t let a small loss 
turn into a large one. Before entering a trade, make sure you set a target price 
that you’re willing to initially pay for a stock, and set a target price for selling 
it if the trade results in a loss.
Setting a stop-loss price (or, as traders say, “setting your stop”) is more akin 
to an art than a science. You can employ several techniques for determining 
your stop-loss price. One that others often advocate, but we don’t recom-
mend, is choosing a predetermined percentage loss as your stop-loss price. 
We think using technical analysis (see Chapters 9 and 10) to identify when a 
trade has failed is a better approach. Here’s an example.
Figure 12-1 is a daily price chart of the Gold Trust Shares (GLD) exchange-
traded fund that shows support and resistance lines, respectively, drawn on 
the chart at approximately $63.62 and $67.47 and indicates the ETF has just 
broken out of a long trading range on high-volume. Support, resistance, and 
breakouts are discussed in Chapter 9. The breakout is identified on the chart.
Figure 12-1 represents a picture-perfect setup for entering a trade. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 9, your entry point for this trade occurs above $67.50 
when the ETF breaks through the resistance line. But how do you handle the 
trade if it doesn’t work out? Or, perhaps a better question to ask is, how do 
you know when the trade has failed?

201
 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques
One of several approaches suggests that if the breakout fails (the price 
declines below the resistance level), you need to exit your position imme-
diately. For the GLD example in Figure 12-1, if the ETF were to fall below the 
resistance line ($67.47) after it breaks out above it, you should exit.
Another approach suggests that if the ETF falls below the mid-point of the 
trading range, in this case somewhere around $65.50, then the breakout buy 
signal has failed. In that case, you can use any price below $65.50 as the stop-
loss price to exit from this position.
In the first scenario, the financial risk is small. As long as you get good fill 
prices (fills) on both your entry and exit orders, your risk should be no more 
than $1.00 to $2.00 per share, which reflects a loss of only 1.5 percent to 3 
percent on the trade. We discuss fills further in Chapter 15.
In the second approach, the risk is greater. The difference between the $67.47 
breakout price and the $65.50 stop-loss price is $1.97, but the breakout gap 
means your actual fill price will be $67.90 or more, resulting in a greater per-
centage risk on the trade. Poor fills on either entry or exit orders increase the 
amount at risk.
The trade-off between the two approaches is clear. The first one risks a smaller 
amount before triggering the exit trade, but is prone to whipsaws (see Chapter 
11), which means you may be bumped out of a potentially winning trade. 
The second risks a greater amount but is less prone to whipsaws. In general, 
shorter-term swing traders and day traders (see Chapters 16 and 17) are more 
likely to choose the first, and position traders who expect to hold a trade for 
several weeks or months are more likely to choose the second.
Why traders use percentages to describe results
Why do traders use percentages to describe 
their results? Because it’s a simple way of 
accurately comparing the results of one trade 
with the results of another — as a percentage, 
a $1 gain on a $10 stock is identical to a $10 gain 
on a $100 stock. The price per share is not as 
important as the percentage gain (or loss) or 
the total gain (or loss). Look at it like this: If you 
have $1,000 in your trading account, you can 
buy 100 shares of a $10 stock, or you can buy 
10 shares of a $100 stock. If the price of either 
stock rises by 10 percent, your account total is 
the same in either case — $1,100. A 10 percent 
rise in a $10 stock is $1. A 10 percent rise in a 
$100 stock is $10. But the total amount of money 
earned is the same in either scenario.
If you think in terms of percentage gains or 
losses, you can correctly compare the results 
of one trade with that of another. The actual 
price of a stock, and the actual number of points 
gained or lost, isn’t as important as the size of 
the move in percentage terms. Although you 
can buy many more shares of the lower-priced 
stock, it’s equally difficult for either stock to 
move 10 percent. If you think about it like this, 
you’ll see that no reason exists to favour the 
lower-priced stock, even if you can buy more 
shares, over the higher-priced stock.

Either approach is rational, so choose the one you can live with. If you start 
second-guessing your stop-loss points they’re no longer useful, so be sure to 
use an approach that you’ll honour. Using the first approach may make more 
sense for new position traders, so tight stops can serve as educational tools. 
You’ll risk less on each trade but you’ll be subject to a few whipsaws, and 
you’ll get into the habit of selling when you have small losses. And that’s a 
good habit to learn.
Determining good trading candidates
Whether the ETF in this example (Figure 12-1) is a good trading candidate is 
open to discussion. From a technical perspective (see Chapter 9), it has many 
of the characteristics of a good setup. The same is true for the fundamental 
point of view. The price of the Gold Trust ETF correlates closely with the rate 
of inflation and with many commodity prices, both of which had been rising. 
It also has an inverse correlation to the value of the U.S. dollar, which has 
been losing value for years.
However, GLD had been in an uptrend from 2001 through early 2006. The ETF 
then traded in an increasingly tighter range that lasted through the period 

203
 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques
shown in Figure 12-1. After a long run up in price like this, you must be cir-
cumspect about any stock or ETF, even following the long consolidation 
period in this example. Although stocks can continue to rise in price for very 
long periods of time, neither stocks nor ETFs grow to infinity or beyond.
Even though the technical and fundamental conditions favoured this trade, 
these late-to-the-party setups do not always work out. That’s why we like 
to keep our stops very tight in this kind of a situation. As it turned out, this 
trade was profitable. GLD rallied into the first part of 2008 and peaked over 
$100 before ultimately breaking down.
This example is applicable to any new trading position. To find good trading 
candidates, you need to decide whether the trade makes sense from financial 
and technical perspectives. Then you’ll be better able to identify a trading 
pattern that clearly shows a good entry point and identifies the price point 
when the original trading signal has failed. Only then can you place a stop-
loss order nearby to reduce your risk of losing too much of your precious 
trading capital. Only under those circumstances should you enter the trade.
Strategies for handling profitable trades
Profitable trades are somewhat easier to handle than losses, but they’re not 
without complications. You must decide whether you want to leave your 
stop-loss point where it is or try to lock in a small profit by moving it up.
You obviously want to try to keep any profit from turning into a loss. For 
example, say you enter the GLD trade in the Figure 12-1 example, and a few 
days after entering the order it remains in positive territory with a small 
profit. For this discussion, assume that your original stop price is $65.50, the 
mid-point of the trading range. Your choice is to leave the stop where it is or 
move it above the resistance line, to $67.50. If you choose the former, and the 
stock trades below $65.50, your formerly profitable trade will be closed for 
a loss. If you choose the latter, you will be stopped out if GLD trades below 
$65.50. You must now decide whether to move your stop-loss order to pro-
tect the small profit, or leave the stop where it is to keep from jeopardizing 
the stock’s chances of gaining more.
This balancing act is delicate. You’re trying to catch a bigger trend higher 
and ride it, which argues for leaving the stop where it is for a little while 
longer. But sooner, rather than later, you’ll want to move your stop-loss 
above your entry price. This decision becomes easier as the position pro-
gresses. As your profit grows, you’ll want to continue adjusting your exit 
points upward. This is called a trailing stop, and is discussed in the section 
“Using trailing stops.”

Breaking the pattern of higher highs and higher lows
Trends are easy to see on charts. Examine Figure 12-2, and you can easily 
identify the trend that carried the price of this GLD ETF from less than $65 
per share to $100 per share in six months’ time. In this case, the ETF creates 
a series of higher highs followed by higher lows, interspersed with several 
retracements. See Chapter 10 for more on trends, higher highs and higher 
lows, and retracements.

and higher

Gaps
High Volume
Moving Average
Although this pattern sometimes is difficult to define rigorously, you can 
easily identify it on a chart. Take note that the ETF’s price appears to ride the 
moving average line (see Chapter 11) as it progresses. As a trader, this kind 
of trend is the type you want, and like, to ride for as long as you can, because 
it’ll make you some money.
Figure 12-2 also provides a couple of clues that this trend came to an end in 
March 2008. Notice the price gaps (see Chapter 10) that occur in March, and 
the accompanying high trading volume. These gaps are your first hint that 
the ETF may be in trouble. Another hint is shown at the point where the line 
indicating the ETF’s price closes significantly below its moving average. A third 
hint occurs when the stock fails to reach a higher price after the gap occurs.
Any one of these events may carry enough weight for you to close your posi-
tion. Taken together, they clearly signal that the upward trend probably is 
over, and you need to exit your position.

205
 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques
Using trailing stops
After you’ve entered a position and it becomes profitable, you want to move 
your stop to protect your profits. This is known as a trailing stop, because 
you keep moving it higher as your profits grow. In an uptrend, a stock makes 
intermittent higher highs and intermittent higher lows (see Chapter 10). Use 
the higher lows to define your stop points. After the ETF has made a higher 
high, reset the stop to either the most recent higher low, or the one just 
before it. Using Figure 12-2, after the ETF reaches a new high in early October, 
you should reset the stop using the most recent interim closing low around 
$72.00.
Tracking market indexes
Individual stocks and entire sectors of similar stocks regularly fall in and out 
of fashion. Sometimes these changes happen in a grand way, such as when 
the financial sector fell out of favour in 2007 and 2008.
Look at the weekly chart of the S&P 500 Index in Figure 12-3. Although the 
S&P 500 index peaked in October 2007, by 2008 it had formed a lower high 
and lower low below its recent intermittent lows. The price also closed well 
below its 52-week moving average. By the time 2008 rolled around, the vast 
majority of financial stocks were in worse shape than the broad market index — 
a prime example of a dramatic shift in market conditions. If you were trading 
at the time, you could
 
✓ Sell your positions when you saw that prices, market fundamentals, and 
technical indicators were simultaneously deteriorating.
 
✓ Wait out the market, hoping things would get better.
If you held financial stocks during that time and chose the second option, 
you took a much greater loss by selling later. Unfortunately, many buy-and-
hold investors unwisely believed that the downturn was a temporary blip and 
that financial investments would remain viable. In fact, a number of compa-
nies never recovered and some no longer are trading.
The right choice then, as usual, was to close your positions. By following 
these simple strategies, you’d have had more than enough information to 
know things were not going according to plan. Although you wouldn’t have 
sold your stocks at the highest prices, neither would you have ridden them 
to their ultimate lows. By selling, you protect your profits and your trading 
capital, so you can trade another day.
 
Knowing when a trend is complete is just as difficult as knowing when it 
began. You can’t trade with perfect knowledge, and you can’t predict the 
future — neither can we. But you can use these tools to identify when a trend 
is likely to begin, and when it’s likely to end. And if you use excellent money 
management, you’re likely to trade profitably.

Understanding Your Risks
You need to look at the risks that traders face. The three general categories 
are market risks, investment risks, and trading risks.
Market risks
Market risks are pretty much out of your control. Of course you understand 
the risk that the markets are bound to rise and fall, but understanding the 
risks you face when they do helps you manage your money better. Three key 
risks that you can manage as a trader are
 
✓ Inflation risk: Although inflation is a risk that traders rarely consider, it 
nevertheless impacts people who are afraid to take risks. You definitely 
can’t be a trader if you’re afraid of taking risks. Basically, the risk that 
this factor poses is that your money won’t grow fast enough to exceed 
the increases in costs that inflation causes. As you know, the basics — 
housing, clothing, energy expenses, and food — increase in price each 
year. By investing in monetary vehicles that don’t keep pace with infla-
tion, you actually end up losing money.
 
✓ Marketability risk: This factor relates to how liquid your investment is. 
If you’re restricted from selling your investment when you want to do so, 
your target selling point won’t mean much. For most stock traders, this 
factor isn’t an issue, but if, for example, you choose to invest in a small 
company whose stock isn’t traded on one of the major stock markets, you 
risk not being able to close your stock position when the time is right.

207
 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques
 
✓ Currency translation risk: Currency translation refers to disparities in 
trading stocks of companies in foreign countries. It’s only a factor when 
you trade foreign stocks, because you then must be concerned with fluc-
tuations between the values of your local currency and the currency in 
the country where the company is located. Even if the stock increases in 
price, you can still lose money based on the currency exchange rate. If 
the value of your currency rises against the other currency, your invest-
ment can be worth less when you convert it back.
Investment risks
Investment risks relate directly to how you invest your money and manage 
your entry and exit trades. Two critical risks you must manage are
 
✓ Opportunity risk: This kind of risk involves balancing your trade-offs. 
When you trade, you establish a position that ties up money that oth-
erwise can be used elsewhere. After you choose a stock and buy it, you 
lose the opportunity to buy something else that may strike your fancy, 
until you trade out of the first position. Essentially, you can miss other 
opportunities while your money’s tied up in another position.
 
✓ Concentration risk: This kind of risk happens when you put too many 
eggs in one basket. You may think you’ve found that hot stock that’s 
going to make you a millionaire, so you decide to invest a huge por-
tion of your principal into that stock. By concentrating so much of your 
money on one investment, you also concentrate the risks associated 
with that investment and with the possibility of losing it all.
Trading risks
Risks that are unique to trading increase simultaneously with increases in 
trading volume. Swing traders and day traders often see a greater impact 
caused by these risks than do position traders, but everyone needs to be 
aware of these issues. See Chapters 16 and 17 for more information about 
swing trading and day trading, respectively. Risks associated with trading are
 
✓ Slippage risk: Hidden costs associated with every transaction are the 
focus of this risk factor. Every time you enter or exit a position, your 
account balance dwindles by a small amount. Every time you execute a 
trade, you subject yourself to the problem of buying at the ask price but 
selling at the bid price. The ask price is the lowest price available for the 
stock that you want. The bid price is the highest price someone is will-
ing to pay for shares you own. Unfortunately, the bid price is always less 
than the ask price. Although you can mitigate bid/ask problems by using 
limit orders, doing so subjects you to the risk that your order won’t get 
filled. The amounts for each trade may at first seem small, but as your 

208
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
trading volume increases, so do the amounts you lose to slippage. Trade 
only the stocks of the large, liquid companies so your bid/ask spread 
causes negligible slippage.
 
✓ Poor execution risk: This problem occurs whenever your investment 
adviser or discount broker has a difficult time filling your order, which 
can result from any number of factors, including fast market conditions, 
poor availability of stock, or the absence of other buyers and sellers. 
The result is always the same: The price you expect is somewhat differ-
ent than the price you actually receive. Although you can mitigate this 
problem to a degree by using limit orders, you still risk having the stock 
trade through your limit price and not getting your order filled at all. 
Ditto: trade large, liquid companies.
 
✓ Gap risk: This kind of risk comes into play whenever a break in trading 
occurs. Sometimes a stock opens at a price significantly higher or lower 
than its previous close, and sometimes a stock trades right through your 
exit price. For example, a stock may close at $25 a share today and open 
tomorrow morning at $20. If your planned exit price is $24, and you have 
a stop order in place, your order is likely to be filled at the opening price 
or worse. Price gaps created in this way occur most often at the open. 
And although relatively rare, a gap also can occur during the trading 
day whenever surprising news is reported or trading halts. We hope you 
have more nice gap profits than losses — they both occur regularly, so 
keep your spirit and optimism high.

nowing the current state of the economy can help you improve your 
trading results. However, knowing the current state of the market is 
crucial, because you obviously want to buy stocks in a bull market and sell 
them, or short them, in a bear market. Besides the obvious, you also want 
a strategy for trading stocks during market transitions and consolidation 
phases.
As a result, you need a method for identifying and categorizing the differ-
ing phases of bull and bear markets. We recommend using the six phases in 
the list that follows. Doing so enables you to adjust your trading strategies 
for each phase of the market, regardless of whether you’re trading stocks, 
bonds, indexes, futures, or options. The six phases of the market are
 
✓ Bullish transition: The market is transitioning from a bear market to a 
bull market.
 
✓ Bull market: A persistent rising trend in the market.
 
✓ Bullish pullback: A bull market in the midst of a pullback.
 
✓ Bearish transition: The market is transitioning from a bull market to a 
bear market.
 
✓ Bear market: A persistent downtrend.
 
✓ Bearish pullback: A bear market in the midst of a consolidation.

210
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
This chapter shows you how to identify these phases of the market using the 
techniques of fundamental and technical analyses that we describe through-
out this book. Although no single detail or event can enable you to out-and-
out declare a bull market or bear market, we address many small details that, 
when taken together, enable you to make informed conclusions. Likewise, 
distinguishing a transition phase from a pullback phase can be difficult. This 
chapter helps you methodically analyze the economy, the market, leading 
and lagging sectors, and individual stocks, so you can identify the particular 
phase a market is in. Furthermore, this chapter describes unified trading 
strategies that are built around these market phases.
Seeing the Big Picture
Identifying the current economic climate is the first step toward identifying 
the current phase of the markets. Only a tiny fraction of available economic 
data is required to develop a snapshot of the economy from which you can 
infer the current state of the markets. The conditions that you need to know 
(and questions you need to ask) to be able to evaluate and determine the 
cycle that the economy currently is in are
 
✓ Where are interest rates headed? Are they rising, falling, or staying the 
same?
 
✓ What are officials of the BoC and the Fed doing now? What are they 
likely to do in the future?
 
✓ How is business performing in general? Is industrial production rising or 
falling?
 
✓ Which sectors are leading and which are lagging? Are economically sen-
sitive stocks appreciating or declining in value, or are traders currently 
favouring defensive stocks?
This information is crucial for determining the cycle in which the economy 
currently is functioning. (For more about economic cycles, see Chapter 5.) 
Fortunately, the economic picture doesn’t change quickly, so taking the tem-
perature of the economy, if you will, can be a weekly or monthly exercise. 
Ultimately, maintaining a background knowledge of the cycles through which 
the economy is passing helps you identify current phases of the markets, 
which, in turn, can help you make better trading decisions.

 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
Knowing when monetary 
policy is your friend
Current interest rates and interest rate trends help determine the current 
position of the economy within the business cycle. Low interest rates are 
associated with economic troughs and high rates with economic peaks. In 
a nutshell, lower rates stimulate economic activity and higher rates slow it 
down. But the time lag between the interest rate change and any reaction by 
the economy often is a long one, making monetary policy an imprecise indi-
cator. Nevertheless, you can use interest rates to get a rough idea about the 
current economic landscape.
 
Interest rate reductions generally are good news for the stock market. The 
opposite also is true. When the monetary policy raises interest rates, stocks 
normally react poorly. Either way, stock markets may not react immediately, 
and unfortunately, many months can pass before either the stock market or 
the economy responds in either direction to the monetary action. Although 
the old stock market saying “three steps and a stumble” doesn’t always hold 
true, markets do often head lower after rates are raised for the third time.
In short, falling interest rates typically lead to a rising economy and to a 
market that’s changing from a bear market to a bull market — in other words, 
a bullish transition. Ultimately, a bullish transition leads to a new bull market. 
Conversely, however, rising interest rates sooner or later lead to a market 
that’s changing from a bull market to a bear market — a bearish transition, 
and ultimately a bear market. The problem: No consistent timetable exists 
that enables you to anticipate when these changes will occur, so you should 
use interest rate changes only as a hint that a transition may be coming and 
wait for an additional confirmation before you act on a trading strategy.
Keeping an eye on industrial production 
and capacity utilization
In addition to interest rates, industrial production and capacity utilization 
are other indicators that provide insight into the health of the economy.

Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
New economic growth is suggested when industrial production statistics 
start inching higher, a sign that usually indicates the market either is entering 
a bullish transition or will soon do so. Similarly, robust growth numbers often 
accompany a bull market phase. Conversely, levelling off or falling industrial 
production data show that a bearish transition can be expected. And finally, 
a bear market phase often accompanies falling production data.
Watching sector rotation
 
Monitoring leading and lagging economic sectors (see Chapter 5) provides 
direct insight into the current state of the stock market, because some indus-
tries tend to perform well at the beginning of an economic expansion and 
others tend to perform relatively well as the economy cools. Traders often try 
to anticipate changes in the economy by watching specific sectors that they 
know have tendencies to rise or fall in specific patterns that coincide with one 
economic or market cycle. These patterned tendencies are called sector rota-
tion. Although you won’t see picture-perfect sector rotation with every cycle, 
you will see enough similarities from cycle to cycle to enable you to gain addi-
tional insight into the current phase of the economy and the stock market.
Sectors that perform well during specific economic cycles and market phases 
are described in the following sections.
Anticipating a new bull market
Economic conditions that foster a new bull market include low interest rates 
and hints that industrial production is beginning to rise. Traders who moni-
tor these economic conditions often respond to them by buying the stocks of 
cyclical and technology-based companies. Bullish transition phases usually 
begin in this manner.
 
The stocks of companies whose business is sensitive to the economic cycle 
have traditionally been called cyclical stocks. Within the past few decades, 
technology-based companies have joined these so-called cyclical companies 
as bellwether economic indicators. The stocks of cyclical and technology-
based companies, and the companies themselves, perform best when interest 
rates are low. Increased sales of their products drive industrial produc-
tion numbers higher. These companies usually lead the market and often 
rally before an economic trough, or recession, completely bottoms out. 
Unfortunately, traders jump the gun as often as they get it right, so whenever 
you see cyclical and tech stocks begin to rally, it pays to be skeptical. Rather 
than jump to the conclusion that a sector rally means a bull market is just 
around the corner, instead consider that it potentially indicates only a bullish 
transition.

213
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
Industries known for making up cyclical sectors include
 
✓ Automobile and automotive component manufacturers
 
✓ Consumer durable manufacturers that produce products such as appli-
ances and consumer electronics
 
✓ Retailers, such as department stores, big-box discounters, and specialty 
retailers (excluding food, beverage, pharmaceutical, and other nondu-
rable retailers)
 
✓ Media companies, such as movie studios, radio and television compa-
nies, and book publishers
 
✓ Hotels, restaurants, and entertainment and other leisure companies
Watching the economy rebound
Strength in the industrial sectors is a condition that usually indicates the mar-
kets may be entering a bull market phase. As the economy begins showing 
signs of growth, we often see a rally in industrial sectors. Large industrial com-
panies often need to borrow money to increase production, a factor that makes 
them sensitive to interest rate changes. These companies tend to perform best 
in a low-interest-rate environment. Rising industrial production that drives 
industrial-sector earnings and stock prices higher is no coincidence.
Companies in the industrial sectors include
 
✓ Building products manufacturers
 
✓ Construction and engineering firms
 
✓ Aerospace and defence companies
 
✓ Electrical equipment manufacturers
 
✓ Airlines and air freight, transportation, and infrastructure companies
 
✓ Major manufacturing conglomerates (which are widely diversified 
companies such as Alberta’s ATCO, Ontario’s Onex Corp., GE, United 
Technologies, and Tyco before it split into three new companies 
during 2007)
Approaching a market top
When the economy is firing on all cylinders, industrial production is robust, 
and interest rates are beginning to rise. However, the stock market is trying 
to anticipate what happens next and it’s probably nearing its peak. The 
stocks of basic material, energy, and consumer staples companies tend to do 
well under these conditions. When you begin to see strength in the consumer 
staples sector, search for confirmation of a bearish transitional phase.

214
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Companies in the basic industry and materials sectors include
 
✓ Metals and mining companies
 
✓ Chemical companies
 
✓ Construction material companies
 
✓ Forest-product companies, including paper, packaging, and container 
companies
The energy sectors include
 
✓ Oil and natural gas exploration and drilling services
 
✓ Coal and coal processing
 
✓ Refineries
Companies in the consumer staple sectors include
 
✓ Food and beverage companies
 
✓ Household product companies and other consumer staples companies, 
such as personal-care product companies
 
✓ Retailers, specifically food, beverage, drug, and other nondurable goods 
retailers
Weathering a bear market
Healthcare and other service-sector stocks often perform better than the 
average stock as the economy peaks and as bullish market tendencies fade 
to bearish outlooks. The stocks of utility and financial companies also tend 
to perform better than average during bear markets, because they’re consid-
ered safe havens from the accompanying tide of rising interest rates and flat-
tening industrial production. As these stocks begin showing higher relative 
strength, it’s time to move your indicator from bearish transition to a bear 
market phase.
Consumer service sectors include
 
✓ Healthcare equipment and supplies companies
 
✓ Healthcare providers
 
✓ Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies

215
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
The utility sector includes
 
✓ Electric power generation and distribution companies
 
✓ Natural gas distribution companies
 
✓ Water utilities companies
Companies in the financial sectors include
 
✓ Diversified financial service companies, including banks and investment 
dealers and mutual fund managers
 
✓ Insurance companies
 
Taking a relatively long point of view as you monitor the markets for sector 
rotation is a good idea. By that we mean you’re not interested in the day-by-
day ups and downs, but rather you’re trying to evaluate sector performance 
during periods of many weeks and even months. Remembering that bull mar-
kets tend to lift prices for all stocks is also important. So when you monitor 
sector performance, you try to find the sectors that are performing better 
than others. In bear markets, stocks that hold their values, for example, will 
outperform all stocks that have falling prices.
Finding the dominant trend
The idea is to own stocks during bull markets, and sell them, or short them 
(see Chapter 14), during bear markets. In other words, you want to trade with 
the dominant trend. The stock market tends to lead the economy, so using the 
market’s performance as your primary reference to find the dominant trend 
makes sense. Combining your analysis of the dominant market trend with the 
background knowledge you gained from analyzing interest rates, industrial 
production data, and sector rotation helps you refine the way you categorize 
the current phase of the market. That kind of refinement means your trad-
ing performance will improve when you can make trades with the dominant 
trend or market phase on your side.
Looking at weekly index charts
Only a handful of tools are needed to determine the dominant trend or phase of 
the market. We use two, the weekly charts of broad market indexes and the bull-
ish percent index, which is discussed in the next section. Significant changes in 
the markets happen slowly, and thus show up better in weekly charts than they 
do in daily charts, because insignificant changes are filtered out.

216
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
We typically monitor charts of the major indexes such as the S&P/TSX 
Composite Index, the S&P 500 (SPX), or the Nasdaq Composite Index 
(COMPX). Doing so makes visually identifying bull markets and bear markets 
easy. They appear as trends, exactly like the ones shown on the stock charts 
in Chapter 10. A bull market appears as a series of higher highs and higher 
lows on weekly index charts. A bear market appears as a series of lower 
highs and lower lows. These are the dominant trends.
Pullback patterns, such as the flag, pennant, and other retracement patterns 
discussed in Chapter 10, correspond to the bullish pullback and bearish pull-
back conditions. And bullish transition and bearish transition phases may 
signal a trend reversal, in much the same way that reversal patterns and trad-
ing ranges often lead to a change in direction.
Figure 13-1 shows the phases of a bull market using a weekly chart of the 
Nasdaq Composite Index. Figure 13-2 shows the phases of a bear market 
using an earlier weekly chart of the Nasdaq Composite Index.

 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
Trend identification tools that we discuss in Chapters 9, 10, and 11 all apply 
to these weekly charts. For example, you can easily spot the higher highs 
and higher lows in Figure 13-1 that occurred in late 2006. These higher 
highs and higher lows correspond to a bull market. You also can easily see 
the lower highs and lower lows in Figure 13-2; they accompanied the long-
running bear market.
You also need to be able to identify the moving average convergence 
divergence (MACD) crossover points and divergent patterns on these 
charts. We describe MACD in detail in Chapter 11. MACD signals provide 
you with additional information to augment the way you categorize current 
phases of the market.
Using MACD to indicate bull and bear markets is straightforward.
 
✓ A bull market is indicated when the MACD line is greater than the zero 
line and greater than the trigger line.
 
✓ A bear market is indicated when the MACD line is less than the zero line 
and less than the trigger line.

However, pullback and transition phases are not as clearly defined:
 
✓ Either a bullish transition — or a bearish pullback — is indicated when the 
MACD line is less than the zero line and it crosses above the trigger line.
 
✓ Either a bearish transition — or a bullish pullback — is indicated when the 
MACD is greater than the zero line and it crosses below the trigger line.
Use the bullish percent index, described in the next section, in conjunction 
with pattern analysis, as described in Chapter 10, to help distinguish between 
the transition and pullback phases.
Using Figure 13-2, you can see where the MACD indicator on the weekly chart 
is less than zero and crosses above its trigger line. When the MACD crossed 
above its trigger line, it suggested the market may have been trying to turn 
from a bear market to a bull market in a bullish transition phase. You can 
see two instances in Figure 13-2 where the MACD signalled these bearish 
pullbacks or bullish transitions in 2008. Both failed, resulting in a dramatic 
continuation of the bear market.
Using the bullish percent index
You can use the bullish percent index (BPI) to fine-tune and confirm trading 
signals you see on the weekly index charts. The BPI is a powerful indicator 
that shows the percentage of stocks that have generated buy signals com-
pared with the total number of stocks in a given index. This indicator origi-
nally was used to track all the stocks on the NYSE, but it also can be applied 
to any broad market index, including the S&P/TSX, S&P 500, the Nasdaq 
Composite, or even the more narrowly defined Nasdaq 100 and sector 
indexes. BPI provides fewer and better signals when evaluating larger groups 
of stocks.
The BPI is based on point-and-figure charts — probably the oldest and sim-
plest stock charting technique — and helps you evaluate the strength of the 
market as a whole. Calculating the BPI is a bit daunting, but fortunately, it’s 
published online. For example, you can find BPIs at StockCharts.com, where 
the current states of this indicator for the major indexes and several sector 
indexes are displayed and interpreted. See http://stockcharts.com/
symsearch/index.html?$BP for details.
As an indicator, BPI works a bit like an oscillator (see Chapter 11). It displays 
values ranging from 0 to 100 percent to identify oversold and overbought 
market conditions. For example, when fewer than 30 percent of all stocks are 
on a buy signal, the BPI shows that the market is oversold and ripe for turn-
around. When more than 70 percent of all stocks signal a buy, the BPI shows 
the market is overbought and ripe for a downturn.

219
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
However, like individual stocks, broad market indexes can remain over-
bought or oversold for extended periods of time, so by themselves BPI 
readings below 30 percent or above 70 percent don’t necessarily represent 
respective buy or sell signals. BPI can and does provide readings well above 
70 percent and well below 30 percent for extended periods of time.
 
Changes in BPI levels are triggered by reversal patterns. A 6 percent change 
in the stocks of a given index is required to trigger any changes (up or down) 
in the BPI. These reversal patterns are interpreted to describe the state of 
the market using six unique conditions that roughly correspond with the six 
phases of the market described in the introduction to this chapter. The six 
states of the BPI are
 
✓ Bull alert: Corresponds with the bullish transition phase. It’s triggered 
when the BPI is less than 30 percent and reverses direction when 6 per-
cent (or more) of all stocks change to buy signals.
 
✓ Bull confirmed: Corresponds with the bull market phase. When the BPI 
indicator forms a higher high, a bull market is confirmed.
 
✓ Bull correction: Corresponds with the bullish pullback phase. This 
condition occurs only after the BPI confirms a bull market and a mini-
mum of 6 percent of all stocks change from buy to sell signals. If the 
BPI is greater than 70 percent, this change may lead to a bear alert 
(that’s up next).
 
✓ Bear alert: Corresponds with the bearish transition phase. It’s triggered 
when the BPI is greater than 70 percent and reverses direction after 6 
percent of all stocks change to sell signals.
 
✓ Bear confirmed: Corresponds with the bear market phase. When the BPI 
indicator forms a lower low, a bear market is confirmed.
 
✓ Bear correction: Corresponds with the bearish pullback phase. This 
condition occurs only after the BPI confirms a bear market and at least 6 
percent of all stocks change from sell to buy signals. If BPI is less than 30 
percent, this change may lead to a bull alert.
 
Although BPI is not a leading indicator, it gives you a good feel for the overall 
health of the market. When used with broad-based indexes, the BPI doesn’t 
speak often. After all, over 1,800 stocks are traded on the NYSE. For the BPI to 
register a reversal, at least 6 percent (or approximately 112) of those stocks 
must change from a buy signal to a sell signal (or vice versa). Actually, the dis-
tinction’s a bit more subtle than that. A total of 112 more stocks must change 
to sell signals than are changing to buy signals for the index to change from 
bull confirmed to bull correction conditions.

220
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
The BPI for smaller stock indexes generates considerably more signals. A 6 
percent change on the Nasdaq 100 requires only a balance of six stocks to 
change from buy to sell signals. Although the BPI provides information about 
the condition of these smaller indexes, you must use the signals with care. 
We believe this indicator is best used with broader-based indexes such as the 
S&P/TSX Composite, the Nasdaq Composite, the NYSE, or the S&P 500.
Selecting Your Trading Stock
After you’ve identified the dominant trend, the leading and lagging sectors, 
and the current state of the business climate, it’s time to select stocks to 
trade. Beyond general market conditions, two factors drive a stock’s price 
higher or lower:
 
✓ The fundamental condition of a company’s business
 
✓ The technical condition of a company’s stock
We cover these topics in great detail in Parts II and III of this book, so in this 
section we highlight only a few important factors for you to consider when 
selecting your trading stock. On the fundamental side, earnings matter more 
than any other fundamental data. Traders pay particular attention to the rate 
of earnings growth as characterized by the earnings per share (EPS) growth 
rate. In general, the bigger the EPS growth rate, the better the stock price, 
and vice versa. Stocks without earnings often make very dangerous trading 
candidates for long-side trades. Although some special situations may merit 
your consideration, stocks without earnings carry a special risk. Any hint of 
unfavourable press sends the stock’s price reeling. Besides, the downside 
risk is simply too great for our taste.
Also consider the company’s size when selecting a trading candidate. 
Although small companies can and sometimes do return outsized trading 
profits, they also present problems for traders. Stocks of small companies 
usually are lightly traded, which makes them difficult to buy and even more 
difficult to sell. You can afford to be patient when entering a trade but not 
when exiting a position, especially when the stock hits your stop-loss price. 
Lightly traded shares make exiting a position difficult, because the price is 
likely to fall quickly and dramatically when many traders are trying to exit 
simultaneously. You’re bound to lose more of your precious trading capital 
(when selling) or spend more of it (when buying) than you intended.
On the technical side, you want to trade the strongest stocks in the strongest 
sectors. You want to enter positions in these high-relative-strength stocks as 
they break out of trading ranges or reversal patterns. And you want to hold 
them as long as they remain relatively strong compared with other stocks.

221
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
Trading Strategies
Categorizing the phases of the market enables you to adjust your trading 
strategies based on current market conditions. The idea: Trade aggressively 
when you’re confident in your market assessment, but protect your capital 
when you’re uncertain. In this section, we present strategies for dealing with 
various market phases.
Exchange-traded funds
Up to this point in the chapter we’ve mostly 
talked about trading individual stocks, but 
at times you may want to consider trading a 
basket of stocks. For example, say your indi-
cators all suggest a new bullish transition or 
bull market phase, but few, if any, stocks are 
showing reliable trading patterns. You want to 
enter the market with a small position to take 
advantage of these relatively early signals, but 
you can’t quite identify a good trading stock.
If that’s the case, you may want to try an 
exchange-traded index fund, known as an 
exchange-traded fund (ETF). An ETF is similar to 
an index mutual fund but is traded on the stock 
exchanges, just like shares. However, an ETF 
differs from a traditional mutual fund in several 
important ways. For example, an ETF order is 
filled at the price when the trade is executed, 
not at the end of the trading day like most mutual 
funds. Also, you can place your ETF order just 
like any other stock order. You may use market 
orders, limit orders, stop orders, and stop-limit 
orders. And, unlike a traditional mutual fund, 
you may short shares of an ETF. See Chapter 14 
for the mechanics of selling short.
ETFs are available for indexes such as the S&P/
TSX Composite, Nasdaq 100 (stock symbol 
QQQQ), the S&P 500 (stock symbol SPY), the 
Dow Jones Industrial Index, and even many 
narrowly focused stock sectors. Many brands 
of ETFs are on the market, and they go by 
names such as Select Sector SPDR (pro-
nounced “spider”), PowerShares, iShares, and 
so on. You need to stick with ETFs that trade in 
high volume. See www.sectorspdr.com or 
www.morningstar.com/Cover/ETF.
html for additional information on ETF trad-
ing volumes and on which stocks are included 
in each ETF. The world’s largest family of 
ETFs is found at www.ishares.ca through 
Barclays Global Investors. For ETFs with lever-
age and therefore a bit more horsepower, go 
to www.hapetfs.com. But be careful — 
more leverage means more risk.
After you identify, for example, a new bull-
ish transition, you may want to consider the 
Nasdaq 100 or the S&P 500, or perhaps other 
ETFs for cyclical and tech stocks. Doing so 
enables you to take a position in the market 
while continuing to search for stocks that meet 
your fundamental and technical criteria.

222
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Trading the bullish transition
When you first decide the market may be entering a bullish transition phase, 
use extreme caution when trading — at this phase of the market, your pri-
mary goal is preserving your capital. Your secondary goal is getting in on the 
bull market, if it materializes.
 
You may take new positions during a bullish transition but the situation is not 
urgent, so you can be selective. Take small, partial positions rather than full 
positions (check out the section “A hypothetical trading example”), by
 
✓ Identifying the strongest stocks in the strongest sectors
 
✓ Looking for trading-range breakouts and other reversal signals
Keep your stops very tight and honour them rigorously. Consider an ETF if 
you have difficulty finding individual stocks that meet your fundamental and 
technical criteria.
Trading in a bull market
In a bull market, your primary goal is to become fully invested. Your second-
ary goal is capital preservation. Emphasize establishing long positions in 
your trading. You shouldn’t take on new short positions. Buy breakouts and 
take full positions, because your goal is to be 100 percent, or fully, invested. 
If you have a margin account for leverage, now is the time to use it. (The 
mechanics of using a margin when trading are discussed in Chapter 14.) You 
may loosen your stops a bit, because doing so allows for more ebb and flow 
of higher highs and higher lows.
 
The most reliable bull market signals occur during the early part of a bull 
market — after a bullish transition rather than following a bullish pullback. 
You may want to adjust your strategy to be a bit less aggressive following 
later-stage bull market signals. For example, you may want to tighten your 
stops a bit, especially when you’re using margin for leverage.
Trading the bullish pullback
A bullish pullback is a consolidation phase within a bull market in which your 
trading strategy needs to continue looking for high-quality stocks that are 
breaking out of new or subsequent trading range bases. When you decide 
the market has entered a bullish pullback phase, you may want to tighten 
your stops and seriously consider hedging your positions by using options, 
especially when you’re using margin for leverage. Hedging is like buying 
insurance. In this case, put options can be purchased to protect most of your 

223
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
trading capital in case the market moves dramatically against you. The cost 
of hedging depends on the amount of protection you buy. Options are dis-
cussed in Chapter 18.
A bullish pullback is still a bull market, so you can continue taking full posi-
tions on breakouts but you need to be selective. Make sure that your new 
and existing positions are the best-performing stocks in the best-performing 
sectors. You need to become a bit more cautious when the particular bullish 
pullback isn’t the first to occur during the current bull market.
Trading the bearish transition
A bearish transition indicates the market may be transitioning from a bull 
market to a bear market. You react to a bearish transition by
 
✓ Tightening stops on all your open positions
 
✓ Monitoring your positions closely
 
✓ Honouring your stops rigorously
 
✓ Exiting any long position at the first sign of trouble
Also consider hedging long positions by using options, as discussed in 
Chapter 18. If you’re using margin for leverage, exiting failing positions 
quickly is even more important.
If you’re so inclined, you can begin looking for short sale candidates, but only 
nibble at these trades. If you plan to short, take small positions and keep your 
stops very tight. We discuss the mechanics of selling short in Chapter 14.
Trading in a bear market
 
When you’re certain a bear market has begun, don’t enter new long positions. 
Your open positions are likely to hit their stops and be closed, but for the 
ones that remain, tighten your stops and exit any existing long positions at the 
first sign of trouble. Hedge any remaining long positions with put options.
If you’re inclined to short stocks, a confirmed bear market is the time to do 
it. We discuss the mechanics of shorting stocks in Chapter 14. You may want 
to take full-sized short positions and become fully invested on the short side. 
(See the upcoming section “A hypothetical trading example” for an example 
of position sizing.) Note: A margin account is required for selling short. We 
rarely use margin for leverage when trading short, but if you’re going to do it, 
now’s the time.

224
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Trading the bearish pullback
A bearish pullback is a consolidation phase within a market that nevertheless 
remains a bear market. As such, a bearish pullback is not a good opportunity 
for taking new long positions. You need to tighten stops on existing short 
positions, and consider hedging these positions using call options, especially 
when you’re using margin for leverage. A bearish pullback is an opportunity 
to take short-side profits and enter additional short positions when you see 
new or subsequent downside breakout patterns (see Chapter 9). Confirm 
that new and existing short positions are the worst-performing stocks in the 
worst-performing sectors.
A hypothetical trading example
Here’s a hypothetical scenario. The market is trying to begin a new bull 
market by entering a bullish transition phase. At this time, your $100,000 
example portfolio is 100 percent in cash. Your goal: Establish ten positions 
by the height of the bull market, which means you plan to allocate $10,000 of 
your initial capital for each position.
When you begin seeing signs of a bullish transition, you’re likely to be champ-
ing at the bit to start taking positions, but you haven’t found stocks that fit 
your trading criteria. Still, you’d like to participate in the new bull market, 
and you’re willing to risk a small loss if the bull market doesn’t appear.
In this case, you may want to start by taking a small position, perhaps a 
half-sized $5,000 position, using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the broad 
market indexes and perhaps for a sector fund or two as they break out. For 
example, you can take a $5,000 half-sized position in the Nasdaq 100 index 
fund (QQQQ), with a similar commitment to the S&P 500 index fund (SPY), 
and similarly sized positions in the cyclical and technical sector ETF. In all, 
you’d have positions totalling $20,000, which is 20 percent of your capital, 
committed to the market. That kind of commitment is appropriate for a rela-
tively risky bullish transition phase.
As stocks break out of their trading-range patterns, you may add positions, but 
you need to continue taking small positions until you’re certain the market has 
changed to a bull market. You also need to set an upper limit to the amount of 
capital that you’re willing to commit during a bullish transition phase, perhaps 
no more than 40 percent or 50 percent of your total trading capital.

225
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
If market conditions turn to a bull market, you then can start taking full posi-
tions and become fully invested. You may also want to reallocate your posi-
tions from the ETFs into high-relative-strength leading stocks. If you plan to 
use margin as leverage, a bull market is the time to do it. In this case, you 
could leverage your $100,000 of trading capital into a portfolio of stocks and 
ETFs worth up to $200,000 or more as your portfolio grows (see Chapter 14 
for more about trading on margin). You can either add to existing positions 
or add new positions in leading stocks as they break out of trading-range pat-
terns. Whatever you decide, keep the number of positions small.
When the market consolidates into a bullish pullback phase, tighten your stops 
and consider hedging your positions. Doing so enables you to use your stops 
to get out of underperforming stocks. If you’re stopped out of a position, forget 
about it. If it’s a profitable trade, pay your taxes (unless you’re using a tax-
deferred account or your tax-free account) and be pleased with your profits. If 
you’re leveraged, you want to get out of your margined positions quickly when-
ever they move against you, so you don’t give up your profits.
During a bullish pullback, you must decide first whether to hedge the port-
folio, and then whether you want to hedge each individual position or the 
portfolio as a whole. In general, you’re probably concerned more about a 
marketwide downdraft than you are about a major stumble in any single posi-
tion. If that’s the case, then hedging the whole portfolio with index options 
makes sense. However, the larger the portfolio, the more sense it makes to 
hedge your individual positions.
As a bullish pullback reverts back to a bull market, reallocate your capital into 
the new leaders as they break out. After each bullish pullback, becoming a bit 
more conservative is prudent. For example, you may tighten your stops, use 
less leverage, or continue providing a hedge against a significant downdraft.
When the bull market transitions to a bear market, you need to exit your long 
positions when your stops are hit. You may continue to hold your positions 
as long as they’re not losing money, but don’t lose your bull market profits. If 
you want to sell short, the bear market is the time to do so.
Making profitable trades is significantly easier if you buy during bull markets 
and sell or sell short during bear markets. Subtleties, of course, may exist. You 
may, for example, take long positions in defensive stocks, such as utilities and 
financial companies, during bear markets. Some traders find it profitable to 
hold a two-sided portfolio, where the best-performing stocks are purchased 
and poorly performing stocks are simultaneously shorted, even during a raging 
bull market, but our advice is to keep it simple. Become proficient by trading 
with the dominant trend before trying to fine-tune your strategy.

You’ve picked your stock and you’re ready to enter a position. As long as 
you’re entering the position while the market is open, you have some 
flexibility in the way your order is entered and executed. However, if you 
cannot monitor the market during business hours, or if you’re entering your 
order after the market is closed, you need to be much more precise when 
placing your order and indicating the type of fill (or terms of the order) 
you’re willing to accept. Otherwise, you’re likely to run into a nasty surprise 
when you review your trade confirmation.
This chapter reviews available alternatives when you enter an order to buy, 
sell, or sell short, and examines how the choices you make can affect the 
trade. We also review margin requirements, discuss how trading affects your 
tax return, and identify situations in which you can run afoul of stock-trading 
regulations.
Entering and Exiting Your Trade
When it’s time to enter or exit a trade, you have to tell your discount broker 
or investment adviser what you want to do. To do that, you enter an order 
that tells the number of shares and the symbol (or at least the name) for 
the stock or security you’re planning to trade. Your order also specifies the 
type of transaction you’d like to execute and how you’d like to handle your 
transaction. See Chapter 2 for more about the types of orders available. We 
discuss your choices for instructing how to handle your order in this section.

Before entering your trade order, you’ll probably want to check for a stock 
quote. Ideally, your quote system provides information similar to that shown 
in Figure 14-1.

Understanding bid and ask
To understand the quote system, here’s a bit of background and a little his-
tory. When you come to the stock market to buy some shares, you need to 
see what price sellers of those shares are asking you to pay — that’s why the 
sell side is called the ask. When you come to the stock market to sell some 
shares, you need to see at what price buyers of those shares are bidding for 
your shares — hence the buy side is called the bid.
In the bad ol’ days each trader had a stockbroker, each stockbroker had a 
desk trader, each desk trader had a floor trader, and each floor trader had a 
market maker. So between a trader selling a stock and a trader buying a stock 
there were eight people all making a very good living. The market makers 
also kept the spread between their buying and selling prices way too wide. 
With the arrival of the Internet, many of those eight people are now driving 
taxis and waiting tables. Traders who agree on the price and volume at which 
they both want to trade the same stock no longer need all those intermediar-
ies. Traders themselves have effectively become the market makers by set-
ting the buying (bid) and selling (ask) prices themselves. Sometimes a market 
maker is needed to balance the buying and selling pressure when it gets out 
of hand. For most large capitalized public companies, their market makers 
are often spectators to the action.
 
A market order tells your broker to buy or sell at the current market price. This 
means that if you use a market order when buying, your order is likely to be 
filled at the ask price. When selling, your market order is likely to be filled at 
the bid price. Occasionally, your broker may be able to fill your order between 
the bid and ask prices — but never count on it, because it doesn’t happen very 
often. Your order can, however, become the highest bid or the lowest ask, if 
you use a limit order. A limit order specifies the highest price you’re willing to 
pay when buying or the lowest price you’re willing to accept when selling. If 
you place your limit order between the current bid and ask prices, your order 
becomes either the best bid price if you’re buying or the best asking price if 
you’re selling. Note: You run the risk of having your order not executed at all 
when using a limit order if the current market price moves away from your 
limit price. Also, the TSX, NYSE, and Nasdaq each handle this a little differently. 
Your investment adviser can help you sort through the details if you encounter 
problems. Your online discount broker might not be so patient.
Understanding the spread
The spread is the difference between the bid and ask prices. It’s sometimes 
referred to as the inside spread, which is the difference between the highest 
bid and the lowest ask. Back when stock prices were quoted in increments of 
eighths (12.5 cents) and quarters (25 cents), the minimum spread was either 
an eighth or a quarter. Today, with decimal pricing, the spreads tend to be 
tighter, and can be as low as a penny per share on actively traded stocks. 

230
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Many of us veteran traders are so pleased to see shares trading at prices 
ranging from $20 up to $200 with only a penny between bid and ask prices. 
Although the major exchanges do not support spreads less than one cent, the 
TSX and some ECNs (electronic communications networks; see Chapter 2) 
permit tighter spreads for a small number of securities. Canada was far 
quicker to adopt the very good idea of trading stocks priced in dollars and 
cents — unlike the New York Stock Exchange, which insisted on maintaining 
the units as one eighth of a dollar (and 1/16 and 1/32 and even 1/64, if you 
can believe it!).
 
When you place a limit order within the spread, so that your limit price is 
between the current bid and ask prices, your order will usually become either 
the best bid if you’re buying or the best ask if you’re selling. This approach 
makes sense whenever the spread is particularly wide and the price isn’t 
moving very fast. When the spread is narrow, the way it is in Figure 14-1, using 
a market order is probably best — that is, as long as the market is open and 
the stock is widely traded with lots of volume.
The biggest problem with trying to squeeze a profit out of the inside spread 
is that prices move. Remember that stock quotes are only snapshots of cur-
rent bid and ask prices. By the time your order reaches the market, these 
quotes can (and do) change. Even the fastest real-time quote systems lag a 
bit behind the market, so it’s possible that the limit order you just entered 
between the spread is now outside the spread and won’t be filled — and 
believe us when we say that can be disappointing.
Some markets, such as the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) and 
the so-called Pink Sheets, do not allow traders to go inside the spread. 
Ridiculously, market makers are still able to ensure the spread is their nice 
little profit centre.
Devising an effective order-entry strategy
During trading hours, you can be reasonably confident that a market order 
will be filled at or near current market prices. But if you’re like most people, 
you won’t spend all your time watching the market. As such, you need another 
strategy for entering and exiting positions. You can use one or more of several 
alternative approaches to better control the terms and prices that you’re will-
ing to accept when your orders are placed in the hope of getting filled.
Using limit orders
If you’re buying a stock, choose the maximum price you’re willing to pay, 
and then pay no more. That means you can’t use market orders to enter 
your positions. Instead, you can use limit orders, which enable you to set the 

231
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
highest price you’re willing to pay for a stock, making that your limit price. If 
you’re selling short, choose the lowest price at which you’re willing to sell, 
and set that as your limit price.
Limit orders are effective for opening a position, but are problematic for 
exiting a position. For example, if you need to exit your position because 
the breakout has failed (see Chapter 9), you simply need to exit the position 
without trying to finesse the price. Failed trades recover infrequently, and 
they often get worse. You have no reason to be patient when things are going 
against you.
Similarly, whenever you have a profitable trade and you’re trying to protect 
your profits, a limit order rarely is your best choice for exiting the position. 
You’re better off exiting the position by using either a market order or a stop 
order after you’ve identified a reversal pattern.
Using stop orders and stop-limit orders to enter a trade
Traders normally talk about using stops for exiting or trading out of a position, 
but stops are also effective for opening a position. If you identify the stock you 
want prior to an actual breakout, you can enter a buy stop at a price above the 
breakout point. These orders can be entered on a GTC (good ’til cancelled) 
basis, so that even if the trading range lasts a while, your order is poised to 
trigger a transaction whenever the breakout occurs. Most investment dealers 
and discount brokers prefer to use “open” orders, which are good for about 90 
days. The GTC status can be dangerous if not revisited often.
 
Most firms limit the length of time orders can remain open to 90 days, so 
make sure you know your firm’s GTC policies — and remember that Nasdaq 
doesn’t have any provisions for handling stop orders. If you’re trying to use 
stops when trading Nasdaq stocks, your broker or adviser has to provide the 
mechanism for triggering these trades when your stop price is hit. Make sure 
they can handle the stop orders you want to use.
 
The downside to this approach is obvious — you’re unable to confirm the 
breakout. If the breakout fails, and you’ve triggered a buy order on the break-
out, you now hold a position that’s losing money.
Although we generally recommend waiting a few days to confirm the break-
out, using this strategy at some times may be more appropriate than others. 
For example, if you’re convinced the market is in a bull market phase (as 
described in Chapter 13), the stock’s trading range is long and tight, and you 
can identify an obvious breakout, then entering a GTC buy stop order at a 
price that’s a bit higher than the breakout price is probably okay. However, 
you need to be much more tentative when the market is only in a bullish 

232
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
transition or pullback phase, or when you’re monitoring second and 
subsequent breakouts. When that’s the case, make sure the breakout is con-
firmed — that means the stock remains above its breakout price for a bullish 
breakout — within a few days before entering your order. If you have any 
doubt, wait for confirmation.
 
Another problem with this approach is that after the stop price is reached, 
your order is triggered and it becomes a market order to buy or sell. You’re 
in the exact situation you’d be in if you’d entered a market order while the 
market was closed. You have no control over the fill price after your stop is 
triggered.
For example, say the stock price gaps higher (Chapter 10) as it breaks out 
of its trading range and surpasses your stop price by two or three dollars. 
Your order is triggered and will likely be filled at a price that’s much higher 
than your stop price, and much higher than you had anticipated. If the stock 
price falls below your fill price, you’re now holding a losing position. The 
only way to avoid this problem is by using a stop-limit order, which means 
when your stop price triggers the release of your order, the order becomes 
a limit order rather than a market order and is filled only if the stock price 
pulls back below your limit price (see Chapter 2 for more on limit and market 
orders). Again, remember to confirm that your firm permits stop-limit orders 
on Nasdaq stocks.
You can also use a stop order or a stop-limit order to open a short position. 
You specify a sell stop or a sell stop-limit order, while designating your trade 
as a short sale. Again, you must confirm your firm supports these types of 
orders for Nasdaq stocks.
Using stop orders to exit positions
After your buy or sell order is filled, enter your stop-loss instructions. You 
need to protect your open positions and simultaneously stay clear of short-
term traders trying to run the stops. Running the stops is a little game played 
by short-term traders where they try to find and execute open stop orders 
before driving the stock price in the other direction. It can be very lucrative 
for them and infuriating — not to mention expensive — for you. You can 
try to avoid being run over when they’re running the stops by keeping your 
stop prices away from the most obvious location. For example, if a breakout 
occurs at $35.75, don’t put your stop-loss one cent below at $35.74. Move 
down a few cents, to $35.69, or even $35.63, to stay away from the obvious 
stop-loss spots. We discuss stop-loss measures, and the reasons for them, 
more fully in Chapter 12.

Level I, Level II, and TotalView data
The quote screen shown back in Figure 14-1 is called a Level I quote. The 
bid and ask prices, and their associated numbers of shares, give you a little 
insight into the current state of the market. However, a Level I quote won’t 
show you the full depth of the market or the number of traders and market 
makers currently participating in the market for any one stock. For that 
information you need a Level II quote or display, or its updated cousin, a 
TotalView display.
A Level II display shows all the outstanding bid and ask prices for a specific 
stock, the number of shares associated with each price, and the identifica-
tion of key market makers participating in the stock. Some Level II systems 
offer a display that consolidates onto a single quote screen all the outstand-
ing bid and ask quotes from all the exchanges, along with all the bid and ask 
quotes from the ECNs (electronic communications networks; see Chapter 2 
for details) where a stock trades. Figure 14-2 shows an example TotalView 
display for Apple Inc. (AAPL).

Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Although interesting, most of the information available on Level II or 
TotalView displays is unnecessary for a typical position trader. Unless you’re 
swing trading (see Chapter 16), day trading (see Chapter 17), or trading low-
volume stocks, you’re not likely to need a Level II or TotalView data feed.
Entering orders after the market 
closes: Be careful
As long as you’re entering your trades during market hours, using a market 
order is fine; however, if you’re planning to check your charts each evening 
and then enter your trades before heading to work in the morning, you must 
use a different approach. Otherwise, you risk having your orders filled at 
prices that can differ significantly from the previous closing prices. To make 
matters worse, you may discover that your position is losing money soon 
after being filled.
Don’t be surprised to discover that many traders trade this way. Because 
of their daily schedules, they analyze stock charts in the evening and enter 
orders before the markets open. Unfortunately, common breakout and rever-
sal patterns (see Chapter 9) cause many traders to react in a predicable 
fashion. When many traders enter buy orders for the same stock, a scarcity 
of that stock is likely to occur just after the market opens. Scarcity causes 
prices to rise, sometimes even dramatically, so that all those aftermarket 
orders are filled at prices significantly higher than the previous closing price. 
Making matters worse, after the buy orders are filled and buying pressure 
disappears, the stock price tumbles back toward the previous closing price.
Professional traders — including floor traders, market makers, day traders, 
and swing traders — exacerbate the problem even further. These short-term 
traders see the same fundamental and technical analysis signals that you see, 
and their goal is to profit from your enthusiasm, and perhaps your inexperi-
ence, as you try to open your position.
Another concern is automated algorithmic trading using computers pro-
grammed to enter orders like a robot. This is also known as high-frequency 
trading (HFT) or black box trading.
As a result, you need to think about the tactics these short-term traders 
employ before you enter any positions. When they see breakout or rever-
sal patterns, short-term traders anticipate a flurry of buying activity in that 
stock, and they know that few people are going to be eager sellers when a 
stock breaks out of a trading range. Under those circumstances, the only way 
buyers can get an order filled is if they bid the price higher or accept what-
ever price is being asked for the stock. When that happens, the best asking 
price is going to be relatively high.

235
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
Someone will sell the stock to position traders but only at a relatively high 
asking price. Short-term swing traders and day traders, who may not even 
own the stock, offer those asking prices, agreeing to provide the stock to 
the position traders as long as the buying pressure pushes the price of the 
stock upward. If the short-term traders don’t own the stock, they must sell 
the shares short — in other words, they must borrow the stock before selling 
(see the section “Selling Stocks Short”). After the short sellers absorb all that 
buying pressure the rally fades, the stock’s price falls back toward the break-
out price, and that’s when short-term traders buy the stock (at prices lower 
than they sold it). So, they can cover their short positions — or, in other 
words, return the shares they borrowed to sell at higher prices to the posi-
tion traders. How’s that for taking a quick profit?
This scenario is at the heart of why being patient usually makes sense. By 
steering clear of these moments of buying pressure, you’re more likely to get 
a much better fill, and you find out whether enough buying interest is pres-
ent to keep the stock price above the breakout price. Being patient doesn’t 
always work, of course. Sometimes buying pressure drives the price higher, 
forcing short sellers to cover at a loss, which in turn drives the price even 
higher, resulting in a runaway stock. When that does happen, you’ll probably 
be left standing on the platform, watching the runaway stock as it leaves you 
behind. Fortunately, runaway stocks don’t happen all that often. Thus, bank-
ing on runaway stocks is a poor tactic.
Our advice remains the same: Don’t chase these breakout and runaway 
stocks. When the cycle exhausts itself, as it ultimately must, the stock returns 
to a more rational price and you can reevaluate whether your position con-
tinues to make sense. As a position trader, you can afford to be patient.
Reviewing a week in the life of a trader
To help you get a feel for this, we’d like you to look at a sample trade made 
by a hypothetical position trader. The idea is to help you understand the 
rationale and the timing. As a position trader, your week begins during the 
weekend. You have a few things to accomplish:
 
✓ Evaluate the current state of the market.
 
✓ Evaluate the current state of your existing positions.
 
✓ Find potential replacement candidates for any failing positions.
 
✓ Find candidates for new trading positions.
We’ll use the week of December 8, 2008, as the example week.

236
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Before we begin, let’s recap the market’s recent performance. The broad 
market indexes peaked in October 2007. Stocks performed poorly over the 
next year, but they accelerated to the downside in September 2008.
From the October 2007 peak to the trough in November 2008, the S&P 500 
Index (SPX), like most broad-market indexes, lost over 50 percent of its value. 
This downtrend has also seen several short, sharp rallies. The most recent 
rally in November carried the SPX 20 percent higher over the span of five 
trading days.
Because the markets rallied 20 percent, the major media declared the bear 
market over. Rather than taking their word for it, we’ll use our analysis to see 
whether the persistent downtrend has ended.
The technical analysis indicators and fundamental economic conditions 
show a mixed picture:
 
✓ The economy is clearly in recession, possibly the worst economic condi-
tions in our lifetime.
 
✓ The Bank of Canada and the Fed lowered rates to their lowest point 
ever, near 0 percent.
 
✓ The consumer staples, utilities, and energy sectors are the best-perform-
ing sectors in the market. The sector rotation model (see Chapters 5 and 
13) suggests that strength in these sectors often occurs during bear mar-
kets, before reaching the bear-market trough.
 
✓ The weekly MACD indicator (Chapter 13) for both the Standard & Poor’s 
500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index is far below its zero line. 
Although the indicator has turned a little higher it remains below its trig-
ger line, suggesting that the market remains in a bear phase.
 
✓ The bullish percentage index (BPI, see Chapter 13) for all broad market 
indexes is signalling a bull confirmed condition.
Given the above factors you cannot conclude that a bull market has begun, 
as the major media are saying. Instead, the market is most likely in a bearish 
pullback, but you cannot rule out a bull market transition.
Next, you would analyze your current positions, if you have any. Given the 
recent volatility of the market, it would not be a surprise if you were stopped 
out of your short positions. And given your conclusion that the market is 
probably in a bearish pullback, you have not initiated any new long positions.
Finally, you look for new potential trading candidates. At the time, the news-
driven market was waiting for the federal governments’ decision about bail-
ing out the Canadian and U.S. auto industries. After the raft of bankruptcy 
announcements in the United States (including Linens ’n Things, Circuit City, 
and Lehman Brothers) it’s probably best to avoid individual stocks, at least 
until you see a clear indication of a new bull market. Instead, you’ll look at 

237
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
broad-market-index exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as sector ETFs, to 
find trading candidates.
You cannot be certain the market is in a bearish pullback; it might be in the 
beginning of a bull-market transition. Therefore, you decide to look for both 
long and short trading opportunities. For long positions, you look at the 
strongest sectors, including the consumer staples and utilities sectors. For 
short positions, you look to the weakest sectors such as financial stocks and 
real estate. You can also look at broad-market ETFs for both long and short 
trading candidates.
When you search the daily ETF charts it’s not surprising that you find few 
exhibiting a long-lasting trading range (Chapter 9). One that may qualify 
is the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU). You do find several patterns that 
might be attractive for short positions (Chapters 10 and 11). For example, 
you find the Short S&P 500 Proshare Fund (SH) recently made a new high and 
is in a pullback position. This fund’s price rises when the S&P 500 Index falls.
Your final step is to determine the breakout points and your entry prices 
(Chapter 9) for each of the trading candidates you’ve found. You may enter 
buy stop orders for these trades now, or you may monitor the situation and 
enter the trades as the trading signals occur.
During the trading week, your daily activities are comparatively easy. At the 
end of each trading day, you must
 
✓ Evaluate the current condition of any new or existing positions.
 
✓ Evaluate the current condition of any trading candidates you identified 
during your weekend analysis.
The markets gapped higher on Monday, December 8. The Utilities Selector 
Sector SPDR (XLU) also rallied, but did not break out of its trading range. In 
fact, it remained in this trading range for the entire week.
The price for the Short S&P Proshare Fund (SH), your short-side candidate, 
gapped lower at the open, and traded in a narrow range throughout the 
day on Monday. Over the next several days, trading in SH was within a very 
narrow range. Although this isn’t the classic breakout setup we discussed 
in Chapter 9, it is very similar. The 60-minute intraday chart for SH looks 
very much like a long-running trading range. The only difference is that this 
trading range is over a period of several days rather than several weeks or 
months. You decided that the SH trade was still viable, and you entered a 
buy-stop order at US$85.96, just above the high of intraday trading range. 
This trade was triggered during the day on Thursday, December 11.
Markets gapped lower the following morning, driving the price of SH higher. 
The opening price was the high price for the day. The ETF traded lower, and 
ultimately touched the top of the prior intraday trading range, but did not fall 
back into the trading range, at least not during the week we’re discussing.

238
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Because we are omniscient (or maybe it’s because we are writing this after 
the fact), we can tell you that this trade did not work out. During the follow-
ing week, SH fell back into the trading range and hit your stop price, giving 
you a 4.2 percent loss on this trade.
Selling Stocks Short
When you sell a stock short, you sell something you don’t have first and buy 
it later with a goal of profiting from a falling stock price. To sell a stock short, 
you borrow shares so that you can sell them in the open market. Your firm 
gets those shares either from its own inventory or, more likely, from other 
clients. The proceeds of that sale go into your account. To close that posi-
tion, you must buy the shares on the open market and return them to the 
firm. If the price you pay for the stock, or the buy-to-cover price, is less than 
your selling price, you’ve earned a profit on the short sale. Conversely, if the 
buy-to-cover price is higher, you’ve suffered a loss. Instead of buy low sell 
high, shorting is a case of sell high buy low.
Let’s say you borrow 100 shares of Company X and sell the shares short for 
$100. When the price drops to $80, you buy the shares back (you might also 
say you covered the shorted shares) and return them. You sold the stock for 
$100, and bought it back for $80, netting a profit of $20. It’s exactly the same 
profit as if you had purchased the stock for $80 first and sold it for $100 later. 
Conversely, say you borrow 100 shares of Company Y and sell them for $100. 
The stock price rises to $120, and you decide to cover your loss. You buy 
back the shares and pay $120, but you sold them for $100. You have lost $20 
on this trade.
Using open GTC orders cautiously
You, and you alone, are responsible for moni-
toring your open orders. It’s not uncommon for 
many stocks to break out almost simultane-
ously, so you need to be careful not to overcom-
mit. If by some fluke all your open orders trigger 
simultaneously, or within a short period of time, 
you must maintain enough purchasing power 
to adequately fund all your trades. Otherwise, 
your broker or adviser will call and demand that 
you pay for all those trades you inadvertently 
executed. Expect repercussions from your firm, 
including restrictions on your account, if you 
don’t send the money immediately.

239
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
Some of the quirks unique to selling stocks short include
 
✓ Paying dividends to the lender. If the stocks pay a dividend during the 
time a short seller holds a position, short sellers pay the dividends on the 
ex-dividend date to the owners who loaned them the stocks. Short sellers 
need to keep the ex-dividend date in mind whenever shorting stocks.
 
✓ Being forced to close a position. Whenever the original owner sells the 
stocks you borrowed, your broker can call away the shorted shares, 
which means you’re forced to return the borrowed shares by buying 
them on the open market at the current price. This happens rarely, and 
occurs only when no shares are available for shorting.
 
✓ Mandating the execution of short sales from only a margin account. 
Short sales must be executed in a margin account, because your firm 
loans you the stock to sell short, and charges you interest on any margin 
balance in the account.
 
✓ Paying margin maintenance requirements. Your firm can force you to 
close a short position if you’re unable to satisfy maintenance margin 
requirements.
 
✓ Having no or only minimal access to selling some stocks short. Lightly 
traded stocks may be unavailable for selling short, and when they can 
be sold short, they may be more likely to be called away (which hap-
pens when the original owner sells the stock you borrowed and you are 
unable to borrow additional shares).
 
✓ Restricting short sales on certain stocks. You can’t short a stock that’s 
less than $5 per share, and you can’t short initial public offerings (IPOs), 
usually for 30 days following the IPO. And, as we learned during the credit 
crisis, regulators can prohibit short selling on whole categories of stocks.
 
✓ Limiting short selling to only stocks without a downtick. The essence 
of the rule says you can’t sell a stock short in a falling market. Although 
implemented a bit differently on various exchanges, the result is the 
same. Short sellers cannot easily pile into a falling stock. You cannot sell 
a stock short on a downtick. It must be at the last sale price or an uptick.
 
One unusual aspect of shorting is that it creates future buying pressure. Every 
shorted sale must eventually be covered, and that means every share that’s 
been shorted has to be repurchased. Future buying pressure can cause the 
price of a heavily shorted stock to jump dramatically if all the short sellers 
simultaneously clamour to get out of their positions as the price rises, a situa-
tion called a short squeeze. You can find out how many others are shorting 
the stock by looking at short-interest statistics published twice monthly, effec-
tive the 15th and the end of each month by the Toronto Stock Exchange and 
available at www.tsx.com as well as the Financial Post www.financial
post.com/markets. American short positions are in Barron’s and Investor’s 
Business Daily near the end of each month. From those statistics, you get 
some idea whether your short position is likely to be squeezed.

Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Avoiding Regulatory Pitfalls
Several regulatory pitfalls may cause you problems as you trade. You want to 
avoid running afoul of these regulations. Otherwise, you risk having severe 
restrictions placed on your account.
Understanding trade settlement dates
The provincial securities commissions regulate when traders must settle 
their securities transactions. Stock trades, for example, settle three business 
days after a trade is executed, meaning the buyer must pay for stock trades 
and the seller must deliver the stock within three business days after the 
trade is executed. For example, if your trade date is Monday the trade settles 
Thursday, three business days after the trade date. Short sellers are subject 
to the same settlement regulations as everybody else. That means the short 
seller must deliver the borrowed shares to the buyer three business days fol-
lowing the trade.
Most securities, including mutual funds and bonds, settle in this three-day 
cycle. The shorthand for this settlement period is known as T+3, which 
means trade date plus three days. Stock options and government securities, on 
the other hand, settle the day following the trade date, or T+1.
Your firm may insist that the money for all trades be available in your 
account before allowing you to execute any trades. Firms can exercise this 
restriction because they’re permitted to set more stringent restrictions than 
regulations require. They can’t, however, set more lenient terms. Regardless 
of your firm’s restrictions, the trade settles during the period specified by 
government regulations. One consequence of this settlement cycle is that 
you are unlikely to withdraw funds that are part of the trade until the trade 
settles. However, you might be allowed to trade with those funds as though 
they are available as long as other trading regulations are not violated.
Avoiding free riding
 
Whenever you choose to trade in a cash account, you must take care to 
avoid free riding. Free riding occurs when you buy and sell a stock without 
depositing sufficient funds before settlement to pay for the transaction. For 
example, if you have $5,000 in your cash account and you buy 1,000 shares of 
a $10 stock, for a total transaction cost of $10,000, you receive a money call to 
deposit $5,000 to settle the trade. Of course, we ignored commission costs in 
this example.

241
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
One way a trader may mistakenly violate the free-riding rules is by trying to 
use the same capital on two transactions in a single day. Here’s the scenario: 
Say you have $10,000 of equity in your account, and you buy 1,000 shares of 
a $10 stock. Later that same day, you’re stopped out of the position. No prob-
lem so far. But if you try to reenter the position on the same day, then you 
receive a money call for the full price of the second trade. The bottom line: 
You can’t use the same capital to open two positions on the same day in a 
cash account. That’s free riding. Note, however, that these trades are permit-
ted in a margin account. Trading in a margin account means you’re not at risk 
of violating free-riding regulations.
 
If you fail to satisfy the money call within the specified time, your firm either 
issues a warning or places your account on restricted status. When you’re 
restricted, you have to have enough funds in your account to cover your trade 
before you execute your order. Restrictions usually are imposed for 90 days.
Avoiding margin calls and forced sales
Although trading on margin is very powerful, it’s also potentially very risky. 
You may recall from our discussion about differing types of accounts in 
Chapter 2 that a margin account enables you to borrow money which, in 
turn, permits you to leverage your trading capital. This leverage can improve 
your total return when things go well, but it can also amplify any losses when 
a trade goes against you. A margin account is required if you plan to sell 
stock short.
Before using your margin, you must become familiar with the rules governing 
its use. Refer to Chapter 3 for more about the use of margin.
Understanding margin fees
Your firm charges interest on the average daily margin balance regardless 
of whether it’s cash or stocks. The margin loan is an adjustable-rate loan for 
which the interest rate is based on the prime interest rate plus one or two 
percent. Firms usually quote their respective margin rates dependent upon 
the quality and the size of your loan.
Understanding margin collateral
Your trading positions represent the collateral used to secure your margin 
loan. Firms require the value of your collateral to be sufficient to cover any 
outstanding loan. The amount required, called the minimum maintenance 
margin, can range from 25 percent upward. In other words, your firm requires 
the equity in your account to be at least 25 percent of the market value of 
your margined stocks.

242
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
 
If the equity value of your account falls below the minimum maintenance 
margin, you receive a margin call, a demand from your discount broker or 
adviser to deposit more money or securities in your account. If you fail to sat-
isfy your firm’s demand for additional funds, you must liquidate some or all of 
your trading positions. In fact, your firm may even liquidate your positions 
before you satisfy the margin call, if the value of the equity in your account 
continues to fall. Falling stock prices mean falling equity values.
As an example, say you have $10,000 in your account, and you buy 1,000 shares 
of a $20 stock, which is $20,000 worth of stock. Current margin regulations 
require that you maintain a deposit of at least 50 percent of the value of that 
trade in your account to open the trade, and 25 percent of the total value of the 
position to maintain it. After purchasing the stock, your account has $10,000 of 
equity and $10,000 in a margin loan. A margin call occurs in our example when 
the price of the stock falls dramatically the next day from $20 to $12, represent-
ing a loss of 40 percent. At this point you still owe the $10,000 margin loan, but 
the total equity in your account now is only $2,000. The 25 percent minimum 
maintenance requirement is $3,000 (that’s 25 percent of $12,000, or 1,000 
shares at $12 each), so you’d receive a maintenance margin call to deposit 
$1,000 to bring your account up to the $3,000 minimum equity amount.
 
Notice in the example that you’re also dangerously close to owing more than 
the stock is worth. If the stock’s price falls much further, the firm likely will 
liquidate your position to satisfy your outstanding loan. Firms are allowed 
to liquidate your position at any time, without your explicit approval. In fact, 
they’re allowed to liquidate any position in your account to satisfy your loan.
This example illustrates the risks of using margin. The value of the stock fell 
40 percent in the example, but you lost 80 percent of your equity. Leverage 
cuts both ways. Earning double profits may be nice, but doubling your losses 
is very painful. Our recommendation is to never satisfy a margin call — close 
the offending position instead. In our example, you should have set stops so 
you’d be able to get out of the losing position long before you got the margin 
call. But after that margin call is generated, you need to liquidate the losing 
position(s) immediately to pay off the margin loan.
 
When you open a margin account you must sign a margin agreement, a bind-
ing agreement that explicitly entitles your discount broker or investment 
dealer to liquidate positions to satisfy outstanding margin loans. The margin 
agreement also permits your dealer to loan any stock in your margin account 
to another client to provide shares for that client to short the stock. When 
you short a stock, the shares of the stock that you sell must come from 
somewhere, and that somewhere is from other clients who own the stock. If 
you’re the one shorting stock, one “gotcha” can accompany this scenario. If 
the stock you borrowed is sold to someone else, then your discount broker 
or adviser can call away your short position in a forced sale. Although forced 
sales like this don’t happen very often, they nevertheless are a risk you must 
assume if you short stock.

 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
The Tax Man Cometh
Trading profits are taxable and half of net capital gains are usually taxed as 
income at the trader’s marginal income tax rate. Check out 78 Tax Tips For 
Canadians For Dummies by Christie Henderson, Brian Quinlan, and Suzanne 
Schultz (Wiley) for more info than most of us will ever need on the subject of 
taxes. Still, paying taxes is better than losing profits or principal.
One tax trap that snares traders is the superficial loss rule. Normally, you can 
deduct trading losses from trading gains before calculating your income tax 
burden. However, if you sell a stock for a loss and then repurchase the stock 
within 30 days, the trading loss cannot be deducted. Fortunately, the loss 
isn’t lost forever. You can use it to adjust the cost basis on the trade by the 
amount of the loss, which ultimately reduces the amount of tax owed when 
the position is finally closed. This adjustment effectively raises the cost of a 
stock purchase for tax purposes, so you owe less tax. A similar adjustment is 
available when selling short.

Trading System
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding discretionary and mechanical trading systems
▶ Identifying the tools and data required for system development and testing
▶ Understanding the pitfalls of system optimization
▶ Evaluating trading systems that you can buy
▶ Maintaining a trading log
A
trading system is a collection of technical and fundamental analyses 
tools woven together to generate buy and sell signals. Trading systems 
often are built using common indicators, oscillators, and moving averages 
(see Chapter 11). You can combine these various technical-analysis tools to 
create a virtually unlimited number of trading systems. For the new trader, 
the advantage to this approach is that you don’t need to invent something 
new to create and personalize a workable system.
The downside, however, is equally obvious. Many traders use these common 
tools and end up with a system that offers little competitive advantage and 
only modest (if any) profits. In addition, these systems can be difficult to use, 
because the signals of one trading system mirror the signals of many others, 
which makes entering and exiting positions troublesome.
Ultimately, you want to develop or adapt a trading system that closely fits 
your personality and trading objectives. This chapter helps you methodically 
develop and add to a trading approach that utilizes your own personalized 
repertoire of trading systems. It also helps you recognize and avoid destruc-
tive and costly habits that can sabotage your trading efforts. In addition, we 
discuss ways for you to evaluate some of the claims being made by trading 
systems that are for sale and whether buying someone else’s trading system 
makes sense.

246
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Understanding Trading Systems
Although individual trading systems differ in many ways, thinking about them 
on the basis of a couple of broad characteristics is helpful. The first charac-
teristic has to do with the two ways a trader interacts with the system. In this 
case, trading systems are one or the other of the following:
 
✓ Discretionary trading systems: A system that presents trading candi-
dates for your consideration, but leaves the final trade execution deci-
sion to you.
 
✓ Mechanical trading systems: A computer-based system that automati-
cally generates buy and sell signals that will always be traded.
The other way to categorize a trading system is by how it treats trends in the 
markets. In this case, trading systems are one or the other of the following:
 
✓ Trend-following trading systems: A system that tries to identify trade 
entry and exit points for new or existing trends.
 
✓ Countertrend trading systems: A system that tries to identify trade 
entry and exit points by finding tops and bottoms.
Although these categorizations are not mutually exclusive — discretionary 
and mechanical systems, for example, can both be trend-following systems — 
each approach has adherents and detractors. We discuss the strengths and 
weaknesses of each type of system in the sections that follow.
 
As you read through our descriptions of the trading systems, understand that 
no system generates profits without any losing trades. Put another way, no 
system works in every situation. Keep that firmly in mind when you’re devel-
oping ideas for and designing your personal trading system. Your goal needs 
to be designing a trading system that is useful to you across a large number 
of stocks and a large number of situations. Believe us when we say that you 
will run into trouble whenever you try to tailor a trading system to a specific 
stock. Additionally, try making your system work across long periods of time 
and across many different market conditions.
Discretionary systems
A discretionary trading system makes you an active participant in all phases 
of the trades you make and provides you with a great deal of leeway when 
making trading decisions. With this approach, evaluating the economic data, 
analyzing the broad market indexes, determining which sectors are showing 

247
 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
strength, and identifying high relative-strength stocks that are breaking out 
of long trading ranges and hoping to catch a new trend all are up to you. 
You make decisions based on what you see in charts and in fundamental 
economic data, and you enter and exit (buy and sell) positions based on that 
information.
 
A discretionary system requires a great deal of discipline, which can be a 
source of problems for some traders. This type of system works well for trad-
ers who are capable of making good decisions quickly under pressure. But 
discretionary systems may prove troublesome if you allow your emotions 
to wreak havoc with your ability to think clearly, act rationally, and make 
thoughtful trading decisions.
When emotions cloud your trading decisions, you may end up
 
✓ Overtrading
 
✓ Prematurely liquidating your positions
 
✓ Holding positions too long
 
✓ Anticipating trading signals in attempts to get better entry and exit 
prices
Another problem with discretionary systems is that they’re difficult to test, 
which probably is their greatest drawback. System testing is useful, because 
it helps you understand situations in which an indicator works well and in 
which it fails. With a discretionary system you can test the indicators, but 
you cannot reliably test your discretion.
Controlling your emotions is so important to being a successful investor 
that one of Canada’s largest mutual fund companies gave every investment 
adviser in the country a “stress control biofeedback card.” Even more high-
tech is the so-called EmoBracelet, developed by Royal Philips Electronics to 
limit the emotional response of traders. And the new “trader’s mood ring” 
was developed for Dutch bank ABN Amro, which is now owned by the gov-
ernments of the United Kingdom and Holland.
Mechanical systems
A mechanical system addresses some of the problems that arise when using 
discretionary systems. Mechanical systems usually are computer-based 
programs that automatically generate buy and sell signals based on techni-
cal and/or fundamental data. You’re expected to blindly follow the resulting 
trading signals. Some mechanical systems actually enter buy and sell orders 
directly into your account without your intervention.

248
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
 
If your greedy impulses or your fear of losing routinely cause you to make 
poor trading decisions, a mechanical system may be a better choice for you. 
An automated approach tends to reduce the stress and anxiety that arise 
when you have to make difficult decisions quickly. As such, you can make 
and execute trading decisions in a consistent, methodical way. A mechanical 
trading system also enables you to automatically include rigorous money 
management in your trading methodology.
Another benefit of the mechanical approach is having the ability to thoroughly 
test the system. Through testing you can confirm whether your trading system 
performs the way you expect it to and explore ways to improve your system 
before actually committing your trading capital. You can adjust and fine-tune 
your system after seeing the test results. Unfortunately, fine-tuning your 
system may lead to other problems. We discuss ways to avoid them in the 
“Identifying system optimization pitfalls” section later in this chapter.
Trend-following systems
Trend following is favoured by many technicians for one simple reason: Trends 
offer excellent opportunities for profit. Unfortunately, the popularity of the 
trend-following approach is one of its weaknesses. Too many of these systems 
generate many similar buy and sell signals, which in turn makes outperforming 
the average trader difficult for any individual trend-following trader.
Even the best trend-following systems have a relatively large percentage of 
failed trades, primarily because they depend on several extremely profitable 
trades to make up for the large percentage of losing trades. If your trend-
following system also is a discretionary system, your discretion (or lack of 
it) can cause you to miss a few of these profitable trades, and your overall 
results will suffer.
 
Trend-following systems typically are based on either moving averages or break-
out patterns (see Chapters 9 and 11). Moving average–based trading systems are 
the most popular and can be quite profitable; however, they work only when a 
stock is trending. These trading systems depend on long-lasting trends to gener-
ate enough profit to outweigh a relatively large number of losing trades. In fact, 
the number of losing trades can easily outnumber winning trades with this trad-
ing system. When a stock is range bound (stuck in a specific price range), a 
moving-average system generates a large number of losing trades. Because of the 
large overall number of trades, this system often is accompanied by relatively 
high transaction and slippage costs (see the section “Accounting for slippage”). 
Money management is critical when using a trend-following trading system.
You can make some adjustments to a trend-following system that may 
improve its performance. For example, you can insist that its trading signals 
be confirmed by another condition before actually entering any positions. If 

249
 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
your system triggers a buy signal, for example, you may want to see whether 
the signal remains in effect for at least a day or two before entering a posi-
tion. We show some examples of moving-average and breakout systems, 
along with some ideas to improve the performance of these systems, in the 
section “Developing and Testing Trading Systems.”
Countertrend systems
 
For many traders, the quest to find a profitable countertrend trading system is 
all-consuming. Countertrend systems appear desirable because their goal is to buy 
low and sell high. These systems try to identify inflection points, or the moments 
when stocks change direction, so traders can take positions close to when they 
occur. This approach may work in a few narrowly defined situations, such as in a 
trading range (Chapter 9) or a trend channel (Chapter 10), but it’s likely to fail in 
a spectacular and expensive way if attempted on a broader scale.
The vast majority of trading systems follow market trends. Trend-following 
systems tend to outperform countertrend systems, especially for position 
traders. Swing traders and some day traders sometimes use a countertrend 
approach, but even then they usually do so in conjunction with a trend-
following component.
Countertrend systems usually depend on oscillating indicators, reversal pat-
terns, and channelling strategies to find turning points. Some countertrend 
systems also are based on cycle theory, and others are based on volatility, 
expansion, and contraction. We briefly review some of these techniques in 
Chapter 16.
 
We discourage you from spending too much time evaluating countertrend sys-
tems, at least until you’re confident in your ability to use trend-following sys-
tems to successfully make your trades. Countertrend systems generate a large 
volume of trades, and the more you trade the more you spend on commis-
sions and fees, as well as bad fill prices known as slippage. These costs alone 
often swamp potentially profitable systems. Although a countertrend strategy 
can sometimes work profitably in a trading range or trend channel (Chapters 9 
and 10) it’s still risky, especially for a new trader.
Selecting System-Development Tools
Conceptually, you can use the back of an envelope to develop your trading-
system ideas. However, most traders want some way of confirming that their 
newly designed systems can perform profitably before they commit real trading 

250
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
capital. That means you need a way to test your system, which further means 
using computer software to precisely define the system and evaluate its per-
formance. Typically, this requires simulating trades by using historical data.
 
Regardless of whether you decide on a mechanical or a discretionary 
approach to trading, your system will benefit from testing. Although thor-
oughly testing a discretionary system is difficult, you can still test the com-
ponent indicators to learn when they do and don’t provide effective trading 
signals. To begin, you need a computer, development and testing software, 
and historical data.
Choosing system-development hardware
Doing the math that’s required when testing your system can really slow 
down your computer, and it can generate a lot of data. Almost any computer 
will do the job when you’re getting started, but if you end up testing many 
system ideas you definitely need a large amount of disk storage and a fast 
computer. The computer equipment required to run a proprietary trading 
platform, including products such as TradeStation or MetaStock, is usually 
enough for system development and testing. (See Chapter 4 for more infor-
mation about the hardware requirements for a typical proprietary trading 
platform.)
Selecting system-development software
Many trading system–development and testing products are on the market. 
Some proprietary trading platforms, such as TradeStation or MetaStock, 
include system-testing capabilities. Spreadsheet software, like Microsoft’s 
Excel, also is useful for analyzing simple trading systems and for analyzing 
the results generated by specialized development and testing software.
Trading system–development and testing software
You need to consider several of the following criteria when evaluating your 
system-development and testing software:
 
✓ All trading system–development and testing programs use some type 
of computer language to describe and test your system. Some are terse 
and difficult to use, others are more intuitive. Traders with strong com-
puter or programming skills have little problem mastering any of these 
languages, but others may struggle. Pay careful attention to this devel-
opment language before selecting a system. Be certain you’re actually 
able to use the system you choose.

251
 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
 
✓ You need to integrate your trading system with your stock charts. Some 
system-development software requires you to actually write computer code 
that enables you to display your trading system and stock charts simultane-
ously. Avoid these systems if you’re uncomfortable writing computer code.
 
✓ The manner and effectiveness by which your system-development and 
testing software reports on how your trading system is performing is 
critical. Some systems provide extremely detailed statistics about the 
performance of your trading systems. Others, however, list little more 
than the buy or sell signals. In general, more information is better.
 
✓ Make sure your system-development and testing programs are capable 
of exporting the data they generate, historical price data included, into a 
spreadsheet program for further analysis.
TradeStation is the gold-plated system-development platform. It has many 
built-in tools that make your development and testing job relatively easy. 
For those of you on tight budgets, one of the less-expensive alternatives you 
may want to consider is a charting and system-development program like 
AmiBroker (www.amibroker.com). Although flexible and powerful, AmiBroker 
isn’t as feature-rich or as polished as TradeStation, and it requires signifi-
cantly more effort on your part. For example, AmiBroker includes well-known 
technical-analysis indicators like moving averages and MACD (see Chapter 11), 
but the number of indicators included is a tiny subset compared with what 
TradeStation offers. Similarly, you have to use AmiBroker’s formula language to 
create and enter any other indicators that you may be using.
Spreadsheet software
 
A spreadsheet program is another invaluable testing and analysis tool. 
Although a spreadsheet program can’t do everything that a specialized 
system-development and testing program can do, it can add quite a bit of 
analysis horsepower to your system-development tool kit. You can actually 
code and test simple trading systems directly into the spreadsheet. You can 
also evaluate the results of your trading-system tests more thoroughly using 
the spreadsheet’s built-in statistical and analysis functions.
You can, for example, copy the price data for a stock into your spreadsheet, cal-
culate moving averages and other indicators, and then configure buy, sell, or sell-
short signals. You can also export trading signals from your system-development 
program and import the results into your spreadsheet for further analysis.
One of our favourite spreadsheet projects is calculating the maximum favour-
able and unfavourable moves after our system has triggered a buy or sell 
signal. Simple to do, and it helps you understand the strengths and weak-
nesses of your trading system in great detail. You can see whether problems 
with your trading system might be solved by using different exit procedures 
or tighter (or looser) stop-loss points.

252
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
For example, although your entry signals may show promise, your exit sig-
nals may be causing you to leave a lot of money on the table. These situa-
tions are hard to see when you’re working only with charts; however, they 
sometimes jump out when you’re working with raw data during your spread-
sheet analysis. You can find an example using this testing technique in the 
“Working with breakout trading systems” section in this chapter.
Some system-development programs provide a great deal of statistical analy-
sis, so choosing between spreadsheet tools and system-development tools is 
a trade-off between thoroughness and expediency. After you’ve been through 
the testing exercises a few times you get a feel for the strength of each 
approach. So it’s likely that you’ll decide to use both a system-development 
program and a spreadsheet program when creating and testing your new 
trading systems.
Finding historical data for system testing
When you need to test your system, you can, of course, test it in real time, 
with real money, and in the real markets. But getting some idea of how your 
system will perform before risking your hard-earned capital is usually better. 
Typically, that means testing your system by evaluating how it performs 
when simulating trading using historical price data. Around 10 to 20 years 
of historical end-of-day data for the indexes and stocks in which you plan 
to trade is usually more than enough to properly simulate trades for testing 
your system.
Many sources can provide the data. You can download historical data from 
the Internet, and some data are available online free of charge. Some propri-
etary trading platforms likewise include access to historical data. You may 
want to get data from more than one source to confirm its accuracy.
Yahoo Finance provides free historical data and permits you to download the 
data into a spreadsheet. To access the Yahoo data feed, get a quote for the 
stock and select “Historical Data” under the Quotes menu item. Then click 
“Download to Spreadsheet.”
Many online services offer data in a more convenient format, but for a price. 
Some sell historical data recorded on CDs. Sources for intraday price data 
also are available. Here are the URLs for a few of the many sites offering vari-
ous forms of historical data:

Developing and Testing Trading Systems
The ideas that you may want to include in your system development and test-
ing are virtually limitless. Many new traders begin system testing by combin-
ing a few off-the-shelf indicators in an effort to obtain better trading results. 
Doing so is as good a place as any to begin.
 
However, we want to caution you to keep your systems simple enough that 
you can understand not only the system but also the result. Simplicity usually 
is better when trading, especially when you’re first becoming familiar with the 
processes of system development and testing. We describe the process by 
looking at a couple of examples in the sections that follow.
Working with trend-following systemsMany trend-following systems use a 
moving average for their starting points. In this trend-following example the 
system is designed for position trading, which means we use a relatively long 
moving average. Short-selling won’t be permitted with this simple system.
The first step is defining buy and sell rules for your initial testing. The actual 
code for defining these rules depends on your specific system-development 
package. Therefore, trading rules are described as generally as possible. The 
rules for an initial test may look like this:
 
✓ Buy at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s price crosses and closes 
above the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA).
 
✓ Sell at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s price crosses and closes 
below the 50-day EMA.
To test whether using a moving average as a starting point is a good idea 
in a trend-following system, apply these two rules to ten years of historical 
data for the stock or stocks of your choice. After testing this idea, you find 

254
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
that this simple system works fairly well when stock prices are trending, but 
it’s likely to trigger many losing trades when the prices of stocks are range 
bound. You can try to avoid these losing trades, and possibly improve your 
overall trading results, by filtering out trading-range situations. One way to 
accomplish that goal is by changing the buy rule to read: Buy at tomorrow’s 
open when the following conditions are true:
 
✓ Today’s closing price is above the 50-day EMA.
 
✓ The stock crossed above the 50-day EMA sometime during the last 5 
days.
 
✓ Today’s 50-day EMA is greater than the 50-day EMA from 5 days ago.
These added conditions serve as signal confirmation. When you test these 
rules you find they reduce the number of whipsaw trades for most stocks, 
but they’re also likely to delay buy and sell signals on profitable trades and 
thus usually result in smaller profits on those trades. Yet this adjustment 
makes the overall system more profitable, because the number of losses is 
reduced.
You can find out whether other changes to your simple system actually can 
improve profitability. You may, for example, test different types of moving 
averages. Try, for example, a simple moving average instead of an exponen-
tial moving average (see Chapter 11 for the types of moving averages). Or 
you may want to try using different time frames for your moving average, 
such as 9-day, 25-day, or 100-day moving averages.
Identifying system optimization pitfalls
Most system-development and testing software comes equipped with a pro-
vision for system optimization, which allows you to fine-tune the technical 
analysis tools used in your trading system. You can, for example, tell the 
system to find the time frame of the moving average that produces the high-
est profit for one stock, and then ask it to do the same thing for a different 
stock. Some systems enable you to test this factor simultaneously for many 
stocks.
 
Although something is alluring about using this approach, doing so is likely 
to cause you trouble. If you find, for example, that a 22-day moving aver-
age works best for one stock, a 37-day moving average works best for the 
next stock, and another stock performs best using a 74-day moving average, 
you’re going to run into problems. The set of circumstances leading to these 
optimized results won’t likely repeat in precisely the same way again. We can 
almost guarantee that whatever optimized parameters you may find for these 
moving averages won’t be the optimal choices when trading real capital.

 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
This is a simple example of a problem that is well-known to scientists and 
economists who build mathematic models to forecast future events. It’s 
called curve fitting, because you’re moulding your model to fit the historical 
data. You can expend quite a bit of effort fine-tuning a system to identify all 
the major trends and turning points in historical data for a particular stock, 
but that effort is not likely to result in future trading profits. In that case, your 
optimized system is more likely to cause a long string of losses rather than 
profits.
 
Testing a long moving average and comparing the results to a short moving 
average is fine, and so is testing a few points in between a long moving aver-
age and a short moving average. As long as you use this exercise to under-
stand why short moving averages work best for short-term trades and why 
longer moving averages work better for traders with longer trading horizons, 
you’ll be fine. Otherwise, you’re probably moving into the realm of curve fit-
ting and becoming frustrated with your actual trading results.
Testing with blind simulation
 
Blind simulation is a method for setting aside enough historical data so that 
you can test your system optimization results and avoid the problem of curve 
fitting. For example, you may test data from 1990 through 1999, and thus 
exclude data from 2000 through the present. After you’ve developed a system 
that looks good enough for you to base your trades on, you can then test your 
system against the data that were excluded. If the system performs as well 
with the excluded data as it did with the original test data, you may have a 
system worth trading. If it fails, you obviously need to rethink your system.
Another approach is choosing your historical data with extreme care. You 
can expect trend-following systems like a moving-average system to perform 
well during long, powerful trends. If your stock had a strong run-up during 
the long-lasting 1990s bull market, that kind of price data can skew your 
results, magically making any trend-following system appear profitable. 
Whether that success actually can be duplicated during a subsequent bull 
market, however, must first be thoroughly tested.
 
If the majority of your profits come from a single trade, or only a small number 
of trades, the system probably won’t perform well when you begin trading 
real money. You may want to address this problem by excluding periods from 
your test data when your stock was doing exceptionally well or when the 
results of any trades were significantly more profitable than the average trade. 
This technique is a valid approach to eliminating the extraordinary results 
arising from extraordinary situations in your historical data. Using it should 
give you a better idea of your system’s potential for generating real profits in 
the future.

Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Working with breakout trading systems
Similar to moving average–based systems, a breakout system can take many 
forms. You may already be familiar with the trading-range breakout system 
we describe in Chapter 10. To test a different approach, you can define a 
breakout system as follows:
 
✓ Buying at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s closing price is above 
the highest high price that occurred during the last 20 days.
 
✓ Selling at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s closing price is below 
the lowest low price that occurred over the last 20 days.
These trading rules are loosely based on the rules for Donchian channels 
(sometimes called price channels), which comprise a breakout system devel-
oped by Richard Donchian in the 1950s. Donchian was one of the early devel-
opers of trend-following trading systems.
A spreadsheet may be helpful for evaluating this system. You can, in fact, 
configure this system into a spreadsheet, include buy and sell signals, and 
perform analyses to determine how well the system performs. You also can 
use the spreadsheet to dig into the system’s results to find out what works 
and what doesn’t. Figure 15-1 shows an example.
Re-creating the spreadsheet in Figure 15-1 is straightforward. After you’ve 
downloaded the historical price data into a spreadsheet format, all you have 
to do is encode the formulas into the correct columns. We describe the for-
mulas in the sidebar “Creating the Donchian channel spreadsheet.”
If you’re like most traders, the first thing you’ll do is calculate some statistics 
about the system. For example, you can use spreadsheet functions to calcu-
late the following:
 
✓ Total gain or loss for the system
 
✓ Average gain (the numerical average)
 
✓ Median gain (the middle result)
 
✓ Maximum gain for any single trade
 
✓ Maximum loss for any single trade
 
✓ Standard deviation
Then you can look at aggregate results to find out whether the system actu-
ally made money. In the case of the Donchian channel breakout system, 
initial results don’t look promising. The system lost money during the entire 
test period.

If you’re like most traders, your impulse is to discard the idea and move on to 
another. But with the Donchian channel breakout system, you need to dig a 
little deeper before you do. During the time frame of this test, the system trig-
gered 30 trades, 18 of which were losing trades. However, 13 of those losing 
trades were profitable at some point during the process, and all the winning 
trades gave back a large part of the profits before the sell signal was trig-
gered. In fact, many of the profitable trades gave back significantly more than 
half of the profits before the sell signal.

258
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Figure 15-1 shows how a single position from the spreadsheet progressed. 
The entry trade was triggered when the price of QQQQ closed above the 
September 4 Donchian high. In this simulated trade, the stock was purchased 
at the September 5 opening price of $49.56 and then sold on November 9, the 
day after the price of QQQQ closed below the November 8 Donchian low.
If you look through the last three columns, you’ll notice that this simulated 
trade was profitable, but closed well below its most profitable price. If that 
happens once during simulated trading you may not need to worry much 
about it, but if it occurs frequently you need to think of ways to remedy the 
problem.
In the Donchian channel system, buy signals apparently work better than sell 
signals. Therefore, you need to consider different types of stops and sell sig-
nals. One simple idea that’s worth testing is stopping out (selling at a predeter-
mined price) of a position if the stock’s low (instead of its close) falls below the 
Donchian low. Another is to shorten the time frame for the exit signal by using 
a five- or ten-day Donchian channel. Or you can, for example, use a trailing stop 
or some completely different criteria to exit these positions.
Creating the Donchian channel spreadsheet
The opening, high, low, and closing prices for 
the QQQQ exchange-traded fund were copied 
into columns B through E of the spreadsheet 
found in Figure 15-1.
You need at least 20 rows worth of data before 
you can calculate the first Donchian price 
channels. (These first 20 rows are not shown 
in Figure 15-1.) The following calculations 
assume that column headers are in the first 
row, and the price data begin in the second 
row. After entering a formula in the following 
columns, copy the formula for that column to 
every row that has price data.
The remaining columns are configured as 
follows:
 ✓ Column F is the upper Donchian channel. 
Use the spreadsheet MAX function to find 
the highest price value for the previous 20 
trading days. Start this calculation in row 
22, giving 20 rows of data. The calculation 
for row 22, Column F is =MAX(C2:C21).
 
 Notice that the formula doesn’t include 
the current row. If it did, the current close 
would never cross above the Donchian 
channel line.
 ✓ Column G is the lower Donchian channel. 
Use the MIN function to find the lowest low 
for the previous trading day. Start this cal-
culation in row 22, using 20 rows of data. 
The calculation for row 22, column F is 
=MIN(D2:D21).
 
 As for the upper Donchian channel, the for-
mula does not include the current row.
 ✓ Column H is the Change Flag indicator. This 
flag is a simple way to avoid triggering more 
than one sequential buy or sell signal. It’s 
also useful for calculating the remaining 
cells. Simply stated, the cell displays either 
TRUE for a buy signal or FALSE for a sell 
signal. If yesterday’s close is greater than 
the Donchian high, turn on the TRUE con-
dition. If yesterday’s close is less than the 

259
 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
Donchian low, turn on the FALSE condition. 
Otherwise, copy the TRUE or FALSE condi-
tion from the previous day into this column.
 
 In row 22, column H, type the formula 
=FALSE(). Then, in row 23, column H, the 
formula is =IF(E22>F22,TRUE(),IF(E22<G22,
FALSE(),H22)).
 ✓ Column I is the Buy/Sell indicator. This 
column shows when a buy or sell signal first 
is triggered. It compares the current Change 
Flag value with the previous value. If they’re 
equal, a dash goes in the cell. Otherwise, 
the word “Buy” is shown when the Change 
Flag is TRUE and “Sell” is shown when it’s 
FALSE. The formula for row 23, column I is
=IF(H23=H22,”-”,IF(H23,”Buy”,”Sell”)).
 ✓ Column J is the Buy Price. This column 
shows the trade entry price. If the Buy/
Sell flag indicates a buy, then put today’s 
opening price in the cell. Remember the 
trading rule is to buy at the opening price 
on the day following the trade entry signal 
and sell at the opening price on the day fol-
lowing the trade exit signal. Therefore, the 
sell signal requires a special case. If the 
Change Flag indicator is TRUE for either 
today or the previous day (the special sell 
signal case), copy the trade price from 
the previous day to today. Otherwise, the 
Change Flag is FALSE, so leave the cell 
blank. The formula from row 23, column J is
=IF(I23=”Buy”,B23,IF(OR(H23,H22),J22,””)).
 ✓ Column K is the Gain/Loss indicator. This 
column shows a running total of the gain 
or loss in the trade, assuming the trade 
closes at the current opening price. The 
first row after a buy signal always shows 0 
percent. The last row following a sell signal 
is the actual gain or loss from the simulated 
trade. The formula from row 23, column K is
=IF(OR(H22,H23),(B23-J23)/J23,””).
 ✓ Column L is the MFE, which is short for 
Most Favourable Excursion. This column 
shows a running total of the best possible 
outcome for the trade as though it were 
closed at the high price of the day. This 
column is useful for what-if analyses but not 
for estimating your actual gains or losses. 
You rarely, if ever, sell at the high price for 
the day, or the MFE for a trade. The calcu-
lation is simple. If the Change Flag indica-
tor is TRUE, and if today’s high is greater 
than the purchase price, calculate the 
percentage gain. Otherwise, leave the cell 
blank. The formula from row 23, column L is
=IF(H23,IF(C23>J23,(C23-J23)/J23,””),””).
 ✓ Column M is the MAE, or Most Adverse 
Excursion. This column shows a running 
total of the worst possible outcome for 
the trade as though it were closed at the 
low for the day. This column is useful for 
what-if analyses but not for estimating 
actual gains or losses from the trade. You 
rarely, if ever, sell at the low price for the 
day, or at the MAE for a trade. The calcu-
lation is simple: If the Change Flag indica-
tor is TRUE, and if today’s low is less than 
the purchase price, calculate the percent-
age loss. Otherwise, leave the cell blank. 
The formula from row 23, column M is
=IF(H23,IF(D23<J23,(D23-J23)/J23,””),””).
Make sure you have copied the formulas in each 
column to every row that includes price data.
To evaluate the results, you can copy the trad-
ing signals, gain and loss values, and MFE and

analyze the data in any way you choose.

Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
In any case, this example gives you ideas about how you can use a spread-
sheet to test and analyze any trading system. It also provides you with some 
suggestions about how you can use this kind of analysis to improve your sys-
tem’s results.
Accounting for slippage
Slippage is the term traders use to describe the costs of trading, which is 
made up of two components. The first is the actual transaction or commis-
sion cost for executing your trade. The second is more difficult to measure, 
because it’s the sum of the cost of unfavourable fills. If, for example, you’re 
planning to buy at tomorrow’s opening price based on today’s closing price, 
those two prices can be much different. An unfavourable fill is a cost of trad-
ing, and accounted for as slippage.
Most trading system–development packages have a provision for estimating 
slippage costs when testing your trading ideas using historical data. If you 
know your transaction costs, enter the exact amounts. Otherwise, estimate 
the transaction cost. You probably need to overestimate the cost of unfavour-
able fills, because it always seems to end up being worse in actual trading than 
most traders ever imagine. You may want to start with an estimate of 25 cents 
per share and adjust it as you gather data on your actual slippage costs.
Keeping a Trading Journal
Keep track of all your trading activities in a trading journal. Doing so even-
tually turns your trading journal into a reference manual that can become 
an invaluable tool for helping you recall what you’ve done to identify what 
works and what doesn’t. A trading journal also can help you analyze your 
trades and trading systems to determine which aspects of trading you do 
well and which ones you need to work on.
When you develop a trading system, save ideas and test results in your jour-
nal. When you enter a position, record everything about the trade. Include 
your thoughts as you contemplate making the trade. When you have a what-
was-I-thinking moment later on, you can find the answer in your journal.
Using a loose-leaf binder to hold your trading journal is probably best. Print 
before and after charts for each trade and include them in the journal. Keep 
detailed notes about each trade, and about the system you used to trigger 
the trade. At a minimum, your notes need to include the following:
 
✓ Trade date
 
✓ Stock symbol

261
 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
 
✓ Number of shares, and why you chose that number of shares
 
✓ Whether you bought long or sold short
 
✓ Which system triggered the entry signal
 
✓ Which system triggered the exit signal
 
✓ Where you placed your initial stops
 
✓ If and why you moved your stops
 
✓ What caused you to exit the position and why
 
✓ Amount of tax to be paid on net gains
 
✓ Percentage gain or loss from the trade
 
✓ Amount of slippage
 
✓ Whether any economic reports or announcements were made around or 
during the time of the trade
 
✓ Your thoughts, hopes, and fears that you had before opening the posi-
tion and while the position was open
You can also use your journal to save magazine articles that influenced your 
thinking. Cut out and save the new high and new low lists from the newspa-
per. Keep a record showing leading and lagging industries. Save sector charts 
along with your trade records. Whatever information you use to make trading 
decisions needs to be in your trading journal.
 
You can improve only the things that you measure. Record statistics about 
your trades. Include the duration of each trade, the MFE, and the MAE. 
After you close a trade, write down what you might have done differently. 
Find out whether you can identify signals that can help you recognize similar 
situations in future trades.
Although keeping the journal is important, it is useful only when you review it 
regularly. Spend a little time every week or month reviewing all your trades, 
so you can pinpoint consistent mistakes or missed opportunities.
Evaluating Trading Systems for Hire
You’ll see advertisements on the Internet, in trade magazines, and in newspa-
pers for foolproof systems that promise amazing returns. Sometimes you’ll 
even see claims for systems that regularly return hundreds of percent with 
little or no risk.
Although some stocks do actually achieve astronomical returns of hundreds 
and sometimes thousands of percent, those cases are rare. Consider this: A 
system that offers profits of 100 percent per year supposedly grows $10,000 

262
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
into $10 million in only 10 years. Be skeptical. Experienced traders know 
that no system consistently returns 100 percent per year. (If you created 
such a system, would you sell it?)
As the Bernie Madoff scandal taught the world, it’s impossible to be involved 
in trading and not have a bad money-losing year on a regular basis. Those 
who were suspicious of Bernie Madoff’s US$65 billion scandal were tipped off 
because he never claimed enough money-losing years. Just make sure you 
don’t have too many money-losing years.
When evaluating these systems, the devil is in the details. Advertisements 
often are unclear about how a system actually works in real-world trading, 
and some vendors make claims based on nothing more than the results of 
system testing based only on simulated trades and historical data. In fact, the 
system’s author may never have traded the system using real capital.
Constructing a system that shows great profits when simulating trades with 
historical data is easy. If you designed a trend-following system and tested it 
against data during the period 1997 through 2000, or from 2003 through 2007, 
you can be fairly certain that the system is going to perform well in simulated 
testing. But that doesn’t mean you should use it to trade real money.
If a system sounds too good to be true, well, it probably is. So do your own 
homework. Find out what works and what doesn’t, and save your hard-
earned trading capital for trading.

S
wing trading is a trading strategy that tries to take advantage of short-term 
opportunities in the market. It occupies the middle ground between 
position trading and day trading. Swing traders use trend-following and 
countertrend strategies to participate in trading-range and trending stocks. 
This turbo-charged trading style requires an exceptional understanding of 
the inner workings of the markets and excellent analysis capabilities.
In this chapter, we discuss a few of the basic techniques used by swing 
traders along with the risks that are unique to the discipline. We also talk 
about tax issues and account restrictions unique to swing trading.
Stock Selection Is Key
 
Swing trading is a technical discipline. Although no hard and fast rule applies, 
swing traders often trade in 1,000-share increments and usually limit the 
number of simultaneous positions to ten or fewer. A swing trade can last for as 
little as a few hours to as long as a few months, but typical swing trades span 
no more than a few weeks. On this kind of time scale, fundamental analysis 
has little impact on a stock’s price movement; therefore, stock selections are 
made using technical analysis tools. Careful trade management is crucial to 
swing trading success.
Stock selection is even more important for swing trading than it is for position 
trading. When you’re looking for a stock to move right away, you base your 
decisions on selection criteria that are different from when you’re positioning 
for a move that may last for several weeks to several months. A few of the 
important selection criteria that swing traders use are

266
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
 
✓ Volume and liquidity: Swing traders typically focus on actively traded 
and relatively large stocks. The goal is finding stocks that are easy to 
buy, sell, and sell short. When trading time frames are short, you need 
to be able to execute your orders quickly. Unfortunately, stocks with 
the greatest liquidity and trading volumes are closely followed by the 
largest number of professional traders, which usually constrains the 
number of profitable swing trading opportunities, so swing traders often 
scout opportunities outside of the 25 or so stocks that have the highest 
trading volume and greatest liquidity.
 
✓ Trending: Trending stocks provide the best opportunity for swing-
trading profits. You may use either the methods described in Chapter 
9 for identifying trending stocks or the average directional index (ADX) 
indicator. This indicator has three components, the ADX reading, and 
two directional movement indicators — the +DMI and the –DMI. An ADX 
reading of more than 30 or so indicates a trending stock. A comparison 
of the two DMIs shows you whether the AMX is trending up or down. 
If the value of +DMI is larger than the value of –DMI, then the stock is 
trending higher. If the value of –DMI is larger than the value of +DMI, the 
stock is trending lower. The ADX indicator is included in most charting 
applications.
 
✓ Volatility: Swing traders depend on larger, or more volatile, short-term 
moves for profits. As a result, they want to trade stocks that have 
histories of making large moves in short periods of time. One popular 
approach to finding them is keeping an eye on the average daily ranges 
(ADRs, but not to be confused with American depository receipts, which 
are shares of foreign companies trading in the U.S. exchanges), which 
are simple moving averages that track the day-to-day differences 
between an individual stock’s daily high and low prices. If you’re swing 
trading, you want stocks that show high ADRs. Volatility also can be 
measured using historical volatility, which is discussed in the “Trading 
volatility” section.
 
✓ Sector selection: Just like position trading, swing traders try to trade 
stocks in the strongest sectors, and the weakest sectors are candidates 
for short sales. Use the techniques described in Chapter 13 to identify 
strong and weak sectors.
 
✓ Tight spreads: As a means of controlling slippage (see Chapter 15), 
you need to pay close attention to the difference between the bid and 
ask prices of the stocks you’re considering as swing-trading prospects. 
Stocks with wide spreads make profitable swing trading difficult. 
Low-priced stocks rarely are good candidates for swing trading, because 
the spread, as a percentage of the stock price, is usually too wide.

267
 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
Swing-Trading Strategies
Swing trading fluctuates between the use of trend-following and countertrend 
strategies:
 
✓ When a stock is trending strongly, swing traders primarily employ 
trend-following techniques, but may use countertrend techniques to 
fine-tune exit points.
 
✓ When a stock is range bound, swing traders use countertrend methods 
to identify entry and exit points.
Trading trending stocks
 
Technical analysis patterns that we cover in Chapters 9 through 13 are all 
applicable to swing trading. Patterns repeat in all time frames. The difference 
is in how swing traders use and interpret these common patterns. Trend-
following strategies are more aggressive for swing trading than they are for 
position trading. Although swing traders use some of the same indicators and 
patterns used by position traders, they often use them in different ways. We 
explain a few examples in the sections that follow.
Trading pullbacks
A pullback is another name for a consolidation within a trend. Consolidation 
patterns include the flags and pennants discussed in Chapter 10. Swing 
traders use daily charts and intraday charts — ranging from 1-minute bars 
to 60-minute bar charts — to identify the dominant short-term trend and any 
pullback patterns within the trend. They try to enter a position when the 
price of a targeted stock stops declining or pulling back, so they can capture 
the next move higher in the trend. Conceptually, pullback trading is simple, 
but in practice, it’s trickier than it sounds.
After you identify a trending stock and find a flag or pennant pullback pattern 
(Chapter 10) by visually examining the daily charts, you must try to enter a 
position just as the pullback is ending. The classic setup is finding an orderly 
pullback in which the high of each bar on a chart of the pullback is lower 
than the previous one. Figure 16-1 shows an idealized example of the type of 
pattern you’re trying to find.

268

Pullback
Entering a position is done by placing a buy-stop order. A buy-stop is like any 
stop order; when the price is hit, the order is executed. See Chapter 12 for 
details. Entering a position to trade pullbacks is an iterative process, so it’s 
best to use a day order instead of a GTC (good ’til cancelled; see Chapter 14) 
order. Here are the steps:
 
✓ Select your buy-stop price so it’s just above the intraday high price 
shown in the last bar of the chart.
 
✓ If the stock price trades above your buy-stop price, your order is 
executed. Otherwise, the order is cancelled at the end of the day.
 
✓ As long as you’re still interested in this trade, adjust your buy-stop price 
to just above the intraday high of the most recent bar on the chart and 
reenter your order.
 
✓ After your order is filled, place a stop-loss order (Chapter 12) using a 
stop price just below the intraday low of the lowest bar in the pullback 
on the chart.
 
✓ As long as the trade is active, continue adjusting the stop price to be 
just below the intraday low of the most recent bar on the chart.
Figure 16-2 is a price chart of the stock of National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV), 
which is showing a strong uptrend. Several opportunities for trading pullbacks 
are also shown on this chart.
The first pullback occurred after NOV traded to a new high of $30.44 on 
January 23, 2007. That new high is labelled Bar #1 on the chart. After 
identifying the pullback, you begin the iterative process of setting the 
buy-stop price just above the high of the last bar on the chart. At the end of 
each day, you reset the buy-stop price, again setting it just above the high of 
the last bar, and reenter the order.
In this example, the trade is triggered on Bar #2, which occurred January 30. 
You had set the buy price just above the January 29 high, which was $29.44. 
NOV opened January 30 at $28.90. The trade was triggered when the stock 
climbed above $29.45, rising as high as $30.01 before backing off to close at 

269
 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
$29.80. You could expect your order to fill very near your $29.45 buy-stop 
price. For the sake of our example, we’ll assume a fill price of $29.50.

Bar #1
Bar #3
Bar #5 Bar #7
Bar #2
Bar #4
Bar #6
Immediately following the trade execution, you set a stop-loss order below 
the low of the previous bar, $28.74 in this case. Or you may set the low at 
$28.90, the trade day’s low. Either approach makes sense, so it’s your call. 
Each day the trade remains active, reset the stop order just below the low of 
the previous bar on the chart.
The thrust of this trend lasted through February 12, 2007, a duration of ten 
trading days. This position hit the stop price on February 12, labelled Bar #3 
on the chart in Figure 16-2, when the stock traded below the February 9 low 
of $33.03.
The next opportunity to trade a pullback occurred during the pullback that 
began after NOV traded at a new high on February 13, labelled Bar #4. The 
trade was triggered on February 21, shown as Bar #5, when NOV traded 
above the February 20 high of $33.85. The position hit its stop price on 
February 27, shown as Bar #6, when the stock traded below the February 26 
low of $34.91. Given slippage and transaction costs, this trade was no better 
than a breakeven trade.
The next opportunity came following the poorly formed pullback that began 
with Bar #6. You entered the trade on Bar #7 when NOV traded above the 
February 28 intraday high of $35.00. The trade would stop out two bars later 
for a loss.

Swing trades don’t always work out, of course. Complications and frequent 
losing trades always are likely.
Surfing channels
Another trend-following approach to swing trading uses a channelling 
strategy to identify entry and exit points. Chapter 10 explains the channelling 
strategy and how to construct the channel lines. After a channel is identified 
on the daily charts, channel lines are treated as lines of support and resistance. 
Figure 16-3 shows an example.
 
Figure 16-3: 
Chart of 
Jacobs 
Engineering 
Group Inc. 
(JEC) in a

Resistance Channel Line
Support Channel Line
After identifying support and resistance levels for a channelling stock, you 
can monitor its chart for reversals near the channel lines. As the stock price 
approaches the lower or support channel line, you have an opportunity to 
take a position in the direction of the trend. After entering a position, your 
stop-loss order is entered just below the support channel line. As the stock 
price approaches the upper or resistance channel line, that signals when to 
exit your position.
 
You can use intraday charts to fine-tune this strategy. As a stock price falls 
toward its lower channel or support level, begin watching intraday charts for 
indications that the stock is changing direction and heading higher. If you see 
an intraday low near the location of the support channel line, followed by a 
higher high and a higher low, you can use that situation as an entry signal. 
After entering a long position, you place a stop-loss order just below the 
support channel line.

271
 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
You hold this long position until it either is stopped out or the stock 
approaches its upper channel resistance level. Again, you need to monitor the 
intraday charts for hints of a change in direction and exit the trade whenever 
you see the reversal. After that, you wait for the stock to head back toward 
the lower channel line to initiate a new long trade.
Trading range-bound stocks
Unlike the typical position trader, a swing trader is more likely to use 
countertrend strategies (see Chapter 15) and actively participate when a 
stock is range bound. The swing trader tries to make trades based on price 
movements from the bottom to the top of the range and back down again. 
You can use either daily or weekly charts to identify the trading range. An 
example using a daily chart is shown in Figure 16-4.
Your trading approach to range-bound stocks is similar to the one for 
trading a channelling stock that we describe in the previous “Surfing channels” 
section. As the stock price approaches the support level, which is just above 
$59.00 in Figure 16-4, you have an opportunity to take a position. You can use 
a few approaches to enter a position.
You can, for example, simply choose to place a buy order using a limit price 
just above the support line. Another approach that may give you a little more 
control and provide better entry and exit points is to monitor the stock to 
find pivot points as it trades near the support line. A pivot point is a three-bar 
pattern in which the low price of the middle bar is lower than the lows of the 
bars on either side of it. The entry and exit points for this kind of trading 
are similar to the ones used for trading based on a pullback pattern. After 
identifying a pivot point, you enter an order on the next bar. The protective 
stop is placed either immediately below the low of the pivot bar or just below 
the support channel line.
 
Using intraday charts is another way to fine-tune your entry point. As the 
stock approaches the support line, you enter a position as soon as you see 
a reversal pattern on the intraday charts — for example, a higher high and a 
higher low, or a gap higher (Chapter 10).
You exit these kinds of positions when the stock reverses near its resistance 
line. You can then take a short position in the stock — using any of the entry 
techniques described earlier — or wait for the stock to return to the support 
line to initiate another long position.
If the stock breaks through its upper resistance level, you interpret that 
condition exactly the way a position trader does — a very bullish indication 
that the stock is likely beginning a new trend, immediately closing any open 
short positions and converting to a trend-following strategy (see the earlier 
“Trading trending stocks” section).

Trading volatility
Swing traders try to trade stocks that move up and down more than average. 
To find these stocks, swing traders spend a great deal of effort measuring 
and analyzing volatility, usually in the form of historical volatility. Although 
the math required to calculate historical volatility is complex, the concept 
is simple. Historical volatility measures a stock’s price movement. The faster 
it moves, the higher the historical volatility. Fortunately, many charting and 
analysis programs include a method for calculating historical volatility, so 
you don’t have to program in the formula.
 
Historical volatility isn’t concerned with the direction of a stock’s price 
movement. A high historical volatility value doesn’t reveal whether a stock’s 
price is rising or falling. Although swing traders want to know that a stock 
trends in one direction or the other, they don’t really care which direction. 
Downside movement is just as attractive as upside movement to the swing 
trader.

273
 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
 
You can use historical volatility for swing trading in several different ways. 
One popular approach uses historical volatility for finding stocks that have 
been very volatile but currently are experiencing quiet periods. These 
temporarily quiet stocks often return to previous levels of historical volatility, 
and that presents a swing-trading opportunity. Swing traders identify these 
stocks by comparing measurements of historical volatility across longer and 
much shorter periods of time and expressing that comparison as a ratio. The 
ratio looks like this:
Swinging with Gann and Taylor
Swing trading has been around in one form or 
another since the earliest days of markets. The 
term itself probably originated with W. D. Gann 
when he invented the swing chart during the 
1920s. George Douglass Taylor popularized the 
phrase, and a short-term trading technique, 
when he introduced a now classic three-bar 
trading pattern in his 1950 book The Taylor 
Trading Technique.
Taylor’s ideas serve as the basis for much of 
today’s swing-trading methodology. According 
to Taylor, trending stocks tend to rally, then 
rest, and then continue to trend. Swing 
traders watch for these rest periods and 
attempt to enter the market just in advance of 
the thrust of the new trend.
Taylor’s method, sometimes called “the book 
trader’s method,” was originally developed to 
trade futures contracts in the grain markets. 
Taylor theorized that the market cycles through 
three distinct phases or days. The first phase 
is the buy day, the second is a sell day, and the 
third is a sell-short day. Although these three 
days don’t necessarily fall on consecutive 
days, for the sake of following the discussion 
we assume they do.
Taylor first determines the short-term trend, 
finds the position of the short-term cycle within 
the trend, and then uses this information to 
determine when to buy, sell, or sell short. The 
buy day begins the cycle. A typical buy day 
begins with weakness, and the trader takes 
a long position near a previously identified 
support level based on the weakness. This posi-
tion is held overnight into the next day, the sell 
day. The sell day typically opens strong, but 
the strength fades before the close. The trader 
sells at the early signs of weakness. The final 
day of the cycle is the sell-short day. The trader 
watches for any strength near resistance levels 
on the third day and sells short into this strength. 
The short position is held overnight and then 
covered during early weakness the following 
buy day. The cycle begins in earnest again with 
the trader initiating a long position after covering 
the short position.
Taylor’s approach is difficult to execute. Like all 
swing trading, it requires constant monitoring 
of the market and an excellent understanding of 
support and resistance levels. It is a discretionary 
approach that is difficult to test. Few stocks 
actually follow a three-day script on consecutive 
days. Many stocks trend for several days 
before pulling back or rising, so the three-bar 
method must be adjusted to account for these 
differences. Nevertheless, Taylor’s thinking 
is evident in much of today’s swing-trading 
methodology.

274
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Historical volatility ratio = Short-term historical volatility ÷ Long-term 
historical volatility
One common ratio compares a 6-day historical volatility with a 100-day 
historical volatility. Whenever the value of that ratio is less than 50 percent, 
the stock is a candidate for a swing-trading position.
After this stock takes a short low-volatility rest, it is likely to return to its 
historical level of volatility with a fast move. Remember that volatility tells 
you nothing about the direction of price movements, so to get around this 
limitation be sure to place buy and sell-short stop orders, respectively, above 
the high and below the low of the current bar. When the stock decides which 
way it will go, one of your stop orders will be filled and that should get you 
pointed in the right direction. Using more traditional technical analysis tools 
is another approach to evaluating a stock’s current trend, so you can then 
trade in the direction of that trend.
 
Risks accompany both approaches. Using the first approach, the stock may 
take off in one direction and quickly reverse course, and you may end up 
holding a position with a highly volatile stock heading the wrong way. This 
same scenario also can happen with the second approach. Another potential 
problem occurs when the stock price gaps through your entry order, and your 
order may end up getting filled at a price that’s significantly different than you 
expected.
Money management issues
Because of the short duration of each trade, swing trading generates a large 
volume of trades. Execution and slippage costs (Chapter 12) can be very 
high. Profits are relatively small when measured on each trade, so losses 
must be carefully controlled.
 
You need to adhere closely to the money management rules we discuss 
in Chapter 12. In addition, each swing trade must represent only a small 
percentage of your trading capital. Ten percent of your capital per trade is too 
much. Risking less than 5 percent — and perhaps as little as 2 percent — of 
your trading capital on any one swing trade is a more conservative approach. 
This approach is similar to the one used by professional traders. When profit 
potential is small don’t take big risks, or you won’t be a swing trader for long.

275
 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
Using Options for Swing Trading
Stock options can be used as substitutes for the underlying stocks when swing 
trading. A stock option is a limited-duration contract that grants the option 
buyer the right to either buy or sell a stock for a fixed price. The option seller, 
usually called the option writer or the option grantor, is granting the right to the 
option buyer to either buy or sell a specific stock for a fixed price.
Each option represents 100 shares. A call is an option to buy 100 shares of a 
specified stock. The call buyer is acquiring a limited duration right to buy 100 
shares from the option grantor at a fixed price, called the strike price. A put 
is an option to sell 100 shares. The put buyer is acquiring a limited duration 
right to sell 100 shares of a stock to the option grantor at the specified strike 
price. Options are discussed in more detail in Chapter 18.
You can, for example, substitute a call option for a long stock position or a 
put option for a short stock position. You realize any profits by selling the 
options outright, or you can exercise an option and take possession of the 
shares. Swing traders, however, are more likely to sell the option than 
exercise it.
Although using options as stock substitutes has several advantages, it also 
has risks of its own. The primary advantage: An option costs far less than 
the underlying stock, which enables you to limit your risk to the price of the 
option.
Each option is a substitute for 100 shares or 100 shares of an exchange-
traded fund. One call option, for example, gives you the ability to buy 100 
shares at a fixed price for a certain length of time. As an example, assume 
that the QQQQ exchange-traded fund is trading at $27.10 per share. At the 
time of the example, you can buy one call option with a $27 strike price for 
$2.26 per share, or a total of $226, before transaction costs. That one option 
enables you to buy 100 shares of QQQQ for $27 before the option expires.
Say that the option in this example has approximately six weeks before 
expiration. Your option position is therefore profitable as long as the QQQQ 
exchange-traded fund trades above $29.26 (excluding transaction costs) 
before the expiration date. (We determined the breakeven price by adding 
the $27 strike price to the $2.26 cost of the option, which totals $29.26.) Your 
risk is the price of the option. In other words, you can’t lose any more than 
$2.26 per share, or $226, on this trade.

276
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Unfortunately, option pricing is not as straightforward as stock pricing. 
The pricing example above is merely a snapshot that varies with changes 
in the price of the QQQQ exchange-traded fund. The following factors affect 
option prices:
 
✓ Options expire and their prices decay as the expiration date draws 
closer. This price decay is caused by the option’s falling time value.
 
✓ The prices of current-month options decay at faster rates than longer-
dated options.
 
✓ In percentage terms, out-of-the-money options often move at a faster rate 
than in-the-money options. (An option is said to be in-the-money if it has 
intrinsic value and out-of-the-money if it has no intrinsic value. For a call 
option, that means the price for the underlying stock is greater than the 
specified strike price. For a put, that means the price for the underlying 
stock is less than the strike price. See Chapter 18 for additional details.) 
Note: Trading options that are far out of the money is rarely a good 
strategy.
 
✓ Volatility is a component of option pricing. Option prices rise and fall as 
the volatility of the stock rises and falls.
 
✓ Except in a few unusual circumstances, an option’s price doesn’t move 
in lock step with the underlying stock’s price. If a stock moves $1, the 
option, in general, moves some amount less than $1. The more an option 
is in-the-money, the closer the change in an option’s price will be to the 
change in the underlying stock’s price.
Another factor to consider when substituting options for stocks is that the 
option’s spread, or the difference between the bid price and the ask price, is 
extremely wide when considered as a percentage of the option price.
Before you decide to substitute options for your stock trades, make sure 
you understand the option-pricing model. We discuss it in Chapter 18. 
And be careful you don’t overtrade with options. If you normally buy 100 
shares, then you need to buy only one option contract. Although the price 
of 10 option contracts may be attractive when compared with the price of 
the stock, 10 option contracts nevertheless represent 1,000. When buying 
options for 10 times the number of shares that you normally trade, you’re 
increasing your exposure to risk by a factor of 10.
 
When trading options, you can’t make money in as many ways as you can 
lose it. Being right on the stock’s direction but still losing money on an 
option trade is possible because of pricing issues. That’s why gaining an 
understanding of the option-pricing model is so important before you try to 
substitute an option for a stock. We discuss options more fully in Chapter 18.

 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
Getting a Grip on Swing-Trading Risks
Swing trading is risky and demands a great deal of time. As a swing trader, you 
must monitor the market during every trading hour. You also must be able to 
control your emotions so that you stay focused and trade within your plan.
Ask any swing trader; you’re likely to hear that strict adherence to money 
management reduces risk. The counterargument is that swing trading exposes 
a great deal of capital to risk but makes only small profits. Some traders 
are able to swing trade profitably, but you need to realize that the odds are 
stacked against you. Only you can decide whether it’s worth the effort.
Some argue that swing trading combines the worst aspects of position 
trading with the worst aspects of day trading. Like day trading, swing-trading 
profits are small and slippage costs are high. Swing-trading positions are 
held overnight, so swing traders can’t take advantage of the special margin 
provisions that are available to day traders who close all positions by the 
end of the trading day.
Tackling Taxes
Special tax treatment is available from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) 
for some traders. The benefits enable full-time traders to be taxed as a 
business rather than an investor, and that means you can deduct the cost 
of the computer hardware and software used for trading. You can also treat 
your home-office expenses, including the costs for data acquisition, as 
ordinary business expenses. Whenever possible within the law, traders 
should claim their trading gains as capital gains and trading losses as 
business losses. Consider this example from the CRA’s own Web site (www.
cra-arc.gc.ca): “Although an adventure or concern in the nature of trade 
is included in the definition of the term ‘business,’ it does not necessarily mean 
that a tax-payer who is engaged in an adventure or concern in the nature 
of trading is ‘carrying on’ a business.” Make sure you get good accounting 
advice, because the definitions are not as clear cut as you might think.

In This Chapter

▶ Assessing day-trading risks
D
ay traders enter and exit trading positions sometimes up to a hundred 
times within a single day. Day traders may even get into and out of a 
position within the span of only a minute or two.
Some players compare watching the charts and jumping quickly in and out of 
positions to the rapid-fire action and excitement of a video game. However, 
much more is at risk. Instead of merely losing a game, a bad move can mean 
the loss of your entire portfolio, or maybe even more. Yes, day traders 
sometimes end up in negative positions, owing money to the firms with 
which they’re trading. We explain how that can happen later in this chapter.
For now, you need to know that day traders rarely hold a stock overnight 
and that watching a computer screen for hours at a time is a critical part of 
the day for this high-stress type of trading. Although none of us is or ever 
has been or even wants to be a day trader, in this chapter we nevertheless 
explain how this type of high-risk trading works, give you some common 
strategies used by these types of traders, and show you the high levels of risk 
day traders face.
What Day Trading Is All About
Day traders try to fashion a career out of buying and selling stocks quickly 
throughout the day. A certain amount of day trading is critical to maintaining 
the liquidity of the stock market, because the techniques they use keep the 
market moving. They’re known as institutional day traders — specialists and 
market makers.

280
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Another name for day traders is algorithmic traders due to their trading huge 
volumes of stock for minute profits using mathematical formulae driven by 
computers.
Retail day traders, on the other hand, are a different bunch. They make 
dozens or even a hundred trades a day, but they also close out all their 
positions at the end of each day. Retail day traders use technological 
developments that first became available in the late 1990s to get in on the 
action that used to be the sole province of the institutional day traders.
Institutional day traders 
and market makers
Market makers, also known as specialists in the U.S., are part of the North 
American stock exchanges. All are members of an exchange either as an 
individual, a partnership, or part of a corporation. They’re responsible for 
making markets in certain exchange-traded securities, maintaining inventories 
of the securities for which they’re responsible, and making sure the market 
for those securities is orderly.
Market makers play a role in maintaining the liquidity and efficiency of TSX 
Venture Exchange and Nasdaq-listed stocks and stocks that are sold over the 
counter on Pink Sheets and not listed in a particular market. They’re usually 
part of a firm or bank that facilitates the buying and selling of stocks in these 
markets. A market maker must be ready to buy and sell stock on a regular 
and continual basis.
Specialists and market makers used to trade into and out of positions 
throughout the day, often executing orders in a matter of seconds. More 
recently, the high-frequency trading from algo traders has replaced the 
market makers. We discuss market makers in greater detail in Chapter 2.
Retail day traders
Retail day traders try to make money in a totally different way. The playing 
field of day trading opened for retail day traders in the late 1990s, when 
computer software was developed that enabled individual investors to 
have direct access to securities markets in ways that previously were 
technologically available only to licensed and registered professionals. We 
talk more about licensing and registration in Chapter 20.

281
 Chapter 17: The Basics of Day Trading
It’s all about access
Firms that promote day trading provide their customers with real-time links 
to the major stock markets, which gives them information not readily available 
to average retail investors. Firms also provide customers direct entry into 
their order-processing systems. This direct access enables day traders to 
send their orders to a particular market and to determine the order route — 
a task that only licensed professionals previously were able to accomplish. 
Although other online and traditional firms may provide real-time quotation 
information, they don’t offer their customers linkages to markets. Instead, 
some have preset algorithms that determine where a customer’s order is 
routed for execution, which may or may not be the cheapest way to go. 
Many times the algorithms are set based on trading agreements among firms 
without regard to cost-effectiveness.
Why does direct access matter so much? Speed and, again we say, speed! 
Systems that provide more and more direct access give day traders the 
opportunity to execute their trades within seconds. In addition, by using a 
more direct route, traders can choose bid or ask prices that look the best 
and fill their orders instantly.
Traders also can post bid or ask prices directly on an ECN, or cancel 
orders with the click of a button, all because they have direct access. When 
establishing a position using a limit order through a traditional discount 
broker, traders must fill out another ticket to cancel their trades — and 
under those circumstances they can’t know whether their orders have been 
filled until they receive a trade or cancel confirmation.
Day traders aren’t looking to make a large profit on one huge sale every day, 
but instead seek smaller profits on much more frequent changes in the 
positions they establish during the day. Mere seconds are critical when 
you’re trying to get in and out of a position, trying to make money on small 
stock price differences which, in trading lingo, translate to dollars in the 
nontrading world. Although swing traders and position traders seek profits 
of several dollars with each position they enter, day traders may exit their 
position after earning a profit of only a few cents. Traders usually buy or sell 
at least 1,000 shares at a time, so 25 cents translates into a $250 profit for 
every 1,000 shares traded. Note: In a matter of only one second, what looked 
like a good price to a day trader can be lost.
By controlling where their orders are sent, day traders also gain better 
control over the costs of their trades. One of the ways that some discount 
brokers make money on trades they execute for customers is charging a 
fee called a payment for order flow. These fees can be a penny or more per 
share, providing something of a kickback to the discount firm and enabling 
deep discount brokerages to charge smaller upfront commissions that barely 

282
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
cover the cost of their trades. Although online discount brokers send trades 
to particular markets or market makers through which they’ve established 
trading deals, day traders have the inside information to select the routes 
that give them the best prices.
Day-trading firms
In addition to direct access, day-trading firms provide (for a fee of course) 
their customers with training in how to participate in this rapid-fire, price-
sensitive buying and selling and then encourage their trainees to use their 
strategies and their software. These firms developed proprietary software 
and systems that day traders use to analyze and chart activity and execute 
orders. This software usually is available only at on-site trading facilities or 
downloadable to your computer rather than being used through Web sites.
 
Day trading through a Web site isn’t usually done, because the added seconds 
it takes to download price information and then send back an order are likely 
to result in the loss of your order to some other trader. Even when a trader 
has high-speed Internet access, too much time can be spent waiting for pages 
to load and sending orders. So to be successful, day traders need the instant 
access they get through proprietary software.
Settlement: No free rides
An official stock transaction is settled three business days after the date of 
the trade, meaning that day traders frequently are buying and selling stocks 
before their transactions are officially settled. Day traders can’t free ride, 
meaning they can’t buy a security and sell it an hour later without first having 
enough funds to cover the settlement of the initial trade. If a trader buys a 
stock or other security, he or she must have the funds to cover the initial 
trade even if the security is sold for a profit within the same day.
A margin account with leverage of four times excess equity is what enables 
day traders to get around this rule. To play within these rules, all the trader 
needs to have is sufficient cash to pay for the shares or sufficient reserve in 
his or her margin account. Firms can restrict use of margin funds for three 
days until a stock transaction is settled, but they’re not required to do so.
Before trading, be sure you understand the restrictions your firm imposes 
on margin accounts related to stock transaction settlements. The settlement 
time for options is the next business day, as opposed to the three-day waiting 
period for stocks. To trade using options, funds must be in the account 
before you place the trade or you’ll be stuck transferring funds around, 
which might add to the costs of your trading.

283
 Chapter 17: The Basics of Day Trading
Strategies for Successful Day Trading
As we mention throughout this chapter, day traders trade stocks in lots of 
1,000 shares or more, putting large portions of cash at risk with every trade. 
Although the profit potential is great, so is the risk of losing all your money 
and maybe even owing money if you use borrowed cash in your margin 
account.
 
Before you ever consider day trading, you need to understand the risks you’re 
taking and how to control them. Otherwise, money can flow out of your 
account very quickly. Studies show that it generally takes six months to learn 
how to be a successful day trader, and during that learning curve you can 
count on losing money. Success rates of day traders range from 10 percent to 
30 percent of those who try it. In other words, 70 percent to 90 percent of 
the people who attempt day trading don’t succeed and frequently end their 
day-trading careers in debt. We explain more about risks in the “Risks Are 
High; Rewards Can Be Too” section later in this chapter, but first we need to 
review some of the basic strategies that day traders use.
Technical needs
Number one on the list of things you need to become a day trader is a very 
good computer and Internet setup. They’re necessary for successful day 
trading. Most traders have two or more monitors with a PC built to handle 
a large number of data feeds at one time. Windows XP or Vista are the 
preferred operating systems of day traders, because most of the trading 
platforms are written for these environments and because they’re able to 
handle multiple monitors.
Daily computer maintenance is critical for day traders. Computer problems 
are the last thing you want to experience in the middle of your trading day, 
especially when buy positions are left open. You can lose a lot of money if 
you’re waiting for your computer to reboot and a trade goes sour. Traders 
recommend that you clear the cookies (files that Web sites send to your 
computer when you’re using them) from your Internet cache on a daily basis 
and that you defragment (reorganize your files so the computer runs more 
efficiently) your computer at least once a week.
Another key step is finding an Internet service provider (ISP) that is reliable 
and offers high-speed access to the Internet. Many traders have more than 
one ISP lined up, so they have a backup in case the first one goes down. 
Again, you don’t want to lose even mere seconds when you’re in the middle 
of your trading day, especially when you have open positions.

284
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Trading patterns
Day traders make use of patterns seen in technical analysis that are similar 
to the ones we discuss in Part III of this book. One common pattern that day 
traders look for is a price gap in a stock at the opening of the market. They 
find that prices usually move in the same direction as the opening price gap 
during the first few minutes the market is open and then the market tends 
to reverse and fill the gap (see Chapter 10). Trading that doesn’t fill the gap 
during the first five to ten minutes can signal a dominant trend for the day 
for that particular stock. Some traders watch this action to find their targets 
for the day and the directions they plan to play them. No consensus on this 
exists, of course. Others believe early market moves give false signals and 
that using those moves for planning your trading day can be dangerous.
Traders watch for many of the same patterns they find when looking for 
breakout signals and signs of reversals (see Chapter 10). The key difference 
is that a day trader looks for intraday signals, while longer-term traders 
format their charts for longer periods of time.
Scalping
Scalping basically means you move in and out of a position for a very limited 
profit in an extremely short time frame, usually just a few minutes or pos-
sibly only a few seconds. The scalper’s objective is to make profits of only 
fractions of a dollar on any given trade, rather than the several dollars’ profit 
that most traders seek. Day traders execute their trades in a much narrower 
time frame, so scalpers look for only 10 to 25 cents per share, hoping to make 
small gains as often as possible. When scalping with higher-priced ($100 or 
more per share) or faster-moving stocks, a dollar can be considered a scalp.
For most stocks, scalping doesn’t pay if you trade fewer than 1,000 shares. 
Here’s why: A 10-cent scalping profit on 1,000 shares is only $100, before 
paying transaction fees or commissions. Little profit will remain after fees 
and commissions if you’re trading fewer than 1,000 shares.
Trend traders
Not all day traders use the scalping technique. Some are trend traders. 
Instead of jumping in and out of a trade for a fraction of a dollar, they look 
for profits of at least one or two dollars and may stay in a position for 
minutes or even as long as an hour or two. Trend traders make fewer trades 

285
 Chapter 17: The Basics of Day Trading
than scalpers, but seek higher profits per trade and may trade in blocks of 
fewer than 1,000 shares because they can make a nice profit as trend traders 
with considerably less share volume. In fact, traders who look for more than 
a one-dollar profit sometimes hold a stock for several hours, unless the stock 
is high priced or its price is moving fast.
Risks Are High (Rewards Can Be, Too)
Reading about trading patterns and the high volume of stock trading, you’ve 
probably already figured out for yourself that the risks are high. Within a 
matter of minutes, trading in and out of stocks in 1,000-share blocks can be 
costly when a stock quickly moves in a direction you weren’t anticipating.
In fact, the U.S. Senate investigated the risks of day trading after a shooting 
spree at an on-site day-trading facility in Atlanta, Georgia, left nine people 
dead in July 1999. The shooter, Mark Barton, was a chemist before getting 
involved in day trading and losing $105,000 in just one month. He killed 
himself after the shooting spree.
U.S. Senate investigators found that the revenue of the 15 largest firms that 
specialize in day trading for 1999 was US$541.5 million, or 276 percent higher 
than their revenue in 1997. Profits went up by more than US$66 million, and 
by 1999 the 15 firms had opened 12,000 new accounts. Investigators also 
found that the 4,000 to 5,000 most active traders were borrowing huge sums 
of money and losing it. In that year traders paid an average of US$16 per 
trade and made an average of 29 trades per day. Using these statistics, 
investigators concluded that a trader needed to make more than US$111,000 
a year in stock market gains just to break even with that level of costs.
A second study, released in October 2006 by University of California 
professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, who looked at day traders on 
the Taiwan Stock Exchange, found that 82 percent of traders lost money. 
Some may profit most days, but end up in a losing position after calculating 
costs of operations.
Liquidity
To be considered liquid, a trader must have the ability to change holdings 
quickly into cash. Although you can see that a day trader must trade a large 
number of shares to make a profit, he or she must also have significant cash 
and securities in his or her account to be able to continue trading activities.

286
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Slippage
Slippage can cost day traders significantly if they’re not careful about how 
they execute their trades. Slippage relates to the difference between what 
you expect your exit or entry stock prices to be and what you actually end up 
paying for and getting out of that stock when your order is finally executed. 
Depending on the volatility of the market, a stock price sometimes can 
vary by as much as several cents from the time you see the stock quotation 
until the time your order is actually executed. Traders can control slippage 
with the right type of order. The three basic ways to enter a position are at 
market, with a stop order, or with a limit order. Day traders rarely use market 
orders, which means buying or selling a stock at the market price. Instead 
they use stop or limit orders to better control when their orders are filled 
and how much they pay for the stock. We discuss types of orders in Chapter 2.
 
Most traders recommend you never enter a position without immediately 
placing a stop-loss order at an exit price you decide is the most you’re willing to 
lose on a particular position. Although a stop order means that when a stock 
hits the exit price the order changes to a market order and may result in your 
selling the stock at less than that price, it nevertheless is safer than placing a 
limit order, which can mean you miss the exit point altogether and possibly 
lose even more. Stop-loss orders can cause some slippage, but you usually 
lose less with these types of orders than with limit orders. A limit order can be 
completely missed when your stock breaks into a downward trend, because 
the fall in price was too abrupt or rapid for it to be executed.
When buying stock traders use limit orders, because they place limits on the 
entry prices traders are willing to pay. Traders certainly don’t want to end up 
paying higher prices than they intend, which in turn raises the bar for making 
a profit higher than is reasonably possible to attain.
Trading costs
Trading costs vary significantly depending on the amount of trading you 
do or don’t do each month. The table below provides a breakdown of the 
commissions charged by one of the top day-trading firms.
Number of Trades per Month
Commissions
1 to 399
$9.95 per trade
400 to 999
$7.95 per trade
1,000 to 1,499
$5.95 per trade
1,500 plus
$2.95 per trade

287
 Chapter 17: The Basics of Day Trading
The cost of trading is the same whether you have Level I or Level II access 
(see Chapters 3 and 14 for information on Level I and Level II quoting 
alternatives). The number of trades you do will affect whether you have to 
pay for Level II access. To get Level II access for free, you must make at least 
20 trades per month; otherwise, the monthly fee for Level II access is $150. 
Options-trading fees are $9.95 per trade, plus $1.25 per contract. In addition 
to these fees, per-share charges can range from $0.002 per share to $0.01 per 
share, depending on the exchange on which you choose to trade. If your 
computer crashes or your Internet access goes down, phone orders can cost 
you $15 per trade.
So if you trade 30 times a day for 20 days a month, the number of your 
trades totals 600. At $7.95 per trade, your commission costs are $4,770 per 
month, and if you trade 1,000 shares with each trade, that adds up to a total 
of 600,000 shares per month. Even at the lowest per-share exchange cost 
of $0.002, that means an additional $1,200 in per-share charges. Thus, your 
monthly cost for this volume of trading would be $5,970.
In addition to these costs, many traders also pay for newsletters or join 
trading chat rooms that give them alerts for the best opportunities each 
day. These services can add another $200 to $250 to your monthly costs. So 
before you see even one penny of profit, your monthly outlay can be $6,170 
(that’s $74,040 annually). You can easily understand why so many day 
traders never see a profit for at least six months and why such a high 
percentage of day traders actually give up before their businesses turn 
profitable.
Taxes (of course)
 
On top of all these costs, you must consider taxes you’ll have to pay annually 
on half of your net capital gains at your current individual tax rate unless 
you’re trading in a tax-free or a tax-deferred account such as a Tax-Free 
Savings Account (TFSA) or Registered Retirement Savings Plan or Registered 
Retirement Income Fund accounts (RRSP/RRIF, respectively). If you trade in a 
taxable account, then the interest expense on any investment loan (known as 
margin) can be deducted from your income.
Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes
If the risks and costs don’t scare you away from day trading, you need to 
become familiar with some common mistakes that lead to failure for many 
day traders. Some traders talk about their more common mistakes, especially 
the ones that cost a lot of money while they were building their businesses. 
Here are some of the more serious mistakes new day traders make:

288
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
 
✓ Breaking stop-loss rules: When a stock starts dropping, newer, not yet 
disciplined traders tend to panic as their picks begin losing money, so 
they decide to hold the stock rather than exit when their initial stop-loss 
is reached. However, traders go broke using that strategy, because they 
don’t stop their losses as planned. You must set your exit prices based 
on your technical analysis for both losses and profits when you first buy 
the stock. Follow those rules mechanically when the target price is hit, 
and don’t let your emotions get in the way.
 
✓ Chasing trends: New traders who aren’t yet confident in the way they 
read patterns often wait to see confirmation that they’re right before 
they enter a position. That hesitation causes them to miss planned 
entry points and, if they’re right, can end up forcing them into buying 
at a stock price that’s higher than they intended when an upward 
trend is expected or selling at a lower price than they intended when 
a downward trend is expected. By missing intended entry prices, 
traders end up chasing the trends and finding that their original entry 
and exit points no longer are valid because many others already acted 
on the trend and the stock is no longer available at the planned prices. 
Experienced traders just walk away from that particular trade instead of 
getting caught up in trading points that don’t match technical analysis 
and thereby chasing a trend.
 
✓ Not waiting for the right trade: A new day trader must exhibit the 
patience required in waiting for the right trade to match what the 
technical analysis indicates. Experienced traders know to wait for the 
right timing instead of forcing a trade, entering at the wrong price, and 
overtrading their account.
 
✓ Not establishing set rules before the trading day begins: To avoid 
getting caught up in the emotions of a big win or loss, you need to 
decide your entry and exit points before the trading day begins and 
never deviate from them after the day begins. Experienced day traders 
know that you either focus on your trades or think about your rules. 
You don’t have time to do both, and trying to do so can be a recipe for 
disaster. Staying objective and following your rules is crucial to maintaining 
the control a day trader needs.
 
✓ Forgetting that fundamentals don’t always matter: New day traders get 
caught up in the idea that the company whose stock they’ve purchased 
is a good company and that when its stock loses ground, it’s therefore 
bound to head back up. Experienced traders know that how good the 
fundamentals look doesn’t matter and that when the market is selling 
down, even the price of a good stock goes down. Day traders must follow 
market signs and not worry about how good or bad the fundamentals of 
the company they’re trading may appear.

289
 Chapter 17: The Basics of Day Trading
 
✓ Averaging down: Although investors may average down, meaning they 
buy a stock and if the price goes down they buy even more shares 
believing that it’s a good stock that will recover, this technique doesn’t 
often work at all for day traders, and most experienced traders of every 
variety will tell you that using it is a fatal mistake. Day traders instead 
believe that you need to set a stop price and get out (called stopping 
out) of a losing stock and possibly reenter again at a lower price. Doing 
so gives you time to look objectively at what is happening with the stock 
and determine whether getting back in is worthwhile. Stopping out also 
is likely to cost you less than averaging down, and you won’t risk getting 
caught with a margin problem. Averaging down can tie up too much 
money that otherwise can be used for a more profitable trade with a 
different stock. The worst feeling, even for an experienced trader, occurs 
when a stock plunges far below the stop position, because deciding 
whether to take the large loss is difficult. In most cases, if you’re 
uncertain of your next move, experienced traders recommend you get 
out of the position before the situation grows worse or out of control.
 
✓ Not knowing when to take profits: New traders sometimes make the 
mistake of either taking profits too early or not taking profits at all. Both 
can result in unnecessary losses. Most of the time, indecision strikes 
when traders are afraid they’ll lose a profit if they hold it too long or 
miss a profit if they exit too soon. Just as with losses, exit points need to 
be determined before entering a position, and rules need to be followed. 
Remember that as a day trader you must focus either on your trade or 
on your rules. Day traders who move into and out of positions within 
seconds or minutes don’t have time to do both.
 
✓ Walking away from the computer with open positions: Experienced 
day traders never walk away from their computers when they still have 
an open position. Although we touch briefly on holding open positions 
overnight in the introduction to this chapter, this rule is even stricter. 
Because experienced day traders respond to price changes that occur in 
mere seconds or minutes, they definitely don’t want to be away from the 
screen while a position is still open.
 
Day trading is a high-risk career choice that you should consider only after 
doing a considerable amount of initial research, hunting down good 
resources for educating yourself about the risks and rewards, and finding all 
the techniques you need to use to day trade successfully. Even before you get 
started, be sure to check out the firms you’re planning to use as resources by 
calling up their disciplinary records and complaint histories through the OSC 
or provincial regulators. You’re putting a good deal of money at risk, so take 
the time to find out all you can before spending even that first dime.

T
raders can raise the bar on the leverage they’re allowed by opening the 
door to the derivatives markets. Derivatives are any financial instruments 
that derive their value from another financial security, which is called an 
underlier. The underliers are usually stocks, bonds, foreign currency, or 
commodities. The derivative buyer or seller doesn’t have to own the 
underlying security to trade derivatives.
You may unwittingly encounter derivatives if you trade those exchange-
traded funds (ETFs) that offer to return two or even three times the value 
of an underlying stock index. Those ETFs use derivatives to amplify the 
reward — and the risk. And you may recall that derivative trading, especially 
those derivatives tied to the value of underlying U.S. mortgage assets, 
exacerbated the mortgage mess that started the financial collapse of 2008 
around the world.
 
Derivatives traders use futures and options, which are the two most common 
types of derivatives, to make money in a highly risky venture. In this chapter, 
we introduce you to a variety of derivatives, how they’re traded, and the risks 
involved in trading futures and options. However, you need to seek additional 
training before jumping into this kind of trading. This is the rocket science of 
money.

Types of Derivatives: 
Futures and Options
Derivatives are marketable instruments that over time acquire and relinquish 
value based on an underlying asset (see the later section on “Options lingo”), 
including such commodities as coffee or soybeans, bonds, energy prices, 
and even stocks. They are commonly used by commercial and institutional 
organizations to hedge against the risks of financial losses suffered by the 
underlying assets that they hold. Buying or selling a derivative, for example, 
can minimize your financial loss when a major change occurs in the price of 
an asset that you own. Hedging is a popular tactic used by growers, producers, 
portfolio managers, and users of the commodities.
The two basic and most common types of derivatives are contracts for 
options and for futures. Traders buy and sell them as a way to speculate on 
the direction that the volatile prices of underlying assets will take farther 
down the road. If their hunches are right and the prices move in the directions 
they expect, traders can make a significant profit. If, on the other hand, 
they’re wrong, they can lose the amount they paid for the derivative — 
possibly even quite a bit more. Before we explain all the risks, we need to 
more accurately define futures and options.
Futures
Futures are legally binding contracts between two parties, one of whom 
agrees to buy and the other who agrees to sell an asset for a specific price at 
a specified time. The specific price is known as the strike price. The specified 
date is known as the settlement date. Futures were first used in the 18th century 
in Japan as a means of trading rice and silk, but they didn’t appear in our 
markets until the 1850s, when futures markets were developed for buying and 
selling commodities such as wheat, cotton, and corn.
Futures contracts are one of the most volatile trading instruments. Prices can 
change rapidly, causing traders to face sudden and sometimes huge losses 
or gains. Futures contracts are traded based on the prices of underlying 
commodities, indexes, bonds, and stocks. Most people who enter futures 
markets do not physically buy and sell the actual goods or underlying financial 
asset. A futures contract on pork bellies, for example, does not obligate you 
to fill your garage with bacon. Traders invest in futures contracts either to 
speculate on or to hedge the risks of the changing prices of the assets that 
they might or might not hold. A pig farmer uses a pork belly futures contract 
to hedge his swine breeding. A Saudi prince uses a pork belly futures contract 
to speculate on the price of bacon.

293
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
What’s your position?
When people talk about futures, they’re bound to say something about their 
positions. Here’s what they mean:
 
✓ Short positions: The party in the contract who agrees to deliver the 
commodity, stock, or bond holds a short position. Traders who take 
short positions are expecting the price of the underlying commodities to 
go down.
 
✓ Long positions: The party in the contract who agrees to buy the 
commodity, stock, or bond in a futures contract holds a long position 
on the security. Traders who buy long positions are expecting the price 
of the underlying commodities to go up.
Making money using futures
Traders can make money from trading futures on the daily movements of 
the markets for the underlying commodities, stocks, bonds, or currencies 
involved in the contracts they trade.
For example, typical futures contracts for wheat are signed between wheat 
farmers and bread producers. On one side of this contract, farmers agree to 
sell a specific amount of the wheat they grow at a specific price and a specified 
time, and on the other side, producers agree to pay that price for the contracted 
amount of wheat to be delivered to them by the specified time. Farmers benefit 
by ensuring they can get a specific price or income from their wheat, and bread 
producers benefit by knowing how much they have to pay for the wheat they 
need to make the bread that they, in turn, sell to earn a living.
The value of that futures contract is adjusted daily. Assuming the farmer 
agreed in February to sell 10,000 bushels of wheat to the bread maker at $4 
per bushel in July, and assuming that before the July settlement date the 
price of wheat rises to $5 per bushel, the farmer holding the futures contract 
has lost $1 per bushel of wheat, or $10,000. These types of price adjustments 
actually are calculated daily throughout the duration of the futures contract 
and that means the farmer’s or bread maker’s account is credited or debited 
as wheat prices fluctuate.
The farmer and bread maker will probably never actually exchange their 
goods. Instead, the obligations of the futures contract eventually are settled 
with cash. In this scenario, the bread maker will probably buy his wheat at 
the current price of $5 per bushel when he needs it, but because he speculated 
correctly on the price, it’s only really costing him $40,000 (instead of $50,000 
at the current market price) to buy the wheat. Although the bread maker 
pays $50,000 for 10,000 bushels of wheat, he has saved $10,000 because of 
the money he made on the wheat futures contract. The farmer, on the other 
hand, sells his wheat at $5 per bushel and gets $50,000 cash, but actually 
keeps only $40,000 because he has to cover his loss from the futures contract.

294
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
You can see from this example that futures contracts are actually financial 
positions. This financial position, or the buying and selling of futures contracts, 
is how traders speculate. If futures traders believe the price of wheat is 
rising, they buy futures contracts so they can benefit from the gain made by 
the price. But when the situation is reversed and the price of wheat drops 
to $3 per bushel, then the trader who buys can be on the losing side of that 
futures contract and be liable for a $10,000 loss. The cost of buying into a 
futures contract is called the premium paid for that contract, which is only 
a small percentage of the price of the actual commodity, stock, bond, or 
currency underlying the contract.
Commodities futures
People who buy commodities futures basically are agreeing to buy a certain 
amount of a commodity at a set price at a future date. Conversely, people 
who sell those same futures are agreeing to provide a certain amount of a 
commodity at the agreed-upon price by the agreed-upon time. Buyers or 
sellers can enter into futures contracts on many commodities, including farm 
products (pork bellies, wheat, corn, and soybeans), precious metals (gold, 
platinum, and silver), and many others.
Traders usually don’t get directly involved as buyers and sellers of the actual 
commodities, because they get out of their futures contracts before the 
underlying commodities ever change hands. Instead, they’re speculators, 
buying and/or selling futures contracts based on which way they think the 
commodity price is going to move. Speculation, as you know, is fraught with 
risk, and the reason the risk is so great is that a commodity contract controls 
a large amount of the commodity value compared with the relatively small 
price that it takes to buy or sell the contract. The result is extensive leverage, 
which means controlling a large position with only a small cash deposit. If the 
price moves in a direction that’s the opposite of what the trader anticipates, 
he or she may have to take a huge loss to get out of the contract.
Index futures
Index futures are based on the expected direction of the value of indexes 
like the S&P/TSX Composite Index and the S&P 500 index. They can be the 
riskiest types of futures. No underlying commodities, stocks, or bonds ever 
change hands with these futures contracts. Any differences in these contracts 
must be settled with good ol’ cold, hard cash. Leverage also is high on these 
types of futures. For example, the multiplier on the S&P/TSX 60 contract is 
$100 per each index point. A Dow Jones Industrial Average contract has a 
value that’s 25 times the value of the underlying DJIA Index.
Smaller index futures contracts, known collectively as e-minis, or mini futures, 
are targeted at individual traders. These minicontracts are available for 
indexes such as the S&P/TSX and the Nasdaq 100. Their respective individual 
values range from 5 times to 100 times those of the underlying indexes.

295
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
The Montreal Exchange (MX) — Canada’s oldest exchange, founded in 
1832 — has leadership in the financial derivatives market. It is the only 
foreign exchange authorized by the SEC to manage the technical operations 
of the Boston Option Exchange (BOX), of which it owns 51 percent. As 
well as the S&P/TSX Composite Index and the S&P/TSX 60, the Montreal 
Exchange also trades index futures in gold, energy, financials, and information 
technology sectors.
The S&P/TSX Composite mini futures contract, for example, is five times 
the value of the S&P/TSX Composite index. In other words, if a trader takes 
a position in the S&P/TSX Composite mini futures contract, every time the 
underlying S&P/TSX Composite index moves one point, the value of the S&P/
TSX Composite mini futures contract changes by $5. Another way to think 
about this is that for every .25 point, the value of the S&P/TSX Composite 
mini futures contract changes by 5 cents. If you take a long position in the 
S&P/TSX Composite mini futures contract when the underlying index is at 
1,000, and the index moves to 1,010, you have a $50 profit. The trader who 
took the other side of this trade, the short position, is in exactly the opposite 
position, losing $50.
Bond futures
The Montreal Exchange also offers bond futures based on the price of future 
delivery of a specific type of bond in a specific denomination at a specific 
interest rate on a specified date. Speculators basically are betting on whether 
the price of that bond goes up or down. Changes in interest rates have a 
big impact on the values of bonds. In general, when interest rates fall, bond 
prices go up, and when interest rates rise, bond prices go down. Speculators 
in bond futures basically enter positions based on whether interest rates will 
go up or down. For example, a speculator who thinks interest rates will go up 
sells contracts for the future delivery of bonds. If interest rates indeed go up 
as expected, the price for the underlying bonds goes down, and speculators 
can do one of two things:
 
✓ Buy the lower-priced bonds, and in turn earn a profit by selling them 
to the buyer to settle at the higher price named in the original futures 
contract.
 
✓ Close the contract to realize a profit.
Stock futures
Stock futures are contracts in which you agree to either deliver or purchase 
upon delivery 100 shares of a particular stock on or before a designated date 
in the future (known as the expiration date). For example, a trader who enters 
into a contract to buy 100 shares at $30 a share for a total of $3,000, and who 
expects the price of that stock to go up, can lock in the lower price and then 
buy the actual stock at that lower price on the settlement date or close the 

296
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
contract and realize a profit. Traders who enter into this type of contract 
generally must have about 20 percent of the cash value of 100 shares of the 
underlying stock in their futures accounts, so a trader in the earlier example 
would have to have $300 in a futures account.
Foreign currency futures
Future currency contracts are contracts that involve the future delivery of 
certain foreign currencies. We discuss these types of futures in Chapter 19.
 
Yes, futures contracts are riskier than options, because you actually have to 
come up with the underlying commodity, bond, stock, or currency to satisfy 
the contract, sell the future at a loss before the settlement date, or pay the 
difference in cash to settle the contract. Futures are binding contracts that 
require you to fulfill the obligations specified in the contracts. Options are less 
risky because they’re not an obligation to perform. Rather, they instead give 
the buyer of the option the right to exercise the option, but the buyer is not 
obligated to do so.
Options
Although futures have been available since the 1850s, it wasn’t until 1975 
when the old Montreal Stock Exchange became the first in North America to 
offer stock options for traders. In the United States options did not become 
available until 1982, when they were part of a government pilot program. 
The big advantage that options have over futures is that you buy the right to 
exercise the option, and yet you still can decide to allow the option to expire 
without ever exercising that right. When you let an option expire, you lose 
only the amount you paid for the option and not the full amount that 
otherwise can be lost in trading the underlying asset. Option sellers take 
the riskier stance, because they can lose the value of whatever asset they 
promised to sell or buy if the option buyer decides to exercise the option.
Options are financial contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the 
obligation, to buy or sell a particular asset at a predetermined date in the 
future at a specified price.
Options lingo
Trading in options has a language all its own, and you’ll need to understand it 
before we get into the mechanics. Some key terms include:
 
✓ Puts: A put option gives the buyer the right to sell a particular asset at a 
specified price at any time during the life of the option.
 
✓ Calls: A call option gives the buyer the right to buy a particular asset at a 
specified price at any time during the life of the option.

297
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
 
✓ Option seller: The person who writes or sells any option is called the 
option seller or writer. This seller (sometimes called an option grantor 
in the United States) must come up with the underlying asset promised 
in the option, even if doing so means a loss, whenever an option buyer 
decides to exercise an option. For example, if an option seller agrees to 
sell you 100 shares of ABC stock for $50 per share on or before May 1, 
and the stock price rises to $60 on April 20, then the seller must sell you 
that stock for $50 and take the $10-per-share loss. You get to sell ABC at 
the current price and reap the profit.
 
✓ Covered calls: If an option seller holds an equivalent position, or owns 
the same number of shares of the underlying asset that is offered in the 
call, this contract is considered a covered call. Options traders selling 
covered calls are trying to take advantage of a neutral or declining stock. 
If the option expires unexercised, the seller (writer) of the option keeps 
the premium. If, on the other hand, the buyer (holder) of the option 
exercises it, the stock must be delivered. However, because the option 
seller already owns the stock, the risk is limited. The opposite scenario 
is an uncovered call, which occurs when the seller sells a call for a stock 
that he or she doesn’t own. The seller of an uncovered call is taking 
virtually unlimited risk.
 
✓ Covered puts: When the seller of a put option also has sold short an 
equivalent amount in the underlying security, then this option is 
considered a covered put. If the seller has neither established a short 
position in the underlying security nor deposited a corresponding 
amount of cash equal to the value of the put, then the put is called a 
naked put. The seller of a naked put also is taking virtually unlimited risk.
 
✓ Option buyer: The person who buys the option is called the option 
buyer or holder. If the option buyer buys the right to sell an asset at 
some time in the future, then he or she buys a put option. If the option 
buyer buys the right to purchase an asset at some time in the future, 
then he or she buys a call option. The most an option buyer can lose is 
the amount paid for the option contract.
 
✓ Underlying asset: An option is based on an underlying asset that can be 
bought or sold such as a futures contract or shares.
 
✓ Premium: The price paid for the option is called the premium, which is 
what the option holder pays to the option seller for the right to either 
buy or sell the underlying asset. Premiums for options are set by the 
open market. Option buyers must pay the premium plus a commission 
and fee.
 
✓ Expiration date: The expiration date is the last day that an option buyer 
can exercise the option. Options based on futures contracts usually 
expire one month before the settlement date of the underlying futures 
contract. After an option expires, the option holder no longer has any 
rights and the option has no value. So option buyers lose whatever 
premium they paid plus any commission and fee. In that case, the option 
is said to expire worthless, or out-of-the-money.

298
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
 
✓ Exercise: Option buyers can exercise their rights any time before the 
expiration date — if, that is, the option they purchased is an American-
style option. European-style options, on the other hand, can be exercised 
only on their expiration dates. Exercising a call option means the option 
buyer buys the underlying asset at the price set in the option regardless 
of the current market price for the asset. Exercising a put option means 
the option buyer sells the underlying asset at the price set in the option. 
An option buyer can always decide not to exercise the rights set forth in 
his or her option and simply let it expire. The option holder also can sell 
the option contract at its current market value.
 
✓ Strike price: The strike price is the price of the underlying asset at which 
the option can be exercised.
 
✓ Offset: If option buyers or sellers want to realize their profits or limit 
their losses, they can offset their option through a sale or purchase that 
also is called liquidating or closing an option. When an option is liquidated, 
no position is actually taken in the underlying asset. Offsetting is usually 
done on the same exchange where the trader first bought or sold the 
option. If he can sell the option for more than he bought it, then he will 
realize a profit. If she sells the option for less than she paid, then she will 
take a loss.
 
✓ In-the-money: An option is in-the-money when it’s worthwhile to exercise 
the option and buy or sell the underlying asset. A call option is in-the-
money when the market price for the underlying asset is above the 
strike price set in the option. A put option is in-the-money when the 
price for the underlying asset is lower than the strike price set in the 
option.
 
✓ At-the-money: An option is at-the-money when the strike price for the 
option is the same as the market price for the underlying asset.
 
✓ Out-of-the-money: An option is out-of-the-money when it’s not worthwhile 
to exercise the option. A call option is out-of-the-money when the strike 
price is higher than the market price for the underlying asset. A put 
option is out-of-the-money when the strike price is less than the market 
price for the underlying asset.
Option pricing
The three factors affecting the price of an option premium are as follows:
 
✓ Date of expiration: As the option moves closer to its date of expiration, 
the value of the option declines, and that’s why an option is considered 
a wasting asset. The more time you have until an option expires, the 
greater possibility you have for the option to reach the point of being 
in-the-money. Longer options therefore have higher premiums.

299
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
 
✓ Strike price: For out-of-the-money options, when the current market 
price moves more and more out-of-the-money and away from the strike 
price, the premium price gets lower and lower. The premium for an 
in-the-money option, on the other hand, rises in value if the underlying 
asset moves further into the money in relationship to the strike price.
 
✓ Volatility: The more volatility that’s in the market for the underlying 
asset, or stock, the greater the chance that the option will become 
worthwhile to exercise. When the market for an asset is volatile, 
premiums for options on that asset are higher.
Option-pricing techniques are considered to be among the most mathematically 
complex of all applied areas of finance. One common example is the Black-
Scholes option-pricing model (named for its developers Fischer Black and 
Canadian Myron Scholes (Nobel Prize winner Scholes was born in Timmins, 
Ontario and graduated from Hamilton’s McMaster University). The model 
takes into consideration the stock’s price, the option’s strike price and 
expiration date, the risk-free return, and the standard deviation of the stock’s 
return, which are all measures of volatility.
When you get a quote for an option, you can choose from numerous strike 
prices and expiration dates that are available. When you’re thinking about 
buying a call option, and its strike price is low and yet close to becoming 
worthwhile to exercise, the premium price (the price you pay for the option) 
will be much higher than for an option with a higher strike price. If you’re 
thinking about buying a put option, then you’ll pay more of a premium for an 
option with a high strike price than you will for one with a lower strike price.
To get an idea of how the pricing of options is affected by strike price and 
time check out Table 18-1, which is an options quote for an imaginary stock 
we call ABC. Settle is the time of expiration for the option.

You can see from the options quotes for ABC stock that a May call with a 
strike price of $54 commands a premium of $2.60 per share. To buy an option 
for 100 shares, the premium would be $260 plus fees. Buying a call is much 
less of a cash outlay than if you were to buy 100 shares of ABC stock at $54, 
which would cost you $5,400. The premium of $260 is paid to the option 
seller, minus any fees.
Commissions vary greatly, so be certain you understand all the possible fees 
before initiating a trade. Some discount brokers charge commissions per 
trade, but others charge on the basis of a round trip, including both the purchase 
and the sale of the option. Some firms charge per-option transaction fees, 
while others charge on the basis of a percentage of the option premium 
that’s usually subject to a minimum charge. Investment advisers can offer a 
flat management fee that allows option trading at large discounts.
 
Commission charges can have a major impact on whether you’re able to 
earn a profit or have to suffer a loss on an option. A high commission charge 
reduces your potential for making a profit and can even drive what little profit 
you make into a loss. So be careful. Know what charges you have to pay and 
compare them with other discount brokers and investment advisers before 
you trade.
Options and futures are quoted with bid and ask prices just like stocks, 
and the spreads with options can grow pretty wide as a percentage of the 
option’s premium — which in turn can have a significant impact on the 
profitability of your option position. The wider the spread, the harder it is 
for you to make a profit. As an option trader, you typically buy at the ask, 
the higher price, and sell at the bid, the lower price. That means any trade 
must recover the difference between the bid and the ask before you can earn 
a profit. As with stock trading, you can use a limit order to put your order 
between the bid and the ask, but no guarantee exists that your order will be 
filled. See Chapter 14 for more about bid–ask spreads.
Buying Options and Futures Contracts
All types of options and futures in Canada are traded on the Montreal 
Exchange. Some types of options can be traded on the NYSE and the Boston 
Option Exchange. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) handles 
stock and several specialized futures options. You can trade stock options 
and some index options in a traditional investment account. Special risk 
release forms must be signed, but otherwise the account remains the same. 
(For more about establishing an account, see Chapter 3.) Covered options 
and naked short positions require a margin account.

301
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
Opening an account
If you want to buy futures or options on futures, you must do so through an 
individual account that you open with a registered futures trading dealer.
You have the choice of opening either a discretionary account or a 
nondiscretionary account. A discretionary account is an account in which you 
sign a power of attorney over to your commodity trading adviser (CTA) so he 
or she can make trading decisions on your behalf. A nondiscretionary account 
is an account in which you make all the trading decisions. You also may 
want to consider trading through a commodity pool. When trading through a 
commodity pool you purchase a share or interest in a pool of other investors. 
Any profits or losses are shared proportionately by the members of the pool.
When you open an individual account, you need to make a deposit that 
amounts to a margin payment or performance bond for the options or futures 
you trade. This payment is relatively small compared to the size of your 
potential market position, and it gives you the opportunity to greatly leverage 
your money. Small changes in options and futures prices can result in large 
gains or large losses in relatively short periods of time.
Your futures trader calculates the values of the futures and option contracts 
in your account on a daily basis, and you need to maintain a margin level 
that’s approximately 75 percent of the amount required when you originally 
enter your positions. If your holdings fall below that level you’ll be asked to 
come up with the cash to restore your margin account to the initial level, a 
situation that’s known as a margin call. If you can’t meet the margin call in a 
reasonable period of time, which can be as little as an hour, your futures firm 
closes out enough of your positions to reduce your margin deficiency. If your 
positions are liquidated at a loss you can be held liable for that loss, which 
sometimes can be substantially more than your original margin deposit.
Custom-designed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide traders with many of 
the features of a futures contract. Traders also can trade options on ETFs — 
if they have the stomach for it — through the Montreal Exchange.
Calculating the price and making a buy
Before buying an option you first must calculate the break-even price; to do 
that you must know the option’s strike price, the premium cost, and the 
commission or other transaction costs. With those three details in hand you 
can determine a break-even price for a call option using this formula:

302
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Option strike price + Option premium costs + Commission and 
transaction fees = Break-even price
Using the example in Table 18-1, here’s the per-share break-even price for 
buying a May call option with a strike price of $54 and a commission of $25, 
or 25 cents per share:
$54 + $2.60 + $0.25 = $56.85
To make a profit on this call option, the stock price of ABC has to rise above 
$56.85. If the stock price doesn’t rise above $56.85, you won’t make a profit 
on this option purchase (unless you’re somehow able to sell the option for 
more than $2.85 before the expiration date — see the next section). These 
calculations are correct only when you have one fee for a round-trip option 
exchange. If you have to pay fees in both directions, which is common, then 
you need to double the fee in the calculation. Most firms charge fees in both 
directions. The fees are the same in each direction, so the cost for trading 
would be double.
When calculating the break-even price for a put option you subtract the 
premium, commission, and transaction costs. So, the break-even calculation 
for a May put option for ABC stock at a strike price of $54 with a commission 
of $25, or 25 cents per share, would look like this:
$54 – $2.00 – 25 cents = $51.75
In this scenario, ABC stock has to drop below $51.75 for this put option to be 
worthwhile.
If you expect a stock price increase, you want to consider purchasing a call 
option, but if you expect a price decline, you want to consider purchasing 
a put option. In both scenarios, you need to check the fundamental and 
technical information you gathered on the underlying stock or asset, so 
you can be certain that any break-even prices you’ve calculated reasonably 
match what your analysis indicates.
Options for Getting Out of Options
After you buy an option, you have to decide how you want to opt out of that 
position. You can choose one of the following three alternatives:
 
✓ Offset the option;
 
✓ Hold the option; or
 
✓ Exercise the option.

303
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
Offsetting the option
You offset an option by liquidating your option position, usually in the same 
marketplace where you bought the option. If you want to get out of an option 
before its expiration date, you can try to sell it for whatever price you can 
get. Doing so either enables you to take your profits or reduces your potential 
loss by the amount you receive for the option. As long as you bought your 
option in an active market, other investors usually are willing to pay for the 
rights your option conveys. The key, of course, is how much they’re willing 
to pay.
Your net profit or loss for this option is determined by the difference 
between what you originally pay in premiums, commissions, and other 
transaction costs minus the premium you receive when you liquidate the 
option after deducting commissions and other transaction costs.
Holding the option
If your option is not yet in-the-money but you still believe it may get there, 
you can continue to hold the option until the exercise date. If you’re right, 
you can exercise the option before the expiration date or liquidate at a later 
date, which means to buy or sell the option before the expiration date at 
some time in the future. If you’re wrong, you risk the possibility that you 
won’t find a buyer or that you’ll have to let the option expire and take a loss 
that is equal to the amount of the premium, commission, and transaction 
costs you paid. Some traders take an even more risky position by buying 
options that are deeply out-of-the-money for just pennies a share. Even if 
these options never grow any nearer to being in-the-money, as long as 
they move in the right direction the premiums will rise. Although we don’t 
recommend using this strategy, profits can be made as long as you’re able to 
sell the option before its expiration date.
 
Options decline in value as they get closer to their expiration dates, so if you 
think you’ve made a mistake and the market moves against your position, bite 
the bullet as soon as possible and try to liquidate your option to minimize 
your losses.
Exercising the option
You can exercise an option any time prior to its expiration date, as long as 
you’re trading in American-style options. You don’t have to wait until the 
exercise date to exercise an American-style option. (The Montreal Exchange 
has both European-style and American-style contract types depending on 
the instrument. Some option contracts sold in the United States are 

304
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
European-style, which can be exercised only on the expiration date.) 
Exercising an option means:
 
✓ Buying the underlying asset when you own a call
 
✓ Selling the underlying asset when you own a put
In general, call options are exercised only when the trader plans to hold the 
underlying asset, and put options are exercised only when the trader owns 
the underlying asset and wants to sell it. Option traders are more likely to 
realize any gains or losses by closing their option positions rather than 
exercising them.
The Risks of Trading Options 
and Futures
Trading in options and futures is risky business, and regulations governing 
those trades are stringent, even with regard to allowing you to open an 
account. Before opening an account for you, a firm must provide you with 
a disclosure document that describes the risks involved in trading futures 
and options contracts. The document gives you the opportunity to determine 
whether you have the experience and financial resources necessary to 
engage in option trading and whether option trading is appropriate for 
meeting your goals and objectives.
Topics that must be covered in the disclosure statement include the risks 
inherent in trading futures contracts or options and the effect that leveraging 
your account can have on potential losses or gains. The statement also must 
include warnings about trading futures in foreign markets, because those 
types of trades carry additional risks from fluctuations in currency exchange 
rates and differences in regulatory protection.
Commodities options and futures also can be risky, because many of the 
factors that affect their prices are totally unpredictable, such as the weather, 
labour strikes, inflation, foreign exchange rates, and governmental policies. 
Because positions in futures and options are so highly leveraged, even a 
small price movement against your position can result in at least the loss of 
your entire premium payment and possibly even much greater liability for 
additional losses.
 
After you begin trading options and futures, you can’t close your account until 
all open positions are closed — if, that is, you’re trading through an account 
with a commodities exchange. This restriction does not apply to options 
traded in an investment account. Any accruals on futures contracts are paid 
out daily. Any funds in your margin account that are beyond your required 

305
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
margin or account-opening requirements can be withdrawn, but other such 
funds have to remain in the account until all your positions are closed. 
Any restrictions on the withdrawal of your funds are stated in the original 
disclosure document. Be sure you understand those restrictions before 
committing your funds.
After opening your account, your firm usually mails or emails confirmation 
of all purchases and sales, a month-end summary of transactions that shows 
any gains or losses, and an evaluation of your open positions and current 
account values. You need to be able to get information from your firm on a 
daily basis after you begin to trade.
Futures traders must maintain adequate margin in their futures accounts 
by the process known as marking-to-market. At the end of each trading day, 
margin requirements are adjusted by the change in the price of the futures 
contracts.
 
Investment dealers are required to segregate any money you deposit in your 
account from the dealer’s own funds. The amount segregated either increases 
or decreases depending on the success of your trades. Even when the firm 
segregates your funds, you still may not be able to get all your money back if 
the firm becomes insolvent and is unable to cover all the obligations to its 
customers unless the firm is a member of the Canadian Investor Protection 
Fund (CIPF) www.cipf.ca.
 
When problems with your dealer arise that you can’t resolve without help, 
you do have dispute-resolution options. Before deciding how you want to 
proceed you must consider the costs involved, the length of time it may take 
to resolve the problem, and whether you want to contact an attorney. You can 
get more information about dispute resolution by contacting the Investment 
Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) at www.iiroc.ca/
English/Investors/MakingComplaint or by calling 1-877-442-4322. 
Another useful Web site is www.investored.ca, which is funded by the 
Ontario Securities Commission (OSC).
Minimizing Risks
In a nutshell, the best way to minimize the risks of derivatives trading is to 
take the time to find out as much as you can about the inherent risks of the 
derivatives you’re trading and how others have dealt with them. The first 
step you can take is to check out the firms or individuals with whom you 
plan to trade. All firms and individuals that offer to trade options or futures 
must be registered with one of the members of the Canadian Securities 
Administrators (www.securities-administrators.ca). You can check 
out firms and individuals online at the IIROC Web site (www.iiroc.ca).

306
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Next, be sure you’re familiar with the firm’s commission charges and how 
they’re calculated. Compare the firm’s quotes with those of other firms 
you’re considering. Whenever a firm has unusually high commission charges, 
ask for a detailed explanation for the higher charges and what additional 
services justify the higher cost.
 
Always make sure you calculate the break-even price for any option you’re 
thinking about purchasing, because you have to know at what point the option 
you’re planning to buy will be profitable and whether the data you’ve collected 
justifies the option’s premium costs.
You also need to understand the market for the underlying asset of the 
option or future you plan to buy and what can impact the market price of 
that asset. Be sure your expectations for the potential profits from the option 
or futures contract you choose are reasonable.
 
You don’t ever want to buy an option without first coming to a full realization 
that you can lose the entire value of your trade. If you want to take the riskier 
position as an option seller, be sure you can accept the possibility that your 
losses may exceed the premium you initially received for the option. Option 
selling comes with the potential of unlimited losses, as does futures trading.
Just as with stock trading, you can limit your losses by carefully setting your 
risk limits before you start to trade. Don’t let yourself get caught up in the 
emotions of futures and options trading. Develop a plan before you buy that 
first option or future and stick with that plan, and be sure to diversify your 
holdings not only by asset type but also by time of expiration.
 
After you determine how much capital you want to put into trading derivatives, 
make sure you know how much you can afford to lose on just one trade to be 
able to stay in business. You don’t want to overexpose your cash position on 
one trade and risk the possibility that you won’t have the money you need 
when the next opportunity comes along. By exposing your capital to a variety 
of markets, you also have a better chance that some of your trades will end up 
succeeding — how bad can that be?
 
Be wary of firms that lead you to believe you can make lots of money trading 
options or futures with very little risk. That’s never true. If a firm is using 
high-pressure tactics to get you to trade that’s a sure sign of a problem, so 
don’t allow yourself to be rushed into a trading decision. If you aren’t being 
given enough time to construct your own fundamental and technical analyses 
before you make a purchase, walk away from the deal.
The risks associated with trading futures and options can be more than 
you initially paid for the trade, so be careful out there! We’ve given you an 
overview of the options and futures trading arena, but before you jump in be 
sure you get significantly more training.

T
rading money in the global markets can be a great way to make more of 
it, but beware that it also can be a lesson in how to lose money quickly. 
According to the Bank for International Settlements more than $4 trillion 
is traded every day on the foreign currency exchange (forex), and yet no 
centralized headquarters or formal regulatory body exists for this form of 
trade. It is by far the largest and most liquid market in the world. London is 
the main trading centre, but New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Dubai, 
Zurich, and Singapore are important trading centres as well.
Foreign currency exchange is regulated through a patchwork of international 
agreements among countries, most of which have some type of regulatory 
agency that controls what goes on within their respective borders. Thus, the 
foreign currency exchange actually is a worldwide network of traders who 
are connected by telephones and computer screens.
Although more international policing of money trading has occurred in 
recent years, authorities have had some successes exposing scams and 
frauds that victimize traders, especially newer ones. So if you want to try 
this wild world of trading, you need to be wary and not depend entirely on 
what we discuss here in this chapter. Sure, we explain the workings of foreign 
exchange markets and how the language of the forex and its risks are unique, 
but you need to obtain a whole bunch more training before you ever consider 
entering this extremely risky trading arena.

Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Exploring the World of Foreign 
Currency Exchange
If you’ve ever travelled outside of Canada, you’ve probably traded in a 
foreign currency. Every time you travel you have to exchange your country’s 
currency for the currency used in the country you’re visiting. If you’re a 
Canadian citizen shopping in England, and you see a sweater that you want 
for £100 (100 pounds — the pound is the currency in the United Kingdom), 
you’d need to know the exchange rate. In November 2009, for example, the 
rate was $1.7521 for one British pound. So a £100 sweater would cost you 
$175.21 in Canadian dollars.
We include this example here to show you how foreign currency exchange 
is used by the average shopper, but foreign currency traders trade much 
larger sums of money thousands of times a day. The majority of trades take 
place in three main centres of currency trading — the United Kingdom, the 
United States, and Hong Kong. The rest of the trading takes place primarily 
in Singapore, Switzerland, Japan, Germany, China, Canada, and Australia. 
According to Euromoney’s FX Poll 2009, the United Kingdom manages the 
largest share — about 23 percent. The United States is second with 21 percent, 
and Switzerland is third with 18 percent.
 
Currency trading is ongoing, 24 hours a day, with some countries just getting 
started as others are finishing up their business day. For example, when the 
trading day opens at 8 a.m. in London, the trading day is ending for Singapore 
and Hong Kong. When Toronto, Montreal, and New York open their trading 
doors, it’s already 1 p.m. in London. Thus, traders must be alert around the 
clock, because a major event at an off hour anywhere in the world can shake 
the currency markets at any time. Pity poor Vancouver, San Francisco, and 
Los Angeles, the weakest links in the so-called 24-hour foreign exchange 
market that spans the globe.
Individual trades in the range of $200 million to $500 million are not 
uncommon. In fact, estimates indicate that quoted price changes occur as 
frequently as 20 times per minute, and the most active currency rates can 
change as many as 18,000 times in a single day, according to the U.S. Federal 
Reserve.
Types of currency traders
Traders can be grouped into one of four basic types — bankers, investment 
dealers, customers, and central banks. Each plays a different role in the 
foreign currency exchange market.

309
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
 
✓ Bankers, banks, and other financial institutions do the lion’s share of 
trading. They make profits buying and selling currency with each other. 
Approximately two-thirds of all forex transactions involve banks dealing 
directly with each other.
 
✓ Investment dealers sometimes act as intermediaries between the banks, 
helping them — or other traders looking for a good deal — find out 
where they can get the best currency trade. Buyers and sellers like 
working through investment dealers, because they can trade anonymously 
through intermediaries. Dealers make profits on currency exchanges by 
charging a spread for the transactions they arrange.
 
✓ Customers, which primarily are major companies, trade currency so 
they can operate globally or invest internationally. For example, if a 
Canadian car manufacturer buys parts from a manufacturer in Japan, 
then the Canadian car manufacturer needs to buy and pay for the parts 
in Japanese yen. Companies that trade currencies regularly have their 
own trading desks, while others conduct their currency trading through 
dealers or banks.
 
✓ Central banks, like the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the U.S. Federal 
Reserve, which act on behalf of their governments, sometimes participate 
in the forex market to influence the value of the currencies of their 
respective countries. For example, if the Bank of Canada believes the 
dollar is weak, it may buy dollars and even encourage central banks 
of other countries to do the same in the forex market, to boost, or 
increase, the value of the dollar. This policy has not been used by the 
BoC for a long time.
Why currency changes in value
Among the many factors that impact the value of a nation’s currency are
 
✓ Interest rates
 
✓ Business cycles
 
✓ Political developments
 
✓ Changes in tax laws
 
✓ Stock market news
 
✓ Inflationary expectations
 
✓ International investment patterns
 
✓ Policies adopted by governments and central banks
 
✓ Employment levels

310
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Traders must monitor all these potential factors so they can stay on top of 
political or economic changes that impact the value of the currencies they 
hold. Currency trading, like other forms of trading, is affected by the basic 
economic principle of supply and demand. When a whole bunch of one type 
of currency is available for sale, the market can be flooded with it, and the 
price of that currency drops. When the supply of currency is low and the 
demand for it is high, then the value of that currency rises. Governments 
may try to influence the value of their respective currencies by flooding the 
market whenever they want the value to fall or making the supply scarce (by 
buying their own currency) whenever they hope the value of their currencies 
might rise.
What traders do
Currency traders look for a currency that offers the highest return with the 
lowest risk. For example, if a nation’s financial instruments, such as stocks 
and bonds, offer high rates of return with relatively low risk, then traders 
who are foreign to that nation want to buy that currency, thus increasing 
the demand. Currency is also in demand when its country is going through a 
growth segment in its business cycle highlighted by stable prices and a wide 
range of goods and services available for sale. Forex traders who speculate 
on currencies to earn their keep look for specific signs to indicate when 
exchange rates may change, including the following:
 
✓ Political instability: Unrest in a country drives up demand for currency 
in safer markets, such as Canadian dollars, as speculators race to find 
safe havens. The U.S. dollar used to be the world’s safe haven of choice; 
not so since its recent credit crunch troubles. In fact, during 2009 fifteen 
of the world’s currencies rose in value against the once-mighty U.S. 
dollar. Only the Japanese yen slipped against the American dollar.
 
✓ Rising interest rates: Higher interest rates encourage offshore investments 
in countries where local investors are seeking better rates of return than 
they can get at home.
 
✓ Economic reforms: Economic reforms in developing countries may help 
improve their currencies. As a result, investors see new opportunities 
for investing in the currencies of those successfully developing countries.
Traders try to predict these moves in advance, so they can get in or out of 
a currency before others. Correctly guessing where a currency is going and 
taking a position in that currency at the beginning of the trend can mean 
huge profits for a trader. Traders make money either by buying the currency 
at a lower price and then selling it later at a higher price, or by selling their 
currencies of other countries at higher prices before they have time to react 
negatively. After the markets for their original holdings fall, they simply 
reestablish positions at bargain prices.

311
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
 
When a trader purchases a large amount of a particular currency, then he or 
she is long the currency. Conversely, when a trader sells a large amount of a 
currency, then he or she is short the currency.
The forex market is dominated by four currencies, which account for 80 
percent of the market — the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and 
the British pound. These currencies always are liquid, which makes finding 
someone willing to buy or sell any of them easy for traders. Other currencies 
are not as liquid, and as is true with the stocks of small companies, you’re 
sometimes unable to find any buyers or sellers when you’re ready to trade 
for the currency of a smaller country. Currencies of developing countries 
are softest, usually facing lower demand than the currencies of developed 
countries. Soft currencies at times can be difficult to convert.
Understanding Money Jargon
The world of foreign currency exchange has a unique language of its own. 
Prices are quoted two ways, meaning that when one trader talks price with 
another, they state their respective prices in terms of what exchange rate 
they’ll pay to buy it and what they’ll take when selling it. Bid and ask price 
differences, or spreads, usually are stated in pips or hundredths of a currency 
unit. Spreads normally are no more than ten pips.
Pips are the smallest incremental price movement permitted in the currency 
market. Although most transactions deal in thousands or millions of dollars, 
yen, euro, or other currencies — and a one-cent spread can equal thousands 
of dollars — most currency price quotes nevertheless are extended out 
four decimals (1.5432, for example). Many times traders quote only the last 
two digits, or the small numbers, such as 32 exchange for 22, because the 
incremental changes are so small only the last two digits matter.
As a trader, you need to think in terms of the host currency when receiving 
a quote for direct exchange, which would be an exchange based on the value 
of the host country’s currency. Quotes for indirect exchange are just the 
opposite. They’re based on the foreign currency for which you are seeking 
a trade rather than on the host currency. For example, if you’re in Canada 
and receive an indirect price quote, you’d be getting a price based on buying 
a set amount of foreign currency in exchange for Canadian dollars. Most 
exchanges take place on the interbank market — currency exchanges among 
the world’s banks — and are based on the U.S. dollar. The one exception to 
the rule is the British pound sterling.
Traders use three different types of trades to exchange currency. They’re 
known as spot, forward, and options transactions.

312
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Spot transactions
Spot transactions account for about a third of all forex transactions and 
involve trades in which two traders agree on an exchange rate and then trade 
currencies based on that rate. These transactions usually start with one 
trader calling another and asking for a price on a particular type of currency 
without specifying whether he or she wants to buy or sell. The trader on the 
receiving end of the call gives the caller a two-way price — one if he or she 
wants to buy and another if he or she wants to sell. If they agree to do business, 
the two exchange their respective currencies.
Forward transactions
Forward transactions are used when traders want to buy or sell currency at 
some agreed-upon forward date. A buyer and a seller set an exchange rate 
for the transaction, and the transaction occurs at the set price at the 
appointed time regardless of what the current market price is for the 
currencies. Forward transactions can be only a few days or even years in 
the future, although most futures contracts are for 30, 60, or 90 days. The 
two types of forward transactions are futures and swaps.
 
✓ Futures: Futures are forward transactions that have standard contract 
sizes and maturity dates. These types of transactions are traded on an 
exchange set up for this purpose.
 
✓ Swaps: A swap, the more common type of forward transaction, is a 
private contract through which two parties exchange currencies for a 
specific length of time and then agree to reverse the transaction at a 
later date, which is set at the time of the initial contract.
The risk that traders take in using forward transactions is that market rates 
can change, turning the contract to which they’ve just agreed into a losing 
trade. They still have to fulfill the contract at the fixed price, because after 
the contract is signed the price cannot be revised.
Companies that place orders for imported products from foreign firms usually 
use this type of transaction so they can lock in an exchange rate at some time 
in the future when their orders are ready. Companies placing these orders 
don’t want to lay out the cash upfront to exchange currencies, but they 
nevertheless want to be able to budget set amounts for their purchases. As 
such, they’d rather risk missing a better rate for the currency exchange in the 
future than a major shift in the price of the product (perhaps brought on by 
a currency shock) that’s going to end up costing them much more than they 
intended to pay.

313
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
Options
Option contracts were added to the forex world to give traders a bit more 
flexibility than a forward transaction affords them. Like forward transactions, 
the owner of an option contract has the right to either buy or sell a specified 
amount of foreign currency at a specified rate up to a specified date. The big 
difference with option contracts is that traders who hold a contract are not 
obligated to fulfill the transaction. They can, instead, simply decide to let it 
expire.
Option buyers have to pay for the right to buy or sell these transactions 
on or before a specified date. The set price at which the currencies are 
exchanged is called the strike price. When the date for the exchange arrives, 
the option holder determines whether the strike price is favourable. If it 
is, the option owner completes the transaction and earns a profit. If it isn’t 
favourable, the option owner allows the option to expire and absorbs the 
cost of purchasing the original option, which is less of a loss than actually 
exchanging the currencies. The two types of options currency traders deal 
with are
 
✓ Call options, to buy currency at some set price in the future, and
 
✓ Put options, to sell currency at some set price in the future.
For example, suppose a trader purchases a six-month call option on one 
million euros at an exchange rate of 1.39 dollars to the euro. During that 
six-month period, the trader can (has the option to) either purchase the 
euros at the $1.39 rate, buy them at market rate, or do nothing at all. As 
market rates for currencies fluctuate, options in those currencies can be 
sold and resold many times before the expiration date. Companies operating 
overseas use options as insurance against major unfavourable market shifts 
in the exchange rate and thus avoid locking their companies into guaranteed 
exchanges.

when seeking price quotes. We list some of the more common currency

You can find current exchange rates for most major currencies online at the 
Universal Currency Converter (www.xe.com/ucc). You merely set an amount, 
choose the type of currency you want to convert, and select the type of 
currency you want to convert into. The site tells you the exchange rate and 
how much your currency is worth when converted. The site won’t give you a 
rate where you’re guaranteed to find a trade, but it certainly gives you a decent 
estimate — to within six decimal points. Billed as “The world’s favourite cur-
rency and foreign exchange site,” the Universal Currency Converter was founded 
in 1993 in Ontario by Steven Dengler. Although Canada is not a currency trading 
centre by any means, the site became one of the Internet’s first dynamic sites. In 
many countries xe.com is one of the 100 most popular sites on the Web!
How Money Markets Work
The currency exchange market is made up of about 2,000 dealer institutions 
that are particularly active in foreign currency exchanges. Most of the 
players are commercial or investment banks that are geographically dis-
persed in the key financial centres around the world. Among these 2,000 
dealers, around 100 to 200 members carry on the core trading and market-
making activities. Major players are fewer still.

315
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
As of May 2009, two British banks, a German bank, and a Swiss bank 
commanded 55 percent of the overall volume of currencies traded. When a 
dealer buys a Canadian dollar, regardless of where in the world the transaction 
takes place, the actual deposit is located either directly in a Canadian bank or 
in a claim of a foreign bank on a dollar deposit located in Canada. The same 
is true of the currency of any other country.
Different countries, different rules
The actual infrastructures of the various currency markets and how they 
operate are determined by each separate nation. Each country enforces its 
own laws, banking regulations, accounting rules, and tax codes. The method 
of payment and the settlement system also are determined separately by 
each country. But yikes, doesn’t that mean you have to know a lot about 
international monetary laws to be able to trade? Yup. Especially if you want 
to be successful.
Luckily, considerable global cooperation exists among exchange regulators, 
which minimizes differences and helps protect forex traders from fraud 
and abuse. Governments around the world reach agreements, or memoranda 
of understanding (MOUs), with most other major nations that have active 
currency exchanges, and these MOUs form a method of cooperation between 
regulatory and enforcement authorities across international borders that 
combats fraud and other illegal practices that can harm customers or 
threaten market integrity.
 
If you plan to become involved in foreign currency exchange, be sure to bone 
up on your knowledge of the company you’re dealing with and find information 
about recently exposed scams and other illegal activities. You certainly don’t 
want to get caught up in a fraudulent deal and lose all your money. Some very 
nasty scams have involved so-called “offshore currency trading.”
The almighty (U.S.) dollar
Despite its large decline during 2008–2009, the U.S. dollar still is the most 
widely traded currency. The euro and the U.S. dollar are the two currencies 
that are involved in more than 85 percent of all global foreign exchange 
transactions. The U.S. dollar wears many hats, serving as an investment 
currency in many capital markets, a reserve currency for many central banks, 
a transaction currency for many commodity trades, an invoice currency for 
many contracts, and a currency of intervention used by countries that want 
to influence the values of their own currencies.
Due to the recent and steep decline of the U.S. dollar, China and some of the 
oil-exporting countries (such as Venezuela and Iran) have voiced concerns 

316
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
about its default status as the currency of choice. So far it’s lots of talk, and 
we don’t know of any major purchases for which U.S. dollars have been 
refused. Vendors of commodities priced in U.S. dollars have been asking for 
more and more U.S. dollars to complete their transactions as the U.S. dollar 
continues to decline. The last Middle East oil producer to export its oil in 
euros rather than dollars was Iraq’s Saddam Hussein. A few months later the 
Americans and British troops invaded.
The currency in China is the yuan, which is fixed or “pegged” to the U.S. 
dollar. President Obama wants China to dismantle the currency peg and let 
the value rise against the U.S. dollar. A rising yuan would assist Canada’s 
export industries looking for Asian markets to replace our dependence on 
American consumers.
Due to this friction over the value of the U.S. dollar, some executives at the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) say the days of the almighty U.S. dollar as 
the global benchmark are numbered.
Organized exchanges
The money market is largely unregulated as a defined market. By that, we 
mean that a commercial bank in Canada or the United States doesn’t need 
any special authorization to trade or deal in foreign currencies. Securities 
and investment firms don’t need special permission from the OSC or any 
other regulatory body to carry out foreign exchange activities.
 
Transactions can be carried out based on whatever terms the law permits and 
using whatever provisions are acceptable to the two parties, subject to the 
commercial law governing business transactions. Of course that means the 
money market can be the closest thing to the Wild West you’ll find in some 
parts of the trading world. Almost anything goes. Institutions that participate 
are not inspected specifically for their exchange practices, but regulatory 
authorities nevertheless look into trading systems as part of their regular 
examinations of financial institutions, just to be sure they’re operating under 
the country’s commercial banking or securities laws. They’re also inspected 
in order to prevent laundering of drug money, proceeds of crime, or terrorist 
financing.
 
Although no official rules or restrictions govern the hours or conditions of 
trading on this over-the-counter (OTC) market in the United States, trading 
conventions developed mostly by market participants are in place in Canada.
The currency exchange market is mostly accounted for by the Big Five 
chartered banks in Canada, including spot transactions, forwards, and swaps. 
If you’re new to forex trading, starting out is much safer with a large bank, 
where you can trade currency futures and certain currency options.

The Risks of the World Money Market
Leverage, or margin, which means borrowing money to trade, is the number 
one risk to your portfolio when trading in money markets. Success on the 
foreign currency market means having to trade in large sums, because profits 
are made at differences of only fractions of a cent or pips. Banks or dealers 
determine the leverage they want to offer you, but you might not find strict 
regulations like the ones that govern stock margin accounts.
After you’re approved for trading, you’re given a set amount or allowance on 
which you can trade on margin. A common starting allowance for trading on 
margin is 5 percent (see Chapter 14 for more about margins), which means 
that if you put $100,000 in the bank, you’re allowed to execute transactions of 
up to $2 million. As you gain success with more experience, that margin may 
be lowered to 1 percent, which means you’d be allowed to trade as much as 
$10 million on your $100,000 deposit — but you’ll be liable for all your losses 
and your costs of borrowing.
 
When trading at those high margin levels, even a minor mistake can wipe out 
your entire deposit.
The most conservative of banks require full margin, meaning you have to 
deposit $1 million to be able to trade $1 million. Be sure you understand the 
leverage you’re being offered and the loss potential you face if your trade 
goes sour. Just imagine starting with $100,000, which you can use to trade 
$2 million, and then losing half of that trading maximum with trades that 
have gone sour. You could end up $900,000 in the hole. Sure, lots of traders 
can come up with that, no problem. In reality, as long as you stick to trading 
the major currencies drastic price changes that end up in that type of loss 
are possible but unlikely — but a loss of 10 to 20 percent of your holding 
in a matter of minutes can happen. Only trading in third-world currencies 
could result in losses of the million-dollar magnitude described here, and 
only if there was a major uprising in the country and the price of its currency 
dropped dramatically — like what sadly has happened in Zimbabwe!
Types of risk
You also face a number of different kinds of risk, including market risk, 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, counterparty risk, volatility risk, liquidity 
risk, and country risk.

318
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Market risk
All traders and investors face market risk. Basically, market risk comprises 
changes in price that adversely impact your trade or investment. Market 
risk is in play from the moment you enter into a foreign currency position 
until the moment you exit it. The foreign exchange rate can change any time 
during that period, so when you’re dealing in foreign currency, two key 
factors can impact the price of the currency — exchange risk and interest 
rate risk.
Exchange risk
Foreign exchange traders take on exchange risk the moment they buy or 
sell a foreign currency. Every time you take on a new foreign exchange 
position, regardless of whether it’s through a spot, forward, future, or option 
transaction, you’re immediately exposed to the potential that the exchange 
rate will move against your position, making it worth less than when you 
bought it. In only a matter of seconds, a profitable transaction can turn into 
an unprofitable one.
Interest rate risk
Foreign exchange positions can change in value not only because of the 
exchange rate but also because of the currency’s underlying interest rate. 
Whenever a country’s central bank (think Bank of Canada) raises or lowers 
the underlying interest rate for its currency, the impact on any positions 
you’re holding in that country’s currency can be major.
Counterparty risk
In the currency trading world, a counterparty is the other entity involved in a 
transaction — a bank or banker, a dealer, or another trader. When you buy 
a currency option or execute a forward transaction, you risk the possibility 
that the counterparty to your transaction won’t be able to meet his, her, or 
its obligations.
Note: When you buy the option through an exchange rather than directly 
from the counterparty, this risk is not a factor. When that happens you 
run into additional replacement costs, because you’re forced to enter into 
another currency transaction to meet your own foreign currency needs. 
The key to avoiding this kind of risk is entering into contracts with known 
institutions that have high credit ratings. Additionally, you need to investigate 
whether the counterparty with which you’re trading has had any problems 
with regulators, insolvency, or questions of ethical conduct.
When evaluating a company, first consider its credit risk. You can find credit 
rankings for many major banks at the Standard & Poor’s Web site (www2.
standardandpoors.com). You can research a company’s creditworthiness 

319
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
by investigating the requirements and standards it uses when providing 
credit to its customers. Companies that provide easy credit to their customers 
run a greater risk of not being able to meet their obligations. Conversely, 
companies with higher margin limits definitely are safer to do business with 
when you’re entering into a contract.
Volatility risk
Volatility risk relates to the possibility of rapidly changing exchange rates 
that can impact your positions in foreign currencies. As we mention in the 
“Exploring the World of Foreign Currency Exchange” section in this chapter, 
currency prices can change thousands of times per day. Options on currencies 
are valued according to volatility and underlying changes in the prices of the 
respective currencies. If a trader sees an increase of 100 percent in volatility, 
or a doubling of volatility, then the price of the option can increase 5 percent 
to 10 percent. If you’re trading on credit, which is highly likely, your bank 
or dealer can reevaluate the credit it’s extending to you whenever it sees a 
dramatic increase in the volatility of your holdings.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is not a major factor if you’re trading in the more commonly 
traded currencies, but if you decide to trade in less active currencies it 
can become a factor when you’re unable to sell a currency you hold at the 
express time you want the sale to take place, especially when the market for 
that currency is not active — such as the hours when Toronto is closed and 
Hong Kong is not yet open. You can avoid liquidity risk by buying currency 
options or futures on an exchange.
Country risk
Country risks come in several different varieties, all of which you need to 
consider whenever you trade in foreign currencies. Among those aspects are
 
✓ Political risk: This variety relates to the political stability of the country 
in whose currency you’re trading. We have seen recent seizures of 
commercial assets by some nations. For example, Venezuela took control 
of its oil industry by seizing assets of non-Venezuelan oil companies. 
American and European governments have seized control of automotive 
and financial companies. If you trade in currencies of countries that are 
at risk of possible destabilization, the currency you buy can become 
worthless if the country changes political leaders.
 
✓ Regulation risk: This variety relates to what can happen after you 
establish a position in a country’s currency. Its government can 
change its regulations, and in effect put restraints on the ownership 
established by your position in the currency and by the position of your 
counterparty — and that can get messy.

320
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
 
✓ Legal risk: This variety relates to which country has jurisdiction to rule 
on a contract if your counterparty happens to default. Unfavourable 
contract law in the host country of your counterparty can end up 
determining that the contract is invalid or illegal, and you can lose your 
position. Be sure you understand from whom you’re buying and under 
which country’s laws any disputes will be settled. Be certain you 
understand contract law in the country of the counterparty with whom 
you’re trading.
 
✓ Holiday risk: This variety relates to the possibility that the country 
in whose currency you’re trading has different religious, political, or 
government holidays that can shut down trading in that currency right 
when you need the money. Be sure you know the holiday schedules for 
the countries in whose currencies you trade.
Seeking risk protection
Although trading in foreign currencies often is called the modern-day Wild 
West, forces are in place that can help you minimize the risks — provided 
you take advantage of them and trade within their boundaries. The primary 
monitors of foreign currency trading are the world’s central banks. They 
monitor the flow of money between countries and the balance of payments 
between governments and banking institutions. Regulatory authorities exist 
in most major currency markets, but if you decide to do business with a 
nonbanking institution you’re transacting your business in unprotected 
waters outside the safe harbour of regulatory oversight and must do so 
under the often fateful guise of caveat emptor — let the buyer beware.
Internationally, the Bank for International Settlement (BIS; www.bis.org) 
is the leading independent agency for evaluating foreign exchange trading 
institutions on a global basis. BIS created risk-weighted evaluation and 
capital requirements for institutions that trade in foreign currencies and 
money market transactions. Be certain that any institution with which you 
plan to conduct trades meets BIS standards.
A number of common clearing systems assist with the transfer of foreign 
currencies. The two best-known ones are the Clearing House Interbank 
Payments System, or CHIPS, and the Society for Worldwide Interbank 
Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT. Be sure you’re using one of these 
systems when you trade, because they code transactions to avoid defaults 
and help you identify the creditworthiness of transactions.
If you’re trading in foreign currency futures your risks are much less, because 
the futures industry is highly regulated. Clearinghouses for futures are efficient, 
and futures transactions usually are cleared hourly or in some cases even 
minute-by-minute.

321
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
Getting Ready to Trade Money
Your first step as a foreign currency trader is to develop an extensive 
collection of historical information not only about rate fluctuations for the 
currencies you plan to trade but also about interest rate fluctuations, economic 
history, and political stability of the countries whose currencies you’re 
considering. Gathering some background information about the forex market 
itself doesn’t hurt either. You can find more details about trading currency in 
Currency Trading For Dummies by Mark Galant and Brian Dolan (Wiley).
After collecting this information, you need to consider your own trading 
goals and how much you want to put at risk. Set your risk limits before 
you start, so you don’t get emotionally caught up in having to make these 
potentially disastrous trading decisions on the fly. Capital that you risk on 
foreign currency trading needs to be money that you can afford to lose 
without impacting your lifestyle. Do not, for any reason, use retirement 
savings, savings for your children’s educations, or savings required to 
maintain your house and lifestyle.
 
As is true for stock trading, when trading currencies you need to develop a 
plan that determines what you trade and how much you’re at risk. When 
your plan’s in place, stick to it for the entire trading day. You should not be 
developing the plan and executing it at the same time. Foreign currency 
trading requires a great deal of focus, and you can’t risk breaking that focus to 
do additional planning in the middle of a trading day. Monitor the successes 
you have in meeting the goals of your plan. If you’re not achieving your 
objectives, you may want to step back and reevaluate your plan and your 
decision to trade in foreign currency.
Technical analysis is used by foreign currency traders in a way that is similar 
to stock trading (see Chapters 9 and 10). Bar charts are the most common 
tools. The basic bar chart shows the opening, high, low, and closing prices 
for a given period of time.
 
The key difference between trading currencies and stocks is that in the foreign 
exchange market, a daily price chart sometimes shows the opening price in 
the Pacific Rim and the closing price in Canada. Because the foreign exchange 
market is open almost 24 hours a day, time periods are different for foreign 
currency trading than for stock trading. You can play with forex charting 
online at www.forex-markets.com/charts.htm.
We won’t cover the basics of technical analysis for foreign currency trading, 
because we’d need to take up another entire book to do it right. That’s 
exactly why Wiley Publishing Inc. also publishes Technical Analysis For 
Dummies by Barbara Rockefeller (Wiley). Be sure to check it out, too.

322
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
 
Because we can’t say it enough, we repeat: If you truly want to pursue this 
form of trading, we highly recommend you seek additional training before you 
begin trading individually.

Trading for Others: Obtaining 
Trading Designations and 
Certifications
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring CSI tests
▶ Deciphering financial adviser designations
▶ Knowing what designations are required
▶ Getting your own designation
A
s you become more involved in trading, you hear more about getting 
a designation to trade for others. These designations refer to exami-
nations administered by the Canadian Securities Institute (CSI), which you 
must pass to be able to work in various capacities within the securities field. 
After passing these examinations, you can become licensed in the securities 
markets. What tests you need to take depend on where you plan to work and 
what you plan to do.
You also may hear an alphabet soup of designations like CFA, CFP, CLU, CMT, 
PFP, RFP. All are certifications given by different professional organizations 
to people who have completed coursework, testing, and, in most cases, years 
of work experience.
Naturally, investment and trading advisers must be licensed. In this chapter, 
we discuss the various types of licences and certifications and the level of 
training that is required for each. We also describe the types of tests CSI 
offers for each of its designations and help you find out about how advisers 
are licensed and regulated and what requirements you need to fulfill if you 
plan to make trades for others.

Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Considering Trading Professionally
The simple fact that you’ve bought or borrowed this book shows you have 
an interest in trading securities. At the point when you become a good trader 
and have confidence in your ability to trade profitably, your success at trading 
will be limited by the amount of your own capital. If you wish to dedicate 
yourself toward the profession of trading for others, then your upside is 
almost without limit. Your rewards can be in the amount of capital you 
accumulate for yourself and your family, or in the satisfaction of helping 
others with your trading advice — or both.
For most Canadians, paying their share of taxes is by far the biggest expense 
they incur every year. Tax advice is as important as medical advice for much 
of Canada’s population. Luckily for us, the government provides many good 
tax-assisted deals to encourage us to invest in a home, a renovation, an 
education, a retirement, a major medical expense, or a charitable donation. 
Remember the RRSPs, RRIFs, RESPs, TFSAs, and IPPs we describe in Chapters 
3 and 17? Most Canadian families have several of these pools of tax-deferred 
money that need to be looked after. Much of this money should be safely 
invested in government bonds, which are safe and liquid. However, billions 
of dollars of this money needs to be traded. That’s right — other people’s 
money needs to be traded! If you can provide good tax efficiency along with 
decent trading advice, your services will be in demand. You could translate 
your interest in trading into becoming eligible to trade for others.
Doctors, dentists, vets, engineers, and lawyers all need to spend at least 
ten years in expensive university courses and apprenticeships before they 
are able to command seven-figure annual salaries. Trading for others as an 
investment adviser requires $1,500 to pay for about eight months of study 
and only three exams (which we cover in the next section, “Getting to Know 
the CSI Series”). That’s it. Naturally you need to impress somebody enough 
to want to offer you a job, but it’s not rocket science (or medical school). The 
wonderful thing about these required courses in Canada is that anybody can 
enroll at any time. You don’t need to be sponsored by a financial company, 
as you do in the United States. No university entrance requirements, no 
admissions tests, no letters of reference, and your study materials are available 
online within an hour of payment being received. After only a couple of years, 
a good trader licensed to trade for others can be enjoying a seven-figure 
annual income. All doctors, dentists, vets, engineers, and lawyers need trading 
advice; not all traders need doctors, dentists, vets, engineers, and lawyers.
As of January 2010, more than 200 firms are licensed to trade securities in 
Canada. If you can prove you’re a good trader, and you want to trade other 
people’s money, you’ll be offered a position as an investment adviser or a 
discount broker. The former is much more rewarding for you than the latter. 

325
 Chapter 20: Trading for Others: Obtaining Trading Designations and Certifications
Perhaps you need to take it one step at a time by temporarily becoming a 
discount broker to get your foot in the door of the investment industry. 
That’s not such a bad detour on your way to becoming an investment adviser 
trading other people’s money.
With so many investment firms in Canada, you might not have to put on a 
suit and tie every day and commute to an office tower in the nearest large 
city. Many different platforms are set up for you to trade for others. Most 
Canadian investment advisers work for the Big Five bank-owned investment 
dealers. These employers prefer their recruits to have undergraduate 
degrees and/or some sales management or networking experience. However, 
enough independent firms exist for a successful trader to find herself a 
position trading professionally for others.
Getting to Know the CSI Series
Almost every new career above the clerical level in the Canadian financial 
services industry includes some time spent at the Canadian Securities 
Institute Web site (www.csi.ca). This Web site is your first stop when 
your desire to trade for others turns to action; it’s where you can study the 
required courses, which we cover in the following sections.
Canadian Securities Course (CSC)
Two piles of résumés sit on the desk of every manager in the investment 
industry. Candidates in the first pile, who have already passed the Canadian 
Securities Course (CSC), are very likely to get an interview. Candidates from 
the other pile get a polite form letter recommending a visit to www.csi.ca 
sometime soon. Some exceptional professionals have begun their careers as 
clerks, and then worked their way through the ranks while studying to pass 
the CSC. Today it’s generally thought that prospective professional traders 
should have enough gumption to do the CSC on their own — after all, gumption 
is one of the key ingredients for success at trading other people’s money.
The course costs $880 (at the time of publication of this book), for which CSI 
issues a tuition tax receipt. Before there were so many useful For Dummies 
books, most of us who studied the CSC considered the textbook alone to 
be worth the value of the after-tax cost of the entire course. The course 
involves two exams, which can be written at 65 locations throughout Canada 
or overseas if required. About 150 hours of study are needed, and you have 
two years to pass. The recommended pace for the 23 lessons is one lesson a 
week.

326
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
 
The CSC is a wonderful course to study even when you don’t want to trade for 
others. While trading for yourself, it’s useful to know what the pros know. 
Your own trading skills and self-confidence will grow just from knowing what 
all the words mean. After all, it’s basically one big financial vocabulary test.
 
Don’t be put off by any fear of mathematics — all that’s required are the 
four basic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
According to the CSI, only 20 percent of those who take the course are 
business or commerce graduates.
The table of contents in the CSC textbook is similar to the one in this book. It 
ranges, as this book does, from the big picture of the global economy to the 
small picture of corporate balance sheets. You’ll learn the merits of analysis 
from top-down to bottom-up.
The subjects the course covers have grown in value and application since it 
was first set up. When Christopher studied the Canadian Securities Course 
soon after Elvis died, it wasn’t much more than a mining stock promoter’s 
guide. For example, the phrase “mutual fund” did not appear once in the text 
or index — which seemed odd at the time, because the man who practically 
invented global mutual funds, Sir John Templeton, established his Templeton 
Growth Fund right here in Canada back in 1954.
Conduct and Practices Handbook 
course (CPH)
This shorter course takes about 50 hours of study and, at time of publication, 
costs $580. This is where you learn the ropes involved behind the scenes in 
trading for others. The Conduct and Practices Handbook course delivers the 
goods from inside the investment industry, and provides lots of technical 
stuff about the do’s and don’ts surrounding handling other people’s money. 
Consider it a guide to the red tape of the trading world.
Other CSI courses
CSI offers several other courses that professionals are required to pass in 
order to deal in other financial instruments. A sample of these courses all 
have self-explanatory titles:
 
✓ Commodities as Investments (CAI)
 
✓ Canadian Insurance Course (CIC)
 
✓ Options Strategies Course (OSTC)

327
 Chapter 20: Trading for Others: Obtaining Trading Designations and Certifications
The bosses who run the investment dealers where traders look after other 
people’s money have their own set of courses provided by CSI, namely:
 
✓ Branch Managers Course (BMC)
 
✓ Options Supervisors Course (OPSC)
 
✓ Partners, Directors and Senior Officers Course (PDO)
 
✓ Chief Financial Officer Qualifying Examination (CFO)
Imagine being paid to do something you really like doing. Imagine turning a 
hobby into a serious business for which a huge demand exists, and it grows 
every year. Imagine making money for yourself by making other people 
happy. Trading for others isn’t exactly shooting fish in a barrel. Frustrations 
do pop up, of course, along with risks aplenty if you lose your focus or your 
attention to detail. However, you can see how trading professionally can 
become an addictive pleasure.
The ABCs of Financial Advisers
When you get a business card from an investment adviser or other investment 
professional, you may see a long list of initials that indicate professional 
certifications. Some of these require extensive training, education, and 
testing, but others require only minimal education and testing. In addition to 
the initial testing, some require continuing education and offer a disciplinary 
process and ways to check on a professional’s status online. The sections 
that follow break down the key designations for financial advisers and 
explain what it takes to get — and keep — the designation.
Chartered Financial Analyst
A Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation is issued by the CFA 
Institute (www.cfainstitute.org). Before you can get this designation, 
you must meet educational and work experience requirements. Candidates 
can have either an undergraduate degree plus three years of professional 
experience involving investment decision making, or four years of qualified 
work experience.
In addition to the work requirements, candidates must complete 250 hours of 
self-study for each of these three levels of examination:
 
✓ Level I, which focuses on investment evaluation and portfolio 
management

328
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
 
✓ Level II, which focuses on applying the analytical tools for valuing 
investments
 
✓ Level III, which focuses on the entire portfolio-management process
Many CFA candidates fulfill their work experience requirements while they 
prepare to take the three required exams.
Certified Financial Planner
A Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation is awarded by the Financial 
Planner Standards Council (www.fpsc.org). Candidates must meet work 
experience and educational requirements. To be recognized as a CFP, 
candidates must have three years of personal financial experience plus two 
levels of financial planning exams.
In addition to the work experience requirements, CFP candidates must either 
complete a CFP board-registered program or qualify to take the final CFP 
examination by having earned one of the following designations:
 
✓ Certified General Accountant (CGA)
 
✓ Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU)
 
✓ Chartered Accountant (CA)
 
✓ Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)
 
✓ A doctoral (PhD) degree in business, finance, or economics
Mandatory courses include financial planning process and insurance, 
investment planning, income tax planning, retirement planning and employee 
benefits, and estate planning. After earning the CFP designation, planners 
must complete 30 hours of continuing education every two years thereafter 
to maintain their CFP status.
Chartered Life Underwriter
The Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) designation has been issued since 1927 
by The American College (www.theamericancollege.edu) and focuses on 
insurance and coursework. Candidates must complete three years of full-time 
related business experience, five core courses, and three elective courses. 
Core courses include insurance and financial planning, individual life insurance, 

329
 Chapter 20: Trading for Others: Obtaining Trading Designations and Certifications
life insurance law, fundamentals of estate planning, and planning for business 
owners and professionals. The three elective courses can be chosen from 
courses on individual health insurance, income taxation, group benefits, 
planning for retirement needs, investments, and estate planning applications. 
After earning this designation, consultants must take 30 credits of continuing 
education courses every two years to maintain their status as a CLU.
Chartered Market Technician
The Chartered Market Technician (CMT) is issued by the Market Technicians 
Association (www.mta.org). Candidates must be a member of the association 
to enter the CMT program. To become a member, a person must be 
employed professionally as an analyst or professional investment manager 
for five years. Membership must be maintained in the MTA to get and hold 
the CMT certification. Certification includes three exams. The first is a 
multiple-choice exam on the basic definitions related to technical analysis. 
The second is also a multiple-choice exam that tests the candidate’s ability to 
apply advanced analytical techniques. The third exam can be satisfied with 
either a research paper or an essay exam related to portfolio strategies or 
trading decisions.
Personal Financial Planner
The Personal Financial Planner (PFP) is a professional designation issued by 
the Financial Planning Standards Council (FPSC). These exams are offered by 
the Canadian Securities Institute (www.csi.ca). Topics covered on the PFP 
exam include professional responsibilities, personal financial planning 
processes, personal income tax planning, risk management planning, 
investment planning, retirement planning, and estate planning. In addition, 
candidates must submit references and other documentation that proves 
their business experience in personal financial planning–related services.
Registered Financial Planner
The Registered Financial Planner (RFP) designation is issued by the Institute 
of Advanced Financial Planners (www.iafp.ca). In addition to the educational 
requirement, candidates must meet licensing requirements for securities and 
life and health insurance. After an RFP designation, planners must complete 
30 hours of continuing education each year.

The Designations and Certifications 
You Need When Trading for Others
If you decide you want to trade for others as well as for yourself, you need to 
become a registered representative. The most comprehensive test you can 
take is the CSI’s Canadian Securities Course Exam, and you’ll need a sponsoring 
dealer. Then you take the Conduct and Practices Handbook (CPH) exam.
This licence enables you to purchase and/or sell all securities products, 
including corporate securities, government securities, mutual funds, 
investment company products, and shares of public companies. Most of the 
other representative exams are taken whenever you want to sell only a 
specific type of security rather than the broader options that a CSC designation 
enables you to market. Professional certifications are not required to sell 
securities. All pros who seek these certifications do so to show their clients 
they have attained a level of proficiency and met or exceeded the standards 
within their specialties.
As you read through the requirements and courses mentioned in this 
chapter, you may have found subjects that can help you improve the 
management of your own funds. Many courses that train people for professional 
designations provide ways for others like you to take the coursework, even 
if you don’t plan to get the licence or certification. You can even study for 
many of these courses at home online. Two schools that offer online 
education services in the securities and financial adviser area are the 
Canadian Securities Institute (www.csi.ca) and Foran Financial (www.
foranfinancial.com).
 
As you probably realize by now, selling securities is a highly regulated field 
that requires considerable training and probation before you can sell even 
your first share. Although some people privately trade for others, they risk the 
possibility of an investigation by their provincial regulators whenever they do 
so without registering at the provincial level. Be sure the trading activities 
you do for others fit within the law, or you can end up in a legal mess facing 
significant fines.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
W
e join in the For Dummies tradition of showing you 
some special lists of ten (or so) important and key 
factors that help you with your trading. We review ten 
common and huge trading mistakes and how to avoid 
them, and we describe ten basic strategies necessary for 
your survival and long-term financial well-being as a 
trader.

Chapter 21
Ten (Or More) Huge 
Trading Mistakes
In This Chapter
▶ Trying to trade bottoms and tops (no, this isn’t X-rated)
▶ Becoming attached to your trading systems and your stocks
▶ Making decisions on the fly
▶ Losing too much
T
his chapter introduces you to ten (more, actually) huge trading mistakes 
that befall experienced and novice traders. We offer suggestions for 
helping you recognize the mistakes and for avoiding and even correcting them.
Fishing for Bottoms
Bottom fishing — trying to catch a stock as it bottoms out — is a great way to 
get soaked and lose a bucketful of money. In a bear market, stocks get much 
cheaper than most of us ever expect or want. They won’t stop falling until 
they’ve run out of gas.
The psychology of a bear market is perverse. As long as traders remain 
interested in a stock, many are the moments when it seems like the stock 
may recover. The thing is, stocks rarely turn on a dime and head higher. Only 
after the momentum crowd loses interest does the stock’s downward price 
slide end. When value investors, who can’t resist a bargain, begin nibbling, 
the stock begins to stabilize; however, it also may spend a very long time 
bouncing around in a trading range.
Traders have few, if any, reasons for entering the market when a stock is 
trading in a range. Your best opportunity for profit occurs when the stock 
breaks out of its trading range. Chapter 9 shows how to identify these trading-
range breakout patterns. Instead of risking your trading capital on unreliable 
bottoming patterns, wait until you’re sure.

Timing the Top
Tops and bottoms share something in common. They rarely arrive when 
they’re supposed to. When traders and investors are exuberant, they keep 
buying even after doing so no longer makes fundamental sense. That’s why 
shorting a stock that’s trending higher makes no sense, even if its price is far 
beyond reasonable.
You don’t have to have a lengthy memory or an encyclopedic knowledge of 
stock market history to remember what happened to Internet stocks in the 
late 1990s. Those were heady days. Stocks went in only one direction — up. 
Some of those magically levitating companies had modest revenues, but 
few had earnings. Remember, Nortel — supposedly Canada’s greatest ever 
company — went from $1,000+ per share to zero! Nevertheless, traders bid 
hundreds of dollars per share for some worthless junk. Just like the recent 
housing bubble, Internet stocks were a case of mass hysteria, mob mentality, 
market madness, or all three.
Call it what you will; when a bubble is inflating definitely is not a time to short 
related stocks. Sure, these stocks eventually crashed and burned, but not 
before depleting the trading accounts of a den full of bearish short sellers. Don’t 
guess. Wait for reliable trading signals, like the ones discussed in Chapters 9 
and 10, before entering a position.
You might be asking whether reliable trading signals occurred before the 
Internet bubble burst. Not before; traders aren’t fortune tellers (see Chapter 8). 
However, the risks at the time were well known. And when stocks began head-
ing lower early in 2000, you might have had all the information you needed 
to protect your profits and trading capital, and begin selling short. Lots of 
signals that the market was set for another fall were also there in early 2008. 
Chapter 13 uses the Nasdaq bubble as an example to show how to evaluate 
market risk and adjust your trading strategy as the market transitions from 
a rising to a falling market.
Trading Against the Dominant Trend
Trading against the dominant trend in the market leads to costly mistakes. 
Unfortunately, misidentifying the trend by focusing on the chart in front of 
you and forgetting to look at the next higher level chart is an easy thing to 
do. You may see a promising uptrend occur with a pullback on the intraday 

335
 Chapter 21: Ten (Or More) Huge Trading Mistakes
charts. But on the daily chart, the trend you saw on the intraday chart actually 
turns out to be a consolidation rally during a strong downtrend. The promising 
pullback actually is the beginning of the next leg down on the daily chart. If 
you buy long in a situation like this one, hoping to capture the next leg up, 
your position will be swamped (and so will your trading capital) by the flood 
of sell orders coming from traders who recognize the implications of the 
longer-term stronger trend.
Regardless of the specific indications of the chart you’re looking at, always 
confirm your analysis by looking at charts that are one time period higher. 
For example, if you’re studying daily charts, confirm your analysis on the 
weekly charts. If you’re studying intraday charts, confirm your analysis on 
the daily charts. Always know which part of the market cycle you’re in and 
what types of industries excel in that part of the cycle. See Chapters 10 and 
13 for additional information.
Don’t try to buy based on a brief intraday move, when the dominant trend 
on the daily charts is down. Doing so is a great way of giving up your trading 
capital to someone else.
Winging It
Traders get into big trouble when they wing it. Maybe you heard the guy on 
business TV say the stock was hot and heading higher. Maybe you saw the 
news that a new product was bound to be a big hit. Although that may sound 
like great information, it’s only a reason to look into the fundamental and 
technical conditions of a company’s stock. It’s not a reason to buy today.
Devise a strategy. We think that’s such great advice, we’ll say it again. Devise 
a strategy. Develop and test a trading system that matches your goals and 
personality (see Chapter 15). Plan your trades and execute your plan. Wait 
patiently for your signals to trigger your trades. Pick your entry and exit 
points before entering your order. Have a plan and stick to it.
Traders also get into trouble when they start second-guessing their trading 
plans. Sometimes, even in the middle of executing a trade, you need to make 
a decision but won’t be sure which decision is right.
When in doubt, close the position. It’s easier to think clearly when your 
money isn’t at risk. You can always buy back the stock if further analysis 
confirms it’s the right thing to do.

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Taking Trading Personally
A losing trade is bad for your trading account, but you can’t let it get to you. 
Sure, it makes you feel bad, but a losing trade doesn’t impugn your honour 
or disparage your heritage. A bad trade may reduce your net worth, but it 
shouldn’t damage your self-esteem. Entering a losing trade certainly doesn’t 
mean you’re a nincompoop or a blockhead — any more than closing a winning 
trade signals your brilliance and mastery of all you survey.
The market isn’t out to get you; it’s out to get your money. Don’t take trading 
personally. A losing trade is just another losing trade. You’ll have plenty of 
them. Get used to it.
Falling in Love
Trading is a business. Your stocks are your inventory. Smart business owners 
don’t fall in love with their inventory. It’s there to sell, at a profit if possible, 
at a loss if necessary. And smart businesspeople don’t fall in love with their 
business models. If it isn’t working, they change it; otherwise, they’ll be out of 
business before you can say “liquidation sale.”
When you fall in love with your stock, you risk large losses. When you fall 
in love with your trading plan, you risk many more losses. It’s easy to fall in 
love. After doing hours of research and analysis, you want to be right. You 
want your trades and your trading plans to generate profits, but hoping 
doesn’t make it so.
Be smart. Don’t fall in love. Your trading system doesn’t have feelings and 
your stock won’t love you back. Be prepared to jettison positions and trading 
systems that don’t do what they’re supposed to do. Stocks are not family. 
They’re not even friends. They are tools, just like hammers and wheelbarrows. 
Love your family and your friends and your faith — do NOT love your stocks! 
See Chapter 12 for more about trading as a business and effectively managing 
your inventory.
Using After-Hours Market Orders
When the market opens and it’s off to the races, the market order you placed 
last night before going to bed is going to be swept up in a wave of frantic 
trading. Bad fills are sure to be the result. You’re likely to pay considerably 
more to buy a stock you want or to sell one for considerably less than you’d 

337
 Chapter 21: Ten (Or More) Huge Trading Mistakes
planned. You should very seldom place a market order when entering trades 
after the market is closed (after-hours). Instead, define how much you’re 
willing to buy or sell a stock for by using a stop order, a limit order, or a 
stop-limit order. Chapter 14 discusses the mechanics of entering these types 
of orders.
Chasing a Runaway Trend
If you miss the breakout entry point for a stock that you want, waiting is 
better than entering a position as a trend accelerates. See Chapter 10 for 
information about identifying and trading a trend. Often, stocks will pull back 
and test the breakout point. Wait for that point, or wait for the stock to take 
a short breather after its first leg up. If you’re still interested, that’s a better 
entry point than chasing a stock as it accelerates into the trend. Like a fine 
wine, you sometimes need to let a stock breathe.
On the other hand, if you already have a position in a runaway stock, try 
planning your exit so that you leave a little money on the table. Capturing 
every last nickel of the trend is almost impossible anyway, so don’t try. 
Instead, consider trimming your position as the stock reaches for the 
stratosphere. If you’re using margin, consider taking some profit off the 
table and reducing your leverage a bit. We discuss this strategy further in 
Chapter 13, and we cover the mechanics of using margin in Chapter 14. When 
a runaway stock stops going up and everyone wants out at the same time, the 
speed at which the price falls is remarkable. Be ready to jettison stocks that 
rally too fast at the first sign of trouble.
Averaging Down
Averaging down is a below-average idea. You sometimes hear advisers 
suggesting it as a way of reducing your cost basis, but it’s merely a technique 
to throw good money after bad. The logic of averaging down is usually 
contrary to the logic of trading. Traders sell losers. They don’t reward them 
with infusions of trading capital.
However, averaging up sometimes makes sense. Traders call it pyramiding. 
The idea is to add to your winning positions when your trading system triggers 
new trading signals in the direction of the trend. Pyramiding is a good way 
of building a large position in a strongly trending stock. Be aware of the risk, 
though. The larger your position, the more it hurts when the trend ends and 
the stock’s price begins to fall. Be ready to trim your pyramid position at the 
first sign of trouble.

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Ignoring Your Stops
Talking yourself out of honouring your stops is an easy thing to do. You’ll be 
tempted when a trade goes against you. You’ll look at your indicators and the 
support levels on your charts, and you’ll be certain that the stock soon will 
stop falling. When you start thinking you want to give a position a little room 
to work its way out of losing territory, you’re on your way toward a trading 
debacle. It’s wishful thinking, it’s hoping against hope, and it’s a good way to 
lose a lot of money. Unless you’re omniscient, close the position when the 
price hits your stop. Take your loss. Chapter 14 discusses stop orders and 
how to use them.
Diversifying Badly
Exposing all your capital in one trade is a bad idea, and so is trading hundreds 
of stocks simultaneously. A happy medium can be found somewhere in 
between.
You can monitor only so many positions and do it well. You need only so 
many positions to diversify your risk. And although you can have too few or 
too many stocks in your trading portfolio, no perfect number — one that is 
right for every trader — exists. That said, you nevertheless have to figure 
out what the right number is for you. Start with 10 or 15 positions. You may 
end up deciding that eight is enough. However, unless you have an extremely 
large portfolio, imagining why you’d need any more than 20 positions is difficult.
The simple wisdom is this: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. And don’t 
chop your eggs into little pieces and spread them across many dozens of 
baskets. You want to diversify, just not too much.
Enduring Large Losses
To trade is to lose. No matter how good your trading system is, no matter 
how experienced you are, and no matter which stocks you pick, you’re going 
to have losing trades. Your success as a trader depends on how you handle 
those losing trades. If you dispose of the losers quickly, you can become a 
very successful trader. But if you hold on to those losing positions, you can 
lose so much money that it may knock you right out of the trading business.

339
 Chapter 21: Ten (Or More) Huge Trading Mistakes
Using margin (see Chapter 14) exacerbates the problem of losing trades. 
Margin is a wonderful thing, because with careful application it can magnify 
your profits. But on the flip side, with indiscriminate use it can also magnify 
your losses. If you want to turn your pool of trading capital into a puddle, 
leverage a lot of losing trades.
Small losses won’t hurt you much, but large losses will. If you use margin and 
fail to cut your losses, you won’t be a trader for long.

Top Ten Trading Survival 
Techniques
In This Chapter
▶ Building your tool chest
▶ Understanding and using averages
▶ Developing your own trading system
▶ Taking profits and avoiding losses
▶ Buying on strength, selling on weakness
▶ Reviewing your journal
T
rading is not a risk-free activity. Although all traders know that losses 
are inevitable, they want to minimize those losses and be around to 
trade another day. In this chapter, we review ten of the top trading survival 
techniques that can help you enter the world of trading and enable you to 
continue to trade for a long time to come.
Build Your Trading Tool Chest
Before you buy that first share, that first option or futures contract, or any 
other security, you need to be certain you have the right mix of trading 
software, hardware, and Internet access to be successful. You need the 
right tools to identify trading candidates; display and interpret charts; 
research trading opportunities; screen stocks for technical or fundamental 
constraints; and monitor and analyze your portfolio, open positions, market 
indexes, sectors, and trading statistics. In summary, the proper tools are 
critical to finding the right trades and then monitoring those positions after 
you’ve found and entered them.

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Even after you’ve found them, if you don’t have the right tools you may not 
be able to enter and exit positions efficiently, control or track your orders, 
track your profits and losses, analyze your trading history, or monitor 
economic reports, earnings, and other business news.
The proper tools help you evaluate your trading system and test your trading 
ideas. They enable you to keep logs to review your trading performance. You 
also can use tools to stay in touch with other traders and exchange ideas 
that ultimately may help you improve your trading skills and discover new 
opportunities.
Tools are the core of any good trader’s business. Without the right ones, 
your chances of success drop dramatically. Don’t skimp on the tools you 
select for your trading activities. (For more information, see Chapter 4.)
Use Both Technical and 
Fundamental Analyses
You may have heard that all traders use technical analysis and believe that 
fundamental analysis is a waste of time. Don’t believe it. Although technical 
analysis is crucial to finding the right entry and exit points, fundamental 
analysis improves your ability to make the right stock choices, given market 
and economic conditions.
You’ll find as a trader that knowing the current state of the economy and the 
state of the market is critical. You obviously want to buy stocks in the bull 
market and sell them, or short them, in a bear market, but do you know how 
to recognize when the market is entering a period of transition so you can 
make your moves when the opportunity for making profitable trades or 
minimizing potential losses is greatest?
Using a combination of fundamental and technical analyses, your chances 
of identifying bull and bear markets and finding phases of transition and 
consolidation improve dramatically. Your best trading opportunities are 
at the beginning of these phases of change, so be sure you understand the 
six phases of the market and know which sectors offer you the best trading 
opportunities within each of those phases. (For more information, see Parts 
II and III.)

343
 Chapter 22: Top Ten Trading Survival Techniques
Choose — and Use — Your 
Favourite Tools Wisely
As you begin sorting out your software and hardware and making contact 
with other traders, you’ll probably find out about the hundreds of tools and 
charts that are out there on the market. You don’t need to learn and use 
them all. Using too many tools can be as dangerous to your trading system 
and your sanity as using too few. You’ll find you get mixed signals and will 
probably end up in a state of analysis paralysis trying to figure out which tool 
is giving you the right signal.
To avoid driving yourself crazy, pick the top two or three trading tools that 
make sense to you and fit your trading style. Take your time getting to know 
how they work and how best to interpret the information they generate. Use 
them to build the types of charts that match your trading style and don’t 
worry about learning all the new gadgets. If your tools are working and you’re 
making a good profit, don’t rush to add the newest innovation tool.
Keep your eyes open for new tools that can improve your trading profits, 
but use caution before making changes to your winning trading system. (For 
more information, see Chapter 15.)
Count on the Averages to 
Make Your Moves
You may think that using data from averages to find the right time to enter 
or exit a position is counterintuitive, but moving averages can be powerful 
trading indicators. Moving averages actually smooth out the data for you 
visually and help you identify any trends. Although they cannot predict the 
future, they nevertheless help you understand the past so you can more 
effectively extrapolate what may happen to a stock in the future.
Traders use many different types of moving averages in hundreds of different 
ways. Stock closing prices are the most common data being averaged, but 
any value on a price chart can be smoothed for interpretation. For example, 
traders sometimes manipulate the moving averages by using the mid-point 
between the high and low prices to develop the moving average. Others look 
for the moving average using the open, high, or low price. It’s all a matter 
of trading style and how the charts you’re developing match your trading 
system.

344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Be sure to find out how to use moving averages and what they mean. After 
you understand them and what goes into them, you can manipulate moving 
averages to your advantage and to coincide with your trading style. Moving 
averages are powerful indicators, but they’re not the only type of indicator 
you need to use in choosing your trades; use moving averages in conjunction 
with other indicators. (For more information, see Chapter 11.)
Develop and Manage Your 
Trading System
You need to have a road map that helps you find buy and sell signals for 
your trades. A trading system is such a map, because it’s developed using a 
collection of tools created from technical and fundamental analyses woven 
together to let you know when it’s time to enter or exit positions. You can 
buy trading systems off the shelf, but these systems are available to thousands 
of others who ultimately will end up with the same buy and sell signals.
To be able to trade outside the pack, you need to develop your own trading 
system, using your own favourite tools. Although you can use tools provided 
in off-the-shelf software packages, you want to develop and adapt a trading 
system that fits uniquely with your personality and trading objectives.
After initially developing and testing your own trading system, your work 
is not done. You’ll need to constantly monitor your system’s successes and 
failures and look for ways to make improvements. (For more information, see 
Chapter 15.)
Know Your Costs
Trading isn’t cheap. Not only do you have to worry about commissions or 
transaction fees, you also must watch for any slippage in your trades. Even 
though you may be using stop or limit orders, you rarely end up executing 
trades at the exact entry or exit prices you plan. Some slippage, or the 
difference between the quoted price and the actual price for the security, 
is bound to occur, so you need to be sure you carefully monitor your 
commission costs, transaction fees, and slippage costs.
In addition, don’t forget to consider the tax man. If you’re trading stocks, any 
profits you make are taxed at 50 percent of your net capital gains — unless 
you use a tax-free or tax-deferred account.

345
 Chapter 22: Top Ten Trading Survival Techniques
Traders must also avoid being caught by wash superficial loss rules. Most 
trading losses can be used to offset trading gains and thus reduce your 
income tax burden, but if you sell a stock for a loss and repurchase the 
same stock within 30 days, your trading loss for that transaction cannot be 
deducted. You have to wait until you sell the stock again and use any losses 
to reduce the cost basis of the trade, which reduces the tax owed when the 
position is finally closed. (For more information, see Chapters 2 and 14.)
Know When to Hold ’Em 
and When to Fold ’Em
Knowing when to take your profits and get out and when to accept your 
losses and close a position before it becomes even more damaging can be 
among the hardest lessons any trader must learn. All too often you’re enticed 
by the win and want to ride it to the absolute top.
Wise traders plan their exit points at the top and bottom of each position long 
before they ever enter that position. And, more importantly, they stick to their 
plan. Getting caught up in the emotions of a winning trade is easy, but don’t 
forget you’re operating a business. Take your profits when you reach your 
goal and get out, so you don’t risk turning a winning position into a loss.
When you make a mistake, own up to it quickly, take your hit, and get out 
of the position. If the stock recovers, you can always reenter the position at 
a later time. Don’t ride a stock to the bottom just to try to prove you were 
right. Plan your exit points before you buy and stick to them. (For more 
information, see Chapter 12.)
Watch for Signals, Don’t 
Anticipate Them
After you make a decision to buy a stock, you may find that you’re impatient 
to actually get into that position. You start watching the charts and waiting for 
the right signal to buy. Often, you’ll see charts move close to your planned 
signal but not actually reach it.
Be patient. Wait for the signal you’ve designated in your plan. Don’t anticipate 
any moves, even if the stock price is getting close to that point on your 
charts. You may miss the perfect entry point, but you’ll be less likely to make 

346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
that fatal mistake of entering a position before the signal is triggered only to 
see your stock reverse course and thus be forced to take a loss. (For more 
information, see Chapters 10 and 13.)
Buy on Strength, Sell on Weakness
Buy on strength and sell on weakness is a mantra you’ve probably heard 
frequently from investment and trading gurus. The reason for its popularity 
is a good one: It works! And it needs to become your trading way of life.
When you see a stock showing strength and heading into an uptrend, it’s 
time to buy. When you see a stock falling and showing signs of entering a 
weakening period, it’s time to sell. If a weak stock takes a turn for the better, 
you can always reenter the position. (For more information, see Chapter 13.)
Keep a Trading Journal 
and Review It Often
One of the only ways you can ever improve your trading skills is by keeping 
track of what works and what doesn’t and trying to gauge why. After each 
trade, take the time to write down the details of the trade and what went 
right and/or wrong with that trade. You can improve only what you measure, 
so measure everything and put it in your trading journal.
Don’t forget to review the contents of your journal every week. You may 
find that reviewing your successes is enjoyable but reviewing your failures 
is difficult. Failure, however, sometimes is the best teacher. Many people 
discover more from their failures than from their successes. Try figuring out 
why your failed trades didn’t work and what you could’ve done to improve 
your results. Of course, don’t ignore your successes. After all, you need to 
know what works and why and then try to incorporate those winning 
strategies more consistently into your trading system. (For more information, 
see Chapter 15.)

between stocks that are range bound and ones that are trending
