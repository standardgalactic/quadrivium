Stewart Bell of Electronic Zoo proves that he
certainly isn't scared of making a prat of himself.
GERMAN
HERMAN
Coldit, that yonks old
boardgame that you used to
lose all the cards and
counters for when you were
younger, and you always
wanted another copy of as
you grew up because you
remembered it to be a right
stanker of a game, especially
when all your friends came
round to play, is soon to hit
the C64 care of Digital Magic
Software.
The company, who hails
from the ever-so-trendy
nightspot of Widnes, has
sent us some wonderful
promotion pictures of the
staff going ape-bonkers-
crazy with Germanic Nazi
uniforms on and leaping
around a local church
pretending to be
soldiers/convicts (ie. Tony
Adams) during the war.
Apparently these were shot
in a church because it was
the nearest local landmark
3
that resembled Colditz.
Unfortunately it looks about
as convincing as one of
Jeremy Beadle's false
beards. If you want the right
atmosphere you should try
your local NHS hospital, then
you'll be going some way as
to the agony the soldiers
were going through.
One thing stands out
though, apart from the fact
that the game looks brill, is
that the commie 64 version is
being programmed by Ste
Pattullo, the guy who also
supplied you lucky lot with
Limbo and Limbo II (games
on our previous tapes), so
you can bet you'll be getting
some wicked code (by the
way Ste's the one with the
long coat on, who's leaping
the wall in the piccy).
Look out for our review
pretty shortly.
SMASHING,
SUPER,
GREAT!
Ocean has smashed and
grabbed the rights to
convert the popular
Williams' coin-op Smash
TV.
The Gauntlet-style
four player coin op
which, if you don't
already know, is a
futuristic, overhead
view, combat game full
of weapons'n violence. It
promises to be a real
stonker too, being
programmed by Probe
and it should reach the
shops by the middle of
the year... um,
smashing!
Also planned for
Chrimbo next year is
Terminator 2, which is to
be based on the new
movie of the same name
starring Arnold
Schwarzenegger and
Billy Idol. Being the
sequel to one of the best
written science ﬁction
thrillers you can bet that
it'll be as action packed
as a walk through a
Beirut park.

Spectravideo, the ﬁrm that
used to market Quickshot
joysticks, has launched a
new joystick
manufacturing company
called Logic 3. And to
celebrate the fact the
company is launching
Sting-ray (I wonder if Gerry
Anderson knows all about
it), a joystick that looks a
bit like a hair-dryer but will
help you wipe them aliens
as fast as you can say
Spectravivvi... erm...

Logic 3 is so proud of

Spectravideo boss, Ashvin
Patel, said "We see Logic

Elite's jumping platform
puzzle game is to make an
explosive reappearance,
promising to be bigger
and meatier than the
previous two Bombjack
games, with a playing area
covering 17 levels and
incorporating over 250
adventure screens.
Mighty Bombjack,
which is to be released
about now (priced
E9.99/E12.99) is likely to
be bouncing up to No. 1 in
the charts in a similar
fashion to its two
predecessors.
3 as the BMW of the
joystick world and the
Sting-ray is the ultimate
zapping machine." Aarghl
If Logic 3's the BMW then
who's the Rolls Royce?
And who would own up to
being the Reliant Robin?
Only time will tell, but
catch the next issue of YC
- the Ferrari of the
newsagents - for a joystick
round-up where we'll sort
the Skodas from the
Porches.
Incidentally, the Sting-
ray will be priced at C14.95
for a standard quality
version, and E15.95 if you
want autof ire as well.
JOY TO THE WORLD
12" REMOC
Not to be left out, Active
Distribution has signed a
marketing agreement with
Champ joysticks in the U. S.
of A. This means that all
those stonky games tools
that the yanks have been
using and enjoying so much,
will now be available in Fred
Bloggs' comer software
emponum.
The ﬁrst for us commie
owners will be the Yoke - a
yoke style joysticky, of
course, with full throttle
control, a ﬁre button on each
arm full 60 degrees turn, and
thumb screws to clamp onto
table (or to re-enact the
Spanish Inquisition on your
Grandad when he's asleep). I
This will undoubtedly make
F-16 Combat Pilot a dam
better game (could it be any
better than it is now?), but for
the chunky price of E49.99
you'd better have lost of
wonga in your pocket.

COCK UPS MEW
Erm... Er... When we
got the last issue back
we were quite
surprised that there
was a humungous big
cock-up involving two
of the pages.
The pages in
question are 33 and
36, where not only has
the end of the
Accolade In Action
review been mislaid,
but the page that was
originally supposed to
be printed on page 36
has been split into two
wrong halves and
distributed over the
two pages in question.
We hope that this has
not impaired your
enjoyment of YC (it
probably made to roll
about the ﬂoor in
laughter) and we
promise that those
responsible will be
beaten about the head
and goolies with a very
large stick.
For those who were
interested in the
Accolade review the
overall score for the
compilation was 75%
and it is recommended
for those who are after
a brill racing game or a
superb American
Footy sim.
Oh, by the way,
pages 64 and 65 in
that issue were
swapped around too!
Sorry!!!

RIK'S AN 'IN' SORT OF CHAPPIE
This year's In-Din was held
at the Intercontinental
Hotel in London and is the
industty's Shin-Dig and
awards ceremony
attended by the rich and
famous of computer
games companies,
maga7ines, shops and
distributors - anyone
who's anyone. On a cold
December night, Rik
(who's he?) actually took
off his jeans and dolled on
his Pierre Cardin shirt,
dickie bow and dinner
jacket. He mingled, drank,
tried to eat posh food,
drank, was entertained by
Julian Clary, drank, oh,
and represented VC!
He came back with a
headache and a crumpled
piece of paper covered in
booze with the results of
the awards for me. After
wiping them down, here
are the results:
Budget Game of the
Year -Interceptor Range.
Video Game of the
Year-John Maddens
Football, Electronic Arts.
Adventure Game of the
Year Captive, Mindscape.
Simulation of the Year

Overall Game of the
Year - Captive, Mindscape.

As you can see there
were very few awards that
went to 8-bit games and
this does not bode well for
the future.

hurrah! But you
get rid of one foul-
smelling nasty alien jobbie
and another one takes his
place. Unfortunately,
although you'd planned to
buy a small cottage on the
planet of pleasure, settle
down with a can of tuna
and raise a few ringpulls, a
distress call has been sent
from a small planet and
you're the tin man to save
it (the one out of the
Wizard of Oz was on
holiday at the time).
So it's time once again
to get out your ultimate
weapon (ooer - oops
wrong review) and
traverse the caves and
mazes that you're so
adept at. And Turrican II,
though it's very similar to
its former game, is so
much sexier and ever so
more advanced. It seems
as though all the great bits
of Turrican have been
lifted and the bits we
never liked have been
thrown out of the window
and replaced with funkier
counterparts. But how do
you make the best shoot-
em-up ever better?

because I don't know.
There's not really that
much different about
Turrican II than its prequel.
The amount of screens in
the layouts are the same,
and the playability seems
identical, but at least this
is what we want.
There will be one or
two of you who've never
heard of Turrican and the
following section is just for
you (everybody else can
go and put on their Stone
Roses LP or something
and hang loose for a
while):
Turrican II is much the
same as most platform
games apart from the fact
that the levels are
gigantic, and you have
tonnes of weaponry to
give you a better chance
against the plethora of
chunky baddies.
It's a case of ﬁght your
way through the
cavern/labyrinth and ﬁnd
the end-of level nasty,
where you'll either get
your ass well and truly
kicked (like me) or you'll
live to smeg again, and
again, and again. And
while you're travelling you
collect diamonds that give
your score a major
boost.
There's also a level of
pure shoot-em-up action
where our man in a can
leaps into a superb-zakki
ﬁghter craft, and you ﬁnd
yourself plunged into a
horizontal scroller of the
quality that only the
company behind X-Out
and Denaris could give.
It's got mega loads of
meanies to blast and the
type of pick-up-extras
gameplay that we have
come to expect. But the
main game itself offers so
much anyway that this
section is just a bonus.
As you explore, you'll
come across icons that
can be collected, and they
can give you anything
from a little bit more
energy to an extra life,
with a few scattered
death-coughing mega
blasters in between. You'll
also ﬁnd yourself with an
enormous range of
backgrounds. A lot of the
time on the earlier levels
being spent under water.
The major
improvements on the
original are the small
graphical extras and the
size of the end-of level
monsters (they truly are
monsters too). One of
which is over three
screens big, proving that
the commie can do it too,
who needs a 16-bit
machine.
The gameplay (as I've
previously mentioned) is
just the same as
Turrican's, and follows the
if it's successful churn it
out again and again'
stable. But thankfully that
was what made Turrican
great, and fortunately
Turrican II, if there's such
0But the meanies seemed to get meanie-er, and before I
knew it I was grabbed by the... big arm-type thing (you
thought I was going to say goolies, didn't you?)
a phrase, greater. The
graphics are spiffy, the
sonics are spiffy and the
game as a whole is so
gigantic that it'll take
average games players
absolutely yonks to get
anywhere. There are very
few games that are better
than this Germanic effort,
and certainly none of them
offer such joystick
mashing action.

yak! k-yak!), it's just
the job for inserting
into your ﬂoppy (Ltuuri
Lluurl), It'll keep you
waggling your joystick for
hours (Gw000aaarl
Gw000aaart), So let's take it
in hand (Sffriffkpffpl) and
give it a good probing (Wool
Wool Fnaaap! Fnaaapt.
Aaaa! Aaaa! Etc.).
It's no secret that Viz
- e n  • erson reviews the rudest,
most obscene game in the history of
the commie, and he tries to do it
without using any naughty words. It's
erm... It's er... Oh knackers!!! Let's get
on with it (Fnarr! Fnarr!)...
comic is one of the biggest
phenomenon in the last
decade. Starting as a small
fanzine sold for beer money,
within ten years it is
rumoured to be selling over
1 million copies every two
months. And this is without
the uncanny sales of
merchandise (T-Shirts,
books, etc.), add it all
together and we are talking
big wonga. But why?
It all boils down to the
average mentality of the
British adult population, they
like rudery and double
entendre, and they'll
welcome any publication
that can give it to them.
What marks Viz as a cut
above the rest though is the
fact that its humour, as
blatantly unsubtle as it
comes, is cleverly written
and splendidly drawn, and
the characters are likable for
their faults.
It's natural therefore to
grab such a licence by the
short and curlies for
pixelisation, although minors
(young people, not Arthur
Scargill) will have to wear a
false beard if they want to
have a copy all for
themselves.
But who could give us
such batey tomfoolery?
None other than Virgin
(Priam!) and Probe (K-yak!),
who have linked up before
to give us excellent comic
conversions (remember the
entire Dan Dare series!!!).
Although this time they've
taken on a much harder task
(Anybody sniggers again
and I'
The ﬁrst thing that was
decided was that the game
shouldn't be toned down to
comply with a younger
market (and quite right too).
In fact when Virgin was
asked if they wanted such a
version, its response was
"P"'"'G B K S " .  And boy
has a meaty comestible
been produced.
You play any one of the
three most popular
characters, Biffa Bacon,
Johnny Fartpants, and
Buster Gonad, and you can
choose who to adopt with
the help of a very colourful
(?) opening screen. Each
character have certain enti...
characteristics that can help
you during play. Biffa can
either punch or go into a
lager frenzy, Buster can
bounce on his overgrown
testicles, or carry them in a
wheelbarrow, and Johnny
can pump air through his
anal passage causing him to
propel himself forward (he
can either do a small guff or
a giant Boston cheer).
The aim of the main part
of the game is to race
across a horizontally
scrolling landscape,
avoiding the other Viz
characters and other
hazards, and beat your
fellow chums to the ﬁnishing
line. There are ﬁve of these
ston king levels and they get
increasingly harder as you
progress.
If you happen to stumble
upon an obstacle, you'll end
up on your posterior, do this
three times and your little
sprite will bugger off. In
between these levels are
sub games, two for each
character, and this is where
the real feel for what Viz is all
about is expressed.
If you're Johnny
Fartpants your subgames
(you can choose which one
you wish to do) are a fart up
the pole competition, to see
how high you can get by
dropping one, or you must
blow up balloons with your
rectum in time for the little
girls party.
As Biffa Bacon you can
either see how many pints

you can drink in the time
limit, or people will throw
bricks at you and you have
to head, punch or kick them
back.
Buster Gonad's ﬁrst
subgame is similar to
Johnny's, but you must
bounce your way to the top
of the pole using your
unfeasibly large knackers, or
alternatively, the pancake
machine at the Fulchester
bakery has broken down
and you can use your talents
(?) to help ﬂatten the dough.
Most of these games are
joystick wagglers (what
else?), and depending on
how well you do you'll be
awarded tokens. Each token
allows you to use one of
your extended powers, and
in any one subgame you can
earn up to 9 of them. If you
fail it doesn't matter though
'cause you'll not lose a life.
Although the gameplay
sounds a tad simple, it's the
hilarity in the graphics and
the variety of bit part
characters that impress the
most. For instance, if you
come across Shakey you'll
be sent haywire and your
controls will alter whilst he is
playing his kind of muzak.
A bonus for us Commie
owners is that Viz was
designed and originally
programmed on our
machines, so we've got the
original game, and there's
no reason why it isn't the
best version. For a start the
graphics are superb, and
they're very true to their
crude cartoon counterparts,
and there are a lot of them to
choose from. The whole of
Viz seems to be represented
apart from Billy The Fish,
because the programmer
doesn't like him, although I
feel that he could warrant a
game all to himself.
The whole package is
enhanced by the running
commentary by Roger
Me!lie, although this could
very well be the reason why
it won't be sold to those that
would appreciate the
humour most. To say that
his language is anything less
than meaty would be an
ellailacleia

Quad is Breakout with a
difference. In fact, it
should be called Break-in.
Instead of just one ﬁddly
little bat at the base of the
screen, you have four
bats, one for each side.
This time, you've got
those bricks surrounded!
You control the bats at
top and bottom with
joystick left/right, and the
left and right bats with
up/down. Unlike all other
games of this sort, you do
not lose a life if the ball
gets past your bat. In fact,
the ball never leaves the
screen - the point is to
stop it bouncing off the
side. The penalty for
letting the ball past is that
you lose a brick from the
screen.
You might think that an
advantage, since what you
need to do is get rid of the
bricks. But no, because
the brick lost does not
count towards your score,
and reduces the number
left for you to score on.
Since you need a certain
number of bricks to get on
the next screen each time,
this can lead you to be
trapped at the same level
66111611
all over again.
The counters at the top
of the screen will give you
an idea of your current
situation. The Need ﬁgure
shows you how many
bricks you want to get to
the next frame, and the
Got ﬁgure shows you how
many you have towards
your total. If you are in a
frame, you must still clear
all bricks present to
progress.
However, you must be
careful that you don't lose
enough penalty points to
drop the need ﬁgure
below that you need to
complete the frame,
otherwise you'll have to do
it all over again. Devilish,
eh?
If, in the process of
clearing the screen, the
Got counter drops to zero,
or on completing a screen
you fail to achieve the
Need value, one life will be
lost. Lives are shown by
the smiling faces. When all
three are gone, the game
ends. No extra lives will be
given.
There are eight screens
in ail, and besides this, the
game offers a number of
options. It can be played
with one or two
players - one player
controlling the
left/right bat, the
other controlling
the up/down. The
bat size can be
made large or
small, or the ball
speed made fast or
slow. All these
options are chosen
after the game has
loaded as follows:
Fl - Number of
players. Toggles
between one and
two.
F3 - Bat size.
Toggles between
large and small.
F5 - Bat speed.
Toggles between
fast and slow.
F7 - Starts

It is said that in the Bazair
system, somewhere on the
Galactic Rim, there are
nine planets, each more
inaccessible than the last.
On each planet is a city,
and in each city is an
electronic key of such a
nature that it can be used
to command the ship
that will carry the
fortunate traveller to the
next city inwards. It is
also said that in the ninth
city will be found the key
to the mastery of all time
and space.
None have come into

planets. The key to each
city is in each case
protected by fast moving
robot guardians. Should a
questing hero wish to
remain non-posthumous
they were wise to step
swiftly.
Once in possession of
the key, the voyager's
problems will start. For
each of the craft that will
be needed to penetrate
further into the system is
protected by a lake of
mineral acid so corrosive
that it will reduce a living
being to a solution of ions
in milliseconds. A network
of ﬂoating platforms pass
over the dreaded lake, and
swiftness and dexterity
will be needed to master
the pattern of their
movement. But stay - pity
the unfortunate venturer
who travels then inwards
on the ethereal winds. For
between each of the
planets is a zone of
asteroids of unusual
density and possessing
most unpredictable orbits.

these sort of
sideways scrolling,
axe wielding chop 'em ups
is the coherent plot, the
believable characters and
the witty repartee. So the
kingdom of Yuria
(pronounced "your ear" by
the way) is in danger of
something or other, with
the royal family being put
to the sword (good thing
too if you ask me), and
reptiles running the land.
Probably.
Well, its down to you,
Mr Axe-Battler (ﬂashback
20 years: So what are we
going to call our son then,
asks Mrs Battler. Dunno,
says Mr Battler, fondling
his axe. How about Axe ?),
you Mr Gilius
Thunderhead (the midget),
or you Ms Tyris Flame
(recently orphaned
Amazon warrior queen
with Maria Whittaker
proportions and a bottom
nibbling thong), to kill all of
Death Adder's troops, and
then kill the main lizard
himself. Complex stuff
huh?
Up to two players can
plod along simultaneously,
which gives you a great
advantage since only one
enemy seems to appear at
once (programming
problems and all that), and
starting in the woods just
outside turtle village
(groan), off you go, cutting
a bloody swathe towards
the castle containing Mr
Death Adder.
So its been done many
times before, at least the
action is entertaining (if
you like kicking, chopping
and maiming - which I do),
the graphics are
respectable enough, and it
all progresses with
a weary
inevitability. Fine,

Codemasters
games on one
cartridon
ree of the
best
Microprose
games now on
the GS.
MYTH
System 3's
award winning
arcade
adventure.
VENDETTA
The meanest
game of 1990
now arrives on
cart.
Biggest shock of the
month revolves
around the
announcement by US
Gold that they're NOT
going to be releasing
the famous Epyx
Games series of
games. This seems a
great shame seeing as
this much acclaimed
series is perfect to be
converted and would
suit a cart well.
Other US Gee carts
to come will be (aswell
as those mentioned
last issue) Ghouls 'n'
Ghosts and UN
Squadron.
Domark's new
releases are actually
old ones. Along with
Vindicators (as noted
last month) we've got
Badlands and
Cyberball - a game
that we reviewed
absolutely yonks ago
and never appeared
on tape or disk.
System 3 are not just
happy with converting
the company's
existing product, all
future C64 games will
support the machine
that has already
blasted one
competitor out of the
water. IK Deluxe is the
sequel to International
Karate +, and will be
also programmed by
Archer MacLean. We
also have the second
Myth game, and that's
just for starters.

ow this is what the
cartridge should
be used for. Just
imagine it, a ﬂick of a
switch and three games
are all waiting for you to
play instantly. Once
you've chosen one you
go straight into it, and if
you wish to change your
mind at any point, just
switch the machine off
and on again and you've
got another choice.
The only fault that
Fun Play has is that it's a
collection of three
Codemasters games,
which would normally
retail for about E2.99
each. And seeing as
none of them are multi-
loaders, it's not as if the
bonuses are that fruitful.
Let's have a look at the
games then...
Pro Tennis
Ern.. Er... Not exactly
the best tennis game in the history of the
commie, but not the worst either. It seems

to be rather okay in the
playability stakes, but a
tad too hard, and a tad
too crap.

This is the highlight of
the three games and is
as good now as when I
reviewed it yonks ago.

like
andPacman, but it has trillions of levels
they range in difﬁculty from very, very
easy to you must be joking. It's
pretty much a stiffy.
Pro Skateboard
Again a bit crap, and very budget
gamey (whatever that is). You have
to race down a hill, collecting ﬂags,
on your mean deck and that's about

Nope this pack isn't really worth
the dosh, mainly due to the poor
quality of the games, but it's a
ﬂippin' good idea, and let's hope
that well see many more packs
creep up.

pack that we're
offered from The Disc
Company and this is much
more like it.
Three of the best games
that Microprose have ever
published have been
shoved onto a fast as you
blink piece of red plastic.
This is far more the type of
thing that CS owners would
like to slot in their holes (and 1
you thought that the Viz
review was dirty).
Stunt Car Racer
This won our YC Wobbly
Awards 1989 for the best
game and best simulation,
and it's hardly surprising. If I
had to name my favourite
Amiga game ever Stunt Car
Racer would certainly be in
the running, and
unbelievably the C64
version is just as good.
Not so much an arcade
game, but more fun to play
than any other racing game
on the market.
Rick Dangerous
This set new standards in
arcade adventures and the
original was only marred by
a terrible multi-load system.
Now everything is
instantaneous we can all
enjoy the most playable
platform game this side of
the local arcade. It was also
cute before its time.
Micropmse Soccer
Not the best footy game on
the commie, but close. What
it lacks in options (which is
not much I can tell you) it

nother System 3 success story makes it to the
C64GS, and thanks to the release of the truly
stunning Last Ninja 3 and Ninja Remix on cart,
those fans will undoubtedly ﬁnd a whole new challenge
in this gun toting meaty package.
Using the same system as the Ninja series, Vendetta
could hardly fail to impress. That said it has many
features of its own to more than impress.
You are a grunt (a soldier not a whiffy fart) who has
had no problems in getting out of Vietnam. But now that
you have ﬁnally been accepted into the society a
scientist friend and his daughter have been kidnapped
by terrorists and this makes you mighty sore. So armed
with but a bread knife you decide that you should go
after the assailants and remove their most private parts.
But the 3D arcade adventure part is not the be all
and end all of Vendetta, nope we even get treated to a
rather
splendid
driving
game that
links the
levels. And
on
cartridge (I
know I've
said it
before)
there is no
wait
between
sections.
I reviewed when it was out on
cassette and gave it 94%, and it has
weathered the time (almost a year) very
well indeed. The graphics, sonics and
play have only since been bettered (in
my view) by a select few games and
surely a console owner would rather
have a game that would last for yonks
than a quick licenced ﬂash in the pan.

of the way before I
start, we reviewed
this game back in the May
edition of VC, or more
correctly Ashley reviewed
it. He didn't like it for a few
reasons and only gave it a
humble score of 64%. At
the time I tended to
disagree with him, and now
that I've seen it on cartridge
I've ﬁnally got my chance
to do so publicly.
Myth is an arcade
adventure set in various
mythological backgrounds,
as you, the small Michael J.
Fox lookalike, have been
plucked from today's world
and have been sent into the
past in order to give a big
ugly god a
right royal
kicking.

the mightily evil Dameron
though, you have to
negotiate lots of other
entities. These are based
around major gods in
mythology, and you must
use your wit and reﬂexes in
order to progress past
each.
Everything is based on
the old platform game idea,
but it extends far beyond
that. There are also ﬁghting
actions that you can (and
must) perform for instance,
and there are tonnes of
small puzzles that must be
completed in order to get
anywhere whatsoever.
The animation in
absolutely superb, and
although the graphics are
tiny they're very perfectly
drawn. On the cartridge we
also get a new intro screen,
but that's about the only
addition (apart from the
lack of multi-loading of
course). In my eyes, with
the great success of such
platform games as Rick
Dangerous 1 and 2, System
3 have by far the most
accomplished of them all,
and unless you are actually
hopeless at such games
(the gameplay can be a tad
hard until you've played it a
few times) you'd probably
more than welcome Myth
to your growing cartridge
pile.

THE YC
STAFF OVER
THE YEAR
n 1990 we've had
quite a few
members of staff,
some with beards and
some without. Here's
a rundown of who
was who...
Rik Henderson - Deputy
Editor (January -
February), Editor (March -
December)
Rik's the kind of guy that
puts a lot into something
(as long as he doesn't
have to tidy up
afterwards). If you invited
him around to your house
you'd be likely to have
quite a few laughs, but
your alcohol cabinet
would mysteriously
become more roomy by
the end of the night.
Rik is still the Ed of this
organ.
Adrian Pumphrey -
Games Editor (January -
May), Games
Correspondent (June)
Adrian, the great yeti that
he is, added a certain
touch to YC that could
only have come from one
with so much facial ﬂuff.
Although his gruff manner
caused a few nightmares,
his cheeky northern
humour brightened up
many press conferences.
Adrian is now the
Editor of our sister title
Your Amiga.
Paul Eves - Technical
Editor (January - April,
August), Group Editor
(September - December)
Paul is also the editor of
Commodore Disk User, a
rather ﬁne, if more serious,
magazine. This doesn't
mean that he's the old
stoney face that
everybody reckons, he's a
mean gameplayer when it
comes down to it.
Paul is still Group
Editor.
Stuart Cooke - Group
Editor (January - June),
Editorial Consultant
(August - October)
Stuart was the editor of
Your Commodore for most
of its life, until an upstart
came in. He's had the
shakes ever since.
Stuart is still at Argus
Specialist Press, and is
Group Editor of such titles
as Photography and
Skeleton Crew.
Jim Bluck - Editorial
Assistant (January - April)
Jimbo was the unsung
hero of the reviewing
team. He left to join Video
Today as Assistant Editor
and has no inclination of
coming back to the
computer industry (it's too
stable for him).
Jim is now the editor of
the adult magazine Video
X, but we'll not mention
what he reviews now.
Mark Newton - Designer
(January - June,
November - December)
Mark, the original
chainsaw animal, slapped
the paint on the canvas
for many months. His
speciality is creating a
whole new look, it's a
shame that he still insists
on the ﬂares though.
Mark has now moved
from YC onto sister mags
CDU and Your Amiga.
Ashley Cotter-Cairns -
Staff Writer (March -
May), Games Editor
(June - September),
Assistant Editor
(October)
Ash is still with us in heart,
mainly because none of
us will forget his wild taste
in shirts. He left when he
found out that jeans were
banned from the ofﬁce.
Ashley is now with
Micronet.
Helen Saunders -
Designer (August -
November)
Helen is the current art
editor to give YC that
special look. Her talents
were recently moved
across to Your Amiga, but
she's back with some
more killer ideas.
Helen has now taken
over from Mark on the
design duties, again.
agsrws L O O K  A T  1
It's time to get out my crystal balls and give
you a few pointers on what I reckon'll be
'happening' in the coming year. Everything
here is absolutely, completely true*...
Audiogenic will announce Jeremy Beadle's Ludo
Challenge (but probably release it several years later).
Codemasters will release another three trillion Dizzy
games, and claim that the company's now bigger
than Gazza.
System 3 will release an extra-enhanced version of
Ninja Remix, adding such features as a new loading
screen and a pretty new box.
Grandslam will disappear once more and come back
a month later, with Liverpool FC still on the schedule.
Rainbow Arts will release Denaris 2, but will have to
withdraw it because it's too similar to R-Type 2 (and
far better anyway).
Virgin Games will look for even more diverse licences
than Monty Python and Viz, and will end up signing
Antiques Roadshow.
Ernap will look for a larger venue to hold the next
Computer Entertainment Show after complaints
about overcrowding. In the end it'll be hosted in the
superb° outside Charing Cross station.
*This is a lie really (Ooo we are naughty)! We've got
no idea what's coming up, but you can bet that
we'll be keeping you up-to-date all the way.

but it's true there's
nothing I like better
than driving down the
wrong side of the
motorway at 120 mph with
my head out of the window
shouting "whoop, whoop,
all aboard the last train to
the afterlife." After a recent
spell of hospitalisation with
the glorious NHS (Hmm,
severe internal injuries,
fractured skull and
shattered legs Mr Evans.
Here, take this grubby old
Asprin and think yourself
lucky it wasn't serious), I
hobbled into YC HO to put
the latest arcade
conversion from Domark
through its paces.
First up let me say that
as far as Tengen games as
converted by Domark go,
they've mostly been right
old crap. After playing the
dismal Amiga version of
STUN I was dreading
seeing the result of ﬁve
minutes chugging from the
knackered disk drive we
use. But lo, the game came
forth, and verily, it was a
mighty game, full of joyous
programming and
spanking gameplay. Yes,
despite the fact that I had
the poison pen ready and
dripping I was
disappointingly impressed.
Huh, its not bad then, said
the vulture atop my
monitor, ready to pick over
the games lifeless bones.
No, Samuel, I said, I'm
afraid this one is alive and
kicking.
Enough babble, to the
game then. STUN stands
for Spread Tunnel
Underground Network (as
if), and offers you (yes you)
the chance to race through
•
24 levels (some different)
before attempting the
ultimate challenge (which I
thought was trying to get
some sense out of Rik, but
obviously the programmers
haven't met him). After
listening to what
passes for
music

(unconvincingly) you can
either start on level 1, 6 or
11. Good idea really if
you're the sort of joystick
buffoon that can't sort out

further than the ﬁrst level.
The idea is to

rampways, collecting

bomb style destruction).
running over speed ups for
ever more mega speed
(though not faster than the
speed of light, because if
you did, you could ﬁnish
the game before you had
actually started - or so the
theory goes), shooting any
old blobby sprite that gets
in your way, and ﬁnishing
the course in the time
allowed.
In the tunnels the idea is
to go along the ﬂoor on the
straights, and on the
outside curves on bends
for max performance. Go
fast enough and you can
even loop over the ceiling
down the other side. At this
point you're gonna be
impressed with the decent
speed of the 3-D graphics.
You aint gonna be
impressed with the sprites
though. The green stars for
example are actually green
squares. Oh well, its fast
enough and its playable
enough so who cares. The
rest of the sprites are
ordinary looking solid
blobs that come your way
and then get blown away.
There is actually some
difference between the
types so if you're feeling
particularly observant then
watch out for the train. This
chugs along the bottom of
the tunnels and takes a
good kicking before being
destroyed.
Other threats to look
out for are drones,
armoured drones and
ﬂyers (which drop missiles
and bombs - eek). Just nail
the mothers before they
even think about doing
something nasty.
Well, blimey, STUN
Runner isn't as exciting as
a night out with Kim
Basinger but then it is a lot
cheaper, so if you feel the
need for speed, just say no
to drugs and make yourself
a nice cuppa while waiting
for this STUNNer to load.

slightly iffy

when you're

yourself ﬂying in any

stuck on the scenery.
For all the chaos,

Plenty of entertaining frenzied b asting action,
but the graphics are a mixed bag and the
game doesn't grip you like a mad dog.
consciousness altering
drugs shoot the s
your system ? C'mon guys,
get into the real world huh?
Anyway, in this latest just
say no to coffee cup of
pixeloid action you are out
to waste the Mr Big
Corporation. This entails
blowing away all Mr Bigs'
henchmen, over 12 levels
before you ﬁnally get to give
Mr Big himself his just
deserts (custard and
bullets).
The action starts off in a
junkyard (it says here - it
looks nothing like a junkyard
to me though) with swarms
of villains surging towards
you, all in need of cerebral
ventilation (their heads
blowing off to you). You can
always arrest them for
bonus points, though this is
hideously dangerous. The
idea is you stand next to
them for a few seconds and
they get nicked. Huh, all the
bleeders are ﬁring away like
its the start of the USA-Iraq
war so getting anyway near
to someone is like well
dangerous. Best just to
blast holes in them, or use
the odd missile and blow
them into burgers and legs
that go ﬂying everywhere.
Actually you need to save
your missiles for further on
in the game, especially if
you manage to catch up
with Mr Big.
Along the way, the levels
take you through a subway
station, Krak Street, a drugs
lab, Sunset Strip, the actual
HQ of Mr Big, encountering
such characters as Skyhigh,
Joe Rockhead (the druggie
JR E A/11E4A!
obviously), Spike Rush, and
Kinky Pinky.
Usually the idea on each
sideways scrolling level, is
to blast everybody in sight
(sod this arrest them lark),
collect re-supplies of
bullets and missiles, nab
cash for bonus points, and
gut someone who drops
the credit card pass you
need to get to the next
level. While the
backgrounds are quite
good in places (and look
like Lego in others), the
sprites are a bit of a
disaster. You, rubber mask
and all, look okay, but the
villains look like incredible
blobbo monsters.

Obviously the result
of too much caffeine.
ODonlcha hate it when a dog bites your bottom and just
won't let go no matter how many times you shoot it through
the brain!!!

H
may hail from the
wastleands of the
north, but I never even
saw a ﬂy (too cold you
see) until I moved
southwards to live with all
those soft southerners.
Anyway, ﬂies have nothing
to do with ESWAT from US
Gold, which is the
Birmingham mob's rather
sickly counter to the all
conquering and truly
majestic Robocop 2. In
fact to compare ESWAT to
the sparkling magniﬁcence
of Robocop 2 is like
comparing the intellectual
capacity of Rik Henderson
to my very good self. Not
only is there no contest,
the judges (if there were
any other than me) would
declare the contest to be a
mis-match and send poor
old ESWAT off to school
for 15 years before it could
hope to be mentioned in
the same breath as
Robocop 2.
Actually it isn't a bad
game at all (you just can't
compare it to you know
what). The plot, as such, is
that criminals are running
riot in Cyber City, and only
the really tough guys in
the ESWAT team have the
gonads, and verily, the ass
kicking ﬁrepower to book
them a one way ticket to
the morgue. Yup, there's
none of your namby
pamby criminal
rehabilitation programs
here, it's a case of blow
the mothers away before
they get away. However,
there's a small problem,
before you're allowed into
the ESWAT team you have
to complete three
missions (thus arresting
with terminal prejucide) to
earn the promotions that
will allow you to wear a
suit of baking foil.
This isn't too hard,
especially if there's two of
you blasting away at once,
though you need to keep
an eye on the bullet supply
situation, and then nick in
front of your mate to nab
the bullet token before he
gets it. It's sideways
scrolling action, with
particularly dull graphics. I
mean the scenery is
minimalist on a foggy day
stuff. Still, at least the
criminals appear, and get
blown away, with
satisfying frequency, and
there are ledges,
buildings, and even the
insides of collapsing
buildings to traverse.
Wiping the fodder on
0He may be 'ard but take it
from me, I'm 'arder! Once I
swallowed a chainsaw, while
it was still going, and I even
stapled my underpants to my
bottom. "Albert get out of that t
sandpit now and come in for
dinner!!!" "Yes mum! I'm
coming."

the ﬁrst three levels is like
dead easy, with only the
anchor wielding bad dude
on the ﬁnal (pre-ESWAT)
level posing any sort of
danger. Once you've felt
the collar of all these
villains, you make it into
the big league, where you
are notiﬁed of particular
victims to go hunting for.

It gets tougher now
though, 'cos some of the
bad guys are wearing
baking foil as well, but you
can ﬁre three bullets at
once. This does mean you
tend to run out of ammo
very quickly, so top ups
are always required,
otherwise you are reduced
to clumsy martial arts
manouvres to (literally)
kick ass.
All this is just a prelude
to the major league
violence that comes
further on though. When
you get kilted out with
heavy duty weaponry, it's

The annoying thing is that
while you are kitted out in
your ESWAT bacon foil
you're still susceptible to
being shot. Huh ! What
about protective armour
guys, this suit has zero
defence capability (rather
like Shefﬁeld Utd).
Never mind, it's all
good fun, especially on
two player mode, and
even if it doesn't measure
up to a particular Ocean
game, so what, ESWAT is
still a laff and a
half in its own
right.

TIME
MACHINE
Here's my effort this
month, the complete
solution to this ever so
stiffy arcade adventure.
And it's about time too
(that's pathetic - Ed).
Level One:
The Prehistoric Era
First you must drop a
capsule in screen 1.2.
Then shoot the eggs. A
a couple of times) using
the pods. Now go back to
the screen you started in
(1.3) and block the
geysers with the rocks.
Now you can go to Level
Two.
(Note: This bit allows
you to complete the
playable demo free on
our October cassette).
Level Two:
The Ice Age
Place a pod in screen 2.5
(by the cave) and go to
the wood in 2.2. When it
is in the top window,
beam to 2.5 and you'll
ﬁnd it has come with you.
Go to 2.1 and
transport yourself back to
the Prehistoric Age. Now
transport the ﬁre from
screen 1.1 to 2.5. Do this
until the wood has ignited
(if it goes out do it again).
Now take off the
boulders from the
Pterodactyl will take you
to the cave screen (1.5)
where you drop another
pod after which you must
warp back to 1.2.
Stun a mammal and
take it to the cave (do this
geysers in 2.3, and plant
a pod by the river in 2.4.
Zap back to 1.2 and
transport apples to the
river on 2.4 (do it for both
banks). Now you can
access Level Three.

Level Three:
The Stone Age
Firstly you'll need to build
a bridge across the river in
3.4 (mainly for the next
level). You'll need to go all
the way back to the ﬁrst
time zone and get the
Pterodactyl to take you to
1.4. When you are in the
area where the tree is
likely to be, transport to
the corresponding
position in zone three and
you'll fall out of the air
onto a branch, therefore
snapping it. DO this for
both sides of the river.
Now take the round
wheel across the river
from screen 3.2 to screen
3.5 and leave it next to the
square one. Level Four
now awaits.
t _  A

Level Four:
The Middle Ages
Go to screen 4.5 by
standing in the middle of
screen 3.5 and
transporting directly,
otherwise you'll be
spanked by the whizzing
cannonball. Take the
barrel of gunpowder and
take it to 4.4 and drop it
on the right side of the
bridge.
Place a pod next to
the barrel and wait for
the large geezer (Goliath)
to get near it. Now
teleport back to 1.1 and
collect the ﬂame. Now
teleport back to 4.4 and it
will ignite the barrel,
killing Goliath when it
explodes.
Then take another
•
barrel from 4.5 and drop
it in 4.1 near the moving
rock. Place a pod here
and then follow the same
instructions as before in
order to ignite the
powder. Now you can
enter the last level.
Level Five:
Repairing The Time
Machine
Go to screen 5.5 and kill a
few terrorists. Wait for a
bomb and transport it
back to 1.1 where it will
explode. The crystal that
you need to collect will be
freed but will fall into the
swamp.
Search 1.2 and you'll
ﬁnd it. Go back to the time
machine (in 5.3) and place
a pod inside it. Return to
the crystal and take it
back to the machine.
Go back to Level One
and use the Pterodactyl to
take you to the centre of
screen 1.1. Now teleport
to 5.1 and you'll land on
the roof of the Vid Oil
building. Use your beam to
turn the switch on and off.
Go back to the time
machine and place the
crystal in the machine.
Follow the same
instructions to turn the
switch on again and go
back to the time machine.
Now get in the machine
and perform a pick up,
you've completed the
game.
IVAN 'IRON MAN' STEWART'S OFF ROAD RACER
Here's a few tips for this spiffy top-down racing game
from Paul Milburn. A crisp ﬁver is on its way!!!
1. A t  the ﬁrst corner (on all tracks), swing wide and
cut in sharply next to the barrier, the nitro off.
That should give you a big lead.
2. Tr y  not to use any Nitros on the ﬁrst course. This
allows you to concentrate in spending your
money on wheels, top speed, etc.
3. When you have lost 2 credits, change cars and
you can continue onto the next track with fresh
credits.

T
spiffy game out a
couple of months
ago called St Dragon, from
the Sales Curve. Dragon
Breed is like that, but not
as good. If you didn't see
St Dragon, then read on,
otherwise you can look at
the screen shots now.
You play the role of
Kayus, a lanky young lad
who has become King of
the Agamen Empire. Alas
the rest of the chaps at
court aren't too happy
with this and have broken
the seal restraining
Zambaquous, the King of
Darkness (who, while
being utterly evil, does
send his mother ﬂowers
every month). This Z
person wants to bring
-plague, pestilence,
everlasting darkness, etc,
etc to the world, so its
down to young Kayus, sat
atride his loyal dragon to
sort the blighter out.
Although its not all ﬁery
breath antics for our
airborne chum, when the
going gets narrow, the
small go walking.
Its the usual business
of sideways scrolling
shooty action, with
swarms of your typical
twiddly little aliens, and
then larger ones obviously
made up of four sprites.
Obviously because when
they appear and move
onto the same line as your
character, they ﬂicker like
buggery. So does your
dragon, except he does it
all the time. I think he's
probably trying to become
invisible, or something.
With a ﬂexible and
manouvrable tail thankfully
your dragon can be used
to fend of shots, and when
you collect some power
up tokens, it becomes
even more useful.
Red tokens endow the
dragon with ﬂame breath,
silver give you homing
dragons (tiny suicidal
exploding baby dragons -
er su p p o se d l y), blue
gives you a share in the
Electricity board, well,
lightning bolts anyway,
while gold tokens gives
you scales. Which also
happens if you don't get
enough vitamin C.
By using a combination
of these power ups, and
the fact that your dragon
is double jointed, you can
curl the tail completely
around, shutting yourself
in, but of course no man is
an island (well he'd be a
very small island if he
was), so you need to show
your face every now and
again. To kill things.
There's a word for all of
this, and that word is
routine. The two colour
background scrolls ever
so slowly, while the sprites
ﬂicker and die under your
onslaught. It's all pretty
easy until you hit the end
of level aliens. Which are
big and nasty. The ﬁrst
one is a bit too nasty
methinks, but try it out for
yourself, since this is a
reasonable game,
if you like scrolly
shooters.
Er, words fail me. It's like St Dragon, with a
dragon and stuff, but not as good.

Dear Paul,
First let me get the
crawling out the way and
say that your adventure
column is the best thing
that's happened to me
since I last stuck my head
in the oven (errmm -
Paul). In fact I would go
as far as to say that its
brilliant, amazing,
wonderful, (remarkable,
Mary? - Paul) remarkable
(ah good - Paul) in fact
the best adventure
column I've ever seen!!!
What I'd like to know,
though, as a "mature"
adventurer, who's started
adventuring quite late on,
is what adventures do
you recommend? How
about a Top Five
adventure list? I can't get
my teeth around these
new fangled RPG things
so a concise adventure
guide would be much
appreciated.
Mary Hadley,
Newquay, Cornwall
Paul: Nice place,
Newquay, never did do
any surﬁng though, ah
well. A Top Five?
Hmmm. A toughy. But if
you pushed me - I'd
probably fall over - and
then declare that, on
the grounds of
availability, I would
recommend, in no
particular order: Time
Thief (see Vintage Vault
elsewhere), The Case
of the Mixed-Up
Shymer, A Dark Sky
E  ISJ L J  IF
A long time ago,
in a galaxy far,
far away, a pod
was sent from a
dying planet in
the hope that
the race could
be saved. In this
pod wa s  a male
child wh o  was
found and raised
by a mag g o t
f armer and his
wife. S u p e r
Rig b y now hails
as mast er of the
adventures.
Over Paradise, Time
and Magic. If you are
not familiar with any of
these titles, then never
fear, I'll be covering
them all in forthcoming
issues. Yes, there are
other titles out there
but, unless you're
lucky, the majority of
computer shops tend to
ignore adventures
(Time and Magic being
the only commercial
one of the ﬁve you'd
see with any regularity
in computer shops, the
others are mail-order
only). Just in case,
though, I'll also be
covering the quickly
disappearing
commercial stuff - just
in case your local shop
stocks it.
Dear Paul,
Yo! Slick, cool dude that
you are, gimme ﬁve! (Oh,
hello there young man -
Paul) Me and my brother
have read every issue of
YC that you've been in
(yes, I'm still trying to
remove the staples from
my jacket - Paul) so we
think we should both get a
prize for being so loyal
(what? - Paul). Anyway, as
YC has a regular adventure
column now how about a
few hints'n tips'n things?
Although I'm a mean man
with the plastic keys I still
get stuck - my brother's
hopeless, so you're my last
chance!! Help!!
David Pearce,
Stockport, Cheshire
Paul: Er, quite. By all
means. I would love to
help you and your
brother out in your
hour of need but what
on earth are you stuck
on? You can tell me
David. So go on, write
in again. Let me know
the title and precisely
what the problem is
and I'll do my best.

re
ist
e
re
All of the adventure mags
covered so far have, in one
way or another, offered
hints, tips, reviews and
general entertainment for
adventure players. The one
obvious missing piece in the
wealth of information
already provided for the
beneﬁt of the adventurer is -
how to produce the things in
the ﬁrst place. This is where
Chris Hester's Adventure
Coder steps in. Produced in
AS format and published by
the ever-busy Mandy
Rodrigues (the Adventure
Probe editor) Coder is a
constant source of help and
advice for the adventure
author, those wishing to
become adventure authors
or for players who are
intrigued by the inner
workings of adventures.
So let's see what this
Chris Hester chappie is all
about, eh? Raiding his
peaceful home one Sunday
morning - myself, the YC
sound engineer, YC
photographer and YC
teamaker found Chris still in
bed. Being an
accommodating lot we all
clambered in with him -
complete with a refreshing
cup of tea and a croissant
each. Propping up a pillow
and removing a camera
tripod from under Chris's
nose I asked him how Coder
started,
"The basis for Adventure
Coder was another
magazine called Adventure
Contact which covered
adventure utilities and was
edited by Pat Winstanley,
initially, and then Colin Page
who did a few issues and
then gave up. I used to
contribute to Contact
regularly and was, therefore,
sad to see Contact go when
it did. I think it was Mandy
(Rodhgues) who suggested
that I do something else
along similar lines. Between
us we came up with the
basis for a new magazine.
"As Mandy was doing
Probe I was able to get
advice off her on exactly
how it should look - how
many pages, size, and so
on. Obviously after you've
done a couple of issues you
can work out what's going
to be best for the magazine -
content, size of
photographs, etc."
A typical issue spans
around 40-45 pages and
includes information
adventure utilities on all
computers - from C64s to
PCs, Spectrums to Amigas.
As well as utilities Coder
includes help using
languages such as Basic
and Assembler and more
general articles such as
atmosphere in adventures
and the origination of ideas
for plots, puzzles and the
like.
To date Adventure Coder
has produced 13 issues. A
fair percentage of them
being C64 speciﬁc. Utilities
such as the GAC and GAC+
have been covered as well
as the more esoteric
aspects of assembler. Other
C64 speciﬁc articles have
included a very interesting
piece on the infamous 1541
disk drive, including one or
two little gems regarding
little known disk commands.
Judging by the above
you may get the impression
that Coder is a dry piece of
techno-crap. Wrong! Chris
Hester manages to inject a
humourous, not to say
musical, style in amongst
the articles that are suitable
for the beginner and
experienced alike.
All in all, Adventure
Coder is a little cracker and,
at the measly price of E1.25,
should be standard reading.

Vault will be an
occasional feature
that will either drown you
all in gallons of nostalgia
or will inform you as to all
of those adventures that
"got away". Most of the
titles covered in this area
will still be available, in
one way or another. I'll be
covering the adventures
from the ultra-famous, the
little known and the
positively rare. The main
aim, however, will be to
give you a contact
address so you can get
your mitts on them.
As new adventurers are
arriving all the time it is
silly to assume that
everyone will know about
every adventure that has
ever been released so I
hope that this golden
oldies section will be more
of a service than a gentle
look at the past. In the
near future I will begin a
similar feature for RPGs -
watch out for that one.
TIME THIEF
As the good or text and
text/graphic adventure has
been largely shunned by
the big software houses
(they will return, when they
see the error of their ways)
the only reliable source of
adventures are the
independent mail-order
outﬁts who produce their
wares from home. Such a
company is Big Sky.
To my knowledge, Big
Sky only produced one
adventure and that was for
the C64 - but what an
adventure! The title in
question is called Time
Thief, a disk-only text-
adventure written by Don
Macleod. Released around
the Spring of 1989 Time
Thief arrives on one disk
and is divided into two
parts: Shadows & Light
and Ironhand.
The plot surrounds a
company who deal in,
what they call, "Timeshare
Travel". Actually the
theory is a fascinating tale
in itself. Say you and a
bunch of friends, aged
around 18, want to trip off
on holiday. What you'd do
would be to take time off
your years of old age
(when you would assume
you'd be old and feeble
and not able to enjoy
yourself as much). In
effect, you could "use"
your 77th year, for
example, when you are 18
or whatever! Neat, eh? So
you would die at a
younger age (say, 40) but,
by the wonders of
Timeshare would still have
"lived" your full life span
(say 80 years).
Although many people
used the Time Portals
successfully things began
to turn sour, though, when
some people returned
from their time travel
crippled, maimed and so
on. Jocasta, a top
academic travels to a
place and time where the
trouble appears to
originate from. It appears
that someone is "stealing"
time and, therefore
causing mucho problems.
She disappears, though,
so you must follow her to
see what happened and,
possibly, catch the time
thief yourself.
Time Thief is a tour de
force in C64 adventuring.
Probably the most
amazing aspect of this
game is the combination
of reams of text and no
disk access! Now why
couldn't Infocom do that,
eh? Don has used both
machine code and the
Quill adventure utility and
has utilised some nifty text
compression techniques
to make all of that
possible.
The game, which mixes
fantasy and SF very
successfully, oozes
atmosphere and will
reward careful
examination of objects
with ﬂowing and elegant
prose. Although Time Thief
uses the Quill and,
therefore, only allows the
basic two word input you
shouldn't be put off
because the game design
never really exposes this
limitation as two word
inputs are all you will need
anyway.
With a wide range of
puzzles - some
comparatively easy, others
utter sods - beautiful text
descriptions and
responses and all of the
atmosphere you could
wish for in an adventure
you either buy this game
or declare yourself as
barking mad.

GB - Yes, who is this?

SLIGHT LIST
I have recently read my
friend's ACU (Amstrad
Computer User), that
load of crap, but there
was one thing I liked in
it that YC does not have
and would make YC a
lot better. It had
programs that you could
type in yourself.
I have always enjoyed
typing in my own
programs, so please can
you print one or two
programs in each issue.
Also, I have recently
bought Hammerﬁst. I
saw it in the shops for
E3.99 so I thought 'why
not?'.
I agree with your
review a few months
ago and even think you
could've given it a
better mark. I have got
past the ﬁrst screen,
but I can't complete the
second, please could
you tell me how to get
to the third screen. W .

E r i c - W E
Finally can you tell
me how to get past the
locked door on the
second screen of
Knightmare (on the
December free tape).
I think YC is the best
commie mag ever!
Matthew Gibson,
Billericay, Essex
PS. Please, please,
please make this letta of
the munf!
PA: Let's get everybody in
the ofﬁce to vote on
whether to make this Letta
of the Muhl or not.
Rik - Yes!
Helen - Nope!
Evesy - Nope!
Me - Nope!
So there you go, tough
luck! As for the games
hints, I'll pass your letter
onto Ooze, and see if he
comes up with something
in the future.
We got rid of listings
way back because of the
tape, and it's unlikely that
Rik'll bring them back. By
the way, did you know that
Rik used to work for ACU?
(YES!!! - The bored
readers)
COVER STORY
Erm... Er... Where's the
cover to tape no. 6 then
aye?
YC is brilliant but it
needs more colour.
Paul Mullett,
Milton Keynes
PS. Who are you Rik?
PA: I think I'll get Rik in
here to answer this one.
Rik: I am a ﬁsh, wibble,
wibble, wibble! Not tonight
Josephine!
PA: There you have it, not
even the local asylum
knows who Rik is, and Rik
certainly doesn't. As for
the cover to tape no. 6,
why don't you get out your
pencils and draw yourself
one? In fact, why don't all
of you do that and send
them in, and we'll give a
prize to the best tape
cover that we receive (like
a new set of pencils or
something).
QUESTION
TIME
I bought the 9th issue of
YC for the ﬁrst time and
it was great. I really
enjoyed playing the
games on the free tape
and I like the pictures of
Oozin' Eugene and
yourself. I also like the
Purple Puzzle Page.
Here's a few
questions...
1) In Shadow Warriors,
why did you give the
graphics 8 out of 10?
The graphics of the
game are shocking.
2) What game do you
think has the best
graphics and sound?
3) Why the hell did you
put a poster of the robot
in Dr Who in the issue?
4) How much is E16.99
in Australian money?
5) What does PA stand
for?
That's it for the
questions, I'm looking
forward to the next
issue of VC. See ya!
Andrew Kotsiris,
Melbourne, Australia
PA: Cor, ﬂippin'ell! Let's
see if I can answer your
plethora of queries...
1) Rik must've thought the
graphics were rather
good, let's hear what he's
got to say: "I thought that
the graphics were rather
good!" There you have it!!!
2) I think that Last Ninja 3
is just about the best
game ever for graphics,
sound AND ganneplay (and
I agree - Ed).
3) Have you ever been
threatened by a large
metallic beasty with a
goolie zapping gun? I
think not!
4) As far as I can tell, with
the world's economic
state, that you should use
this equation: Aussie
Dollars = Number of
people in Aussie land x
British Pounds + The
amount of members of the
Ramsey family in
Neighbours. Therefore
E16.99 = about 400 million
Australian Dollars
(probably).
5) Anything you want it to.
Most people take it to
stand for my initials
generally though.
SHOW BUSINESS
Having just returned from 'The Commodore Show' (or should this be the
'Amiga' show?), I was extremely worried about the future of our dearly
beloved C64.
It would seem that according to the staff of several of the software
stalls at this 'Amiga' exhibition, our faithful Commodores are now past
their best and are only ﬁt to be consigned to the great computer land in
the sky.
Most comments, when requesting software for the 64, were "It's had
its day", "Not powerful enough", and "The 16-bit is far superior".
I must admit the only satisfaction I got was from the Ocean stand
where a certain character, wearing an Amiga (there's that word again) T-
shirt, assured me that Ocean is still going to support us.
Don Langridge, Sevenoaks
PA: Yep, we were there to (see last month's Data), and things were far worse
than dire. Good news though is that companies have not been swayed by the
few that think that the commie is no longer commercially viable.
It still sold in bucketloads this Chrimbo, and with the C64GS now in
operation, it seems as though there are trillions of games on the horizon.
The next time somebody mentions the superior 16-bit machines, do what I
do and they'll ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to pee standing up ever again. And remind
them that ﬂares made a comeback, and they're disgusting.

G
Mutant Turtles this,
Turtles that, you
couldn't draw breath
without smelling pizza, you
couldn't switch on the TV
without being assaulted by
a four year old episode of
the cartoon (and this is an
overnight sensation ?), and
you couldn't go shopping
without some guest
appearance by a half wit in
a half shell waving a rubber
katana Congratulations go
to Mirrorsoft for having the
nouse to sign up the biggest
cross marketing exercise for
years, and riding the hype
all the way to the numero
uno spot. But what about
the game ? Ah yes, well do
you really want to play the
game ? I mean if Mirrorsoft
had stuffed the box with
stickers, a plastic turtle and
a comic then most people
would have been happy.
Not us though, thanks to
the demand for the damned
game we had to go out and
buy a copy. And what
goodies do you get in the
box, what little extras to
supplement the game are
thrown in free, just how
generous has Mirrorsoft
been over the festive
period? You get a postcard.
And the plastic disk bag is
green. Jesus, don't go
overboard guys.
So to the game then, and
the PLOT (TM - incidently
did you know there are 22
TMs on the box ?). April
O'Neil has been kidnapped
from her news van by
OGo on dude, hit him with your rather munchy, but highly illegal
ninja weapon! (By the way, the green blobby thing is you!)
Shredder, so you have to
rescue her from the sewers,
or wherever she's being
held. On top of that you also
have to work your way
towards the Technodrome,
home of Shredder, and kick
his ass before retrieving the
Life Transformer Gun (which
will turn ratty master Splinter
back into his original human
form). This being set in New
York, no-one would
probably notice the
difference.
So that's the idea then,
take control of each of the
turtles in turn, as you ﬁght
your way through the
various levels, searching for
April. Though you can only
control one character at a
time, you need the speciality
skills of each turtle at the
appropriate time to combat
the various menaces thrown
at you. Well you're
supposed to but
I went through
my turtles like a
Jap
businessman at
lunch, so never
had the chance
to employ those
sort of tactics.
Each turtle
has a strength
rating, which
disappears at an alarming
rate, but can be replenished
by copious slices of pizza, if
you can ﬁnd them. What's
annoying are the enemies
who just walk forwards and
into you, giving you no
chance to out ﬁght them.
You chop away, but they
cost you half your strength
before they ﬁnally disappear
in a puff of smoke.
Most of them are
indistinguished blobs
anyway, so its no great loss.
There are two types of view,
one is outside on the
streets, which is sort of
Gauntlet like, and looks
awful, the other is inside
buildings and sewers, where
you get a sideways on view.
The turtles are well done,
and the backgrounds are
okay, but the opposition are
poorly drawn. At least you
can leap around quite
sharply, even if you don't
have many moves to make.
Bad news really comes
on the music front. It's so
bad and grating you just
have to turn it off sharpish,
before everyone else in the
room starts throwing stuff at
you.
Compare the Turtles to
Last Ninja 3 and you see the
turtles looking green for
another reason. To be
honest this is mediocre city,
but with everyone jumping
on the train into town
without seeing where they
were going, disappointment
awaits at the destination.
Huge hype, great marketing, but a dull and
uninspiring game, and bugger all freebies in the
box.

TREVOR BROOKING's
WORLD CUP GLORY
So me  people say that timing is
everything in football. Wh a t  time the
pubs open, wh a t  time you get to the
ground, wh a t  time you b eat the hell
out of the other supporters, etc.
Trevor Brooking used to have good
timing wh en  he was a player, but
that was s o me  years ago and since
T B W C G  has c o me  out six mo n th s
after the main event, his p o wers
are obviously on the wan e.
D u n c a n  Ev a n s  catches up with the
old codger.
C
well known for it's
strategy games, but
not for all action
entertaining graphics.
Trevor Brooking is well
known for his match
commentaries, but equally
not for all action graphics.
Bring the two together and
wile strategy may win out,
YOU don't really expect
visual excitement.
This, if you hadn't
guessed (because you
were thick or something) is
a game of the last world
cup, so quite why greyhair
Trey has endorsed it is
anyone's guess since the
world cup he played in
was in 1982. And that
didn't involve much glory
either, 'cos both him and
Kevin Keegan couldn't
score the goals we
needed against Spain.
However, you have
inherited a team which has
suffered a series of
depressing results and is
now well and truly
downhearted. Your task is
to restore the conﬁdence
of these witless one
legged blind mutes to
Germanic arrogance and
raise the skill level to, er,
Germanic excellence. In

strategies and bolster the
conﬁdence of the boys by
playing deadbeats like
Albania.
That was the plan, we
lost 2-1 and half the squad
committed suicide the
next day. Each player has
an ability and a ﬁtness
rating, and you can train
both of these elements up
between games. It's
surprising to see the form
of some of your stars
swing so wildly though.
Lineker might be rated 4
this month and 10 next
month. The other thing
training can improve is
team work, though the
value of this is
questionable. Even with
team work rated as good,
with decent players
sprinkled throughout the
squad, and playing an
-ordinary 4-3-3 formation,
England still went down to
Albania.
The actual process of
entering players into the
squad and from there into

OThat Trevor really knows what he's on about doesn't he? I
mean it's not as if he just quotes the obvious or anything,
I'd even base my entire tactics around his inﬁnite wisdom!
the team formation is
unbelievably tedious. I
mean, you'd think
Challenge would have the
sense to carry over the
players from one game to
the next instead of forcing
you to re-enter every
player for every game.
This really is stupid.
Balancing your
formation is important, as
is getting the ball down
the wings, though the
number of shots on goal
that your forward line
produce is sometimes not
accurate with regards to
their numbers and quality.
At half time in a game,
be it world cup or friendly,
our mate Trev sticks his
oar into the procedings
with such telling
comments as "The lads
will be disappointed with
this ﬁrst half. England's
right side looked strong
but Albania had the better
chances and possession."
Ta very much Trey, there's
a bundle of stats on the
Callar2
TEN THINGS YOU NEVER KNEW
I ABOUT TREVOR BROOKING*
He didn't play for Farsley Celtic in the
Woodmills League.
His dad was called Mr Brooking
His mum wasn't.
Trevor means 'Dark haired wanderer who like
moose' in Eskimo.
He scored the winning goal when West Ham
beat Old Etonian Strollers in a FA Cup tie in
1878.
Trevor likes bourbon biscuits with a hint of
mustard.
Mr Brooking is one of the BBC's highest paid
commentators, earning in excess of four million
pounds per match.
My aunty used to know someone who lived in
the same street.
Trevor prefers lime green socks.
Despite everything Trev is still one of the boys
and can be found dog baiting at his local pub
most nights of the week.
*But only three of them are true!
text only match display
which tells you as much.
So I wasn't expecting
graphics, bull was
expecting polished
gameplay and
professional displays (and
not just from the team).
Would you believe the
Spectrum version is far
more polished than this
amateurish looking C64
game. While there is a
reasonable football game
under there crying to get
out, sloppiness and
unprofessional ism have
rather strangled it.
There are even ﬁve skill
levels, with the ﬁrst and
easiest being challenging,
and the rest getting
harder. Very balanced I'm
sure.
Average sums up the
actual game, but shoddy
sums up the way it works,
and the look of the
whole shooting
match.

Trevor Brooking's world cup glory was at
least nine years ago, which explains why all
the menus and text looks so outdated.
Difﬁcult to actually use, the gameplay doesn't
redeem all the shortcomings.

H o w a y  the lads! G a z z a 's  ﬁnally
ma d e  it again, b u t is this seco n d
a t t e mp t  at footy fun just fog on th e
pitch o r Geo rd ie joys? R i k
H e n d e r s o n  slap s his G a z z a  and
Friends L P on the d e c k  an d
w o n d e rs  if he'll e n d  u p  crying af t er
loading Emp ire 's  latest effort.
I F  rom 13 year old
spotty adolescents
who use naft
aftershave, but have never
had a hair on their face in
their lives, to 40 year-old
women who are made
gooey at the thought of a
young man who cries
almost like a nineties' Tiny
Tears, everybody's heard
of the mind-gobbling
entity that is Paul
Gasgoigne (apart from one
old crumbly judge with his
public school tie shoved
ﬁrmly in a place where
only the headmaster has
seen before).
And it seems that
footballing brilliance is not
enough to qualify you for
superstardom nowadays.
You need to weep a few
bucketloads of salty
perrier to be recognised as
a hot merchandise
property. Just think what
the world would be like
now if Pele had blown a
nose-full of snot into a
hanky and snivelled when
he missed that famous
pitch-length shot in the
1970 world cup.
But maybe shedding a
few tears is not all it
cracks up to be, because
it musn't be forgotten that
Gazza, he who was to be
left behind instead of
playing for England in the
1990 world cup, wowed us
all with a superb form of
soccer skill that made him
invaluable to our team set-
up.
I'd like to think that it's
down to this reason that a
latest game has been
released with his
nickname emblazoned on
the cover, that and the fact
that the previous attempt
was so crap. There was a
need to make up for the
former disappointment.
So how has it been
done? Well, you remember
Kick Off don't you? Picture
that in your mind, ﬂip the
screen the other way
(horizontally scrolling,
instead of vertically) and
glue the ball to the player
in control's leg and you've
got Gazza II. Oh yeh, slow
it down a notch or two as
well.
It's not all been done
before though, in fact Gli
tries desperately to be
different to any other footy
game. It certainly
manages to cram a lot of
strategy and what could
be passed for
management. The only
problem is that it seems to
be for this fact alone that
the game falls below the
excellent level at which its
sponsor so often
performs.
You see, every player
has an individual level for
otaniesple, mat well known Liverpool penaity taker, lines up
to slam one home with only 33 seconds left on the clock.
I'm not telling you whether he scored or not, but let's just
say that the replay's on Wednesday!

stamina, running, kicking,
passing, control ball, and
tackling and at times it
seems that the commie is
having problems coping
with the vast amount of
factors in just simply
running the ball from one
end of the pitch to the
other. Therefore, even the
fastest player on the pitch
runs as if he's done
something rather nasty in
his shorts. And there's
also the option to be
injured, when this
happens (and you've got
no more subs on the
bench) you may as well go
make yourself a nice cup
of tea 'cause it'll take
hours to get from one end
of the pitch to the other.
This said, Gazza II still
offers a lot. It's far better
than Kick Off and Kick Off
2, for instance, and
graphically it beats the
lego men style of most of
the other efforts. And it's
tonnes better than the
original game. In fact
there's only one game
that's better (in my
opinion), because it has
many more options, and
that's Manchester United.
If there was more of an
incentive to play, such as
a league or cup, as well as
having different weather
effects and pitch type
(which it does very well), it
would be worthwhile
suffering the speed at
which the game plays. I
suppose we could be
grateful though that
there's not even a musical
note that coincides with
'Fog on the Tyne' or
'Geordie Boys'.

rather splendid really, but
it lacks that certain

twenty bottles of dog
breath strength cider, and
that year was 1987. As is
the way with these things,
along came Sanxion and
though completely
derivative, it was a
spankingly good sideways
scroller. Delta is not that
game, Delta is the one
Stavros Fasoulas came up
with after Sanxion, and
unfortunately showed that
Stavros really didn't have
any imagination.
Delta is also a
sideways scrolling blast
test, but one with a
tortuously difﬁcult method
of acquiring power ups for
your desperately sluggish
and torpid ﬁghter. It does
have some sort of plot, but
you wouldn't want to know
it, and features a cunning
method of exchanging
cash from destroying
aliens, into big boy
weaponry. If you run over
an icon that you can't
exchange dosh for, it
destroys you (talk about
short tempered).
Graphics and sound
are reasonably good and
slick, but Delta offers little
for todays gamester at this
price. The most telling
point is that shortly after
completing Delta, Stavros
joined the Norwegian
Army.

Who can resist a game
which proudly offers you the
chance to become a suicidal
Kamikaze pilot ! With piddly
graphics reminiscent of irT

there he was playing
away in his native
jungle, when suddenly,
bad wobbers came and
stole tickle elephant away.
Dey wanted to take him to
a zoo, but lickle elephant
he was clever, and he
jumped out of the
aeroplane and glided
down to the ground with
his umbwella. And now
you have to guide the
tickle elephant all the way
home, starting off in
France.
Pass the sick bucket,
it's another of those cutey
games, but this time with
real six year old mentality
and not just cute graphics
(which aren't that cute
anyway). So you've got
control of the elephant,
armed with jumbo snot
power from his snozzle
and jumbo exploding pie
power from his.. er, I don't
think we should go into
this. Anyway, armed with a
prodigious amount of
elephantine lives, you have
to leap and jump, and ﬂoat
(with the umbrella) your
way around hundreds of
trap laden platforms as
you attempt to get home.
Unfortunately, Elephant
Antics is one of those
game where skill counts
for nothing as you explore.
You explore a bit, and ﬁnd
all the traps. Then you play
again and jump over
where you know the traps
to be but can't see them. I
hate this sort of game. It
artiﬁcially makes you play
longer, by forcing you to
play the same bits over
and over again as you
slowly navigate your way
through the hazards which
you can't see coming or
avoid, as you don't know
they are there until you've
either run into or fallen
onto them. Grrrr.
Then you've got all

have come up with.. guess
what for France ? Just
guess. Frogs of course.
Laff ? I nearly strangled the
cat.
Controls are okay,
thank god, and when
falling your descent is
controllable, so if you miss
a jump then at least you
can try and guide yourself
down to safety, and of
course it means no deaths
from falling 20 feet (which
would be quite unpleasant
for an elephant actually).
So full marks for making
the mechanics of the
game playable. The music
is predictably party
(balloons and lemonade
type of party) like, with jolly
sounds all the way
through, and the graphics,
while hardly impressing,
are pleasant and sorta
cute (ugh I hate myself for
admitting that) in places. I
just don't like the damned
design ! Other than that
you can't really complain.
So those with plenty of
patience and a love of this
sort of game step
forwards, and you can
have my copy.

Another cutey game, this time from the pre-
pubescent Codemasters, geared towards
progression by error and repetition, that
doesn't score highly in the graphics
department, but is certainly playable enough.
a public domain
version of Wings of
Fury and music that
sounds like a
Japanese band
trying to play
Western music on
badly tuned
instruments, initial
omens were not
good with this
Codemasters attempt. But
how wrong we were,
those lacklustre graphics
strained and animated to
their utmost to give us a
game of unrestrained
Japanese and 'Who won
the war anyway' jokes.
The object is to shoot
down a ﬁghter, collect its
supply of explosives
before they hit the ground,
then dive bomb the gates
of the tower holding your
fellow yellow perils
hostage.
Succeed and a new
level featuring more tanks
and jet ﬁghters, jetpack
riders ﬁring lasers, and all
sorts of other rather silly
and out of place
aeronautical contraptions
compete.
Though hard, and
requiring Mongoose like
reactions rather than
actual timing and
perception, Kamikaze is
jolly good fun, though it
might offend limp wristed
lefties and Jap
sympathisers. But then
who won the war anyway.

KWIK SNAX
Codemasters
E2.99
If there's one thing you
can rely on the Oliver
twins for, its a simplistic
game with little or no
scrolling, environmentally
damaging (supporting
MacDonalds is despicable
dear boys), and usually
quite good fun for the
under 10s. Kwik Snax is
much the same game as
Fast Food (even down to
the title), which was a
previous Pacman style
game.
Kwik Snax is basically
more of the same, with a
couple of cute characters,
the object of rescuing
Rufﬂes and leading them
to safety. All
that needs to
be done, is to
head for the
hatching
Rufﬂe eggs,
run over the
beastie and
lead it to
safety before
the horribly
wobbly
monsters eat
them.
Simple stuff, not a great
deal of fun to play, the
graphics don't impress at
all, though some of the
characters are engaging
enough, I'm afraid Kwik
Snax isn't very tasty at all.

According to David
Darling, you have to play
this game to believe it.
That isn't because the
packaging is full of lies,
but because the actual
game is somewhat
different from the run of
the mill game, and
certainly a departure for
Codemasters. It shows a
spark of originality.

games that you still see
in fun fairs. An additional
worry is that each time
you tilt the table to
wobble the ball around,
you use up power, which
rapidly runs out. There is
a backup power
available, but unless you
are near to ﬁnishing then
you've had it anyway.
After four easy
courses come the one
with traps, and then the
ball gets bigger. Good
stuff, in a mindless sort
of way, but it does offer
an increasingly difﬁcult
challenge, and is a laugh
for a few mates on a wet

and, I'd wager a large
amount of dosh, probably
wreck those as well.
Melbourne House's
(God, are they still
around?) new strategy
game allows you to have
ﬁrst hand experience of
planet domination, in this
latest attempt at capturing
the Sim-City fans. What is
weird though, is that
Supremacy was
developed and
programmed initially on
the 16-bits and seemed to
use much of the powers
that those particular
machines offer. On the
C64, and this is the weird
part, there seems to be no
cut backs in anything
(wow!!!). Gameplay, check!
Sonics, check! Even
graphics are there in force.
But the biggest question
is, was it any good in the
ﬁrst place?
Most 16-bit mags
thought so, and even
compared it to such greats
as Millennium 2.2 and
Populous (two games that,
sadly, never made it to the
commie). Its strength lies
in the fact that although
the strategical part is fairly
complex and engrossing,
there are ﬁve
progressively harder
computer-controlled
aliens, that also have

similar plans to yourself, to
defeat. But defeat them at
what?
Planet domination of
course! You have several
planets in a solar system
and you have to populate
and defend each. When
you have set up your base
camps on some of them,
and your opponent
likewise, you can then
attack the alien's worlds
and become ruler of the
whole system.
This is not that easy
because you have to
populate and build an
army up on each planet by
converting it from a truly
barren lump of rock into
something that can
support life, and this all
takes a lot of thought and
time.
Supremacy has been in
development now for
almost two years and it
does tell. There is
enormous depth, and it
certainly seems a lot more
polished than Sim City
was on the C64. Strategy
games fans should be
salivating in the prospect
of getting their grubby
mitts on it. We'll be given
you a full review next
month.

ON THE
DRAWING
BOARD
T
eh? When four
sweaty hippies were
crammed around the
largest coin-op in the
arcade shouting things like
"I'll get the potion!", "You
shot me you buffoon!", and
"Aargh, you're stepping on
my toe!" And boy did that
machine gobble up the
credits when you'd
managed to get yourself
and your team down to the
ﬁftieth level and the whole
party were surrounded by
deaths. The youngest of
you will probably think
"what the hell is he talking
about, the big lummux?",
but the rest will cry in
unison "GAUNTLET! Ah
yes we remember it well."
It was a classic, and
even though the home
computer version was a
mite bugged, that was a
classic too. So was its
sequel, and The Deeper
Dungeons, with tonnes
more traps and loads of
new features, but
unfortunately all the clones
seemed to spoil the fun,
and now we come to
expect multi-player games
as a way of life, if it aint got
it we aint buying it.
Therefore there seemed
to be nothing more that
could be done to raise the
popularity of what was one
of the world's best
concepts in game design.

Surely there is no way
back for the top-down
maze game, with creepies
and crawlies, and treasure
chests and traps, and exits
and teleporters, or is
there?
Actually there certainly
is, because US Gold is
about to resurrect Gauntlet
completely, with the
introduction of Gauntlet III
in wonderful 'seeing is
believing' 3D. This is
through a Last Ninja type
of perspective where you
see the action from a sort
of squiffy 'from the comer'
view point, and although
the gameplay remains very
similar, there are more
monsters and, more
importantly, four new
characters to chose to play
with. Again you can invite
a friend to participate, but
you're more likely to spend
most of your time oggling
at the wicked
graphics than
smegging the
plethoras of ghosties.
The major
difference, though, is
that there are only
eight levels of play,
unlike the hundreds
adopted by the
original, but each one
will be quite
enormous, and will
involve more puzzling
and arcade-adventure
style gaming than
ever before.
Although it's taken
a long time to reach
us you can bet that
it's been worth the
wait. Gauntlet 3D is the
original concept being
brought right up to date,
and if it was anymore
'happening' it'd be wearing
ﬂares and listening to the
Happy Mondays.

duo's help and over the
years they've remixed
singles, broadcast during
Kiss FM's pirate days, won
awards and even worked •
with staunchest indie
group of all. The Fall.
And now they've got a
video. Their press release
bills it as Coldcut's "Cyber
Chaos" 'Longform' video.
And it's got oodles of
computer graphics. There
are six dance videos on
the tape. It's musical
content comes from the
DJ album "Some Like It
Cold", which ranges from
the electronic-sounding
"Ride the Pressure" to
"Find a Way", an
ideological track featuring
Queen Latifah. What's
more, all the graphics (
which are mixed with live
action) were designed and
executed on Apple Macs,
Amigas and Archimedes'
rather than a mind-
bogglingly expensive
Quantel Paintbox.
So just who are the
responsible parties?
SCENE 2 - THE
MUSICIANS:
"I used to be a Defender
ace" says Matt Black, half
of Coldcut. He used to be
a computer programmer
(on an, ahem, snort Oric -
a computer which had a
market proﬁle as high as
an ant in a sandstorm
even when it was ﬁrst
launched) and a
biochemist - he even built
a synthesiser at school -
while partner Jonathon
More was a silversmith
and an art teacher - They
met in '86 and, as the intro
to "Hart to Hart' goes,
-
was murder".
Asked about
computers, Matt offers
Xenon II and Space Ace as
fave games but adds: "I
really got into Golden Axe.
Me and a mate spent
pounds on it. More my
speed is Starglider 2,
though. I'm also into 3D
Tank games."
Coldcut don't just play
games on their hardware.

As well as using
computers for music, Matt
says: "I had an Atari and
used creative software
with it - now I've got an
Amiga. A lot of them blow
up but ours hasn't and I've
got a great Cyberpaint
package." In fact, Matt
designed many of the
video's graphics; "I've
always drawn, my old
man's an artist". He uses
Deluxepaint and has a
Polaroid palette machine
to get hard copies. His
favourite of the video's
tracks is "'Ride the
Pressure', because most
of my Amiga stuff's in
that." He adds, "I'm totally
into Cyberpunk and Philip
K dick is a continuous
source of inspiration."
With this project as in
most others, Coldcut don't
make a major physical
appearance. "Jon and me
are more mad scientists in
the background."
Concluding he says, "I
knew one day machines
would get cheap enough
for good graphics. It's
4 p a r t y  time for everyone
now ..."
SCENE 3 - THE
CREATORS:
Robert Pepperell and Mils
Visman run Hardwire video
productions. The two left
college two years ago and
wanted to carry on using
computers. So they did.
They've since enchanced
(ie. added swirly graphics
and such) vids not only for
Coldcut but for Inner City,
Spiritualised, The Darling
Buds, Lisa Stansﬁeld and
The Fall (them again).
"It started off with DIP
and design but we'd
always really been into
video, we were also very
into computer graphics
and their potential."
explains Robert.
Hardwire's greatest
achievement was "In
Deep", Coldcut"s
Christmas single. "It was
the ﬁrst broadcast quality
video produced
completely on
microcomputers." offers
Robert, "it made the point
to a lot of people that you
could do fun animation on
relatively cheap hardware.
"There's no correlation
between the quality of the
video and the amount of
money spent. There's a
general snobbery about
quality, we're trying to
break that down and to
stretch the hardware to
the limit, trying to produce
new and different effects.
We try out new
technological
combinations. We're
having a good time with
the technology and make
a living out of it!"
How do they go about
designing and making a
video, then? "We never
actually plan what we do,
we improvise! The
inspiration is partly set off
by lyrics in the songs but
we alo try to make the
video suprising. We're
always trying to come up
with something wacky and
new."
"The better a song is,
the better the whole thing
is eventually. You have to
try much less hard with a
good thing to keep it
interesting."
"I think Miles would
really like to do a video for
Public Enemy. Any band
that's musically interesting
- not bland US rock that
we have no sumpathy
with."
Have they ever come
up with something toally
weird city? "The video we
did with Coldcut and Mark
E. Smith (of the Fall) is so
weird that people can't
watch it and there was an
image in the Queen Latifah
track of a creature with
thousands of arms. We're
not allowed to be as weird
as we want to be."
They've been looking at
demo disks recently.
"That's where we see it
happening. What these
young programmers have
got out of the Amiga is
E
incredible. Thier
programming skill has to
emerge somewhere, it
can't just disappear but
there are no outlets for
computer graphics. That's
probably why the PD
network has sprung up.
Something's going to
happen.
"There's no recognition
of this kind of art. That's
because those sort of
institutions (such as the
Arts Council - who hand
out cash to struggling
artists or, more often,
don't) are run by forty and
ﬁfty year old men. Perhaps
when they die things will
change ..."
